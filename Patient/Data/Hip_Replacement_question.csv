"hi im ryan, 34 year old male and in the next couple of months I'm going to be having a ""complex double hip replacement""
I'm absolutely petrified about having this done as I'm worried I won't make it out the operation. I already have a rubbish immune system and I keep thinking there is no way I'm going to be able to recover.
I deal with horrendous anxiety and I'm constantly in bits everyday not knowing what to do. My brain keeps telling me to not go through with it, but I currently can't walk no more than 5 meters without being in severe pain. Is there anyone on here that has had a complex double hip replacement before? and could maybe help put my mind as ease.
thanks
Ryan

"I'm originally from England, living in the Netherlands. I have OA and FM throughout. I also have OCD and a myriad of anxieties. I recently had a pelvic X-ray and MRI to determine progress of OA after 15 months of limited mobility, only to be told I need a right THR . It came out of the blue and I've been prioritised for surgery because it's bone on bone and my leg keeps collapsing under me. I know what to expect surgically, but have no idea what I'll be dealing with post-op...
All my docs and specialists are Dutch, with varying English language skills and I've been made aware of what will happen pre-op and during the surgery and been told I will be home the same day which seems crazy fast to me, after a major surgical procedure. I've scoured Google looking for more information but it all seems to be horror stories of pre-op deep tissue infections, which my OCD brain does not need to be over-thinking.
Q1. Coming home the same day would mean I would be able to walk again pretty much straight after the op.? I don't understand how that can be. Has anyone else been on their feet again the same day.?
Q2. How much pain is there post-op.? I'm not good with pain, but I can endure it if I have to. I usually use 800mg Ibuprofen, but it seems like I'll need something stronger, will I.?
Q3. The hospital gave me crutches to use, but I have OA and FM in my hands and arm joints, so I can't use them. How easy is it to move about at home without aids post-op.? Or am I having a laugh at thinking I'll cope with the stairs and using the bathroom alone.?

"Hi. I am new here and hoping to get some advice. I have had both hips replaced, the last one over a year ago. Since then, I was having lower back pain and pain in my legs (outer sides) and groin after sitting for a period of time. This is still bothering me and I have been to at least four different doctors. My hip surgeon said it was bursitis and I had some injections which did nothing. I went to a spine doctor who said I have 3 herniated discs in my lower back and tried some injections... nothing. A new doctor referred me to physical therapy; that guy said it was muscle related and after 11 sessions and no relief, I stopped going. Tried another doctor who said it was nerve related... more injections and a recent nerve ablation for my spine... I am STILL in pain. The pain is hard to explain because it varies depending on the time of day. If I rub from my outer hip area down my outer thigh area, it is really sore, almost feels bruised. Do you think I should return to my hip surgeon? I get so depressed with this going on and not knowing what it is from. Thanks!!

2 days post surgery and still in quite a bit of pain. Pain meds being managed but I'm good at asking for help as i don't want to make a fuss.
The big thing for me today - 2 days after my op - is that I am very emotional and can't seem to control my tears! Is this 'normal'?
i hate asking for help all the time and this is making me feel a but useless. I try not to let anyone see I'm upset because I don't want people to think I'm weak or pathetic!

"I had a total hip replacement over 3 months ago. I recently went back to work at a job that has alot of walking on ceramic tile. I am a 62 year woman who is over weight. My surgery went great. I'm walking fine, but I notice after a long day at work I'm soar and favoring the leg. A few suggestion - keep moving, do your exercises, and don't give up! My first Doctor I went to would not do the surgery until I lost 20 pounds. Don't know technical words, but he replaced hip on top of thigh. Went to a different doctor who did it on the side of thigh but robotically. Not cutting of muscles. HUGE difference in recovery. Secondly I had a spinal instead of anesthesia. Another big difference! I was in and out during surgery but in recovery I felt great. I went home that night. Am I soar somedays because of walking at work, but nothing like before I had the hip replaced. Find a doctor who uses robotics, accuracy of replacement critical. My family and friends are in shock by my recovery. I love this forum, so many questions addressed. Good luck.

"I had anterior left hip replacement April 5, 2022 and all well except that at first I noticed and mentioned post op to Dr that I felt like my left leg was shorter and also developed a click in my neck when walking with no pain there. All going exceptionally well, but am concerned about the neck click. Seems like when I really concentrate on walking a longer stride and making sure I step heel to toe I do not feel it. Just wondering if anyone else encountered this as it is still happening. Am thinking about waiting another month and then going to a chiropractor to have it checked out there.

"I've been lurking for a while (sorry) but I must say thank you for all of the reads. Sometimes at my most worriesome moments I would read here and feel a little better knowing I wasn't alone.
Anyway - I'm 40 years old and after about 7 years of pain which always seemed to be localized in my knee - and every time I went to the dr they shooshed me off saying nothing was wrong with my knee - I finally found a good orthopedic who said ""maybe it's not your knee - maybe it's your hip"". Sure enough, X-rays then showed severe arthritis in both hips - worse in my left. Tried medication and cortisone shots - nothing worked so off to surgery it was.
Had an anterior approach surgery 7 weeks ago today. Frustrated though as I was told that after 6 weeks I should be doing good. I have given up the walker and the cane. Every single time I get up, those first handful of steps are excruciating!! Sometimes I have a limp, sometimes I don't. I still take prescription meds at night and sleep with a gazillion pillows and my ice packs. Most nights I can sleep for 3-4 hours - then I'm up again. I take ibuprofen during the day - trying to give up the pain meds but if i don't take them I can't get through the day. My husband says I'm doing so well - I feel like I should be doing better and it's getting me down.
Why so much pain after 7 weeks? So frustrating. I have to do the other side within 6 months (earlier If the pain gets worse) and I'm terrified. I just want to feel normal.
Anyway - wanted to say hi. Finally got enough courage t join and hope to chat with others going through the same things.

"Hi,
First post here, great forum, just found it tonight!!
Ok, so I'm a 38 year old male from the UK, married with two kids.
All my life I have always been very athletic......sprinted for my county, played football since I was seven etc.
Around seven years ago........I started to notice after football that I was starting to get very stiff the day after............then it started to extend into two days after......three days after and so on and so on. But I was finding that it had eased by the next game so I carried on playing and just dealing with the midweek pain.......then I started to notice that I was becoming noticebly slower, could lift my left knee high enough to sprint properly or quickly. I just put it down to age and the opposition getting younger.......until I started to notice that I was struggling in comparison to all my peers!!
After a few years I went to the doctor, had a few xrays and physio sessions...to be told I had severe hip arthritis of the hip!! Proper shocked......felt that was what ""old"" people got......I thought I'd just need an operation or some physio and be back to normal!!
I then got referred to Doctor Treacy at the Orthopeadic Hospital in Birmingham....he said it was pretty bad and that ""You will need that resurfacing in the next 12 months""........that was four years ago and he's been saying the same every year. All this time I had an attitude of ""I'll prove you wrong"" and have continued to play football, even through the pain, but now feel that I'm at the end of the road and need to do something about this.
Dr treacy said that I'm a prime patient for Hip Resurfacing as I'm youn, male and active and want to remain active. I know this is a hip replacement forum but can anyone give any insight into their own experiences of Hip Resurfacing;
- How was the surgery?
- How was the recovery?
- How has it been since the surgery?
- Do you regret it? Or wish you did it earlier?
I've resisted it for years but feel now is the time........I've always been active but this has decreased severely over the last 9 months to the point that I've put on weight because I'm less active........my flexibility is ridiculous, I can't even get anywhere near putting my own left sock on!!
I've got friends still running marathons, Triathlons and Iron Mans etc and I can barely run the length of a tennis court without my left leg dragged behind like some lame animal........it's starting to make me depressed thinking about the active things I can no longer do and will never do again currently.........
Any help, advice or personal experience of similar would be great appreciated!!

"After 2 failed scopes dysplasia was diagnosed and a RTHR was performed 12 weeks ago .I have always been as active as my hips would let me and also work full time. I am now so limited to what I can do and the pain is worse than before the HR in different ways. since the operation I have suffered with si joint pain, groin pain and very bad pain in my bum cheek, I get deep tooth ache pains in thigh area also. the si joint pain has subsided drastically thank goodness, but still twinges now and again. The groin pain is unbearable on first standing to walk from sitting it almost feels the worst pulled muscle and as if my leg will give way or snap. once walking after a few steps it eases and I'm left with a uncomfortable but manageable pulled muscle feeling. the bum pain I'm thinking is muscular as it eases once I've massaged and applied heat but is short lived and soon returns. i can't bend easily to put shoes or socks on as groin feels like it will snap. I am so disheartened as my hip pain has been an on going battle for 6 years and the hip replacement was going to put an end to it all I hoped. I am due back at work and obviously can't due to all these aches and pains. I am on a waiting list for physio but do complete stretches and exercises daily, I also do alot of walking. despite the pains I do push myself hoping it's muscular and it will all loosen off and I will be pain free. I am worried something is wrong. I have spoken to the Dr who prescribed naproxen and referral for physio. I am going to phone my surgeon soon as Ive been hoping time will heal but I've been like this for weeks now with no improvement. I apologise for the long woe me post but thought I may get some answers or reassurance from this group. thank you I advance.

"Hi
I've just discovered this resource, so greetings to you all.
I'm a 59 year old male with a long history of endurance sports. Three weeks ago I had a posterior LTHR.
All seems to be going well in terms of recovery apart from in one area - night time sleep. I was using meptid and paracetamol during the day and opiates/oramorph with some success at night but recently decided to stop the meptid/opiates/oramorph due to the brain fug I found I was having during plus constipation issues. So now I'm down to taking a couple of paracetamol during the day and the rest of my daily allowance (heeding the four hour rule) through the night.
But I'm unable to sleep at night. It's like I'm wired on caffeine (I'm not) - could this be some kind of opiate withdrawal which will pass? I don't feel in great pain... a discomfort, for sure but not bad pain like immediately post op... so am loathe to use opiates just to help me sleep.
When did you good folk knock out your heavy painkillers? Any advice on night time sleep, accepting that I'm doing all the stuff you would expect to facilitate comfortable sleep? I have a bottle of oramorph right next to me and am tempted to start taking it just to sleep but have a nagging suspicion the solution is to persevere without opiates rather than step back and begin the whole process again.
Thanks in advance.

"Had a total hip replacement done in Jan 2014 - not sure whether its a fault of the surgery or my body not doing what it should have but the muscle that was cut through has not re-attached at all.  As a result of this I struggle to walk very far as there is no muscle strength to rely on which means I am worse off than before the surgery.  I have worked really hard to strenthen my core muscles to compensate but it hasn't helped.  Has anyone else had the same problem?

I am nearly 73 and female.
I had a THR right hip February 2021 and was lucky, I had no problems sleeping despite thinking I would wake myself up snoring whilst lying on my back!
This time, my THR for left hip, last Thursday, has been much more troublesome, it's more painful and less maneuverable, but the worst is the lack of sleep. It's too painful to sleep with at night, despite the maximum allowable painkillers. I have tried pillows in various places etc., and I have ended up propped up on a lot of pillows which allowed me to doze a bit.
Do you have any tips, please?

I've had my second THR (3 weeks ago) and this time (first one went great - flew through it), I've had a few problems. Blisters from the steri-strips which are thankfully now healing. But the one thing that is driving me nuts is what feels like pins and needles or numbness in my calf muscle, ankle, foot. Gets worse at night. To the point, it hurts if anything touches that part of the leg. This is in the leg that I got the surgery on. I had mentioned it to my surgeon on my 2 week checkup and he told me to take off the stockings - they might have been too tight. But no improvement.

I'm 40 yeats old and had avascular necrosis of the rigjt hip.I had a titanium disc replacement 6 years ago in my lower back so I was aware going into surgery it would not be easy. However, when the epidural wore off after the hip repkacement I was in agony, in fact I was in tears and did not sleep a wink until after 5 days when sheer exhaustion set in I have pain in my groin when I move my leg it feeks like it's grating on something.I also have pain down to my knee including my knee. My lower back again is in agony also my right buttock feels like it's being pinched all the time all the way down the back of my leg which I guess is sciatica. I saw the surgeon who preformed the hip replacement today, he says all my pain is coming from my back. What I can't umderstand is why am I in more pain after the op then before. My surgeon was very unhelpful saying I need refered on for my back by my G.P. Has anyone else had excrutiating pain after a total hip replacement. I can't believe the surgeon dismissed my pain and said the hip is fine when the horrendous pain im in only started after the operation. Like I say I'm looking for people with similar situation or knowledge and advice.

"Hi,
Ive had a right THR three years ago at sheffield and and its been wonderful. Just recently Ive been walking most days about 3 miles, and in better weather go about 20 miles on my road bike twice a week.
Im mindful that the more distance I do the more wear I will get. At age 72 im also aware, if im lucky I will only have 5 or so active years left. So its a compromise.
Am I over worrying about wearing the hip out or should I continue at my current rate. Most if the rest of the day Im sat on my bum.
Its a nice problem to have but just wondered if anyone has any thoughts on this.
Everyone knows of someone who has gone back to be a top runner, cyclist,or tennis players but its very hard to find history of these type of people past five years.

"8 days post Anterior Total Hip Replacement
Got diagnosed with end stage arthritis on my right hip at 29. Apparently an undiagnosed child hood trauma injury. Finally had THR about 8 days ago. Thought I壇 share what my days look like lately for anybody that is going to have to have the same procedure
How my day looks after hip replacement surgery
wake up between 4-5:30am (due to pain)
6am pain medication
Brush teeth, hoping soon to add wash face
6:15am - 11:30 ice compression machine
Coffee (made by someone else)
Breakfast (also made by someone else)
8am more meds
8:30 PT (right now I can do toe points about 7 knee raises)
11-noon nap if I知 lucky
Noon pain meds
12:30 - If I知 not in too much pain go up one flight of stairs as part of PT to have lunch
1:30 walk to office with walker as part of PT & work as long as I can
2:15ish lay or sit down because I知 exhausted again
3ish back downstairs for more ice therapy
5ish attempt shower and put on clean clothes (favorite part of day because showers are my new best friend)
Change wound dressing every 3 days
May have to lay down from exhaustion from shower and getting dressed
6pm more meds
6:30ish back up stairs for the last time for dinner and PT
8pm more meds
8:30pm final stair journey down for the day (these are usually the hardest even though down is easier than up)
8:30-11pm ice therapy
11:30/ midnight more meds.
Sleep. If I wake up at 1am in writhing pain it痴 time to take the hard pain meds otherwise I値l be up ever 45mins or so.
Last night I slept 6 hours which is the longest stretch since coming home from hospital
..Repeat..
Every day gets a little better. The nerve pain in my legs and feet is lessening. I知 still having some muscle spasms in glutes, thighs and side. Right side is still sore and incision has started to itch. BUT I知 seeing improvements. Night sleeping is getting better. Healing is a journey.

"hello everyone
im nervous about posting on here as I never in my life thought I'd be on a forum for patients so in some ways it is good I've learnt some humility as always thought I was indestructible as I've always been very sporty playing a lot of tennis, football, rugby and cycling  as well  as regular gym sessions. 
Im 42 and last year after persistent groin pain that wasn't overly painful but nonetheless noticeable and wasn't going away after about a year I had an MRI scan, the results of which showed a FAI and laberal tear. My consultant told me the space between the ball and socket at one point was about 0.5mm and therefore I was too far gone to even attempt keyhole surgery and that I needed a THR of right hip. Being the cautious sole I am I had a couple of other opinions by consultants all of whom said same thing. 
I kind of didnt take it too seriously as i wasnt in great pain and was still very active, playing a lot of tennis running and cycling. The most noticeable thing was during sexual intercourse in missionary when I could feel a grinding sensation in the groin and clicking. Obviously that became somewhat of a passion killer. 
As time went on the pain was pain was getting more noticeable during tennis and my consultant suggested cortisone injections and sinvisc plus. The cortisone injections did great but only lasted around 3 weeks per injection. I didn't notice any great difference with the sinvisc plus. 
Still up to around april/may this year I was still playing a lot of sport and walking fine. But then in June during a very brutal game of tennis while hitting a running forehand I experienced an almighty crunch in the hip and a bit of pain,  not too much as I'd only just had last cortisone shot. This was a Saturday when the crunch happened. 
No problems on saturday evening or sunday Sunday but the Monday when at work after being seated when I went to get up I was in agony and couldn't move. Hip/groin locked. 
Since then this sensation continually happened if I bent my leg then tried to straighten it. I had an injection into a tendon that my consultant said was getting trapped and that did work but only for two weeks. I was at the stage where getting off toilet was a massive challenge. Once unlocked it wasn't too bad. I could walk ok and pretty quick. I noticed if I did no sport (or sexual relations) the locking subsided but as soon as I was more active the issue came back. My consultant told me it was a very personal choice when to have a THR but my quality of life was being affected and the aim of a THR was to improve that quality. He then told me about the Superpath technique which I loved sound of and he was one of very few surgeons who did this. I elected to have the super path and it was done on September 15. 
Im 19 days post op and can walk with one crutch pretty quick but when I try without a crutch I'm struggling as hip is stiff. I can bend leg upwards well and outwards and can squat. Obviously no locking now. 
 my concern is I've seen you tube videos of people able to cross their legs and walking with no aids at all and in no pain. I have no pain when lying down or sitting down save for a bit of soreness where the wound is but my main worry is I do get a lot of groin pain when exercising or trying to lift my leg keeping it straight. Also when I walk the groin hurts and while other pain seems to be getting better the groin doesn't at all. 
I go for my first physio appointment in two days time and I'm worried that this groin pain means something isn't right. I've gone into so much detail as wanted to explain how I was before the operation. Has anyone had the superpath and if so what were your experiences at this stage. I've read somewhere that the illopsis tendon can be damaged and of course when I was locking up before the THR I wonder if that tendon took some damage. 
 sorry if this is really long winded but it's all very stressful as I've never so much had a filling in my teeth let alone major surgery so I'm not sure where I should be and what I should be doing. 
Thanks in advance for any replies.

"Still recovering from THR (R) since 10/2018
Surgeon damaged my Femoral nerve, needed blood but he wasnt prepared to give any during Sx: i passed out next day- he ordered
1 1/2 units, then the nurse (1 nurse) how to me sit up and get out of bed. She let me stand there while she walked away and I collapsed to the floor.
You would think I'd have a lawsuit. But I don't. The attorney said the You would think I'd have a lawsuit. But I don't. The attorney said the femoral nerve damage is an expected risk and forget medical protocol for the surgical patient, one nurse in my room, for nurses and the doctor put notes in my chart about my fall. My attorney said you'll be fighting City Hall.
so here I am 2022 with a permanent limb, using a walker when needed, swollen knee constantly and now my ankle is starting to swell on a regular basis.
I had a second opinion however after seeing the second doctor for three months, he decided my surgeon was right I'm OK. But I'm not OK. Do I have hip pain no but I have a right leg that does not function like it did before surgery.
in order to keep me from going crazy mad over this, I always know this could be worse. I am walking I'm not taking thousands of medication's. I can't get to the floor can't kneel down can't squat but I get around so I guess that's my silver lining. But if you're ever in Frederick Maryland do not use Andrew Jones as your surgeon

"Five years ago I had a left side Total Hip operation. I've had trouble with it ever since. It started to get numb during physiotherapy shortly afterwards. The numbness has continuously become worse; it wakes my up at night because even though it is numb there is a pain within.
I desperately need help now because after the operation my left leg was at least 1"" shorter, which has caused my right leg to take the strain; then suddenly the cartilage cracked through on my right knee and I am in agony with that too. I can't walk without support and I am at the stage where I need to see a top consultant because I'm getting nowhere at present and need some very good help and advise please.

"hi hippies,
I had my right total uncemented hip replacement just 4th February.
now I know it takes a long recovery ( I had a left THR in 2016).
but though I have been home a few days now I am finding it really hard to cope with the fatigue.
I am snoozing only one or two hour periods because have to keep going to pee.
I dont think I have a UTI because have no cystitis type symptoms or difficulty passing urine. However I did have a catheter post op for two nights due to post operative retention.
Today I have taken an over the counter stat dose of oral fluconazole for PV thrush which I am certain is from when I had the catheter in.
My pain is varied and managing this by use of Paracetamol, Ibruprofen , coedeine 30/60mg.
I have tried to use the analgesia around one thing every two hours so pain free most of the time. The worst has been that in evening I have had nerve pain excruiating nerve pain in the right thigh and knee. That responds best to cold and the large dose codeine.
Iam eating small bits food. Fluids good.
I just would appreaciate any top tips thus far to refresh my memory of the things you may have found helped in the early days.?
Thankyou. Ange aged 60.

"I had my right THR three years ago. It's been brilliant. I've done lots of walking, tennis etc.
In November 2021 I had a cheilectomy, to deal with bone spurs on the top of my right big toe joint, which were making hiking increasingly painful and difficult. I was warned it might take up to a year to recover fully from this surgery.
Well - the foot has healed well, and I think the recovery is going pretty much to plan. Initially I had to keep my leg elevated for most of the time for a whole fortnight, then I started walking very carefully pretty much on my heel, then on the heel and the outside of my foot. For about two months I wasn't able to exercise much, although I did the recommended toe exercises. Recently I have been able to get the big toe pretty well flat on the ground again, and I have started to be able to do some 3-4 mile walks. My gait is improved but it's not back to normal yet - it still feels rather jerky and slightly unbalanced.
My hip has started to complain! It's keeping me awake some nights. I think it has been ""thrown"" by the change in my walking, and maybe I am trying to do longer walks too soon.
Has anyone else had subsequent foot surgery on the same side as their THR? Has anyone any advice?

Not been on for a while, hoping everyone is recovering well.
I am 12 weeks today post op. Was due to go back to work today, but still not had my 6 week check up. Finally going this wednesday. I have lots of questions and conerns, which i am hoping will be answered.
I wanted to ask though, how people felt after 12 weeks? I still suffer with pain, particulary in my back. I am trying not to use my crutch, but walking with with a gaping limp still, which is affecting my knees, which was the same pre op. My right knee cruntches and swells as the day goes on. Plus i have a compressed nerve still in my non op side, which keeps me awake most nights. Thought by now i would be getting back to normal and ready for work.
Anyone else still suffering at 12 weeks?

"hi All
Ive had hip dysplasia since birth on both hips. progressively worsen these last 5 years.
I was in chronic pain, severe mobility issues and walked horrendously bad.
in Dec 2019 had first hip operation on hip which was the best of both hip but still bad, and that went well. in Feb 2021 I has the other hip operation (would have been earlier but c19 hit)
Since I have good and bad days and appreciate I had OA /arthritis, but maybe I'm wrong but thought having Operations would clear the oa/arthritis?? I've been on to consultant as some days I literally can hardly walk. the first leg operated on like freezes and feels like a lead weight and cannot go to work and I have stiffness in pelvis area and pain there too when I stand or bend. I get a sharp pain going through my thigh (think nerve issue here and I literally cannot take food out of the cooker or stand washing up.
I appreciate I had bad hip dysplasia but honestly thought I'd be better with the op.
am i stupid thinking that i would be better after ops?? anyone else been like this??
I feel like a fraud, but I'm not right and hoped I would be!

"I had a THR in June 2021 - my second - and I'm still unable to lift my leg up high enough to cross it with the other leg in order to, for example, put on a sock or tie a shoelace. I don't have any pain or any issues with walking.
I realise that (a) in common with most of us, I've not been very active for the whole time since the surgery; and (b) I'm quite a bit overweight, which I'm working on. Nevertheless, I feel I should be able to do more than I am now. I spoke to my surgeon who recommended some 'mild physiotherapy' but I hate physio and am wondering if anyone has had similar issues and if their condition has improved. My other THR was in 2015 and the leg moves perfectly. Many thanks in advance.

"Hello,
This past October, I went to a concert and experienced what I thought was a lower back injury. i had some sciatica symptoms and the pain was pretty severe down my leg and in my buttocks and lower back for a couple of weeks. The pain improved but still comes and goes and i still cannot walk any reasonable distance at a time. At max, I can walk a total of ten minutes before the shooting pain kicks in and my leg almost gives out on me and i end up defeated and hobble home.
I have been stretching, doing my PT exercises, have had a shot in my SI joint and an MRI on my lumbar spine. Nothing has provided me with any answers.
I know that resting helps it. and that the pain is very much localized in my hip. My buttocks, groin, hamstring and knee also feel it especially if its bad.
The pain pattern seems to be cyclical. I think Im getting better, so I push a little harder and the pain comes back.
I had a fall exactly a year prior to when i began feeling the pain in my hip. It was on my left side and it left me with a radical bruise on my left glute. I didnt think much of it. I could still walk and do everything I needed to do. But now I cant help but wonder. These symptoms seem very consistent with a possible AVA diagnosis but im wondering, would an injury a year prior cause this? could scar tissue be occluding some oxygen supply in my hip? Does anyone have similar stories?
MRIs are tricky and i have already spent so much money on treatment. I would hate to have to get another one. So Im looking for advice.
Thank You,

"I could do with some advise, has anyone ever had these problems?
I had both my hips replaced in Italy where I worked and lived due to Arthritis now after 5 years I started to get some pain in my left hip so I went to a hospital here in Thailand where I live now to have it checked out, after a number of tests they found I had quite a big infection.
The surgeon told me I would need two operations, first one to remove the artificial hip and insert antibiotic cement moulded as the ball of the bone to go into the hip socket and to leave this in for 2-3 months I was told not put any weight on it and not to use a walker only to move by wheelchair which basically meant bedridden.
I had blood tests done at the hospital every 2 weeks to check how the infection was doing,
it eventually came down from an infection count of more than 150 to only 8, but then it started to go up to over 30 the surgeon explained this is because after 3 months the antibiotic was no longer working and there was still some infection left so I would need another operation to change the antibiotic cement to a new one for about 2 months until the infection count goes down to zero.
Everything was fine for a while then after about a month the infection count strangely started to go up again the doctor tried many different types of antibiotics tablets but to no avail, the doctor explained the problem is the infection that was type S had changed to type R, because of the use of many different antibiotics for a long period the infection had become resistant and the antibiotic can no longer kill it.
So they decided to use an antibiotic that plays a role of the drug of last resort, intended for use in people suffering from multidrug-resistant infections it worked and the infection eventually count came down to 10 at my last blood test.
I went to the hospital yesterday the surgeon told me seeing as the infection is now low he sent me for a blood test an X-ray and finally a CT scan then to go back to see him again for the results the blood count had come down to only 7 now great I thought.
The surgeon explained that due to the treatment being for a long time 6 months to now have the hip implant there would be a high risk 80-20 of the infection returning and could not give me any guarantee of success, it was as if a bombshell had hit me.
He said, so now I have two options to consider replacing the hip and accepting the risks was the first or the second option would be to have an operation to remove the cement but not replace the hip this way less complications.
I would be able to walk he said but only with the aid of a walker or crutches,
I was in total shock after all I had been through and being bedridden for 6 months this was the final result.
The doctor is going to get a second opinion about my case from another surgeon that is at a different hospital.
I have an appointment with my surgeon for next Friday and he will explain what the other surgeons thoughts are and I have to tell him which option I have decided.
What a decision to make a nightmare and it's not over yet.
I'm sorry for the long post.

"Hi all,
Just here for some reassurance really. I had a THR 7 months ago and apart from a few ups and downs it's been pretty good. I have had back issues too which has aggravated things but overall my progress has been pretty okay.
Last week I had to go into the office and due to covid I wanted to avoid the tube so I walked a lot (25 mins each way) and wasn't sitting very sensibly at work. This is the first time I'd done a whole week at work because I've been able to work from home since my operation. I've been walking 20 mins a day since the op and doing my hip exercises but I do get occasional back pain so not as much as I would like.
After that week I went to the shop in the evening and while walking I developed a sharp pain around the front and back of my thigh to the point that I could barely walk. This was 3 days ago and it's still painful, although a little less so. As I've been discharged by my surgeon I can't go to him, but will of course talk to my GP if symptoms persist. I'm using a stick at home just to take pressure off.
Is this common? I thought after 7 months I'd be 100% okay. Is it a concern or should I just rest and let nature take its course? I'm not too worried as I assume it's due to me overdoing it, but it would be nice to hear that others have experienced similar and recovered.
Many thanks for reading.

"Hi everyone. I'm going to tell a big story here so I apologise in advance for the reading.
I realise that I am in the minority here but I had my THR around the age of 22-23. I am now 30 years old. This was due to being hit by a car and my hip never healing properly from the event and therefore, needing it replaced.
I was told by my doctor at the time that the ceramic hip I was getting should last around 15-20 years before needing replaced. After my initial surgery my hip dislocated within 2 weeks because I turned the wrong way.
This was a horrific experience and my doctor told me 'please don't do this again because every time we need to chip away a little at your bone which means you can only have so many replacements and you'll be needing them for the rest of your life.'
These past 8 years have been so wonderful in a lot of ways. I've travelled around the world to incredible places and done some amazing things with my life like scuba diving. I've been afforded so much more that I couldn't have done if I never had the replacement. And generally I've had no problems with it.
I am currently on holiday in Lanzarote and although this trip has been tame I've started getting more pain in my hip than I usually would get. It's a deep burning pain and stiffness. Sometimes I thought it's clicked ever so slightly. When I was going to bed the other night I was fending off a panic attack. All I could think was - what if this thing dislocates again? Then I remembered the pain and how grateful I was that I was around family and emergency services were so quick to respond that time I had dislocated before.
It's got to the point I can't stop imagining what would happen if it dislocates when I'm in the middle of nowhere and emergency services can't get to me. I worry how long would it take when I'm in a foreign country. Or what if I'm alone when it happens and I can't reach my phone? My partner keeps saying - 'just relax, that isn't going to happen!' But I fear that it could. My catastrophising is getting worse by the day.
Have any hip replacement veterans out there got any advice for me on this? It's starting to keep me up at night. We also have an amazing trip planned for next year to Japan (covid permitting), and my head goes to places like - it will dislocate on the plane and the turbulence and landing will cause extreme pain or I'll be somewhere rural and it will dislocate and no one will understand what I'm saying.
I know a lot of this is just anxiety and I can work with that to an extent, but I really don't even know is this just a sign of my hip wearing out or is it normal to go through periods of pain with the hip. I know I've put on a lot of extra weight recently and that can't be helping so I'm really serious now about getting back to a healthy BMI. What should I do about all this? As you can imagine, being my age there's not many people around me that I can talk to about this and get advice from.

"Hi All,
I had a hip replacement just over 6 months ago. I have had a constant severe systemic reaction to Titanium, Nickel & the glue used to close the incision, called ""Dermabond Prineo.""
In discussion prior to surgery, I informed my surgeon I was allergic to most metals and as such, did not wear much jewelry. . He assured me over and over that the implant was, ""hypo allergenic,"" and that no allergy testing is necessary before the procedure.
Five weeks after the surgery, a rash in the area of the incision appeared - The Doctors assumed it was ""shingles."" (they claimed its common after a stressful op)
A few days later the rash spread to other areas of the body, along with unbearable pain, burning, itchiness and general discomfort. The doctors ruled out Shingles and pumped me with high doses of Prednisone and Percocet .
POST Op and on my own accord, I have been tested for metal allergies at ""National Jewish Hospital"" in Denver Colorado, with positive results for ""allergies to Titanium, Nickel and Dermobond Prineo.
(Pri Op and Post, - the surgeon assured me the implant was ""ONLY TITANIUM"" 100%)
I have spent 24/7 trying to communicate with the medical personnel involved. No one has offered any solution, they prefer ignoring. I am suffering greatly and have communicated this.
(Only here, in this forum, did I discover one other person in the entire country, with a Titanium allergy.)
My skin, is cracked and damaged, hives cover my body and swelling of the upper dermis, I live in a constant state of pain and find it very hard to walk.
I recently met with my surgeon for follow up.
He said there was no other implant for me and either live like I am now or have the implant removed and reside to a wheelchair for the rest of my life.
A simple metal allergy testing could have prevented all my suffering and devastating, life changing, permanent, outcome. This should be a red flag as to the rules and regulations performed before this type of surgery.
btw - one leg is almost an inch longer than the other
my surgeon claims ""they have ceased using ""Dermabond Prineo"" at the facility where I had my surgery.

"Has anyone had bilateral hip replacements in the past few months since Covid? Titanium is used today, unlike the old cement way wherein every 10 yrs things had to be redone. Today I'm told that once titanium is used there's no need to redo. If you have similar symptoms to mine, please advise. Here's my short version. About 3 yrs ago pain in my lower back, which radiated to my sciatica and got worse ever since. From chiropractor, to PT, to meds, to injections. Now surgery is last resort. Once an xray ws done, I'm advised that the back pain is majority from the hips. Once surgery is done it should alleviate most of my pain. Anyone?

"Hello: I am needing a hip replacement. The surgeon I saw uses the Exeter hip prosthetic. I believe it is made of a stainless steel stem, although the nurse told me it was titanium, and the ceramic femur head is made of aluminium (aka alumina, I believe) and oxygen according to the surgeon. I am worried about all these different metals, especially aluminium since we've been told that it may cause senility. Also, I read on this forum about someone who had a titanium hip put in only to find she was allergic after it was put in.
Does anyone know the safety of the aluminium material? Also, how do you get a metals allergy test? How do you find a legit test? There is a website I found that offers these tests but you need a physician's signature to have it done. I really want to get one done before having surgery, but I am worried about whether my physician/s are familiar with the test and if any one of them will sign for it.
Is anyone familiar with these tests?

"Hello fellow Hippies,
I'm just over 10 weeks in and doing ok.  I walk around the house without a cane but still carry it outside for longer walks.  My stride is pretty good for the most part.  My problem is that I get very stiff after fairly short walks.  I have to get up and stretch and hobble around for a little while before I can really walk again.  Along with the stiffness comes some pain but nothing to extreme really but it does remind me that something happened.  I guess I'm wondering if this is normal...what are other peoples experiences after 10 weeks.

"I had a THR on 2nd Feb this year. I'm 45. I am wondering if anyone else still had pain at this stage. The pain I had is gone but has been replaced by a very tight, achey pain right in the hip. I can only describe it as a severe cramping tightness in the muscles. Ive been xrayed twice and the surgeon is happy that the replacement looks good but he cannot understand the continued pain. I have to concentrate hard to walk without a limp and if I'm not dosed up on painkillers ii struggle. Even with painkillers I can only walk slowly and not more than a half mile before the pain means I have to rest. Has anyone any suggestions as to the cause? The physio theyve given me hurts like hell and doesn't seem to be helping anything. Feel very down as i ferl like I've been through all this for nothing.

"Hi all, I had my six month THR post op consultation with the Surgeon this morning. I have been suffering severe groin pain since my operation last November and at my six week consultation the Surgeon said this pain would  likely dissapear ""over time"".....but I suspected it wouldn't but gave it six months anyway. The pain and discomfort is worse then before surgery (((
The Surgeon is now saying it's likely ""inflammation of the Psoas  muscle"" and is recommending cortisone injections. 
Can any fellow hippies with similar prolonged post op groin pain offer any advice or have had these type injections?....and if so has it eased or fixed the problem?

"For those who have had or are waiting to have total hip replacement surgery of both hips (done on separate occasions), I would be grateful if you could please share how long between the surgeries on each side you have experienced or were advised to expect?
Short story, I have fortunately now had my long awaited first hip replacement surgery (right side) done mid-May 2021. All ok with no complications. My consultant previously advised the other side would be done after 6 weeks. I had my 8 week post-op check up for right hip in mid-july all ok. Was told then it would be a 3 month wait (from date of first surgery) to have the other side done. Now I'm told that was wrong and is 3 months from the mid-july date.
So now expecting 5 months wait in between surgeries. I am wondering how common this length of wait may be.

"Hi,
This is a strange one but somebody may have heard of a similar case. I had a total hip replacement in early Dec last year. It went well and was a complete success. During my time in hospital I noticed a piece of hard round skin, about the size of a 5p piece. I mentioned it but nobody was unduly concerned. This was on my left hand side, lower inner calf, on the same side as the hip replacement.
As time went on the back of my leg was covered in a very angry rash. The iitching and burning was like nothing I've ever come across before. It then spread to the back of my other leg and is now on the back of my other arm. I have seen every Dermatologist in the hospital and have had countless blood tests, a chest x ray, a Doppler test. I've been on steroids (6 a day for 2 months), antibiotics, steroid creams, pain killers. Ictho paste bandages. At the moment three of my limbs are covered in tubi grips. I have had two biopsies which didn't really show much. I've lost count of all the appointments I've had. At night I'm on Gabopentin to take away the pain so I can sleep. Nobody has seen spots like it or knows what it is. On my left leg it had a blue tinge on top of the rash, very attractive! Months later it's still there, albeit faded...
I really am at the end of my tether. I know this started when I was in hospital as I've always had good skin which heals quickly. I've always told them about the connection but it's been played down. My next stage is to have patch tests, including testing for cleaning materials but also checking for components within my new hip such as metal (my hip is a ceramic one but apparently is held in place with metal). I have involved the hospital where I had my hip replaced (a private hospital but I had it through the NHS). Finally they are listening to what I've said all along... I'm wondering if, worse case scenario. I am allergic to the hip. Would that one need to come out and what would it be replaced with? I just want this nightmare to end, the hip replacement was a walk in the park compared to this.... Can anybody advise me please, I haven't changed anything in this time such as washing powder, foods I eat etc,,,,  Do you know anybody else it's happened to? I'm now in my 9th month and really want them to give me some answers... Thank you.

"I had total left hip replacement on November 23 so about 7 1/2 weeks ago.  I had to wait 4 weeks to go to physical therapy.  I've been going for a couple of weeks now 2 times a week.  I am just not getting any better at all.  Every day I wake up with extremely stiff and painful muscles and I can barely move.  I feel like I will either have to get a wheelchair or be on crutches for the rest of my life.  It didn't help that I could not do much for exercise or even walk much before the surgery because of the severe pain in the left hip.  My muscles are so tight and so stiff.  On top of it, I have to complete a 4-week clinical to finish my medical lab technician program, and that starts April 10.  I have almost given up hope that I will be able to do it.  Is anyone else out there having this problem where their muscles were not in good shape from lack of exercise because of the hip pain and are just not recovering after the surgery?

"I am a 63yo male and had cementless THR in Texas. I had a good to great recovery. After about 14 weeks after THR I was playing 9-holes of golf at a time and walking for 30-40 minutes at a time. I was also climbing 5 flights of stair regularly. My hip after 4-5 months was feeling great and I was very satisfied. I took it slow as my back was giving me problems (another story - likely due to not being able to stretch after thr), but after about 2 months of easing into it, we had a long holiday weekend so we played golf several days in a row. That caused my hip (actually the upper thigh right below the hip) to ache. I rested it for a few weeks following the doctor's advice (if it hurts, stop), and tried to get more active, it still hurt. I had an appointment with the doctor in 6 weeks so I said I will rest it until that appointment.Note that ""resting"" is normal activity and limited walking - similar to the post op recovery guidance.
Now the pain is still at the upper thigh and I have developed pain just above the mid-thigh. All of the pain is deep - not muscular.
I've had x-rays and a detailed MRI but they can't see anything unusual. They suspect ""micro-movements"".
I have rested it now for about 10 weeks and it still hasn't gotten better. I had a few good days so got a little more active (nothing extreme and it was all in the pool) and the next day I could hardly walk.
Any comments would be appreciated. I am thinking of using crutches for a while.

"I had a right THR six week ago and now I'm noticing a catching/popping sensation down the thigh when I walk.
If I place my palm over my thigh near the incision area and begin walking it feels like a muscle or a tendon is catching and popping as I take steps. I mentioned this to the surgeon but he says it's likely to be iliotibial band and it should correct itself in time.
It's left me feeling quite anxious. I've read that some people who reported similar issues had to undergo further surgery to correct a muscle/tendon impingement where the cup of the hip implant is rubbing and causing pain.
I'm not getting any pain but just conscious that something doesn't feel smooth with the new hip. I'm trying to ignore it, telling myself it's early days and there is probably a lot a healing still to go but I can't put my mind at rest and it's causing a lot of worry.
The hip was replaced using the posterior approach. I'm using one crutch for the next four weeks then the surgeon says I should be able to walk without any aids.

Went back to surgeon who after every test imaginative, he actually said ""I can't figure out what's wrong"". i was SHOCKED to say the least! Met with another surgeon that determined the replacement ball had shifted and was too far forward. The surgeon believes the ball shifted b/c it was not screwed in. I had the revision at the end of March 2021. I was so excited b/c I had less pain the day after surgery than I had going into it. Everything was going well. I was ahead of the game with PT, walking normal again and mentally started feeling good. The first week of June I had COVID and was down for 2 weeks. The week after my PT was on vaca for a week. I returned to PT after being out for three weeks and it has been MISERABLE!!!

"My doctor told me I needed THR because of arthritis. At first I was ok with it because
I trust him, he did my surgery for tibial plateau fracture 2 years ago. I have very thin
strong bones. Never break anything when I take bad falls. I had a tibial plateau fracture
because a 140 pound dog ran into the side of my leg.
I worry my pelvis is not strong enough for THR. I worry my femur could break which
I would find devestating.
But my biggest worry is sleeping after the surgery. I cannot get to sleep on my back.
I cant sleep with my legs out straight. I cant sleep with pillows between my legs. If
I eventually fall asleep in an acceptable position for the hip, as soon as I fall asleep
I will thrash until I can get into a comfortable sleep position which will mean knees
bent high and legs twisted. I know this because during my TPF recovery, I had to wear
my big cast to bed to protect my leg during the bedridden period. For the first 2 weeks
I could not get off my back. I would do nothing but thrash until I could get comfortable
enough to sleep. I finally, in my sleep at first managed to haul the big cast on top of
my good leg. My good leg would be sore in the morning but at least I could get some sleep.
I become almost psychotic when I cant sleep. My husband had trouble sleeping when I
was recovering because he was so afraid I would hurt myself in my efforts to sleep.
So this is a huge worry. I am undecided what to do. I have been doing a lot of reading on
THR recovery and the more I read the more panic-stricken I get when it comes to
sleep. Daytime would not e a problem. I am not afraid of surgery in general.
Also I have a language problem with my doctor. I live in Panama, dont completely trust
the medical system. Having it done in the US is just not an option right now.
Anybody have any ideas?

"I am puzzled: I have been told I have a right hip in very bad condition, with major loss of cartilage; said to be arthritic, with bone on bone apposition and cysts. This has been going on for quite a few years, it seems, as running has become increasingly difficult to impossible (particularly on downgrades and rough trails). I have been told conflicting stories about what to expect from a hip replacement. My (current) physician has told me that a new hip will allow me to do everything I used to do (before the actual replacement recommendation; at that time, he suggested it might come to that). Then, he said 兎xcept running. (Unnerving words, to say the least.) Later, when imaging results indicated said severe damage, he pretty much told me that a hip replacement is a must, and I just might be able to merely jog. This contradicts what one of my running friends told me: to the effect of ""get the replacement.It's a breeze, You will probably be passing all of us up... (I have been told that she got a hip replacement, and she can run.) Hence two people said that hip replacement is a must, but with quite different ramifications. I must say, a hip replacement which would allow me to do everything I could previously do, except running would leave me pretty much no better off than I am right now. Furthermore, I have read that the first hip replacement took place back in the early 1960s, and there have been some 60 years worth of major improvements. If such is the case, how could any physician suggest that a hip replacement in 2021 could possibly be not even good enough for running? Also: I have read about what be on the cutting edge in medical science: that it is possible to regrow joint cartilage More specifically, normal cartilage, and not fibrocartilage. For example, apparently as of August, 2020, such has been determined to be possible at Stanford Medicine. A European group has indicated the same. I think they inject a certain 菟owerful bone building protein. Subsequently, something else is administered to keep the new growth as cartilage, instead of forming into bone material. In the wake of this sort of news, I am increasingly hesitant to consent to a hip replacement. I would rather seek to avoid further damage and hold out for maybe an alternative like this.
I have read a little about how maybe TENS and ultrasound maybe can stimulate cartilage growth. I at least somewhat believe that one or more consumable products can grow cartilage, and if so, such would take a while (I can live with that.) (Glucosamine/chondroiton in large quantities did indeed seem to help a knee issue.) I am giving another product a try; it is still quite early.
The said prognosis my physician has given me has raised these questions: why do I not have any particular pain resulting from ordinary walking, although I often walk somewhat lopsidedly, but not painfully? Why do I have no problem getting out of a chair? Why do I experience no ""grinding"" as a result of bone on bone apposition? I'm thinking, more importantly, I may have other joints which are less than optimal. Although, currently, my knees don't scream at me as one of them did at one time, would it not be better to opt for a more 努hole body approach? In any case, the idea of consenting to a hip replacement smells too much like giving into this option before I am ever allowed to give the alternative half a chance.
Anyone else in a similar situation? I, like many of my running friends are sixtysomethings; one seventysomething and still running. I say, Just Say No to a Hip Replacement if it is suggested that such might not even be good enough for one activity which I consider a vital part of human existence: Running.

"At 65 I'm 8 weeks post op, threw away my sticks after 2 weeks, do all the exercises and taken short walks daily. As said by some, i think I'm over doing it and rushing things, as I'm feeling pain in my but and thigh when I've been doing so well. I'm not seeing my surgeon until 12 week post op. Had no contact from physio since the day i left hospital, day after op. My bugbear is, i was told I'd be better for it after a THR but after reading many of your posts, it sounds like l will always have to be careful for years to come. I'm a rambler and worried that i may never get back to hill walking like i did before. wishing i had left well alone now. My pain before the op was after activities and after resting, very stiff and pain. I could walk miles. i took prescription pain killers but don't want to have to take them after the op. any ramblers out there after THR? would love to hear how you are doing.

"Hi, i had a THR in Oct 20, (mid lockdown,great fun). Im nearly 7mths out and thankfully im healing well, not much issues with the hip to be honest. However, i have a big problem with the calf muscle on my operated leg (left). I started walking reasonably normally after around 12wks but very quickly developed muscle problems in my calf. I had around 3wks physio treatment which cleared it up for about a fortnight but then it came back, only much worse ! Loads more physio treatment hasnt helped at all. My physio has referred me to a Consultant who arranged an MRI scan last wk but wont get results for another few days. So, im wondering if any other THR veterans have experienced anything similar? In my opinion there has to be a link ! I played semi pro football for many years and had a couple of calf pulls which only took a couple of weeks to heal. After almost 2 years of increasingly agonising pain in my hip I was sooo looking forward to long pain free family walks with our dog but this is just dragging it out seemingly forever ! If anyone has had similar problems, or has heard of anything like this please let know ! Thanks in advance !

"i had a THR 5 years ago, during which my femur fractured. Six months later the femur shattered and had to be completely replaced with titanium. I did fairly well with extensive therapy, but then my hip began giving me a lot of trouble. After many x-rays and scans, it was determined that I had a detached muscle. Then my knee began buckling and i was put in a brace to stabilize it. Now I have an acquired club foot which I am having surgery to correct that was caused by apparent nerve damage caused by the femur replacement or the hip replacement. Any ideas on how well this situation might turn out?

"Hello Hippies!  I had surgery to replace my left hip two weeks ago today.  I am so pleased to say I am walking without the walker (although too soon to ditch it, much as I'd like to) and am thrilled after 4 months of conservative treatment I am now able to walk again.  However, maybe I did too much my first day, yesterday, but I am having a lot of swelling in my left ankle.  Is this likely to go away with time, or do I need to go back to the surgeon and ask him to see what's going on with my ankle?  Thank you all, this forum has helped me through some dark days, and am happy to say I am recuperating nicely.  Janet

"I have had a THR on both hips. The most recent one was done in 2017, which dislocated at beginning of May.
Knew that there would always be a risk of a dislocation, but after 4 years it was a shock. I always thought it would happen following a fall. In my case, it was from working in the garden using a kneeler and then attempting to get up.
Getting the run around by healthcare professionals, as physical therapy booklet says up to GP to make decision about driving etc, but GP says it is up to physiotherapists.

"I had my right THR on 18th February and was scheduled for my left THR next week, on 27th May. After my first op I was anaemic and was given a blood transfusion and discharged with iron tablets. I couldn't tolerate the tablets so ordered a liquid iron supplement which I took every day. I discussed this with the GP on the phone. I had to go back to the GP surgery 6 to 8 weeks after the op for a further blood test to check the levels again, which I did. When I phoned for the results I was told they were ""within normal limits, no further action required"". I tapered off the liquid iron and stopped taking it. It had also upset my stomach and I thought there was no need to continue with it as I was ok.
I had my pre-op for the op due on 27th last week and the blood test results show that I am anaemic again and I have been told that my op has be postponed for at least 6 weeks. I may have to have an iron infusion. I was obv really disappointed and also surprised because of the results of GP surgery test. To cut a very long story short and after several phone calls it transpires that the results of the GP test were not normal - my blood count was 110. When I went for the first op I was 120 (low end of normal) and when I was discharged I was 78. So the liquid iron had helped. I so wish I hadn't stopped taking the iron. The GP doesn't accept responsibilty yet and as said that my local blood laboratories accept 110 as normal. This is despite all the online information which shows 120 as the acceptable low end of normal for women and despite the fact that to have orthopaedic surgery you need to be at least 120. I am still pursuing this but I am not going to get my surgery for a while and my plans have gone awry.
Sorry for the long post, needed to get this 'off my chest'.

"I had my hip replaced a few months ago. As far as I can tell everything has been fine and I just finished PT. During recovery, I think I was admitted to a different hospital room. The surgeon visited me in recovery and told me that they ""had a hard time reviving me"", that I was ""un-corporative"" and had a ""reaction"" to the anesthesia. He told me that if I had surgery in the future I should let doctors know this. This was also told to my wife when she called the hospital. At that time, they confirmed that I didn't do anything violent or anything like that, but such things I guess can sometimes happen. They told her know as well, that if I had surgery in the future I should let them know that I had a reaction to the anesthesia
After surgery, I have inquired with the surgeon on what this was. Their office referred me to the anesthesia group. The doctor I spoke to there said their is no mention of any of this in my medical records. They simply have tried to reassure me that I was fine and that there was nothing to worry about.
The last thing I remember before the surgery was leaning forward and getting the spinal injection. After that, I remember nothing. Should I have remembered something? I was not under general anesthesia?
I had flashes of awareness when I was being ""revived"" - whatever that means. Being cold. Shaking. There were nurses around me. I remember periods where I was quoting scripture for some reason. I am a Christian, so certainly not ashamed of that. I remember them taking my temperature. It was slightly high. They asked me if I had feeling in my toes at one point. I was going in an out of awareness I think. Sometime after that they moved me to another room. Is this common? Why is none of this in my medical records?
I'm a little concerned that there might be a lack of transparency here, or just a failure to adequately document stuff. I was going to see if I could discern anything from insurance billing codes on the invoices. Is what I described something that could typically happen with spinal anesthesia?
Thanks,

"I had a THR in July 2015, and have never yet been able to walk without a limp/pain. I had no limp pre-surgery. My previous thread was titled ""22 weeks post-op, still can't walk unaided..."". 
My orthopedic surgeon has been unable or unwilling to figure out what is wrong, or to even admit that there is a serious problem. He sent me to a physiatrist who ordered a lumbar MRI (no problem found) and did a sacroiliac joint steroid injection (no improvement). Went back to orthopedist and he ordered an MRI, which I had to push him to do, and the radiologist's report said there was a mild strain in the gluteus medius. I told the ortho that I thought I had an actual tear in my gluteus medius or gluteus minimus, and asked about surgery. He says surgery is never done for that. He said to take prednisone and go back to PT to strengthen the weakness in my hip/thigh.
I was unhappy with this, as I know that there is something wrong. More exercise only makes it worse. If it were a mild problem, it would have corrected itself by now. I do walk a fair amount, considering that I use a crutch or walker, and my healthy leg muscles are in good shape. I did a lot of online research about what my problem could be and to find a new doctor.
I saw a new orthopedist yesterday, one who has pioneered methods of gluteal tendon surgical repair. He ordered a bone scan, to rule out prosthesis loosening and infection, and another, better MRI. Again, the radiologist who read the MRI didn't see much, but the orthopedist looked at the scans and DID see evidence of a tear in the gluteus minimus. He says a ""tear"" is the same thing as ""non-healing"". The gluteus minimus and medius have to be separated during surgery in order to do the anteriolateral approach that was used on me.
The new doc says that my tear won't get better on its own. It requires surgical repair. He is also wondering if the positioning of my prosthesis might have prevented the healing of the muscle/tendon. So he is sending me to a revision specialist for a consult to see whether he thinks a revision is necessary to reposition things. I see him on Tuesday.
Steeling myself for further surgery. I am tired of being debilitated for 7 months now. Plus I have had a rotten head cold/sinusitis for the past 3ｽ weeks that has me really down. I had two orthopedist appointments on my birthday, while really sick with this cold, hardly able to speak. I hope I won't need a revision in addition to the tendon repair. Will know soon. Sigh.
Main takeaway: keep pushing for answers if something is wrong.

"After surgery, my surgeon told me that he had made the right side slightly longer than the lest side, but that I shouldn't worry because he'd sort it out when he does the other side. I accepted that and that was the end. Today though, which is the first day I took a few steps without my crutches, I can really feel a big difference in the length of my legs. It also feels when I put all my weight on the right side to move the left foot forward, that the hip is going to snap where the replacement was done. Is that normal? Perhaps I should just carry on using my crutches to walk? I'm really concerned. Look forward to any advice you might be able to offer me. Thank you.

"my wife was born with hip dysplasia but was not diagnosed until her 22nd birthday. you see we were born in a small community in nl where there was only family doctors. they kept telling her she had growing pains and suffered in much pain her younger life. at 22 we moved to ontario canada where she properly diagnosed. because now of her age she was given corrective surgery but as an adult she was warned that her relief would last for at least 10 to 15 years but would given a complete replacement before that time would come. it never. over the past several decades doctors were only performing hip replacements on older people and was only 27 years old. she was told she is too young and she would only wear it out to quickly. she wanted to go back to work, contribute to society with her college degree but no how many doctors she seen, she was given excuse after excuse. they just put her a high dosage of narcotics for 30 years. 360mg of oxycodone a day. she finally got to see one of the best orthopetic surgen in canada. he stated that she can no longer be a candidate because has been eaten away with arthritis and theres nothing left of bone and carthlitch for a hip to fuse to. she now cant support her own weight and is bed ridden 6 days a week. there are some days, good days where she can use her cane to leave her room but only for short periods as this has caused new severe pain and bulged disc in her upper neck making her paralysis in her upper right body. my wife is a strong woman both mentally and spiritally strong and never ever asked for pity but were now grasping at straws and was wondering if there was such a thing about hip replacements from condavors.

"My medical history is somewhat complex. At 23 I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, and I had a brain hemorrhage which paralysed my right leg. I suffered from seizures for a while until I started treating them with Keppra.
Apparently the steroids I had to take for leukemia prevention caused a complication. It's suspected that it caused avascular necrosis of my femoral head of my LEFT leg. My right leg was the one that got paralysed, until now my left leg was my good leg. I complained about pain often but my doctors didn't take it seriously because they just assumed I was overcompensating with it. I've been in some amount of pain for about a year and a half. It still doesn't hurt too much, I can walk on it but my doctor said that if I continue to do so, it will eventually collapse.
I got an MRI after an xray to make sure of the results. He told me I'm currently in stage 1-2 out of 4 of AVN. He proposed the idea of a vascularized fibular graft to try and heal the bone and get things back to normal. He told me that he doesn't encounter AVN too often as he's sort of a small-town doctor and recommended I speak to someone else.
I spoke with a surgeon at UCLA (I'm in California) upon recommendation and the surgeon told me that the damage was too intensive and I would require a full hip replacement. He said that a vascularized fibula graft or a core decompression surgery were ""very unlikely"" to fix the problem.
This is really discouraging, and I'm really reluctant to get a full replacement done since, apparently I still don't have a collapsed bone. I'm in the process of getting second opinions but I feel scared. I know I can live a normal life 20 years after I get a replacement, but what about after that? Assuming I'm optimistic and living to be 90-100, I'm looking at 4 more replacement surgeries in a BEST case scenario. That's not even including the chance that something could go wrong at any given point aside from regular wear-and-tear.
And yeah, I know technology might improve, but it's still very taxing to have intense surgery like this done on you at any point, especially on the hips since it's my understanding that the bones eventually wear away and each subsequent surgery gets more difficult and complicated.
Any advice?

"I am 52 years old. I love to downhill ski, water ski, hike, climb 14ers (Colorado), play pickleball, etc. I had my labrum repaired 6 months ago. The MD told me I was not a candidate for a hip replacement as I was too young. I went back for my 6 month post op visit and it turns out, after 6 months of ""recovery"" and about $8000 out of pocket, I am bone on bone and require a hip replacement. What a difference 6 months in age can make...needless to say, this MD does not do hip replacements, only labral repair or reconstruction. My questions:
Will I ever be able to do any of the things I've listed again?
Has anyone else experienced something similar within 6 months of them being told they were not a candidate?
Do you think this was negligence? I paid him $2500 for stem cells and $2500 for capsular closure. I feel he shouldn't have done those things based on knowing how bad my cartilage looked when he got in there.
I am CRUSHED by the news of a hip replacement as I wanted to the fun grandma who did lots of things like skiing, etc with her grandkids (my kids are only 16 and 17).

"Hi,
My 92 year old grandmother fell 2 weeks ago and needed hip surgery which consisted of inserting two pins and a plate in her right hip. Unfortunately she is in too much pain and is not able to try and walk meaning she is at risk of becoming bed ridden soon. She only has one kidney as the other one is dry so the amount of pain killers she can be given is very limited which is why she is in so much pain and is unable to try and walk. Is there any time frame of when the pain will start to decrease maybe? She is in so much agony and she seems to have given up completely and it's so heartbreaking to see her like this! A decrease in the amount of pain is the only hope for her to come out of this situation so she is desperate.

"So here is my story.
I am 37, and was an active person until June of last year. I had a D&C and woke up in an obscene amount of pain and it was dismissed as cramps. Finally after not giving up on one doctor telling me it was all in my head and one doctor who refused to give up on me - I was diagnosed 4 months later with a labral tear of my left hip. In December of last year I had a hip arthroscopy. I followed my doctors orders to a t and was still in an insane amount of pain. I was sent to a neurologist and then a pain management doctor. After two failed injections in my spine, the doctor asked me to see an orthopedic to satisfy his curiosity.
Another MRI later and I have been diagnosed with another labral tear in the same hip! The original doctor who did my surgery is no longer covered under my insurance so I cannot go back to him.
Apparently the surgeon today said he did impeccable work.
So here I sit, after a year of unending pain wondering if this has happened to anyone else or am I all alone?
I can't help but to feel a little defeated. Anyone can handle pain if you know when it's going to stop but a year of this has taken its toll. Please help!!

"On 2/9 I had right THR. within one hour post op, they did a second surgery because the ball joint was the wrong size.......within 20 minutes of that surgery, they gave me general anasthesia to fix the dislocation caused by staff as I never came out of recovery. 4 nights in hospital. 8 days later I took an ambulance ride to ER AT 1am as I woke up with what the doctor said was ""the worst dislocation he has ever seen"". 7 days, back to hospital dislocated and followed by surgery number 3 to replace the cup and insert a screw. ok, I am 4 weeks post op from surgery #3 and can hardly walk still. I have constant pain in my whole leg and my toes are numb. It goes without saying I am the beneficiary of a bad experience. I am healthy and a perfect candidate for a great outcome until this. I have searched tirelessly for any info to help me understand what my surgeon can not and I am starting to feel like i am the first and alone. my question...has anyone experienced anything like this and if so, how long before you were ""normal?"" I walked 7 miles the day before my surgery and now I fear I will never hike like that again. PLEASE do not let my misfortune keep you from getting a new hip.

"Hello all,
Last October after receiving encouragement on this site, I decided to go ahead with a hip replacement. I had already seen a surgeon who suggested I try physio but it didn't help that much, after which I joined this site for advice. One of the things that was mentioned was that I could change my surgeon, and after some research I found someone with more experience than the consultant I'd seen, and so I asked the hospital if I could change to him. Unfortunately the paperwork was messed up (I love the NHS but...) and finally this was agreed in December.
I was due a phone consultation with the new surgeon (due to Covid) in January which was then rescheduled for February. Then rescheduled again for April. And now I've just received a letter saying it's been put back again until July. And this is just the initial consultation! It's so frustrating because I had my initial consultation with the original surgeon in early 2020, it was only my lack of decision making and then changing the surgeon that has brought about all these delays. It's looking less and less likely that I'm going to be able to have the op this year.
I'm considering going private but this would clear me out financially, but is do-able, just. My main worry about this is what happens if things go wrong post op? It looks like 13-15 grand for the op, and you only get one follow up consultation! If I have post op issues, do I have to then pay more (which I won't be able to afford) or will I have to go on an NHS list and potentially wait months and months to be seen?
Any advice on what I could do to speed up the NHS route? I'm very aware that in this age of Covid then I'm lucky at all to be seen, but I do feel that I could have been seen much earlier if I hadn't changed my surgeon, I'm wondering if there's some way I could get an appointment sooner with an alternative surgeon, or somehow expedite my operation.
Thanks in advance.

"Hi all, I had my THR 4 weeks ago now and I can walk fine with 1 crutch but i'm having troube walking without as my leg feels so week and slightly shorter than my unoperated leg.
My surgeon said that he managed to get both legs the same length as I had quite a lot of difference before my op but they are still slightly uneven ( I think ) and I'm worried that this is why I cant walk.
Other than this I'm doing well and haven't had any pain meds for about 2 weeks.
Has anyone else had their operated leg lenthened and how did it work out?

Second question: There are so many negative stories on this forum of sub par recovery, its got me worried! Overall I was under the impression that Hip replacement is one of the most successful operations. It does not sound this way from reading the forum.

"Hi.
I broke my hip over a period of a year (a slow break) at the head of the femur and in June 2019 I had a metal plate and a dynamic hip screw put in.
Then I ended up at the rehabilitation facility for 10 weeks and wasn't doing too badly but unfortunately after I was discharged during my recovery I suffered a broken rib (caused by travelling in transport with very poor suspension whilst being transported for dialysis)
So beginning of March 2020 I was admitted to hospital and was there for a month just laid on a bed, all physio stopped and I got out beginning of April but unfortunately covid happened and my appointment with the consultant at Doncaster Royal infirmary was cancelled indefinitely as was a planned hip replacement.
The reason for the planned hip replacement was because the dynamic hip screw, more specifically the metal plate, some of the screws were coming out of the bone but as I said covid happened and anything other than life threatening injuries all surgery was cancelled.
Now I've finally been seen today but by a different consultant and he's told me after looking at the xray taken today that the metalwork in his words has 'collapsed' and also that the hip hasn't healed, which I'm struggling to believe purely because when I was seen February 2020 I was told that it had, now I'm told that it hasn't which seems very strange.
All I've been doing is laid on a bed 24/7 for the last year so I'm unsure how the metalwork has collapsed as well because I've not put any weight on it.
Also he discussed the hip replacement and his main reason for not doing it was because I could get an infection also that it may not work because I have weak bones due to kidney failure and associated conditions but surely taking the metalwork out there's a risk of infection as well?
The thing is I'm absolutely determined to walk again and I have no issues with my right hip or leg (so far) and I'm struggling to accept that my left hip hasn't healed even if it's only partially healed, because I was told without a doubt that my rib would never heal but it DID!! Here's the thing I haven't seen the xray and I think because I was told my rib wouldn't heal and it did that I've been told my hip hasn't healed but the previous consultant said it had so I'm struggling to believe it hasn't.
Also the reason being given about risk of infection, they're wanting to admit me next Thursday to take out the metal work and see what's what, whatever that means.
My main question is, is there anyone on here with weak bones successfully had a hip replacement and learnt to walk again?? Please reply to this if you have.
Because I'm massively determined to walk again and I'll do anything., I have 2 children that I need to recover for.
I look forward to your replies.
Thank you.

"I had my first hip replacement in December last year on my right hip, and quite quickly within a few months (or less) my left hip started to hurt so much, the pain was terrible! I felt so completely disheartened to think I would now need the second one done.
Although xrays show my left hip is very far from perfect, I really did not want to have another THR (I am 41) so soon. This message is to those whom are in the same position.
Now I am nine months on, my left hip pain has decreased significantly and is not too bad, so for anyone not wanting to rush into a second hip replacement, it might be worth giving it a few months to settle down. I think the strain of the first hip replacement on your other hip is huge.
Having said that if the pain is unbearable and you are suffering, there is no point to wait, as we all know the pain doesn't get better, but for those with moderate to mildly severe, it has been worth waiting for me, I am hoping to give it a good few years before undertaking my next one now, as I can definitely live with the left one as it stands now.

On a serious note, I wanted to share my experience with you - it may be reassuring to you if you have the same kind of pain in your other hip.

"its over 6 months since my right total hip replacement. Things were going quite well with odd twinges which I put down to muscle healing etc. but now for the past few weeks I am getting more pain than pre op. My right lower back aches most of the time and although I have been managing walks of over 2 miles (sometimes 4 with rest stops) I find I get pain with each step. I have tried using walking poles or a stick but to no avail. It also hurts if I stand for more than 5 minutes. I am also having pain at the front of my thigh on and off (which I thought might be muscular) and now find lying on my operated side painful ( which I wasnt experiencing after 8 weeks post surgery. I have tried ibuprofen gel and tablets, painkillers and hot wheatie bag but things seem to be getting worse. It is getting me down as my husband recently had a heart procedure and needs to exercise and I am holding him back whereas prior to this ( in December ) 3 months post op I managed my first 10000 steps a day without discomfort.
i also find on getting up from a chair (even a high one) I get thigh pain for a few minutes as I weight bear. has anyone else experienced this and could offer advice?

"I had a THR a week ago but it dislocated soon after surgery, somewhere between the operating theatre to my hospital bed and went unnoticed until the following day, after a night of agony. As soon as the spinal had worn off after surgery I was in a lot of pain and couldn't move. So it's highly unlikely I caused it. I could not get any answers as to why it happened, what caused it and how it could have gone unnoticed by the healthcare team and RMO all night. The next day the physio noticed one leg shorter than the other, and promptly ordered an x-ray. I underwent a MUA, which was successful and my recovery took off. The surgeon is experienced in THR, and I put my trust in him. I was made aware of all the risks involved, and that it might not be plain sailing, but what happened to me haunts me. If I can help prevent someone else experiencing this, I will. My question is this. Because of the dislocation I have been told to wear a cricket splint on my leg for 6 weeks. I'm only a week in and it's a hindrance. I can't see any benefit in it. The physio said it will help prevent my hip dislocating by keeping my leg straight, but since I have removed it, just for a while, I am moving around better. I wonder if a hip splint is really what I need, (if anything), after a THR MAU? The splint hinders my exercises (I can't bend my knee), it will not stay in place regardless of the strong velcro strapping, and it constantly slips down my leg, so its efficacy is questionable anyway. My husband makes it fit as best he can, but it still slips down (the physio had the same problem) and I wondered if anyone else has been through this? At night I'm lying on my back as instructed with my operated leg immobilised by the splint. But if I have to endure wearing it, I need to know it's beneficial.

"Hi
I'm 3wks post op. and this time the experience was different from last one over 12 months ago.
Even get up without thinking about it, get in bed without thinking about it... and its worrying me a little that i forget.
I've been told as this hip had hip dysplasia, that i have to use crutches for 12 wks too, and i do if i go out for a walk or shopping to supermarket, but round house use 1 or none, but hard thinking that i have to use crutches fully for another 9 weeks, but at least in 3wks time i can speak with my consultant about this.
i can lift my leg at the calf in bed, Which last time took over 6mth to do, i can move it easily side ways, still in with my precautions. Im going back to work monday, and in all honesty don't even give it much thought. should i be worried or has this happened to anyone else as on here we mainly see problems not progress stories...

"Hi I have so many questions which I should of asked but you don't know what you need to know until you need to know it , if that makes sense.
I'm day 11 post THR and decided I could do a little bit more around the house. I ironed for about 20 mins making sure not to bend , filled and emptied the washing machine (using my grabber which I'm finding invaluable ) and now feel absolutely exhausted. My operated foot is puffed up so I'm now resting it. Is this too soon.
What time span do you think I should give.
Also I haven't braved a shower yet as it's over the bath. I think I could lift my leg over from behind if I used a small step. I won't do this alone though. How long did you take to do this.
Sorry for all the questions but after care is not very good to say the least. I was never advised about these things. I know everyone will be different but just trying to get an idea.
Thanks

"hi, I've been having god awful groin pain on my left side since May 2020, after a couple of weeks it spread into my right side. my gp originally thought groin strain and sent me to a physiotherapist in August 2020 who also agreed that I'd pulled all my groin muscles and gave me some exercises to do. within 2 days of doing the exercises which were squeezing a ball between my thighs 5 times, 5 times a day and laying in the recovery position and lifting the leg that was straight and I was lying on into the air and holding it there for 5 seconds whilst lying on my side, 5 times, 5 times a day I started to get constant twitching in my toes. I mean like every 3 seconds moving my toes on both feet in all directions! my gp sent me to a neurologist who did some tests, a full spine and brain mri and ncs/emg on the nerves in my right leg and foot. all tests came back clear apart from the pelvis xray he sent me for because he felt my problem was Musculoskeletal. the xray found acetabular retroversion on my left hip. I believe the physio made my hips 10 times worse and now the twitching in my feet is still there but I'm also getting constant buzzing down both legs, my right leg is worse. today it feels like my right calf is numb, like someone squeezing it. my feet feel like they have electrical waves running through them and I've been like this for months now its so distressing I can't stand it. my left groin feels so sore and swollen deep inside and I can't move that leg around as much , the pain follows the crease of my leg down to around my buttocks. I have sharp pain when going from sitting to standing in both sides of my groin. sorry for the long post but my question is had anyone had these awful constant buzzing and twitching and pains down there legs from problems with there hips before? if it wasn't for my 2 children I wouldn't be here now, I cant sleep or even relax and watch tele and I feel like no doctor wants to help me.

"As you all know, we're told to sleep on our back for 6 weeks, exception being it's apparently OK after a week or two to sleep on the damaged side with a pillow between ones legs. I've always been a right side sleeper.
Well, I tried the side one and it is too painful still. I am 3 weeks out from a left THR. If I sleep on my back I sometimes try it with a pillow under my knees as suggested by the physio. This doesn't help, in fact it makes the back pain worse sometimes.
I wake up stiff and aching from back and pelvis and barely able to move. It eases as I get up and move around.
Anyone any advice at all please about alleviating this? I have another three weeks to go before I can right side sleep and even then need to be careful!

"Hi everyone,
Long post, do bear with.
I was on here much earlier in the year in a blind panic about potentially needing a THR. I remember a great number of you being incredibly kind and patient with me, so thank you for that. It meant a huge amount.
I have Bi Lateral Type I (mild) DDH which has led to stage IV arthritis in my right hip, my left is fine for now (minor wear and tear). I played football for years and Im right footed, which potentially accelerated it, its also at more of an angle than the left. I am 37 and only found out I had this condition five years ago. I had a very unsatisfactory appointment with a Consultant back in January where I was signed up for surgery with little discussion (I went in for a check up as my walking had deterioated). I asked for another appointment, was given one in March but due to COVID it didnt happen until September. When I attended in September (husband and three pages of questions in tow) the Consultant actually offered me surgery the next month as Id made it to the top of the waiting list. However, after we'd gone through my questions and he'd assessed my pain levels and seen the improvements I'd made with the physio I'd been seeing since February, we both agreed to move me back to the outpatients list for now. He hasn't discharged me, hes a decent man with a good rep and Im happy for it to be him when its right. He said to just email his secretary if anything changed and he'd pop me back on the list.
I thought I'd feel much more resolved than this, but I don't. I feel terribly depressed and lost. I'm scared I gave up an opportunity that might be years away now as I deterioate, and the idea of waiting to get worse feels awful. In a non COVID world Id be more confident about waiting lists, but sadly this is now a huge factor. Equally, I am petrified of the surgery itself, future revisions and potentially being unable to walk when Im retired and should be enjoying myself. Is it all worth a few extra years? Or is it worth it for the peace of mind that I did everything I could first and this was the only option left? I just dont know.
At present, my pain is low. I can walk a couple of miles still (more if I take my crutch). Walking is hard, it takes effort and I ache for a little while afterwards. I do two hours of physio daily. I dont take any pain meds. My ROM is poor but I can do everything (touch the floor, shoes/socks, etc). My consultant seemed to think 15 years was about right for the first replacement, 10 years or so for riskier and less effective revisions which seems a little bleak (I'd always imagined myself as a fit and busy 60-something one day!) My physio thinks Im doing great and also supports ""not yet."" I must admit to less pain and more ROM through physio (I also do twice weekly pilates).
However, saying that, being restricted gets me down. I plan everything around how far I need to walk. I feel much older than I am and like Im trapped in a broken body. Lockdown hasnt helped where the only available activity is walking, which is hard work and not pleasurable. I keep fit on a home cross trainer. The consultant also wasnt sure if my pain was bone or muscle, or whether the muscle pain would resolve or ROM would improve post op, which again - bleak. Seems like a big op for a lot of ""not sures."" I just feel completely unsure of my next move and cant seem to settle my head at all. I found people on here much more balanced (I was referred to as an ""idiot"" on another forum for not taking the September date when I was so unsure).
So - what I'd love to hear are outcomes I suppose, especially around revisions. If anyone was more hesitant and waited, was this ok or a regret? Im worried waiting too long might affect the outcome, although the consultant seemed confident than any further deterioation now would be slow.
I don't think I ever thought I'd say this, but I wish I was older and revisions werent so much of an issue! I also wish COVID and the impact on waiting lists weren't such a factor.
Thank you for reading...

"I have just come out of hospital after having a THR.
On the day of my admission to hospital last week (Thursday 21st Jan), I weighed 68 kgs. The following morning after my discharge (Tuesday 26th Jan) I weighed 73 kgs. In five days that is almost impossible to go up 5kgs.
Of the days I was in hospital I fasted just short of 24 hours, then the next day ate very lightly. The meals were delicious but small. I felt they were the correct size for a female in the days following surgery. Mains were in/on a small oval plate or dish. Could order snacks whenever but I didn't because I felt nauseous some of the time. Husband sometimes finished my food.
OK I had IV fluids for two days. I was more confined to bed but did get up to shower the following day, do my exercises, walk the corridor. I did not see anyone else walking the corridors at all, leave alone as much as me.
I don't know how much the prosthesis weighs compared to my discarded bone but I'm sure it is not 5 kgs. I also do not know whether I have some oedema still in my leg or retained fluids from the bags of IV fluid.
What's going on? I am genuinely nonplussed. Any thoughts?

"Hi, wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. I had THR two years ago at the age of 52, it went really well and I recovered very quickly. I have been thrilled with the results. I have been exercising regularly but keeping it low impact.
Then 2 months ago, over a course of a couple of days I suddenly started to get groin pain which radiates to the upper thigh and into the hip and deep into my buttock. I put it down to perhaps 'overdoing it'. In lockdown I have done some long uphill bicycle rides and reckoned that was it.
It didn't improve and started to become more constant and intense (dull throbbing & aching rather than sharp pain or pain under load). I had 6 sessions of physio. The physio said the hip was rotating perfectly and was perplexed.
I managed to see to my hip surgeon after a month. He did an MRI, x-ray and blood tests. The MRI and x-ray results didn't show any structural or muscular issues and the blood tests showed no sign of infection. He was reassured and suggested coming back to see him in a couple of months.
However the pain is getting much worse and I am petrified something serious is wrong (I had root canal treatment and a subsequent extraction after an abscess late last year so think maybe there could be an infection but that's maybe just my anxiety after googling so much).
Just be interested to hear from others who have experienced anything similar and how they have got to a diagnosis when test results don't show any issues but you know something is not right.
Thanks so much.

I know that we all heal differently so I have tried to give some background.
 I am coming up to 12 week post RTHR posterior with no cement or screws.  I had physio and hydrotherapy until 9 weeks and continue to exercise. I did very well for several weeks, had little pain and was signed off by the surgeon at week 7.  I have almost all of my range of movement back but still have pain down the back of my thigh and still have some difficultly with exercises weight bearing on my operated leg and lifting / moving  my other leg to to the side .  The consultant said that there were some more muscles needing to fully heal and he expected that I would be able to walk with out a crutch in another couple of weeks. This has not happened and I am still in some pain after walking a few yards unaided.  I can walk about a mile with my stick and then I tire.  However, I have lower spine problems and I know that this hinders me and I have been told that it will continue to be an issue. 
 Another query is that  the consultant said that at 12 weeks I could stop the restrictions and do anything I feel comfortable with and can manage including breast stroke. In fact he recommended swimming to me. However, I am concerned and I may have to learn to do another stroke!!!  I am still extremely nervous about dislocation  - your advice would be greatly appreciated. 
 In summary I have three queries:
Should I be able to walk unaided now? Should I get further advice or is it just time?
Do any of you do breast stroke regularly?
What precautions do people take after 12 weeks? 
Thank you!

"I had a THR on my right hip 11 weeks ago.
The first few weeks were tough but totally pain free, which is amazing.
My right leg and ankle started to swell but I was told at my 2 week assessment that it is to be expected.
9 weeks later, although not as swollen, my lower leg is very pink and blotchy and the skin is extremely tight, sore and tender to the touch. My husband moisturises it for me every other night, as I can't reach down to it. Also as I do my ankle rotations I sense what I can only describe as an 'electric shock' shoot down the nerves at the inside of my foot. It's like what happened sometimes down the nerves when I had acupuncture for back pain. It isn't painful but quite uncomfortable. It definitely isn't right.
Had anyone else experienced this?
If so, does it fade with time?
Do I need to ask my GP about it?
Thank you.

"i have had some sort of hip pain for eight years now . December 2019 I had hip arrhoscopic surgery which consisted of labrum tear, hip impingent correction, measured rhe arthriris in my hip, etc.
Still had to have a full hip replacememt December 2020 bc the arthritis over doubled in size. Weird when i have not even exercised or could not even walk a mile in pain.
I still have glute minimus and medius partial thickening and tears, tendonopathy and piriforus pain. i could be walking without a cane rigjt now if it werent for the piriformus pain. I have had piriformus pain since 8 years ago, thats not new but since surgery its worse . I dug into my piriformus with a tennis ball and now hurt my siatic nerve, which i hope is temporary. its hindering my progress .
I am being told when i am six months post op i can get a pressure release injection (something like that) in the piriformis . I have had muscle relaxer for one week which isnt making it go away.
When someones in chronic pain for so long it really messes with your head.
i am discouraged and feel like its never going to get better. And not to forget i have had faccet injections and nerve burning done for that and the SI joint temporary relief . THe frustrating part is the SI joint is considered the spine so i see a different doctor and feel like I am not treated as a whole body only symptoms .
Everyday i have to fight the internal message to not give up.
I have always been a hard worker . I trained hard in the gym as part of my mental therapy. People would always ask what competition i was training for , but it was my hobby and where i cleared my mind. for two years now i havent graced the doors of a gym and cant even walk a mile without tears or pain.
Even in pain i have refinished furniture in three rooms during 2020 covid restrictions and but up board and batton in my entry way and hall. i ended up each day with two ice packs and heating pads Lol but i had to keep working
So, now after hip replacement i was hoping id have some normalcy but feel like this ongoing piriformis pain isnt going to allow me to recover or get better.
All I keep hearing is give it time ... i feel like thats all i have done, and this is just another excuse and Theres no answers or help

"Hello,
In 2016 I had both my hips replaced age 35 due to impingement and unsuccessful debridement. It's a good while on now and both my glutes and right glute in particular are still really hollowed out/wasted. It is causing me huge problems as my gait is off, I can't sit for glute pain or stand for long because my hamstrings are getting totally overloaded. The problem has got worse since I started a new job - I thought and up/down sit/stand desk would help but it just crippling my hamstrings, calf and achilles . I seen physios and try to build things up but whatever I do just seems to aggravate the hell out of my hamstrings where they attach around the inside back of the knee. Has anyone had this chronic glute problem? I'm working from home so I can disguise the fact that I'm basically incapable of working normally. Totally depressed. To be honest, if I didn't have a lovely family I wouldn't be sat here.

"Chronic groin pain 8 months after Anterior right hip replacement has brought me to this board where I am finding what doctors say is very rare that it is indeed not rare but very common.
In reading posts I am finding some commonalities. It seems the anterior approach or super path hip replacement. I don't see a lot of posts about groin pain from posterior approach.
I need your help in gathering feedback. If you have groin pain after hip replacement, please let me know and who the manufacturer is of your implant..Yes the manufacturer of their implant everyone should know..You just don't get an implant without knowing what it is...
For example: I had anterior right hip replacement in FEB 2017, and had Stryker ceramic implants.  The hip implant manufacturers changed their diameters of the femoral head several years ago and I feel that is the cause of alot of groin problems.
IF U.S. I would like to recommend everyone check their doctor out here. This website is part of the Medicare/government site.  unch. It was even more surprising to find all that money came from Stryker...Put your doctors name in search tool, $$ will come up in one tab, the other tab tells you what company paid it.. THis was part of medical transparency act , which is part of Obamacare...Needless to say Stryker ceramic implant was not the best choice for me personally as i have already been told by independent dr. (Sorry i dont know what the sites are for other countries)
Please let me know if you are having groin pain and type of surgery you had.So many people are having this, its shocking!

I had THR 1 week ago. This was done using a posterior, uncemented approach (with titaniuam shaft/ceramic ball/polyethelene cup)
My Dr has said to use crutches for 4 weeks with only 10kg weight-bearing on that hip. Is that normal? I read on lots of forums and other info that full weight-bearing walking should start as soon as not painful (even for uncemented hips) as the best way to rehab.
Thoughts?

my surgery was on my right hip. I was told the surgery would only be 2 to 3 hours.... but my surgery took 7 hours. After they installed my new hip socket they proceeded with the metal ball insertion to the femur. while doing so the surgeon said he had possibly fractured my femur. So they had to take everything including the new socket . They then installed a new socket that would fit the new and longer ball femur part and they had to wire around the top of my femur to hold it all together. To this day my right hip has a lot of pain in the joint and groin...and my left outer thigh is numb. I informed my surgeon of this and he said it has nothing to do with the hip operation

"I last posted 5weeks ago. Long post i'm sorry. I'm hoping someone has had the same problems as me after surgery. I am 13 weeks post THR. My latest appointment with consultant was last Thursday 31st. He x-rayed my hip as physio said I was showing signs the joint had become loose. Thankfully it's not but I still have really discomfort on my new hip area. He thinks I have bursitis/bad inflammation and told me to buy ibuprofen gel to rub on the area. Took me off Naproxen as it's giving me stomach problems. Keep going with the exercises from physio and still walk with one stick outside. He has prescribed Gabapentin which I still don't have yet due to delay at doctors!! I have a follow-up apt in 6 weeks when he said he ""might"" inject cortisone if still the same. This is really dragging me down now as it feels like I am getting no where with my recovery. I know we all recover at different rates and it was a massive operation. I live in Scotland and so far our hospital isn't over-run with covid patients (thankfully) so still seeing outpatients. I was at physio yesterday (8th). She thinks it's also Trochanteric pain being aggravated by the inflammation or busitis. I now have more exercises for this too. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms after thr, i'd appreciate any advice as the pain and lack of sleep is getting me down.
Thanks again for reading.

"Hi - I had a total hip replacement 4 years ago.
I had what seemed to be a random sharp recurring pain in my leg over the years. When the pain occurs, I simultaneously lose some strength in my leg.
I finally was able to figure out that the pain wasn't random. The trigger would be whenever I leaned forward at the waist for an extended period of time, generally with the front of my legs pressing against something.
A good example of a trigger would be when I was standing up while working on a jigsaw puzzle, leaning over the table, with the front of my thighs against the table edge. The next day (and sometimes the same day), the pain would reappear and last for days.
The pain isn't consistent after it has been triggered - I need to twist my leg slightly in certain ways for the pain to occur once it has been triggered. Sometimes, the pain can occur when walking once triggered.
Does anybody know what the root cause could be?
Thanks,
Alan

"Very active 80 year old man. Have had this moderate to severe OA for a while. First treated by Ortho Dr as Bursitis with exercise. Some relief but started getting worse. Prescribed supervised PT with Tylenol. Got worse and gave a local shot in the hip. Just stuck it in. Ne relief. Gave second shot, same way, 2 weeks later with no real results. Did MRI and diagnosed moderate to severe OA. Prescribed Tramadol, as needed, more PT.
Still getting worse.
Moved and got new Hip Dr who gave me computer guided shot. Total relief second day only then back to a somewhat reduced pain all the time. Tramadol and Tylenol give some relief.
Its been 5 days. Should I wait longer before contacting DR and will he give me second shot to try relief?
Probable replacement in the near future.

"I had my right hip replaced 4.5+ years ago and found this forum at that time. I was 57 at the time and am now 62. I still have some residual issues; muscle weakness, scar tissue, leg length discrepancy. But all in all, I do not regret getting the surgery.
My brother is 60 and his left hip was bone on bone with two nasty bone spurs. When he first saw his surgeon, the doctor remarked that my brother must be a ""tough son of a b***h"" to be walking around like that. My brother is a production manager in the food industry and walks miles a day within a facility on concrete floors. He also cycles 100s of miles a month and is in great shape for his age. In fact, he cycled the day before his surgery at his doctor's suggestion!
On November 10, he had his surgery and was released the next day. By November 20, he was walking without a cane, off the heavy meds, driving his car and cycling on his recumbent stationary bike. He is absolutely amazing! All of this to say, if you are holding off on getting your hip replacement done because you are scared of the surgery, JUST DO IT. The change in your quality of life will be life-altering. The sooner you can get back to doing the things you love, the better.

I have never had any sort of issues with my toe no bunions or pain of any kind all I can think is that previous to the op I was walking very badly on my foot could I have done something to it? I知 regularly rubbing muscle cream on it heating and icing but it痴 not eased off.

"I have had two hip replacements one a year ago and the other 11 years ago. I am concerned the one of 11 years may be developing problems .About 2-3 weeks ago it started with a niggle in the groin and has now changed to a deep discomfort over the old surgical site and the very top of back of the thigh.This is particularly bad on weight bearing especially after sitting
while and also a lot of discomfort over the hip on walking . Its quite different from the original pre op pain which was mainly in the groin .
This hip is still reviewed every 3 years and the last x ray 1 year ago was deemed satisfactory by the orthopaedics . They stated on that review they would see me in clinic if I had any problems before next review . I am a bit reticent about going along that route just at the moment but would much appreciate the symptoms and experiences of people who have needed revision surgery after a few years ie pain etc and was it different from the primary pain before the initial surgery.

"Hello everyone, this is my first post here after I found the forums online. Apologies in advance for the long post.
I am 52 and have arthritis in my right hip which has got worse and worse over the last 5 or so years. Walking is quite painful (although this varies quite a lot, sometimes it is just a faint pain, other times it can be very uncomfortable to the point where walking is difficult, but most of the time it's somewhere in between). I now walk with a slight limp.
I had an x-ray and saw an NHS consultant in a London hospital who advised that I will indeed need a hip replacement as the arthritis is quite advanced. However, he told me that since it is not painful when I'm not walking or lying down, then I should use painkillers and try physiotherapy until the pain becomes too much. He added that if I really want to go ahead, he would be happy to do the op. This was 10 months ago and I have worked hard at strengthening the muscles around my hip after seeing two physiotherapists.
However, while this has improved the pain (before physio there were occasions when I actually had to stop in the street due to the pain) it hasn't changed things as much as I'd hoped. Mornings are particularly stiff and when I walk I still have the slight limp and feel varying levels of pain.
I also feel that the bad hip is impacting upon my general health and quality of life. I have lower back pain which I believe is due to my gait as a result of limping (I know there is no guarantee that this would be fixed after an op, but I suspect it would help). I try hard to get exercise walking but I feel I would be more active if I didn't suffer with the pain.
So my question is, how bad do things need to be before going for a total hip replacement? Should I hang on a couple more years, minimising the chance of needing a second op in 15 or so years time? Or should I go ahead while I am relatively young? I'll admit, the operation scares the life out of me (even the idea of sleeping on my back doesn't sound fun as I'm a real turner in bed!) and the message from the consultant and physio seems to be that 'this is a serious operation and you shouldn't do it unless absolutely necessary'.
How did you guys decide whether to go ahead? I hover between wanting to go ahead and thinking maybe it's not so bad and I should wait. It doesn't help that there doesn't seem to be anyone you can talk to in great detail. The doctors are all so busy, you only ever get 10 minutes with them.
Another factor that helps me is that I work in IT, meaning I can work from home during recovery (especially during covid as working from home is becoming the norm). Therefore loss of income is not an issue.
Once again, apologies for the long post, any advice much appreciated.

"I have been listed in January for a THR for the right hip. I have osteoarthritis in both hips with some bone on bone contact. I have had this flare up for about 14 months since I stupidly moved a heavy mattress.
I had a steroid injection in the right hip last December but it wore off very quickly.
On reading the forums here and other forums I am very doubtful that I am bad enough to go through major surgery yet. The pain and lack of mobility I had at first have lessened and now I do not have much pain and when I do it is not severe. I am uncomfortable a lot of the time and I have not been able to sit in an easy chair. I do not take pain killers during the day but at night I take two paracetamol and medication for sleep (Mirtazapine). I sleep well.
Walking was one of my greatest pleasures and I walked every day at least 7000 steps. I belonged to a walking group and did 5 miles regularly. I can walk but not very far and I can only go to places where there are seats so that I can rest. I can walk for about 10 minutes before I need to sit down. A lot of the pleasure has gone.
The hope that I could get back to normal walking is my major impetus for undergoing surgery. I have discussed it to some extent with the consultant surgeon but I suspect he thinks that I am worse than I am now. I am also uncertain and very fearful because of all the risks involved. For example the consultant said that the effect of the surgery would be similar to the best day after the steroid injection. I was a bit surprised and said that although there had been an improvement I still could not walk normally. His response was that the hip could be worse or it could be better.
I realise that the Covid epidemic might mean that the surgery could be cancelled anyway. I am also concerned that I do not leave it until I am really bad and in a lot of pain. I know this sounds rather pathetic but sometimes I feel that I cannot face having a hip replacement and I cannot face not having a hip replacement.
I would really appreciate your thoughts.

I apologise - I realise that this question will have been asked before but I don't know how far back to go in the posts here.
There was a reply to Dale, I think, which recommended cushions but could anyone recommend a suitable UK chair, with arms, for comfortable sitting pre and post THR?
I cannot sit comfortably in an 'easy' chair. I have found a chair on-line with homecarechairs but it has no reviews. I would like to manage without a riser/recliner if I can.
Thanks very much.

"hi people,
6 weeks post op & everything seemed to me to be going great....and probably still is!
Got rid of crutches last week & physio happy to have signed me off. I think what's happened since then is I have probably overdone things thinking that I might be somewhere near normal...which is typical of me. A couple of days ago I forgot about my hip it seems and got my self into a slightly awkward position trying to pick something up and probably stretched myself a bit. Since then I have felt that my
hip region is slightly more tender & a bit stiff in general. I'm sure there is no more to it than that but I'm probably looking for some reassurance that I need to rest up a bit.
I know that 6 weeks is still pretty early & I have probably just strained the healing tissues a bit, but me being me, will just focus on it being a 'step backward'
Anyone had any similar situations I'd love to hear from you!.
Walking is fine, no pain so I know there's no major issue but want to know if I should continue with short walks & exercises or whether rest means rest.
cheers Bob

Everything is going well so I can start driving again and dispose of the aids I was given e.g. cushion, toilet seat, grabber and crutches.
The surgeon was keen to emphasise how ""horrible"" my hip had been. It seems the femoral head had collapsed and that's why I was in so much pain.
Anyway, he said I can look forward to improving even more over the next year and the replacement should last ""many decades"". (I'm not sure I will though.)

"I am 43yrs old and have suffered from Rheumatoid Arthritis since i was 2yrs old. I have had numerous joint replacements, some even twice. On 24th August this year i had a right hip revision done. My surgeon said it was a difficult operation and he broke my femur during the revision. I have been recovering really well and almost ready to be walking with one crutch when on 3rd October i dislocated my hip. I was taken to my nearest hospital in Perth where they were in constant contact with my surgeon in Edinburgh. They managed to pop it back in but i have to wear a knee brace to stop knee from bending. I am having a check up with my surgeon on the 10th October. I have no idea what he will do about it. I am absolutely terrified to move in case it comes out again. I walk with 2 gutter crutches from the bedroom to the toilet and to the sitting room and thats as far as i go. Nobody mentioned if i am allowed to do any exercises as my muscles are going to get weak. Does anyone know if i can do some movement to help. I feel like i am back to square one again. I was in agony before the op but i am starting to wish i had just put up with the pain and never got this done. I dont want to be this nervous wreck scared to do anything for the rest of my life!

"I am 43 years old and have had 3 hip arthroscopies on my right hip. The first one was to repair a labral tear and remove bone to treat pincer impingement, the second was to remove scar tissue, and the third to remove scar tissue and release the iliopsoas tendon. 
I'm in significant pain with standing, walking, sleeping - most things. I had an MRI and it shows a tear, this time in a different place. My surgeon suggested a 4th arthroscopy but I'm very reluctant as I've concluded that my labrum is so prone to tearing and scar tissue that it will be a never ending story of hip arthroscopies. I'm more inclined to have a hip replacement or hip resurfacing but my surgeon is refusing, saying that because my cartilage is intact, that no surgeon would be willing to do a hip replacement. I would appreciate your feedback and suggestions about whether hip replacement and hip resurfacing would help my pain, given that I'm so prone to labral tears and scar tissue.

"Hi All
Well its exactly a year ago today ,12th Sept ,since i had my LHR .
I cant believe how quickly the year has gone and how my life has changed. Prior to the op i was struggling to walk 100 m without stopping and that prompted me after 5 years of rejections by my local NHS trust to invoke ""patients choice"" and choose my hospital and surgeon. I was incredibly lucky and was seen and operated on within 3 months.
I embraced the recovery process and followed all instructions including using crutches for the full 12 weeks after to avoid developing a limp. Safe to say now, everything just feels totally natural and sometimes i have to remind myself that the op even happened!!
Tomorrow i will be walking the 13.1 mile Virtual Great North Run as a milestone for myself to show how far this fantastic procedure has changed my life.

"Hi, I had an anterior hip replacement almost two years ago. I'm finally feeling good enough to step up my workouts and I've started doing Zumba again. I can't run anymore and Zumba is a close second to my most enjoyable workout. I've worked up to 3-4 times a week for an hour at a time. Recently I've felt a dull ache in my replaced hip and on a few occasions the side of my hip (where I've lost feeling from nerve damage) had a burning sensation so I stopped my workout. Sometimes it happens after I stop, but certainly not every time. Maybe it's just the nerve damage going away, maybe the soreness is simply muscle soreness from harder workouts? I'm going to my surgeon in a few weeks so he can take x-rays and make sure everything is intact. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced these pains once they started being more physically active. I'm only 39 and I don't want to become inactive because of my hip replacement, but I certainly don't want to cause more harm than good either.

"Hi everyone new to this forum.
Ten years post THR in right hip.
My hip has never been the same since having this surgery. I have asked numerous times to be sent for a MRI and my surgeon kept saying no this wasn't necessary as it was soft tissue damage and it would heal in time. In 2018 I had another surgery an Abductor repair to try and sort this issue, this didn't make any difference. 2019 I asked for a second opinion as soon as I saw this consultant he immediately sent me for a MRI. The result of the MRI were that my Gluteus Medius muscle had not been attached and was atrophied. I have no idea if this was done during my THR or when I had my second surgery. My guess is during the THR, for me to be in so much pain for years, which in my opinion means that my surgeon must have know about this after the second surgery.
Has anyone been through this who can offer any advice.

I tried chiropractors, dry needling (which did help a lot), massage, analgesic creams, hot, cold, saw an orthopedic surgeon who of course offered a dubious surgery suggestion.  I tried  everything I could possibly think of over these years.  I had had physical therapy and found it caused more pain instead of less.  I went a few more years and recently was told by a friend to try his physical therapist.  I was reluctant but was running out of options and felt I was headed for a surgeon search.

Perhaps this hard of work is too soon?  But I sure slept well that night from the exercise and that old familiar sense of accomplishment I used to know before all the hip problems and surgeries. I did not suffer any pain either.

"Having THR in late July and am wondering if a Lift Recliner Chair has been found useful by others? I have a leather sectional couch with 2 recliner pieces on each end, but they have manual controls and you have to use your body weight to put the footrest down and of course, bend forward when getting out, so I am wondering if that will be advisable. Also, your hips seem to sink lower than your knees in these two parts of my sectional couch. I hear that there are fewer restrictions with the anterior method which is the one I am having. I was also wondering if people found it more comfortable to sleep in a lift recliner for a time after the surgery. Or is this an unnecessary expense for an item which will not be used for that long of a period of time? Thanks

"Hello, I am 10 months out from a right sided Anterior THR, and I have been in constant pain in my right buttock, thigh and foot ever since. My surgeon admitted that he had quite a bit of difficulty with my procedure, and getting the needed parts into place.
It has suddenly occurred to me that when I went in for my pre-op x-ray, one week before the surgery, I was wearing an 11mm heel lift in my right shoe, as I had a significant leg length discrepancy (same side as my THR).
My question: would my wearing such a high heel lift have a negative effect on the xray's usefulness for templating and the overall effectiveness of the surgery??
Thanks in advance.

I had my left hip replaced in 2015 and everything has been fine but for the last few months I am getting pain in the groin when I lift my leg when exercising, and flexing my leg. I am really worried that there is something wrong. Has anyone got any ideas. Thanks in advance

"Hi All,
Current Age: 35
So I've been trawling the forum for quite some time reading all your stories and thought I would take the plunge and share mine in the hope that I can get some much needed advice/support in relation to what I have gone through over the last 20 months with my hip.
November 2018 is when I started struggling with severe lateral pain in my right only to be diagnosed with bi-lateral hip dysplasia with cam lesions on both sides (I was told at this point that without any doubt that I will need two hip replacements at some point in my life). After some initial tests I was told that the pain I was experiencing was down to bursitis and was given a steroid injection.
Now it did help with the muscular pain I was having but didn't with the pain I was experiencing when walking (with a limp) and especially with the whole sitting to standing motion. After going back to the consultant and having an MRI done I was diagnosed with a laberal tear and referred to a specialist to carry out an arthroscopy to attend to this.
I had my surgery on 10th February this year and upon waking was told by the surgeon that my hip was far worse than they imagined and that they had carried out the following procedures:
Laberal Debridement
Chrondoplasty
Removal of the cam lesion
Microfracture
and that ultimately the above had been done to buy me time before needing a hip replacement and that there were no guarantees with the success of the surgery.
During this time I actually feel like I am worse off based on the pain that I am continuing to experience and the fact that I have a terrible limp when trying to walk without cruthches.
With the impact that Covid-19 has had on the NHS I only had my follow up with the surgeon last week he ultimately advised that apart from successfully removing the cam lesion the surgery as a whole has pretty much failed and that there no further surgical interventions that they can offer apart from a THR which he is unwilling to do based on my age and the fact that it is unlikely that at this point that I would get even 10 years out of one. He explained that I have Grade 4 OA and that is ultimately what is now causing my persistent issues and that he was unable to microfracture the entire socket due to not being able to manipulate the drill at the required angles.
I was told that I will never play the sports I actively have played all my life will now be spectator sports which almost made me break down....
Finally I had an X-ray done while I was there and he compared it to one I had done in Oct 19 and it showed the arthritis was much worse! How?!! I've barely exerted myself post surgery so how can it have worsened.....
It's been a week today since I had to digest everything he told me and what this means now.....and I am struggling. The private physio I have engaged has said that I need to take a month at a time and that this is going to be an 'adjustment'.
Can anyone relate to the above or have some guidance that they can offer me at all? I'm really lost and upset about being in this position and ultimately don't know if there is anything I can do before it getting so bad that they have no choice but to do the surgery.
Thank you for taking the time to read the above - this is the first time I've reached out about my ordeal.

"I知 facing the prospect of a hip replacement later this year and seeking guidance from past patients as to what is the better procedure- Superpath or Direct Anterior.
Initially , I was focused on the Superpath approach based on its stated claims of being:
 the least invasive technique with minimal soft tissue disturbance and no dislocation of the hip
 quicker functional recovery
 inherent stability and no restrictions on hip position post surgery (ie no dislocation risk)
 less pain
 low complication rate
Most of this information supporting Superpath came from online data posted a few years ago. Only a few hip surgeons in Australia (I live in south east Queensland) appear to have been offering the Superpath procedure.
From further research , it appears that the majority of surgeons in Australia prefer the Direct Anterior approach. In the case of the few surgeons who have trained on both techniques, they also see Direct Anterior as the better approach.
The reasons given for Direct Anterior include:
 minimally invasive: it does not cut any muscles and is the only technique that provides a true inter-muscular and inter- nervous surgical approach
 quicker recovery, less post surgical pain and blood loss
 with Superpath, some of the glutius maximus muscle is split thus not muscle sparing like the anterior approach; the choice of implants is restricted; it is less amenable to intra -operative X-raying
I would be pleased to hear from others as to their experience with either of these 2 techniques.

I know hip replacements are great compared to a damaged hip but I can't get the thought of something going wrong so I'm scared.
I'm 32 and getting my left done in 2 weeks and then right side 6-8 week later.
also...how do I support my new hip even thought my other is damaged? anyone else been in a postion where both hips cause disability and pain - surely recovery is longer if you can't support the new hip.
thanks for the support,

"Hi everybody, having explored the possibility of a THR in Lithuania and France I finally agreed to the operation in a private hospital under an arrangement with the NHS. In the meantime I have read so many testimonials from "" I was trekking in the mountains only three months after the operation "" to "" After twelve months I am still in pain "". I can understand that this website is a place for people to discuss what might have left them uncomfortable after the operation - but can anybody tell me of operations that went perfectly, with recovery in just a few months. I have so many plans for when this darn hip is sorted - am I being unrealistically optimistic - or should I leave a six month gap in my diary ??

"Hi everyone, it's been a long time since I posted on the forum - I'm 4 years in from my TRHR & all is well (I forget I've even had it done now)!
I thought I would share The Rules of Sleep Club again as it affects all of us immediately after the op & it's one of the best pieces of advice that I was given by a fellow member.
So as you gather in closer to the screen to read I am going to poke you in the eye and tell you the first first rule...
There are no rules of sleep club
In fact there are so many rules of sleep club world wide that it would be hard to confine them all but we are all victim to our country, our county and surgeons particular cruelty (I mean surgical style) when it come to how we are supposed to sleep. Anterior, posterior and lateral scars all bring their own particular delights when trying to stop doing the twist in the early hours.
So, you can arm yourself with the latest in latex support pillows, V pillows, small hand embroidered cushions that Aunty Edna gave you, mattress toppers, wedges, sleeping tablets, pain relief, whiskey cocktail or a complete hospital bed but one thing isn't going to change - your healing!
Our lives before were clock driven , getting a good night's sleep before getting up for work was imperative. Lack of sleep meant we couldn't function properly.
Now, the God of New and Shiny Hip Implants has thrown all that up in the air and we don't know where we are!
We toss and turn (very carefully) waiting for the elusive sleep that never comes or comes in annoying one hour servings. You think you have slept all night only to find that barely ten minutes has gone by since you last looked at the clock. You hobble out of bed with one eye shut, trying to fool yourself into staying asleep while you have a midnight wee and you just know that if you lie there a bit longer then YOU MUST fall asleep.
As we all know things at night are magnified to horror proportions and the sweating, the pain, the twitching, the discomfort have all become mountains we cannot climb.
So, you have read this far and you are waiting for me to give you the secret to sleeping all through the night after having part of your leg chopped off and in a position that you detest. Sorry, I don't have have those answers but what I have learned is....
This lack of sleep, is it so bad? Are you hoping to go to work in the morning? Are you leaping out of bed to go hiking, on holiday, ice sking? No.
The best cure I can find for lack of sleep is - chill out, go with it, let it happen.
Goodness knows what healing is going on inside but it doesn't confine itself to happening at night. It is imperative to rest in the first 6 weeks as it is to walk and that rest can be feet up on the sofa or a few catnaps throughout the day.
I have no problems with lack of sleep because I don't care about it.
A six weeks (today) after my 2nd THR I have learned that it is all transient. Regular sleep comes back in a position that we favour eventually and the trick is to stop worrying about it.
I sleep most of the night now, waking up between 5.30 and 6.30am. Once you find that it okay to find a sleeping place all over the house you will sleep much better as well.I was more comfortable on the sofa this time so that's where I went.
I watched all the films that no one else wanted to watch and knew that I was getting back to normal when it took me five nights to watch a film.
So, wave yourself a magic wand, stop fretting, this is temporary and I'll even go as far as to say enjoy it. For those going back to work that will come soon enough and your body regulates very quickly so in the meantime give yourself a night break, chill out - a bowl of ice cream at 3am is really rather nice!

I couldn't face walking a quarter of a mile to the pub, that's how bad it was. Now I am happily walking 5 miles, doing the gardening, generally living a normal life. It's not all been roses on the way. Being on Tramadol and Ibuprofen for a month, then the jitters as I tried to wean myself off the Tramadol was not fun. Sleeping on my back for 6 weeks was not fun. But that was just a few weeks. I should have 20+ years before this new hip wears out, and who knows it might outlast me. So if anyone is wondering whether to have the operation done, I would say don't hesitate. Do it.

"Has anybody had experience of bursitis to post a total hip replacement? I suffered from bursitis for two years prior to my hip replacement. I was relatively pain-free for the first nine months after my hip replacement which was aug 2018 but gradually the bursitis started coming back again. I've had a couple of guided steroid injections but stupidly I went straight back to running within a week of the last one so kind of negated the benefits that it was giving. My consultant has given me IT band exercises as he feels the IT band is pressing on the bursa and I've been given strength exercises for the glutes and quads. I have Salsa danced ans taught salsa dancing for nearly 25 years I cycle regularly run Garden and I've always been very active so it was quite young for hip replacement at the age of 58. Now nestly two years on the pain from bursitis s is unbearable. I can only walk for two minutes at the most so although I have a young family I can't shop or cook for them properly now I can't look after my garden and I'm feeling miserable with the pain I get 3 to 4 hours sleep a night despite being on paracetamol codeine ibuprofen pregablin. i think doing JO Wicks set it off big time . i m waiting to see the consultant again but at a telephone consult 2- weeks ago he said that they can put another guided injection in to tide me over once radiology open up again but steroids being a big no-no because of Covid even though this isn't systemic steroid they won't do anything at the moment . Ultimately he suggested he cut a window in the IT band to remove the oressure and remove the bursa which will grow back but hopefully not in this angry state. Has anybody experience with this type of operation. The pain is both on the outside of the lake at the attachments for the IT band is but also it's causing cramping on the inside side in fact the pain is almost everywhere and it's difficult to differentiate where it's coming from now.

"I started getting pain in my legs and hips last year in January, and after numerous doctors visits, physiotherapy sessions and every attempt to find out why my walking was rapidly becoming more difficult, I was finally seen by a muscular skeletal specialist in September. I had a MRI hip scan which revealed bilateral chronic avascular necrosis of the femoral head and extensive bone marrow oedema.
I was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon who schedule the first hip replacement in December. Unfortunately, I failed the pre-op and due to the coronavirus epidemic, I'm still awaiting my first replacement. I am 48 years old and have a full-time job receiving a salary. I'm not able to walk very far any more and cannot get to the point where I used to get public transport to and back from work. I have had to resort to taking a taxi both ways which is gobbling up 25% of my salary. When I called the Jobcentre Plus, they advised me to claim Universal Credit which I duly did, but my claim was denied.
Is there anybody that could please share any information with me on how to go about making a benefit claim? I may try getting in touch with the Citizens Advice Bureau to discuss my situation with them, but welcome any feedback you can share.
I've now had a chance to view the Citizens Advise Bureau website and it has been extremely helpful. I'll update this post once I have any more information to share.

"This site is a great resource for those of us who have had hip replacements, as it allows us to share both advice and our experiences, good and bad. Inevitably, it will tend to feature more of the latter than the former, as people are far more likely to discuss problems than post when things have gone well. The potential problem with this is that this site is also accessed by those contemplating having a THR, so the risk is that they form rather a negative impression of the procedure. I therefore wanted to write a post about my experiences to possibly redress the balance.
By May 2019 my life had become a misery. I first noticed a problem with my hip about 5 years previously, with a slight clicking sensation and increasingly restricted movement. An X-ray revealed wear on the joint, but as I was only 52 at the time, the Doctor suggested taking no action until things got worse. Unfortunately, over time the problem progressed in to pain when doing sport, then pain when walking, to eventually constant pain which was affecting my work and sleep. Over this period I had to give up golf, then skiing, then walking any distance. I eventually even got to the point where cycling, a non-weight bearing activity, became agony.
At 57 I was just not prepared to give up on an active life so I decided to go for a Total Hip Replacement. I spent quite a bit of time discussing the options with the surgeon, eventually opting for a plastic cup, with slightly wider dimensions than normal for more stability when doing sport. I also opted for sedation with an epidural rather than a general anaesthetic. Come the big day I checked in to the hospital, changed in to a very unflattering gown, and walked in to the pre-op room where they gave me a jab. Next thing I remember was coming around in recovery, looking at some other patients who had taken the general route, and given how ashen they were, thinking how pleased I was for opting for sedation!
I was wheeled back to my room where I could call my wife to say I was out of the op. The epidural meant I could not feel the lower part of my body, but other than that I felt fine. Over the next 6 hours the epidural wore off, and there was some discomfort from the surgery, but given it had involved some heavy duty carpentry to my femur, this was not a great surprise. That said, other than one dose of morphine when the epidural had totally worn off, the only other pain relief I had during the whole exercise was paracetamol. Indeed the most noticeable thing from the pain perspective was that the constant ache I had suffered in my hip for the previous year was magically disappeared!
As to progress, the day after the op I was up and about, first with a walker but then with crutches. Next day I was getting up and down stairs on the crutches, with the physios starting me off on an regime of 6 exercises in reps. Next day I was home but carrying on the physio regime, probably doing more reps than suggested, but stopping the moment it became uncomfortable. The one thing I avoided was any form of stretching or bending that put excessive strain on the new joint. Within 4 weeks I was back driving an automatic, and back on a bike within 6. I am now back to cycling 30  40 miles in a session and am playing golf again. The high point however was in March when I had the best week of skiing that I have enjoyed in years.
I do not want to sound glib or dismissive of people痴 concerns, as there are risks with any op and there can never be any guarantees, but THRs have a very high success rate. A 2019 review by Bristol University of research from over 25 years, which included more than 500,000 patients, showed of all hip replacements analysed, 89% were found to last 15 years; 70% lasted 20 years; and 58% lasted 25 years. The technologies and techniques have got better in that time, so the projected lifespans of the joints is now even longer.
In truth, having the THR has given me back my life, hence the title of my post. My only regret was waiting 5 years to bite the bullet and get it done!
Cheers,
Bob

"i am almost two years post a complicated thr posterior approach and am having problems. i thought the problems were related to confirmed nerve and other soft tissue damage but i am now questioning the fit of the cup and whether it is rubbing and/or loose causing problems. xray appears to be normal but when i press my fingers into the ""sunken space"" around the incision when i walk i can feel the joint moving - it isnt painful. it feels something like a grinding feeling. i don't know if this is normal or not. has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know what this is?

"In 2016 I had my first hip revision done. My first hip lasted 21 years, I was 25 when I had it done. was born with hip dysplasia. Those 21 yrs were certainly the best years, absolutely no issues. When I got my revision done 4 yrs ago I had to have a bone graft as well because of some bone loss I suffered around the cup area. Fast forward 3 years and I had to have another revision because it was found that the bone loss had now spread to my pelvic bone. Another graft was done and the hip itself was still in tact so they didn't touch it. It's been almost 3 months since that revision and now every once in a while my hip would pop. I didn't think anything of it feeling it would go away once I heal up. Well the other night while in bed sleeping I guess I stretched too hard, I heard a loud pop and immediate pain. Not enough to wake me up but enough to notice it. When I got up in the morning and sat I now feel this bulge like I'm sitting on something. I am praying it's not dislocation of any sort. I didn't have the bulge feeling before. So I'm very concerned.

"I had a metal on metal hip replacement done in 2006 . For years I have been having increasing pain and weakness in my leg I also have been having issues such as headaches, double vision, memory loss, HTN, palpitations, edema, weight gain and peripheral neuropathy. After going to multiple orthopedic surgeons i was finally diagnosis with metallosis . I have two pseudo tumors effecting my muscle and soft tissue. I need major reconstructive surgery and have been sent to a specialist. Unfortunately there is not a doctor in my insurance network who can do the surgery. Four month later and I am still waiting on approval. I feel like my health worsens everyday but no one seems concerned. Has anyone else experienced heavy metal toxicity and metallosis?

"Hi. I've posted a few times on here and found you all to be a huge source of help & support. This time, my reach out is different. I had THR 12 weeks ago and was doing ok until 3 weeks ago when i inadvertidly tore a muscle in my operated leg. The pain i have been in since then is off the scale. It reminds me of the pain before i had surgury. I am back on 2 crutches, cannot sleep and have developed a fondness for Zapain to the point that i panic when running low. It doesnt help with the pain, but it serves to help me pass out. I cant bear to see pics or vids of myself before all this, hurts to think of my life before. I am 46 with 2 young boys and i think about taking my life because of this all the time. i have spoken to surgeon and had xray and he says all is well. I am scared that my life will never be free of this. Am desperate for help. Hope you all safe and doing ok in your recoveries xxx

"Had my new hip in Sept 2017 and on the whole it has been pretty good. I switched jobs from a very active, on your feet, 12 hour shift role to more regular 4 day week 6 months ago. I don't know if it is purely coincidence, but I am now finding my leg has become gradually weaker over the same amount of time. My job now involves more sitting, and during COVID lockdown I am now mainly doing phone consultations to patients. There is little opportunity in between calls to get up and walk around, and I am having increasing discomfort in the groin / inner thigh area. I don't think there is anything wrong with the mechanics of the joint, and feel it is all down to musculature. I now am unable to straight leg raise when lying down (which I could do before after several weeks post -op), but have no problem doing clamshells or squats. I sometimes get quite bad cramp type pain at the top of the buttock on walking distances, or when carrying a shopping basket etc. I also have to help my leg in by lifting with my trouser leg to get into the car. I wonder if anyone has any advice on which exercises to do to strengthen, as I don't know how to identify where the problem area is.

"i had a TRHR two years ago. After a few weeks i started experiencing terrible pain and could not lift my leg by itself. After numerous tests, it was determined i needed to have surgery to take another look as the surgeon called it. It was determined that i had a muscle tear. Long story short, the dr. used a cadaver muscle and lots of stitches. Things went good for a while. I began having pain and burning. I had steroid injections and they did not help. While doing the injection the PA said it was like trying to inject a needle into sand. It was real grainy feeling. They now think the cadaver muscle has calcified. Has anyone had this to happen or know of anyone that has had issues such as this?

"Hi,
I started feeling excruitiaing pain around 6 years ago after a ski trip. Me being be I limped around and suddenly the pain all but dissapeared. Then around 2 years ago my joints flared up (I am a coeliac aswell) and my hip started being very painful again. This time I went to the doctors and due to the long wait in the NHS i paid for a private surgeon to have a look. Immediately he said there is nothing we can do but wait until the hip pain gets too bad and replace it but couldnt give me a valid reason for this? It turns out I had a partial thickness larial tear after the ski trip but he said that wouldnt have caused it. But apart from that I can see a reason. I was only 28 when it was diagnosed as severe arthritis. He also said it looked worse in my other hip but as I was private and had only paid for one he didnt go any further with that.
Anyone else have any ideas. Im currently waiting for a visa to come through so I cant visit the doctor at the minute incase it messes up my application. Im completely stumped. Im only 30, no signs of dysplasia and both my hips are knackered! I dont do any massive amounts of sport and such. Anyone else in a similar boat? feel like crying all the time ha

I have been doing my exercises religiously every day and have suddenly started to experience that familiar severe sharp pain in the bad hip, which is now making it difficult to continue exercising.

"After 3.5 years of being on crutches I finally saw a new surgeon in November last year who agreed to do my hip replacement February, eventually I got the date through 31st March and you guessed it I got a call from the NHS saying that they had to cancel,, to say I was gutted doesn't remotely cover it.
I was absolutely petrified but had come to terms with having it done and was so looking forward to being able to walk again unaided even if he said I would still have to use the crutches for about a year.
Now I could be on them a dam sight longer.
I suppose I'm not the only one but doesn't make it any easier to deal with, can't even go out, that doesn't help.

"Hi everyone
I'm 36, have Hip Dysplasia and Im due a THR in three months because im bone on bone and the surgeon says it cant wait. I have never been so terrified in my life and I dont know what to do. I have never had surgery before, and I am overwhelmingly afraid of pain, immobility and feeling trapped/claustrophobic/blaming myself for making a terrible decision on the other side. Everyone is so well-meaning but their focus is always on not having arthritic pain on the other side which I dont have anyway - I just have soreness and a poor range of mobility/rotation. I still walk ok, just not distances. Im painfully aware that there will be no immediate relief for me after surgery and that I might feel worse than I do now.
Ive tried to be proactive and Im accessing mental health and CBT counselling and have been open with my GP, but Im in pieces. Ive never felt so lost or alone, Im crying daily and everyone around me seems frustrated and just tells me it'll be fine in the end. Im so afraid of the first few weeks. Im so scared I wont cope and I'll be in agony. I dont know why I feel this way, Ive overcome a lot in my life but this just terrifies me.

My feet were fine before all this and not bad up until the knees done last fall. It is only the topside boney area that is under the tongue of any give shoe. Aches like hell Bottom side and toe area is fine.
I've tried nearly everything that common sense brings to mind. Different shoes. Drugs like advil, tylenol, aleave etc. Ice, heat and all is a temporary relief but back again in a day or so..
I sent an email off to the ortho surgeon because I have had enough. I'm sure it is a direct result of these 4 surgeries but trying to fix it.

"Does anyone have any idea why when I use a spade or lawn edge and press down I get a searing pain in my thigh area, I believe at the level of my scar. Whatever is in there is getting increasingly touchy. For example it can become painful to sleep on my scar side and when I walk I get pain and discomfort across my thigh around the scar level or perhaps a bit lower. I feel I limp because of the pain in my thigh but also the surgeon took no notice when I told him he was operating on my naturally longer leg and succeeded in making the difference even greater. This will not help I am sure. Added to all this I currently have a pain underneath my thigh which can travel down to just above my ankle. This comes on when I sit on a typists chair or spend some time driving. I believe it is due to the curved seat both have, but why.
I am wondering if the pin that was put in is not sitting correctly. I had to ask the surgeon at my 6 weeks check up about my leg length difference. He was not forthcoming. His notes say my leg length was 'good'. He reluctantly measured me and told me that he put in the shortest pin possible without fear of it coming out. Anybody understand what these words mean? He may have put in the shortest pin but I feel very hitched up on that side, as though I have something too large in my body.
In recent times I have spent ｣500 on physio with virtually no change and I have joined her beginners pilates group. Ironically I had done pilates for 20 years before my op. but no way can I do the things I used to do then.
Has anyone proved that their hip joint was not put in correctly. I can and do live with it, but I'm still in my 60s and was extremely active before this and feel a bit downhearted when I cannot say that I no longer think of my replacement. I feel it from the moment I get up. The consultant barely spoke to me before and afterwards. It feels like I was just on a conveyor belt.

"Hello!
25 Y/O
I did a THR 4 weeks ago. Right after the surgery I COULD move my foot without problems. Just hours later it went totally numb and just died totally. Couldnt move it in any direction. Just barely move my toes. It felt like it fallen asleep.
My lower leg also lost all its sensation and went totally numb.
All of the lower leg just went paralysed.
Within 5 days after surgery the leg got its sensation back. The foot was still numb and almost no sensation with pins and needle feeling. I couldnt move it.
A week later i could move the foot sideways but not upwards. I had foot drop still.
4 weeks passed and Its now 5 weeks post op and i still cant lift my foot and my foot has now started to BURN. Terrible pain!!
Its like pins and needles with electric shocking combined with burning pain.
It goes up and down during the day. No real pattern. Sometimes the pain is so terrible I just scream and cry. When I push my foot downwards, like pressing my toes down it burns like hell in the foot. Like the nerve screams.
I eat painkillers and morphine but it barely helps for the nerve pain.
Hip doesnt hurt that much. Upper leg has no problems with pain or sensory. Lower leg is 95% fine with small sensory problems at the lower part. The foot is the huge problem.
I had my leg lengthened by the surgery about 2 cm if that have anything to do with it.
So,
Hours after surgery my foot just died. One week later it had alot of numbness and pins and needles.
4 weeks later its numb, hurts to touch. Just the blanket touching it hurts bad. The foot feels like its BURNING UP combined with shocks! Terrible!
Is this good? Signs of healing or is it getting worse? Should I seek medical care asap?
First week i got some movement and sensation back but after that more pain...
Is it the foot waking up and feels pain or is it the nerve dying?
The fact that I could move the foot right after surgery(first hours) makes me wonder what happened. The nerve wasnt damaged by the surgery it self. Just right after the surgery something happened.
Im so scared this is permanent. I cant live with this. Its so terrible.
Anyone had similar problems? Anyone have any ideas what it could be? Will it heal!?
Help!
Thanks you!

"Hi,
I had a Left THR 10 months ago and have been amazed at how well it all went. I did the post op exercise plan pretty rigourously and am back to doing 40 mile cycle rides and rounds of golf, all without problem. Indeed other than occaisional stiffness it is easy to forget i have a big lump of metal inside me.
Anyway i am booked to go skiing next month so i would be interested to know how other THR Recipients who have subsequently skied have got on. i am not a total headbanger on the slopes but will happily take on black runs at my own pace. i am just a little unsure about how hard i can push things.
Any experiences gratefully received.

"hello all so I made my complaint against my surgeon that ended my career he did what I thought was a simple hip replacement and it ended up in 2 hip revisions 2 dislocations and an emergency surgery that he put in a ring to hopefully stop my hip from dislocating again amd with this ring I guess it gives me a warning first before it dislocated. I sure hope it doesnt dislocate again it gets super painful each time. and now I'm seeing a new surgeon next weds and have to do a series of xrays the morning of my appointment for left hip and left knee. as i need surgery down the road for my left knee as i have patella femoral syndrome and a torn acl bundle tear and i think it was caused from my first dislocation, or it just started to wear out over the yrs cause I was a kitchen supervisor so I was always on my feet then being a ft mommy and wife so never got to rest. and my knees arnt straight they dont sit in the middle when I stand they go inwards and when I sit they go outwards. also have a family drs appointment today in half hr as I'm having circulation problems since my last emergency surgery 6 weeks ago

"good afternoon my fellow peeps. so I've been posting on here for awhile now and keeping people up to date. so um a 37 yr old female I had a hip replacement left side in 2017 then 2018 had a revision and they cut a tendon as I had an impingement then jan 6th 2019 had my first dislocation then again dec 3rd 2019 had a second revision then jan 23rd 2020 had a very serious dislocation and it was stuck behind the socket/pelvic bone. it was far by the worst any dr here in sask canada has ever seen so had to have an emergency surgery jan 26th and they had to put in a ring which ended my working career as it imitates my mobility. and I'm only 6 weeks post op from this and was on antibiotics for 4 weeks as this ring has a 90 percent chance of infection. so anyways I'm on bedrest for 5 months no driving no sitting no bending no working nothing it's far by the worst I suffer ptsd depression amd anxiety u name it. and my hip is still quite swollen and has fluid buildup which my surgeon said to leave it and not get it drained it will go away in a few minutes ths but let me tell ya its painful. but at night I feel like my whole left leg gets numb and my foot turns ice cold no matter what i try to do to keep it warm. then it turns hot like I dont understand it. and being on bedrest sycks cause I get so uncomfortable and sore from laying down all the time. I'm wondering if theres nerve damage or poor circulation. and my bath days are over as well as I dislocated it while having a bath. anyone else experience numbness on the side u got ur hip replacement, and the scare has been cut open 4 times. and to top it off I have patella femoral syndrome and a torn acl bundle tear which I need surgery on after my hip heals which will be a long road of recovery. but I am seeing another surgeon he is the best in sask and to get a second opinion I've been on the wait list for 7 months. also I had the anterior approch which they say is less invasive. but why do I keep dislocating I'm following all the protocols. I also was born with hip dysplasia and my surgeon knew that so why couldnt he got a ball and cap custom made to fit as my sockets are very shallow and he admitted that it was the smallest one they had.

"I had a lhr last May and have been very pleased with the results... pain in that hip gone. A few issues because of leg length difference, but all in all a much better situation than before surgery. Just recently though I have had some pain in my right hip. It is gradually getting worse, though not as bad as left hip was yet. My replacement was due to arthritis in my hip. I am worried that the right hip is now going the same way as the left. The symptoms are the same, but it seems to be progressing faster. Would like to hear from others with arthritis, maybe give me an idea as to what may be happening? Have any of you had the same situation? I am 63 years old and quite healthy otherwise.

"Hi
I've received my pre op letter and been advised that within 22days of having this I should have had op.
my only worry is, that I need the operation this time on left side but due to us having the small bedroom in the house giving the kids more room I cannot change where the bed is and can only get in bed one way,which would mean getting in left/operated side first this time. I'm sure someone out there would have had same issue and want to see how they managed
For me in dec when had right hip done wasnt an issue as straight away i was getting in bed good side first.

I have been religiously doing my exercises each day (which isn't easy with the constant pain in my left hip, something which I have become used to).

I am able to walk quite normally with a stick and can climb two flights of stairs without any difficulty. The only issue I have is that when I have been sitting for more than 15-20 minutes, or when I wake up in the morning the first few steps that I take are reminiscent of the pre THR days, i.e. they are quite painful. After a couple of minutes I am moving freely. Is this to be expected and I am worrying unnecessarily? Any advice would be most welcome. Thank you.

"I went for my 12-month check yesterday. I was X-rayed, and it looked brilliant. I am delighted with where I have got to, and so is my surgeon.
I go for hours at a time completely forgetting that I have had my hip replaced. Zero pain. I have been playing tennis for the past 4 months, getting more flexible and running better all of the time. Also I'm doing lots of walking.
There's only one thing I can't yet do - I can't quite get my operated foot onto my un-operated knee to rub in cream and put a sock on it, as I do with the other foot/knee (I have very dry skin, so this is a daily chore). My surgeon promised me this will come in the next six months. Until then I'll just have to keep bending that foot behind me to reach it.
It wasn't all a piece of cake in the early weeks and months, so those who are at that stage, keep optimistic, keep taking the painkillers and keep doing the exercises. Unless you are very unlucky (and I recognise that some people are) you should be in my position in a few months' time.
Good luck!

"I thought it may help some to understand my journey to date. I will try to update as I hopefully progress further.
I am just approaching my 66th birthday and my left hip had been getting progressively over a two year period and was now seriously effecting my ability to work and my life in general.
I have private medical insurance and a much younger neighbour had recently had a THR by Mr Hugh Apthorp at The Spire in Hastings Sussex and had recovered so fast and so well he said it had changed his life and would highly recommend both the hospital and certainly the surgeon.
I therefore got a referral from my GP saw Mr Apthorp on the 12th November 18 and booked myself in for the op straight after Christmas. My pre op was on the 20th December 18 where i picked up my crutches and some post op exersises from the physio, had an ECG, blood test etc ready for the big day.
I was a little nervous but in all honesty I was more worried about my wife sitting waiting for two to three hours for me to come out of surgery having done it a few times for her I know thats not a nice wait.
On the day of the op I arrived for my 7:30am admission where we were very well looked after by a very nice nurse. The surgeon Mr Apthorp and the anaesthetist both came to see me, the surgeon drew an arrow on the correct leg and the anaethetist explained what was going to happen, I was having a spinal block injection and general anaesthetic.
Just after 10am I walked down to theater had a cannula fitted then I knew or felt nothing until I was in recovery. Soon after coming round I was taken to x-ray and the radiologist said I have a lovely new hip. Then back to my room almost exactly on time as my wife had been told that was around 12:30pm.
I cant quite remember the exact timings but what seemed to be an hour or so after I was offered a sandwich and cup of tea and ordered my evening snack. At around 5pm I was testing my new hip with a short walk in the corridor on crutches of course, amazing to think I had major surgery just a few hours earlier.
That night wasn't the best night I have had as I find it very difficult yo sleep on my back and it also did seem to take a little while to get pain under control though it wasn't as painful as I had expected it was enough to keep me from sleeping.
The next day was much improved and I sat out in the chair all day and had a much better nights sleep. I was able to walk to the bathroom and so didn't resort to a bed pan at any time, though the nurse needed an assistant to be sure I supported on the journey should I have needed it.
Day three was really a shower, breakfast, a blood test to be sure bloods were ok, physio to be sure I could walk up and down stairs and then going home meds and dressings and then I was away home by 11:30am with a follow up wound review and physio booked for two reeks later.
Arrival at home was a little scary at first as very I quickly I realised I didnt have the grab rails around the toilet or in the shower, my wife was concerned she would be able to look after me. By the next day though we were confident we were fine and every day since has shown an improvement over the previous day.
The most difficulty part of my recovery to date has been sleeping. I am normally a side sleeper and found it very difficult to sleep or even get comfortable on my back. I have also found that discomfort and pain has been worse at night than in the day time. In fact several days I have not needed much if any medication during the day but at night I have needed it so have been taking a couple of paracetamol at bed time followed by another two half way through the night with a back up of one codein if needed. Pillows, three behind me and one under the top of my legs. That said I am now beginning to see the night discomfort start to decline and am beginning to sleep better.
The discomfort I have experienced has been similar to sciatica with pain in my knee. I have also had a numb thigh on the non operated leg which in the night can also feel like boiling water on my leg, not sure if that is a result of the spinal block and how long it will take to recover hoping it will.
I have made sure I have carried out all my exercises during the day both standing and bed. I have also been walking outdoors from about day five, first on two crutches then after a week on one crutch. At the end of week two I am up to just under a mile outdoors each day with one crutch. Interestingly I am finding my hip works really well and that shows how unfit I got because I was not able to walk.
Today was my wound review and first physio follow up at the hospital since my op. I had changed dressings twice at five day intervals as advised on leaving the hospital, and a couple of days ago decided to leave the dressing off as it looked so good, just less than 4 inches long very straight and perfectly neat having been internally soluble stitched and skin glued, the scar will be minimal when healed. All was good with the wound.
My physio follow up went really well during which my exercises were checked and then I was given some additional exercises to carry out at home, then I was asked to walk down the corridor and back with one crutch then no crutch and it was then suggested using no crutch whilst in doors at home.
I am fortunate to be able to work from home so started doing that one week after the op though to be fair and unknown to my wife I was answering email the afternoon of my op! I continue to work from home this week but next week will be traveling back into London on public transport to work.
Hopefully my progress will continue as well as it has to date but I will keep you updated or please do ask if there maybe anything I can help with or put your mind at rest on.
My next appointment at the hospital is on the 15th Feb with Mr Apthorp and Physio, hopefully I will be running by then!

The scan shows i have a mass of something on my thigh muscle, that is causing the pain and stopping me from lifting my leg. walking up stairs, getting into bed, getting into cars. anything where you need your leg to lift its self. is hard to do and very painful. even sneezing or coughing is painful to the hip area.
My surgeon is referring me to a different hospital that deals with lump bump & cancers.

"Hi,
I'm 42 and had a THR 25 Nov 19. Since day one I've had a swollen painful knee on the operated side, which doesn't seem to be improving - I am having physio and doing the exercises. The other day I heard my knee crunching when I was going up stairs and also this morning when I was doing my squat exercises. Has anyone else had similar symptoms, including crunching noises in their knee, and what was your outcome?
Secondly, I am 10 weeks post op today and cannot walk without one crutch due to limping. I also lean over to the unoperated side when walking on the crutch. Has anyone else had this, and if so, how long did it take for your limp/lean to subside?
I'm quite worried about these issues and would really welcome any reassurances from others who have experienced similar. Thanks.

"Today I went for my first follow up appointment and I thought I would share my experience so far. I must admit, for the first 8 days, I thought I'd made a mistake as it was rough ! I had no idea how hard it would be with my first experience of being in hospital, the trauma of the aneathatist trying to get the cannula in my hand (which took 6 attempts), the pain of the injection in my spine (which I was told shouldnt be painful), the sickness and diarrhoea from all the drugs administered and the amount of help I underestimated needing once I got home. However, after the first 8 days I started to feel the benefits and whilst I still questioned whether I would ever have the nerve to go through it all again with my second hip replacement (date to be determined),I persevered and tried to remain positive. With the help of this group and sheer determination, after 4 weeks and 4 days I once again (literally over night), felt a significant improvement and I am glad to say that I am now completely mobile, pain free and have absolutely no regrets. I don't think anyone can quite prepare you for the mental and physical challenge of this surgery, but after 6 weeks and 3 days, I can honestly say that I am now looking forward to continuing with my rehabilitation, regaining strength and flexibility in my new hip aswell as setting the date for my other hip replacement later in the year. Thank you everyone who responded to my questions and concerns on my journey.

"I壇 love to hear from anybody who has been left in pain following hip surgery using the Superpath technique. 
I had a hip replacement at Coventry Hospital  in August 2017 and came round from the operation in severe pain.  I was told that my surgeon had used a modern technique called Superpath and I was likely to recover more quickly than expected. The surgeon, Michael Cronin, had not discussed this technique with me, and I would not have agreed to the technique had he asked my opinion. My severe pain was ignored, even though it was a sharp contrast to the lack of pain in other patients whose surgeons had used more traditional techniques. 
Six months later the pain hasn稚 gone. I have been in severe pain 24/7 since the operation. My mobility is worse than before and the hip seems to move and click. My foot is numb and I have pins and needles in my back and leg. The response from them hospital has been slow and reluctant and I知 told my surgeon has now left the department. 
I have seen on this site that at least two other people have had the exact same experience with this surgeon. Would love to know if anybody else has had the same problem and whether the situation has improved over time.

"In a way I'm glad the way my hip replacement came about...my hip was fractured for 2 weeks and I didn't know it...I thought it was bursitis or something and I'd wait it out. I was shocked when ER told me. I had surgery next day, came home day after that. I had no preparations but was lucky enough not to need anything. At my 2 week followup last week ...dr. said I was best outcome he'd ever had...no need for physical therapy....just exercise a little on my own.
I guess I'm telling everyone this...make plans, but don't overthink it....it might go easier than you're imagining.

"Hello all, I want to give a positive update and hopefully encourage some people out there that might be sitting on the fence like I was about whether or not to have the surgery. I am now 12 weeks post anterior approach LTHR and starting to feel like my old self. I still get tired, stiff with nerve pains occasionally BUT my mobility has really taken off this last week. I went hiking in the woods with my husband, can climb short flight of stairs unaided, and finally was able to tie my shoes myself today...WOW...what a great feeling. I am so grateful to God, my Surgeon(s), all the nurses, my family, friends and co-workers, all the people on this forum who I have gained support and information and of course my Husband who helped me so much with my recovery....

"I previously asked you lovely helpful people about my problem ditching my crutches and the general consensus seemed to be that I will know when it is time. I feel as though I am barely putting any weight on the one crutch I am using (although I do use 2 when I go out, as people seem more willing to give me a wide berth) and I decided today to just go for it. I managed about 20 steps (around the dining room table), but had a sharp pain every few steps in the hip and groin area. is this normal ? should I stop try again for a few days or keep trying each day ? I have no pain at all any other time. I am 4 weeks and 2 days post op and desperate to get back to normal as soon as possible but don't know if I am doing too much or too little. I do my exercises 4 times a day without a problem and even feel I could do more advanced exercises. I don't have any more physio for 5 weeks.

"Hello, i broke my femur (and 16 other bones) 3 years ago. I've been in pain ever since and could barely walk as my hip joint continued to collapse. I'm now getting a full hip replacement, FWB with anterior or anterior lateral approach (depending on how the surgeon will remove the existing hardware), i was given a leaflet. I did some research and found that the whole ""don't bend more than 90 degrees, don't cross this or that"" circus isn't needed with an anterior approach. So why am i being advised to follow the same precautions as for a posterior approach replacement? Is this simply the wrong leaflet or are they simply overly careful? Any advice would be much appreciated.

"hello all it's me again so I had my emergency surgery to put my hip back in jan 25th I got my staples out today and think maybe we should have waited at least one more week cause when the nurse took my staples out it stung really bad and I usually have a high pain tolerance but this was worth then childbirth. we counted 37 staples. and my incision split open a little bit so the nurse put sterile strips in and a waterproof bandage so I can have a shower. but its irritated and dry and burning. I sure hope this is my last surgery I cant keep having surgery every single yr. i see my surgeon again feb 19th and even my family dr agrees this will be my last visit as oviously hes doing something wrong. he gave me crap for going to my family dr to have an ultrasound done cause my hip was still very swollen and we found out there was fluid buildup and it shouldnt have been there. I think hes trying to cover his tracks. cause he knew something was wrong he said dont do anything without my permission but yet says if somethings wrong go see my family dr. and it seems like this is becoming a pattern I had 1st hip replacment in april 2017 then a revision dec 18th 2018 dislocated in a restaurant Jan 5th then had another hip revision dec 3rd 2019 dislocated having a bath jan 23rd. this shouldnt keep happening for a simple hip replacement. so no physio no walking bending twisting nothing for 4 months as what he told me. so pls people be super careful and listen to ur dr dont do anything until dr gives u the ok. stay on ur crutches or cane for as long as needed.

"Hi everyone, I've got a ct scan on my left hip end of this month and I'm not feeling optimistic about it, I had my left hip replaced June 2017 and my right 2018, my left hip has never been right since I had it done, the surgeon who did my THR has now left England and gone back home to his native India leaving my now consultant to address my problem.
I have had x Ray's, bone scans and MRI scans all coming back negative.
The pain what I am experiencing is in the groin area which comes on when trying to lift my leg up if say sitting down, also going up stairs, getting in a car, getting dressed, anything where I have to move my leg into an upward motion, I asked my surgeon that if the ct scan results come back negative than what else could it be, he thinks the hip is not aligned properly, my question is does or have any person had the same problem and if so what does it entail surgery wise and has it worked.
Any answers or explanations are welcome.

"4 weeks ago I had my first hip replacement (the other hip will be done at the end of this year) and my surgeon told me that, due to my age (48), physio would be very important to get the best from my new hip and help with recovery. I was told to make an appointment for 2 weeks after surgery to get me started and then rebook with the physio whilst there. I was unable to get an appointment until 3 weeks after and so made the decision to move on to the week 2 exercises (thanks to the internet) in the meantime. When attending the physio on (week 3), she checked that I had been doing all exercises correctly (which I had) and told me that they no longer offer more physio as it is not necessary. I am still on crutches and have not been able to walk properly for 5 years which has resulted in muscle wastage and so was eager to learn some strengthening exercises once I am off my crutches. Can anyone advise me on what I should do ? Is it safe for me to follow exercises from the internet ?

Which means I only have two weeks left of wearing these dreadful stockings!
I have no more arthritic pain and I am very thankful for that.
I do have however still have my dressing on but its only leaking a small amount now.
I am happy to use one crutch indoors but have a stumbling block when going back to one outside. But will do another short walk with just one later on today.
My operated side thigh feels very tight and I am struggling to walk without a limp unaided, although I am trying at home as well.
I am doing all my my exercises, but the one I really struggle with is the 'clam', I do this on with my operated side and really cannot lift my leg unless I use my hand!
I am sure the walking will come back soon but I am happy to have no more pain and walking with crutches is a pleasure just have to get rid of limp so that is a pleasure without.

"I had a right hip implant on May 3, 2018.
The technique used was Superpath . The hip manufacturer is Wright medical.
I have had a 5 to 8 pain issue that continues to today 24/7. I've had blood tests, sonogram , bone scan, 120 physical therapy sessions (in 2019), 4 pain management treatments. In all I visited 14 Doctors for second opinions . All of then could not suggest a solution, including the Doc who did the implant. Two weeks ago I consulted with a Doc who diagnosed the problem . We are waiting for more info, but he believes that the the neck needs to be longer. A short neck was used ,maybe causing the tissues to be compressed.
this make sense ,because of my continual pain and limited range of motion . I can not bend over far enough to put a sock on.. Entering a car is difficult because of limited ability to twist my leg. After 19 months I am just about running out of patience.
I am looking forward to a conversation with you.

"hi
I'm 6wks post op tomorrow.
my question is should I be able to:-
lift the operated leg high in bed? I just dont seem to.
(sorry for the wording here) but open my legs or open this leg out to the side? again I've tried and its slowly increasing every day, but is this something I will or should be able to do?
I hear alot of people talk about PT but I've never had any or been referred. I just had 2 sessions 15mins each after my op in hospital.
As i had to re arrange my appointment for my 6wk follow up, i dont see my consultant till I'm 9wks post op. so got a book and writing questions down to ask.
I stopped using crutches inside from 3wks and outside since 4wks post op and taking good strides but tire easily in afternoons but no pain or discomfort and ive been back at work since 2wks 3days post op.
we talk about precautions, but no one says really what you should be able to do (I appreciate everyone is different and time isn't an issue) but would be nice to know questions...
I.e
will I ever be able to fasten my shoes again
will I be able to have normal intimacy without thinking about precautions.
will I be able to kneel to garden or get down on floor to sort out boxes.
will I be able to bend down to pick up my small dog??
also when can I start bending passed 90 degrees and how will I know?
I cannot find answers... and thought best to ask people who've been through this and have experiences....
sorry for long post..

"Hi i had THR 9 days ago, it was done in a surgery center instead of hospital.
I checked in at 6:30am, surgery started 7:30, I was in recovery by 9:20 and being WALKED out the door by 11:40! It was absolutely the worst experience ever.
I had my other hip replaced 3 1/2 years ago with the same doctor but at the time it was one night in the hospital. He now does out patient when he can due to less chance of infection. I was a same day candidate because I'm fairly young (53) and healthy. The pain I was in when they got me up and walked me out was excruciating. The first 2 days at home were also a challenge.
I'm wondering what other peoples experience with same day hip replacement surgery was like.

"Hello all,
I'm twenty-two years old and underwent total right hip replacement surgery six weeks ago. The recovery process has been fairly smooth sailing so far despite significant discomfort and pain in the first two weeks. I am walking mostly without a crutch within the house, and only use one when I'm outside. I've been trying to complete my physiotherapy exercises three times a day, but sometimes stick to twice a day if I'm feeling sore.
I've had my six week follow up today and the surgeon seems satisfied that I am recovering well, although there is a slight discrepancy in leg length due to an underdeveloped pelvis from a congenital health condition. Despite this he maintained that I was doing well, and told me not to come back until November for my next check up.
In addition to this I have my first physiotherapy appointment at the hospital tomorrow, so I'm hoping she will shed some light on what I can and cannot do. When did everyone else feel comfortable going out alone? Or using public transport? Walking in large crowds? I don't drive and I worry that I may injure myself attempting to get off and on a bus or tram. I also worry I will be banged into if I walk down a busy street, as some people can be oblivious to others. Of course I plan to use my crutch until I am told otherwise. I am just sick of being cooped up in the house! It's starting to really get me down.
Any help would be much appreciated!

"Hello all,
Since June I have had very bad pains in my right buttock. I believe the problem started when I was doing high (higher than usual) leg lift exercises. For months the problem has continued and about a month ago I started to see a chiropractor. I've done some research on my own with reading and videos online and the suggestion by most was not to see a family physician but to visit a chiropractor. Therefore, I have and am receiving stim (electrical stimulation, and adjustments once a week. Although advised by the office that these things take time and isn't something that heals overnight, I seem to be getting no relief. I use ice on/off throughout the day on my lower back, and the pain seems to be mainly in my right buttock, with sciatic pain that shoots down my leg and is very painful. I also have groin pain and can tell I am walking strangely because of all of this. He had me on 3 stretch exercises but just reduced me to 1 and said not to overdo it. I don't feel I am but, ugh.... painful and prolonged. Any suggestions?

"IMHO this happens far more often than is recognized by the doctors and physical therapists. If you have groin pain after a THR investigate if it is your psoas muscle and Iliopsoas Tendinitis. Your physical therapist should be able to easily find your psoas muscle and push down and you will recognize that is where the pain is coming from.
AFTER TWO WEEKS- If you CAN do this,
Lay flat on your back on the bed with your shoes off
Keeping your heel in contact with the bed, bend your knee and drag your foot up towards your butt
But CAN'T do this
Lay flat on the bed with your shoes off
Keeping your leg straight (don't bend the knee)
Raise your foot up off the mattress (you are using your hip muscles for this)
AND your groin hurts like HELL in certain situations, but not all situations, you probably have iliopsoas tendonitis.
You need to pay attention and be VERY careful. Think of tendonitis as little small rips into the tendon. What you need to do is rest the tendon and don't do anything to make the tears bigger (deeper). You want to not aggravate it, let it rest and let those little rips heal up.
Most people think that they simply need to exercize or stretch more, and in fact this is the opposite of what you should do, doing that only makes it worse and can result in a permenet condition as scar tissue will form over the rips.  Trust me on this I had tendonitis in my IT Band that I ignored, kept on working, that tuned into a perment condition (Tendonosis). It actually disabled me, so I am rather an expert on Tendonitis.
During your hip replacement they have to manipulate your leg and move it into positions it is not used to, this can pull that psoas muscle/tendon. OR your prosthesis is to big, or placed wrong and you will have this conditon until they go in and fix that.
Since I previously had Tendonosis I recognized the pain and symptons immediately. It was confirmed by my physical therapist. What I did was not exercize at all for 3 - 4 weeks. That is the amount of time it took for that iliopsoas tendonitis to heal back up. Only after that was healed up did I take up exercizing again, my physical therapist simply gave me leg massages during this time.
I found I had to lay down on the sofa not sit in a chair, as sitting in a living room chair was just a bad position for that tendon, so I layed around until it healed. What was very odd is that sitting in the chair wasn't that much of a problem initially, but when I got up from the chair it hurt. The good news, it did heal up just fine and I have had no further issues with it.
Google -  iliopsoas tendonitis after hip replacement
There is one woman on here I was able to help. Her prosthesis was digging into the tendon, her doctors did a surgery and did something (not sure what) and that fixed it. I know she did not have to have her prosthesis removed or changed out, instead they did something with the tendon instead.
Another woman I was able to help, she was doing great after her THR, about a month/ 5 weeks after her THR she was stepping off a pier to get into a boat and that is where she injured her iliopsoas tendonitis. Of course she was ""stretching"" and exercizing thinking that would help, which it did not, she followed my advice, simply rested the tendon by not doing anything that aggravates it and in about 3 to 4 weeks she was fine also.
If you have pain in your groin it is either nerve damage or the iliopsoas tendonitis. Nerve damage will travel down to your foot, Iliopsoas Tendinitis will stay sore in your groin area.
I am not a big fan of rigerous exercize right after surgery anyway. Think about it, they cut off the top of your leg bone and shove a stick in it. It simply takes time for that stick to get knitted back into the leg bone. I was forced to not exercize because of the iliopsoas tendonitis and at 4 weeks I started. In a matter of one week I went from using a walker/trolly to walking completely on my own with nothing. I just focused on keeping my back very straight and not bending over, in other words being very attentive to keeping good posture. I am more of a fan of , don't push yourself, let the bones heal up, when the bones are good and strong you will be able to get back into the swing of things very quickly. Good Luck to you.
----------------
Here is Shaye's reply to me---------------
Interesting that you say 'as sitting in a living room chair was just a bad position for that tendon' as I find sitting on an upright dining chair doesn't feel good after about 10 minutes. Driving is easier as I can tilt the seat back. In the article I read it said experiencing the pain getting out of a car was a sure sign this was the problem but so far I've only done the 'knees together and swivel' like we did when we wore mini skirts haha!! Next time I get in the car I'll try it the way I did it before I ever had a hipproblem.
Hi again Shayes
An update- I wentto my physio last week with info I'd printed off the internet re iliopsoas tendon weakness/inflammation. Now I know it's always difficult to see a 'medic' with info you've gleaned yourself but I've never been backwards in coming forwards - if you know what I mean! After a bit of discussion he got me on the couch and started prodding around the groin area - where I have most pain. he found a few very tender areas. he admitted it looked as if my iliac muscle was inflamed. One of the exercises he'd given me was all wrong for this and was making it worse!!!
He showed me how to massage it myself, which I've been doing for 5 minutes twice a day and it's soooo much better already.
According to the internet this is quite rare but it usually shows up later rather than sooner - I'm 15 weeks post op. However, when I talked to my brother about it he said he had the same thing 7 months post op!! One of the classic signs is pain getting into or out of a car- when you put one leg in/out first. I just can't do that, it's too painful.
And then my reply back-------
FWIW it will take about 3 to 4 weeks to have that Psoas muscle/tendons heal. IF after about 2 months it doesn't get any better you will most likely need a small surgery. I went from tendonitis to tendonosis (and you can look up tendonosis) of my IT band. Thankfully the THR totally fixed that, and that was a huge relief as my IT Band tendonosis caused me more pain than my bad hip. Please please take very good care of your psoas muscle so that it does nto beocme permenent. I didn't with my IT band and I suffered for 3 years, I was basically handicapped because of it.
My phyical therapist is the one who about 2 weeks in after my surgery told me it was my psoas muscle, he went and felt for it. He knew. When we had our THR they are moving that leg around in positions it never normally goes when they are dislocating the hip, this is what causes Iliopsoas Tendinitis. If you think of it this way it kind of makes sense doesn't it? Lay down rather than sit, lay around for a month and hope like Hell it heals.  If you have to get into and out of a car, wear pants and lift your leg by pulling up on your pants with your arms so as not to aggravate that muscle. Don't do anything that aggravates that muscle, pray that it heals. If after 2 months it never does heal go back to the orthopedic surgeon and ask for a small surgery to repair. Trust me you do NOT want to suffer with tendonosis all your life, it will handicap you. It is orthepedic surgeon who treat your tendons also. tendons and bones work together so that kind of makes sense to me.

"well coming up for 9 weeks post op, have to say all that bothered me was the muscle contraction on my operated side which was extremely painful, thankfully that has lessened considerably,  thanks to the exercises and the rubber inflated wedge cushion for the car. No problems with the wound or scar that others seem to have. In fact nothing to moan about except being a little stiff in the mornings and I still need my stick otherwise I waddle. I've been told that's because I'm not weight bearing yet. I'm going to bed tonight feeling really positive and thankful that things have gone so well, the sleepless nights and sitting up in the chair for half the night are in the past. Dare I say that I'm even getting used to sleeping on my back, never thought that would happen.
i hope everyone else's recovery improves and that you all start to sleep well and be able to get on with your lives. Take care all x

"Exactly 2 years ago I had a hip replacement and have had ongoing problems since then, groin, thigh and buttock pain mostly. I have had a range of diagnostic checks, scans aspirations, cortisone injections but nothing conclusive. I have just heard the latest injection is in 8 weeks time with no follow up appointment available at present.The appointment I had for next week has been cancelled. There are such long gaps between the appointments and quality of life seems to be affected.
I am now considering seeing my present surgeon privately and would welcome the views of anyone who has transferred from NHS to private care. Thank you

"i am a disabled 53 year old and fell and broke my hip a week ago. I was discharged from hospital a few days ago as physio couldnt really do much more for me as i have limited mobility as it is. I know swelling in the thigh is normal but since being home my foot has really become swollen and its scaring the hell out of me. I am injecting myself every night to help prevent blood clots and although my foot is extremely swollen it is not hot to touch but im worrying. I try to move as much as i can through the day but finding it hard because of my disability so have been sitting a lot with foot on floor. This does cause my leg to become very uncomfortable as the pressure on the thigh and dangling foot is constant. I dont know what im doing wrong as i have had to put cushions on my sofa otherwise i cannot pull myself up safely to use my rollator. please can someone help me as im really worried about why has my foot become so swollen.
Thanks

"So 8 weeks post op. My anterior knee pain is still there. MRI results now show moderate arthritis even though I had NO pain in my knee prior to surgery. Saw my surgeon yesterday. I let him shoot me up with cortisone in my knee, hurt like hell with multiple sticks. Today my pain is still there.
Anyone else have this happen to them. My patella feels like it is not attached? Does arthritis in the knee feel like arthritis in the hips? I am starting to feel very hopeless now.

"So I am coming up on 6 months since my right THR . As I have said before my recovery couldn't have gone any better as far as i can tell however there are a few things that although i thought I was back to full strength and fitness i just wasnt quite there for quite a while. I started tentative running/light jogging again after week 4, yes maybe somewhat churlish, and yes understand the risks . But i progressed steadily back up to my 10k norm but this was definitely taking more out of me than before surgery . It wasnt until about 4 weeks ago I felt that I could progress to further distances and did a 16k run and then a half marathon distance Saturday past . It felt great to actually push harder and longer than I have ever done . At no stage was my hip sore then or since mind you my feet and calfs were a bit tender. In essence be kind to yourself the journey will take a lot out of you but there is light and the end of the tunnel .

"So I am now 8 weeks post op with pain still in the left anterior knee. and can't weight bear on my left leg. Now my new right hip is bothering my leg. Had no pain prior to the surgery at all. Onset was almost immediately but severe pain started four days post op. Was told it was normal after the surgery for the hip to get in alignment. I had an MRI two weeks ago and suddenly my surgeon says I have moderate arthritis. Three weeks ago I only had mild arthritis. I still think my left was over manipulated in the OR during the procedure. He states there are no tears. He wants to see me tomorrow to shoot me with cortisone which is risky. I don't know what to do. My right hip was done last January with no issues at all. Any suggestion. I have Kaiser insurance so I can't go out of network.

"Hi, I had my THR seven weeks ago and am doing pretty much as good as it gets, or normal, whatever that is. However, after I've been walking a while, maybe a mile or two - which feels great, I find afterwards there's a sort of tugging, pulling feeling behind the scar, and this feels even worse when I sit down. Is this normal? I'm quite a light weight at just 7 stone so imagine my muscles are near the surface and less protected than someone a healthier size, but just wondered if anyone else has this?

He surprised me by saying he found it easier to get over than the original op. I know it is a much more complicated operation for the surgeon and that it takes far longer second time around so I assumed the recovery was far more difficult as well. Has anyone been through a revision? I would love to believe that it is no harder than the original operation but I am a bit suspicious.

I'm just wondering if there are any other people on this forum who are a similar age and would give me any advice for her?

I had my left hip replaced in 2017, since then I have had continuous pain in the groin area, my consultant put me in for m.r.i scans, bone scan, cortisone injections all which came back negative,
I am now on the waiting list to have a ct scan, I mentioned to my consultant that all the previous scans ,x Ray's, etc have all shown negative results, what's the chances a ct scan will be any different , I asked him if that was the case then what else could it be, he mentioned it could now be that the ball in the socket may need realignment.
My question is, has anybody else experienced this and what was there outcome, I have changed my car from manual to auto because I cannot lift my leg up when in certain positions, I struggle going up stairs but not coming down, cannot lift my leg to put socks , shoes ,underwear on etc.
If I have to have surgery again, is it a simple procedure or is it a case of removing part or full hip.
Any help and information would be most welcome.

"Hi all, so it's Dec 27th and I had my right hip replaced 2 weeks ago and just wanted to post my positive experience of the last fortnight.
I'm 43 and walk the dog twice a day, and cycle to work every day. The docs said that due to how active I am, my fitness had helped keep the osteo arth in my hip in check. However, over the years the pain kept getting gradually worse and when getting in the car or sitting on the toilet and tying shoe laces got relentlessly painful, enough was enough. After years of trying different things, incl. an unsuccessful hip block, I came to the realisation that a THR was now on the cards.
My consultant (NHS) put me on the waiting list in July and I got my date of 13th Dec by mid-Nov.
I started to procrastinate, over think and lookup stuff on the internet and got worried about the operation and the potential risks that might occur.
However, my experience has been far, far better than I could have possibly imagined, and if any of you are reading this I hope my story can fill you with some positivity and optimism.
I checked in to hospital on the day at 7am, was getting a spinal anaesthetic at 11am and the next thing I remember is coming round at about 2pm with the operation done and dusted. I was soooo relieved, as I didn't want to hear, feel, see, smell anything during the op, but the effects were like a general anaesthetic.
I didn't feel any pain, or feeling in my toes until about 10pm that night, so effective was the anesthetic. The nursing staff were excellent and kept my pain in check with paracetamol and liquid morphine. They warned me early on of not trying to be a 'pain hero' and trying to put on a brave face through any pain. I quickly realised the importance of keeping the pain relief topped up.
I was able to attempt a zimmer frame the next afternoon and shuffled around a bit, then upgrading to crutches. To my joy, this meant the catheter could come out and I shuffled to the toilet myself. This mild shuffling however, did cause quite a bit of pain as a result later that night and I certainly felt the effects and requested more pain relief.
By the Sunday, I managed the stair test, and other physio tests and was allowed to go home by Sunday night. So, only 2 nights in hospital and then home.
Things have been getting steadily better day by day but I am certain that my pre-op fitness has helped....so my biggest advice to anyone thinking of having the op is simple. Get out there walking and cycling/swimming if you can. Keeping the joint moving seems to be excellent advice.
The anti DVT tights are also horrible, itchy and sweaty, but necessary to prevent blood clots. My wife struggles to change them for me every time.
I also didn't realise how important it is to keep the leg elevated throughout the day and up on pillows overnight. On days 4-6 my leg swelled up to elephant like proportions, but after phoning the hospital for guidance they said I had been sitting upright in my chair too much without elevating the leg. Seems obvious in hindsight, but another top tip.
Two weeks post op now strength is slowly returning. I am still using crutches, but gradually getting there.

"Wondered how long any of you have had the temp spacer in? I had bad infection in hip replacement, had it removed, spacer put in 19 months ago. I never was at a point that I wasn't in pain. Doc said the longer I kept it in, and kept infection away, the better it would be. He just said a month ago that I can now have the revision surgery when I'm ready. After so many problems, I'm reluctant. But also have increasing pain, as well as the feeling of a ""plank"" in my thigh. Also have back problems, and just started having pain in left hip and thigh, which chiropractor said is femoral nerve pain. Back surgeon told me well over a year ago that I would eventually need more back surgery. (Had bone spurs removed just a month before I had to have the hip replacement removed.) Walking is getting more painful; can't walk more than 5 minutes before sitting down.

I had my last replacement 18 months ago with virtually no pain, just the odd paracetamolThis time the pain is a lot worse bu not unmanageable , my ability to walk is worse but i only need 1 stick, it just shows how different each surgery for the same complaint can be .Another factor can be the operating table. My last surgeon had a special table especially for the anterior approach so ive a feeling this made it easier. My surgeon this time did warn me of the disadvantage as he did not have the table so more pulling around. I was awake all the way through which as a retired nhs employee was what i wanted we have to remember that every surgical pain is different

"hello everyone I'm here to give u an update so I had my 5th hip surgery on dec 3rd which was the 2nd revison I had one revision dec 18th 2018 as well. I must say I dont think I could go through this anymore this was the worst surgery ever and intense pain I got a massive bruise on the side of my hip which was weird cause I never bruised with any of my surgerys. I have 47 staples they did an anterior approch and I can definitely say I can feel everything even the implant it's so much pressure and I found out through physio in my town where I live I got to see my xrays on her computer and it shows the stem part is thinner and I have 2 wires holding it place. why didnt the surgeon tell me anything I had the surgery at 8am dec 3rd and left the next day cause I wanted to be home in my own bed. but they did xrays first thing in the morning then physio then home,remind me next time to bring pain meds with me for the ride home as I live 2 hrs from regina sask canada dr said if I pass physio I can go home which I did by the way hospital food is yucky. so during my first week home the pain has been unbearable tons of ice pain meds. this week isnt as bad as last week. but I sure hope ths is it till I'm a senior I'm only 37.

"Hi All. Had a left THR posterior in the UK on 12th Sept . After being told i was too young, you might need another in 15 yrs,you're not stting here crying in pain etc by 3 consultants over 4 years , the last one even referred m e back to Physio !! I took matters into my own hands , picked my hospital and surgeon , and got referred through my doctor. Within one minute of my consultation he said "" Your hips shot at , you need surgery""! At last someone had listened to me . That was on the 23rd Aug.
Of course i was nervous leading up to the day but found lots of very helpful info on here.
For anyone waiting for surgery and worried all i can say is there is no need to be at all. The ""dreaded"" spinal was completly painless and as i opted for full sedation i knew nothing at all until i woke in recovery, fully awake, no pain, no nausea , and chatting to staff the same as i was before surgery. I had op at 9.00am ,was back on the Ward at 11.30 ,and was tucking into my lunch at 11.50. I had to pinch myself that i felt so alert and well.
I stayed in hospital for 2 days where i was looked after fantastically well. The pain relief meds did their job and was up and about doing the usual exercises in preparation for going home. The only negative experience i had was the fact my bladder didnt ""wake"" up quickly enough so had to have a catheter, I would rather have 20 spinals than having one of those again!!!!! As you find out though with this surgery, everything is temporary and it was a great relief when it was removed 24hrs later!
My time at home has been different of course since surgery but everything you encounter, raised toilet seats, using the grabber and other devices, remembering your hip restrictions , doing exercises and building up walking gently isnt really a problem or burden. Take everything slowly and steadily and you soon get into a routine. Accept the fact that sleeping on your back can be a challenge but it isnt for ever. I got severe heel pain for the first few nights so now i have a very soft pillow under my calfs so my feet dangle over the edge of the pillow and not in contact with the bed sheets, no problems since. My thigh and knee did bruise and swell but ice packs do help and it has reduced by 80% .
This is the day i discard the TED stockings which have been fairly comfortable to be honest. Ive been advised to continue to walk with two crutches outside for the full 12 wks to avoid getting a limp and im now doing 2 miles a day.
it really is life changing surgery and im continuing to be positive going forward and im really enjoying the recovery process. Ive had no pain since surgery, i stopped the pain relief after 2 weeks and all i get now is muscle stiffness which i take as a good feeling that my ""chicken leg"" is slowly getting back to normal.
Thank you for reading

"I realize all of us are different. Our recoveries will be different, different type of surgeries, different doctors recommendations. I am very thankful I was in somewhat of good physical shape before my hip replacement. Mine was not a scheduled replacement but one due to a broken femur and hip I had in a bicycle crash. I crashed at 8:30am on Saturday morning, had a new hip by 9am the next day and was home the following day by 3:30pm.
I'm 67 years old and a cyclist.
I had follow up appointments at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. At my last appointment the doctor told me he did not need to see me for a year from that appointment day, not the surgery day. So the next time I see him it will be a year and three months since surgery? Is that weird?
I followed a PT's advice that is also a young cyclist. I have not had severe pain since I started riding 20-28 miles per ride, 3-4 times per week. I do NOT stand up to climb hills nor do I try any sprinting just an easy fast spinning cadence. I do not try to push the larger gear and don't hesitate to down shift IF I feel I have to exert some effort. All of that is for the few cyclist I see on this forum.
Cold weather and sitting longer than 20 minutes has been my biggest problem. I can still be quite sore when I get up if I have sat at the computer too long or on the couch watching a game/movie. Yet after a night of sleep that soreness is gone completely. When I say cold weather I only mean in the 40's early morning. I live at 4,500' elevation in the high desert of Arizona.
Now that I have been reading about ""resurfacing"" with people that run, I am a little concerned about what my cycling will do longterm. Although in my booklet given to me the day before surgery ... running was prohibited as a future activity, cycling was NOT. In fact my PT friend told me the day of surgery that I could be back on the bike within a month but I waited a month longer.
I did add protein supplements to my diet after surgery as well as Collagen w/peptides based on a recommendation from a friend that had a knee replacement. A week after taking the Collagen my surgical side leg, ankle and foot returned to normal size after being swollen twice as large as my good side leg. I had read that swelling could last up to two months after surgery. I'm not sure if it was the supplement or just a coincidence.
I am still very very cautious when getting in and out of my car and truck. I am very cautious when riding my bike over small rocks/sand at intersections since that is what took my bike from under me, not falling more than 2' and breaking my femur toward the hips socket. I also still get in bed the same way the PT taught me the day I left the hospital. I am still aware of my movements even if they are back to normal.
For those of you that have had a rough time recovering, I feel your pain. I remember the first morning I was home walking with a walker, feeling like I would never return to where I was physically. That is a terrible feeling. All I can suggest is follow your doctors orders, take one day at a time and remember each and every day you can have small amounts of improvement that you will not realize until the good changes further down the calendar.
Final question ... is cycling going to be like running where I will need a ""resurface"" later on? My doctor was thrilled I was back riding my bike and never mentioned anything like ""resurfacing"" later on or even the consequences of bike riding after a hip replacement.

I read that the antibiotics could have caused this.  I've been researching what I can do to reestablish good gut bacteria  after taking antibiotics.  One of the recommendations is to take probiotics.  It seems like a good idea and could help get the little guys going quicker in my stomach. 
 My question is;  could probiotics and  yogurts somehow get in the bloodstream and take up residence in my replacement?  I will ask my doctor, but I'm curious if anyone has heard of any problems with taking probiotics?
 
 Thanks!
 
 Jim

"HI, this is my first post and wonder if anyone can reassure me? I had a THR 3 weeks ago and apart from the normal pain, tiredness etc., have been okay .... except for one thing.... my digestion. I'm having some good days, even pottering with one or even no crutches - but my stomach is awful. I'm not really taking much medication now, the occasional paracetamol, but some days I'm so nauseous and needing the loo for funny bits of loose poo followed by retching and feeling awful.
Is this normal or is something seriously wrong with me? Today is a bad day and I can't eat a thing. I simply don't know how best to help myself. Any thoughts much appreciated - thanks. Marianne

X- ray showed the hip replacement is perfect. Surgeon checked my back and pushed and pulled my about, no pain in my back. The surgeon is sending my for a mri and he feel it is my spine, not the hip. i'm confused. i have no back pain, the pain is in the hip area. i spend my days like a very old lady, if i go shopping, the next day i have to rest up.

"Hi Everyone,
Firstly, I'd just like to say how incredibly helpful and supportive I have found this forum.
I am 2 weeks post THR today and yesterday returned to the hospital for my wound check. The nurse removed my waterproof dressing and was pleased with how the incision is healing. I had dissolvable stitches and glue. The nurse applied about 11 steri-stripes to the wound and said I would need to leave these in place for up to 5 days, but if they began to come away after 4 days I shouldn't worry. Well, it's only just been over 24hrs since the Steri-strips have been applied and up to 75% of them have already fallen off! I think it's due to the sliding on and off bed motion. Had anybody else had a similar issue and if so what action did they take please? I think I may call the hospital in the morning to seek their advice. I'm pretty sure my local chemist stocks Steri-strips, so I should be able to pick some up myself and apply if necessary. Many thanks.

No real pain and I am not taking painkillers. I was worried I might have loose part so I went right in for an xray and will talk to my family doctor tomorrow morning.
I don't feel I did anything to go past 90 degrees or strain the hip but I was a bit cold and not warmed up yet.

"Hi,
I had my THR nearly 4 years ago now at the age of 30. Took me about 12 months to really start to feel the benefits, but after a year I was made up!
4 years on and sharp pains are back in my hip. Seems to be worse every time I stand and walk from sitting and sometimes walking down the stairs.
I also suffer with arthritis of the spine and knees and still adamant one operated leg is longer than the other!
I have had another child since who is 1 and been very active running round after him and my other two young children.
I am thinking that my hip couldn't of loosened after 4 years could it?
Back on the strong meds to help me sleep as pain wakes me up through the night, which I'm gutted as was on them for many years before the op. I do try and exercise, stretch and do yoga from home, but the sharp pains when I move recently is making it difficult.
Anyone had a THR at a younger age, been active and come into sudden pain?
Not sure what is going on and already feel that doctors fob me off when I go with pain with my knees and back because of my age so dont like going to much.
I am back at the point that I cant ignore the pain any longer as once again it's starting to put a real strain on daily activities
Thanks in advance guys.

"I had my RTHR on Monday 23rd September. It was required because years of running up to ultra marathon distances had removed the cartilage from the joint, so leaving bone on bone. First became noticeable 6 years ago when hip started to buckle while running and I spent a lot of time with physios, orthopaedic consultants and in the gym. Message was: 塗old back until pain is unbearable. That time came earlier this year. I am 59, cycle 200 plus miles a week, gym for upper body (and hip stability), and do laughable attempts at yoga poses once a week. Operation funded by NHS in UK, intrusive, posterior, spinal block with sedative. Latter was obviously insufficient so I woke up in the middle of the operation. It sounded like I was in a busy blacksmith痴 forge where the grinding machine was vying with the hammers for attention. This soundtrack was interrupted by silence, the anesthetist saying to me 殿re you there? and after my grunt of acknowledgement, the next thing I knew I was in the recovery room. The surgeon was delighted: 土ou can go home tomorrow (two nights scheduled), I could bend, bridge (even on bad leg only), do all exercises, and walk a little with crutches. And a little bit of understandable pain in maneuvering. All was going swimmingly. Sleep fitful, waking often but not an issue.
Day 2. A 4am wake up for a strong painkiller. 90 minutes later, I sat up, started sweating profusely, almost passed out. Cue oxygen mask then the shivers. A low level feeling of queasiness gave way to retching. Med to deal with nausea returned me to the queasiness. A day of forced eating without any pleasure, some walking successfully dealt with, dozing a lot, textbook exercises, queasiness and real pain getting the leg in place when moving around, particularly from sitting on the bedside to prone. All of which convinced me to reject the offered ride home. Sleep periods longer than night 1 but lots of interruptions.
Day 3. Still queasy, still sore to move. Walking, still with crutches, getting slowly easier. A lecture from ward doctor on managing pain, based on facial contortions while walking (兎xcuse me, your meds aren稚 removing the pain). And then home. Possibly the worst pain I have known getting leg into car. And every bend and bump on the way home really uncomfortable. Rest of day mainly recumbent, dozing and not too bad. 250m walk and exercises. Strong painkiller (same as Day 2 morning) with dinner. Waves of nausea, really awful. Decision: ibuprofen and paracetamol only for me from here on. First negotiation of really narrow steep typical English stairs (bannister and opposite hand crutch), with my wife hovering anxiously two steps behind. Sleep still fitful but again longer intervals; first venture to lying on my side  pillow between legs  a success. Note to self  my wife痴 done everything for me. Care is a non negotiable.
Day 4. Completely wiped out after showering, getting dressed, exercises (first successful leg raise possibly 1mm), breakfast. Still sore maneuvering leg. Still queasy but maybe food tastes ok, or not  After long doze, first trip downstairs with wife痴 hand on chest mainly preventing any downward movement (again bannister and crutch in opposite hand). Other than walking and exercises, a lot of time prone on sofa. Sleep intervals improved again.
Day 5. Getting ready is somehow easier but difficult to quantify. Morning walk combined with trip to coffee shop. Getting into car pretty interesting. How much weight may your arms bear to get leg in? Queasiness overcame desire for that second cappuccino. First successful indoor sortie on one crutch and solo ascent of stairs. Reasonable increase in walk distance, one of the crutches now discarded. And then at 10pm in bed  pow! the mist cleared. As if the second half of my brain suddenly engaged and issues of concentration like not wanting to read a serious word evaporated. Downside that brain doesn稚 want to allow body to sleep. Yoga breathing drags brain to sleep after some hours. Much less sleep but somehow more refreshing despite minor hot flushes?
Day 6. Another day another coffee shop but only after morning exercise yielded a turn onto stomach, a wobbly plank (on bed) and a bad leg lifted about 0.5mm for a millisecond. Getting into car still so so and from sitting onto bed occasionally challenging. Suddenly food tastes ok, or even nice. Able to cut salad for lunch of 7 people, ferrying to and from fridge crutch in one hand. And, miracle of miracles  after a nervous but much planned approach to the mechanics of mounting - 15 min on the gym痴 exercise bike. Then first solo descent of stairs. Another night requiring a lot of breathing exercises to still that brain, and hot spells during sleep.
Day 7. More of the same really. First (unintended) solo walk. Can balance on bad leg in exercises. Now allowed by wife to navigate the house independently. 20 minutes on exercise bike. First item picked up off floor  bad leg carefully trailing like a tail. Still some discomfort getting that leg onto the bed and into the car. Still really careful turning and setting off after standing up. First really good sound sleep.
One final point without any gory detail  I should have taken the laxative they offered in hospital

"Hi. I had THR (right hip )2.5 years ago due to arthritis and depleted cartilage and I've regretted my decision every day since!. I am in a lot of pain and discomfort and still cannot comfortably lie on that side. I have had a steroid injection on two occasions since, one by guided ultrasound..to no avail. No improvement whatsoever! X-rays taken indicated all was fine but MRI showed inflammation at site of surgery. Am experiencing a lot of lower back pain past few months, in addition to hip pain/soreness aggravated by standing or weight-bearing eg a 3L carton of milk is too much and am awaiting appt for MRI on my spine. So as you can imagine, I personally would not recommend you have surgery unless absolutely necessary..and I would suggest to delay it for as long as possible, within reason, esp since you would most likely need it again, depending on life span of prosthesis. Thats my novel! Best of luck in whatever you decide to do.

However, my operated side seems quite significantly longer now
so much so that if I weight bear on my ""bad"" side, my good side foot is off the floor! I pointed this out to my district nurse today and she said she would tell my surgeon. Has anyone else experienced this, and does it rectify itself over time?

"Hi, I'm after some guidance and opinions for those of you pre and post op. I'm 43 and awaiting my date for op. I have been trying to delay having a THR as long as I can, I really wanted to be sure there were no other other options.
The thing I'm battling with inside is when is enough pain and stiffness enough. Saw my surgeon yesterday and he, like all the other consultants and Dr's I've seen, didn't want to offer an opinion about whether he agrees now is the right time. Everyone keeps saying I'm younger than most who need THR but it almost feels like they're subtley saying ' why are you in here? '.
The pain from my hip depends on how I'm standing or sitting, so there are certain positions where I feel very little or no pain. but I've realised over the years I'm not putting my body in those really painful positions very much. So, in my head I keep thinking I can somehow persevere and maybe I should be manning-up to leave a THR as long as I can.
Anyone else gone through this, particularly the absence of anyone professional actually giving their candid, honest opinion?

"I had an unexpected total hip replacement last Sunday morning 7am. I was home Monday at 4pm. Sunday night, the night of surgery, I noticed my left leg was twitching, the non-surgical side. I figured the nerves must be coming out of surgery. The past two nights Day 6 & 7 post op, my right leg is now twitching a lot at night as I try to sleep. I had a total hip replacement on the right side.
I do the ankle pump, heel slides, apply ice, stand straight up with walker to stretch ... lay back down and soon afterward the leg will twitch again. No pain involved. Just bothersome enough that I can't sleep.
Any experience? What's the solution if there is one? How long does this last?

"Hello, I'm new to this forum, don't know if this topic has been posted before.
I had osteonecrosis in my hips 25 years ago due to prednisone prescribed for a rheumatic illness, probably Lupus or polymyositis. Since then my hips had progressively worsen. In he last year the pain has increased to barely tolerable levels, my range of motion has decreased to less than 10ｰ and the most recent development is a sudden sharp, flash pain in the hip joint, which makes either my left or right leg (sometimes both) to suddenly ""give out,"" under me as if a switch turned them off, losing all muscle strength in an instant.
I don't know how doctors call this. I rule out any spinal nerve injury, or pinched nerves, since this happen only when I walk or overuse my damaged hip joints. The only recommendation from my doctor is to refrain from walking or have an operation. I can't have an operation now and can't stop walking, I live alone and have nobody to do things for me.
My question is, what causes this, and what can I do, what therapy, or exercise?
Thanks for your help.

I had FAI repair, tendon repair, torn labrum repair and a 5mm x 5mm cartilage defect down to the bone and a microfracture was done for that. Any advice appreciated. I know the cartilage defect is quite small so I'm thinking a replacement now is premature?

"hi all, new to the page but im desperate for some advice from someone who may be able to help. This is probably going go be a long post so please bare with me.
I was diagnosed with congenital hip dysplasia at 8 months old. I had my first surgery at 1 year old and have had 14 surgeries over the years. 3 years ago at the age of 20, (making me 23 years old now) I had a left total hip replacement and reconstruction, it took 9.5 hours and was an incredibly complex surgery. Sadly the surgery was not a success and I have finally been put back on the surgery list to remove the replacement, and redo it with several alterations.
so, 1 week after being put on the waiting list, i discovered I was pregnant, im only 7 weeks so early days but obviously, ill not be able to have my surgery anymore. So this is where the advice comes in.
I suffer from osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, joint hypermobility syndrome, TMJ, Fibromyalgia, planter fasciitis, trapped nerves and obviously all these conditions cause excruciating chronic pain and mobility issues. The hip replacement was supposed to be a little bit of a life line for pain issues.
My real question is, is there anyone here that has been through pregnancy with any of these conditions? how did you cope? what was the chronic pain like? did your hip replacement cause any issues during labour, and most importantly did any mothers who have/had hip dysplasia, did you baby have it too? this terrifies me the most because id hate to put a child through what iv been through. I dont really know how many of you here will be able to help, but im finding it incredibly difficult to find any videos, blogs, pages from mams/mams to be who are disabled and have similar conditions to me. I guess I just want some clarity on what may be to come and how you coped during your pregnancy with all the added extras

The surgery went well and the initial pain was gone. Since then though I can't lift my leg up without help. The pain is bad in my leg when I try. Also feels like the muscle is not there to lift it. Is that something that will eventually go away. It's been over a year and a half.

However for a about the last three months i've been having pain in my replaced hip, not constantly, but when it happens its very painful - reminds me of the pain before the op. It does ease off so i don't know if this is normal and just me overdoing it or do i need to see someone? if so who? do i go to my gp or contact the hip clinic?

Really trying to evenly weight bear. Trying to do squats every day along with physio exercises. She tells me that my muscle is very weak around the thigh from non use for ages due to pain and operation of course.
My only prob is when I briefly try to walk without crutches I really struggle to get going from my bad leg. She advised to just on occasion lose the crutches briefly at home.
Has anyone any advice on how to set off a bit more evenly? perhaps its just time thanks so so much

"IN the last year ive had a horrible time , had a infection from a revision surgery 3.5 yrs ago which was finally found march last year after alot of pushing by me to find out why i was in so much pain . July 2018 had the first of the two phase hip surgeries with pick line with antibiotics was done , i had a few issues with recovery . Low blood pressure 6 hour recovery after a 5/6 hr operation , i went home 5 days later . Once home i was all good but around the 2 week mark i felt movement then bang i dislocated ( the most painful thing i,ve ever experienced ) then 5 days after that it went again ! this was horrific i never felt so scared , i could hardly walk needed help to shower/ get dressed / get in and out of bed in which i was very reluctant to do as was terrified it was going to come out . No one knew what to do or help , the surgeon put me in hip brace for a month ( pain was well up there ) .Once the infection had gone i then went in to have 2nd stage hip replacement with custom cup , had 8 screws put in as my abscaptular area was munted from previous op . So another big surgery and recovery , blood pressure dropped to a dangerous level and was put in hdu to try bring it back up . Had in both surgeries 2/3 bags of blood , left hospital after 5 days . Was coming along really well good pain levels , but after around a month it dislocated again ! hip brace again . By this stage i had ptsd and was seeing a phycologist i had anxiety with everything i did , and very weak . I finally reached the 3 month stage , thought id be all ok went away for the weekend for the first time in months and would you believe it dislocated again ! I can,t tell you how that just ruined me . The surgeon sent me for a CT scan and saw i had alot of muscle damage from infection and surgeries and that he would try stop it coming out so another surgery two weeks later . So far still in, post op 4.5 months but i still have pain in groin / buttocks / outside of knee and above ankle , also swelling in these areas ? I walk pretty good but standing or sitting to long i get sore or if i do to much , which is not alot as still being careful . What do you think this could be ? I walk every day and do my exercisers , I am 53 years old , I have in my 40 s had two hip replacements left and right with no problems with those , so I know what sort of pain to deal with after ops . I feel like the medical system has failed me and that they do not listen to me , all the times i said i was sore or felt things were not right i was right .

have posted on here a fair few times and everyone has been so kind and helpful, but this recently this has been preying on my mind. I have had a THR due to arthritis. A friend due to a fall off a segway, (which was previously pinned etc till bone failed and replacement essential) also had a THR Recently friend said to me that I should not be limping. and to be fair I don't always, (my op 1/2/19) hers op before christmas. However, due to having a slightly larger muscle mass and that I could not move as freely as I would have liked, plus going back to work, I feel that at times I do not walk as freely as she does. such as not being able to walk without a limp like she does. When I do stretch it helps but do not always get the time. So sorry if long winded, but at times I feel like that I am getting there and then I get this. I think also that I wear ballerina type shoes for a change to bulky shoes, have hardly wore sandals as well.

I could walk fine without aids after less than 3 weeks, up to 2 miles a day, and driving was fine after 4 weeks. I followed all the restrictions diligently for the 6 weeks that the hospital had advised, and wasn't getting much pain at all. In short, I was feeling pretty good. But in the last couple of days, driving has become really painful. I get pain down the outside of my thigh, and then through the inner thigh. Going round bends, especially roundabouts, is really bad. Today I had to abandon a trip and come home after a few miles. When I get out of the car and walk around, the pain goes away. I'm really worried about this. Could I have damaged something? My follow up with the surgeon is still 6 weeks away.

"I am quite a fit 52y old male and I had my THR on 25th July . I must admit there is such a variance of ages and experiences and I have struggled to find information on how much exercise etc you can do if you feel like it . All I can find is what not to do etc but I feel like a bit of a charlatan as I feel quite good and wanted to get back to running .Perhaps it's the calm before storm! My experience so far in brief ,I got out of hospital within 28 hrs of admission . I was able to walk with a walking stick no crutches and do all the exercises quite easily. I was able to go up and down the flights of stairs without any issue and was able to walk a few km within 4 days. I did notice that I needed a nap in the middle of day for first week but since then no issues. I ditched the walking stick after 10 days and admit i could have done this sooner but wife kept me grounded lol . Since then I have been out on road bike a few times for 5k rides and there was some trepidation as I felt that the saddle was pushing my hip out. After some anatomical googling I see this was not the case and just my ass sore on the saddle . Biggest issue is the feeling of a ball below the surface of the wound and sitting on it . I have had all dressings off for some time and wound healing nicely. I am now starting to do some weights in my garage and now able to do body weight squats . I did a fast walk on my running machine the other day and ohh I so wanted to just run for 100m but I was a bit scared .

"i am having a hip replacement in a couple of weeks. I am trying to stay positive and tell myself this is a good choice. I fell down some stairs about 3 or 4 yrs ago. My hip is full of arthritis and it is painful to walk. i have worked for 2 years in the schools but found it was too hard to climb the stairs so i had to stop working at 1 particular school because i could not keep up with the students. They were really busy kids. I also found that i could not help the students in some of their classes such as gym. I cannot sit on the floor or play sports with them.
I know I need to do this surgery but so scared of getting it done. i am scared of the unknown. Will I survive surgery??? Will i regret getting this done??? Will I hear anything during surgery??? I know if I do not get this done i will be able to walk and may end up in a wheelchair. I cannot bend down to tie my shoes, cut my toenails, put socks on, etc. My hip is just getting worse. I know my fears and anxiety may not be realistic maybe but they are my fears.

"Hello Hippies!
Thank you for all the help you gave me before Mum had her op! Can I ask you to share your experience post op with swollen foot on the operated leg?
The operated leg foot can swell as much as twice it's size. The un-operated leg foot is fine.
Have any of you also experienced the same?
She's almost 4 weeks post-op. Is wearing compression socks. Also having injections daily for blood thinning as she's allergic to asprin and previously had a DVT after another op.
The rest of her operated leg doesn't swell - nor her groin area etc. It's just her foot. She's healed nicely and takes paracetemol first thing in the morning and last thing at night because otherwise it gets a bit ""twingy"" but not ""ouchie"".
Was only given a zimmer when she left. Is walking around her flat lots with it, but now this last week, is walking short distances without it more and more. I've stopped nagging her to use the zimmer based on experiences from others on this forum. I was initially paranoid getting her always to use the zimmer, but as she can walk - and when she does walk reminds herself to walk up straight ... my brother and I have stopped nagging her and may be wrong thinking that if she can do it safely - let her do it. Also taught her to use the furniture etc to balance when she suddenly lacks confidence because she realises she's left it behind.
My brother does exercises each day with her ... we call them ""ballerina exercises"" as she uses the end of her bed as a bar. And she does a walk outside (with the zimmer) around her complex once a day but gets tired if we try and push her to do more. I'm a bit worried as I'd hoped she'd be up and out there by now, but she says the zimmer frame is only meant for inside and is really hard to use when she's outside.
For this reason, I've asked for physio to come to her and get her walking outside with the appropriate equipment. It'll be another week before they can fit her in.
I was thinking maybe this was why her foot was swelling but my brother - who each night comes to take off her compression socks, soak her feet, put on moisturizer E45, then put the clean compression socks on, says that each day varies with the swelling and that sometimes it's been good but we can't work out why that should be.
Thank you Hippies in advance for your knowledge and experience to help us.
Oh, and by the way ... yeah .. it was a bit rubbish for her ... she was in hospital for 2 weeks - post op delerium, low sodium and a urine infection ... she was so glad that she was able to go home!
All the best to you all whatever stage of your journey.

"the area around my scar has remained swollen, but I also have a lot of swelling on the back of my thigh, side of my hip and bottom, despite doing all the exercises and physio. as a result the pressure causes pain on my muscles when sitting and lying on my back or operated side. walking is more and more painful so I have to remain on crutches as the pressure of the swelling causes me to limp. my mri showed bursitis in a number of areas, but the orthopaedic team are unwilling to advise anything other than wait. I am now doing less exercise than at 10 weeks as I am I am in so much pain. I cannot take anti inflammatories due to other drugs. I see from reading about bursitis that steroid injections are a route, but the whole surgical site is so painful I cannot even wear normal trousers yet. Has anyone had this experience and if so how did you tackle it? My good hip is now so painful from taking the brunt it keeps me awake too. Thanks for any input you can give.

"Hi there! So in November of 2018, I had my labrum repaired along with a few other things fixed while he was in there. I have gone through years of therapy before and after my surgery. After surgery, I had dry needling done to help with intense muscle tightness. Eventually, everything calmed down and slowly I was cleared to play soccer again. My first soccer tournament back was last weekend. The first few minutes I was in, I was on fire. Then I took a wrong step, a girl hit me from behind, and I felt everything inside my hip move out of place and grind. (keep in mind I am about to be a senior in high school) After this I don't remember what happened except that I ended up at the hospital. I was supposed to leave for band camp on Monday but that didn't happen. Now I am waiting and hoping that insurance will cover another MRI but one that doesn't need contrast because I had a reaction to the contrast last time. I am trying to stay positive. Can someone help?

"Hi all! I'm new to this community after searching for possible answers fir this horrid thigh pain, and thought I'd see if anyone dealt with anything similar.
BACKSTORY: At age 25 I was diagnosed with AVN in both hips following a pregnancy where I needed to have steroids to treat an especially severe case of hyperemesis gravidarum. Had my first THR 3 weeks after finally being diagnosed, and after going through another pregnancy on a collapsed hip joint (fun times!)... 2 weeks post op I unfortunately got an infection in the joint. Surgeon did a washout and months of antibiotics, which needed adjusted sooo many times due to reactions. After 3 years I was still in pain (all pretty much groin pain), and found a new surgeon who did a total revision and said it was just never done properly to begin with and was very loose even though it didn't show on xrays. That hip is now doing amazing!
This new surgeon did a full workup on the other hip as well hoping to do a core decompression to try and save the hip, but it had progressed and was no longer salvageable, so he did a THR in november. All seemed to be going well with recovery, pain was almost gone and I returned to work after 4 months. Around month 5 it all changed. I started having these sharp, intense pains in my mid-thigh that would radiate to my knee, mostly when taking my weight back off the leg (so during the ""unloading"" phase) if I stood with all my weight on that leg too long, and when walking a further distance.
Now I'm almost 9 months post op and this pain is only getting worse. The sharp pains come more frequently, enough that I cry just thinking about having to walk from one room to another... it's been very debilitating and very frustrating! I have called my surgeon numerous times, but still just ""on the list of people to call for appointments"". My GP did order xrays, which seemed ok, but something is definitely wrong here. I never had this pain before in my other hip even with all the complications I had. I have 4 kids and trying to keep up with them is just not happening. I feel like an awful mother and that my kids have lost some of their childhood helping to look after mommy. I just want my life back, and for this pain to go away.

"I am 71 and fit. I had a right hip replacement in October 2016. All went well. Hip brilliant. Have a ll.7 mm leg length difference for which I wear raises in all my shoes. All went well for about a year then the tendon in my left hip hurt a lot at night and tendonosis was diagnosed. Had lots of physio and it has helped, but still limited as to what I can do and sleep. Cannot sleep on that side. No arthritis in that hip. Could be a bit of wear and tear of the tendon but could be because of walking differently with the leg length difference. The hip was playing up a little on the left before the op. Has this happened to anyone else, and does anyone have any advice please? I am wondering if to go further into orthotics or think about someone who knows about back alignment.

"Hello all,
Some of you may remember me from my postings back in 2015 - I had a total right hip replacement at the age of 44 following a neck of femur break 10 years previous and the development of osteoarthritis.
Well here we are 4 years post op so I thought I would give a brief update.
Overall extremely positive - the vast majority of the time I do not even remember that my hip is artificial. Flexibility and rotation returned to almost match those in my natural remaining hip. Have been pain free for the past 4 years. Amazing.
One thing I have found is that if I sit for an extended period of time I find the hip to be a little stiff upon rising - only lasts for a short time and it doesn't concern me but just thought I would mention it.
I do however have a slight concern with something that has just started happening recently - when I have my leg in certain positions, and sat at a certain height from the floor, then when i rotate the hip back into a legs together position I feel a sharp 'click'. No actual noise but its a very strange feeling and it does feel like something popping back into position. Not been back to the doctors as of yet as I just wanted to see if it went away on its own accord but as of yet it hasn't. Anyone got any ideas?
So overall - very positive and would definitely recommend the op to anyone struggling with pain. The post op recovery is awful (in my experience) but doesn't take that long to start rapidly improving.

"I had my left hip replaced 4 weeks ago -hip is now fine...
When I woke up from surgery I had a terrible pain in my ankle which went away with painkillers. The next day I had no feeling below the knee on my left side. They left it another day in case the spinal block was still lingering but agreed it was sciatic nerve damage. I was in surgery for almost 4 hours which was surprising and they said it was really stiff and hard to get the old hip out. Everyone seems pretty much agreed that the sciatic nerve is stretched and that the feeling should come back. I have a drop foot which makes it difficult to walk normally but the worst thing is the pain. I have a 'pain in the bum' which is sciatic and all down my leg. The parts which are numb to touch bizarrely also hurt. I'm not usually a winger but this is destroying me. On a scale of 1 -10 it's a clear 10. I am on a raft of drugs including tramadol, naproxen, gabapentin and diazapam but nothing is touching it. I've bought a tens machine on advice and that helps a little but because I hurt in so many places its hard to know where to put it -also it hurts in its own way ( I seem to have becomne hypersensitive to touch on that leg)
I'm at my wits end -I haven't slept more than an hour at a time since the operation and really feel I can't go on. The consultant has referred me to a neurologist but they won't see me before 6 weeks as usually it goes away by itself. It's not that I don't think it will recover I do -I have a flicker of movement in my toes which wasn't there a week ago -it's just I can't cope with the pain any more
Anyone got any advice?

. yesterday I'd say I wasnt limping with 1 crutch but today feels like a bigger effort to lift my leg to walk. I dont 3ant to go back to 2 inside if this is how it goes but practice makes better.

I am now looking at my house and seeing crumbs, dust bunnies, weeds, and general grime. I would like to get down on my hands and knees to do the floors and weed the flower beds. But I also have been totally exhausted by 3 or 4 pm. I started iron supplements a few days ago and feel much better. But there is very little medical guidance after this procedure. The advice is to stay active, walk, no PT needed, I couldn't take narcotic pain meds, so I have been getting through on celebrex, but stopped that two days ago with no ill effects. I want to make sure I heal well and would really appreciate feedback on how much is too much after the anterior approach.

"This is a bit of a deep subject for the THR forum - but here goes.
After reading another post, I am wondering if my low Factor 7 (blood clotting) which was found at the revision of my hip replacement following catastrophic failure of the ceramic liner and debris from the failure is linked at all.
I know that Metallosis can affect the liver function, could I have suffered some metallosis, or could the ceramic debris be to blame for the apparent liver cirrhosis which has caused it to not produce normal levels of Factor 7 for blood clotting even with high doses of Vitamin K.
I guess it's going to be something else to ask the blood specialists at the haematology clinic and my surgeon.
By the way this is EXTREMELY rare, I am one of about 65 people in the UK with it, and unlike me most of them were born with the problem.

"Hi folks
I would appreciate some advice about crossing legs...
In the first 6 weeks after my right THR I was warned very strongly against crossing my legs (I guess to avoid thrombosis and/or dislocation). Now I really do want to be able to cross my right leg over my left.
I have a very dry skin which I have to keep well greased. (I壇 been warned not to grease it at all for my operation; when the anaesthetist doing my spinal saw my back he said 土es, you really do have a very dry skin!) A particular problem is my feet, which crack easily and painfully especially in hot weather.
I can easily sit down and lift my left foot onto my right knee, grease the foot thoroughly, and put on a sock to protect it. Not so with the right foot. It痴 hard to lift it that far because the muscles  4.5 months after my op  are still pretty tight. And I can稚 maintain it long enough to deal with my foot even when I do manage to raise it partway. This is about the only movement that I can稚 do yet. I知 fine kneeling, swimming, don稚 even think about using a stick except when hiking (which I have always done) etc.
My physio is very pleased with my recovery and general flexibility and strength so far (so am I). He has given me an exercise to do to gradually improve the stretch. Basically it involves crossing my right leg over the left, above the knee, and holding it in position for 20 seconds, and repeating. To be done both lying down (much easier) and standing.
My only worry is whether there is any dislocation risk. Am I OK to be crossing my legs at this stage in my recovery? I壇 appreciate any thoughts.

"Hi everyone,
I am almost a year post on from my LTHR. Prior to my surgery my pain was manageable, but I had extremely limited range of motion: no internal or external rotation, limited flexion (60 degrees) and negative extension (- 15 degress... meaning I couldn't straighten my leg)... and I walked with a very noticeable limp.
Anyway, my ROM is much improved since the surgery, and most days are minor pain to pain free. I average between 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day (between 7-10KM), and usually feel pretty good. However, I have noticed that on days where I do a lot (like when I hit the 10 KM total walks... or after a single long 6 KM walk) my hip (or more specifically, the muscles around the hip) can feel quite sore and a little stiff the next day. I have read that bone and tissue continues to remodel itself around the implant for up to two years or more, and that it can lead to some soreness.
So I am wondering, for those of you who have had a successful THR and are a couple of years out, do you still get sore/stiff after lots of activity? If not, around how longer after your surgery did this soreness/stiffness stop occurring?
Also, are you completely pain free, or just mostly pain free? Just curious on that one.
Thanks

"**Does anyone from any medical social media websites find that there are many numerous patients who end up in more pain after than before and yet amongst my friends a joint replacement surgery is commonly compared to plastic surgery.
For three replacements one knee and two hips I was never warned of the possibility of being worse after surgery than before.. I was warned about infection which required me having a revision 3 months after the first. and pain now worse than before.
I think this is lacking in a full discussion. This is being hidden and many are in disbelief when it happens and the subject
seems to be hushed up. It is vital that patients are to be fully informed that there is a possibility.that it can happen in many different ways as seen discussed on websites like this.

"Hi Hippies
My Mum is aged 81 and going for her hip op having waited for over 10 months on the UK waiting list.
As a family we're wondering what support we need to put in place to help her through this operation.
She's very nervous, not got a support network in place of people who've been through the same, is wanting us to support her throughout the process but we don't know at this point what we can do to help her.
We're all working as we have mortgages to pay and so trying to understand what time off we need to to arrange work wise to support her. And obviously what physical, practical and emotional sides we need to help with to ensure she has a successful outcome.
Can I ask you guys to offer us advice based on your own experience?
What support would you say is what you needed at the time that wasn't covered by the standard training session of ""this is what will happen to you"". That standard seminar didn't seem to cover anything more than the immediate surgery and what to expect in hospital.
She's ground floor flat, which has pull cords to alert if needed in an emergency. But she's so independent, she doesn't think that level of help will be required.
She's confused about how she will wash etc. She has a shower, but it has steps up to get in it. But my understanding is that for the first 3 weeks, you aren't able to have a shower and must to a strip wash?
We've got a seat so she can sit at the sink and do a strip wash comfortably and we've tested it out with her.
She's worried about sleeping in her bed which is a single bed. She chose that deliberately so that she sleeps on her back - but struggles to remain on her back even with a pillow between her legs.
We are going to draw up a schedule to help her but we can't be there 24/7.
I've got her clothes that are easy to wear - jogging trousers, baggy tops. This is a woman who normally wears skirts and tights - but she says she's okay to wear such clothes ""in house"". We've done a test run so she knows what to expect.
Food etc we've sorted out with Wiltshire Farm Foods which she's been using for a few months now.
But it's hard if you don't really want to eat I'm guessing after a major op and perhaps we need to do a bit more?
Mum is saying that other people she knows go in to convalence homes after their hip ops because they don't have family to care for them and she wants to do that.
All of the care homes I've contacted have said they won't take Mum unless she's part of the social service assessment after her op. Is there anything we can do in advance?
Thank you so much for reading this and any answers you give.

"Yes me again ,
I know you are probably sick of my constant posts and complaints .
I have had a lot of hassle in my home town because I refused to let a Surgeon do my operation in Glasgow Royal Jubilee Hospital because and I quote him "" You will get Tramadol after your operation like it or not thats what we give you""
Now I have sleep apnea and did my research before going to see the consultant and after what he said I decided on the side of caution.
I have since seen a Consultant in Woodend Hospital Aberdeen who said NO WAY should I be given tramadol with sleep apnaea ( My choice not tho go to Glasgow was right PHEW)
Anyway found this post on opiates Tramadol , Morphine dihydrocodine ( I think are all in the same catagory)
Opiates are well known for depressing the respiratory system during sleep, when it relies on involuntary brain signaling to function. When the signals from the brain to the diaphragm are depressed by opioid medications, they lose strength, leading to reduced tone in the muscles that should be working together to support breathing.
Yes I may be a nuisance but maybe just maybe this will help or save someone out there

"I am truly angered by the number of hip replacements and told to get lifts. I have an inch off from one leg to the next. I suffer from back problems, walking problems, and all around comfort due to have my hip done. Not my choice... I had an left ankle replacement a year before that and lost a suit against the folks who put the water on the floor in which I slipped on .
How do we hold the manufacturer or the surgeon accountable? Pain is what we were looking to get rid of, only to find out there is more to come. I want to end this madness. I am too young to feel like I am 80 ( sorry 80 year olds), but I am a young soon to be 55 with a great life ahead of me and this is just annoying.

"Hi there. I had my left hip replaced 12 weeks ago. At six weeks despite lots of movement and exercise to become fit again i had a tennis ball lump sitting under my scar, which impeded certain movements and has made sitting so painful it made me feel sick. With physio and laser treatment this has reduced and dispersed, but it is now a huge swelling across my hip, buttock and thigh. I still cannot sit and lying is painful. I feel that my side is going to split it is so tight. It is not going down fast and my groin lymph nodes are swollen and aching trying to deal with it. I have deep achy pains inside and I get sudden sharp pains from the groin down my leg which stop me sleeping. I cannot take ibuprofen with other drugs i take and nothing I can take appears to reduce this. The orthopaedic surgeon and GP do not take any interest in this lympodema yet it is not going down my calf at all. Has anyone had a similar experience and if so how did you resolve it please?

Its been very disappointing as I thought by now I would be feeling much better, I eventually pushed my self to visit my daughter, although nervous about traveling on my own I got there. I requested assistance and traveled light. My daughter was at the station to meet me. We had a great week, I had the best nights sleep in ages! we went for walks and visited the gym, I didnt do anything extreme but did what i could, gentle walk on treadmill, used the bike etc and felt so much better! However since I have returned I have felt tired and seem to have the pain back three fold I cant think why? her bed is probably not nearly as firm as mine, cant think why???? I feel the way I do I struggle to keep my eyes open! I got home Wednesday and trying get back to the way I was when away but not doing very well, even my physio was a let down! going back for physio tomorrow, hoping to do better????

"I am truly angered by the number of hip replacements and told to get lifts. I have an inch off from one leg to the next. I suffer from back problems, walking problems, and all around comfort due to have my hip done. Not my choice... I had an left ankle replacement a year before that and lost a suit against the folks who put the water on the floor in which I slipped on .
How do we hold the manufacturer or the surgeon accountable? Pain is what we were looking to get rid of, only to find out there is more to come. I want to end this madness. I am too young to feel like I am 80 ( sorry 80 year olds), but I am a young soon to be 55 with a great life ahead of me and this is just annoying.
I went to therapy and they tell me they can get me straight. However, that is only for a couple of hours and then I shrink right back. I have tried everything from stretching, to turmeric, to glucosamine, and IBU.Nothing is working.
I am almost two years post op and would like to be whole again. Who is with me???

"Hi all,
I am about 10 months post op from LTHR. Like many of you, I have had bouts where I struggled through pain that did not seem totally normal. Everything from tendinitis, to bursitis, to failed osteointegration went through my mind (and my surgeons). While I steadily progresses, and pain got better over time, I continued to have flare ups of pain after overdoing it (which can be extremely easy to do if you suffered from limited RoM for many years prior to a THR (atrophy and tightness of muscles can lead to strains and tears). Anyway, what I found really odd was that my pain seemed go move all over the place, and was often felt in places far removed from my hip (knee, shin)... but also in the groin, the outside (lateral) of the thigh, and low back. I just couldn't figure it out. I eventually found a very experienced and highly respected sports physiotherapist. He spent time explaining the concept of referred pain and trigger points (I have known about trigger points and pain referral for a while, but did not realize just how far pain can refer).. He pressed hard on a number muscles, and I was shocked at how it triggered pain in other areas (for example, he pressed on my TFL, and it referred pain well below the knee). He recommended a massage ball, and it seemed to really help.
Recently I found a fantastic book on Amazon called ""The trigger point therapy workbook"". I was a little sceptical, but the reviews were very high. So I figured since it's only $25... so why not. Long story short, the book is awesome. It has a ton of information on trigger points and there pain referral pattern. Anyway, what I learned is that I have trigger points all over my left leg... in my glutes, in my quads, in my adductors and abductors. Basically every muscle around the hip. I do not know if they were cause by the trauma from the surgery, from over doing it during my recovery, or existed prior to the surgery from the limited RoM. But one thing that is for sure, once I started treating the trigger points (via IMS and self massage), my pain quickly started to abate.
I still have a long way to go in my recovery. At 10 months out there is still considerable weakness in muscles that were not used for over 4 years (primarily external rotators). And I still get pain flare ups when I over do it... though that happens much less as I gain strength, and I am able to treat the quickly. I have not yet returned to sports that require sprinting or jumping (baseball, volleyball, hockey, etc.), mostly because I will not be cleared by my surgeon until the 1 year mark... but also because I know I kneed to continue to strengthen the muscles around my hip. But discovering most of my pain is being caused by trigger points, and being able to treat that pain has really help my recovery and overall confidence in my new hip.
So, if you are several months post op and are still in a lot of pain, you might want to consider the possibility that some of your your pain is muscle pain from trigger points. You don't need to see a physiotherapist or buy a book (like I did) to learn about trigger points and how to treat them... there is lots of information on the good old interweb ;P ... though I will say I like having the information right at hand in the boom and not having to hunt for it.
Anyway, I just thought I would share my experience and some information I have learned. I hope some of you find it helpful in your recovery.
P.S. I am on the younger side (just past 40)... so, as my surgeon pointed out early on in my recovery, being younger does not mean recovering quicker. And it may mean that you will develop more trigger points due to increased muscle mass. Just something to consider if you are on the younger side and frustrated by your recovery not going faster.
Cheers!

"hello. i had a right THR 8 months ago. At first all was well, then around 10 weeks after surgery the pain kicked in. To cut a long story short, i have seen 7 DOCTORS, had 2 mri's, aCT SCAN, 2 electro nerve tests, xrays, blood tests , ultrasound and 10 physio sessions with needles and electro massage.
The pain is awful, my GP has now put me on FENTANYL patches!
the pain is around the new hip area ( not the incision site)... in the groin and across the thigh . I cannot raise my thigh. I Cant sleep on either side, and i can only walk very slowly with the aid of sticks or a walker. I am 61, and normally fit and healthy.
Doctors have tested for and ruled out.. infection, incorrect placement, loosening. psoas impingment, nerve damage, muscle damage, bone damage.
They dont know what to do or say now and are just passing me from dr to dr.
i truly cant take this pain much longer.
any ideas? any suggestions would be so appreciated.

"After several years of increasing stiffness in both hips and lots of groin pain, I decided in Summer of 2017 to have x-rays taken. These showed that there was severe cartilage loss at left hip and a lesser amount of loss on the right. Doctor diagnosis was 'wear and tear'. I wasn't quite sure what this meant. I thought it was just my doctor's way of telling me that I was getting on (I'm 61). He recommended physiotherapy exercises which really did seem to make a difference for a couple of months but by January/February 2019 I could hardly walk 15 minutes on some days and experienced extreme stiffness after sitting for even 10 minutes. I was also having difficulty bending down and doing simple things like putting on my socks. While living abroad, I visited an Orthopedic doctor who told me in no uncertain terms that I had severe Osteoarthritis and would need to have both hips replaced. I was shocked and felt that I needed to get another opinion. Same result! Right hip was operated on on 20th March 2019. All went well. Progress has been fine. My problem now is that my left hip gets very sore but not just that, my knees can hurt and feel loose and wobbly especially going down stairs. 10 weeks on, I feel that my new hip has maybe not had as much walking as it should have and I'm just hoping that this will remedy itself and I'll be able to 'catch up' after the other hip gets down at the end of September! Why the sore knees?

"Hi. I had a right hip replacement 9 days ago at the age of 52. After many years of thinking I had a problem with my back, I was finally diagnosed last year with mild DDH (Developmental Dysplaysia of the hip), a labrum tear and osteoarthritis. I had a hip arthroscopy just before christmas last year, but unfortunately it was unsuccessful and my osteoarthritis just got worse. it was finally decided that my only option was to have a full hip replacement.
As I am a little bit younger then the average age of people undergoing a hip replacement, I do feel a bit alone. It's been 9 days since my operation and I think I'm doing okay. . Spent 3 nights in hospital. Managing to walk with crutches (sometimes just one) and still taking painkillers on a regular basis. I'm hoping to get off painkillers as soon as I feel able to. The surgical socks are driving me mad and I wonder if I can stop using them now (?).

"Hello
Just wanting to thank and update this patient community that I found prior to my total right hip replacement. I was incredibly anxious leading up to the operation and lost a lot of blood on the operating table requiring blood transfusions. At times I felt that my recovery was slow. The emotional and mental impact of recovery and the operation was a surprise for me, there were times I was tearful and wondered if I had made the right decision.
Now 6 months post op, I can say I did make the right decision! Life is good, I experience NO pain and I am having no issues at all! I put this down in part to probably taking my recovery slowly.
I am walking further than I have in years! (I am 45). I am pulling boxes of my old high heels out of my wardrobe and am wearing them again! Nobody would have a clue I have had a THR. The transformation is like night and day. My family are delighted for me. For Mothers Day I decided we would go for a bush walk....I couldnt and wouldnt have done that in 7 years. Anyway I just wanted to post on here, its always good to hear some good news.

"In early 2000 at age 40 I had a labral tear in my right hip. Terrible groin pain and weakness. Never did the surgery until 2013 Wound up not working and in 2015 had a THR in Vegas. Immediately after the surgery was having psoas issues getting numerous cortisone and botox injections that eventually stopped working. March 2018 had a Psoas release in Boca Raton,Fl which provided some relief but my hip was still never right. Could not walk long distances extreme difficulty up and down stairs and getting in and out of car. Saw hip surgeon and and had CT scan and MRI and he he noticed several things wrong with implant misalignment of head and wrong size cup. He felt the implant was not not secure thus causing all this difficulty. 10 days ago I get revision done via Anterior approach and now I have Femoral Nerve Palsy! Leg is pretty much numb and I get horrific shocks -stinging when I attempt to lift leg up. Surgeon said he sees this once a year and of course I am the .3%!
I do not know how much more of this I can take as right now I am pretty more chair and bed ridden. Surgeon claims it can r=take 2 weeks to 3 weeks to resolve itself. I research further and that does not seem to be the case, taking a year or more and maybe never resolved!
Need advice as I can't continue like this!

"Hello Hippie Friends, I went for my first post op check after 12 days of surgery, I had my second hip replacement 18th APRIL, I have been struggling as I have a dropped foot on same side as my surgery, and also suffering with sciatica due to epidural and having to lay in same position. I honestly didnt think I was doing very well but told I was and they took off my dressing, which means I can go into the shower, I can also lay on my right side if i put a pillow between my legs. So at least I can now change positions providing my right hip will allow it as its still not properly healed up. I expected to be given some physiotherapy but i am told its too early! to just walk as much as possible. Although I am keen to get back to normal I will take my time rather than risk dislocating, its such a relief to get the dressing off and now on my last lap to getting back to normality. Taking one day at a time hopefully i will be ok by summer

"Hi, Can anyone explain what the procedue is after a hip operation when the muscle does not repair itself? Does anyone know of an expert in this field? I limp to one side badly and this is causing pain in the hip area and lower back.
I do a lot of physio anyway, such as exercises, aqua fit, rehab swimming, I assume this all helps or is it a waste of time?

"hi i had my left THR over 2 years ago at age 49
everyday is not perfect but no severe pain as before the surgery
now over 2 years later i do feel great health wise and walk everyday
walking has done wonders for my hip
i was always athletic and fit - i gained weight when i went through pain before surgery and after
so anyone who feels slugish or stiff
get up and walk
get a fitness tracker too - its a great motivator
ok this is my 2 cents worth

"So what a journey and a fantastic one to being pain free. From pre op weeks/months/years of pain to post op!!
My muscle is still on the tight side, but its getting better each day. And so is the limp.
I have stretches now from physio, I have gone back to osteopath and thats helping with the muscle, only seeing him once a month though. And still icing it. I can walk up to two miles without sticks but have brought a fold up one so it can go in a packback. I will only use it if I need to.
I have my phase return for mornings only and am now actually looking forward to getting back there.
And thank you to all you lovely people, with all your help and advice and the friendships made.

"i致e already had a half hip replacement after breaking my hip a couple of years ago. I致e had a lot of problems, but the groin pain in that hip seems to be better now. I cannot believe that I am now suffering groin pain in my other hip! . I know groin pain can be a sign of osteoarthritis, and a surgeon told me i had very early signs of OA but I have complete pain-free range of movement as when I am lying down I can circle my hip in the air which doesn稚 hurt at all. I can put all my weight on that leg, I can even stamp on it and it doesn稚 hurt but it does hurt if I stretch the leg out behind me, or lift my knee up to my chest and the groin throbs when I'm sitting. I mentioned it to my doctor. She examined me and said she thought it was soft tissue problem and gave me strong anti inflamatories. I've been on them for two weeks but they've done nothing. I've have never had osteo arthritis and I want to ask for some advice from people who have had it. What are the first signs? Do you get the groin pain before any other pain in the hip starts or is it possible that it's just my tendon playing up? is there any way of determining what the problem is? I have Multiple Sclerosis and I know they won稚 give me a hip replacement in my other hip so I知 obviously hopeful that there are other reasons for the groin discomfort. don稚 want to google too much as I値l scare myself half to death! Any reassurance welcome!

Yes I am still here I am afraid,
I called the hospital where i was first referred too and was told I still have at least 24 weeks to wait for a consultation appointment
So I have taken things to the next level and contacted a couple of MSP,s and Jeane Freeman the secretary of health for Scotland as well as a couple of others.
I just think its time we stood up for ourselves (No pun intended)
My walking is deteriorating pretty fast now , Dihydrocodine is losing effect so dont know what to do about that
but I am keeping the fight going , I dont see why we have to put up with being treated second best

"Hi ,
yes still waiting to see a consultant about a bi lateral hip replacement. There has been a development with my right knee .My problem has always been my right hip and lately I have started getting bad pain in my right knee which is very similar to my hip. I have never had trouble with my knees .
I also feel my left hip starting to give me a nagging pain and discomfort.
My question is will my knee pain clear up after they eventually fix my hip or has the delay in fixing my hip also caused my right knee to require treatment due to the delay . what should i do ?
thanks for any advice

Right now it hurts to take a step ....still cant lift the leg....still go up the stairs one at a time....still feel especially around the knee numbness and do not function like a normal  human being! The only thing I got from the surgeon was a handicape sticker!  Needless to say I am soooooo angry that this happened when many say it should not have as the surgeon knows where the femoral nerve is!!!! Oh and my leg is harder and bigger then the other one!

"At age 91, it seemed I'd outlived the partial hip replacement I underwent 20 years ago. I was in constant but bearable pain until 2-3 months ago when I began to experience excruciating pain upon intermittent, debilitating hip locking! Diagnosis suggested the metal head of the Thompson's prosthesis was eroding the bone in my pelvic socket. This led to my having to make a frightening decision as to whether to undergo total hip revision surgery; major surgery accompanied by huge risks and possible complications given my 91 years of age. Of most concern was the risk of femur bone fracture upon removal of the well cemented old prosthesis and complications of major, 3 hour surgery such as haemorrhage, kidney failure, heart failure, pneumonia.
After reviewing comments and experiences from this group, reviewing recent publications of anthroplasty statistics & outcomes, and researching the qualifications and experience of hip revision surgeons, I decided to take the plunge and book-in to undergo total hip revision surgery last week.
I am very happy and extremely relieved to report that the 3 hour surgery went smoothly and none of the possible complications eventuated. The surgery was performed under spinal block epidural and light sedation. I came out of anaesthesia well and spent and expected 3 days in ICU to stabilise blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels and kidney function before being transferred to a standard orthopaedic ward where I currently remain.
It has been 6 days since surgery. I am on panadol osteo and daily oxycodene , have no pain when resting and no longer experience hip-locking. I am walking very short distances now with a support frame - this is painful and difficult but of course will improve over time, (hopefully). In two or so days time, I will be transferred to the rehabilitation arm of the hospital. This is where the ""fun"" will truly begin! Let's hope it will not be too painful!
Overall a very successful ""Step 1"". Now onto rehabilitation and full recovery! I know it's an individual thing but, does anyone have any insight as to how long re-hab may take, or how long for pain to subside after total hip revision surgery?
Thank you for your comments on this site and all the best Easter wishes to you all!

"Hi. I had a fall seven weeks ago and broke my femur. I was lucky it was not my hip,at the time I was using a crutch as I was already post 3 mths after ankle tendon surgery and I was going so well until I over balanced and fell backwards onto the kitchen floor.Ouch!!!!! I thought I had only discolated my thigh bone. Anyway, Im now seven weeks post surgery.no pain just a little discomfort now and again. Not using ANY crutches,just a walking frame. I can stand for a few minutes but very hesitant to try walking without any support. I am seeing my specialist this wednesday as well as having an xray to see how Ive healed. Been reading stories on this page and yes I have to agree, we are all in a hurry to get mobile again but after my fall I am prepared to take it a bit slower if I have too.

I can hardly walk with the pain and don't know if it is a hip flare up or the injection. It just seems funny that all this bad pain started after the injection.

"I had bilateral hip resurfacing 11yrs ago. I was 45 , single mum with 2 young kids. Op and recovery went well. My surgeon moved to a different hospital in the North of England. I was never called in for a check and didn't think to ask for one - I was enjoying a new lease of life. Just over 1 yr ago I got a letter from the NHS to go for a check up. I had an xray and blood test and was told I'd be called in the following yr for another check.
2 weeks ago, I attended my checkup appointment. The xray showed something and I was booked in for an MRI and CT scan which showed severe bone loss around both implants. I have to have 2 full hip replacements asap, 1 at a time though as I need bone grafts on both
Having done a bit of research it seems that back in 2012 the MHRA (regulatory agency) recommended annual checks for the life of the implant. I'm feeling that there's a case of negligence here? - looking at my MRI pictures I'm surprised my pelvis hasn't collapsed - such severe bone loss.
Any comments or similar experiences greatly appreciated.

"Hi Folks - I had TRHP on 12/26/18 and doing real well. MY surgeon gave me full clearance about 2 weeks ago.
Prior to surgery, I had 4 spinal blocks in my back - none worked - and cortisone shots. 1st 2 cortisone shots didn't work, 3rd one did and it gave me a month pain free. Saw 3 surgeons - one said ""you're hip isn't the problem, it's your spine. The other said ""it's your hip and spine,"" pain doctor said ""it's your sacroiliac joint - I had considered stem cell treatment with him."" Within the year I developed AVN and as I said above, on 12/26/18 I had TRHP.
Before surgery I had been going to yoga daily and it helped my back and I used props for my hip. I'm back at yoga, stretching and walking miles again. Right hip feels great. About a week ago, my left groin started aching, like a tight band was wrapped around it, pain went down the back of my left leg, and my left butt began to hurt. Advil did not help and I saw an ortho right across the street. He put me on the medrol pack but my knee still hurts. I have an appt with a spine doctor this week. I contacted my surgeon and will get an MRI of my left hip in May. He noted that in November 2018 my left hip looked fine, but as I know, things can change rapidly ie, the AVN. He also noted 25% of patients need the other hip done.
Have any experienced this, as to me, seems rapid. Or it could be my back but resembles hip.
Thanks in advance,

I only feel pain doing one simple exercise. You stand and lift the bad leg up towards the ceiling (foot stays down, just raise the knee upwards while standing) to strengthen it. I was doing it fine before but now it hurts. I get sharp pains around the knee and the hip joint area.
I didn't have this a week ago. Maybe it's just overworked muscles.

"Hi! I just got my first job in years and I am barely through the second week. The pain is so bad! Even worst than my first few days which I expected to be painful. Now whenever I walk or even just shift to get comfortable in bed, I get sharp stabbing pains right under my buttock/groin area. I have had similar pains in the past but not quite in this area and not as so much. It is getting to the point that I can not sleep and I barely eat due too so much pain I get dizzy and or sick to my stomach.
I have had this hip replacement for almost 12 years and my real hip my right one does have arthiris and currently feels like someone kicked it all the dang time. I need this job at McDonalds just to pay bills. I was hoping to last just three months to get caught up in some bills and get some medical equipment since I am on disability but they keep making cut backs on it. I am trying to last even to the end of the month now so hopefully my mom can have a job by than but it is getting so hard. I am at my wits end and do not now what to do. I am the only one who currently has any money coming in and every single penny is going to rent and stuff. I have not even gotten a hair cut in 3 years because money is so tight. And now this stupid pain just will not go away instead of getting better it gets worst.
I am so scared I am at the point that I take almost five minutes to get up to go pee (my bedroom is right beside the bathroom). I pray just to get through the night at work and not collapse, there have been a few close calls just last night alone. And I do not dare say anything to mom due to the fact that she is already freaking out that she still hasn't found a job. If it didn't hurt so much to cry I would be.
So does anyone have any tricks to help me make it through the night? I really just need a few more weeks or month. Any ideas will be great. Thanks.

"So, I have been having some hip pain for the last couple of months. Just the other day, I was trying to exit the car and almost collapsed from the pain I experienced. Just received the results of the MRI and wanted to see what I am dealing with. Thank you. Yes, I have a follow up appt. with my ortho. RESULTS: Mild hip joint degenerative disease with diminished articular cartilage and labral tear/degeneration anterosuperiorly associated with cam femoral acetabular impingement. Mild gluteal insertional tendinosis and trochanteric bursitis. SO, based on the appt. yesterday and my previous it looks like I will be having surgery. I saw an orthopedic hip specialist and based on the MRI/XRAYS, this is my only option. He indicated that the ball on my femur has an extra bone this making the ball uneven. He said this occurred during my adolescent years and it happened at my growth plate. He will need to shave the bone down, re attach the labrum with anchors. He said he does close to 500 of the procedures a year and it very common. The doctor is affiliated with HSS(Hospital for Special Surgery). I won't mention names as I don't know if that's allowed. Just curious if anyone else has had this and how they fared. Thank you.

"I wrote this group over a year ago - when I had to decide to move first (doctor strongly recommended) or have operation first. Well, the consensus here was also to move first - so that is what I did. I am now in my new home - it turned out to be a much longer process due to the fact that my home did not sell right away. Also, was very hard with my hip condition - but I got through it! Now that my operation is only 3 day away - I am so nervous, scared, etc. etc. I guess I am looking up everything on the internet and seeing what can ""go wrong"" - so I probably should have a positive outlook and faith in my doctor. Is each person different - are restrictions lifted on some people earlier than others? Can you sleep on your side? I have been using a cane/walker and cannot walk on my own right now - so I know my balance is going to be off - how do you get that back? What are the best exercises everyone found to be most helpful? Is walking outside a good exercise? I know I have so many questions, but honestly the only people who can really answer are the people who have gone through this. I feel very handicapped and just want to be able to walk again and enjoy life - bad depression right now. Good luck and God Bless each and everyone of you going through this - I am sure it is not easy but as long as there is a light at the end of the tunnel - I can do it!!!

"Hello!
I wanted to make a post about my experience. My hip joint was destroyed, full of spurs and down to the bone. I was stuck with using a cane, a huge limp and a 3 inch short leg. I could not do much at this point. I was unable to exercise to strengthen before surgery because my movement was limited and caused a lot of pain and made it hard for me to walk afterwards. Became very sad about everything.
Now 4 weeks after surgery, I am excited about life again. My sadness is gone, pain gone, short leg gone and now at perfect length! I move without pain from my hip problems or the surgery, I can do the exercises now and actually feel the muscles working. I haven't felt that in so long, it's exciting. And I am very happy! I changed so quickly from sad to happy, it's such a weird feeling to have.
1st week from surgery, I felt tight and slow moving. My hips were stuck in anterior tilt. The pain seemed fine on the tiny amount of meds I took. Sleeping was very uncomfortable. I took lots of naps.
2nd week, sleeping still annoying. Starting to move a bit more. End of week 2 I stopped using a walker and started with crutches. Muscles are starting to loosen up.
3rd week, out and about walking with crutches. I put a lot of weight on them and got sore hands but it was worth it! Once I was back inside I was very tired and had naps. I also stopped taking pain meds around here. Also quit taking the blood thinners because they were making me very itchy all over my body and dry. Anterior tilt starting to go away.
4th week, doing great. I can walk pretty fast with my crutches. I tried to walk without them but my leg is not strong yet and I limp to the side. I am also not allowed to walk freely (Dr's orders) but I wanted to test it out anyway. Anterior tilt gone. Muscles are no longer tight. I still can't move my leg freely, need longer to heal first. I am not allowed to do harder exercises, tilt or bend etc for a while.. I also lost all of my glutes, hamstrings on the bad side and you can see atrophy with my quads. So it will take a while to get back to normal but I'm still feeling great and can't wait for summer to have fun!

"it has been 8 months since i had my hip replacement and returned to work Jan 16. there is not a day that goes by that i am not in pain. just going for a walk i pay for it,and it isn't even the side i had the surgery on . i thought it was because of the way i was walking with a limp. SO went to a specialist in Pedorthics spent 800 all together on a pair of shoes with a lift built in and cant even wear them . Have a appointment on Friday with a chiropractor hoping that might help. Is there anybody else who has been going through the same thing and if so any Advice would be appreciated

"Had first hip surgery 9/2017, after numerous problems with the device had to have it removed and a cement spacer placed in for temp two stage replacement. I developed cancer in the lymph node; after 3 rounds of chemo i would be able to finish the replacement of the hip. Now i have seen the surgeon and she said I can opt to keep the spacer a d take PT to learn how to walk with it .. keeping in mind now leg is at least 2-3 inches shorter. Has anyone else had this process done? How are you walking? Currently I am not weight bearing and use a walker and wheelchair.

"Hi all. New to this forum y hubby is due e to have 2 stage hip revision surgery part one on Tuesday. He has severe rheumatoid arthritis and has been off his biolog meds for nearly 19 months because of the hip. Been waiting ages for ""urgent"" surgery as he's has listeria in his hip. Been leaking for 10 months
Luckily my practice nurse came up with the plan to put a urology bag over the wound and the fluid just leaks into there so we don't have dressings to change 3 times a day. He's dreading the surgery as we live in York and it's being done in the Sheffield specialised centre. Any advice at all??
His mobility is generally rubbish with the rheumatoid but otherwise he's healthy
Thanks in advance

"Hi can anyone suggest a comfortable way of sleeping on back? I am going to have my second hip replacement and absolutely dread it! Having to sleep on my back for next few weeks is daunting! I have a back problem and found it very difficult when I got my right hip done in December it was very painful and even my heels hurt! needless to say I was unable to sleep and felt exhausted all the time! I still dont sleep very well but at least I can sleep on operated side now, as well as my un-operated side which is only for a short time because of the discomfort, hopefully that will be solved after my surgery. Will it be better to sit up on a high pillow or is it better to lie flat, I cant seem to find any back supports suitable, I would appreciate some suggestions if anyone out there has had similar problems, I also get pain in my buttocks when staying in the same position thank you in advance Cyndey

"Hey folks, One year out from posterior hip replacement. Lot s of ""Challenges"" still unable to do stairs and recently the outer thigh in the operated side has developed a thickening of the skin almost a bump. I can barely walk any distance at all and rely on pain medications like advil or tylenol which really are not helping much. I see the surgeon for my one year post op next week but my other visits have not been helpful either in treatment or information. Any suggestions how to resolve this? I am not looking to be an athlete or runner. I was just want to be able to do some walking without pain. My expectations for help or resolution from the orthopedist are now low so I know I am going to have to find my own solution as they just keep saying it takes time. Have done plenty of PT, chiropractic and massage. I have also developed burning red feet after the surgery which combined with hip pain is making me less optimistic about the future on my feet.I keep reading about the femoral stem and distribution of the stress points on the thigh. Can anyone enlighten me?

"Thought it might be helpful for those considering THR to share my timeline. I am a fit 63 year old, this is my 2nd THR. My hip was replaced with a small stem modular titanium & porcelain prosthesis
Day -1 Having misgivings about having it done. Is the pain really bad enough?
Day 1 Feeling of euphoria at having it done
Days 2-4 traumatic, mainly due to sleep disruption caused by anaesthetic still in system messing with head. Walking with crutch. Daily hydrotherapy which is very pleasant and feels beneficial. Slightly nauseous, difficulty enjoying food
Day 6 Back home. Definite feelgood factor sleeping in own bed. Have to sleep on back for at least 14 days
Day 7 Walking without stick. Very little pain, just taking paracetamol at night. Sleep almost normal now
Day 8 Started taking short walks outside. Feel vulnerable
Day 11 Stick discarded for stair climbing
Day 9-14 Walking around 1km a day. Bit of a plateau at this point. The improvement is there each day but quite gradual
Day 14 No painkillers now. Can do proper climbing up and down stairs, i.e. one foot in front of other
Day 18 walked 2.5 km
Day 20 still sleeping on back and now on operated side for short periods (pillow between legs) although a bit uncomfortable on the wound. Thinking about frontal position
Day 21 up to 4.4km walking. Changed dressing again as it was letting in water. Cleaned dry blood from scar, which looks ok
Day 23 Walked 5km. Knackered. Surgical stockings discarded
Day 24 Turned over onto favoured frontal position to sleep
Day 26 Follow-up visit to Surgeon, by train/tube . All good. Advised me against sleeping on front as there is a risk in turning over. Walked 6.7km today in total. Advised me to not drive until 6 weeks. No sport for 3 months as bone won稚 have grown into the titanium until then so falls are more risky. Dressing removed.
Day 28 Went to watch football at Wembley all ok
Day 29 Went swimming for the first time. Swam front crawl and a bit of breaststroke. Really tired afterwards. Getting sock over foot on operated leg is really tough. Takes a while. Surgeon suggested exercise with legs apart toes pointing outwards, stretch downward
Day 30 Leg is stiff for first few paces but then walking is normal. Elevated chairs now discarded, able to sit on normal chair to eat. Elevated toilet seat discarded
Day 31 After trying for several minutes managed to hook sock onto the end of the foot of operated leg. Can then gradually pull it on all the way up. Significant in that can now be totally self sufficient in getting ready in the morning
Day 35 Swimming again. Breaststroke with no soreness
Day 37 Able to sleep in any position now
Two months on now and feel pretty much normal. Plan on resuming tennis and walking football after three months

"Saw my surgeon today for my second post-op and got fantastic news - all restrictions are off! It痴 not even three months since TRHP. March 26 would be a full 3 months. I no longer have to follow the 90 degree angle rule, I can cross my right leg, I can touch my toes, I can go back to yoga - 電ownward facing dog, child pose, chair pose, cat pose and so on. I had been going to yoga at least 5 times a week and not being able to do yoga left a void that I continually reminded myself was temporary. I can now take my dogs hiking and I can ride my bike!
I never expected the surgery to be such a roller coaster, physically and emotionally. I have since discovered, especially from this group, that it is not unusual. I had a very different experience when having both knees replaced. I recall just trying to weight bear after this recent surgery, would bring tears to my eyes and the other day, through various walks, I managed 4-1/2 miles.
摘ach of us has a 都oft spot: the place in our experience where we feel vulnerable and tender. This soft spot is inherent in appreciation and love, and it is equally inherent in pain.

"Hi, I had a thp 5 weeks ago. Immediately as I was recovering from after surgery I noticed numbness and a pins and needles feeling in my foot. It has not gone away abd I mentioned it agsin to my surgeon during a follow-up yesterday. I called him a few days after the surgery as well, at which time he said it was ""not normal"" he also told me there was no nerve damage during surgery (he brought that up). Yesterday, he immediately said it has nothing to do with the surgery and it must be a ""pinched nerve in your back or something"". That was the end of that discussion. Well, I was not born yesterday, abd his not even considering that it may be nerve damage from surgery was a bit unnerving to me. I do not have foot drop, as I can bear weight and am only tingly and numb at ball of foot and toes. I can feel things, and also pressure, and temperature. But it doesn't seem fully, and there is always tingling along with a heaviness. Sometimes, tinges of oain on foot and ankle.. Has anyone experienced this? Thank you in advance for any input!

And I know it relatively early days still, but I am still limping unaided. I also struggle to stand on operated without holding on.
However, when using two sticks walking is a pleasure and I can now walk well.
All I want to do as well is stand in the shower but being a shortie, I will not be able to clear the bath as I get in to it.

he said to continue to think before acting but that the chance of dislocation was very very minimal.

I'm 55, play sport pros, have bad angles on my hip joints, but not really have any pain, as I'm very conservative in activity, now doing only swim, yoga, stretch. Normally don't take any pills, sleep OK without pain on good mattress, just sometime take motrin after some household work. People see that I little limping, on stairs do one step for 2 legs.
Just thinking should I wait till 60+ something, all video show evaluation for elderly guys, so I'm thinking maybe I can wait.
I live in CA, USA.
Appreciate you real life feedback, doc said =Sure we can do this=.
Tx much

"Hi
I had a successful hip replaced in Nov (left hip) and all was going well, back to work. feeling like it my own hip. So I decided to increase my excercise and got advice from a Personal Trainer at the gym. Did lots of leg/glute excercises and now my right hip is in agony. Pain is the same as before the op on the left (Buttock, groin and unable to walk well)
On the xray my right hip looked ok (slight erosion only) have i just pulled something or is it the right one crumbling now!
Just when i was thinking i could get back to normal and increase my excercise regimes beyond the physio and walking. I cant bear to go through all that pain again........

"When I was told by my GP that the waiting list for a THR was probably twelve months or more I started looking to have the operation elsewhere in Europe where it seemed waiting time and cost were much less. There were so many adverts from Latvia, Lithuania, France and even Thailand complete with glowing testimonials from previous patients, but I've not read of anybody on this site who had the operation other than in their own country. The thought of a train journey or flight only a week after the THR, and the problem of after care, rather put me off. Luckily I managed to get an operation under the NHS just four months after my visit to my GP.
Has anybody ventured to have a THR in other than their own country ???

"I had my second hip replacement three weeks ago, I was doing really well and the operation was fine.
my husband went back to work and my problems seem to have started.
This week it has become much more difficult and I would like to know if this is normal?
I am taking paracetamol three times a day (not at night) but my hip and thigh still really hurt when I walk. I am walking with one crutch for the last week, but it is sore. Is that normal at this stage? It doesn't hurt when it is raised and rested, but I can't rest as I have two children to look after.
I am regularly feeling dizzy and so exhausted, I feel sick, I can't keep my eyes open for some parts of the day. I can do one or two activities with the children, a bit of housework and I am totally finished.
I don't know what to do, I am too tired to think straight. Please reassure me if you can, that this is to be expected or if I should call dr.

"HI, I had an Anterior total right hip replacement 15 weeks ago and Im 47 years old. I did not have to use crutches or a walker and i did 6 weeks of physical therapy two times a week.
I am having problems getting back to my normal walking routine which is walking 3-4 miles three to four times a week. I Cant go over 1 mile and its taking a few minutes longer to walk that mile. I understand the longer time but I dont understand why i cant walk at least 2 miles. I have no endurance it seems like. I am able to walk and do the things i need to do at home with no problems so it makes me feel like i should be able to do more. I have read on different message boards about people older than me and are already back to walking 5-6 miles per day so its very discouraging.
I went to the zoo yesterday with my grandchildren not even thinking about the walking that I would have to do and i was okay about 3/4 of the 3 hours we were there. During the last 30-40 minutes we were there my hip started hurting and never let up, I had no choice but to keep walking and I hurt the rest of the day and night.
Does anyone have any advice that may help me?

"This must be one of the most annoying situations I have been in
I had my x ray on my hips done on 27/11/2018 then was asked to attend the doctor to discuss the results.
The Radiologist had written that there was no hip joint left and basically it is bone on bone, The doctor kept telling me how bad it was and made an urgent referral, I phoned the hospital to chase things along but was told as mentioned in a previous post that it was not urgent and the wait would be 26 to 30 weeks.
I then had to go back to my surgery to give a routine blood test where the nurse questioned me about my hip and recommended i see a doctor.
I say the head of the practice who was shocked when he read the radiologist's report and his words were ""You have no hip joint left"" read the report out to me and said "" You need a hip replacement""
Later I phoned the hospital again and asked for an update, where the secretary told me the surgeon had seen the x ray and would see me in 30 weeks.
Can 2 doctors and a radiologist all be wrong ? I wonder if the surgeon has even seen the x ray and perhaps it was a registrar
I am now refusing to go to that hospital for treatment because if they cant see how bad my hip is there is no way they are going to operate on me.
I have written and asked for my x ray and radiologist's report .
Any advice on what I should do now as things are not getting any easier as you know it just gets worse every day
Thanks in advance

I feel my life is on hold as i cant arrange holidays ect. This will mean another pre op. It makes you wonder why the nhs is short of money having to do the tests again and leaving all the equipment doing nothing.

"Has anyone had their THR surgery cancelled at the last minute? This happened to me yesterday, after waiting 7 months for an operation date, rearranging work meetings, my daughter and partner sorting out time off work, doing all the pre-surgery requirements and even getting as far as being booked in at the hospital at 7.15am, having all my checks done and being told I was second on the list. The staff then were told the surgeon would not be in as his wife had gone into labour. Of course I completely understand and accept this is a very good reason to cancel, but my whole emotional and mental attitude to the op has now changed, at the moment I just dont want to know, I feel flat and very scared of going through the whole build up again, if anyone else has been through this I would be extremely grateful to hear how you coped.

Otherwise, I am doing great. I am 19 days post-op, still on Coumadin to prevent blood clots and for the most part, sleeping well because I am a back and side sleeper. The week in rehab was a huge help and my son took both dogs and is watching them. He brought home Randall, my 11 month old dog, and Randall was the best medicine for me. Today I walked a mile and yesterday I walked a little under a mile. Stairs are not a problem and I keep reminding myself . . . moderation. I even drove my car twice today. Short distance, but it felt great! My PT comes to my home and next week she is going to refer me to out-patient PT.

I'll let my pt know about the pain. When I had both knees replaced, I was directed to take pain meds before pt. The surgeon that I now have is incredibly reluctant to provide pain med. I have no more and am in pain. I just pt a call into whomever is covering for him and waiting for a call back. But, I'm at my wits end.

"Just to give an update to back pain question i asked the other day- In contact with physio and she has recommended that i go back on 2 crutches until my 6 week check up. She said it was far to early to be on 1 crutch and this was more than like putting strain on my back
She also recommended sleeping with pillow under my back for support at night as sleeping on my back could contribute to the pain as well.
So hopefully this helps and i can cut out the pain meds.

Can anyone help me with this. I am just 4 weeks after THR on right hit. About 2 weeks ago all pain meds that was prescribed finished and as i was in great form did not feel like i needed any more.
Woke up next morning with back pain. It was enough to need pain killers but thought nothing of it. But its still here. I did check with doc who thought i might have a UTI and put me on antiboctics and strong painkillers for 5 days which i finished yesterday but the pain is back this morning and its horrible.
Now the doc did say the hip replacement could have changed my gait or the way i walk and this could be affecting my back.
I do walk with my foot turned out as even with the swelling going down i cannot get my foot to turn in. And i don't see my consultant for another 3 weeks.

I have been given pain pills nothing seems to work I went for physical therapy they said I could massage the muscle that was about it.One doctor did want to re-open the hip area to see what was going on. NO ONE seems to have an answer for me except ""you will have to live with it."" My current medications include 2 ALEVE and 2 Extra strengh Arthritis tylenol 3x a day along with OXY and PERCOCET as needed. . I have had MRI, bone scans, CT and exrays. I have read about ILLIOPSIS muscle or tendon issues, could this be it? No DR has addressed this possibility. THANK YOU! I appreciate any help you can give. I live in Western Massachusetts

"Hello all,
I have been sitting on the sidelines reading all of your tales and issues as you deal with your 1st or 2nd, even sometimes 3rd total hip replacement. I am going in for my 2nd hip replacement Thursday morning - 2 years to the day after my 1st. This time it is my right hip.
I can tell you that I'd most definitely waited too long for this surgery. I have only been able to walk with a cane for the last month and my gate is horrible.
I've spent the last 2 days cleaning and preparing my home for post surgery. I have my basket ready with snacks, water, note cards & postage, a few books, and my meds! Comfy & convenient clothes are hanging nearby for quick access. New jammies, slippers, and robe await me.
I am ready for a new hip, and ready to turn 60 the following day! My sixties have to be better than my fifties! Best of luck to you all.

"I had a fall and broke my femur and hip. The first op, to insert a nail down femur and screws to hip, completely dislocated and the screw in my hip penetrated my hip socket.
I am now 8 weeks post complete hip replacement and extra metalwork in my femur.
Recovery is going well, but I still dread the uncomfortable nights.
I have been told I can sleep on my side, but when I do, with my good leg underneath, the top of my leg feels very bruised and achy.
I sleep with a pillow between my knees and I have to give up and sleep sitting up, which gives me backache and sore heels.
Any tips?

"Hi guys I was wondering if anyone has tried the circulation booster called Revitive, I have very poor circulation and tempted to buy one of these. They are meant to be good for arthritis and also good with the recovery of hip replacement and knee replacement, my legs still swell and its almost 9 weeks since I had my surgery, its also supposed to be good for swollen legs or feet. They are not cheap depending on what type or where you buy, so thought I would see if anyone else has tried this. The write up on these machines are very good but it would be interesting to find out if anyone else has used one thank you in advance Cyndey

"Hi all,
I am in the United States and the polar vortex is delivering a very intense cold snap! The temperatures just fell from 28 degrees Fahrenheit down to 20 degrees (-7 Celsius I think) in the last three hours alone. We are supposed to be experiencing wind chills in the negatives later on this evening and when I leave work to go home it will be another 5 degrees colder. I had an experience in December, two months post-op, where my friends and I were eating dinner in a nice, warm, cozy restaurant for a few hours. When we walked out it was bitterly cold and it hit me like a ton of bricks, going from the warm restaurant out into the bitter cold. My newly replaced hip joint literally just locked up! It's like not being able to swing your leg forward to walk. It was so scary my husband went and got the car from the parking garage because I didn't think I could make it that far. It's hard to describe, but does any one else have sensitivity to the cold temps shortly after their hip replacement? I am dreading leaving my office building later to get into my car. I'm afraid my hip joint will go into shock again like this experience I am describing.

Now getting sharp pain in groin area on right side, worse when standing up after sitting for a time and when coming downstairs. I'm basically a very sedentary person and am wondering if the muscles are tightening through lack of use or if I have managed to strain something though goodness knows how!

Should I simply get more active and start some gentle exercise. My GP is a believer in use it or lose it so I suspect I know what he would say.

"Arthritis was diagnosed in my left leg when I was about 54. It started when I felt a sharp pain in the groin after sprinting toward the net playing tennis. Thought it was a groin strain but the physio was sure it was hip arthritis. Eventually saw a consultant. Didn稚 feel very confident in the first guy so decided to use the consultant who had operated on my shoulder a few years before.
My understanding of the normal THR method is that when it wears out or fails the whole prosthesis has to be removed from the femur and replaced with a new one. This is clearly quite a big job. The surgeon who operated on both my hips is Ian Bacarese-Hamilton. He works from the Princess Grace Hospital in London and does NHS work at the Whittington Hospital. His method seems to vary slightly from mainstream thinking. He uses a shorter but fatter implant into the femur. The prosthesis also features a module which can be changed when it wears out. This means that the stem of the prosthesis does not need to be removed from the femur.
Had my left hip done 3 years ago at 59 years, the second one 14 days ago at 62. Operation carried out privately at King Edward 7th Hospital in Marylebone. Excellent facilities, staff and care. They also have a hydrotherapy pool which is great for post-op exercise.
Seems a bit easier this time round. Was playing tennis after 3 months last time and think it could be sooner with this one. Would recommend the op and my surgeon to anyone. Any specific questions please ask.

"Hi fello hippies!
I'm doing really great now it's starting to feel like a new hip at last. I can even put my own socks and lace-up shoes on again. Just one question: I work at a computer and I'm getting moderate pain at the bottom of my spine when sitting for any length of time (I get up and walk about every hour or so). It doesn't hurt so much while I'm sitting, but boy when I stand up it's like someone is stabbing me!
Anyone else had this? NB it only seems to happen when sat in an office chair or upright chair, lounging on the sofa is no problem...

I am getting used to the numbness during the day but at night it often wakes me feeling like my leg is on fire. Moving the skin by rubbing it makes the pain (and it is pain) worse.
I have not seen anyone else mention anything like this on the non op leg.

"hi everyone.
I was due to see my consultant today for 7 week checkup, but the hospital phoned to cancel due to illness and the earliest appointment they could offer is in another 4 weeks. They weren't helpful at all when I asked if I could speak to someone to answer some queries I had, but just told me to read the literature, so, I'm hoping to get some help from the forum. I'm pleased with my recovery, have been off painkillers for several weeks now, can walk easily without support and drove for the first time today. What I really want to do is get back to normality as soon as possible even if it means fighting through the exhaustion which seems to be fairly common among recovering patients. I'm pretty sure it's okay to go swimming, but any suggestions on how I get dressed if I'm still not allowed to bend (winter here, so tights or trousers essential). I really don't fancy carting my grabber into the changing room! Perhaps it's okay to break the 90 degree rule now? I think it wouldn't be wise to return to my aerobics class, but am I allowed to get down to floor level to do pilates? Any advice you've been given will be much appreciated. Thanks, Yvonne

"Hello hippies!
I had my first THR 9 years ago at the age of 50 in my right hip and it went perfectly from start to finish and is still perfect. On August 16th 2016 i had my left THR at the same hospital by the same very well known hip surgeon. here in Vancouver Canada.
I had the freezing with light sedation both times.
The freezing came out within 4 hours and the pain was horrific! I was put straight into a 24 hour monitoring unit where you have 1 nurse for 2 patients. They could not get my pain under control and it was horrible. I was eventually put onto a ward and they continued to try to get my pain under control which took another 24 hours.
I fainted on my first try to the bathroom and woke up on a backboard with about 20 medical people around me. i was terrified that my hip came loose but they assured me it did not. My horrible pain never let up. i ended up needing a blood transfusion and was in hospital for 8 days. When i went home i had my sister come to help me for a week because i was so weak and in so much pain i was scared to be alone. The pain was ridiculous and never let up. I knew something was wrong because i had my other hip done 9 years earlier with not 1 complication.
Fast forward a bit and a CT scan showed i had a fractured pelvis as well. i also have constant nerve pain from the groin into the femur.
I have heard that because i have OSTEO on top of my RA that it made my bones very fragile and that i was more at risk for this??? I call BS on that!! I have gone into hospital 3 different times for an ultrasound guided nerve block into my femur and it does help the horrible nerve pain and spasms for a few months. I was wondering if anyone else has had a broken pelvis from a THR?
Anyways thank you for listening.

"I would be really grateful to hear from anyone who has had a previous hip condition which is resulting in them now having a THR. My op is booked in for 15th Feb on NHS. Back in 1979 when i was 10 yrs old, I had osteomyelitis in my right hip, the op i had then involved taking out the diseased bone in the hip socket and I was then in full body plaster for 6 weeks, followed by 3 years of physio. I have always had a limp and limited movement in my hip. I was told I would need a THR by the time i was 30 yrs so have done quite well to get to 50 yrs. I guess im just worried quite what they are going to find when they open me up, the Dr I saw seemed to think it was strange that the diseased bone was removed. I guess im just fretting that its not going to be straight forward! Ive not seen my actual surgeon yet to put any of my concerns forward. Any responses would be gratefully received.

"I had my right hip replaced mid-June 2018 and things were going pretty well for me... however, over the past several months the pain was getting worse. I have had pain in my groin and every step I take it is like a shooting/pulling pain. I went to see the doctor about a month ago and he took an x-ray which looked good. He said it could be tendonitis/bursitis so I had an injection on my right and also had an injection on my left (since I also have pain there and will need a replacement on my left in a couple years). Physical therapy hasn't helped. As of last week my physical therapist said my right leg is a bit shorter than my left and that could be the cause of the pain. So, I have been wearing a heel lift and doing ""bridge"" exercises. After one week of this, no improvement. Thoughts?

"I had both hips replaced. First one in May 2016, followed by second in May 2018. I am physically fit, and upper body strength is good. Since the second hip replacement eight months ago, I have only used the shower, but would really like to start using my bathtub.
Does anyone know the safest means of exiting the bath? The first replacement was the right hip and the second - left. Means of exit would be from the left of the tub. Physio doesn't cover this due to lack of facilities. obviously. They suggest Social Services. The last thing I want is to have SS poking around in my life. I went through that with my Mother, and it was dire.
I have considered attempting it myself, fully dressed, but with bare feet, and leaving patio doors open and taking a phone into the bathroom with me, in case I become stuck, but am reluctant to attempt this without some sort of positive or negative feedback. Fear of dislocation, is of course, the main issue.

I feel my progress is very slow! I am walking in the house without my sticks but very slowly. My main problem is at night time, I cant get comfortable! although I am allowed to lay on my side with a pillow between my knees. I can lay only lay on unoperated side for so long, then I feel uncomfortable and struggle to get on my back because of the pain in my groin area on both sides. My operated side is still too painful to even contemplate laying on. I seem to have difficulty turning over or bending my legs. So I tend to sit up first and then try to get into a comfortable position moving my legs feels very painful in groin area, I can understand it being that way on the unoperated side but thought by now the operated side should be a lot easier! Perhaps its a bit early has anyone had the same problem? I am going for my check up on 29th January hopefully everything will be ok? My fear is that the surgery hasnt been a success????

This may sound like a weird question but had THR just 7 days ago and my foot seems to be walking at an angle. When i walk with the crutches my foot points to right instead of straight on.
One of the physios in the hospital said i needed to straighten my leg when i walk.
My own physio hadn't noticed it but when she saw me walk she said i was indeed turning my foot to the right, she said it was probably coming from when the tightened my muscle a little too tight when closing up.
Trying to walk straight when i think about it but my leg is still very swollen so wondering will this correct itself.

"Definitely one of the best decisions I made to get my THR January 8, 2018. First diagnosis of arthritis was about 6 years earlier when I thought I would just manage. (Not correct, but what did I know at the time?)
After experiencing constant pain and seeing my x-rays of ""bone on bone"" it wasn't hard to make the choice of drugs vs. surgery. With drugs, I could wait and have it done at our NY home area where we have lots of stairs or at our Florida home area where we had NO stairs. Not difficult to make that decision. I also didn't want to wait. I know some people will wait but I really wanted relief from the discomfort.
I have done well, but not everything is perfect. During my recovery I was doing well but not all of the surgical wound healed as it should. I needed to do constant wet/dry dressings with weekly doctor visits. Later I went into the hospital again for a planned procedure to reclose the wound but a wound pump was used instead. With the aid of a visiting nurse who changed the special dressing, the wound healed more quickly and I was declared healed.
I experienced numbness in my thigh (no pain) and it continues but only hurts when I either bump into something or one of my dogs jumps on that area. No idea if it will go away but I can manage. (I once had numbness in other thigh after a fall and it took a couple of years to feel better so I can hope for that.)
This forum helped so much from the beginning, after I made my decision. Helpful tips and comments from many helpful people who had already had THR. Great sounding board when I would get a little concerned with progress even though I knew that everyone recovers at a different pace.
I have tried my best to help others and will continue to do that. It's a ""play it forward"" kind of thing. Feels good if I can help someone as much as others helped me.
For anyone who is just starting out with plan for THR, ask your questions and share your concerns. Many people will answer and be of help.

"Hello lovely hippies.
I have been on the forum on and off for years and had my first hip replaced a couple of years ago. I had a couple of unusual problems, but it worked out in the end. Now my next one is coming up so soon (24th) I am becoming incredibly anxious even though I know it is a brilliant successful operation. Did you feel like this the second time around? Should I not be feeling more confident because I know how it works?
I have put this second THP off for so long already. The 'risks' of making it through the actual surgery is making me feel so stressed and so tearful. I was really terrified the first time, and you would think this time I would be less so. I am really struggling and wondered how you overcome this feeling?
I constantly remind myself of the positive outcome, but I can't get past the sense of rising panic again. I am crying sometimes out of the blue, everything feels very final and although rationally this is really not the way to approach things (I am usually very much a bright and positive soul) I can't help the way I feel about this particular surgery.
I have two children that I love deeply, and this is having such an impact on all of us, and I would do anything not to be in this position. I know I have to do this, but I am struggling.
Love Rose

"ITS SIX WEEKS SINCE I GOT MY NEW HIP ON RIGHT NEED OTHER ONE DOING AS WELL, I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT MY SECOND ONE IS GOING TO BE DONE ON THE 18th FEBRUARY! I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT 29th JANUARY FOR MY CHECK UP ON RIGHT HIP. I HAD A FEW PROBLEMS WITH LEAKAGE FROM THE WOUND SO HAD TO HAVE A DRAIN FITTED WHICH WAS RATHER CUMBERSOME!

I HAVE A DROPPED FOOT FROM NERVE DAMAGE AFTER HAVING THREE LOTS OF SURGERY ON MY BACK. ITS VITAL I WEAR AN ANKLE SUPPORT! IT GOT LOST IN THE HOSPITAL AND I BELIEVE THE WOUND LEAKAGE WAS CAUSED BECAUSE OF HAVING TO PUT TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON MY NEW HIP!

"I had a THR May 20, 2015. Here it is 2018 and I am still in pain. I can't put weight on my leg or it goes into severe cramping and I am paralyzed wherever I am. It is so bad that I scream instinctively. I can't put my full weight on my leg or it will seize up and I will fall to the ground. I've had quite a bit of imaging done but none of the doctors I've been to can see the problem. I don't even know where to turn anymore. I am 55 and I feel like my life is that of what I thought it would be be at 85 maybe... as I was fairly active before and enjoyed outdoor activities such as hiking, kayaking, etc. (I live in Alaska). I have seen the best doctors here in Alaska. They both said they never would have operated on me, once they saw my original imaging. Apparently it wasn't bone on bone like my surgeon ""pointed"" out to me when he encouraged me to have the surgery. I wish I would never have had it. Another problem I have is I don't have full range of motion. If I sit on the floor with my feet together and knees bent, I can lay my bent right knee/leg out to the side and without pain, I can't move my left bent leg at all without pain and can't get past a few inches without so much resistance and pain that it is not physically possible. I need a team to look at me or a ""super doctor"". All they tell me is to go see a pain doctor.... I want to know what the real cause of the pain is and have it fixed.... Thank You to anyone that sees this and thinks of any doctors that could be helpful or any clinic, or if you or someone you know has also had this problem with weight' bearing and severe cramping.

"Hi Folks - I can't believe it's been 15 days since surgery. I have to say that compared to having both knees replaced in 9/2/2011, this procedure was brutal. When I had my knees replaced, I woke up without an ounce of pain, nor during my entire hospital stay of one week. The day after knee replacement, they had me out of bed and by the end of the week I was transported via ambulance to in-patient rehab. RTHP, I came out of surgery and the pain was agonizing. I felt as though I had been attacked by a shark. I had not expected to be in incredible pain, and it took quite some time to get my pain under control. I did not sleep the first night and the following day I hit a brick wall and had a total meltdown. Because I live alone, the surgeon kept me for a 2 night stay. My younger son came to see me and said ""Mom, I have to take a hard stand on this, you can't go home in this condition."" All I could do was sob in between trying to tell him that I didn't want to go to rehab.
Thank God I listened to reason and he persevered in getting me in Kessler Rehab (Christopher Reeves, a/k/a/ Superman, did his rehab at Kessler). He drove me, bc an ambulance would cost over $800. My first day at Kessler, I think I was in a state of shock. I was unable to weight bear, could not go to the bathroom by myself, nor dress myself. The second day after breakfast, and the aid helping me get dressed, PT came and I was wheeled away. I will forever be grateful to the staff at Kessler, from the janitor, aids, nurses, doctors and physical therapists. Knowing that I'm a dog lover and having my own 2 dogs, my PT arranged for me to have a 20 minute session with a therapy dog, a golden retriever. I was in heaven, especially after he fell asleep on my belly and began snoring. I had been very active until I began having pain in my hip, knee and back. I loved going to PT and they told me that they knew I would not be in rehab for too long. They said some spend weeks in bed before they get out of bed. I was in rehab for 8 days and came home on Saturday, January 5th. While in rehab I couldn't wait to get my green card, which meant I could leave my room. I think by day 4, PT gave me my green card.
I've now been home for 5 days and I continue to grow stronger. I had stopped taking pain meds in rehab, but realized that I was white knuckling the pain, so I now have a prescription which I use sparingly, but once I sense the pain coming, I take half a pill. I'm no longer using the walker, just the cane. I could have had an aid twice a week to help me shower, but 2 days after being home, I took a shower sitting on my seat from when I had my knees done. I told them that I would not be needing an aide. Both of my dogs have been with my younger son in Philadelphia - I live in NJ. My son brought my 11 month old dog, Randall, home on Tuesday and Randall has been like a therapy dog. My son will keep 3 yr old Stella for a while longer until I grow stronger.
Thank God I am sleeping - Randall at my side. I sleep on my back with a pillow under my right leg. I live in a 3-story townhouse and have not had difficulty navigating the stairs. Also, a little common sense goes a long way. I wear clothing with lots of pockets, so I can bring whatever I have to upstairs and downstairs. I move slower and when I get tired, I take a rest. I had thought I was getting Anterior Hip Replacement, but got the other, which means no more than a 90 degree bend for 5-6 months. I'll have in-home PT twice a week for a few more weeks and then will probably go to out-patient to strengthen my leg and get rid of my limp. When I walk with my cane, I make sure my tummy is tucked in and my posture is good.
Thanks to all for contributing to this forum . . . I have learned a lot!

I am nearly 7 weeks post op on a revised left hip replacement. I am completely mobile indoors without sticks . I am still using one stick outdoors but trying to walk mainly without using it and walking between 2-3 miles at least twice a day. I have increased my physio exercises and and last week i went swimming twice walking in the pool and doing a little leg kicking and a little swimming.
But the last few days I have had a lot of pain in my lower back. I cant remember from last time if this is normal. I think maybe my gait is still a bit off and tried yesterday to hold myself more upright and hold my abs in. Has anyone else experienced this . It is starting to get to me as both hips are a little sore and up until a few days ago I felt i was starting to make progress.

"I could really use hearing a few success stories and then also hearing that I, alone, aren't experiencing something like this.
I am almost 6 weeks post op and I feel so mentally weak. I'm starting to regret having done this surgery. I feel so uncomfortable in everything I do, be it standing, sitting and worst of all...sleeping. I feel as though an intruder is in my body and I let him in. Nothing feels comfortable anymore. I especially can't get comfortable in bed, is this common? I put pillows under my to ""help"" but I've still lost ridiculous amounts of sleep. Yes, i take my pain killers to help with pain and sleep, unfortunately, its helping none. Does it get more comfortable?? Will I feel normal later?? Or is this something I'll always feel isn't part of me. My scar was also healing beautifully and is now infected, so that's fun. My leg lengths are different and I was promised, if it happened, it'd be "" unnoticeable""... I definitely notice. It's making me limp as I try to walk, I'm now getting pain in my NON operated leg and hip. Does that sort itself out too, or will that always stay?? I feel so down in the dumps and I keep reading stories that people are still limited and having dislocations even past 10 months! I guess I'm hitting a low and I'm hoping that someone, anyone, can lift my spirits a little by sharing.
I'm glad this forum exists and I wish you all good health!

"Hello there
I am now 10 days post op and until 2 days ago was feeling well and on track with recovery, according to the hospital and online opinions..doing my exercises and walking a little with 2 crutches...the swelling is also gradually reducing. Two nights ago, I got up to use the bathroom to realise I couldn't put my leg down as putting the weight through it caused excrutiating pain..yesterday I spent the day resting it and taking more and heavier pain relief. In the night I was woken by burning pain in my heel and sharp pain on the front of my foot across the toes..I am still unable to put any weight through the leg due to severe pain. I'm obviously a little worried and disappointed as I had been doing so well...has any one any ideas?...should I be resting it or moving it?..thank you in advance for your thoughts..

"FIRST please no horror stories.
Second, I'm already a HIPPIE, I've had two THRs, the most recent in Oct 2018, therefore I already know how those go and the pain level and bruising (both went off without a hitch) now I'm a newbie all over again with a TKR. I reaped a wealth of information from this site during my first hip surgery process and was very thankful.
Now I am looking for accurate information on what to expect from a total knee replacement (TKR) and any helpful information for before (7 weeks away from surgery now) and tips / tricks at home. How did the pain during recovery vary between the two surgeries (if both were successful)?
I have heard the recovery time and effort for a knee are harder but I don't know WHAT that means or what to expect.
I have already started my length strengthening exercises.
Thanks
PS I'm posting here because the knee forum is mostly all negative or horror stories - I do not want to read those B4 surgery (I'm sure you can appreciate that).

"My surgery is scheduled 12/26 and I become more fretful each day. As I mentioned, I am a 66 yr old widow living with my 2 dogs. Had my pre-op on 12/12 and HSS called me because they didn't have my CAT scan. I was signed in, saw the internist, went to education and was told I could leave. No one said a thing about a CAT scan. Now I have to go back this Friday. They're are also looking for a hematology report that was sent to them on 12/13. Just adds to my anxiety and frustration. I purchased all my supplies, two raised toilet seats, flexible ice pack that can be heated or frozen, a 4"" pillow to keep me raised and a 5 piece tool set including a device to put on socks. I already have a seat for my shower.
My question, for those who have dogs. How long did you have to wait before you could actually walk them? They'll be with my sitter and my son. I'm just looking at timelines. Thanks all!

"Hello all,
Had a very small fall in my house today, slipped on a step,fell on my back. My leg with the THR went out straight I think. There isn't any pain, my good leg took the force I think. I assume I would know if I had damaged the replacement or it had moved at all? Feel very annoyed with myself for not taking more care. I am over 7 weeks post op. My lower back hurts but that is from straining and using the golfing stance to pick up things off the floor.
Sorry to sound like a worrier but don't want to go backwards in my recover.

"My THR was 14 long months ago. From day one I had a 1"" leg discrepancy which my surgeon said I shouldn't notice. Well I most certainly did. I went to all my post OP appointments telling hip my leg gives out, I'm in pain and he blamed it on my back. So long story short, he dismissed all my problems and told me to see my back surgeon, which I did. He ordered all the necessary tests, MRI, nerve conduction test, etc. Nothing indicated that it was coming from my back. I knew I needed a second opinion and knew I wouldn't get one in my area.
Since then I found one. He right away dismissed my leg length discrepancy. I flip flopped between hip and back doctor at that facility . Nothing indicated , yet again that there was anything wrong.
I was still having pain in my hip, that went across my thigh to my knee. my leg would randomly give out. I had a sore spot on my hip at my incision sight that was painful to the touch. I went from a dull ache to throbbing pain. I couldn't walk very far or stand long. I was completely at wits end. I was in more pain now than before surgery. I even went to a foot doctor because my opposite foot was starting to give me problems. I tried heat, ice, rest, massage ....nothing helped. Sleeping was horrible.
FINALLY after trying just about everything, I spoke to a family friend who also had problems after his THR. He told me he also had pain and a leg length discrepancy and that he went to his Chiropractor and he fixed him. I was skeptical . But what did I have to lose? He said the procedure is like hocus pocus . He apparently uses a clicker instead of twisting you into a pretzel to adjust you. So I made and appointment.
I am amazed! I went this past Friday. I NO longer have leg or thigh pain and I'm EVEN ! I walk without a limp and can go up steps without a problem. I no longer have that sore spot on my incision sight and my leg hasn't given out yet! He "" clicked"" me in four spots. My temple, the base of my skull, my dowagers hump and my tail bone. HE fixed me for $32.OO!!! AFTER 14 months of horrible pain and numerous test and doctors appointments, time and money...... a chiropractor with a metal clicker fixed what they couldn't . To say I am shocked is an understatement . I finally have my life back! It's the best Christmas blessing ever!

"Hi Everyone! I'm one week post op and feeling great overall. Had THR with no complications. I'm up and about, limping, but getting stronger every day. My first question is this: every now and then, if I move a certain way (involving my glute muscle) I get a burning sensation on my thigh just below the incision (lateral) covering about a 3cm by 3cm surface area. It feels like someone has splashed me with scalding/boiling water. The feeling only lasts a few seconds as long as I relax and try to rub it out. Obviously it's some kind of nerve pain on the surface. My nurse said not to worry, that all the nerves will need to ""regenerate"" or something like that. Has anyone else had this type of pain? Does it go away at some point? It literally takes my breath away every time it happens!
Second question: about how many minutes a day are you supposed to be up and about throughout the day? My nurse said, as much as tolerable, but what does this mean? I am walking around the house a few times each day, doing stairs with alot of support from the railings, and doing my exercises; however, the majority of my day is still spent in bed, with ice packs. Do I need to be up and moving more? Thanks for your insights!

Has anyone else had to deal with a post surgical fracture? nobody can really tell me how long this will take to heal, they plan to leave the bone fragment loose so at least i dont have more surgery to contend with... lots of different opinions from surgeons, physio and GP but in real life what should i expect?

"Hi!I had a total right hip replacement at the end of January this year,I have had my hip x rayed and all is well.But ever since i started to walk without my crutches-about 5 months ago,ive been having back pain,lowerback,between the middle of back to right hip.I walk my dogs 3 times a day,one long walk and 2 half hour walks,of course they love a ball thrown for them-trouble is,after a few throws,the very localised pain becomes sharp and it takes me a while to stand up from a bending position(picking the ball up)-I fear i may be stuck bent over some day! this pain also happens after housework,any exertion really.i could feel a ""grating"" at its worst so had an x ray done-came back""no further action required""i had to wait about 3 months to see my physio who has given me exersises-ive been doing them for 4 weeks now and everything is still the same,in fact,i think its the exercises causing my hip to hurt as well.it also seems to be getting worse as before i could get through half the day pain free ,but its been quite painful already this morning-one has to bend!(a million times a day,it seems!) has anyone any ideas,please? thanks in advance

"Have been recovering well from a total hip replacement for four weeks during which have been walking daily. However have now developed back pain. This started initially in my lower back, no surprise really as have had to manage my back for years by avoiding being too stationary. Have degenerative changes particularly in lower back. However now developed pain in mid and upper back and thinking this could be due to having to sleep on my back and prolonged sitting. Hurts when I breathe and can get pain under ribs too.
Anyone else experienced back pain and if so what helped?

"After a year of discomfort and pain I'm finally scheduled for a hip replacement. i'm in my 70s and live alone. i have a number of fears which the hospital has not attempted to dispel.
i was expecting a general anaesthetic but will be having a spinal tap and will be conscious throughout. This just induces panic.
i've also been told that I will be discharged the day after the operation which worries me hugely.
i don't have any relations living in this part of the country and noone who could stay with me.
i worry about getting out of bed in the night and making it to the toilet using crutches.
Everything I've read about compression hose implies great difficulty in putting them on and off. The videos I've seen have people bending down or crossing their legs or twisting their foot, all of which I've been told I shouldn't do.
I'm sorry this is all so negative and would love to be reassured by anyone who had experience of such anxieties.

"I was so afraid of needing to take opiates after this surgery but am now pleasantly surprised! I only took the Oxys for 2 days. The main reason for stopping on my own was the constipation and fear of becoming dependent on them. I have managed successfully with just taking Indomethacin (which is a NSAID, much stronger than Ibuprofen) and Extra Strength Tylenol, both 3 times a day. I am 7 days PostOp and ready to start slowly on the treadmill today. Sleeping is surprisingly easy. The only complaint I have is some sporadic burning nerve pain on the surface of my thigh when my glute/butt muscle is moved in a certain way. This pain is short-lived but somewhat frequent. I'm hoping it goes away on it's own soon!

"HI there Hippies
I'd just like to announce that my new hip is 1 year old today and share a few observations for those about to welcome a new hip or already sporting a young prosthesis.
My right posterior THR was performed here in the UK on 17th November 2017. Operation was conducted with a spinal block under sedation. I experienced some discomfort post op but this was well managed with medication. I also need to have a catheter inserted for 24hrs as my bladder would not function naturally due to the residual effects of the spinal block. That however resolved quite quickly and I was discharged on the 3rd day with pain meds, laxatives to counter the effects of the codeine and heparin self-injection kits to counteract potential blood clots (DVT). This was a welcome alternative to the torture of surgical stockings.
I had previously attended a ""Hippies Tutorial"" sponsored by the Physiotherapy department so I had the exercise regime to hand and all the necessary physical aids such as crutches, a perching stool, toilet frame, grabber, leg lifting strap etc to make coping at home more easy.
The first couple of weeks was quite challenging. I did experience a fair bit of swelling to my operated leg - particularly around my ankle. However that subsided eventually and progress was good thereafter.
I was able to drive again after 3 weeks due to my car being an automatic and my new hip being on the left (no clutch pedal to worry about). Only real problem was finding parking spaces where I could get the car door open fully to allow me easy access while my hip was less flexible and the 90 degree rule was in effect. As an aside I wish the UK authorities would allow new hippies to have a temporary blue (disabled) badge so that we could use those wider parking spots for a few weeks until our flexibility improves.
I managed to ditch my crutches after about 5 weeks and then relied on a walking stick when outdoors. I did experience a quantum leap in fitness and flexibility after I returned to cycling regularly in April - maybe 3 - 4 times a week with distances between 6 and 15 miles. I would seriously urge others out there to at least try some regular low impact exercise like that as a means to speeding up their recovery.
12 months on I am now back to normal in terms of flexibility and mobility. I still occasionally get slight pins and needles in my operated leg and the odd ache in my hip area if I sit too long in one position ( a 6hr drive from Scotland in September being a case in point)
For all of you about to enter the Hippy club or for those recently signed up - keep an optimistic outlook. In general things will resolve themselves in time and remember keep doing those exercises

I can walk without crutches but only around the house and using one I find is causing a painful back and side muscles. I did see its been a problem to some of you too. My concern is after lying or sitting down my hip is quite sore ....sort of around the socket when standing up. After a couple of steps it eases. Has anyone else experienced this? I have had intense anxiety during this period and seem to have developed IBS which hasn't been fun. I see my surgeon on Monday for my first check up but in the meantime....help! Thanks for a great site.

"Hi all,
I am 13 weeks post op for a left hip replacement. recovery is going fairly well, although I do still have muscle pain walking. Not bad pain mind you. Anyway, my GP suggests continuing to take Tylenol or Ibuprofen as needed. I remember I took ibuprofen for quite a while after my hip scope many years ago... but can't remember exactly how long.
So I am curious to hear from those who have been through a hip replacement already. how long did you take over the counter pain killers like Tylenol or Ibuprofen on both a regular basis, and on an as needed basis?
Cheers

"Hi there. As the title says really. I don't think mine is going particularly bad at the moment but would like to hear about all the aches and pains that people are facing, probably to put my paranoid mind at rest! I had a pretty terrible first night at home the third day after the op as they only prescribed me paracetamol to take home. I had previously been on Tramadol for hip pain so they assumed that I should just take that. Had to call the GP who kindly gave me a script for two bottles of oral morphine to tide me over the first week or so. I've been taking less than prescribed with the Tramadol in between as and when. I have been sleeping in four hour slots it seems and when not sleeping I've been tenderly sitting. The obvious problem is the incision site hurting and getting comfortable. It appears that my leg prefers to be bent at the knee whilst laying down and my hamstring is really tight. i get a pulling or cramping sometimes when attempting to lay down or sit up. this is resolved by me bending my knee it goes quickly then i can straighten again. I'm paranoid that I'm not sleeping in the correct posture and that my muscles will mend in a haphazard fashion! I did have some pain at the acetabular site for one day and it was as though i couldn't weight bare. this seems to be resolved, think i over did it the day before. A few times it's felt that I've popped the hip out when made a mistake with bending or whatever and then I'm concentrating on every little niggle! I've not done any of the exercises in the booklet i was given and will prob start with them today. (in hope it will settle the hamstring out) I do realise that I've had major surgery with bone and muscle cut etc. amazing really how quick we heal afterwards.
very long post i know but wanted to know how other people are getting on. no two people are the same but just for some reassurance probably.
should change my username to MrParanoiaUK42!

"Good Afternoon All,
I wanted to thank everyone for being so supportive of me before my THR surgery as I was had so much anxiety and depression that I had been dealing with due to being so fearful of having this surgery performed.
My surgery went extremely well as I did have a spinal with medication to totally knock me as I only remember being wheeled into surgery and waking up in recovery. The only pain that I did experience was later that evening the day of my surgery and I was given some pain medication.
Physical therapy had me an using the walker the next day and I went home that Friday September 14th. I was so apprehensive about going home due all of the hip precautions that I almost afraid of moving.
The home health Physical Therapy came out the next day to discuss my plan for therapy for the next three weeks, I also had Occupational therapy for the same time as well.
I did the exercises that I was given to do and each time the therapist came out I was given more exercises along with being shown how to go up and down the few stairs in the kitchen ( luckily everything in my house is on one level except for the basement) and get in and out of the car safely.
I then started outpatient physical therapy on October 3rd and have been going twice a week for an hour each time and have a few more visits to go. Been given more and more challenging exercises to do which I also still do at home.
Stopped using the walker about 2 weeks ago and now only using the cane to help me walk.
Have been walking outside for longer period times .
My only issues are the stiffness that I do experience in my right leg and also I am still limping slightly when walking with the cane and have been trying to walk without any assistance in the house. I am hoping that the limping will eventually stop as I would like to be able to walk like I normally did before my OA.
I was told that it just takes time due to the muscles needing to be strengthened as I do hope so as I really didn't go through all of this not to be able to walk without limping as there are so many things that I would like to be able to do again once my recovery is complete.

"I had a THR to my right hip just over a year ago. Recovery has been steady and I've largely been pleased with progress, although I have been experiencing twinges around my thigh/knee. Last week I decided to join a local Health Walk (having completed one with no problems the week before) but I experienced real pain in that general area of thigh & knee which worsened considerably during the 3m walk, and although this improved when I rested, the pain returned when I had a longish walk around the town a couple of days later and is definitely 'there' during daily activities. I know I have early OA in my knees but do not know if this latest pain is likely to be caused by my right knee or is a problem with the operated hip. Has anyone else experienced this? And any advice on specific exercises to help would be welcome. Many thanks.

She told me they recommend having a spinal in addition to a general because the morphine will stay in my system for a while after surgery and aid with pain relief.
is this a common practice? i despise spinals and think it may hinder my immediate movement after surgery, but the only reference i have personally is from having c-sections.
Ultimately its my decision, but I'm interested in what others experiences have been and whether this is the right way to go?

"Hi Everyone,
I had a THR back in February and do manual work for a living.
My company and management were excellent in helping me through and everything seemed to be going alright as by June I was back doing normal tasks but struggled a bit at the beginning.
As time went on it started to feel stronger but then it seemed to start hurting again causing me to limp quite a lot.
About a month or so ago I was trying to move something heavy when the hip kind of went into a spasm and I thought something bad had happened.
It went away after a few minutes and I cautiously finished my days work.
The next couple of days I was off it was simply hurting to walk around.
Long story short went to the doctors, sent for xrays, hip all okay.
Problem I have now is I am signed off work and don't really know what to do or where I stand as far as moving forward in my current job.....it does seem like the job is aggravating the hip.
Has anyone been in a similar position and what did you do?

Uptil till then i had never given my hip any thought from one check up to the next.
The letter says
'Xrays show well fixed femoral component in relation to the acetabular components, there may be some movement in the cup and this will be removed in 6 months' time with further x rays'

"I had bilateral hip replacement in November of 2016. Everything went well and I have recovered nicely. The only problem I have had is that I have pain in my left hip when I flex it. The right one is fine. Getting in a car, raising the leg to get in bed, or raising the knee has caused a slight pain since almost the beginning (after surgery). The leg has felt heavy also. I mentioned it to the doctor several times but he didn't see anything obvious on the x ray. I have been coping with it because the slight pain is nothing compared to the old arthritic pain. It just made me a little clumsy. I researched it and came to the conclusion that I had iliopsoas impingement, where the psoas muscle rubs against the artificial cup, irritating it. Fast forward to yesterday, almost two years since my operation. I was getting out of my truck. I moved my left leg out of the truck a little differently than normal and I felt a strange sensation that I haven't felt before. I was a little worried about the hardware moving or shifting but it felt more like a muscle strain. It was a little difficult to walk, but I forced myself to do so because I had to work. Throughout the day it was a little annoying but got better towards the end of the workday. When I went to bed last night I noticed that there was no pain when I lifted the leg into bed! When I got up today, there was no pain. Getting in and out of the truck today, climbing the ladder (I'm a painter), and lifting my leg feels great! I'm hypothesizing but I think the pain I have been feeling for two years was a badly positioned psoas muscle or tendon. Maybe done during the operation. Maybe when I got out of the truck, the odd movement I made caused the muscle/tendon to shift back to a more normal position which relieved the pain. I'm excited because this is the first time in two years where the left hip feels normal. I thought I would share this with you to see if anyone has heard of something like this happening before? I'm enjoying the pain free hip, hoping it doesn't move into the other, painful position.

"Hi everyone. I just had a full right hip replacement (anterior approach). I'm thrilled because I can tell that familiar joint pain is gone. However, I have so much swelling and bruising from my groin down to my knee and it makes everything very uncomfortable - (walking, getting out of bed, sitting). Has anyone had a drain inserted during a hip replacement? It almost feels like most of pain is coming from where my drain was due to intense bruising midway down and across my thigh/quad making it very painful to walk. Nothing is infected and the drain site and incision are healing nicely. It will
be one week tomorrow. I'm curious to know what others experienced.

"Hi all,  
I am having sharp pain (level of about 6) in the front of my hip (hip crease) when bearing weight.  I will rest for a couple of days, litterally doing very little and it stops hurting.  But the if I walk about a  a mile, the pain come back.  It is odd because it is not always there.  The am not sure if I should contact my surgeon or not as I had my 6 week post op and he said things looks great.  Wondering if it muscular of the implant.  Anyone else go through this with their THR?
Currently I am only taking Tylenol or Advil, but was given a muscle relaxant that I am considering taking.  Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks

"Hello!
So, I'm looking for some advice. My father has been told he is going to need a hip replacement in about 3 months. I live in the USA and my dad lives on his own in the UK. I will fly back to help him for about 3 weeks, but due to my job I  may not be able to stay much longer than that. Realistically, will he still need help after that or, assuming we get him everything he needs, will he be ok for the rest of his recovery? I have no issue getting someone to come in and help when he needs it, but he's pretty stubborn and probably won't want anyone.
Other than his hip issues (arthritic, not broken), he's in great health, so I don't foresee any major issues with his recovery.
Any advice would be good!

"Surprisingly little about this subject here, and i have conflicting information about leg elevation with regards hip precautions post-op.
I am now 8 days post-op and my leg is looking like a baby elephant, the last two nights having spread to my foot which I'm finding very painful. nowhere in my information from the hospital do they recommend elevation, just ice every two hours for 20 mins which i am doing, two hours bed rest which i am doing, 4xphysio exercises per day and plenty of walking, which i am doing. The swelling stay pretty much the same but gets worse in the evenings. The ""reading matter"" categorically states, "" do not use a footstool"", ""do not use a reclining chair"". Some of your resources mention people sleeping in a recliner, and sitting with the leg up? Seems to me that having you leg up while sitting would cause you to break two rules very easily, i.e. leg more than 90 degrees to hip and knee higher than hip. Any suggestions?

"so I'm a couple weeks away from my year anniversary. Last November I had my left hip replaced. I woke up from surgery with foot drop. Spent four days in hospital with doctor telling me he thought it could be the spinal block then he wasnt sure what happened but my tendon must have gotten stretched. Sent me home I received three days of at home physical therapy. Yes 3 days then they released me and i went back to work within two weeks. Ive had pain in my groin and the nerve pain was pretty unbearable for awhile but has gotten better. Now my other leg hurts Im sure from compensating for not being able to walk right. I do where a brace now, I've had the nerve tests done its just dead no response. Im 52 years old and a heavy equipment mechanic which im finding increasingly difficult to do my job. The surgeon has suggested a tendon transfer surgery now. This is the only surgery ive ever had and it didnt go so well so I'm apprehensive to say the least. Plus Im in the US I cant afford another 10-12 thousand out of pocket for another surgery. Im just at a loss for what to do.

"Firstly apologies for not posting until now. i couldn't hold attention on anything longer than a nano-second in hospital!
The staff were superb and couldn't do enough to help, a superb example of the nhs doing such an amazing job.
I am 51 and was in a ward of 80-90 year olds, and i soon found they were all coping and recuperating much faster than me. I was ""sick"", whereas they were recovering from a minor operation!. My surgeon finally told me on day 4 that ""the younger you are, the longer it takes to recover, initially"". Which I found somewhat bizarre, but offers me some hope.
Some observations in order to help others:
Pain relief. You HAVE to tell them what you are feeling, otherwise they don't know. Some patients seemed to get by on paracetamol. They couldn't find anything strong enough to control MY pain: paracetamol might as well have been tic-tacs, oxycodone just made me hot and dizzy. IV morphine sent me on a psychedelic trip, as did tramadol which also made me vomit. The anaesthetist said the pain blocks would last 12 hours, i had pain immediately on coming around from sedation. The ONLY pain relief that actually worked was Oromorph, so this was written up every 2 hours.
Constipation. I have just been since Friday morning (6 days) after 4 days on Movicol. The hospital was not proactive with laxatives, so i would keep asking.
Physio. Lets face it, all you want to do is sleep. All they want is you walking and sitting. I found sitting in a chair THE most uncomfortable position, and still long for my 2 hours in bed in the afternoons, and as long as possible in bed at night. I know you have to do what they say, but it is very hard work.
Coming home. Is bliss, however you will have set- backs, and you will be petrified of dislocation. i have already pulled my elephant leg over my good one, totally crossing them, and last night I spilled my urine bottle all over the floor and twisted badly by reflex action to try to stop myself spilling it. Meds are different at home, and to manage the pain i am having to take more than what is prescribed, due to massive pain breakthroughs at around 2am and 5am.
Enough for now, try to get some sleep!

The good news : I am 'good to go', can do whatever I like now, gym, cycling, even golf  (provided I take it gently).  No restrictions !
The left photo shows the mess inside my leg when the ceramic 'exploded' inside, notice the angle of the metal shell. On the right, my new cleaned-up leg, new hip and no screws needed this time as the fit is better.

"hi all
honestly can,t thank you all enough for everyone who replied to my previous post. I really would like to find someone who has had an arthrodesis prior to making an going through with a thr operation to try an get some idea of whats ahead. l certainly don,t mean to offend but i am only wanting to speak to someone who has done the change over from a fused, arthrodesised hip to a full replacement thanks. I wouldn't be overly concerned nowadays in going in for a hip replacement if that is just what it was.
When your going over from an arthrodesis to a thr , i think this is a total new field for the doctor. For instance i have 3 broken screws in my mid femur area where the shaft of the hip replacement needs to go. that's one concern. num 2 is there is 7 rods that penetrate the femur into the pelvis to fuse the joint. they've been there for 33 years now an wonder how they will come out. With a bit of trouble i would imagine.
I have asked my doctor these questions an got satisfactorily answers. It's easy for anyone to say anything but when it's being done to yourself, it's a different kettle of fish so to speak. My op is in 4 weeks an am desperately trying to find someone who has gone from arthrodesis to thr.
So please only reply if you have gone through what i am about to go through, thanks kindly to all your previous replies. Just on another note i stumbled across an interesting show on the netflix channel. It's called (The bleeding), i would of much prefered to watch it after my op i think an not before.
Anyway thanks again to all, rgds ian

"Hi all. I致e been following this great forum since my THR done 3 months ago. I was surprised to feel,that my operated hip seemed to leave my leg very slightly  longer.  Maybe 1/4 of an inch? talked to my. 
surgeon about it several times and he gave a somewhat convoluted explanation that both legs were measured carefully and were the same length. He suggested that because the unoperated hip was not in great shape, it affected the way that that  leg connected to it. in other words the hips weren稚 aligned but the legs were equal. He said, no heel lifts and that I should give my body time to settle in to the my new hip. Meantime I致e got a slight side to side gait which my family says they barely see.  This discrepancy has caused my lower back to hurt and sometimes my knees too. Is this a common phenomenon and should I just wait and hope for the best. Before thr I limped in pain and now I have another little limp. I want to be not only pain free but limp,free too. Am I too vain?

"My problem is my hip is not sore every step I take. I had my left hip replaced in February this year it also wasn稚 particularily sore but it was very stiff, my surgeon said it was in the process of seizing up. He couldn稚 even move it when I was under anaesthetic and had a little up-and-down movement and that was it. It was sore years ago but that pain went away , the reason I had it fixed was the impact it was having on my ability to function. That replacement was a great success I was able to do at least 10,000 steps a day until my right hip got irritated by all the extra activity. On xray it is also arthritic with spurs and cysts, so do I get it replaced soon so I can exercise or do I wait till it gives me more pain?
It is sore lifting it into the car, walking up steps and if I sit on a low seat it will lock up which is very painful. I don稚 know when it will lock up which is very painful and embarassing. but it doesnt lock up everyday .
I am worried that moments of pain and unpredictable locking up isnt enough to warrant another big operation. I am booked in for the 5th of November, I am surprised it is no easier to choose to get it done second time around.
I am 60 years old, 45 pounds lighter than when I first saw my surgeon and still working and healthy. My head says get it fixed and be active but then I worry in case it goes badly. I see posts here of people being so disabled by hip pain they are on canes or walkers and it makes me feel I am not that badly off so why am I having a big operation?

"Wow! Finally have a chance to write about how happy I am after taking first long trip (Dublin and Scotland) since my THR. We decided to not rush into a trip, giving me plenty of time to have full recovery, knowing there would probably be a lot of walking. I was so amazed how wonderful it was to no longer have the hip pain like I did last year at this time on a similar trip. I still have some thigh numbness but it's been more manageable as time goes on with less need for icing. I did have my Flipstick (cane that turns into a seat you lean back on) just because I knew I might get tired. Since my knee decided to do its best to get my attention (I know have arthritis there), it helped a lot.
I expected the extra ""wanding"" during checkin for our flights. Each airport was different. At the first one, when I told them about my new hip, the person who wanded/did pat down, actually asked me if there was any area that was especially sensitive (my thigh), she was very careful. In all the times we flown and I've occasionally had to have the patdown (no idea why), no one has ever been as nice/gentle. We're never in a rush, so no big deal about the extra time (couple of minutes) it takes for me to clear security.
I even managed well during the high winds when we were in Dublin on September 19 with the side effects of Helene. Crossing O'Connell Street was ""interesting"" at the time.
No issue with steps which was good since while we were in Scotland, we stayed in an apartment on the second floor (which meant lots of steps since the Ground Floor was where we entered.
Good to be back and reading about how everyone is doing. Big surprise about the ""new look"" of the site. I'll get used to it.

"I am at the first stages of arranging a hip replacement - and I understand there are two main routes a surgeon can take into the hip. The good old tried and tested route is posterior - but this maybe easier for the surgeon but requires quite an amount of postop discipline by the patient, sleeping on the back, not bending the leg, etc. But I understand there to be a more modern method, the Anterior route, which requires almost no postop discipline, and can be done almost on a day patient basis. But how do I find a surgeon who can and will do Anterior ?? I have tried to find and contact a number of surgeons but receive meaningless or no reply - and I don't want to pay out for any number of consultations only to find I am speaking to the wrong person.
So the question - how do I find a surgeon in middle England who can and will do a hip replacement using the Anterior approach ??

"So today is the day. I get to go back to the vets for him to look at the first hip and I'm not sure what to expect.
My other hip has been playing up and painful no where near o the extent of my right but it still worries me and I'd actually rather get it done sooner than rather due to being self employed.
I have ankilysing spondalytis so the reality is.. chop one bit off another bit gets attacked... Can they just replace my pelvis... Lol or my blood.
My goal had been to loose three stone in the last year it's not happened due to eating issues like not eating for days then eating normally (not excessively). I'm strong I do yoga weights walk etc but I can't do cardio and if I wake up with chornic nerve pain or fatigue I can't really do much other than try to stay active and get through half an hour to 40 kind of something.
So I'm really worried about looking like a failure or something daft in front of the surgeon. How has everyone else's first year check up been? Xxx

"Hi guys
I have started writing and deleted this post several times each time telling myself that I need to man up! 8 weeks today I had my right hip replaced it痴 been a up and down experience which I knew it would be. I just don稚 think I realised how very hard it would be mentally. I take meds for depression have done for several years and in that time I致e had a few blips usually when I致e tried to wean myself off them so in the end I came to realise that I need them and have been stable with them since then. This operation which I really needed should be a fresh start but I feel so low I feel ungrateful because I致e had it done and I知 moaning I feel guilty because I can稚 catch up on the housework my head feels overflowing of rubbish! Admittedly I have a lot of stress at home with 5 children my dads has unoperable cancer my husband has young onset Parkinson痴 which is controlled but has changed his personality but I usually cope ok I see my surgeon for my 8 week check Friday and I need my left hip replacing next if he suggests it soon do I agree and get it over with or do I tell him how I知 feeling and risk getting it put off and possibly having to wait a long time as it gets worse? I just feel as if I could curl up and hide somewhere. Is this usual has anyone else gone through anything like this.

However, I have been eating normally since then and the weight loss stopped. I had gone from 57k to 55k. No problem. I was glad when it didn't go any further but I weighed this morning and I was 54.7k. Not a lot, I know, but I'm slim to start with so don't want to lose any more.

"Hi all!
Have now had my TLHR almost 4 weeks ago and am doing really well in recovery.  I had the anterior approach.  I am even walking at times without the cane entirely and doing fine with that.  My PT encourages me to do that around the house.  The only problem I'm having is with my ankle pain.  Strange, as I never did have that with my TRHR 2 years ago.  It's a strange feeling, almost a 'weak pain' as I can best describe it.  But I finally figured out it's beginning in my gluteous maximus (sp?....rear end) and traveling down the back side of my leg to my ankle.  The PT has stretched and worked on all of those muscles and I'm thinking possibly it could just be muscular and even maybe ligaments that have been stretched. My Orthopedic Surgeon also had to put a slightly longer ball into that socket in order to make my legs even.  He seemed to do that pretty well as I feel more even now, but I'm wondering if it will just take time for everything to settle into place and for the muscles and ligaments to adjust?  Any thoughts?  Anyone else experience anything like this?  Thanks for your input!

"I had a spinal injection with sedation for a total hip replacement.  The injection, on either side of my spine was extremely uncomfortable, if not painful, and I was made to wait until the entire lower part of my body was numb.  This was a different experience to my first hip replacement when the needle went in just once and I was out until I awoke in recovery. 
I was advised by the anaesthetist that I had aspirated during surgery, but he had been able to ""save"" me.  The following evening I awoke feeling very queasy and summoned the nursing staff.  Several of them appeared and took me to the bathroom, where I vomited at least twice.  I was all fluid.  Then I was supported by two or three of them, back to bed, plus another, holding a papier mache bowl under my chin, and I vomited several more times -more fluids.
I am unsure whether this was a reaction to the anaesthetic or the anaesthesia, or maybe to both..
I am due to speak with the surgeon soon.  My referring GP has blanked e on this and advised that I should refer back to the surgeon.  That was about three weeks ago.
Recovery has been very difficult.  No appetite for at least three weeks and at 5 weeks post op, I am eating, but very picky.  I am weak, lethargic and depressed.  At this stage, I should be able walk reasonably long distances.  I walk around the house without sticks, but do not venture outside without them, as people would think nothing of knocking me down, one woman in particular, whom I know who assaulted me.
I am concerned about what was actually happening whilst they were obviously ""pumping"" out my lungs, and rushing me into exray, presumably with an exposed hip joint, or even a dislocated and sawn through femur.  Whether I was without oxygen to the brain, during this time, whether brain damage has occuurred, and so on.
Is this a matter for a solicitor and medical assessment?
Has anyone on the site had a similar experience?

"I joined this group when I had my THR 7 weeks ago and have found it immensely helpful. It seems we all have pretty much the same concerns and it's really nice to communicate with other people who have already been in that position or are about to go there. Before my op I found lots of helpful things and now it feels really good to be able to offer help and support to other people. I am delighted with the result of my new hip although I will admit that I'm a bit impatient now to get back to 100%. The pain has gone instantly and, if everything is straight forward, it doesn't take long to get back to moving around without sticks, walking, driving, regular daily tasks etc but I have realised that it's going to be a while before my right leg muscles have totally regained their strength. I think you have to be prepared to continue with the exercises for several months which isn't a big deal really.

"Just wanted to post an update for my fellow hippies, especially those of you who are worried about your operation.
TLDR: Op went great. 2 days post op walking with a cane. Almost no pain.
Background: 70 yr. old male. Broke hip on bicycle accident Dec. 16, 2017. Got a partial replacement. Recovery went fine, but fell on sidewalk and knocked everything loose. Hobbled around, unable to walk more than 100 yds., until Sept. 12, 2018, when I went in for revision THR. Very worried old implant wouldn't come out without osteotomy, requiring no weight bearing for 6-8 weeks before starting normal THR rehab. But lucked out -- the implant wobbling around, causing all my pain, came right out, so I was only under for 2 1/2 hrs. Ceramic pin with plastic cup. Fantastic surgical and anesthesia team, great nursing care.
So now I'm 3 days out of surgery. I'm in less pain than I've been in for 7 months. I take a 500mg Tylenol in the morning and one at night, not so much because I desperately need it, but to keep ahead of pain.
I was up walking 6 hours after the surgery, and within the next 24 hours did about 20 rounds around the ward on a walker. I probably overdid it a bit, mainly because I was so amazed to be rid of the pain deep inside my hip. I went home about 24 hours after the surgery.
Home health care came to see me yesterday to check out the house. My ever attentive wife had already taken out all the throw rugs, removed obstacles, etc., so the house was totally safe. Medicare gave me a walker, which I absolutely hated. I got rid of that on the third day, and went to my cane -- but only after the physical therapist confirmed that I was steady on my feet.
She gave me five exercises. Three of them I do on a bed. 1) bring your heels up toward your butt 15 times. Not past 90 deg. - I can't get close to that yet anyway. 2) move your ankles up and down 15 times, stretching your calf muscles. 3) flex your quads and glutes 15 times. Then, at a counter, do 15 side stretches, where you first step on your good leg and move your bad leg out to the side while keeping your hip centered. Then do 15 on the other side, letting your operated hip bear the weight while supporting yourself on the counter. Last exercise - marching in place 15 times. I do these 5 exercises 3x per day.
Most important - walking. The PT emphasized that form was very important. Since I had been limping with a cane, and in extreme pain for 7 months, my walking form was abysmal. The three main problems were that I was ""posting"" with my bad leg, i.e. placing it off to the side to minimize direct pressure on the cup in the pelvis. Secondly, my bad hip step was much shorter than my good step. Third, my feet were too far apart. So I take three 20 minute walks a day, concentrating on those 3 things. It's harder to do, but I think it will be well worth it in the end.
The bummer is that the PT has put me on ""house arrest"" for the next two weeks -- no going out to restaurants, no overdoing it. Oh well, I probably needed that anyway.
Medications: They gave me a 3 day regimen of steroids - 3 pills the first day, 2 the second, 1 the third. I have Oxy, but I'm going to return it to the pharmacy. Stool softener, because the anesthesia tends to make you constipated. A couple more pills for inflammation. Tylenol 500mg, which is the only thing I'm taking for pain, 1 in the morning, and 1 at night.
If you're thinking about not having this surgery, think again. I know it's scary, and I was very nervous prior to the operation. But I'm so thankful I had it. I'm looking forward to resuming my active life. Yes, I'm giving up road biking, but I will ge an indoor cycling machine, and I have my weight set ready to go.
The last thing I'll say is this. I think it makes a big difference at my age to be in shape. I got out of shape after I broke my hip in December, but I was in really good shape, riding around 125 miles a week, before that. Once you pass 60 yrs. old, your body isn't so forgiving. So, if you have been living a sedentary life because of your pre-op pain, let this operation give you a new lease on life.
 And thanks to all the hippies here who gave me advice and encouragement before my operation!

"Hi, i,m a 52 y/o male that has been living with a left hip that has been fused, (arthrodesis) for 32 years now after a motorbike accident. I have no pain, quite a noticable limp, with slight lower back stiffness now. I went to see a doctor about a total hip replacement. My operation is booked in for 16th of november this year,(2018)
My problem now is that i,m totally confused an i can,t even think straight enough to make a logical decision to see if i have made the right decision.
Main concerns seem to be , how long before i can go back to work ? I drive a semi trailer an operate an excavator for a living, the doctor says 6 weeks but wow that seems awfully quick to me, i do not have any wage insurance.
Only real other concern is dislocation, do they dislocate easily , depends on the individual i,m thinking,
I really don,t know what to do, do i stay the way i am , has been 32 years an i know all my limitations with very little pain. Or do i go into the unknown at this stage of my life which not only affects myself but my wife an kids as well.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advanced , rgds ian

"Hi all! Had my hip replaced last year, aged 51, mainly due to car accident 15 years ago which included impact to left side of body, leading to severe degenerative arthritis. Have always exercised, mainly football and, running, so although I've knocked the footy on the head, wanted to try to continue with the running...nothing too far, just a couple of miles,  2 or 3 of times a week. Started off ok, but last couple of weeks have not been able to get too far before I get like a pain that starts in my bum and shoots down into my left thigh, goes no further than just above my knee but prevents me from running any further. I can continue walking but if I try running again can only get a few yards before it comes back again. No repurcussions after I've finished my run, its only while i'm running. Vey frustrating and wonder if anyone has had anything similar or could advise what problem might be. TIA

It's just muscles etc. healing and regaining their strength. X-ray was perfect. My surgeon doesn't want to see me again. Got rid of the compression stockings which is Heaven! Feeling really good. Still got to take care for another few weeks but I can try and do more things, like reach my feet for example, listening to my body. If it feels like too much of a strain, don't do it yet. All in all this has been a very successful experience and I would urge anyone having second thoughts about it to go ahead and have the operation. It's wonderful to be pain free and feel human again.

"I am getting really confused and could with some advice. My surgery is booked in two and a half weeks and I am having huge second thoughts. 
I am 43 with children and I have already had one THP! So you would think I would be much more decisive than I am. Please tell me at what stage did you have your THP:
I can not get out of a chair properly, I struggle to get in and out of car (it is quite big) I can't really shop because I can't walk far and fear I will run out of time and my hip will lock up. I can't exercise because it hurts too much. I can get up and down the stairs much more easily if I have had a quiet day. I finding sitting or standing too long quite sore. Lying down is the worst so I am struggling to sleep well.
On the upside I can still walk, I don't limp until the early evening and if I reduce my activities down to very little it still hurts, but it is not unbearable like it can be. I am still alive and well and if I do very little I can get by. Maybe I could even live like this for quite a while.
What do I do? Shall I put off the surgery until I can no longer bear to walk at all (this is what I want to do, but don't want a disorderly operation as I need to be organised with the children) and then I will be glad to go. Or shall I just go in a few weeks and get it over with.
I acknowledge I am (very) fearful of this operation and it is clouding my judgement.

"After having my hip replacement last April, I left hospital with a piece of paper, it had six basic exercises to do three times per day. Never offered any physio just left to get on with recovery alone.
My question is to those who are a few months into recovery. When lying on my side how far can I lift my leg up, is it safe to lift fairly high also, rolling down to hopefully, eventually touch the floor, is that safe.
I rang the physio department at the hospital sadly they were no help. Every question I asked I received the same answer ""if it hurts stop"" I wanted to know what progress I could expect in the near future.
I hope someone who maybe does yoga/pilates can help.

"Two hip replacements: 
THR 1 Right Hip - Lateral Incision - performed May 207, lateral incision and very fleixble surgeon who permitted me to sleep on operated side as as comfortable, other side with a pillow between knees.
THR 2 Left Hip - Lateral Posterior with a very much larger incision - about 6""  Surgeon insists that I sleep on my back for six weeks.  I am nearly four weeks into recovery. I have experimented, briefly sleeping on both sides and found it to be doable, but very quickly reverted to the surgeon's instructions - ""sleep on your back.""  Cannot get a decent night's sleep and have to use Diazepam as a sleep aid.  Makes me groggy for the day, and I will wake up at any hour, remain awake for a couple of hours, and then have to resort to the Diazepam again, and then miss half the morning.  This is no way to live.  Appreciate tht I am recovering from major surgery, but then I compare the methods and recommendations of the two different surgeons, and this inevitably raises questions.  
Wondering if any other members have had this type of experience with so wildly differing instructions, whether they have moved over to the preferred position, in my case at almost four weeks into recovery, and felt no ill effects, such as displaced hips, altered gait, etc., etc.

This site has helped me put my mind at rest many times over the last 10 weeks and for that I am grateful.
I didn't know what to expect from having a THR but any questions I had were answered.
I feel so much better for having the operation and at 47 I am looking forward to getting back to work and being happy again.
Thank you for being my support when I needed it.

I am making good progress but I have noticed that the 2nd op is far neater and I do not have muscle wastage.  On the first op my hip muscle seems to have slipped and I have an uneveness on this side.  Looking at my previous notes, I quote 'she has some wasting of the gluteus maximus muscle as well? inferior gluteal nerve palsy'.  Can anyone enlighten me on this and have you experienced a similar outcome?

"Hi.  I had my right hip replaced for the 2nd time in 13 months, almost 4 months ago.  It was done again as I had a large leg discrepancy that couldn稚 be fixed with heel raisers.
consequently I致e had continuous backache both before and after this last surgery.  I know it takes time to heal but I知 now slightly worried that there is a point on my back, above the hip, that hurts if I touch it.  It is also now beginning to hurt more when walking. I知 becoming frustrated and a bit depressed as I really thought I壇 be almost back to normal by now.  My husband is also having to curtail plans as I simply can稚 walk too far without pain.
any suggestions would be very welcome.  I知 away from home for a month swimming, walking and generally trying to improve.  I知 otherwise a healthy but overweight 72 year old - trying to lose the weight that痴 gone on since the first surgery!
Thanks for any suggestions

"I had a THR of my right hip 5 weeks ago. I can honestly say I had no real pain after the operation, just sore where all the muscles had been cut and a bit of swelling around the knee. This wasn't a surprise and it's quite a brutal operation and all the trauma goes straight down the femur to your knee. I ditched my walking sticks at 2 weeks and could walk unaided for 1.5 miles the next week. I drove my car for the first time this morning. Only problem was getting in and out with the steering wheel/column in the way. (I'm short and small and the car is large and high.) Also did 10 minutes each of cross trainer, treadmill and exercise bike at the gyn today for the first time. I am convinced I am doing so well because I have religiously done all the exercises I was given a few times every day and am being very careful not to over bend etc.  I hope this will make those waiting for the op feel more confident. All my pain has completely gone and it's the best thing I ever did. Go for it! You will always read negative comments on a forum,such as this and I wanted to put on a really positive one. Good luck everyone!

"Hip replacement Mid August with spinal block.  Metod used was quite brutal and painful in contrast to my first hip replacement.  Two injections and pain.  I had to wait, still conscious, whilst the anaesthesia worked, and was catherterised whilst still conscious.  This again, was in complete contrast to op one, where the needle went in and I was out cold.  Anaesthetist, was very unpleasant and when I remarked on the different procedures, he asked if I wanted to feel the knife go in!
I aspirated during surgery, and the anaesthetist advised that he was able to ""save"" me.  Was unclear on the methods used, but I was on oxygen for three days and exrayed. He visited the following day, and advised that if I removed the oxygen from my nasal passages,it would be fatal.  This scared the life out of me, as I could have knocked the tubes going into my nose, whilst asleep.   Evening following surgery, I was violently sick four or five times, and I believe that I collapsed.  My stomach was distended, seen by a doctor, who prodded my stomach in three different locations, and then disappeared.
Discharged the morning of the fourth day, and very rapidly realised that I had a bad stomach.  Quite a lot of diarrhea mid week following discharge, and another bout last night.  I have put myself on a course of probiotics, but it is still early days - day three, today. 
I am feeling marginally better this morning, but still cowering in bed, although I do get up some days and take care of household chores.  My GP is not interested, and has referred me back to the surgeon, in another month or so!  
It is not impossible that I may have been starting a tummy bug upon admission, but I am not sure of this.  It feels more like an infection, and I have little or no appetite, and when I do eat, it is very light.  Energy levels are low, morale is low, and I am wondering if I will ever recover.  I look like hell.  Washed my hair over the kitchen sink a week ago, as I have been instructed not to shower for two weeks post op.  Opened the door to the en suite shower at the beginning of this week, and the tower that I use for shampoos, loofahs, etc., decided to pick that moment to collapse on top of me.  It had remained in situ for well over a year.
Am I having a rough time, or what....!  
Would very much appreciate some feedback on the anaesthesia used.  The hospital has it that it would have left my body within a matter of a couple days, I am not convinced, as I am still suffering from lower abdominal discomfort and a certain amount of bloating.  I am hooping that the introduction of the probiotics will counteract any bad bacteria that y be lurking around and making me feel unwell.
YELP!

"I have started to experience groin pain in a hip replacement that occurred two years ago.  My other hip was replaced mid August 2018.  I had a ""twinge"" this morning.  I am able to walk on the hip, but find that lifting the leg to get into be is painful and I need to support it to relive the pain.  
The surgeon who performed the second op advised that the other leg was 1 cm longer than the leg that had the first hip replacement, and could not promise to even both legs out.  
There  were complication in theater - an aspiration, followed by three days on oxygen prior to release on the fourth day  The 2nd op seems to be going well, but I am very week, spend my time mostly asleep, no appetite.  District nurse, who was  here yesterday, said that I had regained ""some colour"" in my face.  However, I am still exhausted and hollow eyed.
Is this common, and if so, will it settle down, with rest, or do I need to be exercising both hips, now?  I do not want to aggravate the first hip replacement unnecessarily.
Does this ring a bell with anyone, please?

"I have posted on the an problem that I have had during and after my second hip replacement.
I was violently ill the evening following the surgery and was told it was due to the anaesthesia.  They kept me well dosed up until release..  Since release, I have been more or less flat on my back with a gastro intestinal bug; or I think that i s what it is.  Several other patients were taken ill the same evening.
Symptoms are slight headache, some nausea, abdominal bloating, complete loss of appetite - it is exactly three weeks since the op - and fatigue.  When I was in hospital and throwing up, the nurse noted that my stomach was extremely distended.
My medical practice has referred me to the clinic where the operation took place when I go in for the six week consultation with the surgeon, and that's it.
Can anyone throw any light on these symptoms?  I am wondering if they are still a hangover from the anaesthesia, although it should have left my my body some time ago.  
I know that there was a bug doing the round during the heat wave, and I came down with it.  Symptoms are very similar, but possibly more severe.  I live in the West Country near Bath.

"New to the group. Scheduled for revision next Wed. after a partial done last December failed. Before I broke my femur, I was used to riding my bike 125 miles a week and was in very good shape. Since the original op failed, I've been hobbling around and doing regular workouts in the gym. Can't put any weight on the bad leg, but able to do the stationary bike and upper body weights.
Met with my surgeon today, and she says there's about a 75% chance they'll have to do an osteotomy go get the old implant out. If they do, then I can't put any weight on the hip for 6 to 8 weeks. I'll be wheelchair bound, and will have to have help going anywhere. Once the bone has healed, then i'm looking at another 6-8 weeks of normal THR rehab.
My question is, is there any way I can keep in any sort of shape during this time? If you had revision surgery, what did you do to keep your body from falling apart, without hurting your recovery?
I'm 70 years old, male.  Thanks for any help.

"POSTING THIS UNDER HIP REPLACEMENT AS THERE IS NO FORUM FOR GASTRO INTESTINAL DISORDERS OR INFECTIONS 
I had a hip replacement in August 2018, and am less than three weeks into recovery.  I was very sick the following day, and was told that it as a reaction to the spinal. 
I have been ill ever since.  Nausea, that appears to be phasing out,dehydration, dry mouth, light headness/headache. bloated stomach, constipation followed by occasional diarrhea, extreme fatigue and am sleeping like three was no tomorrow.  No appetite, and have started on a course of probiiotics - on the third day, and they may be helping, as I am feeling somewhat better having slept - again - from 11 am through 3 pm, after a full night;s sleep.  Still do not feel hungry, so made up some Horilcks, and that's it.  I am drinking a lot of water.
Is anyone aware of a similar bug doing the rounds in the UK, or is this still a reaction to the spinal?  I aspirated, during surgery, and was very sick the following night, and have been since then.  When admitted, I may have been coming down with a tummy bug, but this is not a certainty.
I do have a very sensitive stomach, and shaking this thing off is proving to be difficult, although some slight improvement.

"I have had two hip replacements.  First one, May 2017 with few restrictions,  Surgeon permitted me to sleep on my side after the wound had healed, with a pillow between my knees.  No compression stocking and only one anti coagulant per day.  I do not know the strength of the pill.
Operation two.  On my back for six weeks, compression stocking on for six weeks, and two anti coagulants per day - 2.5 mg per pill.
Op One, very few restrictions, Op Two as above.  Anti coagulants still have another 8 days to run, which takes me through to Saturday, September 22.

"I am 66 years old and am  having THR on my right hip on September 12th.  Have been reading about the experiences that have been posted here about THR and none of them sound very positive. I am so scared of having the surgery and wish there was another alternative but the doctors says no. Hoping he wasn't rushing me to have surgery. I am going to call the office with my concerns.  As maybe I should just cancel the surgery and live how I am now walking with a cane and not having a lot of mobility to get around.  
 I have been waiting since the beginning of July for the surgery and I am terrified of having complications and once recovered not being able to live a normal life again.I understand that recovery takes about 6-12 weeks.
Went to a joint replacement class last Thursday and am even more fearful and worried as there are so many limitations as how to move once the surgery is over and I am home from the hospital. Understand will be home 2-3 days after the surgery and have home PT for three weeks then OP PT after that.
Have no one to discuss how depressed I already am other than my husband and he tries to but just doesn't understand how I am feeling, even though he had undergone bypass surgery this past February and had recovered very well.
The depression is overwhelming me and most days I can hardly function and get out of bed and I haven't even had the surgery yet.  I have been prone to depression mist of my life.
I am going to discuss with one of our priests as he underwent THR a few years ago.
Just don't have any close friends that I can discuss with and right now due to the cost therapy is not possible.I am just so conflicted.
Will speak with the doctors office as I have so many questions from the class that I attended.
Feel like the doctors office isn't giving me the support that I need.
Just in such a dark and desolate place with all of this right now.

"Second hip replacement 10 days ago.  Aspirated whilst in theatre, following evening - 2nd day - violently ill with adverse reaction to anaesthesia  Other patients had same problem that evening.  Was moving around on the new hip very well in hospital making good progress. Discharged on 4th day.  Very constipated as expected, took usual medications and had two days of diarrhea  .No appetite whatsoever.  Mostly confined to bed until 8th day.  Most of time spent asleep, but that gradually tapered off. with just a nap or two during the day now.
This is now Day 10.  Managed to wash my hair yesterday and blow dry, , which meant being on my feet unsupported.  Noted that pain had set in yesterday afternoon, and early this morning. I had woken up at about 3:00 a.m., and took 2 x paracetmol 500 mg, and then went back to sleep.  Awoke at around 9:00 a.m.  Pain is located close around the prosthetic.  Thigh still the size of a tree trunk and have to wear compression stockings and take anti coagulants twice a day.  Stockings don't bother me that much, other than the nuisance factor.  
Given the above, my question to the Forum is, should I still be experiencing so much pain, now?  Granted, I have not been on my feet as much due to the illness in hospital and at home.  Doctors have said that is sounds as though I have picked up a tummy bug.  That does seem to be passing, but still no appetite - a mixed blessing - and have been doing some of my exercises.  Movements seem fine, except when I lift my leg at the knee as if to walk upstairs, and that is where the most of the pain is located.
Needless to say, I am worried that something is not quite right.  Can anyone shed any light on this, or is all of this part of the healing process?  
Final word, the surgeon noted that the leg that needed the 2nd op was 1 cm longer than the other, and said that he could not promise to level them out, but would try.  Could this also be part of the problem - slightly more length, so more pressure on the new hip, socket and femur?

"Hi
I am currently being prescribed Tramadol/Paracetamol for severe hip pain, I am really struggling though physically and mentally as I know it will be unlikely that I receive my full hip replacement before 6 months.
A friend who had very similar problems was prescribed Fentanyl patches and described the difference as almost life changing ! she could walk easier with much less pain, and felt she had her life back again. The pain was not totally gone but on a scale of 1 - 10  helped her get to a 2 or 3 which she found much easier to cope with.
I am currently limping badly and can only ""walk"" a couple of minutes before I have to stop and rest.  Life at the moment is not enjoyable at all.
My question - have any of you felt the Fentanyl was much better than Co-Comodol or Tramadol/Paracetamol ?
I am certainly not looking forward to the next 6 months in this constant pain !

"Hi all, 
I am looking for advice please to our wise and wonderful lovely forum, and everyone that supported me so much with my last one.
So my left hip is on its last legs, and I was originally going to have THP in May, but wanted to spend the summer with my children and not in bed.
It seemed like a good idea until the last week my hip keeps locking up, as in I just can not walk at all on it at all. Has anyone else had this? Do you know why it would do this? I was on an eight hour flight and they needed to call assistance from the aircraft as I couldn't walk from the plane or even from my seat to the door no matter how much I tried, it just locked up and would not budge and it was very very embarrassing, although everyone was so kind to me. The pain is pretty relentless around the clock now any tips on best ways to sleep? I am trying to get to October the 16th the date my surgery is booked, but I am finding it really really hard going. The pain is at times reducing me to tears, and although I know the hip replacement is no walk in the park nor is this to be honest. I also feel I have to keep explaining why I can't easily get out of a chair or walk up the stairs. It is all becoming really quite tricky. 
 I would love to hear any advice at all you have on how I can keep going a little more comfortably, I am beginning to worry I will not make it to mid Oct. Anyone been in that position? 
Thanks all!

"I am now 4 weeks to the day post total TLHR & things are going great. I was so worried after reading various posts on many different forums on the internet before my operation but wanted to post something to re-assure people reading who are due the operation.
To date (and hopefully this continues) my recovery has been excellent. After the op I was in hospital for 1 night & then after walking the corridor & stairs with crutches was discharged. The next few days at home were challenging.... you take the basic things in life for granted such as being able to get dressed! I pushed myself & my body but when things started to hurt I rested. 
After 1 week I was walking with 1 stick. I would walk 1 mile one day & then rest the next day & continued this routine for a week. I carried out the Physio exercises religiously & by the time my appointment came to see the Physio (after 2 weeks) he was amazed at my progress. He subsequently gave me some more challenging exercises which I am continuing with now before my next appointment.
After 15 days I was walking 1 mile per day without any aid. Sure the muscles felt a little sore afterwards but with plenty of rest was OK the next day. 
4 weeks post op I am now back to work & driving daily (although lucky as have an automatic car). I am still careful to stick with my restrictions until I see the surgeon week 6 but feel like I have got my life back. For 3 years I was in agony & hobbling around & feel so grateful to have my life back again!
This post is to highlight everyone痴 recovery is different. I am young (35) so believe healing will be quicker but the main things I have learnt from this process are to:
1. Stay positive after the operation & during recovery. Mindset is very powerful & in the first few days having my end goal kept me going when I struggled to get dressed & go to the toilet.
2. Stay ahead with your meds. If you have a day when you feel things are getting better continue to take your tablets for the duration of the prescription.
3. Do all your physio exercises religiously they really do help.
4. Based on the speed of your recovery set yourself daily goals. These can be as simple as walking for 5 mins in the garden with crutches. Having a goal gives you something to work towards.
5. Trust in your new hip. As long as the op has gone OK then the hip replacement is functional immediately. It will be the muscles & ligaments surrounding which will cause the pain.
My surgeon advised it will take time for the body to fully heal..... this is major surgery & I am still conscious of this BUT so far having a replacement has been one of the best things I have ever done!

"Hi all,
I need a new right hip and not sure what type of procedure to have, minimally invasive [I like the sound of the quicker recovery time], the traditional tried and tested procedure but much longer recovery time or possible resurfacing!  I am looking at initially paying privately to see a consultant but that would cost approx. ｣200 per consultant who no doubt specialises in one particular procedure, so any advice on peoples own experiences would be greatly appreciated.

"Hi all, I am 38 and have severe arthritis in both hips. I was diagnosed about 7 years ago and had hip arthroscopy surgery to smooth both femoral head and socket down to allow me to still be very active, here my surgeon described my hips to those of a 70 yr old with arthritis!. this surgery allowed me to continue my job as a PE teacher and still play semi professional football(Soccer) I managed 2 more years playing but after this just couldn't manage so reluctantly gave up. from here my mobility in my hip deteriorated over time to the extent where shoes and socks and closing the hip angle is painful and restricted. generally I have minimal pain generally but do suffer bad days where the hip aches. I walk with a noticeable limp which is always commented on and cannot sit in a car for more than 10 minutes before pain and discomfort. year on year my consultant says they will operate if I want as it is that bad in x rays but as im not in crippling pain or sleep affected I feel I should just carry on? I have 2 young children under 8 too who I love being active with. any help guidance here would be great, and as I said I dont have the pain as what arthritis generally brings so am worried?

The nurse saw me today and cleaned and dressed it but said that this type of treatment only works 50% of the time to fix the problem and the other 50% they have to do surgery and re-stitch.

I haven't had one day totally pain free, I get a lot of pain in back of both legs for which I'm having deep tissue massage (which helps for a while) and groin pain.

I do some exercises and stretches and have started going back to work for a few hours 3 times per week (mainly out of boredom).

"Hi Everyone
?I am now 10wks post op, about a month ago i took myself out for walks the weather is very nice and i needed to do more than just the phisio's exercises of which i have 9 different one's to do 4 times a day.
? I put a step app on my phone so i can keep an eye on what i am doing each day, it gave me a goal to aim for each time i went out, i started on a 2000 steps per day that was ok ,so i put it up every 4-5  days each time i made myself do more and aim to do it faster  i needed to keep focused, walking on your own is hard you have no one to talk to so i turned to nature i started to notice the different types of bee's there  size and colour and the different markings, i even managed to take pictures with my phone while i am out, before i realised i had walked so far it was so much easier having some thing else to focus on.
? I have been doing the walking for a month my weak operated leg is getting much stronger, i have walked further in the last month than i have in the last 7yrs since my first hip replacement went badly wrong.
?I have walked 187.121 steps covered 127km, and burned 6928kcal,its a great feeling of being out in the fresh air getting fitter week by week and i have joined a bee conservation group to.
?The phisio lady is very pleased with my progress i have my last session on Monday.
? So I can keep the exercise going in the winter i have purchased an exercise bike a present to myself to keep healthy.
?So every one keep up those exercises the phisio gives you keep focused and healthy.

Is that going to get better as I put weight on the joint?  I've not taken any pain meds recently so I'm guessing I will need to dope up before PT.  Any suggestions?  I want to swim but am restricted from full immersion until week 6

"My first hip replacement was entirely different to the one that I having on the 17th August.  Op 1, no TEDS, no uncomfortable block between my legs, other than a soft pillow.  By the 11th day, I was able to sleep on the operated hip.  However, this time around, I have been told that I have to wear TEDS for six weeks and sleep on my back with some sort of block to keep me from moving around and the operated hip in place, which I can understand. 
First surgery was lateral, this time it is posterior lateral.  I have been told that the surgeon is very picky and rigid about what he expects of the patient.
I understand that the Teds can cause unbelievable discomfort, if not pain.  I am unsure as to whether they come off at night, or not.  I have been asked to buy a gadget to hel with taking them on and off,  As I have arthritis in both hands, I have concerns about whether or not I will have a strong enough grip to use the gadget, anyway, and am thinking that I shall have to live with the same pair for the entire six weeks as a result. 
I don't have anyone to help me, and the local social services team, or whatever they are, are pretty rough and ready.  Sensitivity is sadly lacking, so I don't really want them in my home.  
Does anyone have any ideas as to how I can manage in this six week ordeal, please?

"I've had 2 successful TKR and one THA.  On Feb. 22nd I had the second THA, an anterior approach THA.  On that same day, when questioned about the THA by the Physical therapist, I noted that I had a lot of pain and that I couldn't easily even move the affected leg.  I noted that this was very different from the experience I had with the other THA.  While I went home to an easy recovery with the first THA, I was never able to do any PT in the hospital and it was recommended that I go to a short term rehab facility.  I experienced the same pain and inability to lift the affected leg more than an inch off the ground.  I complained to the PT staff and found that the pain sometimes reduced me to tears.  13 days after the THA, I went with great pain to have the stitches removed.  the PA took an x-ray and told me that my pain was due to a fractured femur.  I was sent back to the hospital to prepare for revision surgery.  That night the imaging staff took and x-ray of the affected hip.  the following morning I was taken to the PACU to prepare for surgery only to be taken back to my room without explanation.  Later that day i had a CT scan of the THA.  I had the surgery on the following day.  It has been almost six months since that surgery and I have progressed but still have pain and can't walk without a cane.  the orthopedist told me to stop PT about four weeks ago and has no explanation for my disability only offering platitudes such as ""everyone heals differently""   Recently I reviewed the tests including the x-rays that are posted on the hospital's patient portal.  You can imagine my chagrin to find that the x-ray take in the evening after I was sent back to the hospital because of the x-ray in the morning which showed the fracture (which I saw) that later x-ray showed NO FRACTURE...which explains why they called off the surgery the next morning and asked for a CT scan.  the surgeon assured me that the x-ray taken immediately after the first surgery did not find a fracture, but if the other x-ray taken in the same hospital 13 days later did not catch tthe fracture, is it possible that the first x-ray was incorrect and that I was sent out that that first surgery with a fractured femur?

"About 30 days ago i went to see the doctor for my ""pulled muscle"" in the groin area that did not heal. He took some xrays and notified me i have moderate hip arthritis on the right side, don't need replacement yet, and gave me a few pills.  At the time I knew absolutely nothing about arthritis so i did not register in my brain what this really meant. I did manage and think to ask him how bad it is on a scale from 1 to 10 and he said 5. So off it went.
I got home and after a day or so I started to replay that scene in my mind and then hit the web. BOOM... then it sunk in... this is serious stuff!!!  I went back to his office and got the xrays, he never showed them to me. I then continued educating myself.
I was getting more and more upset, so I then went to see another OS to have a discussion. he looked at my xrays, said i have a messed up hip, explained the issue, and we chatted about pain and it is up to the individual when to have a hip replaced.  OK. 
So for the last month I have been educating myself, cut back on all high impact exercises, take supplements, and exercise lightly and stretch. I have the pain managed I would say, as the pain is less than it was a month or so ago. I can get around during the day, sleep ok, but if i over do it i will hurt, so basically i have stopped running, jumping, walking more than .25 miles, etc. I have adjusted.
So as i continue to manage the pain, what is always in the back of my mind is when should I get the hip replaced? do i just bite the bullet and do it sooner rather than later? Do i do it before I get so bad i cause more bone damage?  I guess I am saying I just don't really know when to take the plunge!  The surgeons did not offer opinions or thoughts on what they might do. So another way to ask the question, is when did you decide to get the replacement done? What made you take the plunge?   Thanks for any input and reading this long winded story.  Take care.

"At 35 years old I had a total left hip replacement 2 days ago. Long story but I fractured my hip on holiday 5 years ago & have since suffered with severe pains due to having no cartilage & bone crunching on bone!
Anyway I had my replacement & left the hospital the next day. Today has been my first full day at home & ive managed to walk numerous times around the garden with only 1 crutch...... am I over doing things so soon? The pain only appears to be from the surgery wound & the new hip seems fine. I知 just concerned as I read some stories of people taking 4 weeks to walk with 1 stick.
My biggest fear is dislocating the new hip & when I致e tried sitting on the toilet (raised seat) it痴 been agony. Also when I stand up after being seated a while my new hip feels as if something is moving around inside? As soon as I get walking this sensation stops straight away.
Any advise from people who have made a full recovery on the does & dont痴 would be really appreciated.

"I am 8 weeks post rthr (posterior) and apart from early days pain etc my recovery has been going well. I plan to return to work in 2 weeks. However a couple of days ago my hip started to ache when I walk albeit it fairly low level which makes me wonder if maybe I have discarded my stick too soon? I am still walking with a limp but assume this will improve as the muscle gets stronger over time. The pain in my groin which I had pre op happily has not returned.

"hi hippies,
i am almost 2 weeks post op for a TLHR. It really feels like this leg is longer than the right one now. I had a TRHR in June 2017. PT says it will settle after using it and getting muscle strength back that I need to get use to it. It痴 true that it痴 been 2-3 years that I致e been limping around and maybe it痴 going to take some time to relearn how to walk normally. I don稚 remember feeling this after first surgery. Just wanted to know if any of you had this sensation and how long it took to go away.  In the event that there is a real, not just perceived, difference how do you deal with it.

"Hi, I am just in week 4 (once over 10 days I really turned a corner and was feeling much better) but now I am having awful pain right at the top of my thigh at the front when I lie down. I am only getting a few hours sleep then it wakes me up and I cannot stay in bed. I feel like I am going backwards with my recovery! I only get relief by sitting, walking doesn't hurt so why would I get pain from laying down? I've tried elevating my leg but it doesn't help.
Has anyone else experienced this? I am so tired and this is making me feel down.

"It has been a long time I致e posted.  Things have gone from bad to worse but I do have answers.  I definitely did have iliopsoas tendinitis but insidiously what had started as a mildly numb lateral thigh progressed to having sensation but being very sore and the incidiously became more numb with numbness, tingling, pain and tightness spreading to buttocks, circumference if hip, front thigh, lateral thigh, back thigh.  I still thought this was from the tendonitis until I saw Dr. Riss in Florida. Dr. Ross thought some of the paints iliopsoas tendinitis but he did not know what was the cause of the lateral thigh pain opining maybe it was scar tissue..  he sent me for an injection which was very diagnostic,  the pain related to the psoas was immediately relieved for about 1 1/2 hours just from the lidocaine but the injection did nothing for the lateral thigh pain which was actually worse than the psoas pain.  Fast forward.  MRI of hip, MRI of pelvic nerves, nerve conduction studies done in nyc with diagnoses of meralgia paesthesthsia from scar tissue which is permanent, a lot of I think general adhesions partially attributed to a circlage placed by the surgeon for a less than hairline intraoperative fracture.  In other words he didn稚 really need to set the fracture,  I have a continued effusion from the capsule 8 months post op.  the mri showed some thickening of the iliopsoas bursa.  So I think the tendinitis if not completely resolved is definitely much improved but what I知 left with is nerve damage and fibrous scaring, aka adhesions.  I致e always learned that if you remove the adhesions they will come back and could come back worse.  Has anyone out there had experience with removal if adhesions or any specific physical therapy that has helped?  By the way, I have a new surgeon and he is concerned that I might have infection.  Going for an aspiration if the effusion and am scheduled for surgery to have the curclage removed and possible revision.

"So I was given quite a blow today.  After ACL/MCL knee surgery 20 years ago, I've had hip and knee pain for about 15 years with loss of motion and flexibility but i figured I was getting older and chalked up the aches and pains, took ibuprofen and kept going  I have kept up my activity and workouts about 4 times a week.  The pain has been really intense lately and I've had injections of Eufflexxa in my knee and asked my orthopedic doctor if i could see a physical therapist to see if i can get some of my flexibility back. Never mentioned my hips because I've always thought it was just my old knee and pain in my hips.  After 10 intense myofascial therapy secession's, the therapist suggested I go back to my orthopedist for an x ray of my hips.  My visit resulted in me walking out not knowing what direction to go. 
I have spurs on both hips, osteoarthritis, and little to no cartilage.  I do have a family history of osteoarthritis with double knee and ankle replacement with one of my parents, but they were much older than my current age.  
My options given were cortisone injections by radiology to see if that may help with pain or hip replacement.  I'm 48 years old, will I be able to workout again?  Should I do both hips at the same time? or Should I try these injections first?

"Hi, 2 years since I fell and had to have a hip replacement. I am still limping badly and in pain (still on Tramadol) so went for x-rays and they confirmed that one leg (the side operated on) was longer than the other - to my surprise only half a centimetre as I thought it was much more than that. Anyway saw another Consultant who said he didn't think a shoe lift would do the trick and has recommended I have a corset. Has anyone had this problem for a limp and does the corset work re getting rid of the limp? Any advice would be great.

"I'm four or five years post bi-lateral hip replacements. The journey that was undertaken with these new hips was one fraught with much pain and lost time from work and my family life.  I've had three (3) new hips on my right side and only one on the left.  The right side from the time of first displacement and subsequent surgeries has been nothing but a nightmare-now four or five years post-surgery it appears I now have a large Hematoma lodged in my groin near the prosthesis-go figure!!  The pain is so severe that it has brought tears to my eyes on several occasions.  Walking seems impossible without the use of a cane or walker.  I just had a CT scan to confirm that there is a problem in my hip, thought it was a hernia issue.  My hip doctor who also thinks he is GOD can't seem to see me until 8/9/18, really!!  I'm in so much pain and trying to keep away from the meds to alleviate said pain, it's difficult.  Does anyone or has anyone had this occur so far post surgery?  Does anyone know what the treatment protocol is?  Just want to be fixed!!!

"As someone who is on the other side of a hip replacement I'd like to suggest some tips that will help you in your quest to find a good doctor, overcome fears about whether you should commit, pain control, hospital choice, etc. If you don't mind, at the very least, hearing my experience, I would like to share some things I have noticed throughout this journey. If you want to just get the tips, they are highlighted in red.
First off, I'm 46 years old, young by many standards for a hip replacement. If you are looking at a hip replacement due to OA, make sure it's really necessary. I had AVN stage 3 and I was putting it off for as long as I could. Once the hip head collapsed I was going to be doomed. I really had no choice. I broke it 12 years ago, had the pins removed about 7 years ago, had a core decompression done and finally replaced this last Monday. If your doctor immediately screams out replacement, just be a little wary. He/she might only see you as a number, an inanimate object that they can bank off of. This surgery in the US runs about $45k as a charge to insurance. The docs make a good living off this. My doc did 11 surgeries the day he did mine so a little math...$495K
I see a bunch of fearful posts from folks about the process. My doctor is shooting to do 1000 hips this year! Find a doctor who can do this in his/her sleep. Mine was Stefan Kreuzer in Houston. If you need reference information reach out to me. I will be more than happy to help. There is nothing for you to fear with this process unless you've chosen a crummy doctor. Tip 1: DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE. Choose a doctor not because he/she is in your hometown. Pick a doc that will give you confidence. If you live in New Orleans for instance, you don't have to have surgery there if no one makes you feel confident; this is a big surgery so pick the best person for you and don't blow this very necessary step of preparation.
I didn't have a choice of my hospital but that was arranged with the world class doctor I chose. I was operated on at Memorial Hermann Hospital/Memorial City in Houston, Texas. Some things they did with me that you should ask your hospital/doctor about pre-op...Tip 2: I had a Pre-Op blood draw/health check one month prior to the surgery and a class about how to deal with a new hip following surgery and what to expect. They spoke extensively about infection and how to prevent it. They asked who was diabetic and/or who smoked. I didn't know that the chance of infection as one of these types of people increases 400%! They suggested that if you were a smoker to start the patch that day. They won't operate on you at this hospital if you are a smoker and they are proud of their less than 1% rate of post-op infection and that's for all surgeries not just hips. Diabetics, are a whole other category because of wound healing. Wound healing is delayed in smokers as well. I have no pity on smokers, you are idiotic to keep that habit up so quit today. I quit ten years ago, it takes willpower just do it. I cannot speak to diabetics but I can speak to type 2s who are growing at an alarming rate across the world. Watch ""The Magic Pill"", maybe that will instill some incentive for you to lose drastic weight and lose the diabetes tag. I lost 22 pounds before surgery to insure I would recover quickest. I also hit the weight room even though it was painful to walk. I figured at the very least to make my upper body strong enough to help me move around with my walker.
Further about infection...my hospital sent me home with a CHG Exidine (sp?) surgical scrub that I was told to wash with the night before. It is a detailed process, was told to wear clean under clothes and climb into a bed with fresh linens. The next morning I scrubbed with the same CHG soap and put on new clothes and went to the hospital. When I was admitted they took me back to the pre-op prep area where I was asked to strip naked and wipe myself down with more wipes with the cleaner and they left the soap on me as a barrier against infection. They then put the gown on me and shaved me for surgery and then applied more antibacterial agent. Five minutes before they wheeled me into the operating room I was given IV antibiotics they said would kill anything in my body before surgery. Talk about overkill so really ask questions. Ask them if they have a protocol like what I experienced. I was operated on July 9 this last Monday. I'm non weight bearing for 6 weeks due to an earlier surgery that compromised some bone structure. This brings me to another tip.
Tip 3: most people will be partial weight bearing following surgery so confirm this if you can prior. This will make your life so much easier than mine right now. We had a gentle post op PT class the morning following surgery and many if not all walked in with a 60/40 weight split. It was super cool to see people who were limping in my pre-op class a month ago, walking with zero pain. My doc had no clue I would be non weight bearing following surgery because he couldn't see the previous surgeon's mistake. This should make your recovery so much better and you should be driving in 2 weeks so don't worry about recovery times and missing a lot of work. I'm in outside sales and will have to have a walker and crutches for the next 1.5 months. You will most likely only need a cane as you strengthen so don't worry too much about recovery.
Tip 4: Get your house prepped and in order in case you have non-weight bearing orders prior to surgery. I had to have my wife go out and buy a bunch of stuff to make me comfortable last minute like a tv tray for eating in bed, a raised toilet because I'm 6'5"", etc... Most supermarkets have a home delivery service. Use it and make your life easier. If you've never used it, look up to see if your store brand has an app. Learn it and have your coach/spouse/sig other help with food prep. Tip 5: Download a super useful app called Medisafe. It will help you plan out your meds and will alert you day or night when you need to take your pills. I have now been pain free due to this super useful tool. It's like having a nurse walk into your room to bring you your meds. Tip 6: if you can get your meds ready in the hospital before you leave do it! Chasing around your meds after you are discharged is not fun. Our hospital dropped the ball here but it was partly my fault because I was starting to feel pain once the spinal block wore off and I panicked and asked for Oxycodone. That screwed up my order so we had to pursue outside of the hospital. I ended up not needing it as I took one and it made no dent in my pain like my Tramadol did.
I also was in a pain study paid for by the hospital to get the populace off opiates. I took Tramadol every 4 hours and along with the spinal block I was just fine. Once the block wore off there was no way to not feel aside from taking Morphine. I got everything under control though in about 6 hours and have been in great shape since, even sleeping great now. The appetite never left me. Our hospital had world class food. I had salmon with veggies for dinner that evening even though I was a little nauseous. The flood of drugs they put in your body before and during surgery made me nauseous when I took an afternoon dose of Tramadol. I just laid back my head and felt better after about 20 minutes as I fought the nausea.
From the time I arrived at the hospital on Monday July 9 at 10am to when I left the next day at 4pm that was a total of 30 hours in the hospital. I loved the efficiency of the entire procedure.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate reply to this post. I have been lucid during the entire 4 days so I even remember them putting in the spinal block and when they asked me to countdown backwards. I remember the recovery area and I have a good recall of conversations with my docs. so don't hesitate to reach out. I love to help others.
I hope this was helpful to any one with fears or questions. Best to you all.

"Hello~
I'm new to this forum and seeking advice and /or information.
Almost 4 weeks ago I had a total hip replacement on my right hip. (left hip done 9 months ago) Then about 2 weeks ago I stood up slowly and carefully, as usual, and I feel a severe, sharp, stabbing pain in my thigh. It dropped me back into my seat. I couldn't put any weight on it at all. So I stayed off of it until the next morning. When I got up, it was still screaming at me. I still did my physical therapy exercises but left out the ones that caused pain. Since then, the pain has minimized just enough to allow me to get around using my walker of course, but I am still experiencing a great deal of pain. I told my physical therapist and we have modified my exercises but it isn't helping.
It feels like it's in the bone, not muscular. Although the pain does radiate into my knee. The pain is constant but when I stand up or sit down or if I put to much weight on it that's when I get the sharp, stabbing pain. I had nothing like this when I had my left side done. It's horrible!! Any ideas or experience with this kind of pain?
(My apologies for the lengthy entry.)

"Well I have my appointment at RNOH Stanmore for Monday week ..... here we go again.
For those that don't know the story, I had a THR in Oct 2015 which was put in badly, had revision to correct it but that failed, and it finally exploded a week or so ago. So right now I have all the metal parts where they should be, but no ceramic in the joint to pivot my leg on - so it's all loose and flapping around inside my leg. All that's holding me together is the muscle I have built up in the last two-and-a-half years - thank goodness my physios and I did a good job.

I can tell already that the grinding pain is gone, but am having quite a lot of wound / muscle pain and tightness. I can walk quite well on two crutches, but so far apart from inside the house have only been back to the hospital twice for dressing changes as the wound is leaking a lot of serous fluid. I can manage the prescribed physio exercises, get myself in and out of bed and wash and dress but I haven't been out for a 'walk' yet, which apparently is the main form of our recovery??.

I can get a partial replacement but there are risks. I have been researching online and they say the more operations on the same side the less mobility in the hip, I have been through a few ops in my life on the same side and the mobility on my left hip is restricted. I am only 29 and I know I will have a few more ops lined up as I get older. the pain just now is barable but not sure what to do. Any one have have advice?

"I have this and waited until it was very, very painful to see my doctor.It seems that our IT BAND goes from our hip down the outer side of the leg, it crosses over the knee and then down the shin.
Every time I stood up there was pain for awhile until I got pressure on it for a couple minutes. This happens when our glute and hip muscles are too weak and overuse puts strain on the IT band. If you start to have pain on the side of your thigh, mine was a few inches up from my knee or on the side of your knee area on the edge of your hipline, treat it right away with rest, icing and Ibuprophen or another anti-inflammatory.  My physical therapist also told me about KT tape. I like the nude colored 8 pre-cut. You can find rolls of it on Amazon. If you tend to it right away you might not get it as inflamed as mine was. I am on 3 weeks of rest and icing and anti-inflammatories as per my doctor. I have 3 days of my 3 weeks left. The pain has subsided quite a bit, but is not totally gone. Since this ended up being more painful then right after surgery, I clean to take everything real slow for awhile. Hope to get some pool time in, just treading water and light exercise. My focus has changed from getting back to normal quickly to slow and steady. No long walks until those muscles strengthen every one! I have many light exercises to do. I think all will be well if I just go slow. This set me back, so please heed if you start getting this sort of pain. Rest, icing and Ibuprophen (anti-inflammatories) right away and you might keep it from the extreme pain I got. Also put KT tape along your hipline from beside your knee area up as far as it will reach. It does help more then I could have imagined.   Stretching and clamshells in bed are good too. My hip feels fine, it is not tight or painful and moves as it should. It basically feels like my own hip but stronger, but this IT band was MOST difficult and you must get it under control as soon as possible. I read one woman struggling with it for two years. I would rather take a 3 week setback and go slow and steady from here out. Personally I did a lot of walking the preceding weekend to this. I felt fine and walked through 3 large stores shopping and went up and down my daughter's stairs twice, my first time doing stairs and I did a full set twice with no handrail, just a wall I couldn't really hold onto because it had photos on it. These were not extreme activities, I think I just did too much in 2 days time. My hip muscles simply were not strong enough to endure it and I got an inflamed IT band. I sure wish I had known about it beforehand so please fellow hippies be aware! I was about 10 or 11 weeks post op when it occurred and felt elated with my hip replacement. Had pain for about 3 days after surgery, used walker the recommended 2 weeks then went to a cane. I had quit using the cane in my home and walking next door to my neighbors and even out to dinner one night. I was still using it however most times I went out, as I needed it for curbs and steps. Honestly I should have used it longer as now I am back to using it full time. I got a complete lesson about IT Band syndrome from my doctor and physical therapist. Don't stop your aids early, it is not a race, you will have less problems and a better gait if you use them longer. I forgot to mention, buy KT tape so you have it on hand, it is inexpensive at Amazon. I like the 8"" precut type. Mine stays on even with daily showering for 4 or 5 days.
Remember Hippies this IT band thing can become chronic, catch it at the very beginning. The KT tape info came from my physical therapist. The tape may even help you from getting this. If I could do it over I would have used the KT tape at the very first sign. I would have taken a couple of days of rest at the first sign, I would have iced the sore area and I would have taken an anti-inflammatory (Ibuprophen). I'm guessing it might not have progressed if I had that info. I may have only lost a couple of days instead of 3 weeks progress and saved an awful lot of pain. I was very grateful I has not used many of my pain pills as I needed them for this! When I start back to doing things, there will be no longer walking for awhile, gentle exercises and ice after activities in that IT band area. Any soreness and I will take over the counter anti-inflammatories. I am almost to that point so will have to see how it goes. I see my doctor next Wednesday and hopefully he will advise me. I do NOT want this to become chronic. I was doing great before it. I will listen to my doctor and will go slow and steady. If I can prevent one of you dear hippies from getting this as bad as I did, this posting will be worthwhile. I had so much pain  I thought I was crippled for life. Finally I am seeing light at the end of the tunnel. I will take care of myself and go slow from here on out.
Be KIND to yourselves, as much as we want to get back to our normal activities this can make them take much longer.  
If you already are in severe pain with this, see your doctor, he can give you a corticosteroid shot mid thigh that will help your healing process and most specifically the pain.  
Good luck to each and every one of you that gets this.  I read it occurs to some degree in 2 out of every 10 hip replacements.  It happens when you think everything is fine and get back to your activities.  Again, your gluten and hip muscles needs to strengthen more and that will just take time and your simple exercises.

"Dislocation is horrible and something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. 
I dislocated 8 days after returning home from inpatient rehab.  I was walking around the house without my walker (going out of the house I used walker for safety) was getting back to doing laundry, cooking, etc. and was set to go to outpatient rehab the next day when setting on a bar height stool in my kitchen was hit by a massive muscle spasm in my hip.  Instinctively I stood up and realized I was not going to be able to stay upright and my only thought was do not land on your hip. I do know that I must have grazed the top of my head (small lump on top of head) otherwise landed in a corner on my back. The spasms continued and I realized I  couldn't shift position much less get up because the pain was excruciating. Fortunately I was not alone ( of my sons were there) and 911 was called.  The trip to the hospital was miserable. 
An x-ray revealed that my new hip had dislocated.  I was sedated and attempts were made to get it back, but it didn't work. Next day my surgeon took me back to surgery where he was able to do a closed reduction.  Have huge swelling (CT shows huge collection of blood) my doctor won't drain due to fear of infection.  I was placed on  iv antibiotics when the mass turned bright red and was hot. I was also put in an immobilizer brace to keep me from flexing my knee and only given 60 degrees of movement. I am back at inpatient rehab starting my 6 week precautions all over again.  Ugh!
Of course the question is what did I do to cause the dislocation.  My doctor told me that I will likely never figure it out and best to just get on with getting better.  I do think that I was playing a little fast and loose with the precautions--nothing flagrant, but more along the lines of subconsciously doing certain movements.  I am being very careful now, but up and walking doing PT twice a day. 
I do have still a bit of fear i will dislocate again.  It is risk that we all face and I was cocky enough to think it wouldn't happen to me because of all the improvements to the procedure. 
I am doing some heavy hoping and praying that I can avoid a knee replacement on the same leg in the future.

"In the last few weeks, two and a half years after my THR revision, I have experienced some new pains. 
Basically in both my thighs, in the mornings and the evenings, when turning over in bed, and when sneezing or coughing if standing up. Sneezing or coughing when sitting was fine.
Bicycle riding was fine too, as it is in a sitting position.
Turns out my hips are fine ... it is a bulging disc in my spine pinching nerves.  Thank goodness my fantastic surgeon at RNOH Stanmore was able to put my mind at rest, so now I have to go to my osteopath to get this sorted out.
Lesson: if you get a new pain, get it checked out before you 'think yourself' into a state worrying about what it is.
Best wishes to everyone.

"2 yr ago had a left THR. At the end of 1 year hip seemed to be fine but had an excruciating pain in the upper part of my left leg. After x-ray Doctors said everything fine, no reason for pain. After some time pain did go away but has now returned with a vengeance. I have back issues since THR which may contribute to problem but that has always been the case and nothing has changed in that respect. Am scheduled to see muscular/skelton specialist next week but am skeptical. Anyone experience similar problems?

Finally had thr in April 2018 everything was good until 3 weeks after when I started having horrible groin pain. So bad I had to use crutches. Dr. Told me it was normal, take it easy, stay on crutches. 2 months later, I'm still crutches! I have pain down my leg, in my ground and in my hip. Its like I never had the surgery. I feel defeated and depressed.I'm tired all the time, I can't do anything fun, go places with friends or family. Is this just my life now? My head goes to a dark place, I'm miserable.

"Hi everyone. I'm almost 4 weeks post op from a right THR and started physical therapy a week ago. In talking to the therapist about my pain before surgery, which I still have, I was surprised to hear that most patients have pain in the groin area instead of the upper buttocks, like me. I've had 2 spinal fusions and it was my spine doctor that mentioned the arthritis in my hip after my 2nd surgery when I still had so much pain that they couldn't answer for.
Are there any others that have the pain in their lower back/upper buttock area? Or did you have the groin pain? I'm kind of wondering if there's a difference in where the pain radiates from and if that affects healing.
Thanks!

"I had my hip revision 6 weeks ago,as most of us are put on a drug called Clexane to thin the blood it is usually for 28 days. This helps to stop blood clots.
Well if finished mine 12 days ago,most of us inject ourselves at home, any way i did this finished the course.
Now because i read the claxane leaflet noting signs of illness which can happen, some times in the way of a blood clot,i had shortness of breath i could only take a small breath breathing in and there was very bad chest pains on the right hand side, also feeling very tired,this is not me so on Monday i rang the surgery, i went in as soon as i got to the doctors they suspected a blood clot.
So straight to the hospital i went i had a CT scan an MRI scan and blood tests.
I stayed 1 night in hospital they had results it was a very bad chest infection this time.
I was very lucky i new the signs of being in trouble so thanks to my clexane leaflet had given the signs of some thing being wrong.
I have been given a course of 2 different antibiotics and rest.
Thankfully it was not a blood clot i will recover with in the next few weeks.
So PLEASE every one READ your leaflet if they put you on Clexane it saved my life IT COULD SAVE YOURS.

"Hi I am new to this forum but glad I found it. I had a revision hip acetabulum three weeks ago which all seemed to go well. I know it is early days but I am so worried about a very large haematoma I acquired. It became noticeable about two days after surgery. It just didn稚 look like normal swelling. It honestly looked like a tennis ball stuck on the side of my hip. Two weeks post op I was so distressed I went back to my surgeon who dismissed it saying it would take months to go away. 
Yesterday I really couldn稚 take it any more not only does it look horrible but I feel sharp thigh pain underneath it which feels like someone poking my thigh with a sharp needle so I called my local private hospital and managed to see a consultant. He drained it and probably a good half pint if old blood came out. My leg returned to its normal self and the pain eased.
This morning why I woke up I was scared it might come back and guess what it has started appearing again. It痴 not as big but I cannot understand why more blood has collected? My common sense would say it must still be bleeding inside. I

"Hi everyone. I had a THR in November of 17, and did great. The pain that I had been living with for over 15 years was gone. I was up walking 6 hours after surgery and the nurses couldn稚 keep me from walking as much as I was in the halls. I went home the 2nd day without incident. Physical Therapy came to my house a 3 times per week for 2 weeks. Afterwards, I decided to do 2 to 3 more weeks on an out patient basis. The first week went well. However, going into the 2nd one my PT tied a rubber band around the top of my thigh then he wrapped the other end around his waist. He would slowly back up and pull my femur bone out of socket a bit to relieve pressure so he said. After he did that a few times on 2 different occasions I developed a hematoma the size of a large orange. My ortho doc was able to extract 140cc of blood off of it. He asked me if I had done something to cause it, I told him no. But, I went on to tell him about the procedure the PT had done on me. He was furious. He said, 電on稚 tell me he did that to you...don稚 tell me that! He turned to his physician痴 assistant and told her to get down there and straighten that out immediately. I don稚 know the name of the procedure he did, but it痴 some type of joint reduction. If any of you know I would appreciate hearing from you. A few days after he removed the fluid from my hematoma I began to experience severe excruciating pain deep within the groin, buttock and top of the thigh that radiated to my knee. It continued to worsen and within a week I was forced to stop PT altogether. Now, some 8 months later I have either been in bed or on the sofa due to pain.  When I awake in the morning and attempt to stand, the pain is so sinister where words cannot accurately depict the severity of it. After I do make it up I have to use a walker in the mornings and progress to either crutches or a cane later in the day. I can稚 even shower or dress standing up. I can稚 bare weight on the leg long enough to lift the other. This has taken a major toll on me both physically and psychologically. I don稚 know how much longer I can handle this pain. Upon a routine exam my Dr. hit a tender spot on my lower back. I had an MRI and it showed that I had a protrusion of the L5 and S1 disk. I would go on to have 4 epidurals over a 5 to 6 month period. None of which helped. I told my Dr. that I just didn稚 feel as though this was a back related issue. I had no back pain or numbness or tingling in my leg. He sent me to another Dr. who did an EMG on me. That Dr. said that he was 100% certain that my pain was not a result from my L5, S1 or any other disk for that matter. He said that it was something 都tructural. He went on to say had they done an EMG on me at the beginning and not the end, I wouldn稚 have had to endure 4 unnecessary epidurals. I took his findings back to my Orthopedist and he thought that the stem on my Zimmer and Fitmore device might be slipping. But, a CT scan didn稚 support his suspicions. I went on to see a vascular surgeon and had an US to the leg, but it too was normal. No one can seem to figure out what is going on with me and what痴 causing me this pain. I saw a Neurologist yesterday and she said that it might indeed be my device/hardware that is slipping, but she also thought it might be Psoas Syndrome. They are scheduling a CT scan to the pelvis to rule it out. I would appreciate any feedback you can give me regarding the Psoas Muscle and anything you may know about possible slipping and a Zimmer and Fitmore device used in my THR. 
Thank You,

Can any one please give me advice on pre surgery ideas and post surgery expectations for recovery time, pain, hospital stay and what to generally expect.
The surgeon said I have moderate to severe arthritis on the x-rays but  usually when they go in it can be worse as it is hard to see the full extent of it on an x ray.
He said it would be a 3-4 hour surgery on average. Any advice I will take.

"I致e just had the pre op assessment for my hip replacement which is scheduled for June 20th. I had the other hip replaced 10 years ago. Unfortunately that hip dislocated-twice!- necessitating a revision after 5 months. I can remember the pain. Horrendous. Anyway, I知 asking on here if surgery has improved over the last 10 years? I believe this op will be with a spinal anaesthetic which will be great, I had a knee replaced this way 2 years ago. Plus I知 terribly sick with a GA. 
Can I ask anyone who has just had their hip done how you found it, how mobile are you now, and will I have a long scar like my other hip?  How many nights were you in hospital?  Did you have knee pain also, and has that resolved since?  My pain goes right down to my shin.  I am in a great deal of pain right now, I知 walking like an old person. I need a stick indoors and really limit my trips outside. I take Tramadol, Amitriptyline and Naproxen, and Severodol for as needed. I知 being looked after by a different surgeon, and even a different hospital. This morning I was phoned by Occupational Health re aids I may need.  So that痴 all sorted. 
By the way, I知 in the UK.

"I had my first THR in January. It went very well. I was up and doing things and walking, etc in no time. All was well until the Right hip - which we knew was in rough shape too going in - just crashed. I am now unable to even walk 2/3 blocks. Too much pain in unoperated one. Big issue of late is now the operated one, which was 'the good one', is acting up. Feels heavy and some discomfort - especially when I do any physical things such as some of the exercises and even an hours gardening. I cannot get a bead on how well it is doing because
the right one - unoperated one - is a constant bone on bone pain. Surgeon says the operated one is 'doing just fine'. It was. But now I am concerned that my lack of being able to do much physically will impact my recovery over there?
Or am I being too cautious? Consider that I was walking 2/3 km's a day, biking and even hitting golf balls at range. Now I have cut back to almost '0' of those activities until the 2nd operation which, I am told, will be in early August.

"HI all,
I'm a 27-year-old male suffering with hip issues. I don't have a diagnosis of arthritis but an x-ray of my hip has shown that the ball of the joint is greatly misshapen and enlarged on the left-hand side and that there is virtually no space between the bone.
Most of the pain I experience is from standing for too long or from resting on it in an inappropriate position. However, at rest pain isn't really an issue. The pain is located in the groin area and at the bottom of my kneecap. however, the pain is by no means unbearable, I do not take medication for the most part (other than the occasional ibuprofen when it gets bad) and I wouldn't say the pain interferes with my day to day activities.
The main issue is that I have a serious lack of mobility and range of motion in that leg. I cant squat or lunge to save my life and when I try to bring my knee up towards my torso the leg externally rotates and can only get up to about parallel with my hip. I also walk with a limp which i am quite self-conscious about. The limp is worse on some days than others but I am still able to walk without assistance. I cannot run without pain or at least discomfort. 
My doctor has told me my condition is only going to get worse, which really bothers me because I enjoy going to the gym and want to remain as active as I can (I enjoy weightlifting and cycling). My doctor has also said I am inevitably going to need a hip replacement, however, I live in Britain and have heard that the NHS will only consider hip replacements ""for those in so much pain they can't sleep"". 
I really don't want to wait for my health to deteriorate that much and till I become essentially crippled and in chronic pain before having the hip replacement. So, I have been considering starting to save money so that, providing a doctor thinks it is appropriate, I could have the procedure done privately sometime in my 30's.
I was wondering whether people think it is a good idea to have the procedure done at that sort of age and whether doing it despite a major lack of pain is a wise choice?

".  This is pretty embarrassing to discuss, but feel safe enough here to do so.

Wondering if anyone else while on heavy pain medication has been told you tend to overreact to situations. 
My surgeon's PA (who himself  had 2 THRs) was critical of my going to a rehab after surgery (this was the 2 week appointment to have staples removed) and said to me ""most people leave the hospital after ONE night (I stayed 2 nights) and go directly home."". I tried to explain that due to my home being in a rural area, husband being out of town for work, etc. PT at hospital decided I was unsafe to return home. .He interrupted with more of what I perceived to be a lecture for not going home directly after surgery--and wanted to make sure I ""understood they couldn't keep me there and I could go home at anytime."" I did stand per his request and when he started in on me (again what I perceived) I said to him"" I have anxiety issues and with you talking so rapidly at me I am finding it difficult to control them"". He left the room after he blew off my concerns about my RA flaring because I couldn't take an anti-inflammatory. 
I felt he highly disapproving of my recovery choices and that I thought I was 'special' or something.  It flustered me so that I found it difficult to ask my surgeon questions (also he brought an observer in with him and no introduction was made, nor was I asked if it was okay).  I went back to rehab in tears.  Had a pity party for myself. 
I follow up with surgeon for 6 week check up and if their protocol stays the same will see PA and then surgeon.  Since my last experience with PA was so negative I am trying to think of a way to get past our differences.  I do believe that he is trying to convey that a hip replacement is not an illness and your mental attitude is important--trouble is he perceives my mental attitude to think I am  ill--I think.

"Having pain in my thigh. I had a posterior THR january 9th of 2018. Everything was going well until the last month. I have this weird pain which is more annoying then pain. It feels like restless leg syndrome kind of pain. I went back to work 2 months ago and now I have this pain. I dont know what has caused this pain but I do not like it at all. Nothing is helping. Some people say is healing pain from the metal that they put in my femur. Some say is the soft tissue growing around the implant. I do not like this pain at all. Not happy. Please help.

"Bit of a long story .... 2.5 years ago I had bilateral hip replacement anteriorly. Two days after surgery Ortho surgeon and physio paid me a visit. Asked me to raise legs from a lying position. Left leg was a log. Right leg lifted a dream but, at the second lift I felt something slip over the new joint. I told the drs but they ignored me. Right hip has given me uphill sinse then. Groin pain and into the buttock, some limitations in movement. Left leg still reluctant to left and gets sore if I persist.  Stationary bike has become a big no-no. Dr says it痴 too soon to go back in, so 6 months ago I have bilateral knee replacements. Despite my patellas being a huge source of pain for me prior to my op, surgeon decides to re-use them, saying that is what he always does. Now the patellas are still hurting, causing a catch22 situation in that I need to strengthen my thigh muscles but the sore patellas hurt! Beyond that, the inside of the right knee is still very sore after 6+ months. I feel as if I知 walking on a nerve? This usually gets worse as the day wears on and at night I still need crutches to climb the stairs up to my bedroom. I personally think the right hip issue is leading to the right knee issue. There was some massaging of the osoas tendon after the hip op, but it had absolutely no effect. So, now I want to go back and sort the hips out so that the knee can heal. Knees still ache terribly when I get of the car?

"Bursitis 10 years post THR. After my hip replacement the pain never actually went away. I am just able to deal with it and got used to it. But about a year or more ago the pain started getting a whole  lot worse. I'm at the point that I can barely lift my left leg no more than 2 inches without chronic pain and tears in my eyes. Both my legs swell so bad that I am constantly on fluid pills trying to keep the swelling under control. My pain is so severs and excruciating that I'm up most nights in pain trying to get relief from ice packs. I was given muscle relaxers but I don't like the way they make me feel. One time i lost 2 or 3 days unaware of what was happening. ugggggh...never again.
  I went to my ortho dr and at first he recomennded revision surgery. Weeks later and days before the surgery he came back and ordered a Metallosis blood test, ultra sound to see if there was any loosening of the implants ,a MRI and about 2 or 4 more other xrays which all came back negative. He did tell me that most doctors use a screw to keep the cup in place. Mine does not have a screw,but it was cemented. Nonetheless the doctor still claims there is no movement.Months after saying yes you will need surgery to no you don't and several younger doctors fresh out of their interm my doctor now he says it's Bursitis and gives me shots every 3 months. The shots does absolutely nothins for me. I am going nuts fighting this pain. Two months ago the doctor ordered a physical therapist come to my house twice a week giving me different excerises and a deep tissue massage. It helps but only last for less than a day. After doing some research I found out that my hip was in the batch of the DePuy ASR XL implants that were recalled. However in order to be included in any lawsuit I must have certain sysmptoms such as loosening of the joints or metals in the blood stream and revision surgery. I guess pain is not a factor. Has anyone else experienced this?

Pain had generally been getting better, coping with just paracetamol, walking around slowly on crutches. Yesterday physio came out and did some soft tissue massage on my thigh above my knee which hurt so much it made me cry. Also made me bend my leg back more when in a sitting position which resulted in a horrible burning pain.  Pain subsided last night but could not sleep and this morning I was grey with discomfort, had to take stronger painkillers which then made me sleep til lunchtime, much needed. Is this normal after manipulation and a change in physio? I feel I致e jumped back a step today and am quite down after feeling is moved on from the horrible burning pain earlier on after the op.

"Hi all,
Thanks again to everyone who responded to my earlier post.  
I thought to take the liberty to update you and to ask for your thoughts. I hope I'm not being a pain by writing again so soon.
 As I have shared in an earlier post, my surgeon gave me the green light to start back with upper body workouts only (seated or standing).  This is three weeks post surgery.   So on Friday night I went back to the gym and did a lighter upper body workout. I only used machines or light free weights and 
Overnight on Friday night, my hip was in some pain, not bad, more than I had experienced before.  Saturday and overnight on Saturday and Sunday was fine.  No discomfort.  Overnight, last night however, my hip was giving me a good amount of pain...and I felt it in my shin as well.   That got me concerned.   Not sure what to do 
I went for a rehab walk this morning - 15 minutes - some stiffness in groin area, but otherwise, OK.    Walking around my apartment is also OK. No problems there
But I'm just concerned about this new hip pain and its radiating to the shin that I felt overnight.  It's frustrating never knowing what to expect...and how to deal with the unexpected.   If anyone has any feedback to share, I'd be appreciative
Thanks.

"Hi All,
i had a TRHR a year ago and am having a LTHR in July. The deterioration of the left hip was pretty excelerated. It went from moderate OA to severe bone on bone in about 5 months. Maybe because it was taking the brunt of the work while I was recuperating from last year痴 surgery. I kept telling the doctor I felt like something else was going on and since I have an autoimmune connective tissue disease I was curious what an mri would show. Hesent me for one and it came back showing the fracture plus a lot of bone marrow edemain addition to the sever OA. Since the fracture is in the femoral head it won稚 be an issue once the replacement is done but I知 just curious if anyone else has had this?? It痴 not that common and google says it usually is seen in young military recruits ( I guess from excessive and rigorous rountines of boot camp ??) and in elderly woman with osteoporosis. I知 hoping I知 not considered elderly at 60 and I don稚 have osteoporosis. Its a mystery. Im just feeling kind of down because I am so not looking forward to another surgery (the last one didn稚 work all that well. Still not pain free but that痴 another story) and just generally discouraged like I知 never going to be okay. 
Thanks for listening.

"The Rules of Sleep Club - (re-posted for the hundreth time)! INVALUABLE ADVICE
Posted about a year ago
The Rules of Sleep Club (again) for the Newbies
There are many, many posts regarding sleep (of the lack of it) post-op so I thought I would share (again), my favourite post from Kate, a fellow forum member. It is invaluable advice especially for the newbies.
SLEEP CLUB
Hi everyone, I was looking back through some old posts trying to find one about constipation if all subjects (!) & I found Kate's post about sleeping. I'm sure she won't mind as I've took the liberty of copying it again. It was such a great read & made perfect sense particularly now I'm post -op.
As I now consider myself a hip guru after two THR's wink I thought I would impart my most considerable knowledge about sleeping post op.
So as you gather in closer to the screen to read I am going to poke you in the eye and tell you the first first rule...
1) There are no rules of sleep club
In fact there are so many rules of sleep club world wide that it would be hard to confine them all but we are all victim to our country, our county and surgeons particular cruelty (I mean surgical style) when it come to how we are supposed to sleep. Anterior, posterior and lateral scars all bring their own particular delights when trying to stop doing the twist in the early hours.
So, you can arm yourself with the latest in latex support pillows, V pillows, small hand embroidered cushions that Aunty Edna gave you, mattress toppers, wedges, sleeping tablets, pain relief, whiskey cocktail or a complete hospital bed but one thing isn't going to change - your healing!
Our lives before were clock driven , getting a good night's sleep before getting up for work was imperative. Lack of sleep meant we couldn't function properly.
Now, the God of New and Shiny Hip Implants has thrown all that up in the air and we don't know where we are!
We toss and turn (very carefully) waiting for the elusive sleep that never comes or comes in annoying one hour servings. You think you have slept all night only to find that barely ten minutes has gone by since you last looked at the clock. You hobble out of bed with one eye shut, trying to fool yourself into staying asleep while you have a midnight wee and you just know that if you lie there a bit longer then YOU MUST fall asleep.
As we all know things at night are magnified to horror proportions and the sweating, the pain, the twitching, the discomfort have all become mountains we cannot climb.
So, you have read this far and you are waiting for me to give you the secret to sleeping all through the night after having part of your leg chopped off and in a position that you detest. Sorry, I don't have have those answers but what I have learned is....
This lack of sleep, is it so bad? Are you hoping to go to work in the morning? Are you leaping out of bed to go hiking, on holiday, ice sking? No.
The best cure I can find for lack of sleep is - chill out, go with it, let it happen.
Goodness knows what healing is going on inside but it doesn't confine itself to happening at night. It is imperative to rest in the first 6 weeks as it is to walk and that rest can be feet up on the sofa or a few catnaps throughout the day.
I have no problems with lack of sleep because I don't care about it.
A six weeks (today) after my 2nd THR I have learned that it is all transient. Regular sleep comes back in a position that we favour eventually and the trick is to stop worrying about it.
I sleep most of the night now, waking up between 5.30 and 6.30am. Once you find that it okay to find a sleeping place all over the house you will sleep much better as well.I was more comfortable on the sofa this time so that's where I went.
I watched all the films that no one else wanted to watch and knew that I was getting back to normal when it took me five nights to watch a film.
So, wave yourself a magic wand, stop fretting, this is temporary and I'll even go as far as to say enjoy it. For those going back to work that will come soon enough and your body regulates very quickly so in the meantime give yourself a night break, chill out - a bowl of ice cream at 3am is really rather nice!

"Hi all, 
Firstly, I would like to thank everyone who took the time to reply to my first post on this forum about a week ago. I really appreciated all the helpful and instructive feedback from so many people
I'm taking the liberty to follow up with another post in hope of gaining some answers and guidance....now that I am three weeks post op.   In advance, thanks to anyone who offers their feedback.   Very grateful.   Here are my questions:
1. my operated hip is still very swollen. The incision has healed nicely, but the swelling is still there, quite large. I sense it takes a while for this to recede.
2. I am walking with Nordic walking poles now and doing pretty decently.   I do still stiffness in the hip when I walk, again to be expected, I'm sure.
3. One thing I notice is that from a lying position (on my back), I can raise my operated leg up which I could not do before surgery. I could barely nudge the leg up an inch pre-surgery. That said, I notice that when I lifted the operated  leg/hip off the mattress, it felt heavier.   Is this normal?
4. I am still not comfortable sleeping on the side of my incision. Anyone else have that issue several weeks post op?
5. How soon after THR can I start taking stairs one foot at a time (rather than planting both feet on each stair)?
Apologies if I'm asking too many questions.   But I am grateful for this forum that gives me the chance to ask. 
stay strong y'all.

"Hi all,
Hoping that I might hear from weightlifters/bodybuilders who have had THR.  I am an avid gym goer and a personal trainer who had hip replacement three weeks ago.   One of the toughest aspects of THR is having to suspend my work outs (and my work as a personal trainer).   I saw my surgeon this week (2.5 weeks post surgery for a follow up) and he actually told me I could do upper body workouts, as long as I remain in the seated upright position.  I did a brief upper body workout last night: 
*seated machine chest press
*seated lat pull down
*seated machine shoulder press
*standing dumbbell tricep extension behind the neck
*dumbbell bicep curls
*standing forearm curls
I did it in circuit training style - 3 sets each body part, 8-10 reps each
I am wondering if there are other weightlifters/bodybuilders out there with THR and how you have managed through the recovery and any advice and suggestions you can offer me .    I also do a lot of walking (now using Nordic walking poles) and I keep my diet pretty strict in order to minimize fat gain.    
Thanks to anyone who can offer their feedback.  Much appreciated. 
sincerely,

"Hi,
I am posting this for people to be aware of developing blood clots in the lungs. We are told about pain/tenderness, in the legs, warm to the touch etc., but, signs are different.
I am 8 weeks post THR, 61 fit and healthy, do not take any medication. There appears to be a lot of people coughing at the moment (by me anyway) so when out on my daily walk late last week, I began to slow up a bit and I felt a bit chesty, thought I was catching a cold without the coughing or phlegm and still went out as normal.
I had been asleep for about an hour monday night when I was woken at 1.30am by a bad pain on my right side below the breast, took paracetamol and managed to sleep after a bit.
Went to the doctors in the morning and he said he was bothered it might be a blood clot although at 8 weeks and being active it is unusual, he sent me for an x-ray and said if the pain gets worse to go the hospital or he could send me straight away, his secretary rang me about luchtime, she said how are you, he is worried about you. To be honest the pain got a lot better during the day, went up to bed about 10.45 went to sit on the bed and then pain was really bad, tried to lie down but could not, all around the upper body, the pain was excruiating. Hubby called an ambulance which can in about 10 mins and 4 hours later I saw a doctor! now the really strange thing was the pain swopped sides!!! This was a complete mystery to everyone I saw.
It was impossible to breath in without pain, after a CT scan yesterday the doctor said yes, you have clots in the lungs and that has caused a bit of the lung to collapse, which will recover, he also said it is likely the clot started on the right side then moved to the left, they had no other explaination for the pain swichting sides. I do wonder now if that may have been why the pain was all over when I tried to sit then lie down.
Now it is 3 months of apixaban tablets and hoping all will be well and the clots disperse naturally.
Please be aware of any feeling in the chest area, however minor it seems.

"Has anyone used a thigh wrap for the muscle soreness in thigh after THR? Almost 5 months since my THR and I'm still experiencing the twinges,etc. in the thigh. I know it will take time to heal. I manage with it.
I use a gel pack periodically to ease help with the discomfort. I found a Thigh Brace Wrap with Ice Gel Pack for Hot and Cold Therapy online that has velcro and can be used more easily that trying to keep the gel pack (in its cover) on my thigh.

"Hello,
Its been 6 months since left thr.
And 16 months for the right.
I've been doing ok up until about a week ago , both my hips feel black and blue , they don't hurt to touch just tender.
I do go to the gym and i am very active so i am chalking it up to that but it came on all of a sudden .
Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this & is it something I should see my surgeon for?
No fever so i am under the assumption no infection.
Also has anyone ever had problems after a dentist visit , i premeditated before i went. Was a bit intimated on what could happen if i get a infection ,has anyone out there ever gotten sick ftom a dentist visit?
Thank you for reading my worries (lookinup)

"Hey all 
Not posted in a while but i thought before i contact the GP id ask around. so basically iv been doing good since the hip replacement in august and I have AS so im used to AS type mood issues or depression or anxiety etc and i accept im a total loon and happy being that way but this is basically what iv been going through .. 
* non acceptance of hip - i am constantly aware of it being a ""foreign body"" inside me, there are very few moments in a day or a week where i am not aware of my new hip and its causing distraction and brain space issues for more important things like being self employed or enjoying a social event. 
*too scared to exercise - i suffer with a eating disorder that iv never had help for as iv had some bad experiecnes with GPS but i basically binge and starve or cut full food groups. i am more or less in control of it now but after years of pain i expect pain with exercise so although i am exercising  i am struggling to loose weight which has a lot to do with my eating habits. but i want to exercise harder to be able tog et back on a horse sooner but i am physically scared of the prospect of hurting msyelf now 
* Anxiety in public settings or social situations where it can be busy. If I ahve to walk past anyone in a busy shopping center or a outdoor street with the prospect of being bashed or walked into I almost go into full panic attack mode. 
- 3 weeks after my hip replacement someone in their 80s at a quiet social function grabbed me shuved me hard and said ""its not like its going to fall out"" then when pushed me harder when i explained actually it hasnt healed yet.. 
* i still get a lot of pain down my leg, around where my hip pain used to be, my glute max still plays up from injury a lot, I get AS pain in my pelvis or in my ""hip"" that isnt there anymore. 
- i can lie on my hip but it can hurt, driving really hurts, and i still have a signficiant limp from my brain having learnt a gait pattern previous to the op that iv been working on daily for 7 years lol 
*I have thoughts abotu the surgery, the events through the surgery, flashbacks or dreams abotu the surgery or hospital stay almost constantly even tho i do what i can to keep my mind occupied. they are very vivid dreams or flashbacks like im going through it again. 
- I lost a lot of blood in surgery and im aware of everyone panicking as i was very aware during surgery, they replaced it with fluid  which then caused a lot of abdominal post of pain for horus until i could get rid of it which basically happened at once and resulted in a flood and i still have the flashbacks to that poor nurse dealing with me. the surgery took longer and i ended up with full feeling down my left non surgical leg and could feel or aware of everything they were doing on the op leg the last 40 mins, and felt some pain with the internal stiching. 
-my grandad got his op the next day, whilst on pain killers i was visted by the top of surgery because he had said ""its fine my grandaughter sent me videos of the noise"" which i hadnt of course, so whilst drugged out i was grilled like a  criminal lol and then had to contend with  having him two wards down from me whilst pretending not to be angry at him. 
*i have a THR but i still have the prospect of the AS destroying the other hip or the pelvis now which is a constant nagging in my brain. 
So yes if i need to ill go to the gp, but i just wondered does how i feel sound normal, has anyone else experienced anything like this or am i just a 100% fruitcake :-) 
hope everyone is having a nice day xx

"Has anybody really benefited from weight loss whilst suffering severe hip pain?
Asking for lady's not online.  I have a few friends with severe hip pain. One lady lost a lot of weight - absolutely no difference to the pain suffered. Another lady lost small amount of weight and felt a difference. Strange !  it certainly makes sense the more you weigh the harder the joints must work but even stranger that the lady who had less pain having lost a little weight, has noticed that her bad hip side - her leg at the ankle seems to be thinner, possibly due to maybe less stronger muscle - maybe not even connected !

Has anybody felt less pain and subsequently felt much better after losing weight, would be interested to know how much weight loss it took to feel less joint pain.
Thank you...

"I'm very glad to have found this forum, and thanks to all involved in creating this site. I am writing I hope of gaining some guidance/advice and clarification on post-op questions I have. Thanks in advance, to anyone who replies.
I am two weeks out of surgery, and perhaps like many here who are recently recovering, many questions and observations swirl in my mind. For brevity sake, I will condense them:
1. Two weeks out of surgery is no time at all, I appreciate that. So, I know that any stiffness, aches, swelling that come and go, is normal and appropriate. Still, I do get a bit anxious every time a new stiffness or pain arises.  Example...I am finding intermittent stiffness/discomfort in my hip when I take my walks, whereas last week (my first week post -op) I didn't feel this stiffness.  That's when I start to wonder if something went wrong. I then remind myself, after reading so many entries on the forum, that this probably is normal. Any feedback is appreciated.
2. Two weeks in, I am still using my walker. My physical therapist said I could start trying out walking with walking poles (i.e. Nordic walking poles). I have done a few brief (and very slow) walk-abouts in my apartment using the poles. I guess it's normal to feel unsure, unsteady, and frankly fearful somewhat when graduating from the security of the walker to the instability of the walking poles or cane. The big step (no pun intended) will be when I have to go outside without the walker for the first time.
3.I am curious to know if anyone uses supplements or herbs to help their recovery.
Thanks again to anyone who replies and best of luck to each of you in your recovery. Stay strong.
regards,

Just a thought and wondering if any of you fellow hippies feel the same.
I am 9 weeks post op TLHR. I have been doing the exercises religiously as instructed by my physio, however I don't think I have benefited much from doing these and in fact all it seems to do is aggregate the muscles, so last week I went on holiday and gave the physio a rest for 9 days I was away, and I have felt a big improvement and today just completed a 13 mile cycle ride including steep off road hills and it felt fine so just wondering if cycling and walking would suffice and ditching the excercices altogether.

"I've learned that what I've been calling thigh and mid thigh pain after my THR is often commonly referred to as End of Stem Pain. This is not muscle pain, it's something else entirely. All I can find researching the topic are studies about what might be causing it. I just can't find studies on actual solutions and I'm getting very depressed about this, as it's been almost 10 months since my surgery and walking is now more painful than before, the pain is just in a different location ! Since my original surgeon is in a different state from where I now live, I have been seeing another surgeon who this week said my x-rays show no loosening and suggested I try Fosamax a bisphosphonate to see if this will perhaps help the stem grow into the bone better. He says it ""helps some people"" with thigh pain.  Then after another 3 months, an MRI to see if there is any fluid between the stem and my bone. I'm really upset by this because I don't see any solutions out there at all and I feel very alone and discouraged. I'm a young at heart 65 ....at least I used to be.......and I was looking forward to a better life, not more pain and disability. I don't know ANYONE who's had to deal with this. Anyone on this forum got anything encouraging to tell me about this awful problem?

"Dont mean to repeat myself but you know when in your gut you just feel like this is not right.?
Had operation May 14. Direct anterior approach.
On May 25 thought i over did it wit the exercise, it really swelled up night. Went to ER and they called it a Seroma, fluid build up after operation, they said it should go down over time, and i had my 2 week appointment in just a few days. Here in Western Canada we have follow up at 2 weeks 6 weeks and 12
So went to follow up on the 28, I did not see Dr that day, just Nurse and PT. Nurse said this swelling is very normal after this operation THR and it should go down. Well its not, and i give you all the green light to say Rick get a life and for get it. Its just tough like i said when you feel this is not right.
So this Monday will be 3 weeks post OP, I was thinkig of waiting until the 4 week  mark and if it has not gone down to call the Nurse and let them know. I hate calling to bother them.
Otherwise progressing along well. A few times yesterday i got up started to walk and for got my cane, but did not realize until i was across the room, i think this is a good sign ? I do plan to use my cane until 6 weeks for-sure.
No redness around wound, no pain, everything seems good except for walking around with what feels like 2 tennis balls under my skin. I will send a pic again, its really hard to get a picture that will do it justice. Love to know if anyone else has gone through this kind of thing after surgery 
Cant thank you all enough for being here. 
As I recover i still hope to give back to this forum by answering a few posts.

"At exactly 8 weeks out from THR, right hip, I came down with a Staph B infection. High temp, huge warm red patch over the joint and aches in my leg. It came on in 24 hrs time. Emergency admitted me and I had surgery the next morning. The surgeon opened me up cleaned it out and replaced the ball and the socket liner.
Report was my healing was going very well inside. I was actually going to return to work in 2 weeks. I spent 4 nights in the hospital, I am on IV antibiotics for 6 weeks, to be followed by oral antibiotics for 3 months (at least). And, more time off of work.
I am here because I was absolutely devastated to learn that the chances of nailing this infection with these antibiotics is only 50/50. I am 55 in July and healthy in every other respect. Not even any allergies! It was osteoarthritis that led to surgery. If this doesnt go away I will have to go through surgery again, put a cement antibiotic-infused spacer in, clear the infection and THEN ALL new parts. I hate to think of the condition my poor leg bone will be in by then, let alone my psyche.
I am home from the hospital just a week now. I have never identified as a sickly person. I feel completely floored by this and dont know who to talk to. I'm tempted to think I'm over reacting as I know people get much worse news than this every day. But, the idea that this bacteria is living in me and may not go away is REALLY freaking me out.

"Morning everyone,
This is my first post...so a bit of background.....
I am 36 years old, with 2 small beautiful children and a loving supportive husband. I work full time in a fairly stressful job which is office based.
When I was 3 I was diagnosed with a dislocated hip, and after several failed operations to correct, I ended up having a femoral and salter osteotomy.
The pain in my hip started about 10 years ago, and has got progressivly worse. My consultant tried cortisone injections last year, but they didn't help at all....so, in 11 days time I go into the Three Shires in Northampton where Mr Crawfurd is going to reaplce my hip!
I'm a research girl, so been reading lots of posts, and watching videos online.
I'm most worried about sleeping, I'm a tummy sleeper, and never need able to sleep on my back...anyone else? How did you cope?!
I'm also really concerned about this 90 degree rule for the first 6 weeks. Every chair I've sat on in teh last couple of days has made me bend more that 90 degrees, for example in a restaurant etc...now I know I'm going to be home a lot of the time, but will need to go out for my own sanity! Any tips about seating?
Thanks everyone!

"Hi there,
I was wondering if anyone knows the protocol and wait times for getting electronic copies of GPs/ specialist notes.
For context, I am US citizen and last year I was studying in the UK for my masters, during which I sought treatment for a hip/back/nerve pain through the NHS. I was prescribed and attended a couple of physio sessions, but I was deemed non-responsive to physio.
After my course was over, I returned to the US and I received a diagnosis for a torn labrum and hip impingement. I am slated to have undergo a hip arthroscopy procedure, however my insurance provider is refusing to authorize the procedure as I need to demonstrate I underwent a course of conservative treatment, for which I have 20 days to furnish these documents.
I have sent an email to GP describing my request and am hopeful for a prompt response, however I'm not sure if this is a classic red tape scenario, or if its dependent on the specific GP.
Also if there's a better section or forum for this question, please let me know.
Thanks

"I had a TLHR on January 28, 2017 with HUGE success!  I was only 41 at the time of the surgery...I was pain free and walking without assistance within a month and a half of the surgery.  My doctor and therapist were ecstatic at how quickly I bounced back and healed.  Fast forward to January 9, 2018...I fell on my icy driveway and dislocated my THR!  It took 3 doctors and 2 facilities to be able to put it back in because my muscles were so tight (my doc told my husband that is a good thing...doesn't appear to be anymore though!?!?).
Three weeks later, I was out walking and it partially popped out, stopping me in my tracks.  Within 30 secs, it popped itself back in.  This happened on 2 other occasions while I was walking.  At my one month after dislocation appointment, my doctor took x-rays and said everything looked good.  When I told him about the partial dislocations, he told me my strides were too big, so I became conscientious about how I was walking.  It happened one more time after that while I was walking about 2 months later (3 months post dislocation).

Once out amd home to recuperate i started having trouble with what i belive is the great trochanter it catches on a muscle, nerve or tendon not sure which and when that happens my right leg gives out.

My lower back was diagnosed several years ago with bilateral Osteoarthritis & levoscoliosis. Sclerosis and right mild scoliosis was just confirmed on last xray along with OP. To make things worse i walk with a limp due to total right ankle fusion and my right hip area. Had a c5-c7 fusion in 2011. I need help what can be done for the OP & OA ? Any thoughts?

"Just had my 3rd hip surgery (partial revision) since October of '17.  The surgery seems to have gone well.  But, my Ortho noticed something in the x-ray of my left femur while he was attempting to loosen the femoral stem.  He noticed what he described as ""scalloping"" bone lose in an area just below the area of the femoral stem in my LHR.  He ordered a CT scan for the next day.  The scan report showed ""Lytic area posterior to the distal extent of the femoral component with localized cortical thinning"".  Has anyone ever dealt with/seen this before?  My Ortho seems to be very guarded now about what he says to me.  Google isn't a really big help either.  Any help from past experience or knowledge would be greatly appreciated!

"Hi again everyone 
I知 29 days post op today (second hip in 12 months)   Age 50 active (as far as possible!) lady. Work full time as a nurse 
I知 having the strangest pain ever n my scar area. It happens when I知 sitting or lying down or when I知 manouvering out of bed   The only way I can describe it is it痴 a sharp tender pain and it feels like a ripping sensation underneath the scar.  There痴 no obvious inflammation, no redness or swelling. Wound is completely and nicely healed   I致e been having this sensation for about 3 days now ....   it痴 quite strong and actually makes me shout out 
I致e nursed 33 years and I致e never had a patient complain of pain his type of pain !!!!!   
Anyone else experiencing the same? 
It didn稚 happen the first time around 
Ps. Just a big thank you to everyone using this site. It痴 invaluable and it痴 nice to know your all there going through similar days as me right now 
Much love

"So it痴 six weeks after the dynamic hip screw op and I hadn稚 taken painkillers for over two weeks when yesterday I developed an ache then a throbbing pain in my left buttock, more to the side of my leg that in the middle of my bottom cheek. Not done anything different apart from go out using one crutch instead of two. Had to take strong medication to sleep last night. While area feels sore today and I知 terrified I致e dislodged the screw or it痴 moved, I壇 been doing so well, now I知 due to start physio tomorrow at my local hospital but feel I shouldn稚 in case something is wrong. Could the hip screw have moved? It痴 a horrible type pain, sickly. Not due for consultant follow up for 10 days so can稚 discuss it with him til then. Or have I just overdone it? The only other thing I did differently was to walk a few stairs 創ormally rather than one leg up and then the other, I just wanted to see if it hurt which it didn稚. Only did about four! Don稚 want to start taking painkillers again.

"I had an anterior THR the 1st of November 2017.  I was up walking in the hallways 6 hours afterwards.  I did quiet well.  It was only painful getting in and out of bed for the most.  The next morning I noticed while in a supine position I didn稚 have the strength to raise my right leg.  Not even an inch.  The pain was just too intense.  I was reassured by the nurses and my Dr. that this was normal and only temporary.  I walked the halls alone thereafter many times a day.  In fact, I was up and about so much to the point to where I didn稚 even need the pressure stockings that help prevent a DVT, etc.  Two days later I was discharged home.  The coming two weeks, PT came to my home 3 times a week for two weeks.  I did great.  However, I began to notice a different type of pain like none other to the top of my thigh, the buttock, groin and where it wrapped around the thigh and effected the knee.  PT had to alter some of their exercises that irritated the thigh and other areas just described.  After two weeks I would go on to PT on an out patient basis for 2 to 3 weeks.  By that time I was still unable to raise that leg while lying down.  Shortly thereafter I developed a large hematoma to the top of the right thigh.  My Dr. was able to extract 140cc/mls of blood.  I vented my concern of the pain that was still effecting the top of my thigh etc.  He told me to stop going to PT for awhile.  Over the next few weeks, this new pain that made itself known shortly after surgery was worsening.  I kept going back to see the Dr. who performed it, and he would just take a quick X-ray and tell me everything looked good.  During an exam, a tender spot was noted in my lower back.  An MRI showed that I had a protrusion of my L5 and S1 disk.  They felt certain that it was this that was causing me the excruciating pain in my thigh/leg.  Over the coming few months I would go on to have 3 epidurals to the L5 and 1 to the S1.  None of which helped at all.  I was having to use a walker when I awoke in the mornings then as the day progressed, I was either using crutches or a cane to get around.  I was referred to a Neurosurgeon and he ordered an EMG.  The Dr. who performed it told me that he was 100% certain that the L5, S1 or any other disks for that matter was not the cause of this pain.  He said that it was due to something 都tructural.  I took this info back to my Orthopedic Dr. for him to review.  He said that it sounded like the Stem of my new device might be slipping in and out.  A CT scan would need to be done to confirm it.  I had one and everything appeared to be normal.  I was praying that it would yield something that needed to be corrected so I would at least have a diagnosis and a solution to resolve this problem.  Even if it meant having to go back in to have it repaired.  But now I知 back at square one.  I have an appointment the 1st of June to see a new Ortho Doc.  I have got to find out what is causing me this pain.  I知 either in bed or laying on the sofa 22/7.  The small and benign activities of daily living that we all take for granted have become major tasks for me to carry out.  I can稚 even shower standing up because I can稚 bare weight on the effected leg long enough to wash the other.  I can稚 even slip on a pair of underwear, and I have to sit on the bed to put on a pair of shorts or pants.  I知 not even able to tie my shoe because it痴 too painful to bend the leg and stretch far enough.  All if this has taken a major toll on me with a vengeance.  I知 hoping that some of you may know of additional tests that are available to asses the functioning of a hip device (Zimmer & Fitmore.)  Or, any other conditions that may be causing me the symptoms as I致e described.  I would love to hear about any similar stories like mine.

"After falling and having to have a new hip 2 years ago I am still limping and in pain. Decided to visit the Doc who sent me for x-rays - AT LAST I know what the problem is - my new hip is longer than the original one - hence strain on my back and pain in back and hip. Why the hospital did not pick this up when I complained re limp and pain I don't know?
Now I am being referred to see what can be done to make my leg the same length as the other - has anyone had this problem and what was the answer and outcome please?
Just glad that the end is in sight - can tolerate the pain with medication but the limp UGH!!!

"I'm looking to see if there are some common pain symptoms for people prior to THR.  The orthopedic surgeons I've consulted with seem to dismiss muscular/tissue issues and indicate the joint needs to be replaced first for any stability to be established.  I would like to see that common muscular pain symptoms were relieved by the surgery as well as the bone on bone pain.  My personal pain/functional symptoms are: pain in the groin [specifically where the front top of the thigh meets the torso]- this has been confirmed by the PT to be a psoas muscle tightness reacting to an unstable hip joint.  Can only take stairs one at a time.  Walking in general will create pain after very short distances, often under 100 meters.  Getting in and out of the car- pain in the groin.  Lifting knee toward chest -either standing or sitting- groin pain [again psoas].  An increasing achey feeling in both hip joints- left one is worse- will often wake me from sleep when I am trying to roll over to a mote comfortable position.  In morning after getting up it can be very difficult to bear weight on the worse leg until I get moving for a while.  Can no longer get my left sock on without a great deal of positioning while sitting and a considerable amount of pain [6-7 out of 10].
As the doctor said,"" You need a new hip"".  No beating around the bush with this guy.  Good enough.
I'd like to know that some or all or even other functional/pain symptoms are common with those of us that have OA and a THR diagnosis.  Also, if the surgery fixed or alleviated any of those symptoms and not just the bone on bone pain.
Thanks in advance.

"Hi all
Ive been lurking for a few weeks ahead of my LTHR after having perthes as a youngster. Still only 38 now but it needed to be done so I can enjoy the kids growing up without being in pain. 
Anyway, had my op last Thursday and thought I壇 help out a few other lurkers with what to expect. 
Day One. The op lasted 5 hours due to the state of my hip before had the epidural and GA. a combination I highly recommend as the extra pain relief is something that you値l need. Was a bit sick from the GA and struggled to keep the good pain killers (Oxycodone) down at first as a result. My wife and dad visited that night but I don稚 think I was much company. Had a struggle sleeping that night but always do on my back. 
Day 2- here comes the physios and pain. My torchurers had me up and out of bed at 9am with a zimmer, not a good look for a 30 something. Managed a few steps out to the ward then onto the chair and out of bed. I値l be honest. Not the most comfortable experience I致e ever had. Sat up for an hour or two whilst they gave me a pressure mattress. (Turned out not to be the best move). Then came the toilet trauma. One of the nurses came in and asked if I had had a pee. By this time I haven稚 so they promptly gave me a 30 minute deadline or I was having a tube. My reply was, pass me 2 jugs of water and a bottle and I値l see what I can do. Anyway, I managed it thankfully and avoided that trauma.  That night I think was the most horrendous night ever. My operated leg started to spasm uncontrollably which left me in screaming pain. This coincided with the nurse change over which left me without pain control for 2 hours. Not a plesent experience which had me messaging the other half for help because the staff seemed to ignore my buzzer. Like I said, not an experience I would like to repeat.
Day 3. Up and moving and 9 am with physios. Onto the zimmer again and walked half the length of the ward. All good and was feeling better, if still in a fair bit of pain. Changed my meds to paracetamol and codine with Oxycodone as a backup. As long it stayed on schedule it was fine, that was until the night shift who didn稚 seem to know what a schedule one. The spasms were still there and still bloody painful. Trying to have a conversation with visitors then suddenly grabbing the rails of the bed in pain gave everyone a shock I think. That was about every 20 minutes by this time. 
Day 4 - up and about early again for physio. Onto the crutches then back to sitting in the chair for a few hours. First day I felt kind of human and managed to eat something. By this time the spasms had calmed down a fair bit but still painful when they happened. I知 convinced it was the pressure mattress they gave me causing them as they only seemed to happen when in bed but it was too uncomfortable to sit in the chair for any extended period. The rest of the day went ok. By this time I had slept a total of 2 hours a night and was loving the chance for an afternoon nap when i wasn稚 being disturbed for blood pressure tests. 
Day 5. Woke up and was in my chair long before physio arrived at 9. Did the stairs first time, walked the full length of the ward and was given the all clear to go home woohoooo!!! Was offered a proper transport home to save the risk of getting into a car which I duly accepted. When it arrived I was shocked to say the least. They turned up with the lowest wheelchair I think they could find with nowhere to rest my leg so I had to hold it out so I didn稚 break the 90 degree rule for the whole trip through the hospital. Not what  I needed. Once I made it outside I was presented with a minibus which I had to get up the steps on my crutches. Not the easiest of challenges to take on. Once on it was like being on the mad mouse at Blackpool. No suspension and no slowing for corners. Somehow got Home in one peice. Felt so much better to be back with family. Still no appetite by this stage but nice to be back.

"I was called on Friday and asked to be at the hospital a half hour earlier because they are doing a nerve block on me.  While I had hoped for a block, more specifically a block that  would be used for a day or two after surgery, I have no idea what getting a block entails.  I was already schedule to be their 2 hours prior to surgery so getting a block sounds like a lengthy procedure? 
I am having a posterior approach--if that makes any difference.
I am really curious about what goes on from the time you are admitted until you go into surgery.  I know you change, your marked, talk to anesthesiologist and surgeon, etc.  Are you sedated to have the block?

"Hi Hippies:   I went from Palm Springs to Colorado on a two hour flight without my cane and wore my compression socks both ways.  Had RHR October.  (7 Months)  I did fine.  I was concerned about the flight, but I got up a couple times and did my foot pumps in my seat.
Actually I took my cane, but didn't need it.  The Airport walk was a long distance but I did fine.  Took some pain pills with me in case I needed them.  But my question is I had a note from my Dr. saying I had the surgery and each time they made me go through the Body Scan x ray and then padded me down.  Someone told me that the Body scan x ray was bad for your hip???? Anyone know about this?  .

I am 57 years old and a bit overweight (about 40 lbs).  I never had a weight issue until my hips gave out and I became extremely inactive. I am trying to walk more and do more stairs etc, but am afraid to do anything too radical if I am still healing deep down at the top of my thigh.  Suggestions?

"I had a ""successful"" THR in August 2017. Did plenty of physical therapy, obeyed all doctor's orders, had a very well respected surgeon. But, I have continued thigh stiffness and pain. All my follow up x-rays and CT Scan showed a hip implant that looked perfect. I was eventually after much pestering told that some people experience thigh pain due to ""a mismatch between the rigidity of the stem and one's own body"" or something like that. This stiffness isn't the kind of stiffness that goes away with warming up, with heat, or ice, or stretching. It's just there all the time. Walking never feels natural or very pleasant and my gait does not feel natural. To call it stiffness is probably misleading it's more a stiffness/pain. Not excruciating pain, just always there. I feel like I am dragging a lead weight around when it's actually lightweight titanium ! It has affected my back too and it feels as though my back doesn't quite know what to do with my new hip ! That's a subjective description, but it's the best I have.

"I am at almost 12 weeks post op.  Still cannot walk to get through the day in spite of 12 weeks of PT and lots of work at home with exercises including water exercises.  I am reasonably fit with no other factors that would impede progress in recovery.   Still have lots of swelling from the hip to the ankle and in the knee in spite of ice and elevation and wrapping. Tremendous stiffness at all times and complete inability to do stairs in a normal fashion.  I limp now also.  I did not before surgery. I am getting discouraged and frustrated with time spent at PT and the run around by the surgeons office.  The doctor just keeps saying, "" it takes time...."" I am getting tired of getting put off and just doubling down on exercise with appropriate breaks for rest and ice.  Does anyone have any ""magic"" words to be fully heard post op.  I can tell they just want me out of there.  I see people every day so much further along than I am without doing half of the work I am doing to recover. I just have a feeling that there is more to this than being a slow healer. Wrong implant size? Ainfection? Scar tissue? Muscle or Ligament Damage?   I must state I have always been a pretty compliant patient and an easy healer before this surgery.  I am out there on my own to get my life back to put this behind me but could use the advice of the community on how to get some further evaluation or assessment done.  How long am I under this doctor s care before I may seek another viewpoint on my condition/recovery?
What do you do if the original surgeon just takes one x ray, doesn't examine the hip or scar, Just offers a quick "" this is a p t issue"" when I think the PT people are mystified why I am not better,  they see me working on improving on bending swollen knees, embracing whatever work load they give me, yet they don't see the advil I take when I get home, how I must turn down invites that involve walking any length and depths of anger and sadness at not getting back to my life back and the many tossing and turning nights worrying what is going on and how to do I help myself.   A proper medical mind with an actual interest in my recovery would be helpful to help me strategize a plan.

everything went well with the op.and my recovery.
my problem now is that I had to go to gp with pain in my groin of my other
hip she has referred me back to my orthapedic surgeon as she says there
was wear on the other hip when xray was done previously but I never felt any
pain in that hip before and I was just wondering if this is normal to need the
other hip replaced once one has been done as a lot of people on here seem
to have had the other one done as well after a time.
I am a little upset as I am walking and doing things normal now and going back
to sticks and pain is not a nice thought but I could not go back to the awful
pain I suffered with my right hip and if the left has to be done well I will just have
to get it done but the thought of going through this so soon is really off putting
Has this happened to anyone else?
Thanks for all the support on this site and looks like I am going to need advice
and support again.I am still very pleased that I had the operation as it is a great
way to get our life's back even if I need it again I will hopefully recover the same

"I am now 4 months after THR and am feeling a tightness in my groin area when I bend and lift this leg. Also when I have been walking for quite a bit or standing baking or making dinner, leg gets tired. Am still using 2 sticks outside but am walking indoors without them. Walking perfectly straight.
Do you think I am doing too much and should I continue to use these 2 sticks. Have previous had 18 major abdominal operations and the THR was the 19 major operation.
Perhaps it is taking me a wee bit longer after all I have been through, to collect my energy.
Thanks to all who reply.

"Obviously,  my anxiety issues have been kicked into over-drive the closer my surgery date, May 24th, gets. My husband is required to be away from home on frequent business trips and his trips are scheduled months in advanced and its rare to have him home for 5 consecutive days.  So that means there will be periods that I am at home alone. 
My son will be coming by in the evenings after work. I have a daughter who is an RN and a WOCN (Wound care, Ostomy, Continence Nurse) who lives 3 1/2 hours away who will be here day of surgery Thursday and will leave Sunday.  She is a new mother--bonus get to see my grandbaby!  She is doing what she can considering the distance and her available time she can take off work., I live in a rural area--closest neighbor is over a mile away.
Surgeon said I would do fine and I felt good about that UNTIL learning a few things from folks here who have experienced post-op at home.  Even my nurse navigator is a bit surprised that my surgeon was okay with the plan. I sincerely hope that I can do just go home and take things easy and care for myself.  A skilled nursing facility might be an option (I have good insurance), but the nurse navigator said it was something they rarely recommended for THR patients.
Has anyone on the forum gone the skilled nursing facility route?

"Cant thank you all enough for your insight and help.
I have for-sure made progress since my last post. With a long way to go, but much more willing to get there with all of your help.
Here is my new dilemma .  Yes there was a Aqua Cell bandage put over the wound site after surgery . They are water proof and i was told i could shower from the get go.
So im gong to say i have had 3 showers this week. I am one week in, post op.
There seemd to be an opening in the side of the bandage i noticed after shower 1.
After each shower there seems to be a bit more build up of fluid inside the bandage , looks alot like moisture to me, but it dose have a red tinge to it, maybe some dry blood also.
I went to an urgent care center and sat for 3 hours for someone to see me and could not wait any longer and left. I do try and be grateful for our health care here in Canada, but it could sure use some help.
its due to be removed on May 29 and staples removed at same time. Im just not sure i should be waiting that long with out having it looked at.
I was wondering if i found one of these bandages , could i not change it myself ?
Or should i head back to another urgent care centre and see how long the wait is.
I most  certainly  don't want this infected, that i know.
I am going to try and take a pic so you can see it.
Again, cant thank you all enough, for walking this road before me

Hip flexibility has improved but everything else is tight. Hurts to sit too long but work office job so need to sit a lot at work.  Walking too much also makes me sore. Just can't seem to get comfortable. Not awful pain like before replacement but frustrating.  Is this normal and how long does it last.

" Today it has been two months since my left THR.  I am 58 years old, and significantly over weight.  Previous to the surgery i had been on a 1-1/2 year journey of weight loss.  It was slow going, but I had lost 35 lbs before the pain started and derailed my fitness program.  Now I am avoiding the scale, but figure I have regained 20 lbs.  So frustrating.  I was so proud of what I had achieved.  It took a few months to figure out what was wrong.  One day in October 2017 I had a killer workout on my rower.  the next day my left leg hurt.  I had never had an exercise injury before so I did not know what was wrong.  I though maybe I had pulled a muscle.  Resting did not help.  Ice did not help.  the first trip to the doctor did not help.  PT did not help.  In fact, PT made me hurt more.  Went back to the doctor, she sent me for x-rays and to an orthopedic surgeon.  He tells me i have 2 very bad hips.  The x-rays were incredible.  the left Hip ball was completely covered in arthritic cysts.  So, about 5 months after the start of the pain, i had a anterior left THR.  I am doing pretty well.  Went back to work after 2 weeks at home, however, the 2nd week I worked from home putting in 40 hours of computer commuting.  This really did wear me out.  In comparison to many I am doing really well.  I have been walking unassisted since the 3rd week, I drive, and do stairs.  I have been somewhat lax in doing the exercises.  I do only the early recommended ones, and only when I remember to do them.  The weather as some affect on my pain.  Last week when storms were coming through our area, the pain was a strong as the week before the surgery.  But now that I know what is going on, i think I can deal with it.  
     Pain comes and goes.  Mornings are difficult.  I am slower to get ready for work than I used to be.  At this stage, should I still be doing exercises?  if so, what do you all recommend?  
     I want to add that this is my first exposure to reading a forum.  Certainly the first time participating.  i will appreciate any feedback.  
    After reading this thread, i think i am experiencing some post-op depression.  Not interested in getting on the treadmill and walking.  Though I know that would be good for me.  Before the pain,  I loved working out on the rower.  Knowing that I will wake up to some level of pain every day is draining and depressing.  I also realize that I could be doing upper body workouts that don't affect my thigh/hip.  But no motivation for that either.  Wah, wah, wah.

"I am a 60 year old in good shape that had right posterior THR 10 weeks ago.I have pretty good mobility but am still experiencing a lot of pain and stiffness.I cannot sit for long periods of time or walk for long distances without pain.In fact I have to stand for a moment after sitting a long time and then gingerly take a few painful steps before I can get going again.Went back to surgeon and he checked/xrayed hip and all looked fine.He said the pain is due to connective tissue and muscle he had to move and cut during surgery that has to heal.He gave me a cortisone shot in the pain area which only helped for a few days.I am tired of hearing so many success stories of people in their 80's that were pain free and walking around after only a few weeks.The worst part is the pain at night and havent had a full nights sleep in weeks.Has anyone else experienced a long drawn out recovery from THR  that I am going through?

"Looking for thoughts:
I'm a 44 year old male in good shape. I had a total hip replacement  and was recovering very smoothly.  I went back to work(high school teacher) and was feeling fine. I was not overdoing it, did not try and formal exercise, and was taking my doctor's advice of ""take it easy"". I was doing a lot of walking and walking up and down stairs at work. 
Then I got a small flu. Fever, chills, achy. I was in bed/on the couch for about 2.5 days. I was tossing and turning a lot. I feel like I MAY have hurt it by overusing the muscles on the inside and outside of the hip tossing and turning. 
I woke up on Tuesday and suddenly I needed my cane again. The hip joint was very unstable and the pain radiated down the leg to the knee. It's been very painful, worse than before the surgery. It's been 5 days now and I can still barely walk or move around. 
I contacted my doc Tuesday(the first day of the pain) and he told me to wait a few days and see if it goes away. I emailed him on day 4 and I haven't heard back yet. 
Thank you.

Recovery seems to take months . At least I can still get about and take medication for the pain so why would I want to put myself through surgery for more pain and possibly more side effects than I have already?

"Hi Hippies. I had a right THR 5 weeks ago in Cyprus (where I live).  I am 69 and had by left hip done 18 years ago in 1999.  I recovered well from the first one but can no longer remember how long it took to reach various stages of recovery.  As a guide to those wondering how long full recovery takes, I do remember that I had three months off (administrative) work, so, it is not a quick process and I am very surprised to see on this forum that some people are expected to return to work after 6 or 8 weeks.
Five weeks in and now walking with one stick in the house and two sticks outside. Also night sleep getting gradually more comfortable after several nights of getting up in the middle of the night and sleeping in a chair. It gets better.
Surgery and nursing in Cyprus is brilliant but admin and after care is a nightmare.  I was told by my surgeon that I need to wear these awful compression stockings for THREE months, despite that fact that I take Warfarin daily to prevent blood clotting due to atrial fibrulation.  I have read elsewhere that it is not neccessary to wear the stockings at all or that people wore them for a month only.   
Does anybody have any advice on this or personal experience?
Thanks for any help.

"I have not posted on the forum in a while;  I was pretty much at a loss as to what to try next, and more or less decided I was just destined to be in pain forever.  My anterior-approach surgery was in January of 2017, and I have not had a pain-free day since.  About one year post-op,  after continuing with physical therapy the entire time, I got to where I would say the pain was finally less than before the surgery.
In addition to several different PTs, I have seen 3 orthopedic surgeons,  a pain management doctor, a chiropractor, and will see a neurosurgeon for my back next week.  (Most docs think it is referred pain from my back.  My back does have arthritic changes, but I have never had a moment's back pain in my life, and a nerve block of the potentially pinched nerves did nothing.) 
Now I primarily have pain in the morning when I get up and at night when I'm tired.  I still  cannot climb stairs,  get up from sitting, get in or out of a car, or turn myself over in bed without using my hands to grab the headboard.
While I still have some pain in the front of my thigh, the outer hip bursa, and sometimes in my right buttock, the worst is in my groin in front.  It is also extremely tender to the touch there.  I am thinking I have ileopsoas tendinopathy.  My understanding is that this could come from trauma or irritation of the psoas or from actual impingement on it if the acetabular component of my hip is a bit large or out of place and rubbing on the muscle/tendon.  Not a single doc has suggested this a possibility, but this is my idea based on my research.
I have lost weight, continued PT until last week, exercise in the pool every single day, and walk my dog twice a day.  Trying to maintain a good attitude and just do as much as I can without making the pain worse.    Anyone else have this problem? I know there are things that can be done if this is the case, but I will have to start over and get more imaging studies to determine what to do.
Thanks for any thoughts.
PS:  I am starting to get pain in the left hip also,  very minor so far,  though not unexpected.  Had minimal joint space left on that side when I got the first one done (arthritis on both sides).  I will NOT have anterior again;  I will also put off that surgery as long as possible since the first one was so horrible from the very beginning and up to now!

"I'm hoping someone can help me.  I'm nearly 2 months out following a left, total hip replacement and to say that I have experienced complications would be an understatement.  My operated leg is virtually completely numb from the thigh to the ankle and I am so uncomfortable with the leg feeling really tight and the electric shock sensations.  I feel like I am dragging a tree log around when I'm walking.  I am Gabapentin x3 daily 600mg, alongside my other pain relief. I'm just wanting to know if anyone else has experienced this and is there anything else that can be done? I can honestly not bare this anymore and I'm afraid of the impact this is having on my mental health.  I have no inclination to get washed, dressed or get out of bed (although I'm still forcing myself at the moment).  I dread night time coming as I can't get up and down freely because of my partner and because I don't sleep.  I also dread day time as I'm too tired to hold conversations for long and I feel like I'm going to fall over when walking as I;m so tired and my leg is so heavy, despite doing my exercises.   
?To give you some background. I'm 39 and had the replacement due to childhood hip dysplasia.  I've managed the condition and subsequent osteoarthritis for 25 years but for the past 5 years, I started having difficulties with sleep, putting on my shoes and socks, and general mobility.  Despite the above, I was still walking around 3 miles a day prior to surgery and I was holding down a full time job.  
?After the consultations with my surgeon, I was told that despite the complexity of my hip, it could still be replaced but that I would need a specialist joint that could be adapted to my pelvis. However, this would increase my quality of life and if I was to leave it any longer, this would make things more difficult.  Likewise, I was also told that my recovery should take around 3 months.  Given that I used to work directly on the wards (I've worked with my surgeon in theatres also), I gave myself 6 months as an adequate recovery time (based on what my surgeon and registrar had said to me).  This would allow me to rehab at my own pace and so that I did not feel under pressure.
?Fast forward 2 months.  I can honestly say that from the moment I stepped into the theatre room, everything has been a complete nightmare.  Poor care, lack of multidisciplinary input and so forth. As well as my surgery taking 7hours (they said I should allow for around 4), I was so severely anaemic that I was almost transferred to critical care.  Furthermore, I was left with around a 2 - 2/1 inch leg length deficit as my operated leg (which was shorter by an inch prior to the surgery) was lengthened to accommodate the new prosthetic. Prior to the surgery I was told that they would try to lengthen the leg but it was highly doubtful that this would be attainable (I thought this was to try and correct the deficit and even out my gait). So not only was a left with a leg that could only be used when wearing an external shoe raise (I cannot walk without my shoes on), I am also left with a leg that is virtually numb from thigh to ankle.  The only thing I can be grateful for is that I did not endure a foot drop.  To add insult to injury, on the day I was actually able to get out of bed and manage a few steps,  I felt as though as soon as I managed to complete a few stairs, I was being pushed out the hospital door. By the time I came home, my anxiety levels were in the ceiling and I wanted to go back into hospital as I felt something serious was going to happen to me. 
?I can honestly say, I have cried every day solid since I had the surgery.  Although I am walking with crutches and one around the house, I have done this myself as my physio is eager to see me on a monthly basis and not every two weeks. I am so off-balance and unsafe but I figure if I don't start trying to do these things myself, I'm going to end up in a wheelchair.  I have literally seen no one in the community, barring a DN to remove my clips and the physio on a couple of occasions, since being discharged.  I rarely sleep for longer than an hour or two, I struggle to get comfy in any position and I'm getting horrific pain in my coccyx when sitting, I'm still on Morphine, my leg feels horrible and the numbness/pain does not seem to be improving. I've lost so much weight that I'm concerned my medication dosages may be too high (I now have a BMI of 17) and above all else, I know that I have gone into depression.  
?I'm so sorry for the long winded message.  I am so desperate and just want my old life back.  Has anyone experienced this severity of nerve damage and if so, what did you do? As I said, I'm on gabapentin but I think I'm starting to become resistant to it now.  I really do not want to keep upping my doses as I was hoping things would start to settle.  I have been assured that my nerve was not severed during the procedure but it was stretched.  I know it can take 1mm per month to grow but given that mine was not cut, what is the likelihood of this improving?
I've not had any conduction tests as yet because I've not even seen my consultant as yet. The ward clerk on the ward that I was staying booked my 6 week follow up appointment with a knee surgeon instead of my surgeon.  My appointment was cancelled 1 hour before leaving. As you can imagine, I felt so low that I did not even bother to question why this had happened.  I'm not even sure about my hip precautions or whether the joint is ok as I've not had any xrays since the day after my surgery.
?Thank you for taking the time to read this

This recovery seems to have taken forever so I find a lot of comfort in the little things.  Last week I started sleeping 6 hours at night without waking up.

The operated side still has some swelling after I've been up and around a lot.  But the post op problems are becoming less as time goes on.
I just wanted to post a success story. Despite the problems I am still very happy with my new hip. The excruciating pain in my hip and back are gone.  The long term shorter leg problem is resolved.
I wish every replacement surgery had as good an outcome as I have had.  I feel so awful for those with shorter leg complications and nerve and muscle injuries.  You all have my sympathy.

"Hello,
I had LTHR three years ago and RTHR almost 8 months ago. Everything went well after the operations with minimum problem. Two days ago, I felt pain in my left hip, probably where the stem is.. I could walk or move but had continuous pain for two days.
I didn't fall or made a wrong movement before this pain, it came out after sitting for about an hour(( As you can guess, I was very disappointed because I didin't know what would follow this pain. Had anyone been in a similiar situation? 
What are your experiences after 3-4 years?
Thanks,

"My surgery (THR left hip) is May 24th in the afternoon. Have done all the pre-op testing, spoken with my nurse navigator and aftercare social worker.
Seems that all programs wait for the talk to the anesthesiologist is not held until the day of the surgery. I am debating whether to get the nerve block in my leg. Is this something they watch closely to make sure that there is not a lapse in pain control as the block wears off.   Have had a surgery where that happened--because a. I didn't know I had been given a block and b. it wore off and I was got behind in pain control. I do not want any medication administered to my spine--again, a bad experience with awful headaches. Would like to hear your experiences with nerve blocks.
Another concern is being off anti-inflammatory medication for a week.  Anyone have that issue and how did you cope?

"Hi my names matt I'm new to this site. Looking for any advice or information I can get towards my situation. I underwent a left total hip replacement on November 24th of 2015 at 28 years of age due to bone on bone pain from arthritis and bone spurs. My surgeon believes I tore the labrum in my hip about 10 to 14 years ago playing football. The surgery was painful but I recovered fairly quickly I was able to jog without a ton of pain after 6 weeks. Jump ahead a year and a half to April or 2017. I developed severe pain in my left hip again and went back to the hospital where they aspirated my hip to discover I had an infection a form of staff. They had to remove my hip replacement break the spike out the femur and the titanium cup out of the acetabulum. They inserted a temporary antibiotic cement spacer. I underwent 6 weeks of iv antibiotics. Then after 6 weeks they re-aspirated the hip to learn it was still infected. I underwent another 6 weeks of iv antibiotics, another 6 weeks off. The aspirated again and the infection was gone. Doctor wanted to wait another month then aspirated again to make sure we were good before he put the hip back in. That's where I'm at right now. I'm scheduled for surgery on January 17th for the last surgery hope to god. But I have many concerns. My surgeon told me not to torture myself with pt since I could not advance to far with the spacer and to not cause myself to much extra pain.  I have done some pt anyway and tried weight shifting as much as possible to prevent my leg from being completely atrophied from the past 8 months. In the meantime it has become winter here in New England and I had a fall on the ice last week. I was thankful after my fall that I did not hurt my hip bad. But two days later and my hip was very sore and I can't do the excersiozes I was able to just recently. I'm concerned About going into get a new hip when my leg is so weak. Last time I had the first the I was in pain but much stronger I was able to walk. I can only toe tap now. Is it ok to get my hip put in while I'm this weak. I'm only 30 years old do any of you think I will b able to get to walk again without a terrible limp. Iv read a lot about hgh doing wonders for surgery recovery, anyone have experience with this. I quit smoking ciggarettes and just started the paleo diet. I'm trying to make myself as healthy as possible. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I'm still not driving at the moment, I tried yesterday but now have a burning sensation and buttock pain.  I have to be totally honest and I really don't feel up to going back yet but I'm worried that I will be expected to be well enough to return by now.  I'm still getting really tired after my daily 15 minute walk.  I have low blood pressure generally and have had a few ""dips"" since my op so I'm monitoring daily.  The highest its been is 111/63 and the lowest 84/59.  Do I ask my GP to sign me off for a couple of extra weeks or should I be pushing myself to get back and ""pull myself together"".

"Amazing to continue with NO HIP PAIN after such a long time (prior to surgery) of dealing with it. The recovery process was not exactly what I expected with taking more time for the annoying area of the wound to heal. Fortunately I had an amazing surgeon who did frequent follow-ups and had me use the NPWT pump for quicker healing.
I still have thigh numbness which I ice/heat a couple of times a day to relieve it. The are occasional ""twitches"" which I think are probably the nerves letting me know they are still in recovery mode. My surgeon said all of this may last for months but as long as there's no pain I can just continue what I'm doing and it will improve.
I walk often and that helps a lot. Wondering when my full strength will return so I can do even more.
When I had surgery, we were in our Florida home with no stairs. I made sure to go places to use stairs and had no real difficulty though I was very careful. Since returning to our New York home (on Sunday), I've gone up and down stairs often with no problems at all (Yay!)
I appreciate all the advice and comments from others here on the group. Positive reinforcement helps a lot.
The best advice I have for anyone considering or already had THR is to realize that everyone recovers at their own pace. There will be ups and downs but the end result will usually be an improvement in quality of life.

This was 4.5 weeks ago.  This was a DHS , 5 screws and a plate to repair.
I was't told still young 8 weeks till could go back work, issue is, I was not given any physio, no instructions, just kicked out the door.  Consultant was extremely  happy with the work so no fracture clinic visit.
I can see that on a hip replacement suppose to sleep on your back, but nothing about a DHS.
Looking on the internet there a lot of contradictions about sleeping positions for hip replacement.
I've been laying on my front and sides, no issues, only scare possibly rubbing so wear baggy shorts and PJ bottoms to cut down friction.  But know started sleeping on back or trying seems to cause issues in leg.
I've managed to find some simple exercises to do, so that should help.

"Hello all,
I'm new to this so please bear with me ?? After a long struggle with various doctors I was finally diagnosed with arthritis in both hips about 5 years ago. Due to the wear on my joints, especially in my right hip (my left hip doesn't give me half as much trouble!) it was also discovered I had an extra section of bone growing which was causing even more pain. Long story short, I had a hip arthroscopy to remove the bone and cortisone shot a year later to mask the arthritic pain which helped for about a year.
But then, I had to go back to the surgeon because the pain was just getting too much again. I can't exercise, be in the car for any long distance, struggle with basic housework tasks and sometimes even sitting at my desk. It has been completely ruling my life. I saw a different surgeon a few months ago and he felt I was ready for a hip replacement due to the impact this problem is having on my life. But he was then overruled by the head surgeon who urged me to try another round of cortisone injections in both hips. He said the extra spur bone is growing back but the wear on the joint is fairly slow and to be honest, was extremely dismissive of the pain I'm in constantly. He did agree however when questioned by my partner, that if the injections didn't work he would then look at replacing the hip with a ceramic joint.
I have had the injections and had very minimal relief for a few weeks at most. I contacted his receptionist for another appointment as advised by the surgeon and have now been told there is nothing more he can do for me as I'm too young for a replacement and I can't see him until end of February next year for a review! He won't see me or speak to me!
I am so upset that he has gone back on what he promised me, but worse than that am now left in pain with no resolution. I am so fed up of being in constant pain and whilst I know having my hip replaced in my early 30's could cause problems later in life, I believe it would give me the relief I need now to be able to enjoy life again. I have to take naproxen and the highest strength cocodamol almost daily. I have a busy full time job that involves travelling and a partner and step child and find my condition so limiting. I'm sick of waking up everyday in pain.
I just wondered if there was anyone out there with a similar problem, particularly around my age and/or anyone who has had trouble getting the treatment they need. I can only think to head back to the doctors to ask for a second opinion or to consider a private consultation. Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated. Thank you x

It's called a Trendelenburg gait. The glute muscles on the surgical side are weak and cannot support the weight to allow me to walk balanced. I was told that with physical therapy, the muscles will gain strength & the limp will go away. It has been 4 months & I've been going to PT faithfully twice a week & also doing exercises at home, but I still have the limp.

"I will be having revision surgery in August in NYC.  I had an anterior hip replacement done in Nov. 2013.  It never felt right.  The morning after surgery I stood up & had a significant difference in leg length. I felt a bulging pressure in my hip, feeling like the implant was to big.  The surgeon assured me that it would resolve. The leg length has improved but I wear a lift.  I still have constant pressure in my hip & have experienced pain in hip, buttocks & thigh intermittently.  I cannot carry heavy items. I am allergic to nickel, it was listed on my chart & I told the doctor. He said the implant was titanium. I am having a nickel blood test done. My back on my left side bothers me.

APRIL 20, some 12 days ago.  When walking on my rollator/walker, weight bearing is difficult, thereby making me put excess weight on my wrist causing me numbness in the palm of my hand and fingers.  I can feel excess pressure on my wrist every time I step and bear weight on operated leg.  Does this mean I知 not medicating enough?  It痴 discouraging me from walking. And if I don稚 walk, I知 not going to strengthen the leg for weight bearing.  Am I being hard on myself or do I need more meds?  Taking 2 Tylenol 650 mg and 50 MG of tramadol every six hours.

"I am now 6 weeks in following a total left hip replacement.  From various information I've read, I understand that you should allow 2-3 months before you can expect to take a bath.  However, at my recent post-surgery check-up, the consultant advised me that I should avoid baths completely in the future.  This was very disappointing to hear as I suffer from both rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, and having a soak in a hot bath gives me the world of comfort.  Does anyone have any thoughts/comments on this?  If so, I would really appreciate hearing from you.  Thank you.

"Hi, I am 10 weeks post op and my physio told me at 8 weeks that I could sleep on my sides without a pillow between my legs. I was really thrilled as I have had  weeks of sleepless night, laying on my back, which in turn has given me a backache. I am still so nervous that I lay on my sides with the pillow and can't rest as I am still scared that I will roll over and dislocate  my hip. When has everybody been told that they can sleep safely on their sides pillow-less?

ive seen my surgeon for my check up last week,he seems happy with me-but i seem to spend the best part of my day sitting about,and reluctant to move because it means pain!
ive had problems with painkillers,i cant take ibuprofen regularly,nor anything codeine based,so its paracetamol,which is frankly useless.i have my last physio appointment tomorrow,maybe i should ask advice?sorry to moan,but im feeling really depressed at the moment,id be grateful if anyone could give me some advice?thankyou for reading,pam.x

"I have done many things in my life that eventually became part of my daily routine.  Probably the mos advantageous as well as disadvantageous was exercise.  When I was a runner, I tried to run marathons.  Afterward, as a cyclist, I tried to race as well as ride daily in the Rockies and later, the Pyrenees. Somewhere in there I tried power lifting.  Being the extreme person I am, I was prone to overdoing it.  Going to an extreme made me prone to sports injuries.  That, along with helping friends work on their houses part time gradually led me to spinal stenosis as well as my THR 16 weeks ago.
Unfortunately,  still a small percentage of senior adults, like myself, do much daily exercise for an extended period of time.  Where I now live in Spain, exercise is seen as a must for all ages.  When living in my home country, the exact opposite was true. 
Nobody wants to to live forever but we all want a good quality of life at all all ages.  I am firmly convinced that my rapid recovery from THR was due to my pre surgery lifestyle.  After reading many excerpts as well as dissertations on this site I am also convinced that all exercise helps post surgery.  
Starting many years ago we would joke about people who decided to make exercise a daily regimen by running, working out, or cycling.  Unfortunately, devotion takes commitment.  
Now, my advice, for what it is worth is to stay off your butts and keep moving.  Quitting exercise because you feel good doesn稚 make sense.  Do something, anything.  
Now I swim an hour a day, slowly, because I am not allowed to ski, ride my road bicycle, run, etc.  
Time me to get off my soap box

"Good evening I posted a couple of weeks ago about my fear of having to have a total left hip replacement but through the advice of this forum and you wonderful people I had the procedure three days ago .The operation was not without its complications lost a lot of blood and had to have two spinal blocks the surgeon and his team were fantastic in reassuring me everything was OK.I am sending this message out from my hospital room as time seems to have stood still.
Tomorrow got another assement from Physio and all being well should be going home.I am being told to just do the exercises I am told and also plenty of walking without being stupid.Just interested in asking all of you if their is any more advice you could give to aid my recovery and be useful to remember for when I have my right hip replaced let me finish off by saying anyone out their doubting about have a hip replacement don't have it done their was no one doubting the decision more than me and even after only three days there is pain yes but not the unbearable pain of before.Once again thank you all for the advice and encouragement pre-op.

"Hi all
I had total hip replacement 10 weeks ago. Since then I have had major knee issues where I can not bend my knee a lot, I can't even put my own shoe on. My leg looks longer my surgeon has told me my pelvis has dropped 1.5cm during and since surgery causing my leg to look longer. I can not walk unaided and have a massive waddle (limp) I did not have this before. Only now am I waiting on physio. My operated leg turns outwards when sitting as it seems to long to naturally sit in my normal position. I researched some exercises and found a lady in YouTube that said the waddle is caused by weak gluteus (bum muscles) so I've now started to do bum crunches 3 times a day they are tough after you've had your muscle sliced through. Anyway has anyone else had the same problem? And has it corrected itself?
Thanks Penny

"Eight years ago I thought I had a trapped nerve in my left buttock, but after X-Rays found I had osteophytes, bone growths, on my hip. They were restricting my hip joint movement. But very little to no pain.
For all these years my limp has got worse, but still no pain. I can still kiss my right knee, can't get within 15"" of kissing my left knee, just rotation is not there.
Physio gave me hip muscle exercises, so that I could strengthen the hip joint and compensate for the bone restrictions.
Initially I did the exercises every day and added to them, but after a couple of years I was always in a bit of (after exercise) pain, so I started exercising every second day. Much better but after two more years the gnawing pain came back, not during the exercises, but afterwards whilst walking the dogs.
So I cut back again to just twice a week, generally Monday and Friday. This week, I've noticed how much more painful it has become walking the dogs. I walk slowly and sometimes have to put a fist in my left back pocket; the pressure gives me some relief.
If I don't exercise, I'm much better. Do I now stop exercising the hip. When this happens I can dog walk almost pain free.
My surgeon, over the years, has told me they can cure the pain, but maybe not the limp, through surgery. When I'm on painkillers every day....that's the time to have the operation. Is this just the NHS saving money? The pain has definitely got worse over the 8 years, I was being X-Rayed every year and the Dr's told me it was getting worse every year. So it is all expected, but I still don't require pain killers. I have then just in case, co-codemol 30mg, but only take them if I climb a mountain or go skiing. Not taken one in the last year, but took four a day climbing Snowden, Ben Nevis and Scarfell Pike the year before. Took 8 in total for a weeks skiing, I'm allowed 8 a day maximum.

While I was having physical therapy I started hurting one day. I ended up going to the emergency room because it was at night after I had took all the hurting I could. I had a broke bone in the area of the hip replacement. Went to the surgeons office the next day they were open. I was told at the office that it could have happened during surgery. Do I have any case against the surgeon since I had the broken bone.

Has any one else used heat to help with this?
P. S for any one that has pain in the groin, and pain in knee l had this too but it's pretty much gone now, so it didn't take long to go away.

"hi everyone.im13 weeks post op from a thr,and although i think im doing pretty well,im still in quite a bit of pain-more towards the evening when im tireder,.from what ive read on here its still early days so i understand i must be patient.Im almost back at my old levels of activity,-mainly housework,shopping and three daily walks with my dogs-i take one crutch as i cant yet walk long without it,without limping,though i practise holding it off the floor on nice straight paths
      but i have quite bad muscle pain in both shoulders-i was kneeling on the floor cleaning under the sink and i had the devil of a job to get up-my arms were just too weak to push me up-legs not much better!(i made it!)
also i have quite a bad pain above the operated hip,in my lower back-its quite sharp-i asked my physio when i was still seeing him(about 4 weeks ago)and he suggested stretching exercizes to both sides a bending to the front,(dont help much) .It gets worse the more i do,whether pottering at home or out with the dogs,and sometimes it makes me squeak(or yelp!) is this normal,will it go,shall i see the doctor?my hip is also painful still,which i put down to walking further ,to get back to my old doggy haunts.
 my physio also said i wouldnt damage anything by exercising,which is why im keeping on pushing myself,but the pain in various areas is quite annoying,id be grateful for any tips-any other dog walkers on here?or walkers of any description!one last question-i know you ll say yes-but is there any need to keep doing the exercises if im walking up to around 2 and a 1/2 hours a day-as well as what i do in the house-,going upstairs a lot-i find them so boring!thanks in advance and im sorry for moaning!x

"Last week, I had a follow-up appointment with my surgeon. Was great to share good news with him about full healing of my surgical wound. (I previously posted on here about issue with part of the wound not healing well and had Negative Pressure Wound Therapy pump for a couple of weeks which made a big difference.)
I can now walk further distances. (Went to Disney 2 days in a row and managed very well. First day took my cane, but second went without it.) He also told me I can use a treadmill now. (Couldn't until wound was fully healed.)
I wanted to know about need for antibiotics prior to dentist visits. There are different opinions about the need for them. He told me that many surgeons recommend using the pills for 2 years. He wants me to use them for life. I understand the proactive approach to avoid infection. (When I had the wound issue, he had me take antibiotics periodically to avoid infection.) I have no problem taking the pills prior to dental appointment. Better to be safe. I don't take meds to often anyway.
As for what he doesn't want me to do... not much. For awhile, no jerky movements. (I avoided those kinds of rides at Disney.) Walking as much as I am comfortable with. I'm working on improving my gait and pace without any walking aid.
The thigh numbness still exists so he told me to use either ice or heat, whichever feels better. I know that will continue to take time to improve.
Best of all, next appointment in ONE YEAR.
This site has helped me a lot since my January 8 surgery. Many people share their personal experiences and are supportive to others.
I'm going to continue checking new discussions, reading others as I see notifications, and doing my best to help others.

"Hello everyone. I am 27 year old man and I received a total hip replacement around 5 years ago. I'm a fairly physical and active person but I've completely avoided anything that puts a strain on hip as I want it to last as long as possible. Recently I've wanted to try jogging. I done yoga for a couple of lessons and that made me feel really nervous when stretching my hip area. Basically, should I really be stretching my hip? I'd like to be in great physical shape and tone up properly but I'm often fearful of how much I can push it. I was going to the gym for a while as well and completely avoiding anything that put impact on my hip. This really does rule out a lot of machines in the gym. Does anyone have any advice for me?

"Hi everyone I'm new to the group. I had a full left hip replacement January 11th so I'm about 3 months post-op. I still have pain when I touch the incision but it feels deep not surface pain I also have pain radiating down my left leg. Also my legs still feel stiff weird feeling. It's not constant pal. Mostly if I push on it or lay on it wrong or sit for long periods of time. Also if I overdo it walking. at first I thought it was because I was doing more and the muscles were sore. Put a call into my doctor to see if this was normal and he said no. However he's making me wait to my appointment on May 9th and he said he would check it well then so he must not be too concerned. I don't have any fever no redness but it's just still so sore I don't know what I'm doing. Has anybody else experienced this? The people I know personally that had their hips replaced say they don't have any pain and it was a walk in the park. This is been no walk in the park for me. By the way I'm 56 years old and also have rheumatoid arthritis and severe degenerative arthritis. Any help or any advice would be greatly appreciated

Well this is the week I have been dreading due to go in on Wednesday 25th April for left hip replacement.
Been doubting whether or not this is the right decision having read some of the problems that can happen post op but having now been on crutches for the last twelve months and been unable to drive for the last 8 months and in constant pain I suppose going in for a hip replacement is the right decision.
I understand we are all different in the healing process after the op but I don't want to sound like a moaner looking for sympathy but I am absolutely petrified of the operation has anyone else felt the same way before the op and realised after it was the correct decision .

"Hello, I had my Right THR 3 weeks ago today. I am slowly recovering with exercises and gentle, regular walking. I would like to return to cycling at some  point in the future - obviously too soon at the moment. Are there any other cyclists out there who have stories of how long and at what rate they returned to the activity.

"Had my anterior surgery a year ago.  I am having pain on the side of my hip.  I am told it is muscular.  Saw my surgeon at 9 months.  just need to do more stretching.  Hasn't helped. Went to PT.  New stretches - getting worse.  I am a very active person. It's starting to interfere with my golf game.

"After my first hip replacement I came here for the most amazing support.
I have somehow limped on for several months in dire need of a second hip replacement, and I am in agony. I am 43 years old with two children and a husband that works in London. I have no family. I do have wonderful friends. 
My husband tells me that taking time off will massively impact his job and earning potential, I on the other hand know I can not possibly look after two children, run a house, look after the animals immediately after surgery. My surgery last time did not go well, and I have massive issues with the thought of even going back.
Am I being unreasonable to expect help? I can't do this on my own, and quite frankly I am totally at the end of my tether with the pain, lack of sleep and I am feeling so desperate.
Maybe I should just disappear. My body is broken. I broke my arm in december and have severe nerve pain (crps) so I don't even know if I can use crutches. 
What would you do in this position? I am trying very hard to be brave for my children but everything hurts

"I had my hip joint come out at 12 years old and pinned back together. The other hip (right) was starting to come out and god pinned together. Recovery was a year in total. I had 5 more operations through until I was 25 with the ball of my hip that slipped out being re-built twice. I致e spent years in pain and I was never over weight. I was a very active person and loved sport and i never let it beat me even after having 2 children. 
For the last 6 months the pain is so un-bearable that I can hardly walk, pain killers don稚 work, I hate taking them, I have done so much physio that it no longer works. 
When I walk  I sometimes collapse with pain and considering I致e had a lot of pain in my life, I genuinely can稚 take any more. I can稚 even walk my dog 100 yards and run with the kids. It痴 not in my nature to sit down for long. Has anyone else suffered this or can give me advice.

"2 years ago I had my right knee replaced. 8 months ago I had my left knee replaced. I started having left hip issues so almost 4 months ago I had my left hip replaced. I went through the usual pt sessions. Continuing to do exercises at home. A few months ago I started getting sharp pains in my groin. Went to my surgeon for regular check up and told him about it. He said I need to do more strengthening exercises. I have been using treadmill and bought another piece of equipment to strengthen my leg. The pain has gotten worse. Last trip to surgeon he said I need to continue strength training. Said i most likely have tendonitis in psoas. He can't give me a shot due to being too soon after surgery. Continue to work it. I am back to using my cane so much pain. A week ago I stumbled over extension cord and landed on op leg (knee and hip). I jammed it pretty hard. Now my groin pain is worse and have pain under knee cap. Can't walk without cane. Surgeon says keep working psoas but I've read I should let it rest. I see Dr again in 4 weeks. I'm totally discouraged. Couldn't snowmobile this winter. Now we are heading into golfing, fishing and drag racing (husband not me) I can't do anything. Any suggestions?

"After ending up in A&E in severe pain and unable to walk, I was told I needed a hip replacement but needed to be referred by my GP.  I saw my GP at the end of October and he referred me .  I got to see a consultant at the end of January only to be told the waiting list is a year.  I have since been told by the the waiting list co ordinator that the wait starts from the time of consultation not from time of referral.  This means I will have to wait until at least next January.  I am practically housebound now and in a lot of pain.
Is there anyone who was referred at the same time as me and are you having to wait as long.

"Was anyone else's surgeon really obessive about being fit for the operation. After Bridgets post about her weight yesterday I was thinking about my surgeon. He was obessessed with looking between the toes, checking skin for rashes, the pre op nurse told me he would not operate if I burned myself while cooking so to be careful. Swabs taken at validation. I do not generally go to doctors and this being first operation everything was a new experience. I was surprised at how finicky he was about the body being clean.

"I had my left hip replacement surgery in 2015 , all went well and have been pain free, was having problems with right hip ,, so I had decided to go ahead with total hip replacement on right hip, so on October 25th 2017 I had surgery, went home and then my leg swelled and had horrible pain 2 weeks latter, I called my surgeon and got in the next day, he drew out 2 big suringes  of pus fluid, he said oh goodness, it痴 infected!! I was so scared ,, but agreed to go to hospital that very day and the next day after being admitted he opened same incision and replaced all but the stem in the leg bone and cleans and scraped infection out, which was a Staph infection,, by the way my surgeries were done in front of leg instead of the more common incision on the side of hip,,,and after surgery I was sent home with a pic line to administer IV antibiotics for 6 weeks,, well at home my incision drained so much , I went back to doctor and turns out the antibiotics weren稚 working as good as he had hoped,, so my final option was to have a antibiotic temporary spacer in place while getting rid of infection,, and longer IV antibiotics with a oral antibiotic added and then 6-8 weeks latter , 鍍ime depending on my blood work then  I would get another permanent total hip replacement and should be back to good , but to get the second hip out and the spacer in ,, he would have to make a larger incision on back side of my hip up through my buttocks,, so that痴 what happened,, now after 3 surgeries,, I sit here with a smaller incision in front that still drains a little and a larger incision up my backside leg,, it is now mid December 2017 right before Christmas and I知 in pain and can稚 bear much weight on right leg and pretty helpless for someone who is only 48 years old and normally very active,, awaiting my 4th surgery for my last permanent hip that won稚 be done until end of January or mid February,,, I知 hopeful but also very depressed,, feeling my life is on hold and mobility isn稚 very much , and administering IV antibiotics in my arm every 8 hours, I can稚 pick up my grandkids or go Christmas shopping,,

"I am 8 weeks post-operative and was doing really well, until recently suffering from a pulled muscle/bruised rib on my non-operative side. I was told to only use one crutch two weeks after my right hip replacement. Four weeks later I started to get really sore ribs. I told my physio who looked at the crutch  and said that she thought it may be due to the crutch being too high. She then measured it against me and adjusted it to the right height.  However it is so painful walking now, that I am trying not to use it. I feel at my wits end as I was progressing pretty well and now it's really painful to practise walking. I have been icing my ribs and taking pain killers again, but I feel really upset as I feel as though I have taken two steps forward and two back. Has anybody else suffered with this?

"After 8 months I just had the proveledge of getting another spacer installed and a wash out.  I was scheduled to get the revision next week now I'm back at day 1. I came up with a yeast infection called candida. I can't think of anything I did wrong to cause this. I read that the number one cause of this is broad spectrum antibiotics killing the good bacteria in your stomach that keeps the yeast in check. Without the healthy bacteria it ha the ability to cause inflammation and enter your blood stream. In turn landing on my favorite hip joint. I wonder if it could have been prevented If my doctor had used a probiotic as well. They are shocked as I am that this happened and said they don't know why it could have been anything. Which is true as well. But I feel like this was the most likely scenario after doing some research. They probably don't want to tell me that it could have been prevented. But I just want to pass along the knowledge to anyone else who has been fighting infection on antibiotics a long time. To beware

"I'm new to this site, found only by accident but so glad I did find it! I'm going to need a left THR in the coming months (was hoping years but think that is unlikely), or whenever the pain gets to a point that I decide to have the surgery.
I'm struggling most with when to have the surgery. I'm 42 years old, never had surgery/ labor so I'm not sure I know when enough is enough. I don't want to get to a place where the pain causes tears or that quality of life is degraded completely.
I've switched my exercise to cycling and swimming mainly.... sometimes an elliptical if it feels ok. I've been limping since December, but even that fluctuates. My surgeon said the surgery timing is my call, but am unsure when is right. If you'd be willing to share some insights into what made you decide to have the surgery, I'd really appreciate it!
Thanks!

"Hi, I am 47 and have hip dysplasia in both hips. After two scopes on each side to reshape bone and repair what was left of cartilage/labrum, the left hip is doing ok for the last 3 years but will eventually need replacing. The right hip never got better so I opted for total replacement. This was a year and half ago. I had super path approach by a really good surgeon. But- I致e had restricted pain ever since. Pain down the inside of my leg from the joint, into my inner knee and down to the instep of my foot some days also. Can稚 extend my hip outward too much. Pain is intense!  Dr says all X-rays are 田linically good. Nothing is VISUALLY wrong.
Has anyone else had this same problem?  I see so many folks who have very successful replacements and immediately go back to regular lifestyle. Not me. I can稚 even go for a walk on most days and really bad days, I use my cane.  Please offer any advice or knowledge if anyone has any of what MIGHT be the problem!!  Many thanks!

"Hi everyone, I have been lurking on this group recently but wanted to see if other's could share their experience (possible solutions?) with post-surgery grief/anxiety/depression.
I am two days shy of being 5 week post anterior hip replacement.  Physically I'm doing great now apparently (though not fast enough in my head!).  I'm able to walk around the house without a cane although if I have to go out with my horses or go somewhere (dr., the store, PT) I need my cane cause my leg gets tired.  I can do stairs normally now (though very slow - everything seems very slow!).  I've been off narcotics since 2.5 weeks and am doing fine with just naproxen and some tylenol on those days when I feel a bit more sore.  I can make my own meals, do my laundry, stand up in the shower again (finally), vaccuum, all that stuff.  I have had lots of support from friends and family and even my work - I work in a nursing home and my physical therapist works there so she checks in with my manager to remind her that I'm not ready to come back to work yet so my job is totally safe. 
But, despite how wonderful that all sounds, I'm still struggling with my emotions. 
Right after surgery they gave me a med I had a very bad reaction too and I was in post-op longer than expected (4 hours) because my heart rate plummeted to 33 and my blood pressure was shooting up and shooting down.  My surgery was Friday morning but my Saturday I was doing so well physically and showed I could dress myself, get to the bathroom with the walker just fine and go up and down stairs so they discharged me.  But I was emotionally a wreck.  I was absolutely terrified of everything and cried quite a bit the first day or so. 
It started to get better, then around 2 weeks I developed cellulitis and that was terrifying too.  They put me on one antibiotic but after 24 hours on it I was much worse so the dr. switched me to one that also covered MRSA and that's when I started getting better.  So, that went away and I'm back to apparently doing physically great, but I still have this overwhelming fear of ""what is next"". 
And it's rare I can go a day without feeling so sad I have to cry.  I'm not even sure what I'm sad about, I just get this ovewhelming feeling of grief and start crying.
I have dealt with anxiety disorders and depression in the past and am on an anti-depressant, so I'm guessing this is just a reaction to the surgery.  But I was also surprised by it.  For most of my adult life once I thought I had a handle on my anxiety/depression I've been very independent and able to take care of myself and keep a positive attitude.  So, it's been surprising to me how emotionally hard this all hit me.
Have others found that to be the case too? That it feels a little like PTSD?

Hip replacement  total left, anterior approach
March 2nd. Day of surgery.  Morning surgery, general anesthesia. PT came late afternoon and walked me with a walker. I have an IV and a urine catheter. Not too much pain. 
 March 3rd post op day one
Had a great Night of sleep. in the hospital.  Pain well-controlled I've been up walking twice and making good progress. Physical Therapy will be here two times this morning also. Will be headed home today later. Anterior hip replacement is the way to go I am thinking.
March 4th post op day two 
Hello everyone I am home and walking around pretty well with my walker. Pain has been minimal so far. I am on Percocet every four hours, so it's keeping it away pretty well. No complaints 
The home healthcare nurse came today and look at my incision. The incision looks angry and ugly, but appears to be healing well. I'm looking forward to taking the dressing off because I feel like the tape is burning my skin.
The Home health physical therapist also came today for the first time. I did pretty well with the Walker, and I'm really having very little pain. I have been taking the Percocet every four hours and I think I'm going to cut down on that. I am also on Celebrex as an anti-inflammatory, and aspirin 325 mg to avoid DVT's, blood clots. I'm not used to sitting around and so my mind is kind of having a hard time dealing with it.
March 6th post op day 4 Monday 
Today I am 4 days post op from my anterior left hip replacement. My pain is minimal, although I am on every 4 hours Percocet. I am also on Celebrex, an anti inflammatory, and aspirin to prevent blood clots. I am getting around slowly, but well with my walker. I'm sleeping great, although I did take an ambien last night to keep me in a good sleep. It is a lot of Meds but I want to keep the pain and inflammation to a minimal level. The only discomfort I have been having is a pinching sensation of where my implant is down in my femur, but otherwise I am well. I have some projects I'm going to be working on today on my computer, so I hope to get those done, or at least started. Hubby went back to work so I am on my own, I really feel I'm fine and if I needed him he would be here. Having this hip replacement from the front side has made a huge difference I suspect in my care.
I am still taking the pain medications every four hours. But I don't feel loopy at all. 
Tuesday March seventh,  5 days post op. 
The nurse came for a visit today and we decided I didn't need to keep the dressing on my incision. I have a lot of bruising around the site at the incision doesn't really hurt and appears to be coming together fine. I am cutting down to the Percocet I've decided to cut down to every six hours for today. I'm trying to be good about using the walker, I think it takes a load off. And will cost me less anguish in the interim. I'm kind of depressed today I like to be up and around and doing what I want to do. I need to rest.  I am feeling depressed and  find it very hard to relax.
Wednesday, March 8 post op day six
I slept really good last night and I have decided to cut my Percocet down to every eight hours. I will see how that goes, because I want to get out and drive around a little bit. Hubby doesn't want me to do that while I have the meds onboard. I really am not having any pain, the incision looks good and I continue on the Celebrex and the aspirin. I really am feeling pretty well and feel like I could probably transfer over to a cane today or tomorrow.. The physical therapist is coming today, so we will see what he says. I washed some clothes today balance in the basket on my walker. Pretty funny. I've been doing all my exercises and feel like my strength is pretty good. 
 I had my physical therapist come over. I did fine except I got really dizzy and sweaty halfway through and had to quit. I felt like I was having chest pain. I'm feeling better now but I still like I feel like I'm having neck pain. I don't know if it's reflux or really chest pain. 
I think I better listen to my body because I am being stupid and doing way too much too fast. 
Thursday, March 9.
Last night when I went to bed I just felt exhausted and sick. 
I think I have been trying to do too much and get off of my meds too quickly. 
Although I feel good I need to take it easy and I need to let my body heal. Washing laundry within a week of major surgery probably not a good idea. I need more naps I need to heal better. I've cut down on my pain pills to only every eight hours yesterday, and I woke up around one with pain around four or five  out of ten all down  my leg. . I got up took a pain pill and I took an Ambien to get back to sleep. I need to take better care of myself.
Today I am one week postop from my total hip operation. I have learned a few things that I would like to share. First  listen to your body. Just because you  feel great and have no pain does not mean you didn't have a major surgery and that you should not take it easy. What it does mean is that the medicine, yes pain pills that you are on, are  working well. Does that mean you should cut them way back? The answer is no. That means you should enjoy feeling good enough that your body is not in pain so it can heal. You will not become an opiate addict over a space of two weeks, and although your family and friends may be fearful for you because of that, it really will not happen.
Second  just because you feel pretty good does not mean that you should be washing clothes and watering flowers outside. Even though you might feel pretty good doing it- it is taking a huge toll on yourself that you don't even realize The exhaustion that it will bring in a couple of hours. Third  when you wake up in the middle of the night having the worst pain of the whole week-  you think how stupid you must of been to think you could go without taking your pain pills. And so you then climb out of bed to take those pain pills and get back to bed to try to have a good night sleep. Not sleeping equals no healing.
I am learning the hard way how to take it easy, and it's not easy. I've been reading, napping, knitting, and watching TV which I realize I really do not enjoy. I am not sure what has happened to my attention span but it is way decreased. This has been a very good exercise for me, training myself to slow down. I appreciate all of your good wishes you have sent me and all of your calls and texts. I have learned that I need to be responsible for my own boredom and enjoy this down time.  As for my healing I am doing well, getting around but taking it a little bit slower than I was even a couple days ago.  Imagine me tearing around the house with a walker. An inspiring but not so pretty sight. Thank  you everyone for your support, I love the Internet and all the good that it brings.

Post op day 12
I've been getting around pretty well with my cane, but I need to be careful because if I start to limp then my knee hurts. 
I'm getting off of the pain meds mostly taking them at night, along with half of an Ambien. I've been taking some ibuprofen and that seems to help with the knee and making sure that I use ice also.
I am still using the walker when I'm just getting around the house because it really stops me from limping, I am doing good with PT exercises. My incision is healing really well and doesn't hurt at all anymore.
I have had five sessions of home physical therapy and still have three to go, I'm going to space them out 
March 15  postop day 13 
 I slept great last night- I am taking the Percocet and half of an Ambien to get through the night and the struggle of getting comfortable. Otherwise I am up and moving tentatively but well. I'm using the walker for longer distances and the cane for just short distances. It seems as if I overdo walking with the cane or without the cane I seem to limp  and the limp then hurts my knee. And then I start to wonder and worry about my knee. I'm still using ice a couple of times a day I feel like it's still very important part of my therapy especially after walking around a lot. During the day I have been taking ibuprofen and still the aspirin twice a day for clots. I'm not sure if I should still be on the Celebrex but I'm taking that too and spacing it in between the ibuprofen. I'm feeling a lot stronger and my attitude is good, I've been grading papers this week and getting a lot done. Hanging around the house has made me feel lazy, I need to come up with some projects - like cleaning out cupboards. I haven't driven anywhere, so maybe I will try a ride today. Although I really have no place to go!

Hip replacement 2 weeks post op today! 
Today is my two week postop day  on my left anteriortotal  hip replacement. I feel like I'm doing pretty well.  I am having some pain but not very much and I am able to take care of that with ibuprofen. I am taking a pain pill at night so that I can settle into a comfortable position for sleep. As for activity,  I am still using the walker around the house to keep my form perfect and keep me from limping, otherwise I am using a cane. When I use the cane too much or ambulate without it, I develop a limp. And that limp then hurts my knee. Today for my physical therapy I worked on doing some steps, putting weight on my operative leg. I am also doing lots of exercises and he now has me putting weight on my operative leg also. I'm feeling pretty good about it.  And ice is my friend. Progress! Thank you all for all of your prayers of support I feel like I'm really doing pretty well. I'm not ready to go walk another Camino yet, but maybe next year!
3/27/17 
3 1/2 weeks since total anterior hip replacement. I feel like I am doing fairly well. I am still using the cane when I feel like I have to walk a longer distance. Haven't used the walker for several days.  I am taking a pain pill at night especially if I've had a long day, I am wearing a fit bit, and yesterday I put in 6700 steps with family being here, and it was too much. My problem area right now seems to be if I do too much I am getting knee pain. I am trying not to limp. But sometimes I feel it's impossible. trying to keep legs up and icing knee frequently. 
My incision has healed well and I have an appointment with the doctor tomorrow to see if I can get into the pool. I live in Florida so that's good and I have my own pool, although it's still a bit chilly. My hip pain is gone but sometimes I feel aching  in my thigh. I am 61 years old and about 20 pounds overweight, so the extra weight is not a help to me. Something to focus on in the future.

"I had anterior right THR 9/13/17 & left 12/6/17. I was doing great until 4 weeks ago used a new electric razor which caused cellulitis on both legs from knees down!!!Put on antibiotics for 7 days which I just finished. I started developing swelling in upper thighs with tender to touch with small amount of pain in my left hip. This is so depressing as I was doing so well. Went to my surgeon took xrays on left hip. Ok. Wants to see me back in 2 weeks to do blood work as xrays don't show infection. Really worried. Anyone else gone through anything similar or have swelling this far out? Also had a medium size dog jump up on my lap so not sure if that hurt anything. Thank you.

"Hi, I was just scheduled for surgery on June 19th.  I have a skeletal dysplasia.  As a result, my hips are a mess; both need to be replaced.  I'm a mom of four boys, a kindergarten teacher, and an active-duty military spouse.  I figured one recovery would be better, especially because I have summers off, and my husband could very easily be deployed at my next opportunity.  I really am an otherwise healthy, active person.  It just hit me, though, how scary the whole thing is.  Has anyone else been through this, regardless of age?  What am I in for?  How long do you think I'll be down?

Has anyone received or have any experience/insights into Stem Cell Therapy for hip cartilage regeneration? 
I am considering this therapy to address the terrible hip pain I am experiencing upon movement.  Xrays indicate my partial hip replacement prothesis (of over 20 years), remains intact thus, I suspect the cause of my pain may be cartilage degeneration or arthritis.
It is relatively new therapy so I would like to hear of others experiences.

"Hi fellow hippies.  Been a while since I was last on this site.  I had RHR with ceramic on ceramic, cements, posterior in July 2017.  My recovery went fairly well until around month 5 when I started to have awful pain in my thigh and at times could not even put my weight on that leg due to this.
I phoned my consultant and was told that I should push through and keep walking and doing normal things as it sounded like muscle problems.
I realised that my lifestyle means winter is a very quiet and inactive time and I spent a lot of time just sitting around.
Spring arrived and 400 ewes needed lambing at a friends farm, so I just got stuck in as there was no alternative.  Chasing sheep, kneeling and crawling around on straw (and mess !!!), carrying pails of water, bales of hay & straw etc for 12 hours every day for over a month.
Well guess what......I realised that my pain in thigh was very rarely there.  I just get odd times it reappears but I can feel that my muscles are much stronger and my mobility is amazing.  I think that the odd times I do get the thigh pain are possibly just a trapped nerve which goes away if I walk about.
My conclusion is that getting back to an active life as soon as able to will improve recovery.  
My husband recently broke his finger when lambing and had it put in a cast.  He continued with the lambing alongside me as best he could and when he had a check up after 2 weeks the doctor was amazed at his recovery and flexibility of the affected finger, saying that he had 80% of movement in the finger which was more than he would of expected even after 6 weeks!!!  My point is that this also proves that so long as we are careful, getting back to normal activity actually improves recovery.

"So 12 weeks out. Overall doing well not using cane anymore. Still need more strength but that is slowly improving. 
They added 2 cm length to hip and now struggling with tightness and Back pain. Almost all my pain since surgery is related to the muscles being stretched.  Seems like every week find something else that is tight.  Surprising how painful muscle spasms and tightness can be. Also, Limited range of motion. Doc says limits are not from bone, but soft tissues. I have never been able to do things like to cross legs, sit Indian style so my muscle not sure what to do and are not happy about it.  He said I will get more range but hard to say how much and how long it will take. 
i wonder how much massage or chiropractor would help.  By middle of day I am so tight and my back is so sore.  Left side of back used to be sore because used back to compensate for hip. Now more central and right side sore. Everything shifting. Ask doc about massage/chiro and he was indifferent. Didn't think it would hurt but did not think really helps much. 
Anyone have suggestions for tightness.  Pt is fine but so slow. Each week we start stretching something that is in knots and by following week something else is in knots.  Also, hard to know how hard to push stretches. I no longer have any restrictions but mentally still worry about hurting hip.  Does heat help.  Maybe a hot tub or heating pad. Frustrated that something is always uncomfortable. Not as bad as before surgery but enough to be irritable, and really limits how much I can do.  Uncomfortable enough that can't get to sleep unless exhausted, so not getting enough sleep that leads to being more uncomfortable.   
How do you find a good chiropractor/massage person. I have tried several in past and  they they all promised great things at first but after a while they all said until hip fixed anything they did would be very temporary.  Just worried will be the same. Just help for a day or two.

"Yesterday was 19 weeks since posterior LHP.  I STILL could not sleep on my side, so went back to my surgeon last Friday.  Xray shows the new hip is doing beautifully, bone growing into it as it should.  But...now he tells me I have trochanteric bursitis which is causing the pain on the outside, and front of the thigh.  He pressed down on those areas and I saw stars!!!  I googled it and sure enough, each and every symptom I have is there. He told me to use heat and then do some mild exercises.  Strangely enough after he told me what it was I had very little pain and was able to sleep on my side all night long!  But just that one night,  Psychosomatic perhaps.  The Google article says the condition can be a result of hip surgery.  Just posting in case anyone else has the problem.  I was greatly relieved to find it was NOT the hip!

I'm new here but have read a lot! I appreciate all of the information and definitely dont feel alone anymore!
I started back to work today...half time for two weeks. I have a desk job. After sitting today for 4 hours (I got up several times to walk), I'm having some pretty deep pain right in the bend of my hip.
Any suggestions on how to avoid this or ideas of how long this will last? (It doesn't help that I really dislike my job and was so much happier while on leave).
Thank you!!

"i too have had nerve damage directly following THR. I am due an exploratory op in 2 weeks on my right bottom cheek to find out if nerve has been compressed or overstretched & hopefully put right but told no gntees. 
I have to say I was devastated to see my right foot was pointing down & turned inwards when I came round from hip op a year ago. Also recognise all the painful symptoms. Those electric shock pains started approx 4 weeks after op only 2 hours sleep at 2/3 hourly intervals I didn稚 think I would be able to live with it but it gradually settled down to numb & tingling down right side of lower leg & foot. Sometimes lately have had shooting pains in ankle and toes but still no luck in lifting ankle & toes upwards.  I have had EEG eventually and told it probably will come back with a great deal of exercise & physio.
I have had my automatic car adapted so that I can drive with my left foot after taking a couple of lessons to control pressure on pedals etc so I feel I have some independence. I still walk with a ridiculous gait and limp but try to aim in getting steps up each day to strengthen. I am hoping next op will be of some help and hopefully not make situation worse!  I had no idea this could happen and obviously signed off with out reading the paper thoroughly beforehand. Lesson learned!

"Ok, just need more advice. Been over thinking my upcoming THR on May 7. I had met with 2 different surgeons so I could pick the one I felt most comfortable with. Now I'm having doubts about whether I picked the right one because I was told by my chiropractor that my leg on bad hip side was slightly shorter than my leg on good side. I mentioned this to surgeon and he didn't address it. Don't they normally take measurements or something to make sure of everything? I know if there is leg length differ nce it can be an issue after you are healed up. Should I ask before my surgery if this needs to be looked into so it can be corrected during surgery if needed?

"Five and half months after my operation I am in such pain in my lower back . I have been left with a leg discrepancy of 2.7cm. The surgeon said that my bone cavity was to narrow  for the pin and so he had to leave the replacement joint proud as the X-ray shows . This has left me with incredible pain in my lower back . Surely he could have used a different sized pin . My narrow bone cavities would have been obvious on the pre op X-ray . The whole experience has left me so depressed as my quality of life is far worse than before the operation

"I had a THR of my right hip posterior on Jan. 3 so I am 13 weeks out. I used a walker for 6 weeks like my doctor wanted then switched to a cane. But I am still walking with a very noticeable limp & discomfort. My hip feels great, but now my lower back on the right side seems to be straining to hold me up, which is causing the limp. I am also very lopsided. I'm still going to PT twice a week and my therapist noticed that my surgical leg looks longer than the other one. I went back to the doctor & he took current x rays but said my leg length is fine - my scoliosis is causing my surgical leg to hike up making me look lopsided. He said the only thing that can be done is PT & it might not work. So now, after the THR, I can't walk normally or very far. Has anyone else had an issue with scoliosis & a hip replacement?

When asked about the dislocation risk he was reassuring instating that the only cases he gets are from px's falling down stairs drunk, getting into brawls or farmers being trampled by cows.
He made a big issue about man spreading when putting on socks and shoes whilst turning your heal inwards to form a figure four. He even suggested I could play squash again after three months!!!! Don't think we will be trying that!

"I wonder if anyone can tell me how long the recovery time (being able to go back to work, drive etc) is for a THR where the surgeon fractured the femur and had to do revision surgery a week after the original THR was done?  The hip replacement became unstable and the fracture made bigger when I was told I could partial weight bear whilst in hospital.  The surgery included a longer stem being used and wires being clamped around the bone to hold the femur in place.
I had to have a week's complete bedrest before the second operation, and have been told to use crutches for 6 weeks (full weight bearing).  I had my other hip replaced in July and was back at work after 6 weeks.  I am doing the physio exercises as recommended by the physio team, but still can't walk very far and cannot walk up the stairs using both legs.  I am just starting to use 1 stick when walking round the house.  I had the surgery done 5 weeks ago.
Thanks in anticipation.

I have been reassured by my consultant and the anithestis that they are happy to carry out the procedure.
I am currently on two crutches in constant pain and unable to drive.

"I have had two hip replacements six months apart, by two different doctors.  The first hip was my right, 1 year ago, the second was my left hip 6 months ago.  I have developed a limp which I guess is T-gait.  As I step forward with my left leg, it turns slightly outward (makes a little circle) and lands on the inside of my heel.  My shoe is turning inward and I'm walking on the side of my shoe.  Was told by PT I have T-gait.  However, the surgeon who performed the last hip replacement on the left side is saying the problem is cause by the right hip.  He said this because I am able to stand on the left leg without holding on.  When I try to stand on my right leg the left knee turns to the right leg and I'm off balance.  I have no hip pain, but have started to feel pain in my left knee.  I'm guessing from the way I walk.  I still use a cane for short distances, walker for longer walks and can move fairly quickly.  I'm interested in opinions, as to which hip is the culprit.  I plan on going to a third surgeon for an opinion.  Hopefully, there is still  time to improve my T-gait.

"Hello, I am a 22 year old female, a college soccer player, and a member of the military. I first experienced pain deep inside my right hip when I was 15 (2011), after running a half marathon. After months of PT it was determined that I had torn my labrum. In November of 2012, I had surgery to repair the tear and was back to soccer by the end of February 2012. However, my surgeon had discovered that I actually had hip dysplasia. I never really felt 100% after the surgery, and there would be times in which my hip would ""pinch"" and then ache for a few minutes up to a few hours. Soccer was do-able, but really not that comfortable. 
I then got to college and played two years of soccer with manageable pain, but in August of 2016 I began to feel a greater amount of pain than I had in the last couple years. My new surgeon suggested the head of my femur was a little irregular, and that could be the cause of my re-torn labrum. I had surgery in April of 2017, and missed out on my last soccer season. I was on crutches for 6 weeks and in ""recovery time"" for 6 months. I gained a little relief, but to be honest i still feel the same pinching pain when i cross my legs, squat deeply. or bring my knee to my chest. I don't know if it's in my head, or if there is any medical answer for this. It's been 6 years of hip pain so any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.

"Hi everyone. I had a posteriorTHR of my right hip on Jan. 3. My hip joint was bone on bone at that point. I had physical therapy at home and then continue to go to outpatient PT twice a week. I still have a very severe limp, to the point that I need to use a cane. Looking at myself in the mirror, I am very lopsided. My PT gave me a lift for my right shoe that is 3/8"" and it made a little bit of a difference. I added another 3/8"" one and my hips are almost level. This is a 3/4"" or more leg length discrepancy. At this point I don't think I will be able to walk without a limp unless I wear some sort of lift in my shoe. I didn't limp before the surgery, so, in a way, I feel worse off than I was before. I'm not in as much pain but I need a cane to walk. Has anyone else had this problem? Any advice?

"My surgeon has me scheduled to do this next week. I'm 1 year post hemi replacement and still having pains in my groin area and upper hip. MRI (MARS) showed nothing of any importance, so this was the next thing to address.  X-rays all look good but show a small area of thinning on the socket. The Dr did not do my original surgery - I had to find a new competent Dr to help me get through all the issues I'm having.  He seems to think that because the OS put in a partial that it needs to be redone to a full hip replacement. I can't quite understand how having this injection is going to make any difference in his opinion of me needing to redo the hip. He seems to think no matter what, in time it will need to be replaced. My issue with the injection is what I will feel like coming out of the procedure and will it set me back in my recovery.  Everytime I try something to help myself I have a setback in my recovery. My Posas is inflamed right now due to me trying
to gain strength in my glute muscles. If anyone has had this, how was it? Pain, aches?  I am just now starting to get my walking gait better and I'd hate to mess that progress up with a dang injection :-)  I do know the injection will tell the Dr more about the pain and where it is coming from but at this point does it really matter?

"Left Hip replaced in 2014.  Heterotropic Ossification removed in 2015.  And, again in 2016.  Severe pain returned in 2017, and the cup liner and ball were replaced in October 2017.  Then.... A rather nasty Staph infection took hold, so a ""clean-up"" surgery was performed in January 2018.  A PICC was also installed for daily IV antibiotics, plus oral antibiotics as well.  Numbers fell after 6 weeks, and PICC was removed (still on two oral antibiotics).  Went into PT with the idea to get rid of some of this severe pain.  After 4 weeks, pain in the groin got severely worse and numbers creeped back up.  Both Ortho and Infectious Disease wanted to do a full ""pull out"" with antibiotic spacer.  The blood work from yesterday showed the numbers down again. Now it maybe just the cup being replaced.  Am I crazy to just to want to get this approached that the infection is still there? I asked that we monitor the bloodwork for several more weeks.  If there's still even a slight infection left in there, then we need to pull everything and start new.. Or am I crazy?

"Hi all. It's been a while since I posted something. I had a THR 6 months ago and am still unsure as to what I can't and can do! My recovery has been fine and I feel back to normal. However I have been given mixed messages by 2 different consultants I have seen since my op. My first consultant suggested there were certain things I wouldn't be able to do, simple things like kneeling down/running/! I am lucky enough to have 4 grandsons, 3 of them are 2 years old, so they are mainly at floor level! One of the reasons I was keen to have the surgery was so as I would be able to play with them without being in pain. I have recently started kneeling and sitting on floor with them, even chasing them around on my knees etc. Am I putting myself at risk? Also I love gardening, so that involves kneeling down to plant/weed etc. And some housework involves the need to kneel down. Would welcome any comments. Thanks.

I am hoping that some one can help me. But before I start I am want to express my sympathy with all of you in pain and suffering. It must be devastating to live each day like that and I feel genuinely sorry for all of you. I hope you will find a solution soon.
Please try to help me. My moth has doen surgery for a total hip replaceent 1 year ago and is still in extreme pain.
I personally think she has two problems. First with her wound/scar and second with the hip itself.
The first because her scar/surroundings of the wound is still extremely painful and sensitive. Even looking at it already hurst and this makes it almost impossible even wear clothes. This problem I suspect must be related to nerves maybe encapsulated by the scar tissue or something. I am not sure.
The second problem must be her hip or the prothese or something related. She has extreme pains which start in the morning. While still lying in bed, she is almost without pain but then getting up and even walking to the bathroom is enough to invoke the pain again. Then during the day active or inactive the pain worsens till a point where she canｴt do anything anymore. Sit, walk, stand it all hurts. Riding a bike is still best for her and walking small distances also but sitting is terrible. So why if in inactive stae in the morning is she ok and when she starts moving the pain incurrs? This must be because of the hip or prothese which must invoke the pain. Either the replacement is too big, wrongly placed, causing whatever. Right? I am not sure but still after 1 year no one, even a second opinion was able to shed some light on her state. No one is able to find a casue of the pain nor for the wound nor for the hip.
It is terribly frustrating that after 1 year no one seems to be able to help and give up on her. I kindly ask anyone with similar sympthoms to contact me, it might help a lot and we would be eternally grateful.
Thanks in advance.

"Hi I'm 31 and had been living with AVN for 15 years. Finally went through surgery after a year of cortisone shots followed by 4 months of hydromorphine for the pain.i over compensated for many years which made my left leg a lot shorter. Following surgery I was told they had to lengthen my leg a significant amount. Anyone else go through the same thing? If so any help with recovery and the awkwardness of having a leg longer than the other would help immensely.
Thank you

"Picking  your brains again.  Had serious groin pain after op. but thank goodness that has eased with the help of muscle relaxants.  My leg doesn't hurt to walk on but the groin and thigh hurt a lot if I try to lift it when lying down.  Feels as if my thigh is on fire.  Is it okay to still have these problems 6 months after the op?  I'm not a hypochondriac and maybe I'm being overly optimistic to expect to be pain free already.  Does it ever feel like your own hip or is there always some discomfort?

"Hi All-
I had a RTHR (anterior approach) this past June. I was just at the Surgeon's office today because my left hip has been really bothering me. I knew it would most likely need to be replaced too and apparently it's time. The X-rays show it's deteriorated a lot since November. I am not looking forward to going through another surgery! It's been 10 months since the 1st one and the recuperation from that one was very slow. I am only now beginning to feel normal but it's so hard to tell how I'm doing since I have chronic pain that makes you feel bad overall. The PA ( I didn't see the surgeon) said it might make sense to have this one done posteriorly because they are better able to see what's going on inside. Since I have, in addition to groin pain, a lot of outer thigh pain probably due to bursitis or tendinitis or both this might make sense. Has anyone had one of each and if so, can you tell me how you made out? I know the recovery is supposed to be easier and there are less restrictions with anterior but I am interested in the end result.
Thanks.

"Hi
Now on day 5 of LTHR and would never have believed the pain I was in on initially getting out of bed the whole experience was far worse than I expected. The operation itself on Thursday was ok with a spinal block and sedation. On the Friday had to stay in bed due to low blood pressure with high temperature all weekend. They let me out Sunday evening and from Monday have felt loads better walking outside with 2 crutches for 100 Mts every 2 hr and been told to increase distance every other day but plenty of rest inbetween. I can already get around the house on 1 crutch which my surgeon says I can do but must continue on 2 crutches outside for 6 weeks. Just for the record forgotten what the procedure is called but he went in from the side of my thigh and put in a ceramic stem with a uncemented titanium socket
And today down to just 2 paracetamol every 5 hours.
Long way to go just hope it keeps improving.

"I had my second stage revision a week ago. It seems to have gone OK. Most importantly there are no signs of infection. I have a huge scar, though unlike some I'm sort of proud of that. I had a small problem with fluid leaking from the wound and soaking my dressing (and leg) but the nurse in my surgery put a very absorbant dressing on and all seems to be contained now. I haven't had any pain to speak of they kept teling me it would start to hurt ""when the epidural wears off"" and ""when you start moving more"" but it hasn't. They had to remove some of the bone so I have a longer than normal shaft.
Walked about 1 mile yesterday and intend building it up slowly.
It's been a slow process but with luck it's downhill from here.

"I am coming up on my 12 week post Anterior approach of my RTHR, I was told my OS that I had hip dysplasia and had worn out my cartilage. I cried when he told me the only option left was a total hip replacement surgery. I am only 50 and always assumed this surgery was for the elderly. After long thought, many sleepless nights - I opted for the the surgery. I wish I had been more informed as to the slow recovery because my OS said I could go back to work after 3 weeks. My OS must have had a Resident open my incision and close it because on the upper part of my incision my skin is pinched, it hurts and isn't a pretty, straight line incision, it's a little jagged on top and seems to be turning into a keloid with thick scar tissue that I massage 2x a day. The hip though is amazing, going up flight of stairs since 2nd day after surgery, returned to work after the 3 weeks (a bit too early as the incision was really still raw) but am now able to work my full 40 hours as a Paralegal. I walk with little to no pain in the hip, no cane and not even limping at all. My question is - has anyone else ever had an incision problem like mine?

BTW, my OS is a teaching physician for Duke, as he put it ""I have 18 years experience with a line of residents working under me'! Wish I had asked if a resident would open and close me.

"so what do you do to combat the depression and hopelessness you feel because you deal with pain all the time...... Pain can be unrelenting..... it sucks!  I find that Pain Medication does not really get rid of the pain.  It just improves my ""tolerance"" to the pain......
The doctor always asks me....... Well Mrs Collins..... what is your pain number on a scale of one to ten??....... I always laugh and say that it is a 15....... My doctor hates knowing that....... last month when I was there we started a new pain medication regiment that has greatly improved my tolerance to the daily bone pain which is still a 15 when I do something a joint doesn't like! ..... When I went to see him the other day and he asked me what my pain level was I said a 15........ he was shocked as he thought the new pain regiment had begun working....... I looked at him and laughed! Again he gave me the look ...... I told him that he needed to ask me the real question..........  What is my tolerance to my bone pain today?...... that is really the question...... and he would have gotten a response he may have liked!  With the new pain medication regiment I am now a 4-6 in Tolerating the pain........and that is a tremendous improvement from a couple of months ago when I was ready to look for a way out.   
Quality of life is an important issue to me........ I have lived with Degenerative Bone Issues since childhood........ when younger I lived on Motrin...... how I miss Motrin which ruined my tummy...... Motrin helped me get through the day when I was younger as there was never a time my bones did not hurt.  As I got older and the joints degenerated to the point of needing replacements that could not be done...... the pain has become at times unbearable....and I have learned a lot in my years of dealing with constant pain.....
I want to share a list of tools I have found and used in my lifetime of combatting bone pain.  My favorite weapons are Laughter and Music......I have learned a lot about herbs...... Lavender (edible not ornamental) is a natural anti anxiety medication......  Arnica.... for pain..... Mints.... for tummy....... Ginger and Cummin...... don't know why adding them to a tub soak works but it does....... Swimming or walking in a warm indoor pool brings me the most relief of all..... OMG..... in the pool..... I don't want to come out!  Hot tubs work well for those who can climb in and out without a cherry picker..... hot tubs with soaking herbs..... also if you can get in and out.....squat down and up..... I cannot anymore....... Before we moved to Modesto I had a custom Japanese soaking tub in my master bath.... I would soak for hours to help with the pain...... my husband would find me in a candle lit bathroom with soft jazz or classical guitar music..... sound asleep! ......
Don't let pain isolate you!  If you have no family find a support group. Go t a pool that provides Aquatic therapies..... you will find a lot of people in the same situation as yourself......
I am an old hippie that does make and use edibles which I swear by...... they work...... 1 cookie or cup of tea before bed and it is nightly night for at least 4 hours and that is a lot when otherwise you only power nap...... I have friends that get 8 to 10 hours of sleep with a cup of Lavender Tea and a cookie or candy..... I am sure big pharma doesn't want anyone knowing this as then we might not buy their PILLS.......
Acupuncture and Massage help.
Gentle Stretching and Walking help as lack of movement locks me up........I also use to color.....but now can't hold the pencils but it was easy to loose myself in a coloring project.  I do listen to books on tape as my eyes are bad..... even with glasses lol..... 
So what am I missing in my fight against pain...../????  I would love to hear of more Ideas........

"THP in Dec of 2016 and the doctor chipped a bone in my femoral head. He used glue and sewed the boned back in place. I was on a walker for 8 weeks due to very soft bones. 9 months after surgery, I could not put weight on my leg. I had second surgery (as a last resort) and doctor found that the bone had displaced so they removed it. 4 months later, I tripped and had a stress fracture in my foot, same my leg.  I wore a boot for 6 weeks. As soon as I took the boot off, I had severe pain, again in my femur. Doctor says the symptoms sound like a stress fracture. After X-rays, nuclear bone scan, hip aspiration, cat scan and two Orthopaedics, I have no answers. The  hip is not loose and not infected but I cannot walk more that about 50 steps without pain. I have been on a cane for 6 weeks and no better. 2nd ortho wants an MRI. 3 months ago I started proliia and bioidentical hormones to strengthen my bones. Thinking of going to Johns Hopkins. I feel so out of control and depressed. I don稚 know what to do. I feel like my care is not coordinated and I am getting nowhere. Any ideas?

"HI,
I am new to group and could really use some input from you. I had a total right hip replacement on March 1. I was bone on bone and had severe osteo arthiritis. I started have issues last August, found out I needed a replacement in November. I was limping from about last summer, and I had to start using a cane at Christmas. I am using a cane and getting around well. But somehow, I feel like my operated side is slightly higher than the other. I also feel like the operated hip area is very stiff/tense. I am still limping when I walk. I had a 3 week post op visit, xrays and doc said all is well. But, I'm noticing this issue more as I am walking more. Normal? not normal? I need advice.
Also starting outpatient therapy this weeek. I had in-home therapy 3x a week, but the guy was lousy, only stayed here 15 minutes on average. I am 50 years old.

I had a posterior THR a few days ago. Recovered nicely. Don't need to many meds. Walking and excercising ok. 
Interesting i I intervened early as everyone I talked to said I wish I had done this five years ago. So I did! 
My main preop problem was muscle pain around my hip and aching at night. Unless I was very active during the day and then my hip hurt a ton. Of course very limited range of motion like everyone!
but as I read your posts and even my sister had immediate relief from pain post op. Not so for me. The same muscles that hurt then hurt now. I still have that aching at night. I know it's very early, but it seems like there should be some change from before until after. 
I will remain patient and totally optimistic, but I'm glad I found this resource I have an opportunity to speak with you.

"Hi, 
i hope this topic is ok to bring up on this forum! 
I am having trouble finding any information online about this. 
I had a THR four weeks ago. Prior to my hip replacement I had a LOT of pain having sex. I知 a 48 year old female and the only position we could manage in the end was spoons with my leg slightly raised and even then that was painful. 
Im hoping that once all my muscles around my new hip have healed that I will again be able to flex my hip enough to at least do the missionary position again! At the moment my hip doesn稚 feel any more flexible than it did before and I知 wondering if this is because the muscles have become tight through not flexing them all those years before my hip replacement and whether once I知 healed up if I値l be able do exercises to lengthen those muscles in order to be able to enjoy a sex life again!! 
I know this is early days, but it痴 been bugging me and as I知 not able to test my theory out yet as it痴 still too painful and early days,  I was wondering if anyone could shed any light on the subject. 
Thanks.

What I took from it was that it is rather too early to draw any definite conclusions but there is a likelihood that running could reduce the life of a prosthesis by about fifty per cent.
Google sports participation following total hip arthroplasty
Happy reading! Cheers, Richard

"Surgery was Monday. THR with posterior incision. The first day and night was ok, 
The pain was well controlled with narcotic and a muscle relaxer  and I got up and walked a little. Tuesday the PT people came and we walked the hall and did more exercises.  They weren稚 hard or painful to do, but I felt like I had been run over with a truck after.  Arms sore, hip painful on the outside and groin. Got on more of a set schedule with pain meds and slept in longer chunks of time. Weds. I went home. Still on regular med schedule, with my husband waking me up at night to continue.  Slept between pills at night.  Pain was more intense and it seemed that the hip was now fully thawed out from anesthesia. Uncomfortable staying on my back all night.  Thursday, same intense pains, groin pulling, leg noticibly swollen, outside IT band sore and tight.  Knee hurts. My leg is longer - the surgeon said it was -and I feel like I知 walking on a slant. The plan is to fix that when he does the other hip in the fall.   Friday, today, leg very much more swollen, upper leg down through the knee and even my ankle.  Those compression stockings are difficult to get on but I bet they are keeping the swelling down. 
All in all, I am glad I got it done.  The awful pain in the groin and hip joint have been replaced with surgical incision pain, groin pulls and butt pain, which I can manage with meds and ice, lots of ice. 
Those who have gone through this know exactly what I知 feeling right now.  To those who are waiting for their surgeries I say, do it.  It is well worth it.  The pain I am having now will fade, every time I get up from resting, I feel like I can move a little better, so it痴 going the right way.  Thank you all for the encouragement.

"Hi all...in September last year I had a knee replacement..long recovery however I am still getting pain down leg and some restricted movement , physio said a while back that my muscles would be weak and tendons shortened so I've just been doing more excercise..I had my final consultation with the surgeon a couple of weeks ago and mentioned this .he sent me for an x-ray of my hips only to find the hip on the operated knee side is bone on bone ...this at least gives me an answer to the pain ! Hip consultant says no other option other than hip replacement.i got to admit I wasn't expecting to have another major operation within a year and am obviously upset and worried...for those of you that have recently had it done how was it ? Is it a long recovery? Have you noticed benefits ? I'm 56 and from UK ...any advise welcome

"Hi guys, I'm new to this forum but figured I needed to start speaking to people that have gone through the same surgery as me as I'm finding online info rather conflicting.
I am 9 days out following a complex, THA. The surgery had major complications and I was very unwell post-operatively. As a result, the majority of my entire, operated leg is now numb, coupled with severe swelling to the thigh and knee. I was being investigated in the hospital for compartment syndrome as the swelling was so severe but this was ruled out by day 4.
My question is, has anyone else experienced 'Severe swelling and if so, how long did it take to get under control? I've ordered a sports I've pack online as the frozen stuff doesn't appear to be wrapping around my leg properly. I'm also gently mobilising with my frame around the house at regular intervals. I'm trying my best to do the exercises but these can only really be performed on the bed and again, it's a real struggle to do/if not impossible with a very heavy, numb leg.
I'm totally at my wits end as I was kind of shoved out if the door of my hospital on the day of discharge with no proper information, particularly regarding the above. The next time I'm due to see a health professional is a PT assessment on the 4th April.
Thanks in advance

"Have been doing well after complex primary thr. Was walking up to 2miles. 2 weeks ago had sharp pain after walking almost 2 miles with cane. At pt, he found IT band with knot in it. Uncomfortable massage and sore but seemed improved. Yesterday while walking a few blocks had sharp pain with each step for about 10 steps. Pain then stopped.  This morning again had pain multiple times with walking very short distances around house. Now afraid to walk. Back sore because I am favoring good leg and limping to avoid pain. Thought about going to er but not really in pain now. Last few hours no pain with walking but have avoided walking much.  Worry about wires and clips in femur but both pt and doctor said they would not cause any problem. Not sure what to do. Had surgery in another city so seeing doctor in not easy option. Is this part of normal phases of recovery?

"After left THR, part of my surgical wound didn't heal as well as we hoped. After doing wet to dry dressings for weeks, doctor had me start using the wound pump and from the beginning there was an improvement in the healing. I used it for little more than 3 weeks. (It would have taken about 6 weeks to heal at this point using the wet to dry technique. Could have been longer.)
Today my doctor told me I can stop with the pump and just use a simple dressing for the remainder of the healing process. He asked me if I'd miss the pump... Nope!
Next appointment with my doctor is in 1 month. That's progress!!
I still have the numbness in my thigh (ice and elevate) and some occasional twinges (nerves and muscles). I usually think of it as my body doing its best to start to return to normal function. I know it will take months for full healing, but that's ok with me. No more hip pain.
Today was definitely a good day!

1.5 years our from THR. Initial recovery in first 3 months was amazingly well, then all hell broke out.  My original surgeon ""released"" me from care and told me activities as tolerated. That was a mistake on his part. No restrictions?  Nope!. Well, I love boot camp style workouts, so I returned to working out.  Initially it was ok but then there were less and less activities I could do, and now I can't do anything with the hips/legs. Original surgeon could not wait to wash his hands of me, sent me to pain management. All PM wanted to do was give injections, which were not helpful. Sought out another surgeon who specializes in THR, and he took an x-ray Dec 2017; radiologist says it normal.  Tests for infection, allergic reaction all normal.  ANOTHER round of PT.  I've had so much PT in the last year!! That surgeon told me he does not do scopes and I need to find someone who will do a iliopsoas release. I found another doctor, his first question to me was if anyone told me that the x-ray from the last surgeon I saw was not normal.  WHAT?? I looked at the x-ray with this new doc and on one of the x-ray views, the femur stem is in a flexed position however this new doc doesn't think that's the problem if it is not loose. Now I had a nuclear bone scan and there is increased uptake at the ball/socket but not around the stem. He offered another steroid injection and/or iliopsoas release surgery. I am just so confused and leary about all of these doctors. Why are none of them confident about what the problem is. I have anterior hip and groin pain - constantly.  Literally cannot bend normal, have to stick my leg out to the side, and then coming back up is so much pain, cannot squat, cannot walk up steps normal, walking in general over 1.5 mph causes pain. I never used to say ""can't"" and the only time I would stop doing physical activity is out of pure exhaustion, but now all I'm saying is I can't do this or can't do that. (Sorry this is taking longer than I thought it would but I guess I really needed to vent). EVERY doctor told me to work on strengthening glute muscles and core. I really want to knock them up side the head. My glutes are not weak, and I have a fairly strong core, considering the exercises I'm able to do without pain.

"Hi all,
I had a total right hip replaced in Sept 2016, titanium and ceramic. Since the second I woke up I have had severe stabbing pain deep in my hip. My surgeon has taken X-Ray of my hip and tells me nothing is wrong. I do have a spinal problem with an undersized disc, but as many have said I know my body and this is not from my back. I'm under west herts hospitals and it seems like they think I imagine it. I'm supposed to be taking loads of tramadol, as well as naproxen, amytriptaline and gabapentine. I work as a postie so before the op I was walking up to 15 miles a day including walking my dog. Now I can't walk to the local shop 600 metres away without a crutch and severe pain. I've had to sell my car but cause I can't earn overtime I get basic hours or did I now get ｣85 a week.
Every time I phone the hospital I get an answer machine and never a call back, it's crippling my life completely. I tried to go back to work but made it worse chucking loads of tramadol down my neck to get through,
Up until the point I was being violently sick. Am I on my own or is this a common thing. I get no answer no letter nothing.

"Hi, I'm 27 years old and had a serious car accident that resulted in me breaking my hip and pelvic bone. I ended up having 2 surgeries and foot drop after my 2nd surgery. I feel like my foot drop is never going to go away. PT has tried the electrical nerve machine thing. (sorry can't remember what the medical term for it is. ) no movement at all even when it was turned up pretty high.  He was shocked! Said my foot drop was one of the worst he has dealt with.  Of course my luck.  I am a single mom of a 7 year old daughter who is my life. I'm so scared I'm gonna be permanently disabled. Surgeon and PT said it is a 50/50 chance that my foot drop will heal and if it doesn't that I will walk with a limp because it throws your gait off and also will never be able to be as active and do the normal activities I did prior to injury.  I am now a little over a month post op. Still in lots of pain. Going through so many emotions. I'm so grateful to be alive don't get me wrong but this has been so life changing. I'm scared for what my future holds. I guess I'm just looking for support. I feel so alone. I'm tired of depending on my mom for everything. My independence is out the window for at least another couple months maybe longer depending on outcome. Tired of depending on pain medications to get by everyday. In so much pain constantly can barely do anything with my daughter whom I miss doing activities with and taking her places. Tired of not being able to sleep.  Just feeling so many emotions. Sorry for such a long post just want to hear from others that may be going through the same thing.  I feel as though I am such a bother and inconvenience to family and friends.  Hope to hear from someone. God bless, Ashley

I was in hospital for 5 days and so incredibly sick, now,  I had been taking hydromorphone for 2 months before the operation as the pain was so intolerable. My hip replacement was the result of post traumatic arthritis caused by car accident. In the hospital they gave me more hydromorphone and 2 weeks post op I stopped taking it altogether. My dr states I am in withdrawal but it has now been 2 weeks. I feels so sick every day, my hip doesn稚 feel great either. I am stiff, and feel like I have a piece of metal in me.

"Hi all,
I am new to the forum. I am 6 weeks from THR of left hip. I had my 6 week follow up with my surgeon today and he was surprised I was unable to walk without a cane. I am 52 and weigh 160 lbs and in good shape. He checked Xray and stated the hip placement looked fine. He also did some different tests and thought it may be hip flexor tendinitis caused by either too much activity or from back arthritis which he has seen on previous X-rays. He did my right hip via a resurfacing 7 years ago and I had no issues and was golfing literally after 6.5 weeks and no issues since. Anyway, has anyone else experienced similar issues with the THR and what is recommended for recovery? He told me to really take it easy, rest, no PT at all. He also gave me 3 shots in my hip to help alleviate the issue and allow for healing. Any similar experiences and solutions would be appreciated. I apologize if another thread covers this, but I could not locate. Thanks !!!

"See below email from surgeon who did my revision & psoas release. 
I am moving better and feel there are improvements albeit gradual. I do take my rehab seriously & strength train. 
I知 hoping that this psoas release does improve as the surgeon suggests.  I do trust his opinion as he did my right hip 6 years ago and it has been problem free from week 6! The left hip was my problem hip done by another surgeon. 
Fingers crossed! 
滴i Inhal
Thanks for your enquiry.
The release of your psoas tendon was necessary as there remained exposure of the tendon to the front edge of the new acetabular component despite me deepening the socket. Leaving it un release would have led to shredding of the tendon & ongoing pain. I would expect full recovery of your psoas function over time but this can take up to 6 months from surgery. You have to realise that recovery from any revision hip replacement is always slower than from a primary THR

"My left hip replacement was last August and I now have an appointment for April 10 for the right hip to be done. Knowing what to expect is not helping me to feel any better about the upcoming surgery than I did the first time! However, I do know that I need to take some snacks with me as the hospital food is awful. And I have also requested a spinal this time as the general anesthesia caused me to have heart arrhythmia and I also had a very hard time waking up following surgery. With the general, I remember nothing about being wheeled to the operating room. What is it like with a spinal anesthesia? I know I will also receive an IV twilight sleep. When is that administered?

"Hello, I was recently told by an Orthopedic Surgeon I would require a total hip replacement.  I am 58 and quite surprised and shocked.  A gradual increase in pain since last fall led me to my doctor and then a referral to a specialist.  He said I was ""bone on bone"".  I have always been active with no particular injury per say that would have led to this.  Probably just wear and tear over the years.  Just wondering if anyone has tried physiotherapy or other things to put off the need for surgery.

"Hi everyone!!!  I just want to thank everyone who replied to my request for advise as to whether or not to move before or after having a THR.   It was a 100% - MOVE BEFORE the operation.   Your reasoning, opinions, advise was GREAT and it helped so much as to making my decision - therefore, I canceled my operation that was scheduled for this April and will be looking to this September to have it done.  In the meantime, I am now getting busy and looking forward to my move - I am doing a little each day and it seems to be working out very well.  I am VERY HAPPY I decided to do it this way - and you are all right - once moved - I can then concentrate on just getting better - no thought or stress of moving!!  I will be back on this site come time I am ready to have this done to get advice, ask questions and updating my process of going through this.  In the meantime, let me wish everyone who is going through this a very, very good outcome and many happy, healthy years ahead!!!!   Again, thank you all for your wonderful input and advice!

"Hi. I found this site helpful before re; two hip revision. 
At 48 I came to Spain from rainy Ireland and within a year hear I'd undergone two total hip transplants- withing 4 months of each other due to sever arteritis. 15 years later my right thigh and leg became extreamly painful especially when turning over at night. It was like a nerve was trapped or a bar was cutting into my thigh down my leg. I was two years on the waiting list in Alicant for a new transplant when the left one just snapped. I had an immediate revision transplant but I had to ho back to the end of the que and now I'm waiting over 14 in terrible pain and with a sever limp. Hospital told me two months ago that there were 4 people in front of me but I am still waiting. I had an embolism 9 months after my last hip transplant and now I'm on Warferan- Sintron- 
Please be careful about flying or lying stationary after hip operations no matter how painful the wound is. Most people I meet at the blood check up clinic made the same mistake.

"Hi
Had left THR Feb 1st and had staples out 12 days later. The wound site wasn't redressed and although tender appeared healed.
However six days ago I noticed that at the very bottom of the wound started to go red no oozing no temperature slightly sore and inflamed. so I put a iodine dressing on and changed it everyday.
Yesterday I saw the doctor and he prescribed flucloxacillin is there anything else I could do to help the wound heal I see the surgeon in 10 days for my six week check up and just want it to be healed

"Hi!  I am 65 and just had a right THR a week ago.  I have browsed through the discussions and there is a lot of good information.  Mostly I just had questions about recovery, but that seems to be well covered and it is very individual.  I quit taking pain medication because it makes me nauseous and I don't have pain until I walk.  My operated right leg has pain on the side and pretty severe pain going up the back of the butt.  It sounds like several have had this same problem.  Haven't had a follow-up appt yet, but I just wanted to check and see what others are saying.  I am thin and (I thought) in pretty good shape, but I feel very tired after walking around after what I would consider not a very long time.
I think I am just impatient and anxious to get on with feeling better.  Any advice would be helpful.

After exactly 1 year I found a good surgeon to do partial psoas release (lengthening) 2 1/2 weeks ago...most of pain I had is groin except severe butt pain located right over butt bone on right cheek towards groin..I see alot of posts on butt pain....I was hoping that this would be taken care of psoas release.
Sitting is painful, laying down is painful....can't stand all the time...Who else has had butt pain and psoas release....In my case the anterior hip replacement was the worst decision of my life. I am in debilitating pain all day!

"Hi!,
      last Sat lunchtime had total hip replacement with epidural. Discharged Monday evening and was looking forward to starting rehab. Reasonably fit 61yr old, so was shocked to find the slightest exertion was exhausting. Feel shaky, have headaches but the leg is great, no pain and increasing flexibility. Had to call in at hospital today so mentioned issues but they seemed happy enough. Never had an op before so didn't know what to expect. Lot of talk about keeping mobile after op but no mention of feeling exhaustion. Par for the course? Do I need to man up! :0)

"I have posted a long time ago and wanted to tell my story again! I am still dealing with serious issues. In Oct. 2016 at age 52 and in good condition I had a full hip replacement, which went out after taking large doses of prednisone for an extended period for a skin issue. After the replacement I did great, was taken off rehab after a week due to being able to walk so well. I was told by my Surgeon a million times to never run on it again. But unfortunately and stupidly on a spur of a moment I ran (hobbled) 30 yards just 6-8 weeks after surgery. I immediately felt a inside tear like stitches ripping. Ever since that day I have had a hard time walking on it most of the time, some of the time it is fine but with any weight or pressure it gets very painful from my groin, left butt cheek, down the top and left side of my thigh to my knee which feels like it is giving out. My surgeon did an Xray every month for a year with no negative results, I kept complaining and he ordered a MRI at 12 months, still negative, he never even told me those results. I found out by going to an ortho guy with my records. He told me I had two ruptured disk in my back, but after discussing with his PT and a highly respected spinal surgeon they both say I still have hip issues. They are doing a nerve conductivity test soon. Then he is setting me up with a new hip surgeon. Can anyone tell me they have had a FHR and had problems and had xrays, MRI, Petscan and all were negative but you still had some issue? Has anyone gone through this with a loose prosthesis in the femur? I was off all meds after 3 weeks postop, now I am having to take a half a percocet everyday to function, still with major pain. I will run out of any medication soon and I have RLS (restless leg syndrome) so any other pain reliever causes major flairups with the RLS.

I had to visit the emergency room 5 days after the surgery due to a fever, one of the test they performed was a blood culture and  they took a ridiculous amount of blood, which made my body to  decompensate  and recovering from that one was one more to the list after the surgery.I'm eating healthy and foods that help me to recover, very low fat food, high in iron, fibre, many dark green vegetables ; but I still thinking, it'll be a good idea to be able to go back to my supplements

"I had my surgery last July 24'th and was back to work in three weeks. The first couple months were awsome I was literally feeling pain free. By month 4 I noticed an increase in discomfort, I saw my surgeon and was told that the x-rays showed everything looked great. By month 6 I was in pain again, I saw my surgeon again, and again was told the x-rays looked great, yet the more I walked the worse my thigh pain got. It has gotten so bad that within 4-5 hours on the floor my thigh has spasmed so bad I can feel every heart beat through my femal artery. I have been off work and in therepy now since January. I have seen progress in loosening up my quads but I cannot walk around the grocery store without my thigh going into spasm. It is extremely frustrating. I am 61 and have always been active, I need to mention I have also had both knees replaced by the same surgeon in the last 4 years. And have experienced no difficulty with either. My hip just seems to be increasing in pain daily. I am at a loss for what to do. I have started using a Tens unit again  to control the pain, and it helps but does not seem to have legs. I know that it will take time to heal, I just want to know why it seems to be getting worse rather than better.

"I知 writing on behalf of my wife,  aged 32. BMI 21.5.
12 months ago she was as fit as a fiddle.  Lots of exercise. Started to get pain in the groin. To cut a long story short,  now she can hardly walk 100 metres and only at the pace of a 3-year-old. She has been diagnosed with congenital (partial) hip dysplasia and given physiotherapy, which made it much much worse.
She saw a specialist 6 months ago who assured her *definitely* it would not get worse for years (I was there too). He was clearly wrong. It was him that recommended physio.
Now GP referred her to a hip surgeon. 
Any advice or information greatly appreciated.  My wife is not against surgery if it will make it better with low risk (we have a young child). Frankly, the way it痴 going in another few months she will be in a wheelchair.
Thank you.

"I am scheduled for total hip replacement surgery this April 30.  Before scheduling this surgery, I was in the process of getting ready to move (another city) - but decided that I should probably get the surgery first as I feel I am a fast healer and tolerate pain well - but now, after reading many comments from people who have had this surgery - there are lots of things to consider - the recovery is or can be long, you are very limited on bending/lifting, etc after surgery -  so having the operation before I move could leave me in recovery for lifting boxes, etc. for many months.  Although I am now limited in mobility and do have pain - I can still bend, lift, etc. - so, I would like opinions from those who have had this done -  do you think having the operation before moving or after would be better.  Actually my doctor said I should move first - but I (of course, I know better lol) thought it would be better to get it over with.  Thanks you for any suggestions, opinions, etc

"Eight months ago I started full weight bearing on a revision of a twenty year old hip both done with the posterior approach and now it is my only support as I had a revision of total ankle joint on the other side.
It was a surgery taking about six hours to take out the original prosthesis and put in the replacement involving a long incision down the front of the foot and two incisions on the inside . Although I seem to be getting around the ward quite well I am finding that I get tired quite quickly and my balance is a bit suspect at times. Posted just in case it may be of interest.

"When my doctor decided I should have the NPWT (wound vac) for helping the wound to heal, I also was prescribed a home health care nurse to visit three times a week which I thought was just to change the bandage and check the working of the pump.
The nurse has done so much more for me. Of course, she checks my vital signs each visit. What is so much more for me are the many questions she asks that makes me realize so much is important in the overall recovery. She asks me about how I'm really feeling in addition to eating habits (Yes, I'm upping the protein intake.), sleeping, pain level (I have high tolerance so need to really think about that each visit), bathroom habits (Some details but nothing I'm adding specifically here.), ability to walk better (Still have some discomfort in the area of the healing incision which affects my overall walking, but I avoid the cane as much as possible now), and many other questions/discussions.
The positive reinforcement, just like these discussions on this site, definitely help with overall good spirits. My belief is that during the recovery, everyone needs someone to talk to. This is more than a physical recovery, but also an emotional one.
Interested to read more  comments about this...

"I was doing great rehabbing with little pain. I was off the can after 3 wks. I was feeling really good and decided I would try and bowl. I bowled 3 games without any problem. I was sore the next morning but everything was fine. Then I went to therapy. I was going through my normal workout when I felt a slight pop followed by a sharp pain that started upper mid thigh down the outside of my leg into my knee. We stopped therapy and put heat on it and stretched. Later that day I started having that pain every couple of steps. Sometimes it痴 just in the lower thigh/knee. Other times it will feel just like it did in therapy. I致e been resting, icing and using my cane to get around. I知 very disappointed that this happened after doing so well. I really would like to know what is causing this pain. My biggest fear is that the stem broke free and if that were to happen will the bone still grow to it.

After walking in the hilly terrain for a month, my limping and pain has practically disappeared.

I assume that walking in the hills strengthened some core muscles .  I only know that it worked and pass it along if someone else has a limping problem

However, at 2 months post op I am still walking with a cane & have groin pain. I have coworkers who have had THR & are back to work after 6 weeks. I am not understanding why I am still walking with a cane and need PT twice a week. The adductor tenotomy was not fully explained to me, but since I have never had hip flexibility, I was all for it. But I'm not sure why I am so far behind in my PT. It's very frustrating.

The pain before surgery had me very depressed and when I had surgery I had anxiety attacks that had me sitting by door with everything off in the house. I now am able to sleep some on operative side and other side. I may experience some groin pain but it gets better with walking more. I am looking forward to the end of the 2nd month.

"I had a THR on my left hip 11 days ago. Had a resurfacing on th right hip 10 years ago. I知 70 but pretty fit apart from the hip.
i used 2 crutches when first discharged from hospital but quickly found it okay on one. I知 doing my exercises and also trying to walk a short distance outside each day. I致e seen posts advising you to stick with two crutches but I feel I知 walking okay, with no limp, and wasn稚 using the left crutch. It means I can carry a cup of tea or whatever in that hand.

"After my left anterior THR in January, the surgical wound in the groin area wasn't healing well so after a few weeks of that, ended up in the hospital for possible surgical closing of the wound. Instead, began using the treatment system last Friday. Saw my doctor today and he said the wound is already getting smaller and healing well. Progress!!
NPWT is short for Negative Pressure Wound Therapy which includes a pump that should be used 24 hours a day.
Exception is for showering or short time at doctor's office when he checked the wound. Less than 2 hours later, the nurse came to my home to put on new dressing and attach it to the wound pump.

"How many of you have fallen more than once post THR?  Myself, three times in the first 11 weeks.  Once was in snow and I guess didn稚 count.  The next time was on pavement and I went down on my knees.  This time I was walking my bicycle in the dark and tripped.  I held on tight to the bike and again, no pain.  Now today.  I live in small town Spain where I question the rationalization and/or intelligence of road construction workers.  Now, planning bike trails is great in cities but having raised bumpers to separate between car and bike lanes is not so when the bumpers are the same color as the road.  They are who attacked me today.  Again, a well planned fall with little pain.   I wonder if my gait is affected by THR or that I am not just cautious enough.

"I am now 1 year out from surgery. Although things have been going well, I still feel like I'm not where I should be.
I still can't lay on my operated side.
I still have to take steps one at a time.
I still need a cane when walking distances.
And I still have slight limp.
I haven't followed my exercises faithfully but I do walk 3 times a week. It still hasn't built up my muscles in my hip and I still have a dent in my hip.
Can hip exercises help at this stage of the game or has the muscle already healed past re-fixing
Thank you!

"Hi I had THR 8 weeks ago last week I told my consultant that I was concerned that my leg was longer that I had back pain and ankle pain in good leg when standing ( one year ago I had my back fused) He said he knew showed me my X-Ray said my pelvis was out of line leg about one inch longer. He said the only way to correct it is if I need the other hip doing the it can be corrected then. I am so upset as his attitude was not very nice. My pelvis was not out of line before the operation. I can't walk or stand without pain as it is putting pressure on my back. He told me to come back in 6 weeks I am seeing my back consultant in May for a check up.

"I had THR 8 months ago.  I was really doing well.  Last week I was making my bed and I felt something in my hip. It didn稚 hurt but just a funny feeling.  I took it easy most of the day and that night we went out for dinner and to Walmart. It really felt good to walk. But hip still felt weird. That night I slept really well .  The next morning I got up out of bed and couldn稚 stand because of the Terrible pain. I couldn稚 even sit on the toilet.  My husband had to help me down stairs .  I thought I was going to have to call the ambulance.  That day I took it real easy. Could stand walk or sit without terrible pain. I got into my orth. Surgeon the next morning but not without taking some Vicodin that I had left from a prior surgery.  X-rays looked fine he said and he ordered blood work and a bone scan.  He told me to stay low and go back on my walker.  I had an appt to get a shot in my knee a couple of days later with him and when I was there he said blood work was good. So there was no evidence of elevation of cell count indicating infection. He told me to keep on walker. My bone scan was scheduled the next day. That was Thursday. Today is Sunday   I do have my range of motion back now and can walk better BUT. I知 still in terrible pain.  Night time is the worse.  I have been icing, heating, elevating, and resting along with taking ibuprofen like it is candy. Also baclofen( muscle relaxer).   We leave for a Florida in 2 days. Dr said to take walker along.  He still wouldn稚 give me any pain meds to get me thru the trip.  
The pain is on the outside of my hip and radiates down out side and in front of hip.  Sometimes it feels better to walk. It hurts to sit lay and stand.  I致e posted about this before but I just couldn稚 explain it that well.  Has anyone had This problem?  I知 preserving what pain pills I have left for our trip to Florida. I know I値l be using my walker and scooters s lot.  As too much walking causes so much pain later.  
Still waiting on bone scan results.

"I'm a 65-year-old woman - just under 10 weeks post-THR right posterior. The first two weeks went well and I was off the cane mostly after 2 weeks. Cane if I was going outside where I would have much walking or have steps without railings. After the home PT ended I plateaued until starting outpatient PT at 4 weeks out. For the next 4 weeks, I progressed, but then started getting new discomfort - sore butt, tight muscles on the thigh, occasional foot pain, occasional shin pain. Sometimes it was outer thigh, sometimes inner , kept moving around. Started driving a little at 8 weeks. Yesterday I drove the furthest I had gone -40 minutes each way to and from my volunteer job (where I had used a wheelchair to get around for a 4-hour outdoor shift). Sat down for dinner and had a coughing fit. (I have acid reflux/allergies/allergies/esophagus issues.) Almost immediately, I felt a weird, painful sensation in my groin - almost like a rubber band had slipped out of place and was pinching me. At the same time I had a sharp pain in my right knee. Now, every time I cough I get groin soreness and sharp knee pain. I also now can't do straight leg lifts and getting in bed is difficult, which it never was before. My knee (around knee cap) throbs. I now can't lift my right leg in a forward position more than a few inches off the floor, so can only get in and out of the shower by standing on tiptoe on my good leg and then can step with the operated leg. Before yesterday. I could march in place (high step) with little pain. Now, when walking, I avoid putting my heel down first and use the toe first to avoid pain. I also had pain last night and today when I tried to do some of my usual hip exercises, so other than ankle pumps, I have left off doing them at all since yesterday. I have followed all the hip precautions religiously this whole time.
Has anyone else experienced this? I am not sure if I should try to work thru the pain, continue with my PT appointment or try to get in to see my surgeon before my next scheduled appointment.
I am also feeling EXTREMELY discouraged. I had thought that, by now I would be recovering nicely. Instead I have more pain and less mobility than I did before the surgery. I've also started having frequent severe headaches, which I last had 30 years ago.

"Hi,
I'm Sue and I had both hips replaced in Feb and Sept 2011. Prior to this I had many years of pain and a great deal of difficulty with medical fields trying to determine what was causing my pain. Anyway once it was decided to replace both hips I was happy they had at last found a cause and what I thought was a solution. My first his replaced was my right and this seemed to go okay, it was a total different story with my left. I have been in excruciating back and leg pain since, I cannot walk any distance or stand for any more than five minutes. I need to use a wheelchair if I go out and crutches also, I am stuck at home all day while my family go out to work - I am frustrated and feel useless.
My pain is across my lower back and generates down my legs, my last three toes on my right foot go numb constantly. The pain is tingling, numbness, sharp, deep pulsating pain and electric shock type pain. The more I try to do the worse the pain gets. I spend most of my time with my legs raised as this helps, the pain never goes away but does ease when resting. I have painkillers and muscle relaxants but they do not really help. My hip surgeon like most of the forums I have read told me my hips are fine according to the MRI scan. He then referred me to the Spinal consultant, after nearly a year of seeing the spinal people they have now turned round and said the pain is not coming from my back and there is nothing they can do to help. I asked them what I was supposed to do and they said they had no answers!! I have attended all the physio appointments and even did a three week intensive course along with hydrotherapy - nothing has made a difference.
I lost my job due to all this pain and I am now registered disabled. I had more mobility (although painful) prior to my surgery than I do now. It was nice to read that other people are going through what I am experiencing (although I would not wish this on anyone) it somehow makes me feel better.
I have had numerous cortisone injections in the hips, nerve block of the L4/5 nothing has worked for me post surgery. I had cortisone injection prior to my surgery and guess what it helped - work that one out. I am now being referred to the Pain Clinic (again) and Rheumatology as it was noticed on one visit to the hospital that I had a butterfly like redness on my face and they queried Lupus (still waiting for those appointments - surprise, surprise).
Thank you for taking the time to read this and if anyone would like to respond I would be very grateful.

"I知 a 63 year old male with avascular necrosis bilaterally.  With left hip being the worst I had a total hip replacement done 12 weeks ago today.
My pain levels seemed normal until about 5 days ago when pain increased in intensity and appeared in several locations, worsening daily. Today pain is worst I致e had at any time since the surgery.
I知 experiencing most severe pain in buttock to side of hip in the area of the hip socket.  There is occasional pain I致e never felt before in my back and groin though not nearly as severe as around the hip socket area.
It痴 a stinging and burning pain with qolts of sharp, brief stabbing pains as if poked with an ice pick or sharp needle. These cause me to jolt in pain but they go as quickly as they come but they come frequently.
There is constant burning pain at left side of hip from area of the hip socket down half way to my knee where I also feel a milder tingling, sticking pain.
Ive never experienced so many different kinds of pain at once.
A week ago i was doing well, off the cane and pain was mild to occasionally moderate and then only briefly.  Now it痴 constant and in the range of 4 to 7 on the 10 scale with quick spikes to 8+ every few minutes, day and night.
Im taking ibuprofen 800 twice a day that helps slightly. I don稚 like taking pain meds. They dont fix the cause, just prevent me from feeling it.  I知 hoping someone might have a clue as to what痴 going on?  And I知 hoping this isn稚 serious or prolonged, but it is a lot of pain I was not expecting.
I致e done nothing to injure the hip, no falls, no running or jumping or anything other than walking around normally.
They池e getting me in to see the surgeon痴 PA tomorrow, actually, in 12 hrs from now as I write this lying here In pain...looks like another sleepless night. Quality of life in this condition is poor.
Thanks for reading all the way through.

"Hi,
I have seen a few discussions regarding pregnancy after a THR. I had my THR 2 years ago now and currently 28 weeks pregnant.
Everything has been going fine, my hip really has been amazing and i have ensured i have looked after it whilst being pregnant.
This is my 3rd pregnancy and having a planned c section not out of choice - had c section with the other two so have to this time also.
For the last week or so i have noticed pain and mobility is starting to become a problem. Iv started having to take strong painkillers to get through the day and to sleep at night. I can feel the pressure on my back and hip joint itself as baby is moving around.
Im worried this is only going to get worse and i still have 5 weeks left in work and two other children to care for.
Has anyone experienced problems towards the end of their pregnancy, if so how did you cope. Feeling that old way before THR. Cranky, frustrated with pain and hardly being able to walk anywhere!

"I had my left hip replaced with the posterior approach in Sept 2017.  Since that time I've had some fairly mild pain, mostly in the thigh muscle.  It hasn't caused me to lose mobility, until the past month or so.  One thing that has changed is that I got a dog in mid-November, thinking it would force me to walk more for exercise.  It's done that, and I was walking 3/4 to 3 1/2 miles each day.  However, about a month ago, I was putting something in the back seat of my car and I felt something give slightly in my left hip/upper thigh.  Since then, my pain has gone up considerably.  It's not a constant pain, but it does happen every day usually a number of times.  At times I can't walk because I'm not sure if the pain will cause my leg to give out.  This is much worse that the first year after the replacement, so I'm thinking something else is going on.
I am slightly allergic to dogs, and I'm wondering whether that allergy might be causing my body to attack the implant.  I realize this is a wacky theory, but I was wondering if anyone has heard of such a thing happening?  If so, is there a test that could be done to verify?  I was thinking of maybe having my eosinophil level checked, which can indicate an allergic reaction.
Thanks,

"Hi folks, I知 a newbie to this forum and would like to share my experience. It will be three years this July since I had my left hip replaced at The Royal Orthopaedic in Birmingham. The consultant who replaced my right hip (two years previous) agreed to replace my left as it was in a bad way. When I woke from the surgery I found out that his registrar had done the op. My consultant claimed he had opened the hip and closed it. After a few days the intense pain began and I felt there was something wrong. I knew from experience that I would need to let things settle down but this felt so different. When I finally had my post op appointment I was told it just needed to settle. Nearly three years on and airing constant concerns to the consultant, I finally was told after having an ultra sound scan I have to have a psoas release. The radiographer also wrote in the report that the cup appears to be overhanging. I致e just had a ct scan and see my consultant on March 6th and I知 dreading it. I致e been fobbed off so many times with 徹h it痴 probably your back causing the problem but now he can稚 do that. I gather he痴 one of a few consultants that can do the psoas lengthening but I知 wondering if I should get a second opinion. I致e read on this forum of another person having a similar problem with the same consultant :-(

"four months ago I underwent THR at the Royal Orthopeadic Hospital in Birmingham 4 days after discharge I email the consultant to say I was in terrible pain ( I had my left hip replacement one year previously so I kn what to expect in pain levels. he saw me 3 weeks later and said it would settle down. He admitted they had trapped the lateral cutaenous nerve which created Meralgia Parasthetica in my thigh but this would go needless to say it hasn't. more seriously having paid to have endless test done privately the surgeon that did my left hip op told me yesterday that my pain is caused by the wrong size implant being used and it is moving in my femure causing all the pain when I try and walk. I am now having CT and ultrasound to prove that diagnosis. If confirmed I will have to have the whole operation done again with more months of rehab. To think prior to this I played golf twice a week climbed to the top of St Paul's cathedral . Needless to say the surgeon that created this has never bothered to contact me since December 2nd . The Royal Orthopeadic Hospital has been useless and don't even bother to reply to my emails and my formal complaint made on 12th December,  for anyone going there beware Mr Mc Bryde's web site makes many claims but be very sure you get a second opinion. The Irony of all of this I am employed by the NHS as a patient leader feeding back to them patient experience looks like I will be doing a lot of typing in the next few weeks

"Hi - I知 after some advice or Info from someone who痴 had a posterior THR like myself. I am 25 years old and live in the uk. I was 4 weeks post op yesterday & so far it has been the most horrific recovery. The day I was discharged I ended up back in hospital as basically I was discharged a few days too early as they hadn稚 got my pain relief under control and so when I got home my body went into shock as the muscle pain was that severe I stopped breathing twice! After speaking with the surgeon and a doctor my pain relief was changed drastically and for the first week and a half I was near enough on the highest of highest you could take. 
Anyhow that is all sorted now I have my pain, i take an odd paracetamol if I need to. 
What I知 after asking is has anyone else experienced the stiffness ? Since the pain went my groin and thigh feel so tight and stiff and it痴 worse in a morning and at night. I do suffer with it during the day but not as bad. I appreciate I致e just had major surgery and my body is still recovering. I went to the doctors yesterday as I have a slight wound infection (not ideal) but I致e got antibiotics to sort that. 
I have my 6 week follow up slightly earlier at 5 and a half weeks as the surgeon is on holiday at 6 weeks and I知 hoping he will be able to then give me exercises or refer me for physio, because as of yet I致e not been given any and I wonder if that痴 also a factor as to why I feel stiff. 
My surgeon explained to me that the older the patient - they have their nerves cut, whereas under 25 you need them so instead what he has done is stretch all three of my muscles and that is why I致e suffered with the muscle spasms. 
I am so fed up of lying on my back, hopefully two more weeks I can turn on my none operative side with a pillow, take these compression stockings off and hopefully be confident with one crutch inside and out.
Has anyone at 30 or under experienced anything similar with the stiffness ? I just want to talk to anyone who痴 had it done as I feel google tells you all sorts of stuff .

Just out out of curiosity I searched the internet for some history of the procedure most of us had and found interesting tid bits.  My curiosity mainly stemmed around how people survived with broken hips prior to modern surgery like in my case where the hip was fractured and the pain is pretty intense.  In the old days people lived with the pain.  
Although a a few of you have suffered catastrophic events post surgery, most here have experienced success in functioning and increased mobility.  Many of us here have lived very physically active lives until we were faced with inmobility which in itself is frustrating and often depressive disability.  Myself, to survive without modern surgery would have thrown me into an abyss.  For some of us, success after THR is just being able to ambulante pain free.  For others, it is the renewed ability to ski, cycle, run, walk (and thus travel), run, swim, etc.  
This is forum is chock full of information on recovery as well as many success stories.  My concept of success is the renewed ability to walk pain free and cycle some.  I swim about an hour a day and run in a shallow pool as well.  When my hip was cracked, it was a progressive decline in ability to ambulate.  The funny thing was that it was more excrusating every day to get to the pool.  Once at the pool and in the water, I could swim pain free.  The trouble getting home on bicycle was the pain of the hill climbs.  
Basically, I am ticklled pink with post surgical success despite the ups and downs in recovery and am curious how others here feel about it.

"Hey so iv not posted in a while but i hope everyone is doing well. 
Basically iv been getting some hip discomfort such as pain around the scar when lying down or moving around tingly sharpness sensations or dull aching. I expected a lot of this as the nerves and muscles change. my leg was twisted at a 45 degree angle prior to surgery so recovery has taken longer. 
i now have as off today dull throbbing acheing pain in what feels like my ""butt bone"" aka ischium and a ""hot""  Wsharp but only dully thobbing pain in the front hip bone aka illiac crest. its annoying me enough to ask if anyone has a clue if this means theres a problem or infection? Iv worried abotu it a few times in the last week to check for heat in the skin. 
I have Ankolyisng spondalytis, on a anti tnf which reduces my immune system thus reducing inflammation and my AS was attacking the joint post injury now it just seems to be aggravating my lower spine/sacrial spine  
I havnt had any infection issues etc so not sure how this weould feel? and im exercising but im not over exercising as when i do that still hurts the surrounding muscles most iv done today is cycle for half an hour so far and sit on a Pilates ball whilst working. 
I dont feel ready yet to call and pester my consultant as i have work tomrorow that i cant avoid so looking for opinions? xxxx

Upper thigh pain is now excruciating when I stand after sitting for any length of time over a few minutes. I sought a second opinion and my PC physician told me that I might need a revision. I'm set up for an orthopedic consult in May. I was so careful choosing the procedure and doctor. Can't understand why I drew the short straw as only three out of 100,000 require revision.

The pain in the front of my thigh is pretty horrible when i first begin walking. At work i am up and down alot at my desk. If I start walking, I'm good, so I figured I could do the treadmill or maybe fast paced walking outside. Does anyone have this pain as well? It's so depressing not being able to work out ... Before surgery I worked out 6 days a week and had reached a goal weight. At what point is everyone finding that they can excercise? Does anyone do cardio yet? Guess I'm not very patient...

"Hello. Im sorry i havent been posting for a while. Quick recap. Im 43yrs old and have suffered from Rheumatoid Arthritis since i was 2yrs old. Nearly all my joints have been replaced, some twice. I got a right revision hip replacement end of August last year then start of October i dislocated it. I wasnt in agony so didnt think it had come out, however i had been getting pain in and around the hip beforehand and surgeon thinks it had been coming out gradually. Im now getting these pains again in my groin area, side of hip and on thigh. Also when revision was done the surgeon broke my femur! I go for an xray tomorrow. Praying its ok. Has anything like this happened to anyone else? Sorry for long post.

"Hello All,
I will be attending a pre- surgical THR information class Tues. 2/13 at 1 PM PST USA.  I'd lke to ask if anyone has suggestions for questions to ask.  As I understand it, the class is led by the primary PT of the hospital who specializes in THR recovery.  I'd like to fill out my list of concerns with any I may be missing and would also welcome the opportunity to ask any questions you might have regarding either your pre-operative condition or post operative condition.  My thinking is the more information we have the better informed our decisions will be.
Thanks and let me know.  Sorry for the short notice.

"Had right hip posterior replacement the first part of December 2017.
  A few days ago while doing steps in therapy I had some pulling in the outer thigh muscle and an extremely painful POP!  The pain almost brought me to my knees.  Therapist and doctor agree that it was scar tissue breaking up.  There's not much about this on the internet. Has anyone else had this happen? 
The thigh muscle above the 'pop' is now extremely sore.  It didn't hurt to walk before but now I am back to walking with a cane.  It is worse when I step forward with the non-operated leg.  I'm doing some prescribed stretches to loosen the painful muscle.  It's been only 4 days but I feel like it has been a huge setback.

"In 2010 I was diagnosed with osteophytes on my hip joint (the cup of the joint was showing bone growth around the rim). Although by X-Ray it looks the same on both hips, it is only my left hip that is obstructed. I can still kiss my right knee, but can't get within 12 inches (30 cm's) of kissing my left knee. Apparently the bone growth is getting in the way, so I have a restricted hip joint.
My doctor and surgeon have told me as the hip gets worse I will need pain relief and then will need a hip replacement. I initially looked into having the bone shaved, but this service is not provided on the NHS in my area and costs about ｣8000, a bit much seeing as I'm in no pain!
I still ski every year, hill walk, went up Scafell Pike, Ben Nevis and Snowdon in the last year. If it does get a bit painful I have 30mg Co-codemol tablets to take; but have probably taken less than 4 in the last 12 months.
So little pain but a restricted left hip. I ""wobble"" when I walk, a limp I don't notice until I see myself on video. Occasionally I get a day of back pain, maybe once every two years.
My physio gave me hip exercises which I do about 2 or 3 times a week, I walk dogs twice a day and occasionally cycle, all pain free. I can't run at all, can't play tennis or football, anything that means I have to take a long stride is out.
How long does this go on for? I have expected for the last 8 years that it would get worse and need operating on. I am pain free, but it's a substantial negative impact on my life. Anyone else in a similar position?
I still paraglide and took my power conversion course last year, but running at launch to take off was particularly bad on my hip, in flight and landings, no problems.
Currently aged 53 but feeling like 83, and I know a lot of 83 year olds in better shape than me!!!!

Very frustrated as will need to return to work immediately after or maybe even before I'm off crutches.  Pt is saying no point in doing any more pt until full weight bearing because really not much I can do between hip restrictions and weight bearing restrictions.   All they seem to want me to do walk as exercise but the only thing that get a work out is my hands, and they are killing me. I'm going to need carpel tunnel surgery on both hands by the time 12 weeks is done.

"Does anyone have any info regarding symptoms to a dislocation before it happens?  I am sp 9 weeks from THR and have functioned rather well barring some minor issues.  Last weekend, in bitter cold, while monitoring a cross ski championship, I had some pain in my upper leg that has the operated hip.  That evening the pain went away?  Last night, when getting into bed I felt a sharp pain in my hip of the salme leg.  This morning the pain persists some.  I can bear weight on the leg, can bend down etc., but cannot move the leg in certain positions.  When sitting, the pain does not exist. 
Like most of us hippy痴 here, I am concerned with every twinge of pain right now.  Agreed, it could just be a slight pull of the muscle that was affected during surgery but I am not sure.  The pain is not intense.  It does not happen during swimming or running in a shallow pool.  I was able to get exercises done but in les raises while standing, there is some pain.  Any thoughts?

"For the last couple of weeks, I've visited the surgeon and he keeps checking on the healing of the surgical wound in my groin area. Unfortunately it is healing very slowly. Today he scraped away some of the dead skin and checked the area. Appears that the underskin area is ok, but it's just going to take time. Special cleaning and bandaging directions given to me for next week. Also will take antibiotics for 5 days as a preventative. No infection seems to exist, thank goodness. Hopefully the healing progresses so I don't have to go back to operating room for resuturing, I will see him again in a week for him to check it.
Other than that, at 4 weeks post op, I'm doing well. I was hoping to use the treadmill, but he told me not until this wound heals. So, just the regular walking.

So far I have had no improvement in the feeling of my inner thigh knee and half lower leg. It is still as bad with also electric type shooting pains. I still need 2 crutches when out dometimes I still use leg brace inside if I have grandchildren as not easy to be with them using a crutch. I now see significant muscle wastage in top of thigh and shin. I can't walk up or down stairs normally my leg muscle won't take my weight to lift me up the step.

"Morning hippies
My friend redressed my wound yesterday lthr 1/2/18 the actual wound and staples looked really good albeit a lit of bruising and swelling.
However about two inches above the op site is a laceration/burst blister that was not covered by the original dressing I noticed that when I sat on the toilet when I stood up fresh blood came out of it and into the toilet bowl.
If I put a pressure dressing on it it stops buts starts to bleed again if I remove it.
Now I realise it is very tight and Swollen in that area but am concerned as to what it actually is as it is not part of the original suture site. Any ideas what it could be I am going to see someone if I can today

"Hi,
Background:
I had a right side femoral neck fracture 2 years ago, which was repaired with a dynamic hip screw, and a THR around 5 months ago after the repair failed (no evidence of AVN apparently - just non-union of the bone).
I have an underlying condition - semi-paralysis of the right side and general lower body neuropathic pain - as a legacy from treatment for lymphoma in 2006.  This disability was the reason for the fall that caused the hip fracture.
Anyway, my recovery from the THR has been uneventful and unremarkable.  I graduated from a crutch to a walking stick a month or so back and my mobility is pretty much back to where it was before the fall.
There is just one issue...
When I get up in the morning or get up from the couch, or from the chair at work, I get quite severe pain on weight bearing.  The pain is pretty much at the site where I imagine the titanium ""spear"" has been driven into the top of the femur (though I realise that pain can be referred from elsewhere), and I also get pain in my knee. 
After 30 seconds of walking around the pain is gone, and I can get about without the stick.
I'm not due to see the ortho until August and I'll have an x-ray and ask him, but I was wondering if anyone had a comment to make?

"My surgeon noticed this about my first appointment about 11 days after surgery. At that time, he said to keep some gauze on the area and he would check it again at next visit. At last visit, he gave me some antibiotics even though he said it didn't look infected. I have to keep gauze on it, changing morning and before bed and make sure it's clean. He told me about 7-10 % of patients experience this. Sometimes he has to do some restitching if he thinks it's not doing as well as it should. I'm hoping that won't have to happen.
I've been walking with a cane but sometimes, later in the day, it's difficult with tiredness. I realize it will take TIME as many people have said.

I came home with my take home meds and notice that the 20mgs slow release morphine has been switched to 10mgs slow release twice a day. Effectively this means my pain relief has been half and I have not been given anything unlike my last hip replacement for breakthrough pain ie 5mgs oxycodone. Do you think I should contact my doctor is it normal to reduce pain relief after only three days I am scared of pain coming back.

Ever since I致e been working on strengthening my left hip my right hip has been getting sore. Understood because I致e been using it more now in place of the left. 
I also feel like the hip on the right catches on something when I have put pressure on it ....say when I知 leaning on it to exercise the left. Or if standing and just leaning on it. It痴 very bothersome and a bit painful. Sometimes it takes a couple times for it to go away. Like something needs to go back into place. I feel it in the groin area up near the upper part of it. 
Does anyone know what this could be? I知 thinking that I may not have strengthened my right hip as much after that replacemen as I could or should have. I found it difficult sometimes as I was experiencing alot of pain on the left already.

"I had my THR in July of 2015 and never recovered, but always had a limp and pain in hip. Finally had second opinion and got a diagnosis of a torn gluteus medius muscle in Feb, 2016. Also had testing for infection but all was negative. I'm finally getting the repair surgery, as well as some exploratory in the hip, by two surgeons tomorrow, after 2 cancellations and seemingly endless waiting. I even had a vertebral compression fracture of my T-11 while waiting, which was SO horrible and painful and worse than my THR.
Now I am ready to see if my hip problem can be repaired, and if I can recover and move on with life. My health has gone so far down the tubes during this 15 months of inactivity that I am wondering if I will ever get it back. I will do all I can to get better, since I have so much to live for - a loving husband, sister and grown children. I love nature and out-of-doors adventures and want to go exploring and hiking again. 
I'll be wearing a brace and be 20 pound weight-bearing for 8 weeks after the surgery to avoid tearing the muscle/tendon again. It is possible they will do a revision if they see a loose stem or cup, but that is not likely. 
This forum was instrumental in me figuring out the source of my hip issues, as within the first couple of replies to my first thread, linda96952 told me about her problems, similar to mine, and put me on the right track. Thanks, again, my dear linda96952! https://patient.info/forums/profiles/linda96952-897026 Many other people here on Patient have been so giving of their support and information that I can't begin to list them all. I had no forum support after my THR and just struggled alone. This time I feel like I am going in with so much information and so many people with me!
Here are my previous threads, as I've been on here forever, trying to figure things out and waiting for treatment.

"I had left hip anterior replacement on Wednesday. Everything went great. I had a little pain my first night, but it was not bad. Last night, I had my best sleep in years, since I no longer have arthritis. I would keep me awake all night. The only pain I have now is in the surgical area. My leg feels very stiff and hard to move. If anyone has advice please let me know.

"Hello, Im almost 4 weeks post total hip replacement and so far I've been experiencing some questionable side effects.
1) Drop foot ( can not flex my foot towards me) upon waking up after surgery. They did a spinal block, which I didn't want.
2) Never ending nerve pain that landed me in the ER 3 times, from the top of the pelvis crest, down my backside, to the ankle.
3) Still numb on the left side of my shin/calf, down to my foot.
4) Painful skin on the numb area, and Itching!
If anyone has had these experiences, PLEASE share, I'd love to read about what you done to help it, and if it ever went away! I went in to get away from pain, get back to work, and OFF pain meds, only to be put on MORE! Ony good thing is that im walker free and can move about. I was let go after my surgery. I have lupus and 7 years post kidney transplant. Also im only 29 years of age. I had to have the replacement, due to long term
Prednisone use, which led to Avascuar Necrosis.

My question is can I have it done after 2 hip replacements? One being just 12 weeks ago. Does it depend what kind of implant it is? 
I致e read that sometimes they can bypass the implant. Also read you need to remove any metal ur wearing such as jewelry. 
I just read an article in which a man walked into a MRI room carrying an oxygen tank and was sucked to the machine because the machine was on. He was told it was off. 
This put a scare in me as I don稚 recall if they have ever asked in the past if I知 wearing any type of metal. I had an MRI done several years ago.

I was a very active person pre-surgery only giving in when I could no longer handle the pain. Had Right leg Ant THR.  At 6-7 wks post op I was doing great, no pain, no walker or cain, moderate walking & stairs ok. At 8 wks I suddenly developed excruciating pain in the middle of my upper thigh when walking and quad muscle flexed with each step. Given a steroid pack but didn稚 help. Saw Dr @ 10 wks where he did an X-ray to rule out all the bad scenarios & decided I had either a quad muscle strain or tear that could just happen without  necessarily doing anything to cause it. More rest, Ice & no exercise except moderate walking as tolerated. I知 now 12 wks post, quad pain is going away and I知 thrilled!!! However it appears I致e exchanged quad pain for groin pain when walking.  Other than before surgery my groin pain disappeared @2-3 weeks post op.  Anyone have something similar or any insight appreciated! Will see Dr again in 10 days.

"I used to be a serious cyclist but had to give up on road cycling due to spinal stenosis.  However I ran across an engineer who was willing to trade me his high end mountain bike for my high end road bike.  Good deal!  Anyway, at five weeks I started cycling around town, mostly to and from the gym.  However, there are few flat roads here in the Pyrenees.  At first I would ride downhill to the gym and took the least steep way home.  Now, only a few weeks later, I take the steep route, very comfortably.  Maybe it is due to lifetime miles?  I discovered very little if any stress put on my hip.  I guess also it is due to staying in a higher gear than previous.  Cycling is the most doctor recommended exercise for recovery from surgery and swimming is next.  Don稚 overdo and cycle or swim with your ego.

"I stopped Hydrocodone night before last and no real issues. Great to not have that constant sleepy feeling. Since I was taking them about every 6-7 hours, decided I could manage. Yesterday was amazing. One difference, not a problem really, was that I didn't fall asleep as quickly when it was bedtime. Since that was my pre-surgery usual, didn't bother me at all. I had a little headache but not sure if that was related since it is gone now. I'm planning to ask my surgeon at Wednesday's appointment  what he would recommends I take if necessary. Thinking it will be acetaminophen since I can't take aspirin other than the dosage (twice a day) I'm on for the next 3 weeks.
I'm also using my cane more often. We keep the walker in the car just in case I need to walk a lot and get tired. I used the riding cart while grocery shopping yesterday.
Continue to have the swelling in my thigh but no pain with it. I use the ice and lie on bed in afternoon, elevating with the ice.
Of course, I'm being VERY CAREFUL whenever I walk and do anything. I know it will take TIME to heal and that is ok. Not having the hip pain is amazing.

I ran more as my leg got stronger and I managed to play cricket during the season, batting and wicketkeeping. First started getting hip pain in May. Thought it was just due to overcompensating for the opposite leg. X ray showed arthritis and bone cams on femur. Now on waiting list for hip replacement. The other hip also hurting a little. Would like to run again after, if not on the road then enough to play cricket. Can swim and cycle at the moment with little pain. Who else has managed to run or be very active after the replacement.

"I saw my Surgeon today for my 6 week follow up since my THR.
He was hoping to lift my hip restrictions but decided not too. He said that my hip should be about 10% flexible but it is 20% which means I have a better chance of dislocating while I am healing. Have to wait another 10 weeks and he will reassess. He mentioned that I will alway have to be more careful. He made my leg 3mm longer as it will give me less chance of dislocating. Also I will need the other one done in a few years and he will make it the same length as the other. In the meantime you cant really tell. Interesting to know if anyone else has been told the same thing?

"For the past 35 years I have been athletic.  When injuries would occur in one sport, I begrudgingly switched activities.  Two years before my THR I was forced to quit skiing downhill as well as serious cycling by my neurosurgeons who noted an issue of stenosis in various sections of my spine.  I took up swimming daily 1 hour and walking more.  I also walked for an hour a day in a pool 4 ft deep.  When my back pain worsened, I quit the small pool and started riding my bike to the gym in the morning.  I continued both even after hip fracture.  Although I could hobble to the pool and ride on flat ground, I swam without significant pain until I could literally not walk.  
Last week, sp 6 weeks THR, my surgeon told me I could swim and ride my bike some now.  Today was the first time I could ride a bit uphill.  Hell, I live in the Pyrenees and there is very little flat ground.  Anyway, I was ready to stop at any minute but I never felt stress on my quads or groin.  Of course, this pleasantly surprised me even though I was riding my 15-20 minute uphill home.  It痴 only 5-6 minutes the other direction.  This was after 30 min swimming laps and a bit in the spa.  After home I walked a mile or two to complete errands.  No Problems, just tired as hell and thankful for the Spanish support of the siesta.  
Bear at in mind that we can support whatever wacky (stable genius)  or other ideas we have regarding any facet of our recovery on the internet.  But, do yourself a favor and thoroughly research any of your desires.  Don稚 jump into physical exercise if you don稚 have a solid physical base to build on.  Also, physicians recommend what they learn to be correct through many sources.  The funny thing I discovered in my meetings with neurosurgeons was that those of them who were cyclists themselves, strongly encouraged it for exercise but those who were not did not.  
My research indicates that swimming and cycling are good exercise post THR but anything to an excess is bad for you.  Prior to physical issues I was climbing in the Pyrenees daily on a road bicycle and before that in the Rockies, in the US.   Now, it痴 only in moderation to the gym and home as well as around town because I do believe the bike vibration from a road bicycle is bad for stenosis caused from falling from many bikes.  You only have one body, use it Safely.  Just some thoughts.

So, my concerns are...many emotional/teary times I can't explain, inability to do left knee lifts, and exhaustion. I take mild pain med about every 6 hours. Unusual for me to take meds but know this is a must... for now. Will see surgeon on Friday for first post up visit.

"Hi fellow hippies
Today is my 8 week annivesary post left posterior THR. All going well and I'm now able to walk around the house mostly with only occasional use of a walking stick or crutch. Still using a single crutch on trips outside. Can now climb stairs normally - not the earlier one step shuffle. Exercising religiously and walking outside whenever the weather allows. Also passed a ""milestone"" this morning when I managed to put on my left sock unaided.
My only concern is that I also tried to turn onto my operated side early this morning before getting up and almost immediately had to turn onto my back as I experienced quite a lot of discomfort around the area of my scar. This eventually subsided. When I got up I checked the scar and there is no sign of any red areas or other untoward evidence that a problem exists. Since the operation the scar has behaved impeccably and healed well.
I'm just wondering what others have found as far as being able to sleep on their operated side. I'm wondering if there is still some underlying nerve/tissue damage that is causing the discomfort and that this will improve with time.
FYI my hospital discharge notes describe my prosthesis as a ""Plastic cup/ Excia uncemented ceramic bearing.
I presume the uncemented means that the stem of the prosthesis is not cemented into the femur but is designed to allow bone growth around it over time to fix it in place. Just wondering if that process could also be a source of the discomfort.
Any comments/thought appreciated.

"I'm 45 and had a my right hip replaced 7.5 weeks ago.  Some days are good some days are bad with pain and feeling of discomfort, awkwardness, tightness and pressure in the joint and muscles when I'm walking.  I'm still using one crutch when I'm outside but was trying to build up the distance I could walk unaided.  However in the last couple of weeks, perhaps down to some more intense physio I've been given to do every day, I've not really been able to go without my stick at all.  I feel like I should be starting to get used to the feeling of the prosthesis but it doesn't seem to get any more normal.  Walking even with one crutch feels as though the joint wants to bend in an awkward way.  The pressure to stay upright and walk without a limp can be tiring.  Today I've got shooting pains in my groin and down my leg to my knee and shin, as well as below the scar, which feels different from previous days.  Has anyone experienced any of this and is it a normal part of the healing process?

"Posted yesterday, but only 1 response. Try to make a long story short:
At 39 needed a THR due to excessive use and arthritis. Was just bone on bone in left hip. Had it done May of 2012. To this day, I  still have pain in hip. Mainly where the incision is. If I move suddenly, stub my toe,or turn quickly it feels like a knife is being stuck right inside my scar area but way deeper. Also seriously affecting my knee on the same side. I admit I did not get therapy after surgery (stubborn athlete mentality). I did have 12 weeks of therapy 2 years ago, which after the therapist said there is nothing more we can do for you. ITB band is super tight. But I do not believe that is the reason for my pain. Tired of going to Doctors and getting same reponse: We are not sure what is wrong. Try stretching, and rolling on foam. Done it all. Still not better. Its sad to say I am looking forward to this hip failing, to have the next surgery to hopefully feel better. Any thoughts would be helpful.
Thank you,
Mike

"Hi
I thought I'd relate my current situation si that if anyone else experiences the same they will be able to identify the cause much quicker than me.
On Sunday 14th Jan I started week 5 post op posterior LTHR and the recovery during the first 4 weeks has been excellent. I'm had very little pain, progressed from 2 crutches to one and I do my exercises every day.
Sunday was no different during the day, but about 4.30pm in started to complain about being cold. I live in a ground floor apartment, and the place is never cold. Shortly after I started shivering and then about 6pm my whole body started shaking uncontrollably and I had pain in both groins. I went to bed with a hot water bottle and after about 30mins of this shaking and groin pain, it subsided.
the next day started like any other, I felt fine and was able to do my excercises with no trouble, but again around 4.30 I felt cold again and that progressed rapidly to shivering. By 6pm the shaking wax uncontrollable and the pain in both groins was severe. My wife called the NHS out of hours service number and spoke to a representative and then a duty doctor called back she diagnosed a virus and told me to take paracetamol, which I was already taking. Again, with the hot water bottle treatment, the pain subsided after 30 mins leaving me with a temperature.
The next day I was find again although I could feel the groins where the pain had been. But again around the same time, I started feeling cold, shivering and the most uncontrollable body shakes and excrucia pain in both groins, which lasted again about 30 mins. I was in so much agony, I couldn't talk to the NHS duty doctor when wanted to speak to me. Speaking to my wife, the doctor thought that thus was much more than a virus and advised us to go immediately to the local NHS A&E  hospital, which is where I had my hip op. She also make me an appointment for when we would arrived.
I know this is a long story, so I'll cut to the chase, after a barrage of blood tests, chest X-Ray's, blood counts, blood pressures, they finally did a urine test had announced that it was a urine infection. I had a temporary catheter fitted on my first night after the op, and the doctor thought that it may have harboured an infection which has taken time to manifest itself. They kept me in overnight and gave me intravenous antibiotics and then sent my home this evening with oral antibiotics. Hopefully that will do the trick. I still have residual pain in both groins, which I hope will go away in time.
I thought the staff at the A&E where brilliant and I cannot speak highly enough if them. However, none of the many doctors I saw related the uncontrollable shakes and the ground pain to a urine infection.
So, if you ever encounter a similar problem, and believe me you will identify it if you have it, ensure that you mention to you medical team that it may be a urine infection and ask them to do a test.
If I'd gone to the hospital after the 2nd time, I probably wouldn't have the residual pain I have now.
i hope this saves someone the agony that I've been through.

"Hello everyone. This may sound a bit confusing because of the different dates and operations. I had posterior hip replacement on my right hip November 28th in 2016. November 21st 2017 I had left hip replacement. It has been 13 months for my right hip and 8 weeks since I had my left hip done. Both are posterior hip surgeries. I'm trying to get back into bed on my right hip that was replaced in 2016. But I'm still having discomfort. Just tried today for the first time to get into bed and take a nap. No luck. Just saw my surgeon had X-rays for my left hip which was done in 2017. He said everything looked fine. I didn't mention about my right hip because it just crossed my mind today when I attempted to take a nap. Does anyone else have this issue after almost 13 months of surgery and not being able to sleep kind of dull pain very achy just not comfortable I got up I didn't know what else to do but come back to the recliner. not sure if I should use ice before going to bed or heat. I'm sorry to go on and on but this is very disturbing since I work all day I'm 55 In a sitting position. thank you again I appreciate the feedback.

"I was doing fair on two Tramadol 50mg a day with just Paracetamol mid day.  I had an infection which exacerbated my overall pain and then returned to three a day.  Sometimes I do a coctail of paracetamol and enantyum with the Tramadol.  I have been taking the Tramadol for about six weeks now.  What do you guys think is an appropriate method of getting away from these meds, when, and with what progress.  My mo is to take meds prior to experiencing pain because if I wait for the pain, then I wait longer for the pain to disappear.  I will wait until I can sleep well on my sides before quitting the sleeping medication.  You would think that as an OLD hippy, I would want more than less but the opposite is true.

Happy 2018 as well, i hope you haveall had a great Christmas.
OK, so most want know what tomophobia is but I hope to understand my situation you could google it as google for a change does give a clear definition.
I had a major fall in June 2016 and fractured my pelvis (now fully healed luckily) and left hip, this wasn't healed at last MRI in June last year and is not completely in line.
I am still on crutches and I can only weight bear about 60% once I try to go past that amount I get quite bad spasms in the hip which can nearly knock me over, luckily I haven't fallen since because my right leg is strong and I'm told my balance is really good on the crutches, I am lucky that overall I'm not in too much pain on a continues basis only mainly when I do something stupid, I do exercise regularly and hydro every Friday, so my question is that if I find that there is that nothing can be done to improve my hip conservatively how can I get past this.
Please no nastiness, I have had more than enough from people who I mix with.

"Hi I'm about to have a hip replacement 15th Jan 2018.  I'm 56 and scared stiff and feel emotionally unprepared for it.  I was diagnosed about 10 years ago and until a few months ago managed with steroid injections.  Sadly they are not as effective anymore so consequently the op was offered very quickly and I've only had about a month to get my head around it and it still isn't!
My dilemma is sometimes I'm in pain, I tend to suffer with spasms in my thigh when at rest and think I need it!  The next day I could be not so bad .  My family say I've just got used to it and I don't realise how it has affected my life?
Guess I'm worried about my mobility after it has healed as at the moment mobility isnt too bad apart from the spasms and I do have limited range of movement in my leg .  I dance now as a hobby when I'm upto it and anxious i won't be able to dance again.   Quite frankly everything worries me, even down to sitting correctly and laying flat on my back sleeping !

"This time last year I was in hospital waiting to go down for my hip replacement. I was terrified. I realise now there was no need. Everything went so well. Now here I am 1 year on and I'm a new person. I'm off all medication, I'm back riding my horse better than before as I now sit straight and there's no pain and I'm back at work. To be honest most of the time I forget that I've got a new hip. It was interesting at the airport as obviously I set the alarms off. I told them that I had a hip replacement, I had to be scanned and was allowed through.
I hope my experiences over the last year will encourage those of you who are just starting out on this journey. Yes there are highs and lows, but in the end its well worth it to be pain free. The only time I do worry is when we get snow and ice. I'm terrified of falling and damaging my new hip. But how often do we get those conditions here in southern England.
Well here's to the start of my second pain free year.

Hello, 
I am 57 yo female. Had Avascular Necrosis in my right hip. THR on 10/24/16. PT for 5 months. I develop severe upper thigh pain when bending over not squatting as I don't have enough leg muscle strength to stand up. Experience pain when standing up and walking after sitting or laying. Why more pain in upper thigh after bending.? I know it has to do with the muscle, as PT recommends a massage ball and rolling leg over 36"" roller. I hear of great results from THR but not me. Sometimes I can stand for 8 hours with walking around but other times the pain is so bad I cry. Looking for suggestions, thoughts. I live in western MA so not sure of laws re: needles. All X-rays and MRI show nothing wrong. Thank you!!

"I had total hip replacement done in June of 2016 for the first hip (right leg), and again in Dec of 2016 for the second (left leg). I should also note that at the time I had osteoporosis related to a hormone deficiency, which has resolved somewhat through replacement therapy. I still have osteopenia. I'm a 50 year old male who was very active at the gym (5 days a week for 2+ hours each visit for weightlifting).
The first hip (right leg) went without issue, and within 6 weeks I was up and around and back at the gym. Mobility was still somewhat limited due to the remaining hip but I was in a good place.
The second hip (left leg) was a different story. The surgeon indicated that the plate initially sunk into the pelvis like it was made of warm ice cream. They had to do some last minute adjustments to place a larger plate and joint (successfully). This required some adjustments to the height of the implant but they were able to get the lengths to match even though the implant heights were slightly different. They also had an extremely difficult time getting the hip out of the socket during the replacement. The muscle had become so short and tight there was a lot of damage done to them during the process. Recovery was very slow. Over the next 6 months I would have 6 courses of PT, with most in-home but some out of the home as well. The home ones went fine, but the ones where I went to a facility did not. I have severe rib pain, which has gotten worse since the surgery. It makes laying on my sides or back excruciating. I've suffered from stress fractures to the spine, pelvis, tibias, femurs, and ankles. The therapists didn't seem to know how to deal with someone in my situation so I was forced to drag myself around on the table for various stretches and exercises. I looked like a fish trying to walk. All while in horrible pain. In the home I could at least use a bed for the PT and it was a bit easier on my ribs.
I finally asked for another in home PT session a few months ago (it's been a year since my last hip replacement on the left), and that one went very well. I regained all of my flexibility and range of motion (my replacements are ceramic with very big joints allowing me a wide range of motion). Unfortunately on the very last visit I seemed to pull a muscle in my right thigh and my PT sessions ended ended on the assumption it was temporary and it would heal. During all of this, I was experiencing severe pain in my knees (directly below the kneecap), in my arches of my feet, and in the quadriceps). Walking more than half a block or so would cause very sharp, extreme pain to my knees. If I continued walking beyond that, it would also start sending spikes of pain into the arches of my feet.
The knee and arch pain affects both legs. The quadricep pain affects only my right leg (the first hip replacement). My left hip replacement is largely without issue.
The surgeon has been telling me for a year that I must continue to stretch and the pain will resolve. All of the imaging shows perfect implants with no issues spotted with the hardware. I just had an hour+ MRI with contrast, and the only item of note was a new stress fracture above my right knee, approximately 2 inches above the kneecap. The same leg that hurts, but in the wrong location for the pain.
The problem I have now, is that when I do exercise, I get a 'tearing' sensation in my right qaud, and then my leg wants to buckle as if the muscle has been cut. Initially this pain started as a 'popping' when I was laying on my my back and I moved my leg left and right with the knee bent. It would pop in my hip, with my legs about 3-4 inches apart at the knees. After about 5 pops, a deep ache would start. This popping only happened with my knee bent at a specific angle. This popping later turned into this tearing sensation which I have today. This tearing pain has been ongoing now for about 4 months. This pain also prevents the leg from bearing weight once it happens. It resolves after 2-4 days.
I've started back to the gym doing very low weights and high reps. I am able to finish my workout this way, but I am typically unable to walk for 2-3 days after a workout session. When I can start walking again though, my motion is less painful and I have more strength.
At this point, outside of the fracture, which is painful but less so than the quad pain, my only options seems to be to take a lot of opioids and muscle relaxers, and just work through the pain. I take tramadol for pain, methocarbamol for a muscle relaxer, gabapentin for nerve pain, and a single Tylenol just to help as well. Without these I can't function much at all. I'm often forced to resort back to my walker around the house.
I don't know if I'm looking for general suggestions, or just venting. I've been through so much physically I don't know how much more I can tolerate. I've managed through a stroke, all of the fractures, a year in ankle braces, the THR, and now 2 years of using a walker and a cane and largely unable to walk any distance. It seems like I can walk a bit further, but doing so will usually put me on my back for the next 2 days recovering. I see people posting about gardening, or mowing lawns. None of these are possible for me at the moment. Its extremely frustrating not being able to DO things. Just going to the gym is a big help, and either the trip itself is having a positive effect, or the strength exercise is helping somewhat.
It's difficult for me to even bend over let alone get on my knees. Any stretching sets off the same pain. Working out seems to allow me to avoid it if I'm careful but I often still end up unable to walk due to pain. I'm only doing 5 different exercises or so on the legs (leg press, calf extension, lower back extension, hip abduction, and leg extension. Each of these has very low weights (ranging in the 10-30 pound range). I'm not overly concerned about the rip pain, the knee pain, or the arch pain. Those didn't exist before the surgery and I'm hoping they are due to inactivity and having to learn to walk again with my weight in a slightly different place on my pelvis.
The thigh pain though is bad. It prevents me from working or even walking much for days at a time. The MRI was clean though. The doc still insists it's just tight muscles. It feels like it's ripped open to me.

"I am now 67 years old, have had discomfort and some pain from OA since I was 50 and have been taking Meloxocam for about 4 years now. About 2 years ago I started to walk with a limp from my left hip which became painful and now also my right one has very quickly become more painful. My surgeon indicated that he thought it was still too soon for the operation, though he could do it should wish.
My dilemma is the following:- I have been extremely active all my life am retired and live for a sport that involves walking/climbing up and down a mountain side. I can still do it, a bit slowly and with some discomfort, not as often as I did, but if the deterioration continues at the rate it has done the past year, then I somehow predict that in a year or two, I will no longer manage.
If I were prepared to stop my hobby now, I would probably continue the way I am for some time but that will be a very reluctant lifestyle change.  So if I have the op now, it will be only to enable me to continue with my hobby, but will I be able to? . And then, after a year my knees may probably need attention?
With new hips, will I be able to walk safely on mountain sides, where I have to lift my legs up high and lever myself to step up on ledges, walk on uneven ground, over boulders and scramble upor down a slope? My feeling is that this is tempting a possible dislocation of the hip with very serious consequences.
My friends who I know have had knee and hip surgery all say have the operation sooner rather than later and I believe that, if the objective is to simply do the normal things of life, without pain.
I also clearly understand that many of these questions don't have definitive simple clear answers, but perhaps those on this forum who have been there have an opinion that can guide me.
Thanks

"I am only about a month out of THR.  I was pushing myself back on a chair a few nights ago and felt a sudden sharp upper thigh pain.  That night the on call MD was here in my flat today that it looked like I had an infection.  His nurse gave me an injection and he wrote me a script for Cipro for 10 days.  The pain continues when I get in and out of bed, sometimes intense, very sharp.  I have an impending appointment with my surgeon in a couple of weeks anyway.  Funny thing is that I was walking a mile or so a day but right now am restricting myself to bed rest.  Like normal, I worry.  Any ideas?

"I have had an antibiotic cement spacer in my left hip for 8 months. Aspirated on November 27th. 6 weeks after finishing iv antibiotics. There was fluid but it was a small amount and it was negative for infection. Surgery was scheduled for 1/17/18. This past week my hip pain increased. I was hoping it was from a fall I took on December 30th. Today on 1/8/18 they aspirated again. There was 21cc of red tint fluid. It was very painful and slow me just moving around the table for the procedure. I'll have the initial results hopefully later tonight or tomorow morning. I'm praying that it's pain from the fall. But it feels all to similar I'm worried. I was so close only 9 days to get the better joint back. I don't know if I can go through another spacer. This will b the sixth surgery on my left hip.  No drug use or anything that would definitely cause An infection. Is it possible they leFt the spacer In to long. I imagine the antibiotics on cement run out and the spacer has been terribly painful this whole time. Could the trauma from that bring infection?

"Hi,
I've been writing about my progress on a weekly progress and here we are already 3 weeks post op. I should say that I was strong before the op with swimming and the gym and my BMI is about 25 so not too heavy.
At the end of the week 3 I'm finding I can swing my leg in and out of bed without too much thought and am walking around the house without aid apart from later in the evening after Ive done my daily walk and then I may use a crutch. Also first thing in the morning I am a little stiff for 5 mins and then it eases off. As far as walking, I was doing 3/4 mile walks daily at the start of the week with two crutches and ending up doing a 11/2 mile walk around a stately home yesterday with a rest and coffee in between.
I saw the physio on Wednesday and she said I was doing good and that I can walk with one crutch outside and as long as there was no pain walk as far as you want. She also said that restrictions had been reduced on things like sleepinig on your back for six weeks and said it was ok to sleep on any side as long as it was comfortable. I have been sleeping on my non op side for well over a week, with pillow, and what a blessing that has been. Since Wednesday I've managed to lie on my op side and whilst not painful I'm only able to lie for about 30 mins before I need to roll over to status quo. I'm sure before next week I may be sleeping on the op side.
Since Wednesday I've been walking with one crutch and two crutches on alternate days after taking on board what people have suggested on here about maintaining a good gait before  going 'freestyle' without crutches.
I must say that the improvement on a weekly basis is quite remarkable, at end of week one I said that I was not looking forward to my other hip being done anytime soon but now the thought is not so daunting.
Happy xmas hippies and good luck to everyone.

"I have been fussing with hip pain for 3 years.  Sometimes the pain is very prohibitive and other times, it can be mild-moderate.  As soon as I think I can continue to live with this awhile, I will enter a bad phase and think, ""no way!"".  I have labreal fraying and some degeneration.  I am not bone on bone. I have gathered from doctors that my hip MRI/xrays don't necessarily point to replacement at this time.  I also have some lumbar facet joint arthritis which I do believe is impacting my hip pain as it's on the same side.  I've had 2 lumbar ablations, 2 interarticular hip injections, bursa and muscle injections.  I can't tolerate the higher powered NSAIDS; I occasionally use hydrocodone but only when I'm really hurting.  I often need Ambien to sleep.  Certain floor exercises & stretches are fine; swimming made it worse.  Walking is mostly good except for stiffness and some ""give out"" after I stand up.  I can climb stairs.  Sitting is generally pretty miserable unless in certain recliners.  Driving is a pain. Working in the yard, one of my favorite pastimes, is pretty miserable.  Housework always creates pain (lol).  So, all that said to ask, is it time for replacement?  I don't want to be a wimp, but I'd really like to do things without pain. At the same time, I do not want to invite trouble...  Thoughts??

"Hi! I have been quite busy the last few months since I last posted nothing overly interesting just life lol. Anyway I have been working part time at a coffee shop for almost two months now since disability really barely pays the basics and my laptop is beginning to die and so forth. 
The pain is sheer hell when I am at home I can barely move/walk. Good thing I live with my mom we split the chores and she does my laundry since I have never been able to get down the narrow basement stairs since we lived here. I am hoping this eases up soon, but at almost two months I am beginning to wonder.
I also noticed that my real hip is more painful now I suppose with the extreme cold and extra work the arthritis has decided to act up. Which sucks since I use that side to support myself more. 
Now onto my replaced hip, I don稚 like anything touching that side or too much pressure. I can稚 even lie on that side not quite painful but really uncomfortable but it has been like this since day one. I just noticed yesterday as I was getting dressed that I have some bruises on my hip/upper leg which is weird because like I said I don稚 like anything touching it. And if a hit it I would remember something like that. Part of me wonders if it is due to working my muscles more and not writing it off as anything to do with the hip yet.
But just two days ago something weird happened. Just to let everyone know that I have slightly been pushing myself more than normal by also babysitting my sister痴 three little ones from 5am to 11am than going to work at 3:30 to 10pm - only because she didn稚 have a sitter and it was only for the past four days. Well two days ago about ten minutes after I got there I started to feel a little sick and I was like great now I am coming down with something. And boy was I sick but this is the kicker I only got physically ill after I had to get up. Sitting down, especially in the recliner I was fine still didn稚 feel the greatest but no where nearing vomiting. For example I got up to get the kids their breakfast and juice than have to make a bee line for the bathroom.
The worst was when I had to actually leave the house to come home I got sick on the drive. I live literally four blocks from their house and it is a three minute drive and the bumpy roads from the snow made me vomit. When I got home I quickly cleaned myself up and crawled in bed (I had my mom call my work to say I couldn稚 make it in at 7 am so someone could take over my shift). After sleeping for half an hour I got sick one last time. Here I was expecting to be sick for a day or two and it stopped after a few hours mind you I wasn稚 moving unless I absolutely had to at this point. So that was weird and another thing was my fake hip was cold the rest of me was warm but I even let my mom touch the hip and she threw extra blankets on me. And it was around this time I noticed the bruises. 
I am am going to drop my hours to 20 a week soon and hoping that will help a bit. But has anyone else experienced something similar? And I think my hip is about ten years old. I am considering calling my family doctor on Monday since I don稚 want to bug my surgeon but at the same time when I saw my family doctor in October he said that if I have any issues with the hip go to Toronto that is where my surgeon is. Thanks for reading my rambling post.

Until yesterday, I had no sense that I had an artificial hip but then during the day I became aware that there was something in there and I could feel, not pain, but an ache when I walked. I had cut down on the painkillers and I had been spending quite a bit of time standing up doing various little jobs. The feeling is still there today. Is this quite normal?

"Hi All,
I am a bit over 16 weeks on my posterior THR.  My hip has been hurting for the past 2 weeks, off and on.  I thought I dislocated the THR.  Well, I went to the surgeon for my post-op visit.  The x-rays showed no damage at all (whew)!!  I questioned him on several things. First, there was a stiffness, a little bit numb feeling in both my feet.  I felt this after the initial THR.  However, he said this would go away in time.  Now he told me to see a neurologist.   Secondly, I gave pain occasionally in my knee, the same side as my THR.  He suggested  I treat it with one tab if Meloxicam followed by a couple of Tylenol.  If it doesn稚 go away, I should come backfor a shot of cortisone.  The pain on my THR should go away by taking the meds.  So that is the story.  My next appointment is in 6 months ( unless I have the cortisone shot in my knee).
Regards,
Steve

"About 8 weeks Post-Op Total hip replacement - Anterior approach, right hip. I am a 50-year-old women and weigh 114 pounds and am and have been fairly active most of my life.)
I am experiencing an INTENSE pain in my groin area - down to my inside knee and front thigh, on the new right side.
It is a sharp pain - ONLY when i stand up after sitting. The pain lasts only about 10-30 seconds when i first try to put weight on the leg. The pain goes away after a few steps, BUT OH those few steps are excruciating. I don't have any pain while sitting, walking, bike riding, stretchingjust the moment when i get up from the sitting position and try to apply weight.   
I am still in PhysicalTherpy and have stopped all physical stressful hip exercises. The therapist only does deep muscle massages trying to release some muscle somewhere deep in my groin/thigh area, but it is just not getting any better  
My Doctor took X-Rays and said the appliance looks fine - now he is talking about an x-ray guided Cortisone shot, which I am not very happy about.
Has ANYONE else experienced any pain like this ?
Should I insist on a MRI ?
Has anyone had one of these Cortisone shots and if so how painful is it,  and is it risky to surrounding nerves.
Any thoughts or experiences to be shared would be appreciated?

My left hip THR was done 2012, so I had some perspective. Do NOT  allow anyone to do an anterior approach- results are coming in with no advantage and more concerns. I had a seroma upon awakening from 7/3 surgery (did you know seroma increase risk of infection?) and had an initial debridement under general anesthesia 8/5. 4 weeks of IV antibiotics, still having pain pain pain. Saw a Rheumatologist out of desperation- MRI/ 2 arthrocentesis- the first negative ( nondiagnostic!!!) and the second definite infection- staph aureus, a simple skin bacteria (ha!!) every Ortho place I called would refer me back to the original surgeon and would not even SEE me- Mayo and NY Surgical along with local Med center/school. University of Nebraska- a CONSULT in mid March, no promise on surgery date.

"I am 5 weeks post op posterior and phoned hospital yesterday to try and book the usual 6 week check up in outpatients. I was gobsmacked. It would appear that the 菟owers that be/bookings clerks have been trying for a long time to get proper follow up appointments in place but have been unable to do so. 
My young surgeon was new to the hospital and I was very pleased to get onto his new list early and pleased with the way my op went. The staff like him and sum him up as being 砺ery ambitious. He trained at Stanmore and told me on day one there were no restrictions on my bending. He had fitted me in on his new patient list on a Saturday,early,so I was very pleased about that being in agony for almost a year, and staff told me he was working  really hard as he was trying to get all the backlog operated on. 
However it appears that there are no outpatient appointments in place. I was given a first outpatient appointment in March 2018 and my operation was November 2017. I had never heard of first outpatient appointments being difficult to set up. The booking clerk said there had been requests to get this sorted but as yet the surgeon didn稚 have the necessary time slots for many of these. I have now been given one a the end of January but it痴 still 9 weeks post op. Has anyone else had a long wait for their first outpatient appointment following a THR?

"Hi, all, and Happy New Year! I'm now moving into my 12th month after anterior THR. As I have posted before, I still have constant pain. There is a persistent ache deep in the hip joint, and more acute pain in the front, side, and back of my thigh, from the top edge of my pelvis down to the knee, and up my entire buttock. The pain is not always intense, but can be so in any location when moving my hip and leg in various ways.
So my question to you hippies is whether this type of pain could be caused by either an infection or by metal allergy?
I have had multiple x-rays, a CT scan, a nuclear med bone scan, and an EMG test. With both nerve and soft tissue damage ruled out, and a ""perfect"" prosthesis, the only 2 causes left are allergy and infection.
I have an appointment on Jan 2 with a pain management specialist, and I have consulted with 2 different and new (to me) physiotherapists in the last week or so. But in addition to management and exercises, I want to find a CAUSE and see if it can be corrected. My formerly active life has been pretty well ruined by this.
For any of you who have experienced either infection or allergy, do these symptoms sound like yours? Is one or the other of these a likely or even possible cause of my ongoing pain?
Thanks and a great 2018 to everyone!

I got a temporary Christmas job to see how I got on, no lifting but I was on my feet the whole time doing between 6 and 8 hour shifts 4/5 days a week, as the weeks went on I noticed increasing pain in my pelvis and had to stop work at the end of week four ( it was a six week contract) because I was in severe pain.
I am so upset all I want to do is go back to work and be normal, my op was in June, I don't know if my expectations are to high or if I need to see my GP for this, I still have inflammation in these joints but it has calmed down a bit since I stopped work, however I still need pain killers.
I have Hip Dysplasia in my right hip that currently doesn't hurt but the hip is 'clicky' and my left hip is the replacement which was for dysplasia that had become painful and was wearing away my cartilage.

"Hi 
feeling desperate . I have a hip revision in April I was slow to get going but finally after 7 months went back to part time work. Then had a few very busy weekends , slept in parents settee due to their illness. Started awful pain . Long story cut short I thought it was sciatica , but had X-ray via GP , total shock told screws fractured and plate moved in my THR . I have not got a clue what this means.  Original surgeon seeing me in new year, but the pain is getting worse daily. Trying to get up from sitting or trying to sit causes pain like I have never had, even with taking morphine. 
Any my suggestions or helpful clues or anything as I can't seem to find out what this all means for me. 
Thank you you all Crisps

"I have just come across an interesting article on the BBC news website ""My restless legs were like bees biting under my skin""
It affects up to one in 20 adults, and can cause severe sleep deprivation.
At its worst, you may survive on only a few hours' sleep at night, sometimes even less.
Restless Leg Syndrome can be caused by iron deficiency and pregnancy - and it's usually easy to treat.  For most people, simply avoiding caffeine, alcohol and certain medications can be enough, and gentle exercise - stretching or leg massage can help - but for some, drugs are necessary.
It is actually very common in people who've had their sleep disrupted for many years, in that sleep is a learnt habit.  The dread of the night ahead and the constant disruption of sleep can persist.  Sometimes people needed sleep retraining - relearning that bed equals sleep rather than the torture of a difficult night ahead.
Listening to music or audio books (my favourite method) can help the brain to relax and bring on sleep. What you're doing essentially is you're distracting yourself.  By thinking about the story or music you're listening to, you're no longer thinking about the process of going to sleep and therefore your brain switches into passive mode and then sleep happens upon you as if by accident.

"Back again.  I got a second opinion when my original surgeon suggested a metal on metal.  I went for another opinion and am scheduled for Feb for a ceramic, poly one. This Doctor has suggested I might need an inferior Vena cava filter before I have a hip replacement because I has a DVT in that leg post ankle surgery a few years ago.  I am scheduled for an evaluation with the vascular doctor.  Question -has anyone else experienced this? Did you have a permanent or removable one?  Was it inserted on the day of your hip surgery or before? How long a recovery before the hip surgery?  Anything I should know before I sign up for this too?  Thank everyone in advance. You are all such a valuable source of information and comfort.  Merry Christmas and happy Holidays.

"I posted on here a short while ago about my operated foot turning inwards and thanks to positive replies I got back I stopped being concerned. However, although I'm still only 4 weeks post op, I've been reading that although some people find that their foot turns inwards due to temporary muscle weakness a surgeon might deliberately turn the prosthesis slightly in the bone to improve stability and avoid it dislocating. The more I look at my operated somewhat bowed leg/twisted foot, the more inclined I am to think this may well be what my surgeon decided to do.  I chose to have no sedation during my THR so i could ask questions about the procedure and I definitely remember my surgeon saying something about it being ""a bit of a challenge"" getting the prosthesis to sit inside the femur properly. My first outpatient appointment wont be for some yet so I'm unable to ask about this. I'm not unduly worried because if this is what he chose to do then it was for my benefit but I'm posting on here about this to ask if anyone else knows they had their prosthesis deliberately turned during the op. Thanks.

"Hello,
Due to developing traumatic avascular necrosis after a femoral neck fracture, I received a total hip replacement in 2002, when I was 23 years old. Anterior, titanium/ plastic. Everything has been great for the past 15 years, and I have enjoyed a very normal and active lifestyle (while taking care not to engage in too much high impact activity).  
Over the past couple of months, I've begun to feel something in the area of my hip replacement, and now there is a constant, low level pain that increases after activity or stretching.  
I am a graduate student and a working artist and have Medicaid.  I was able to see a PCP. They took ex-rays and sent them to the local orthopedic clinic that accepts Medicaid.  The Ortho surgeon looked at my ex-rays and claims that there is nothing noticably wrong with my hip - which means they won't see me at all until their next available appointment- August 30, 2018.  
I'm terrified.  I'm aware that revision surgeries are often more problematic than initial surgeries, but even though I've sorted through medical research articles, I'm not exactly sure why.  I don't know if I am suffering from osteolysis, I really don't know anything and I can't get even a conversation with an orthopedic physician.  This is why I've come to this forum.  If anyone has insight into any of my questions, I would be so grateful for your help.
1. What are the risks I should be aware of with THR revision surgery?
2. What are the signs that a THR revision surgery is needed?
3. *My Biggest, Scariest Question*: Assuming I need a revision surgery, are the chances of a successful surgery decreased the longer I wait?  If I continue to walk on this painful hip until the Dr will see me in August, am I lowering the chances that I will have a successful revision? 
4. Do you think there could be another reason to explain my pain?(the Dr said my ex-rays don't indicate a problem)
5. Should I attempt to get more specific imaging done (MRI, bone scan)?  I don't know if an ex-ray would even show osteolysis or other things that could be potentially causing my hip replacement to fail. 
6. Does anyone know of research that I can be a part of?  Young patient needing a revision?
Please help if you can.
Thank you so much and I wish everyone the best.

"I had a RTHR (posterior) almost a year ago. I had been suffering with pain in my right leg and buttocks for over 4 years.
I just wanted to write on the recovery timelines that I experienced particularly in the first three months.
1) Discharged from hospital- 48 hours using a walker 
2) Walking with crutches- started 3 or 4 days after surgery
3) Stopped taking prescription painkillers(Tylenol3) - within 1-2 days after release and then only took Extra strength Tylenol thereafter...initially no more than 3000mg per day and then tapered down after a few weeks to maybe 1000-1500 mg per day
4) Time to driving- 4 weeks.  All the printed information says to not drive until you have received clearance from your surgeon usually around 6 week mark. But I知 single and hated to rely on friends to help with grocery shopping etc for any longer than was necessary. No issues with response time to break etc.
5) Time to walking without crutches- 10 weeks. My physio did not want me to walk without crutches until I could walk without a limp so I used a single crutch for several weeks.
6) First round of golf -14 weeks...used a cart though. 
7) First round of golf walking- 4 months. 
Other thoughts...
Worst part of rehab was inability to sleep for probably first 6 weeks. I知 a side sleeper and wasn稚 given clearance to sleep on incision for about 6 weeks.  I took the odd sleeping pill but generally powered through the insomnia getting about 3 hours of sleep a night,
Rehab exercises- followed the prescribed exercises to a letter. Very important. Even today almost a year out I go to gym three days a week minimum to ride a stationary bike and to do some light weights to strengthen my hip. I go for one long walk a week of one hour(approximately 6 km or 4 miles). My hip (and frame of mind ) is  better than it痴 been  in several years.
So my advice to anyone who is having a THR soon or is still rehabilitating.. the first 12 weeks are the toughest but stay with it, keep a positive frame of mind and when you feel down with the slowness of the recovery, remember better days are ahead!
All the best,
Pat

"Hi,
 My aunty had bilateral hip replacements for Afi joint replacement .  Short stem hip replacements were done. She enjoys not only pain relief but very good function like floor sitting. Afi joint replacement is a common condition among young patients which may need hip replacements.  Short stem hip replacements with durable materials can last very long, reducing the need for a re do operation later on. If you need a hip replacement, visit website, www.afijointreplacement.comShort stem hip replacement has several advantages when compared to total hip replacement. As it is anchored in the top part of the thigh bone, less penetration into the shaft avoids thigh pain. Bone retention allows for a total hip replacement later on instead of a revision hip replacement. A variety of bearing materials can be used.

"First day home after LTHR and things progressing well except with the problem of passing urine, in fact, passing anything. It occurred to me that in the age of medical advances in nearly all fields, the only way of encouraging urine to flow is to stick a plastic tube up the urethra. I admit, it did find something for the nurse to do doing the night, but I would have thought someone could have come up with something more sophisticated by now. They have a machine that can tell you how much fluid is in the bladder - I already knew, it was full- but they don't have one to get it out. Nobel prize awaiting for someone.

"I had THR surgery in August on my left hip. I had a pretty easy recovery and last month I had a hip injection in my right hip to keep me going for a few months. I am planning for the right hip replacement in March. So at the three month stage, after the hip injection, I was thrilled to be pretty much pain free. Walking the dogs became a pleasure again instead of a chore. Now at four months, my left thigh muscles are causing pain and stiffness. Could this be caused by possible leg length discrepancy? Would that condition normally take this long to cause pain? To add to my discomfort, I have had to stop all pain medication because I'm having eye surgery tomorrow. I can't wait to get back on my Aleve!
Does anyone have any suggestions as to what could be causing this new pain and what I can do to reduce it? Heat, ice, more exercise, less exercise, massage?

Following second thr in may I have been working hard at regaining strength and mobility with lots of swimming, cycling and adductor exercises but still not 100% happy. The reason for this post is aimed at UK users who probably get signed off by the physio after just a few visits. I decided to get a six months MOT with a private physio to check my progress, I was amazed to find that my glutes (bum) and hamstrings were still very weak despite always doing the recommended recovery exercises . I am now doing squats and lunges to improve this and can already feel my mobility improving.

For example, I知 doing my stretches to my left hip that I just had a THR on and I put  total weight on the right leg. When I知 done and take the weight off the right leg I feel as if my right joint goes back into place. It痴 an uncomfortable feeling. Maybe it痴 weak muscles that I haven稚 used in a long time and they are readjusting themselves after the weight I put on them. Maybe I haven稚 completely used the muscles on the right after that THR  as I was dealing with the pain on my left.  And I never completely strengthened those muscles.

"So I saw my surgeon yesterday. I知 4 months post hip revision surgery; importantly the revision included a psoas release. I asked my surgeon explicitly, did he completely cut the psoas; his answer was yes. My next question was will it repair and be as strong as my other hip. Yes it will he said. He said I will continue to see improvements & wants to see me at the 12 month mark.
He said I am doing well. 
I told him my leg is still feeling heavy & he said that will improve. 
I can walk well & clock up a minimum of 10000 steps on my Fitbit & quite often hit the 20000 mark. I am doing lots of strength work & he said to continue with that. 
I know I致e read on this forum that there are concerns regarding a full psoas release ie complete cut of the psoas. I am optimistic my surgeon is correct & that the psoas will repair in time. He has a great reputation  in Sydney; Australia so will remain hopeful.

" I致e had three arthroscopic surgeries on my right hip since July 2015.  My original diagnosis was bilateral quad tears, bilateral hamstring tears, bilateral bursitis, bilateral impingement and bilateral labrum tears. On November 29 of this year, I had total hip replacement. I have a huge tolerance for pain, which unfortunately, led to me ultimately needing THR.   With all of those injuries, I still ran the Boston Marathon in April 2015 and hiked the Grand Canyon rim to rim to rim in May 2015. Then my first surgery.  My question for anybody out there is, I壇 be curious to hear what everybody is doing this soon after surgery. Obviously, like many of you, I was up and walking the day of surgery. I致e been walking daily since, however in the first few days, or week, my walking was not very much at all.  By the ninth day, I had progressed to a total of about 1 1/2 to 2 hours of walking throughout an entire day  but have now spent much more time upright and ambulatory throughout the entire portion of the day.   I致e done limited exercises as a relates to upper body, mainly just trying to maintain some muscle cemetery and upper body strength. I致e done nothing specific to isolate any lower body exercises outside of walking.  From the day of surgery to present, the pain and swelling from the surgery have been far worse than I could致e ever imagined.  For the record, my surgery was not a result of bone on bone nor did I have arthritis. I had many other factors going on with the hip and soft tissue around the hip -  my surgical teams felt that replacement was the best answer.  My thigh and hip both feel so extremely tight and sore. Like many THR patients out there, I swear at times I can feel the implant, however, I know it is the muscles and nerves  I am feeling. The thigh pain is ridiculous. Last night throughout the night I got up probably three or four times to use the restroom. I did not use crutches and, while tender, I did not feel like I was overdoing anything. This morning when I woke up, my hip was so tight and so sore and the feeling of impingement has just been crazy all day.  I just don稚 know if I致e been on my feet too long throughout the days or if I致e been walking too much or if I should have never attempted to not use the crutches. I apologize that this post is all over the place as far as my detailed explanation, but I知 hoping to get some insight from others out there who may be feeling some of the same things or who are questioning whether not they are overdoing it. I am a 54-year-old fit woman who by trade is a personal trainer and fitness instructor. I am a runner and a hiker. Well, pre-injuries I did those things. I will again, in time!!

"Hi Ive got my thp on 29th Dec it will be posterior and un-cemented.
I spoke to the occupational therapist and she has said I will be partial weight bearing on crutches. She said I wont be able to shower for 6 weeks, even though ive got a walk in cubicle shower. I can handle the non-shower part just about but how do people wash their hair?

"I am now almost 11 months post surgery, THR, anterior approach on right hip. As many of you know, I have been miserable, in pain 24/7, wishing I never had the surgery. Still need a cane, limp, can't move around in bed, put boots on, can't climb stairs, etc. Despite doing all my physio, exercising on my own, adhering exactly to all instructions, my recovery has been slow and terrible from day 1, including 2 significant downturns, at 6 months and again at 9 months.
I sought out a second opinion and had both a CT scan and a bone scan. (My original surgeon only did x-rays and said all was fine.) Neither showed anything wrong.
So I asked if they had definitively ruled out 4 things: metal allergy, infection, soft tissue damage, and nerve damage. Answer was no to all except soft tissue damage, which they said was ruled out by the CT and bone scans. So I started with least invasive testing, which is EMG for nerve damage, to start ruling out the other 3 issues.
Now, lo and behold, in the last week, it has started feeling better! Still hurts, but not as intensely or as pervasively, and I have a bit more freedom of movement. Could I have somehow just turned a corner? Seems odd to me after nearly a year of so little progress and setbacks, and I dont know if I should trust it.
But my dilemma is now this: I have an appointment on Monday for the EMG testing, and one coming up later for a pain management specialist. Now I don't know if I need to go ahead with either of these, or if I am just healing properly at long last. In my shoes, would you go ahead with these next steps, or just be happy about the improvement?
I'm in the US and on Medicare, so it won't cost me anything, but I don't want to waste time and resources for nothing. But I also need to know if I can go ahead with plans for hiking trips and other types of relatively physical travel. I would hate to be in Macchu Pichu or someplace and have another setback. (Not that I am quite ready to do that anyway, as I am far from pain free!)
Any thoughts?
Sorry for repeating so much of my story, but I don't know how to go back to my earlier posts.

"Hi All,
Just an update of my progress and some observations. I had posterior TRHR uncemented with general anesthesia 7 days ago.  Because I have an enlarged prostate BPH the anesthesist catheterised me which caused problems because when it was removed my kidneys for some reason stopped producing urine. Whilst I had the catheter I was producing lots of urine but afterwards the bladder didnt seem to be able to fill. Things started working ok within 8 hours but it was a bit of a scare and delayed me going home on the second day. Things are ok in that department now but older men with BPH should look at this further before their op. Once home on the third day I developed prickly heat which is proving to be difficult to shift because up until last night I had to lay on my back where I have the prickly heat which just irritates the area more. I'm washing 4 times a day and applying 1% cortisone creme and taking anti histamine and am seeing the doctor this Wednesday for a check up here. I read in a few places that it was ok to sleep on the un operated leg so gingerly tried it last night and am pleased to say it is both comfortable and stops the prickly heat getting too hot and itchy.
Normal recovery is going well, I think, have been doing all set exercises and for the last two days done 100 and 200 mtrs outside with two crutches. I can do this comfortably but am not wanting to overdo things so early on. I did tell myself that getting to the first week milestone would be good and I would have a lot less pain especially getting in and out of bed but thats not the case. It's just a slow process letting things heal naturally, so I'm now telling myself that 'after two weeks' I should be noticeable better. We will see. I did try  to go painkiller free on the 4th day but gave that notion up quite quickly as the pain I get from changing position, especially in and out of bed is too much. So, since then, Ive been taking 1 tramadol 3 or 4 times a day.
I just think we have to accept that hip replacement is not as pain free or as quick recuperating operation.
I have  my wound checked this Wednesday and hope that will be ok, it feels ok. I'm looking forward to that as it gets me out of the house and if I'm feeling comfortable will take my partner for a well deserved posh coffee

"Hi all, any of you feel your hip, buttocks and thigh muscles tense up?
I知 a very tense person but I can tell my muscles would tense up prior to surgery in a way to protect myself from falling or to get around walking with the joint pain. 
Now I feel my muscles tense up after my THR I think to protect my leg from further hurt or injury. Plus to hold myself better while walking. 
I think that why my right hip (which I had THR a yr ago on) has gotten a bit painful. I知 sure I知 using the right leg to compensate for my recent THR on my left. 
I finally took a pain pill yesterday to walk more comfortably and I noticed how relaxed those muscles were. 
How Can I relax those muscles without meds? 
It痴 been too long walking around tensed up like that and my body I知 sure is used to it. I think I would feel less uncomfortable with this current THR if it weren稚 for that.

"I am not a negative person. In fact I had virwed my forthcoming operation with excitement. But now, being reduced to writing this post at 3 in the morning after yet another pain filled night with yet more new symptoms , there is now no light whatsoever at the end of an unending tunnel. This is roughly last nights pattern:
Went to a nicely supported bed at 9pm having taken co codamol, 5mg diazepam, zopiclone and tonic water ( for twitching leg).  Severe pain in buttock of operated leg began immediately. Up again to massage buttock. Twitching began in operated leg as soon as I lay back down. I had already taken diazepam so drank tonic water. Lay down, severe pain in buttock still plus new stabbing pain across top of toes of operated leg. 10pm Got up and relocated from bed to recliner in lounge. Twitching again in operated leg plus buttock pain plus that new persistent pain across my toes of operated leg. Sat up in recliner for a change of position and lower back/buttock pain started again. Got up to massage, lay back down, stabbing pain across toes again plus that twitching/jumping of operated leg. Left recliner, went back to bedroom, used Biofreeze on buttock/lower back.  Slept for an hour then awoken with same scenario.

They told me not to take ibuprofen as it ""thins your blood"", however they have me on 1 325 mg aspirin twice a day for that same purpose! Tylenol does nothing for me and I can find no compelling evidence online for NOT taking ibuprofen . Also, the swelling in my hip has decreased quite a bit since taking the ibuprofen (a total of 5 in the last 19 hours).

"Hi fglks.
Just past the 3 week anniversary of my left posterior THR and I think I've been pretty lucky when reviewing some of the threads on this forum. Had exemplary pre and post op care with good pain med support and also the supply of equipment for my home environment by the UK Red Cross on a free loan basis.
Have had few problems apart from some initial discomfort, a bit of ankle swelling on the operated leg and lack of sleep during the first few days after discharge. I am continuing with the prescribed exercises and can now complete them mostly with no issues. However I still struggle a little with the abduction exercise (swinging operated leg out to the left for 5secs repeated 10 times) and also the weight bearing exercise where you transfer weight from the good leg to the operated leg over 10 reps. With both these I still get some discomfort in my thigh and joint area.
I am managing to get about well though with two crutches and have been out walking when the weather permits (snowing here today in UK so definitely staying indoors). 
My question is about how long I should expect to rely on two crutches before progressing to maybe one crutch or a walking stick/cane and then eventually walking without any support.
I don't want to push too early and have some sort of relapse but equally I don't want to end up relying too much on walking aids

I had my first three on left leg in march 2017 and have just had my right one replaced (6 days ago). I had a general anaesthetic with femoral nerve block for pain relief during the op as I can't have a spinal one due to spinal damage. Unfortunately the block didn't take on the right side this time so have had very high pain levels.
The problem I have is that the left thigh IS completely numb even though there was only a right femoral nerve block attempted . I am getting erratic and wide spread electrocution type zapping in left thigh when I move funny and otherwise it's just numbness. Right leg has no numbness and never has
Has anyone suffered with this or have any idea what's happening?

"Such a shock yesterday evening when I took my dog out! I have only started walking without a stick this week, partly because it is such a nuisance at work, and because I feel it's time to move on. So I was looking forward to taking my dog out as I'm also working on increasing my activity. All the pavements are tarmac where we live, they were all twinkly and sparkly. Oh dear, I could hardly stay upright even with good soled shoes. It made me extremely anxious that I would fall, something I wouldn't even have worried about last winter. And the effort of trying to stay upright was a real challenge for the muscles in the side of my hip and front of the thigh. To top it all, the dog got her foot stuck in a drain and I had to pull her out! Needless to say we went for our walk today in daylight when the ice had melted a bit and I could see better. Life as a hippie is clearly challenging in ways more than just having the op!

"I've been lurking on this wonderful forum for awhile, and have decided to share my problem. I am impressed with the compassion and knowledge shown here! I am 67 and had a right THR 22 weeks ago. Had bone-on-bone OA, and could walk without a limp despite the pain, was very active. Recovery has been mostly uneventful, except that I still can't walk unaided without pain and a bad limp. I am in the U.S. with excellent insurance, so can see my surgeon and any other doctor whenever I want. I had 22 sessions of physical therapy, and I did all they asked of me.
Surgeon did more x-rays and a thorough physical exam and doesn't think that the prosthesis is loose, says everything looks fine. So I am seeing a phsyiatrist (doctor of physical medicine), and had a steroid/anesthetic injection in my sacroiliac joint a week ago to see if that would help. No change. Still have nasty pain in right thigh/hip area, and complete inability to put all my weight on the surgical leg. Leg just gives out on me when I try to balance on it alone. Going back to doc in 2 weeks, and we will try other treatments/scans to try to figure out the problem.
I get around very well with a crutch outside the house and a rollator walker in the house, although I fatigue quickly. Don't have pain while sitting down or just standing on both feet. I am discouraged.
Has anyone had this kind of situation? I tried to search for similar threads. Any comments or links to other threads would be appreciated.

"5 weeks ago I had a total hip replacement which was my second. I had a nerve block for the op and sedation which went well. About 6 hrs after the op the physio came round and suggested a very short walk round the ward. I said yes, had a short walk with not to much pain and got back into bed. About 3 hrs after the walk I started to get bad pain in my hip and knee which rapidly got worse. I called the nurse and was given some extra pain relief. A short while later the pain got so bad It was off the scale I was crying and writhing on the bed. Called the nurse again and she then said she would put a call out for a doc. After what seemed a long wait for the doc and me screaming out loud with pain he arrived. I was given a shot of morphine I believe in the mouth. Again it did not stop the pain and I called nurse again. At this point pain was so bad I was trying to push my furniture over by bedside in sheer frustration at the pain levels. I was screaming and shouting out loud for help. I must say at this point I was on my own in a ward. Called nurse again and doc was called again. After what seemed a long wait he came and a morphine pump was ordered. So I had to wait for that and all the time I was screaming and shouting with pain off the scale. The pump finally came and I had 2mls of morphine every 2 mins with a nurse in attendance. It took about 7 shots to even take the edge off the pain and in all I had about 45 mls of morphine to reduce the pain to a manageable level. The surgeon who I spoke to the next day said it could have been bleeding after the op, as I was feeling better I did not push the incident further he also mentioned politely about how women go through a lot of pain at childbirth but it does not stop them having more children. A person I spoke to later who was in a side ward with visitors was mortified at my level of shouting during the incident and the time in between each call to the nurse to sort my problem out. I am fine now and just writing about my experience makes me feel better. I will not name the hospital or surgeon as there is no need to worry people about to have a op there. One point that did surprise me was I had no morphine pump after my op for pain relief and no drain which surprised me. I would be grateful for any comments on my experience. Hospital was in the SE U.K.

My left hip is needing to be done as soon as I say I'm ready. It's not quite as bad painwise as the right was as the arthritis is not as bad. Have some pretty sever pain but not everyday. 
I have cysts in the hip socket. They show on X-ray as black holes. 1 Dr said they could cause bone to crumble and that's not repairable. I don't want that happening. Has any one else had these cysts?  Trying to work out when to go for hip replacement. 
Thanks all.

"People keep telling me the PA is the old way and it takes a lot longer to recover due to the fact the large muscles are cut. I知 told the AA is far better for a quicker recovery as the muscles are simply held back.
I知 due the PA as my surgeon says he much prefers this way to get easier access to the hip. Anyone had this method recently??  Thanks

"My god what else can go wrong, horrendously low blood pressure, 1st blood test after op showed borderline anaemia now 4 days post op it痴 gone down again - a lot - so
blood transfusion needed. 
Thanks to all you lovely people on here I now understand how common low blood pressure after a THR is. But I致e just been told my 2nd blood test is lower than my first so not only have I now got to have a blood transfusion but they can稚 get a cannula in because my veins keep collapsing. Have any of you hippies had this happen and why do you get more anaemic as the days post op go on?

"i am in the US and waiting for a surgical appointment for a Lt. THR. At my appt. with the surgeon he told me he uses an anterior approach with the HANA table and uses a metal on metal implant.  I went home to research this implant and scared myself into wanting to cancel because of all the lawsuits over Metallosis, necrosis, pseudo tumors, kidney failure, heart myopathy, rashes etc.  and the fact they don稚 all go away with a removal and a revision.  So I tried to find out what implants are used for those with metal allergies or those who need revisions but I am having trouble finding an alternative to the MoM hip. I am not allergic to any metals that I know of and have set up another appointment to discuss any alternatives with my doc. The complication list due to metal ion infusion and blood levels of cobalt and chromium really freaked me out, especially since they might be permanent.
Can anyone enlighten me on alternatives or tell me That I am being overly anxious?  I知 a very active 70 with no complicating diseases, and I壇 like to not invite a lifetime of monitoring blood levels and wondering when or if my symptoms get so bad it will need to come out. My level of pain required medication and I am pretty restricted in walking and bending over.  I would rather get the revision one the first time. I read that here is one being worked on in Germany that is ceramic but no date when it might be released and no idea at all when the FDA here would approve it.  So there is no use waiting for that.  Does anyone out in hip land have any info that could help me with my decision?  Thank you all for being here.

"Hi I had my RTHR 4 days ago and after buying all these grabbing aids etc the hospital has given out a new book about exercises. Apparently we can now bend right down to pick things up and twist if necessary and sleep on either side immediately after op. The physios also told us there are now no restrictions and my consultant who trained at Stanmore said times are proving the precautions of the past aren稚 necessary if the op went ok and if it wasn稚 a revision. Obviously you don稚 keep on doing everything as before as it痴 too much for your physical strength but I must admit I was very surprised we can now bend right down immediately after the op. I知 not good at sleeping on my side and last night in hospital I tried sleeping on the non-operated side ( the other side was too painful). It was ok but managed to roll up my wound dressing so a bit of blood on sheets and a new dressing applied. Anyone else been told to ignore the old rules?

"Hi everyone
I haven't posted for a long time but continue to follow the forum.There is always something new and helpful to learn from fellow hippies.
Non-hippies are sympathetic and well meaning but don't understand our particular concerns.
I am now 13 months post op and due for a check-up on Monday.
I have been very fortunate with my left thr. No real problems except some which I believe I have caused by my own stupidity.
Basically I have been in Cyprus for an extended stay and proudly walked for miles daily without incident,despite hazardous conditions,eneven pavements etc.That was back in early April.
Then as the weather warmed up I started to swim. Maybe over confident by then,running up rough brick steps in flip-flops I fell heavily scraping the skin from the shin of my left leg.Scarily it took 6 weeks to heal and I was very worried about the pos.of infection.As it began to heal I pulled off the tape holding a dressing in place.The tape pulled away a chunk of skin and opened up a further wound.Just as this began to heal I managed to catch the same leg on the bottom of my car door. So 3 wounds one above the other on the operated leg! 
Incredibly the hip seemed to be quite OK!
The next stupid thing I did a few weeks later was to trip on a steep curb and fall heavily
hurting the knee of the same leg.So painful it took my breath away and I could hardly  weight bear to stand up. I struggled for a few weeks with walking and stair climbing difficulty.However the hip was not complaining!
The concern I now have is that my left leg below the knee is a completely different size to the other one, thicker and quite hard.It was only when a friend asked if I had any swelling around the knee injury that I compared the two.
The fall was 7th Sept. and on returning home in October I saw a doctor at my local practice.They seemed to take it quite seriously taking a blood test to rule out DVT.
Luckily that was negative but the Dr. asked me whether the change was following the fall or before.
Stupidly I have no idea. I was hoping the leg would right itself by now before my one year check-up which is now overdue but the thickened leg stubbornly remains the same, thick and hard  but less painful.
I am walking normally now and still the hip giving no trouble.
Only a little butt ache when sitting for too long and slight pain from time to time in thigh and side of hip but so slight,hardly worth a mention.
Sorry for such a long explanation,but needed to make it clear.What I need to know is whether the change in the lower leg is usual and part of the healing process,and will it get back to normal?
Also to remind others that we need to respect and take care of our new hips.
If things are going well it is all to easy to get over confident and careless.Falling over is not a good idea and we are a little more vulnerable than before thr.
Wishing you all a good recovery, and more sense than I have shown.
At 13 weeks post op. there are still concerns and the support of the forum is a godsend.
Love to all

"I finally got results of the bone scan my 2nd opinion surgeon ordered, and they found nothing. I sat and cried for 10 minutes after this news.
I have reported here before that 10 months post-op I am still miserable and in pain 24/7. My entire right thigh and buttock are in pain, I still need to use a cane for steps and walking more than 50 feet. I have trouble sleeping because I can't lie on the operated side for more than a few minutes, can't sleep on my back, and can't turn myself in the bed. Sitting hurts, getting up hurts worse. More exercise = more pain, so the only exercise I do is in the pool. I think I probably still need more stretching and strengthening, but I have no more physiotherapy - told I don't need it and have used up all my Medicare benefit for it anyway.
I have had 2 tests: a CT scan and a nuclear imaging bone scan. Neither showed anything. Not that I wanted something to be wrong exactly, I just wanted there to be something fixable.
I had anterior approach, and it was horrible from the very beginning. My life has been kind of on hold (re travel plans and that sort of thing), waiting for an answer. Now it seems there is no answer. I have no idea if it will eventually go away or if I will have to live with this forever.
I am 70, normally very active, I am a yoga teacher, love to travel and hike. I wish I had never had the replacement done. Pain was bad before surgery, but at least it was intermittent then. I feel as if this THR has really compromised my quality of life.
Next stop is a pain management specialist. I am very reluctant to go (and can't/won't take narcotics). But what choice do I have now?

"Well, quelle surprise.  After 2.1/2 years of pain, my xrays have revealed that the greater trochanter sustained a type 3 fracture during surgery.  This happens in 3% of surgeries, with 2% of those leaving the patient with intractable pain.  It is very difficult to correct (the broken piece being more than 2cm).  That has been poking into my soft tissue and I still cannot lie on operated side.  Further, the hospital has photoshopped the immediate post op xray.  they have shaded out the broken piece, and cropped the edges of the trochanter.  They never responded to my calls, never saw surgeon after op; he walked past my bed several times to other patients.  That op will go down on his numbers, yet it was NOT a good result.  I have to see a private surgeon re the other side who will assess whether the NHS op needs to be revised.  Sometimes apparently they use a claw to re-attach the bone.  In my case, the broken piece has been laying down new bone.  So you can imagine the pain grows exponentially with the size.  I would have preferred to lose a limb than go through the agony of that surgery and the (non) recovery.    I am getting quite unwell with the prospect of a new surgery on the other side, but at least the private surgeon has done 3,000.  My previous was around 80,  Check the surgeon's numbers I urge you.  You don't want someone practising on you.  My GP said they are so protected that you cannot do anything about a bad result.  They have insured the surgeons who do a poor job are untouchable.  I was operated on in a rush, last thing on a Friday afternoon.  My BMI was underweight, so I came out a skeleton at the most crucial time for healing.  I will be seeing my MP about the doctored xray and various other blatant unethical events  which beset me during and after the ordeal...

"I had a THR on the right (posterior) on Nov 9th. I am currently functioning at about 90%, just being cautious with the precautions. If I stretch the leg too much I get a bad cramp in the gluteus but other than that I have no issues walking, sitting, standing. I use a walker when out and about but not much at home, I just go slow and steady.
I had resurfacing on the left in 2007 and it broke 7 weeks in (pin through femur) so I ended up with a THR on that side. I remember recovery being very long, I remember using a walker for 4-5 weeks.
I'm hoping my recovery continues at this pace. I am doing my exercises but no PT was recommended, just walk, walk, walk.
Has anybody else experienced a speedy recovery? I only take pain meds at night when the leg is tired and cranky.

Also when I lay onto my good side this same thigh feels uncomfortable after a couple of minutes. Almost like the thigh is slightly arching. 
Have any of you experienced this in this area? I feel  a slight swelling in the knee also  when I bend it.

" We had a class on hip surgery along with a manual that supposed to prepare us properly. My first four days after surgery I only had discomfort.  Suddenly on the fifth day my calf and hip swelled up quite a bit. Naturally I was concerned about a blood clot. Having been given no knowledge about swelling following surgery I was  concerned. So I came here to ask people about their experiences with swelling. I am walking fine given the situation. I am doing the exercises as told.I have not taken any pain meds as yet. This is day seven and I am using ice for the swelling. I would appreciate people sharing with me their postoperative experiences.

"I am 6 weeks today, TRHR anterior approach. From day one I had zero pain and never had to take pain meds, only Tylenol. Stopped using walker the first week & stopped using cane by 3rd week.
By week five I started having knee pain, primarily in knee cap but also outer side & calf plus severe pain & stiffness in hip when getting up from a sitting position. Going into my 6th week, that pain is just as bad as pre-op.  To say I'm disheartened is an understatement!
I'm wondering if the PT exercises are causing the pain? I do them every day 2x a day. I'm wondering if just walking and riding stationary bike is enough exercise to strengthen those muscles and forget the ones the PT gave me??

"Hi all, had my THR done last Tuesday,everything went well. I am so glad I found this site, as I opted for spinal block and sedation which was done. Didn't have that awful dreaded feeling before the general anaesthetic or after. I did however stay in for 5 days. Home now and being very well looked after by my oh. I do have days where I do feel pretty rotten and have swelling in the leg and buttock, but it's all part of the healing process i think. One thing I have noticed is that when I stand my operated leg up fully i have to stand on my tip goes on my other leg to seem as if I'm straight at the correct height. I did mention this to the physio and was told it would go back to normal as my other hip had been compensating for such a long time. I wasn't straightening my knee to walk because of this. So I shall address it again if it doesn't correct t itself by the time I see the physio at hospital again. Thanks for all your lovely comments and help on my original post.

"I had a right hip replacement 17 days ago. As well as all the 創ormal expected post op symtoms, I am concerned as to this new symptom that has started over the last week. It starts through the night and wakes me up as an electric shock/cramp-like/tingling/vibrating sensation down the whole of my operated leg.
It comes like contractions every 10-20 seconds and the only way to get temporary relief is to either sit on the edge of my bed with my feet on the floor or get up and walk around with my crutches. This goes on for most of the night and I知 totally shattered and frustrated.
I went to see my GP who says it痴 the sciatic nerve healing and prescribed nerve drugs, which I知 reluctant to take, as I want to get off my post op drugs not add to them. After researching this theory, apparently permanent damage can be done to the sciatic nerve during surgery.
Has anyone else experienced these symptoms after a THR?
I知 58 years old and feeling extremely worried?
Thank you for reading.

"I have posted already about an infected scar round the staples. Surgeon decided not to operate again.. to clean out wound.. but still pretty inflamed and I am on a second dose of antibiotics. Not penicillin as I once had a reaction to it, but clindamycin.. 8 capsules a day!!! I don稚 feel great.. bad mouth.. slightly dizzy sometimes and wound tickles sometimes .. particularly at night! Ice pack helps a bit and take piritron from time to time. 
Area pretty swollen and darkish red. Seeing surgeon again in 3 weeks unless I知 worried. 
Had a massage yesterday.. as much as she could do on my back!! Pretty sore all over today. 
So, lying about and reading, listening to radio.. little walks from time to time.. patience is not my middle name!!!
Forgot to say that the hip done in June is more sore and twitchy than it was!! 
Not sure whether to put anything on scar .. quite hot sometimes.. but no oozing. Any comments??

"I am writing to describe recent problems that I am having regarding my hip replacement (posterior).   Something is not right with either thigh muscles or the implant.  During the past month the health of my hip has deteriorated significantly.   Walking is difficult.  Stairs are only possible if I have a hand railing on the left side.   Pain is constant from deep within my thigh.
Situation Analysis -
It has been ~5 months since the surgery.   I was basically pain free enjoying unlimited mobility up to ~ 5 weeks ago.
I am quite fit (5'9 158 lbs).  During the second month after surgery I was walking ~30 miles a week, hiking, riding my bike ~40 miles, and exercising daily including 5 weeks of physical therapy.
I have been working in China for the past 3 months and have maintained my daily gym workout routine of cardio and weights adding in rowing, swimming/pool running (deep water) and local walking and hiking in excess of 100k steps/week.  In addition, I have maintained and expanded the exercises outlined during therapy including foam rollers and massage.
My recent pain began ~4 weeks ago while carrying a suitcase upstairs.  I have had repeated episodes walking both up and down stairs.  I have also had an episode after slipping on some standing water in a hotel.
The shooting pain radiates from deep in my upper thigh and basically causes my entire body to lock up.  The pain is level 10, worst possible.  I lose all control and usually stumble catching myself on my left leg.  My body tenses causing my groin, glutes, back, neck, and calves are all sore the following day.  In each case the problem subsides after 30 seconds and I am able to slowly resume walking.  The incident takes my breath away.  My wife has observed this from behind and she said my entire body shuddered.  She thought I was going to fall.  After each incident I limp badly for a few hours and end up walking with a limp for days afterward.  My pain in the thigh is a constant level 2-3.  I take Aleve to counter the pain and swelling.   
I now walk with sever rocking, I can walk all day on flat surfaces, but the deterioration of my stride and gait is concerning.   
Any insight will be appreciated.  I meet with my surgeon next week. Thanks!
This is my second hip.  The right hip, 5 years ago, anterior, went very well with no issues.

I have c tightness and burningI can稚 sleep on my left side, and constantly wake up to burning aching pain at night.  The Drs say it痴 nerve damage, and that it will go away, but 1.5 years later- I知 still in chronic pain and can稚 sit or stand for more than 5 minutes without the volume of my pain turning up!  Also, I was fit and athletic before my surgery and now I can barely walk a block without my hip tightening up and aching.  No one seems to be able to help me!  I知 so afraid of a revision as the Dr. says the implant looks fine, but he痴 only taken X-rays and no MRI to look at the soft tissue.  I知 also concerned - if anyone else has feedback and has experienced the same and found a resolution please share.

"47yo anterior approach, 20
Wks Post . First, Happy Thanksgiving to those celebrating today. 
 My THR anterior was the first week of July, 2017. My recovery was described as 妬ncredibly slow... I did 12 weeks of Outpatient PT, massage work, chiropractor, ice, light exercise, 2 Prednisone packs.... Somewhere around 12 to 14 weeks I noticed a plateau. Around 16-17 weeks began to need my cane again intermittently. My surgeon finally referred me for a 2nd optinion (had it Tues). He suspects impingement and basically recommended a 鍍otal re-do removing my current device (one he doesn稚 use), make some improvements and resolve the impingement. It痴 a terrifying thought since this road has been such a tough one. I am getting another opinion in a couple weeks as well. 
Anyone have revision experience this soon in the process?

"I will be nearly 69 when I get the first of my new ceramic and plastic hips uncemented, not sure if from the front, rear or anterior. I had been out with a cycle group doing two 80km rides a week but had to stop a year ago due to groin pain and increasing pain at nights due to wear and tear. I was diagnosed with arthritis in my hips since the age of 39 and have managed to nurse it along until now. Anyway my question is will I be able to go back to long rides or will I wear out the plastic liner prematurely.
Common sense tells me that it would probably wear the joint out and I could be quite happy just going for 20 km rides at a leisurely pace. My consultant said he would get me on a bike again but his idea of cycling maybe different than mine. I will ask my consultant after the op if long distance cycling would be feasable but just wondered what people who have had replacements think would be the wear rates at higher cycling milages.
Thanks for reading and I hope to contribute more once Ive had my first hip done.

"Hi everyone and especially the people who just had surgery.  I'm exactly 4 weeks today from TLHR and for the first time last night I was able to sleep on the operated side with a pillow between my legs.  I've been sleeping on the good side with the pillow but wondered when I would ever be able to sleep on the bad side since I'm not a back sleeper and since surgery sleeping has been so uncomfortable.  I'm so happy that I can sleep on both sides now...it's a wonder what a good night's sleep will do for the psyche...that and taking a shower! I was also so wiped out last nite from a couple of new physical therapy exercises that I was getting a little concerned.  But boy a small step can work wonders! Even though pt can be tough..the more I practice but not push too hard..the stronger I feel.  I hope this helps some of the people right out of surgery since those first few weeks can be worrisome but it does get better!

"Hi everyone, I have been having pain in my hip that I got thr surgery on. I had surgery on April 3, 2027 so about 6 months ago. I had a VERY painful front groin pain and still have not been able to put pants on without pain,  putting  on shoes and not able to lift my leg in a straightened position lying on my back. The doctor said I would be able to lift the leg in that way after 12 weeks. I believed him. Now well past 12 weeks and I still can't lift it. I have also had severe numbness down the front of my thigh and to my knee. This was there right away after the surgery. And now the numbness is going away in some spots and am having shooting pain in a spot by my knee. And the entire front of my leg, from right below the incision all the way to my knee is just so painful that even when my kids tap that area to get my attention it is painful. I have also had some burning pain that was apparent right after surgery in the numb leg which I had discussed with the doctor, along with having a discussion about the numbness.
I had gone back to see him several times now and every time I have come in with another complaint, he has just not even have seemed to care. The only time he looked at the hip was the first and second follow up visits. The last three he has not even looked at the hip. I also have noticed that my muscle looks like it is bunched up below the scar, almost like it has come apart or wasn't sewn right. But the doctor did not ask to see it despite me telling that I was having pain in that area. I have had to wait a month or more each time I came back, so the pain was just getting worse and the tendon became so painful even after taking major doses of nsaids voltarin, zovarex, ibuprofen and tylonel  which he prescribed all at the same time. He prescribed the prescription only about the third or fourth  post op visit. This was not a good idea to take all four medications apparently because I had told him that is what I was doing he had a shocked look on his face and told me that I can't take the two prescription meds together. Yet I was prescribed the two medications at the same time, therefore it was his fault I took them together because I didn't know I could only take one of those and not both, but why would he prescribe both if he didn't intend for me to take both. I have also been having back pain, pinching pain in the pelvic area and can physically feel like I'm walking up a step when I am stepping forward. And I know it is noticeable when in public. 
All of this has caused pain, increased anxiety and depression that I had prior to surgery. This has been getting much worse than prior to surgery. Not to mention not being able to sleep at all some nights from worrying about why my hip and leg still hurts. 
So yesterday I went to see a revision specialist to look at it, and boy oh boy is this doctor so much more empathic than the surgeon who did the thr. This is because I feel like the surgeon just did not give a rats, you know what, about me telling him I'm having this pain. The only thing he has done was prescribe nsaids and order steroid shots the last time I went to him. Anyhow the new doc has said that my leg that had the thr is about 1 inch longer than the other. And now I have to possibly go through another surgery to fix it. So I'm am now worrying even more because I'm terribly afraid to have to do another surgery on this leg. The bad experiences has totally turned me off to that option. The dr said it was absolutely not right that my right leg that's longer is very noticeable by examination. 
I had also told her about the bunched up muscle and the then examined it. She said it was unusual and wasn't sure what caused it. Also she has ordered bloodwork and wants me to go in for an MRI as well as a joint aspiration. Not sure if I said that right. The fluid will then be taken to a special lab not in my state, it is the only lab that tests for what they will be looking for. So in just one visit this doctor has showed  more of an inclination to help me than my surgeon did the whole time I saw him.  
Now I am left wondering why the surgeon never checked leg length after surgery. Nor did he even ask to see the leg the last three times I went in. He never let me see any X-rays the second time on. He just kept saying that everything looks great but that is far from the truth he just didn't care to listen to what I was saying. 
I don't know what to do if I have to go through another surgery to fix this. I'm very scared it will boil down to that.  
I'm just needing some advice as to what I should do from this point. 
Thank you in advance for any replies you can offer to possibly help me.
Thank you

" I am 11 weeks post operation for a by lateral posterior total hip replacement. My right side is a complete non-issue and feels as if nothing is happened but my left is another story. I have stiffness in my buttocks and days of discomfort overall but on the worst days I have a rather annoying problem and wanted to see if anyone else shares my dilemma. I have read posts where people are complaining of groin pain but my discomfort in that area is a little bit more specific. To be blunt, when my left but cheek and thigh are sore it feels as if my left testicle is under pressure. Almost feels like half my scrotum is being squeezed. It痴 rather uncomfortable and annoying and I have to fight the urge to adjust since I know it痴 coming from the inside. 
Does anyone at all experience this? I知 assuming it痴 related to the hip replacement but you can never be too careful and I will bring it up with my doctor. It would be reassuring however if anyone else has gone through it. Thank you, Brian

"On many of these threads, members refer to whether or not you should wear compression stockings and for how long. They also refer to taking blood thinners. These two areas of treatment seem to be very misunderstood. All patients undergoing a hip replacement should in the first instance ask their surgeon what is advised but if in doubt the following may help.
Compression stockings are used after surgery to prevent blood clots developing in the leg which is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). They are normally recommended if it is likely that you will be unable to move around much after surgery; either due to the after-effects of surgery or having another medical condition affecting your mobility.
When you're admitted to hospital, your risk of DVT will be assessed by your surgeon to decide whether you need compression stockings. You may need to wear stockings even if you're able to leave hospital on the same day as your operation. They should normally be worn until you are mobile and have stopped taking the anticoagulant drugs
Anticoagulants such as Pradaxa work by interrupting the process involved in the formation of blood clots. They're sometimes called ""blood-thinning"" medicines, although they don't actually make the blood thinner. Used for similar purposes, anticoagulants are different to blood thinners, such as low-dose aspirin.
Always ask your surgeon about these issues.

"I sat in the pre-op ward yesterday from 7am to 5pm when the surgeon came through and told me my op had had to be cancelled. I went into a sort of shock. Apparently a scrub nurse had dropped the last remaining sterilised pack of instruments on the theatre floor - I was last to go in - and there were no more. The surgeon was so apologetic. It wasn't his fault but I felt like going out shopping the next morning for a voodoo doll. He said he could do a cemented hip (?) but he never liked to do that kind of op for anyone under 80.
This morning his secretary phoned to ask if I could go in a week on Saturday and I'd be first on the list. I'm reasonably happy again now and trying to not hold my breath....

"Very interested in speaking with patients that had either hip or knee replacement at the Cleveland Clinic especially the Weston Florida area. I had a hip replacement there Feb this year which is very problematic with a litany of problems showing carelessness on doctors part.. It was really a chop shop instead of paying attention and doing replacement correctly. I found my doctor had taken over $98,000 payola from Stryker!! Lets stand up and help each other!

"Hello
I've not had a hip replacement but another poster suggested I post my issue here as there are lots with hip experience.
I'm 39, female and have always had very clunky hips. For many years I would have a feeling like they were not sitting right, like slightly out of their socket and I would need to do a little movement to click them back in so I could move properly. I never thought of this as odd as other joints were a bit like this and it wasn't all that painful and was just the way I was. Things started to change a few years ago, I found lunges difficult and then about a year ago things started to get painful. It started to hurt when walking, my left hip had a crunching feeling, I could hear it in my body and it felt as though the bone wasn't sitting right but I could no longer pop it back in. Walking hurts, it's not excruciating but it's like a stomach churning feeling. It feels like bone on bone. I also get aching feelings at the top of my thighs, a more acute pain in my groin and a very painful lower back that feels more like a nerve type pain, particularly when I'm in any position for prolonged periods, so this usually wakes me and makes sleeping difficult . I find the lower back pain the hardest to cope with and can't tolerate this much at all. I also get a feeling in my hips that I can only describe as being like there was a knitting needle being stabbed into the joint. I was a very active person, exercised a lot (excessively), ran, did weight lifting but all this spec about 2 years ago because I also have chronic fatigue. Now my activity is daily yoga practice and about 20 min walk. If I walk longer, my hip really begins to hurt. I've been told that I'm hypermobile.
At the start of this year, I went to physio for about 4 months, I was very good with doing my exercises and during this time my pain and mobility got much worse. I don't know if that was just this issue progressing or the physio. They suggested I see a my Dr, get blood tests and x-ray. The bloods were fine but x-ray came back saying I had Femoracetabular Impingement but the GP didn't explain much about this and referred me to orthopaedics, which has a 9 month wait. I'll be seen in March.
I'm really struggling to manage my pain at the moment. I also have chronic fatigue syndrome. My fatigue started around the same time that my hips started to feel different. I know that when my hip and lower back pain is bad, my fatigue is much worse. I just don't know in which way they're related.
I hate using pain killers, normally I would never use anything but recently I have started to use things a lot more to try and improve my quality of life. Paracetamol can take the edge off when it's dull pain and I dint mind using that. The only thing that seems to help when it's bad is codeine but I'm now finding it's really bad a lot more often and I know that's addictive so I'm not taking it as regularly as I'd like to. I don't want to take nsaids as I know the havoc they play with the gut and I've had ibs in the past and worked so hard to resolve this.
I wondered if anyone had any advice about what I could do that could possibly help me just now managing this. I can manganese the pain during the day but it's at night I can't cope as it affects my sleep so much and then really impacts my energy and chronic fatigue symptoms.
I've also been prescribed a low dose amatriptaline but I've been too scared to start as it has so many side effects. I was going to wait until I'd seen the consultant but it's just so long away.
Can anyone share any advice or experiences that could help?

"I have noticed this past week, that every night something happens when I sleep. After about 5 hours in bed, I get a wicked pain in my hip, right where the incision is, that goes down my thigh and into my calf. If I sit up, it goes away. If I walk it goes away. It's woke me up every night for the past week. I take a muscle relaxer before I go to bed, but that doesn't seem to be helping. So my question is what happens to your muscles when you sleep...especially after THR?  Do they constrict/tighten because they're still trying to heal?  I'm 8 1/2 weeks post replacement...posterior.

"Hi everyone.  I have a problem I wondered if any of you have experienced. I will be 4 weeks since my surgery this Tuesday. I had one incision in the front of my leg. Had swelling so bad in my surgical leg and foot and ankles I couldn't put pressure on my foot or leg. Doing the exercises just made it swell more.  I went to Er twice and the ortho dr 2 times.  Was told this is a part of this and sent home with another appt in 5 weeks.  Had pt at home for 2 weeks but could hardly do the exercises. Hired a private nurse and started icing every 4 hours and heat and elevating.  Now went to out patient pt and he is doing a one on one for me like I just came out of surgery.  After a few days I am much better. Walking with walker very good heel to toe without putting too much weight on surgical leg but doing a lot of good walking. Swelling down some but i get a horrific pain in the top of my foot. About a 9 of a sharp  pain and then I prop it up take a oxey and wait for it to stop. Don't get me wrong. I have really realy made progress.   hope to graduate with a cane soon?  But this stabbing pain in my foot. Does anyone get this.  I am going to make an appointment with my regular dr. Because my ortho doesn't seem concerned.  I feel so behind. I had a test for blood clots and it was negative.   I ware support surgical stalkings per my nurse and my ortho said that was ok?    Just want to get past this. I work in real estate and am a writer author so I have been trying to do business while all this is transpiring and I am looking for that light in the tunnel. My surgical area is nice and clean and doesn't hurt.

"Hi,
I'm going in for my op on Thursday and wonder if a riser recliner would be good to both get up from (sofa a bit of a struggle as low) and sleep on. I sleep well on my side normally but won't be able to do this once i come home again. The type I mean takes you right up high as well as tip you out - well almost haha.
And I've bought some elephant feet from Amazon to raise up my sofa as it's a bit low and slouchy ( I've heard nothing from the occupational therapist who is supposed to come to your home although I have already handed over the measurements to pre assessment nurse). These blocks raise up your sofa/bed to about another 6 inches or so.
I would really appreciate your views on these two things as Im off on Thursday. Thank you again for all your invaluable help so far.

"Hi
I am due to have my left hip replaced and have asked my surgeon for anterior. He is not keen but instead is offering me the anterolateral approach but he says he would prefer to do it posterior. I do not want posterior as I still have problems with my right hip which are ongoing and I do not know what anterolateral is.
I have resisted undergoing the left for 4 years but now the pain is so unbearable that I have no choice.
Has anyone had both anterior and posterior and if so how did you find it. And has anyone had anterolateral?

"I see that a lady took some Tramadol - so common for THR patients - to Egypt with her, and has been arrested and chucked into jail for drug smuggling.
Apparently, according to Egyptian law, Tramadol is banned, and it doesn't matter that they were prescribed for her, it is still treated as drug smuggling.  As with other countries, ignorance of the law is no excuse.  In Egypt, people can be held in jail, with maybe 20-30 others who do not speak a word of your language in your cell, for up to two years pending a trial.  Drug smuggling can carry the death sentence in Egypt.
When travelling, do check with the country before you take strong painkillers such as opiates with you.

"I had a CT scan of my hip this week. The doctor says it all looks fine. I have a 3-phase bone scan scheduled for next week, and he will again call to let me know the results. But if the CT and x-rays are fine, how likely is the bone scan to show anything different?
Not that I want anything to be wrong, but if there isn't anything, then what? I am sick of being in pain- it is not excruciating, but it is just unrelenting. I am 9 1/2 months out, and never expected this much pain for so long. My life is kind of on hold while I wait to find out what, if anything, is wrong and what can be done. I don't mean in terms of normal stuff: I exercise daily and go about my business, although always in pain. But I can't make travel plans, and I dont know if my exercise regimen is good for me or not. I long ago finished all my physiotherapy, not allowed to do any more according to Medicare, so have no one to consult about what I should/should not be doing.
Success rate for THR is supposed to be at least 95%. If I am in the 5%, will I have to live with this forever? I just retired and want to do so many things. I have always been active, and hoped to spend my retirement years traveling. (Active travel, not cruises and the like.) I am sooo discouraged! I am only 70, and am not pleased to think that my life may have been irrevocably altered for the worse by this so-called ""fix"".

"My hip replacement was in feb 2014.  I had no post-op problems,  was back to yoga in 10 weeks and hiking several miles after that.  then, in Aug 2014, i developed a small front mid-hip pain.  Small!  I was still hiking.  At that time I was a young 68 and waking several miles every day.  By October 2014, I could not put weight on the leg, the small pain has morphed into a monster, and I had to crawl until I got crutches.  The first time, this happened, it lasted 3  weeks, followed by 3 months with no problems, but overtime, the episodes of pain came more often and stayed longer.  I am almost constantly on a crutch now.  I just had a bone scan today.  what will it reveal?  I believe either that the tip of the stem is supporting part of my leg when it should not, or that my artificial hip is loose. I will keep you posted.  Thank you all for your posts.

"Good morning all,
I am currently in week 20 of an 18-week waiting list for a THR, having seen my consultant back in June.
Last week I made a call to the Admissions Office for an update and was told that my 18-week clock had been re-started due to the fact that I was on holiday for the first 2 weeks of October and, therefore, unavailable for a short notice op (if one had been offered, which it wasn't).
I had informed the hospital of my holiday dates, as I was required to do, and at no time was I told of any policy that would 'bump' me off the list for taking holiday. The person I spoke to was adamant that I start at the bottom of the list again.
I emailed the patient liaison service a week ago and they are supposedly looking into this for me but, to be honest, I'm beginning to think they're just fobbing me off.
Not sure what to do next but I'm open to suggestions. Another 18 weeks does not bear thinking about.
Thank you.

"Hello group. I just joined the form today and I知 eager to speak with people familiar with my dilemma.
Just about 10 weeks ago I had a bilateral hip replacement at the age of 49. I was in horrible shape pre-op and initially felt better almost immediately. I was up and down stairs in the first week and my therapists all commented on how fast I was recovering.  I was initially so positive that helped with my energy and getting through the workouts. 
I really think my recovery stalled around the sixth or seventh week.  It seems I haven稚 progressed since then and have been doing the same exercises with the same weights and repetitions. 
I have no discomfort on my right side but I have a deep agonizing burn in my left buttock. When I told this to my surgeon he feels it痴 nothing to worry about and that the right side is the unusual one being pain-free so quick and the left side is on course with normal healing.
 I have three weeks until I go back to my physical job but I致e reached a point where I could literally sleep all day and I知 up all night by myself. I have no motivation to work out and I知 wondering if I should stay away from that until this pain subsides. I still have a supply oxycodone which I didn稚 use originally but I知 thinking about starting to take now.  I知 also prescribed one tramadol every six hours which I am taking with two Tylenol.
I guess I was just thinking I would be feeling much better by now. Any advice or suggestions is greatly appreciated, Brian

Even if it痴 for 3 minutes, sit for 1/2 hour, walk for 2 minutes, sit for an hour, walk for 5 minutes, etc.  I think just the random movement is the best thing you can do.  A week ago, I was not feeling good about my progression.  Today, much better..hope this helps the ones that are just coming off surgery.

"First of all I want to thank the forum for all the responses to my first post. Hearing from people that understand what I知 saying and going through means the world to me. I have all the faith in the world and my doctors to steer me through the medical phase of this but I also have all the faith in the world for those who have gone before me to get me through the human phase of it. 
I do have a question and I知 asking it gingerly but don稚 really know how to sugarcoat it.........I致e been married 21 years but since my surgery our sex life is so awkward and clumsy I think it痴 adding to my dim outlook. 
She痴 been great and understanding but I simply can稚 get into the positions she sometimes wants without causing pain or risk. We致e had a few episodes that end in nothing but frustration for both of us so it seems neither one of us is eager to get anything going. 
Am I just expecting this to get back to normal too soon or is it possibly exposing an underlying problem between us I didn稚 recognize before?
I know it痴 personal subject but any lights before I could shed on the subject also mean a lot to me. Thanks in advance, Brian

The first three weeks i mainly rested keeping legs raised with a little bit of walking in garden. I did not do PT exercises and i do think rest for first few weeks is very important mire than PT.

"I am 6 weeks LTHR tomorrow, and only vaguely instructed to follow 90 degree restrictions for 6 weeks when I left hospital, which I have followed. I have been doing fairly well, although having a new posterior pain at the base of the buttock and new groin pain, which I assumed was because I have stepped up the resistance exercises and doing more walking. So, whilst visiting relatives yesterday I totally forgot I have mostly been sitting on high chairs / dining chairs, and went straight for a squishy sofa as the height looked okay (I'm quite short anyway) Soft furnishings are definitely a no - no! As soon as I sat on it i was so uncomfortable I had to get up, and now have generalised pain through the hip, down the thigh etc. I don't think anything dramatic has happened, but wonder from other hippies how long we have to carry on sitting in high nursing home style rigid chairs? Do we ever get back to the point of normality or is this our new life now?

"As I have written before, I am pretty far into my right THR recovery--had surgery fully 9 months ago. Afterward, I was still having a lot of pain, to the point of wishing I'd never had it done.  I did exactly what they told me, including every one of the physical therapy sessions Medicare would cover, and all my exercises at home, plus walking daily.  Before surgery, my hip was arthritic, with intense pain on certain activities and it would occasionally just lock up when I sat in one place for a while.  But after the surgery, the pain has never gone away.  It is less  intense than before the operation, but has been 24/7 ever since, both sharp and achy, and also pervasive--from my waist to my knee, front, back, groin, and side.  It was worst in bed, when trying to turn over, or after sitting for a long time. I sometimes could not turn over at all while lying down, and was entirely unable to lift up the knee of the surgical leg  when in a ""clamshell"" position. After a horrible post-op period for 2 - 3 months, and then many ups and downs, I thought I was on the mend, but then had a downturn the beginning of July (6 month mark) and another one in mid-September --at that point, I went back to using a cane.  I returned three times to the surgeon, and each time he took an x-ray, then said everything looked fine.  It was clearly NOT fine, and impacting the quality of my life, so I called some other docs for a second opinion.  Finally got a an appointment with  a new orthopedist tomorrow--at last!!!!  But here is the weird thing--all of sudden, literally overnight, just about a week ago the pain decreased.  Still 24/7, still in my entire hip area, but mostly it now feels like just a deep ache.  The sharp pain, and the kind of pain that made me feel something was seriously wrong after my two declines, has mostly gone.   It still gets worse when I exercise a lot, and sitting and lying bed still are bad, but it kind of feels like ""normal"" healing pain after surgery--although about what I would have expected in months 1 -3, not this late in the game.  I do plan to keep my appointment tomorrow, of course, but I feel like the person with a bad toothache who goes to the dentist and that day it disappears!  Has anyone else had this experience (at any stage of healing) where they had serious sharp pain and then it went overnight to being just a deep and miserable ache?  I have been getting deep tissue massage in the area, and my therapist thought my whole leg was out of alignment, she has spent quite a bit of time trying to make sure my femur is seated properly in its cup.  Now I wonder if she managed to do that--it was not seated before and now it is?  Would that have caused the kind of pain I was having before?   Just wondering how/why this sudden change would occur.  Att his point last week I was about 90% sure I was going to need some kind of revision to fix what was wrong, now I wonder if I am just a very very very slow healer.

"All us hippies know that information on what we can and can't do and when differs greatly. Well. ......I fell over at 6 weeks post op and saw the surgeon who performed op to check all was ok which thankfully it was. He told me that I could now relax all restrictions but to remember to take it easy.
Yesterday I had my scheduled post op assessment at 14 weeks post op.
I saw a member of his team and was told to continue with 90 degree restrictions until 6 months !!!!
I've come to the conclusion that they all use their own interpretation and that we have to listen to our own bodies more than medical bods. I've been sleeping on both sides and breaking 90 degrees for weeks now and my body doesn't dislike it.
It's no wonder that there is so much confusion surrounding recovery.

"Those of us struggling with groin & hip pain after THR. I found some information that may help you better understand what is going on with your hip.
""Post-THA iliopsoas impingement was first reported by Lequesne et al., in 1991 [9]. It is believed to be caused by contact or friction between the iliopsoas tendon and the acetabular component, which is the mechanical stimulation that triggers pain onset. Such stimulation can occur with both cemented and uncemented cups, but can be caused by the outflow of cement, anterior projection of the flange cup when cement is used, or by projection of the cup or a screw from the anterior acetabular margin when cementless techniques are used [9]. Kerboull reinforcement device is widely used for hip surgery in world with excellent results [10,11]. To the best of our knowledge, no report has been published concerning about the iliopsoas impingement after revision surgery with an acetabular reinforcement device. Our case demonstrated a possibility of the incidence of iliopsoas impingent with those acetabular reinforcent devices.""

"I am a 43 year old female with bilateral hip dysplasia. Approximately 3 years ago I started  having stabbing pain in my left hip which progressed rapidly and after a while really struggled to get through my day, even with painkillers. I was diagnosed with a labral tear and had an Arthroscopy 12 weeks ago. I followed all instructions and did my exercises religiously. My hip is no longer clicking in and out when I stand and the pain is less, however, I can not physically walk without a limp which is making everything sore. By the end of the working week I can not sleep as the pain is constant. My hip still feels like its being stabbed at times and standing still for more than 5 minutes is agony. I just want to be able to go for a walk and that doesn't seem like it is going to happen. My sports physician thinks that the only thing left to do is have a THR. I see the Orthopaedic surgeon tomorrow. Has anyone been in a similar situation and been able to walk successfully afterwards? I will have 7-8 weeks off work after the surgery and really hope to return feeling better than ever. I teach 5 year olds, so energy is a must!

"Hello All,
I am beginning to suspect I might be a candidate for bilateral replacement.  Left hip x ray indicated severe OA in Sept. 2015.  Chiro, PT, deep tissue and exercise has allowed me to manage the decline but barely.  In recent weeks I've noticed pain developing in right hip, joint getting ""stuck"", painful enough to wake me when sleeping and most recently when weight bearing on right hip it will suddenly ""give out"" with a nasty shot of pain.  I'll re-balance and move on but it doesn't seem promising.  I'm moving from resisting the whole idea of one replacement to accepting both need to be done.  Bummer for me.
Currently waiting here in the US for the insurance plans to be rolled out as I have no insurance now and will be selecting my coverage to insure the surgeons I have focused on accept that carrier.  Been researching several surgeons but have yet to schedule appointments.  A recent poster who had undergone bilateral replacement was covered by Kaiser and had to fight to get bilateral covered and succeeded despite the insurance company's resistance to cover bilateral.  My apologies, but I don't remember that persons handle and if they come across this post would be very interested in discussing this situation with them, both the insurance issue and their surgical issues.  Any and all others are also more than welcome to make their contributions.
Onward.

I sometimes think I will stop coming on the forum but it is the nicest place to be certainly online, and especially if you need sound advice.
I am getting ever more closer to my next hip replacement and wanted to ask you all about the super path hip replacement? Can you recommend any surgeons for this type of surgery? What was your experience?
I live in the Cotswolds in England, but will happily travel anywhere if it means a quicker recovery. I had a good surgeon last time, I am not so keen on the hospital so exploring all options (again)
At least I am not terrified this time (maybe a small tiny bit in the middle of the night) but not fearing it anywhere near as much. Can see from last time I don't have much longer left, as usual pathway to THR is an easy one to follow from beginning to end at least! 
All the best to you all, and happy new hips!

"Hi.  I'm a 55-year-old female 6 weeks status post left anterior THA. Two weeks after sx I was diagnosed with a DVT in my left calf behind the knee.  I have been prescribed  Eliquis and will take for 3 months and then repeat ultrasound.  I also have thigh and back pain. I go to physical therapy 3 times a week.  I am unable to lie flat on my back so unable to get hip into neutral position. Therapist is unable to manuever hip as much as he would like due to pain. I take Oxycodone 10 mg every 6 hours for pain. I am still using a walker to ambulate due to intense pain. 
I feel I am behind in recovery. My surgeon has taken x-rays at 2,4 and 6 weeks and they are normal. No problem with hip hardware. He is unsure why I continue with this amount of pain.  He would like me to get a back MRI, however I can't lay flat so he would like to do it under sedation. He also thinks a cortisone injection via fluoroscopy would help the thigh pain. 
My surgeon suggested I get a second opinion. I am going this Friday. He doesn't want to order any tests until I see the second doctor.
I never thought recovery would be this intense. I have been dealt these complications and would like to know when I will be feeling better.
Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated.

"This is based on UK NHS practice Male aged 70 and does not reflect on other countries.
Although I carried out a huge amount of research prior to my hip replacement, at the end of the day it is down to the Surgeon what happens. I had been diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis of the right hip and had to admit that something must be done. When my GP, my wife and myself finally made the decision to go ahead I was pleased to find he had me admitted to a private hospital under the NHS choices scheme. I can only say that first impressions were very good when compared to our local hospitals that carry out this operation. I received a full package from the hospital including an appointment only 10 days after my GPs phone call.
The Interview with the Surgeon:
The surgeon was extremely well qualified and carries out  over 100 hip replacement operations a year. He was full of confidence and this transferred to me. He was surprised that I asked so many questions as to the approach, the type of material used, size of new ball etc but did answer them. He asked me what dates were suitable for me and the ball was set in motion.
The Assessment:
This was 2 weeks prior to the operation and took the usual blood and swabs to ensure I was not carrying the ""Black Death"" into the hospital with me. I was given free (ex gratis) a raised toilet seat, a grab stick and a long shoe horn. I was told what to expect and treated very well.
 The Admission:
The day of admission (13:00hrs)and we arrived at the hospital with a suitcase packed for 5 days. No food after 11:00hrs in the morning but drinking water up to 13:00 hrs. Funnily, all of the lockers are ground height and no one after a hip or knee operation could take items in or out of their lockers. After unpacking my wife left and also left the car in the car park rather than take the journey back on her own. She then took a 3 hour bus journey.. NHS please note; no parking charges at a private hospital.
The Operation:
At 16:00hrs I was taken to surgery. It took a bit to get me under as I am resistant to drugs but I woke up in my bed at 18:30hrs with my legs straddled apart and a large plastic wedge between them keeping my bones at the correct angle. The Auxiliary Nurses were wonderful, much better than the ""I am better than you because I have a degree"" university trained nurse that was in charge. They could not do enough for their patients while the registered nurse would not do anything. I was made comfortable, asked if I wanted some dinner (no appetite after an operation). I called my wife and told her all went well and to put away the insurance policy as she would not need it.
I have noticed that the type of approach, anterior vs posterior depends on the surgeon. A lot of women on here seem to have the anterior approach which is interesting as it does not offer the surgeon as easy an approach to the joints as the posterior but does make recover quicker. All of the discussions on the topic state that the anterior approach is less effective with regards to securing the new hip joint than the posterior so I wonder if people are given the choice or whether the surgeon just makes the decision. Perhaps it is a country specific thing. I do not know.
Recovery:
There were 4 other patients in the NHS ward. The longest had been there 9 days and the shortest 4 days. They all were having trouble getting over the pain and walking on crutches despite a first class physio. This scared me.  My first night went bad after an argument with the registered nurse who insisted I had to have a catheter before she went off duty and pass some urine. I said I wanted a cup of tea and this would enable me to pass some into a bottle while laying flat on my back. Her attitude was that she was not  there to make tea so I pointed out that tea was a diuretic and would help. One hour later and urine passed. Nurse please note for future patients!
Physio arrived at 10:00rs and within 30 minutes I was walking with the aid of a Zimmer frame. By the time my wife visited me I was on crutches and walking around the hospital. The physio was very good, strict but good. At 16:00 hrs just after my wife had left, the physio asked me to take the steps and hill tests and then said I was good to go. Checked my blood results and X rays and all was good. I called my wife to tell her to pick collect me in the morning just as my surgeon arrived to see if I felt good enough to go home. There is a secret here to getting early release, it is listen to your physiotherapist, they know what they are doing. Do not wallow in self pity and ask for more morphine, it does not make you better. Accept you are in pain, you have just had invasive surgery. Once home you brighten up immediately. Having four other whining patients in the room crying out at night for pain killers helps for a quick exit as well.
At Home:
Your leg will be swollen badly. The surgeon will have been moving it into positions it was never intended to be in to gain access to the various joints. You will be off your food for a few days. You will have trouble sleeping on your back. You will have constipation for a few days. Eat plenty of fruit and drink a lot of water. Wear those awful TED stockings and take your anti blood clotting tablets. Within a few weeks you will be fit enough to go out with the aid one crutch only. Sore muscles, pain and trouble sleeping are part of the recovery. Depression is normal and will pass.
I am now at 3 weeks and about to go out shopping with the wife. I look forward to the trips out as it exercises my leg better than anything else. My wife has set me targets and my next one is a bath. How I long for one. Only one week to go. I am lucky in having an ex Matron (a real Matron trained in Glasgow in the 70s, not a paper qualified one) as a wife and she knows exactly how to treat me and it is not with TLC. She is bossy and accepts no excuses. she views this as a minor injury and continually tells me that she has seen and dealt with a lot worse than this so stop complaining and be a man....It works.
Bottom line:
There are many more operation worse than a hip replacement. Technology is marvellous and these new ceramic and poly hips will last for decades. Pain and depression is to be expected but it will get better day by day. there will be set backs but progression will occur. The one thing I always try to do is to stop taking pain killers as soon as possible. They are just chemicals that are masking the problem. They do not cure anything and you can become addicted to them. Think of the pain you were in prior to the op and compare. It is now a different pain but one that will go away. Finally, talking and writing about it help you and others. The more knowledge as to how others are affected helps us all. We are not alone, it just seems like it at times.

"Hi all, I  now 11 weeks post op THR and stopped using my crutch last week as I didn稚 feel that I needed it. It痴 also a bit awkward having to do the commute into London with it. 
Anyway, since Sunday evening, I致e been experiencing really bad pain on the inside of my knees. I had to take 2 400mg ibuprofen last night, just to help me sleep. Most of the time I am walking without a limo, but I do find myself limping when I initially get up, and by the end of the day when I知 tired. 
Has anyone else experienced this issue with knee pain? I had stopped physio, but wondering now if it was a bit premature.

"Hi
I am 22 weeks post op my second thru, the first was February 2017. I am now feeling the benefits of my hip replacements and walking, swimming and cycling are all going well. I have decided not to return to running or other impactful sports as I am 52yrs old and want to try to delay the inevitable revisions as long as possible.
I was signed off by the physio at 6 weeks post op and feel like I could benefit from further physio.  the things I am still struggling with are things like bend to pick something up or tying shoelaces or getting up and down from the floor.
. I need advice on identifying which muscles need targetting and whether I would benefit from stretching exercises and pilates. I was always limited in my range of movement by perthes but hoped to gain a greater range of hip flexion with my new hips
any advice on this or on how to locate a good private physio with THR experience will be gratefully received

"I am 6 weeks post TLHR - anterior approach. All was progressing well albeit a bit slowly as I cannot tolerate so many of the pain medication. Then about 2 weeks ago terrible knee pain started. My knee bizarrely is numb as is my left shin, but I could barely touch it. The pain is a burning,  tingling, shooting sort of sensation - so am assuming nerve pain. Also my left leg feels longer & I have a limp. Actually it is longer as I have scoliosis. I feel so imbalanced atm. I am using elbow crutches & can go down my front steps
& can walk to the end of my (short) street & back. Which I am doing 2  - 3 x day. I feel as though my progress is much too slow. Anyone else experienced this kind of nerve pain in the knee & the feeling of imbalance? I guess I should stick with the elbow crutches until my knee is better & my gait improves. Thanks! Maureen

"Hi everyone, I am 50 years old and I just finished my 6th week after THR on my left hip. I have been following this forum as a sanity check.  It is good to know that everyone has a different pace because I often felt like I was not progressing fast enough.  I am walking with a cane, otherwise I limp.  The pain is only an issue on days that I have physio and even that is manageable.  I do get the 'pulling' pain/feeling in my groin a lot. My sleep pattern is awful.  I have just started laying on my non-operated side a bit just to give my back some relief.  I would say the worst parts of this are lack of independence, lack of sleep and feeling depressed (which is probably the post op/pre-menopause combo).
I will need to do my right hip next year and am not looking forward to starting this over again.

Hospital popped it back in and i was wearing a knee brace as it was caused by my knee bending. Again things are great but today when walking there is a grinding feeling in my thigh and my hip is sore. I am due pain killers so maybe thats the reason for the pain but im worried that this grinding is going to lead to another dislocation.

"My dr diagnosed bursitis. I was told that it would was due to 'overuse'. It can be quite sore but is not too bad, I just wish it wasn't there at all. Strangely mine hurts when I rest too much, which might seem like an easy fix but I am due another hip replacement on my left side and if I do too much it my hip that needs replacing absolutely kills me or locks up in complete protest. I am caught between the two.
What did you do to relieve bursitis? A lovely lady on here mentioned steroid shots, which I will do if it doesn't improve. Does anything else help?
I have been given anti inflammatories for now that give me a tummy ache and nausea so I have stopped them. It is not so bad really but I would like it to be resolved before my next surgery if possible.
Also anyone with any tips on second hip replacements I would be very happy to hear any suggestions

Overall the result has been very positive however I have quite severe Enesthopathy that gives me alot of groin pain. I am due for my other hip to be replaced in November and already have significant groin pain. Has anyone else experienced this and if so have you found anything to help? My surgeon has more or less told me that I am expecting to much and the pain is to be expected and will remain. He quoted some stats for people with severe back problems (which i also have ) who have had hip replacements saying enesthopathy is common in those patients.

"Hi! New to the board but hoping for some advice on 創ext steps as I was recently told I have arthritis in my right hip and it痴 basically bone-on-bone at this point. I知 46 and played basketball for most of my life and was running a couple of miles every other day as recently as three years ago. That痴 when I started having severe right knee pain and when it buckled on me while playing basketball with my kids I had it checked out and they found nothing (I was not having hip pain- all knee and upper leg). . I just kept telling myself it would go away even though it was painful to even put on my shoes and socks the knee would stiffen after standing or sitting for any length of time. It wasn稚 until a few months ago when I went for PT on my knee that I was told I have almost no mobility in my right hip and, long story short, I saw two docs who both told me I would need to do something fairly soon and they recommended I stop running (which I did anyway a couple of years ago and I致e gained 20 pounds- I know I need to do something like cycling or swimming but I think I知 still in denial). The second doc mentioned that I might be a 菟oster child for hip resurfacing. I sent my x-rays and info to a surgeon who specializes in resurfacing and now waiting to see if I am even a candidate. Anyone familiar with or had this procedure performed? My general physician told me to wait as long as I can before having surgery but that just seems odd that I would want to get to that point before doing anything. It痴 obviously only going to get worse since the cartilage is essentially gone. Thanks for any help you can offer!!

"Hello fellow hippies,this site has been a big support for me personally leading up to my surgery. At 6 days post op, I'm really surprised on how well I'm doing and how little pain.  I highly recommend anyone contemplating THR to go for it and if bilateral is an option for you, it's well worth considering. I don't want to jinx anything by being too braggadocios but I have yet to feel any pain from my LTHR and only slight healing pain from the RTHR. It's a much easier pain to endure that the previous bone on bone. I feel confident that I can reach my goal and return to surfing sometime next spring.  The hardest part for me is sleeping on my back.  Hope the offers encouragement to those that may be sitting on  the sidelines.  If anyone has specific questions about bilateral, let me know.  Kaiser originally told me the don't do bilateral however I'm living proof the can do it well.

What is becoming a major problem is a weak bladder!  If I could run even this would be a problem. I'm wondering if this is a coincidence, or somehow related to surgery?

Today was the first day I wasn't up for therapy, last night was a bit rough with almost no sleep and my leg muscles are very very sore. The pain is still much less than what I was feeling pre op so there is still a rainbow and birds singing Zippity Doo Dah !

"I'm day 25 post left hip replacement (posterior), and not due to see my surgeon until week 6. My sick note runs out on the same day, and I have found that I am already on the rota at work for the day before. I've only just graduated to one stick, and think I am walking with a limp, and certainly am nowhere near where I should be for a gruelling shift. Although I think I'm doing well, I'm not sure I will be up to x three 12 hour shifts a week. I am worried my surgeon will say 'you're fixed now, go back to work'. It seems Occupational Health want you back ASAP too. Whilst I don't want to malinger, I am anxious that if I go back too soon I will be off again, thus incurring more sick time. Does anyone have any idea as to how I should handle this? As a final note, getting a GP appointment is utterly impossible!

"I can't believe it, but I'm now 3 weeks post op!
This is my 2nd THR and it has gone way better than the first one.
I'm in minimal pain and I'm only using a walking stick when out and about and not even that around the house.  I am still using the crutches on the stairs but that is more because I'm still nervous about coming down.
I'm walking about 1 mile a day and I'm going to increase that as from today (weather permitting).
The wound is clean and dry but - as previously posted - I still have my stitches in as no one seems to be able to remove them!
I'm looking forward to being able to sleep on my side shortly - ooh that will be bliss.

Once I'm cleared to drive I am going to start exercising in earnest - first in the pool and then later in the gym.  I am looking forward to shifting the weight that seems to have piled on (I'm sure that each replacement joint must way at least 2 stone) and to regain my fitness level of a few years ago.
I have started working this week but I'm finding that I can't sit still for too long, so I have to keep getting up and moving about.  I just did a few hours on Monday and have gradually increased the time but I can't manage a full day yet.
I am so pleased with my progress so far and I thank my lucky stars that this op went better than the first one - it would have been a complete shock if it had been the other way round.  
So, to all of you out there that are just about to have the op done and wondering if its worth it, the answer is most definitely yes.  Once the op has been done, you can look forward to being able to start living again!

"Can it be, one year since beginning my TKR adventure. Thanks to a gifted surgeon and encouraging/kind forum comments from fellow TKR grads, I have attained a successful outcome. Fully able to enjoy all physical activities, with the exception of those that require running, jumping, or quick lateral movements. Stair climbing especially multiple flights are still challenging but doable. Kneeling will always feel strange, but that's OK. The following were very important with my recovery: proper nutrition and body weight; daily exercise (especially the days, you want to avoid it); sufficient rest/sleep, and, a can do attitude. Never, ever quit. Best wishes and the Lord's blessing to my fellow TRK classmates, on your journey to good health and pain free living.

"Hello everyone,
Click here to view image
I've been doing well except for the past two nights where my operated leg feels restless ( for lack of a better explanation) and feels numb and tingly whether I'm lying on my back or on my good side. If I get up & walk around the numbness goes away, but as soon as I lie back down, there it goes again!
I don't think I got more than 2 hours sleep the past 2 nights.
For some odd reason, this does not happen during the day if I lie down for a nap. I'm wondering if it's because I'm lying in bed too long at night? 
Your thoughts are much appreciated,
Betty

"I have been a member of this site for 4 years, ever since my first hip replacement in October 2013.
I have found it most helpful in my very long journey.
I would just like to relay my story and hopefully give hope to others out there.
As mentioned above, my first hip (left one) was replaced in October 2013. I wasn't sure at the time that they were replacing the worst one first, I had been having pain in both. During the next 12 months I was still suffering a lot of pain. After X rays etc it was decided to do a second operation, late October 2014. It was found that I had multiple adhesions. These were all separated and I felt no more pain in that leg.
In October 2016 I had the right hip replaced. On the 9thvJanuary this year I fell down outside of the physiotherapists office, suffering 3 fractures in my left ankle and 2 in my left wrist.
Cutting a very very long story short, I remained in constant pain in my new hip. I went back to my surgeon and X rays etc were again ordered. They could see I had a problem but couldn't identify it. He wanted me to have exploratory surgery on my new hip but I said no. I did go and have a second opinion but was not satisfied with that. I spent the next few months having intense physio and working in the gym in the physio centre to strengthen my muscles. All to no avail.
I was in so much pain and limited to what functions I could perform on a daily basis.
I again went back to my original surgeon and said okay lets do the exploratory surgery. I had this done 4 days ago. There were a few adhesions this time but also an enlarged bursa, which he removed but to my astonishment; there was a tendon that was not attached to the gluteus minimas.
I am now 4 days post op? I have no pain whatsoever, just a slight discomfort from the op.
The lesson I have drawn from this is, if you have a problem, to keep going back until you get answers and what are they going to do about it.
I am priveledged in that I live in Spain and I have had everything done privately.
I just hope this helps someone as much as some of the posts I have read, helped me.
Thank you

Had total right hip replacement Oct. 11 , anterior approach. So far I've been doing very well. Even though I know I will have my good days and bad days, I will keep reminding myself that I will continually get better. I am SO happy I had this done as I could see myself in a wheelchair down the road if I had not. 
Despite the pain and struggles that go along with recovery, it is not nearly as bad as how I felt before. I am looking forward to being ME again and not in chronic pain and feeling depressed. 
I've been reading posts this morning from some saying they still feel ""wooden"" and still can't bend to tie shoes, etc. That  is disheartening and one of the things I worried about pre-op, thinking what if I go through all this and still no big improvement afterward, but in the end I had no choice. If I had not done it, it would only get worse. 
I'm looking forward to sharing my journey with all of you lovely people, comparing notes, etc. and wish the best for those of you who are struggling.

"Had my post op review today (a bit early, at not quite 4 weeks) which surprised my surgeon, he initially thought that there was a problem. 
I reassured him that nothing was wrong, apart from the fact that I still had the stitches in as no one seemed to be able to remove them, and that it was just an early appointment.
He removed the stitches (with a bit of tugging) and then reminded me that most of the 6 week restrictions still applied.  However, I could start sleeping on my left side (the operated side) but not on my right side, which is ok by me as I prefer to sleep on my left side anyway.
I asked if I could drive, to which he initially said no, until I pointed out that I drove an automatic, then he changed his mind and said that I could.  Good news, as I live in a village with very limited public transport which is not accessible for me as I live at the bottom of a steep hill and the bus stop is at the top of the hill (of course it is)!
Yippee, now all I致e got to do is be good for the next 2 weeks until all the restrictions have gone and then start to exercise and lose this blasted weight!
Wish me luck!

"Hi everyone. We'll I am away on holiday in the sun. I was walking unaided with limp and with correct gait at 8 weeks.
Following advice from our wonderful Renee I booked special assistance at airport and brought a crutch with me. So glad I did. I've discovered that after walking for 10 minutes I really feel it in my hip. Still not limping but feel I would if I continued walking unaided so using my crutch when venturing further a field. Having assistance at the airports was gratefully received as i don't think I would have managed standing in queues and the long walk to the gate. Swimming is.......wonderful. Really starting to build up my muscles in the water. Even did aqua arobics class today and only missed out the ones where I would of put my leg in precarious positions. Hmmmmm breaststroke! !!! I just find it hard not to do it, although I am only doing vety gentle frog legs
One thing I would like to add. The knee on my operated leg is turning in quite badly and looks twisted. Doesn't hurt just looks odd. I seem to remember I was a little knock kneed in the past but not this bad. Has anybody else had this happen? I am seeing consultant a few days after my return from holiday so will raise it with him.

"So I'm not new to the hippie group. I had my right hip replaced on Jan. 4th 2017. To give an overview of my stroy, ex- military. Hurt my right hip in the military and found out I had dysplasia, labral tear with femoral impengement. But it took them six years to fix. I had my first right hip surgery December 17th 2015, this was a key hole surgery just to repair the tear and impengement. It only made things worse. I finally found a doctor willing to correct the deformity (hip dysplasia) with a replacement. The doctor told me when they went in that I was bone on bone with a lot of damage and deteroation and serve arthritis and it was a good thing we did a replacement, mind you I was only 33 at the time. So healed, no complication,went through physical therapy and strenght training because I had a lot of muscle atrophy. About four months into strenght training my left hip started to hurt and do the same thing my right was doing. I was devastated and heart broken, depressed, mad. How could this be happening? I am so young. was I over doing It? Did the six years of compensating caught up? I finally broke down and went back to my orthopedic doctor for my left hip now. And turns out I had dysplasia in that one too. That the socket was deformed. So he felt it best since I was expecting the same symptoms as my right to do another hip replacement. So my surgery was on October 4th of this year. So I offically have both replaced and I'm only 34. I know I can't compare surgeries. I know I can't be upset or mad, angry, depressed. I know I can't think that I'm starting over again and I defiantly can't feel sorry for myself or ask why me. I do hate hearing your so young... the doctor said I had bone on bone with deteroation and the start of arthritis and said it was much needed for this hip as well and felt he made the right choice by replacing that one to. I just hope I can now go on with my life and be pain free and be able to actually live life. I know one thing even thought I had an idea of what to expect, it still doesn't make it any easier. As of right now no complications, I hope it stays that way. To all thoes hippies recovery or facing a surgery you got this and we are strong.

"Four weeks post op, my left/operated leg is doing fine. I am mobile with one stick, able to do all the physio exercises, and very happy with progress.
However, approximately one week after the operation, I developed a painful lump behind the knee of my right leg. GP diagnosed on the phone: Baker's Cyst, not unusual due to uneven gait for some time prior to op. It should sort itself out without intervention.
Well, it hasn't. My leg has become more and more swollen (knee, calf, ankle, foot, toes), and when I saw GP 3 weeks post of, he prescribed very strong anti-inflammatories. They have not made a jot of a difference, and I spent yesterday afternoon in A&E. Everyone was puzzled, because it is happening to the 'wrong' leg. I was eventually sent home on Warfarin, just in case it turns out to be a DVT, with the aim to have a scan on Monday.
Does this ring any bells with anyone? I am uncomfortable and frustrated and would be grateful for advice.

"Hi, my second blood test for anaemia came back clear and hospital phoned me to say so a week ago. Hopefully I shouldn't have to wait too much longer now having had pre-assessment.  I had to stop taking the oral morphine due to severe constipation. It scared me so much I will never take it again. But my pain is so bad. Is there anything stronger than iboprufen 400mg with 2 paracetamols?  If not I might have to just put the morphine patches  back on (not the oral). I used to be able to slowly  walk across my lounge with the rollator but now the sharp pain in my groin has got so sharp it's like a red hot knife in there 24/7. All you hippies who've had that will know how agonising that pain is. If I sit for more than 5 minutes then try to stand up that pain gets to a 9 but what can you do when you can't walk either? It's a no-win.  I'd also like to know once the op is over and we're brought back to the ward, are we given bed pans or do we get up to use the loo? My goodness I can't imagine what it will be like to have no more pain. I think I'll buy some champagne and put a party notice on Facebook. Haha

"Hi,
I'm asking for your advice again as although I've had my pre-assessment so hopefully not much longer to wait, I'm hearing and feeling the most horrible bone clicking every time I try and walk now. Is it a good idea to keep walking? And my pain intensity yesterday prevented me from walking at all. Today it's a bit better but still very bad pain. Is it still sensible to try and walk even though you're in such bad pain? Yesterday frightened me to be honest as I was unable - for the first time ever - to put one foot in front of the other, even gripping onto my rollator, just to go across my living room to get to the kitchen. I don't know what is advisable and what is plain daft. Surely to just sit hour after hour can't be good for you?

"Morning hippies I'm now on day 6 post op. Posterior approach ceramic on plastic LTHR. I'm walking and exercising throughout the day then resting. My sister is here looking after me very well so I'm having delicious freshly cooked meals and all housework done. I'm catching up on my reading and having a good rest to help my recovery. She will be here to help for another week or so.  I was discharged from hospital on 2x panadol + 2 x Tramadol four times a day. They make me quite sleepy but I don't have much pain. I also elevate my leg and use ice packs as necessary. I am looking at starting to reduce the Tramadol by 1 per day from now as I am getting more mobile and don't think I need such a high level of pain management as immediately post op. So I have taken 1 Tramadol and 2 panadol at the 6 am dose. The rest I will take as usual. Tomorrow I will take 1 at 6 am and 1 at midday etc until I'm only taking panadol. I don't want to become dependent on Tramadol from overusing it now. I have my staples removed next Tuesday and start physio next Wednesday. I'm going to speak to my GP about this tomorrow but just wondering what people's real life experience of getting off Tramadol have been?

"Hi again all. After having my op cancelled in August I was worried to post anything about my new date in case I jinxed it. Anyway I had the procedure LTHR on 5th Oct and was discharged home yesterday (8 th Oct) in hospital I was getting a sudden sharp spasm like an electric shock through my thigh on the operated side at approx 01.00 hours. I would be given a little oromorph to help this. I was discharged home with Tramadol,paracetamol and gabapentine all of which so took as directed. I've had a couple of spasms during the day when I am drifting in or out of sleep. At 1 am I had the biggest spasm ever it felt like I had kicked the bed although I don't think I did. I phoned the ward and was advised to take 2 paracetamol now and 2 tramadol in 2 hours if I need them. I imagine this is all part of the healing process. Has anyone else had it and what were you prescribed for it?Many thanks. One amazing thing I've discovered is that my yoga classes have helped me to sleep well on my back. I was dreading that bit so that's such a nice surprise!

I put the 'u bend' at my head and use the sides to barricade myself into position and stop me rolling on to my side. I have experimented with and without an extra pillow and found that another pillow for my head puts me into a semi reclining position but that is comfortable enough to sleep.

i went to A&E 3 weeks ago with the pain and the doctor in the A&E was shocked when she seen the X-Ray she said there is no hip there at all she got the ortho consultant down to see me and he apologised and said that the reason I am still waiting is because my hip is a really complex hip and it requires two surgeons and they have to tie up a time were they are both free and they can get a theatre as the operation is going to take 6 hours plus. but he said it should only be another couple of weeks wait as my surgeon list was running at 24 weeks so I was really positive when I phoned today that they were going to say they had a date for me, I have spent the whole day crying as I don't know how much longer I can cope with the pain and being stuck in the house, I am losing the will to live.

"i am three weeks post THR and wondering at what stage it is safe to have sex again. 
At at the moment in bed I am sleeping on my back. I can't really lie on operated side as the wound is sore and lying on non operated side is discouraged as it pulls tendons. As such I haven't lay on my stomach at all yet. 
I am 42 and do have a high sex drive so the past three weeks have been very difficult. Sex is often a bit of a taboo subject but my view is it is very much a natural part of life and the lack of guidance from professionals is unhelpful. 
I have groin pain still when I exercise and have been told no flexion.  I am at home walking with no crutches although it is painful to do and I can't without limping. Longer walks I am using two crutches although this seems a bit self defeating as I am trying to avoid not putting weight on operated leg as I don't want the muscles to be underused and then walking on crutches putting weight through operated leg brings similar pain as with no crutches albeit not as quickly. 
My fear about sex is dislocation or doing any damage. I am male so obviously that makes is different than for ladies in terms of effect on muscles and the new hip I would imagine. 
I asked my physio and she point blank avoided the question and went a bit flustered which I found unhelpful really. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"i had TRHR July 27 and it went well and I was progressing nicely for 4 weeks or so when I started having groin pain and pain on the outside of my hip. Long story short, X-rays showed nothing but my surgeon put on total non weight bearing for 4 weeks, fearing a stress fracture ( they don稚 always show up on X-rays until they are healing). Looong 4 weeks but saw him last Friday and sure enough X-rays showed a stress fracture healing nicely with bone regrowth too. He cautiously let me ditch the wheelchair and,  using a walker,  put only 25% weight on that leg for 2 days, then 50% for two days and yesterday I could put full weight on it with no walker. I have zero hip pain! But, my knee on that operated leg is now painful. Anyone have an idea if it痴 because I have put weight on that leg for quite a while? Or any other ideas? We live in the US and are leaving October 9th for 2 weeks in Europe. I知 in a panic that after all this with my hip my knee is going to ruin the trip.

Due to my awful financial situation and awful insurance ($8K deductible - for which I'm already in hock $20K for two past foot operations from a diabetic foot ulcer) - I am thinking of waiting until I get a job with better insurance, and try for a hip operation about a year after a new job (I figure that won't ""hurt"" my employer).  Has anybody else been through this?  Can celebrex help you survive a year with bad hips?  It doesn't stop the pain and ""creakiness"" but I can at least function with one celebrex a day.....

"I had TRHR on September 21st of last year, so it's been almost 1 full year since my surgery.  Doing GREAT with the RH but I will be needing the other one done soon......kind of waiting till spring so that I might get into better shape, loose a little weight and be more REGULAR with my exercises etc.  
BUT...... the day after getting home from surgery last year I had a bout of A Fib that only lasted 5 minutes........a week later I had a bout that I had to be hospitalized for.  They took all kinds of tests as you can imagine and came to the conclusion that  my heart and lungs were A OK.  They put me on a blood pressure/ heart beat regulator and blood thinning medication that I am still on, and have never had another episode since.  But I am TERRIFIED of going through this again when I finally decide to have the other hip done.  All the Docs told me it had NOTHING to do with the surgery, but I am not buying that one for a second!  The cardiologist told me when I was ready for the other hip to be done, to come and see him a month prior, and he would put me on  a medication that would almost eliminate that problem, so that statement right there tells you he KNEW it had at least SOMETHING to do with the surgery.  My surgeon also told me that they know how to deal with A FIB so.....??  I guess my question is:  has anyone else ever had a bout with this after their surgery??  This, I am telling you was the WORST part of my hip surgery!

"I致e posted a couple of times recently after initially feeling so much better and then apparently starting to go backwards.  I visited my GP due to pain and he muttered words like 叢ossible revision needed but sent me back to my surgeon.  Today I finally had my appointment.  The pain in my thigh and knee has been caused by my prosthesis sinking further into the bone.  This has caused muscular pain (I don稚 remember nor could I pronounce the name of the muscle he mentioned) mainly because my operated leg has therefore shrunk in length which has affected my walking and to some extent balance.  My unoperated leg is now 1.5 - 2 cm longer than my other leg.  I now have to see the orthoptic department who will give (make) me a riser for my shoe so both legs are the same length.  My other hip does not need replacing but if and when it does he値l then sort it out.  This might help others in a similar situation but currently means no revisionary surgery is necessary - such a relief.  Apparently the muscle pain will go once my leg length is corrected via the heel riser in my shoes.  It will be removable so can be used in most of my shoes.  I hope this info helps others in a similar situation as I知 sure it痴 not just me.

"I am going on holiday soon and really looking forward to swimming every day. Only stroke I enjoy is breaststroke. I have been given no advice from surgeon or health care staff but have read on here and other places that we shouldn't do it after THR or in earlier stages. I will be 11 weeks post op when I get there.
I have come across a study that says that 100% of surgeons they contacted said it was ok as soon as wound was healed enough. Health care people only 17% said it was ok. They did research and couldn't find one dislocation resulting from swimming breaststroke. Their conclusion was that the muscles this stroke uses were the very ones we need strengthening and therefore this stroke should actually be encouraged not discouraged.
Would like to hear what fellow hippies:
1. have been told by and by who
2. have done when they've gone swimming.

"Well I've been caught unawares! Three days ago when I got up to start my day I was feeling a pain in my revised hip when walking that also affected my knee on the same side.
The pain seems to be in the muscles on the outside and around the back of the hip. It is also in the knee. It is not a sharp pain but it is making walking quite uncomfortable.
Over the last couple of weeks I have stopped my brisk walks. This is to try to extend the life of my total ankle replacement on the other side which is due to be revised in about a month.
I'm not aware of having done anything untoward in the days previous to this setback. I still have good movement in the hip joint but have stopped my exercises for the moment. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

"i know Christmas is a few months away but do have a question.
i had left hip replaced May 30 and because I've been in so much pain with my right hip, I saw the surgeon, had X-ray and I'm bone on bone. I'm using a walker once again and can hardly do anything, can't drive either. Of course it's having an effect on my operated hip, aches, etc because I'm relying on it more. I saw the surgeon again last week he actually said as I entered his office, ""I heard you coming"" that was all the crunching my bones were making. He said I had very severe arthritis and will need a replacement. Originally I was told it will take 8-10 months to have the surgery but yesterday the surgeon's office called and I will have surgery December 18. Yea!
i have always done the Christmas dinner for my family and that is my question: will I still be able to do it this year? I live alone but my granddaughter said she could come early in the day and help but I don't want to take any chances of dislocation. Should I just cancel the dinner this year or go ahead and do what I can?

"Hi All
I am nearly 10 weeks post op from posterior uncemented ceramic on ceramic.
I don't use crutches and have been pain free and walking without limp and with correct gait for some weeks. Recovery going really well.....except....
I retired early and admit I spend most of my time relaxing and seeing to our large veg garden which I have a 5 minute walk to. I have no problems or pain walking there, doing hoeing, grass cutting, weeding with long handled hoe, watering etc, and then walking home. There is a slight slope just near home and this sometimes pulls on my legs.
Anyway I decided to try some longer pure walking only. After 10 minutes it becomes a bit uncomfortable in my hip area, not very painful but twingey. If I stand and rest for a minute or so I can then walk quite far again before twinge comes back. It doesn't alter my walking gait just makes me feel tired and slows me down.
My question is.....is this normal? Is this one of the things why full recovery can take such a long time?

"Hi everyone,
I'm feeling pretty down at the moment, I was working as a cleaner up until January this year it got too difficult and I had to give it up, well fast forward to a LTHR at the end of June and to now, I felt like I had recovered enough to go back to work so I applied and got a job working as a deli assistant and I was over the moon!
So I started last week but what I didn't realise was that I would be doing prep work, this involves bending and lifting crates with food items in, I had help as it was my first day but realised at this point that I wouldn't be able to do it, however once serving at the counter I was fine, unfortunately I had to resign  the job because they needed me to be able to do all of it, and it's got me down.
At this stage I'm not sure what I should be able to do, I cannot squat fully and my muscles sometimes feel weak and tight, I do stretches and exercise but should I be feeling better/stronger in my legs by now as I'm 3 months post op?
I've got my CV sat on the side ready to start again, I still take paracetamol regularly so I know I'm not 100% and actually since that day I'm in a bit more discomfort than what I was, I've told my husband I will start actively looking for work in a couple of weeks as I don't want what happened to happen again, I don't know if I'm expecting too much of myself at this stage, i will be looking for more of a sedentary job but that isn't what I really want.

"Hi brave people out there, I have been following your posts for a long while. Thank you for sharing all that you have. After 3 years of having burning groin pain when walking, limping, not being able to walk and 3 years of repeatedly being sent to NHS physio for them to tell me nothing us wrong, just muscle weakness - when I struggled to lift my foot onto a footpath, I went private and in one week was told I had labrum tear, hip osteoarthritis both right and left, more pronounced in right. I was told I am a candidate for hip replacement now. That was aged 40. I have always been into fitness and being a yoga teacher, used to moving deeply into my body and hips.
My private physio told me to stop the yoga and work on strengthening exercises. Walking has improved but not reasonable distances, slow pace and am unable to carry any weight eg.light hand bag.
It's taken me a long while to come to terms with this but I have also dealt with it by stopping moving. I hardly move or go anywhere. It feels like life is over. Two years ago i went hiking climbing Scarfel Pike and the year before Snowdon. My physio who is very good told me to try and work with my natural hip for as long as I can due to risks of revision surgery.
My question is, with a fully functioning and well integrated hip replacement how does it feel and function differently to when your natural hip worked well with no issues? I would like to hear from everyone especially those around my age group and who are partake in sport and fitness.
Thank you and I wish you very well with your hip, movement and no pain.

I had a LTHR in October last year, all seemed to be going well until I started having back pain. My doctor sent me for an MRI and then I was seen by my hip consultant for my 6 month check up. She said I had facet joint arthritis in the lumper region, disc prolapse and possible sciatica. All these things where possibly made worse when my left leg was lengthened with the hip replacement. I was sent to see a spine surgeon who said I don稚 need an operation, and it doesn稚 look like any nerves are trapped.

"Hi all!
I'm having my TLH on Nov 13, my birthday. My surgeon is doing less surgeries now due to taking other duties so I had a choice of 2 days before year end. I had my TRH last Nov. 
Here it is about 6 weeks prior and I'm under a lot of stress. I am a cancer survivor as are another sister, my niece, and 2 brothers with prostate cancer. One of my brothers cancer returned and radiation did not help. Not it has mestastized to bones/lungs. Now waiting to see how 2 treatments of chemo do. Another sister has found a lump. Waiting on her results. And my doctors office called on Friday that my surgeon is leaving and his last surgery date is Nov 13, my surgery date. 
I have read if you are under stress when you do surgery it may take longer to heal, more chance of setbacks....and I don't know what to do. In 2 weeks I should know what my brother faces and how my sisters tests have shown. 
My last surgery was a breeze. Stayed 1 nite in hospital, no pain, off walker in 2 weeks and healed perfectly with no problems. 
Some people are telling me to do the surgery as my doctor will be gone. Another says do it as that's what my brother would want. With Doctor leaving is This is a sign that I should do it now? I can still have my surgery with one of his colleagues. He's got good reviews too. Only setback I start over on my deductible next year and right now I owe $1200 and everything else will be paid at 100%. 
Sorry for ranting but there is so much to consider. I don't know what to do. The one thing I know is that if my brothers treatment does not work I will in no way be able to do my surgery. 
For now I'm just afraid of doing it because of all the different stressful obstacles that have come up. 
Any suggestions or something to help me decide?

"Hi - I'm 51 years old and had hip labrum reconstruction in April 2017 that was unsuccessful.  My surgeon doesn't know why, but recommended total hip replacement.  I am going to get a second opinion on Thursday.  I've read in previous posts that if you only have mild arthristis (which is my case) that the Total hip replacement isn't very successful.  Does anyone know why? Has anyone had a THR with mild arthristis and it been successful?  Any other questions I should ask this surgeon on Thursday?
Thanks!

"Hi all
I've finally got a diagnosis for intermittent soreness around my new hip.  It's nice to be able to give it a name and have some idea how to treat it.  
I have got Ibuprofen gel for the time being, advised using ice and maybe a hydrocortisone injection into the bursa if it doesn't improve.
I would be interested in hearing from others who have had this and whether it ever went away.  I can bear it if I have to, nothing like the pain before my RTHR, but it would be nice to know what the future holds.  Doctor said it's not progressive so that's good news.

"Hi everyone! I'm new to the group and am reaching out for help and answers. I'm a 33 year old female who has had hip pain since my teen's. I've started asking doctors in my early 20's why I have these issues. Every response was that I was too overweight and need to loose weight. I eventually gave up and continued on with life dealing with the pain and limitations. When I turned 30 I noticed that the pain and discomfort was getting worse a lot more progressive and the limitations became a lot more extensive. I changed my diet and lost 100lbs in two years which did not change the way I felt at all. Then, at 33, I finally found a physician that actually cared and referred me to specialists to help me find the answers that I was looking for. Well, the answer was that I had severe Osteoarthritis in both hip joints and that I need a THR of both joints. I did not want to believe it at first but after going to another specialist to get a second opinion and getting the same answers while actually seeing my images and having them explained to me by the doctor it finally sank in that at 33 I am going to have to have both of my hips replaced. Of course I made the mistake of watching a youtube video of the procedure and working in the medical field it did not bother me as much as I thought it would.
Now my concerns and questions are as follows:
 1.) What kind of post-op recovery can I expect? This is what scares me the most. I am a very independent person and I hate being immobile and needing care for an extended period of time.
 2.) What kind of post-op complications (and with what type of implant) have you encountered since surgery? Is there really a big difference in the type of implant used?
 3.) Having gone through the surgery and recovery, knowing and experiencing what you have, would you have done it in the first place? Is there really an improvement in life activities?
Thanks for any and all advice that you may have for me. My anxiety about this whole ordeal is keeping me from making any kind of decision what so ever. All I know is that I don't want to live like this anymore.

"          I  really need your help with this new information ( please read SHOCKED if you haven't already)
Ok well lets call the three surgeons in question A B and C.
A is my original surgeon, the ""top dog"" , the most sought after at the hospital, takes the longest time in theatre and has a waiting list up to 30 weeks due to impressive recommendations. He spends ages on just one patient so isn't the quickest in theatre. He does around 2 to 3 ops a day. My surgery with him would take place next February/March at the earliest.
B has also been at the same hospital for a  long time, he is good too, but has a shorter waiting list due to the fact he is much quicker in theatre than A. He does about 6 ops a day. My pre assessment with him would be around the 20 week mark so about mid November for this and then maybe another month after for surgery.
C is the newbie, Consultant level, this hospital is his first post and he's just started builing up his patient list. He's been working for the past month in trauma A&E at  this hospital to familiarise himself with the theatre. He has a couple of hip operations booked for this week. He's spent 10 years as a registrar and has done around 3,000 ops on hip/knee. He has the shortest list. My pre assessment with him is already booked for  2 weeks time and surgery soon after if everything ok.
I got all the above information from the admissions secretary today. She siggested I come along for my pre assesment and meet him, ask as many questions as I need to and then go away and think about things. Apparently if I choose to not go with C, I would be put back onto A's list again and not lose my place or I can go with B.
My biggest concern is my level of pain. I'm wearing two morphine patches and take liquid morphine as well when I need it.  Also high strength iboprufen, paracetamol and amitriptiline. My friends all think I should get the op done as quickly as possible but none of them have had THR so I'd value your opinion very much.

"Hello again!  Since last I spoke, here are the updates.  After numerous tests, my Ortho said he felt that this was a spinal issue and not related to the hip.  Had a MRI of my lumbar spine which showed ""unusual"" things, but nothing drastic.  Had an EMG test (horrible) which said the same.  Met with Spinal surgeon, who after looking at everything, said this was a hip issue and not related to the spine.  So, back to the Ortho.  His response was that he was shocked to hear this.  He stated that we could do a total revision, but he didn't know if it would give me relief.  Several days later he sent me a message that stated that if I wanted to do this, we needed to get the ball rolling on it.  I asked him if we could move up my office visit (scheduled for the end of September) so that we could talk face to face.  The next message I received was that he put in the orders for the surgery.  My question is has anyone had success with a hip revision surgery?  I've heard good, I've heard bad.

"I have previously posted under a discussion of ""Failed hip arthroscopy, would hip replacement help"". Seeing as so many of you have gone through THR, I was wondering if anyone had a THR even though their cartilage was intact. I've been told by some surgeons that no surgeon would agree to do THR unless the cartilage is significantly damaged. I have had 3 hip arthroscopies but the surgeons can't seem to fully repair the labrum or finally get rid of scar tissue.

"hey all :-) hope you are all having a nice day. 
so all has been going well and iv dropped down to one crutch and as of last week the physio had said to try and get rid of both of them. so alls been going great. 
then yesterday i started getting what i can only describe as ""deep bone like pains""  feels nothing like muscular pains of which i have plenty in many strange shapes. my sleep has got worse as im waking stifer and probably a little sorer.  i do have Non axial Sponaliytis (ankolyising spondalytis in my pelvis and lower back instead of upper spine) 
My hope is that at 5 and a half weeks the space around the  metal shaft is filling with new bone my worst fear is that there is a bigger problem... the pain is not all the time im not aware of my hip at all most of the time then i get the odd deep twinge, perhaps about max 20 times in one day its only the odd one deep twinge or two at a time its not like its throbbing a lot. (thers one now lol) i guess it feels like a pulse of pain. 
has anyone experienced this? i currently have instructions to not bother foning the hospital with any quieries just to go straight there but im on my own and have no way to get there.

"Hi there,
I just wanted to offer a bit of inspiration to those who are on the start of their hippie journey. I had bilateral hip replacements a year ago, I'm 45 so a young un as the consultants would say..
Anyway, I've just done a HIIT session and managed to squat, widen my hips, brinv my knees up and all sorts of lovely movements I hadn't been able to do for years. Last weekend I managed to get a wetsuit on without holding onto someone, went snorkelling because I felt confident I'd be able to get on and off the boat and am now learning breaststroke legs in adult swimming lessons, something I have never ever managed. These may seem daft wee achievements but to me they mean the op was worth it, I can live a more active life with my kids without any pain killers.  
I am still the same person, I still lack motivation, worry that I might fall when hillwalking but it takes time to see yourself as having working fully functioning hips and changing my mentality. I no longer define myself or describe myself in terms of my osteoarthritis which is the loveliest part of it all. Best luck to everyone. I know this forum helped me soo much in my early days x

"I am in East Anglia and my GP wrote to my surgeon  three weeks ago to request an expedite for my THR as I've been in so much pain for nearly a year and the pain relief isn't working at all in the night. I'm 75, I've had children so I do know what acute pain feels like. At least you get a baby afterwards,but with this unrelenting pain you just pray for an early surgery date.
We heard nothing back from the hospital so I rang the surgeon's secretary myself this morning and she said she would phone me back once she'd found out what my surgeon was going to do. She said a lot of his patients liked him so much they only wanted him to do the surgery on their second hip and because of this the waiting list is going on for over 7 months from the time you're put on the list. I was put on the list in June so that would mean I wouldn't get a pre assessment until January/February of next year.
She phoned me back to say the surgeon had read my doctor's letter but he wasn't intending bringing my op forward. I was so upset when she said that, it was as if he didn't think my pain could be as bad as it is. I'm on liquid morphine, morphine patches, Amitriptyline anmd Naproxin. I can't walk at all now without a huge limp and quite honestly get no proper sleep whether I sleep on my back or my side. The relentless pain is always in my buttock and inner thigh/groin.
My Xray didn't look too bad when it was taken last February and I guess my surgeon is going on this. But even he said you get patients with very little damage but their pain is intolerable and you get patients with terrible looking hip joints and they never get much pain at all.
Has anyone on here had to wait around 8 months for their op? His secretary said there was a new consultant just starting there at the hospital and he wants to build up  his own patient list. She asked if I'd like to go on his list in which case I'd be seen in two weeks, meet him, and then have surgery. So I said yes. Now I'm a bit worried as he hasn't done hip ops at that hospital yet. The original surgeon's wait would be another few months ahead because he is so popular. What do you all think? Would you be operated on by someone this new? All i know is he's a consultant not a registrar.

"I'm wondering if anyone was in a similar situation and can provide some insight. About 3 years ago I had a total hip replacement. The first attempt was botched and they had to re-do the replacement about 6 weeks later. Because of the trauma of the two surgeries I was ordered on bed rest and was told NOT to exercise or do any physical therapy.
Well, now here we are 3 years later. I'm 50 lbs heavier and trying to get some sort of exercise plan started. I do low impact exercises and I start off VERY slow - need to build up my strength. It doesn't hurt while I'm working out. But the next day I'm in excruciating pain. The thigh muscle just aches all day. Sometimes there's stabbing pain. It throbs. Massaging or lightly beating the thigh helps temporarily. I have to start using a cane again just to get around. Sitting hurts. Standing hurts. Moving positions hurts. I can't sleep because it throbs all night.
Is anybody else not able to do any physical activities post surgery? Prior to the surgery I was a 40 year old ACTIVE mom of 3. Now I've pretty much been reduced to taking Ibuprofin and muscle relaxers if there's a visit to the grocery store on the agenda. This can't be normal right?
Side note - the first few times this happened I saw my surgeon who confirmed there's no loosening of the hardware. Another doctor did bloodwork, bone scans and radiographs to confirm there's no infection. It all appears to be a muscle issue.

"I am on my 7th day home after THR. My big request for the surgeon  was that my legs be the same length. I was released 28 hours after surgery and have been managing okay at home. My concern is that the incision is quite a bit longer than I had expected. (10-12 inches) It appears to be cemented and taped and looks to be healing well but I am having trouble with my foot turning inward. I have been working on walking and lying with it straight but it is painful in a 'mechanical' kind of way. Has anyone had experience with this? My leg looks like a geometrical grid with all the lines but I didn't see my surgeon before I was released so I'm confused as to what exactly happened. ( post op meeting in 2 weeks)

"I have had OA in my left hip for over 12 years and now my right hip is deteriorating. I work full time and only get pain intermittently but this is increasing. My hip locks if I sit on too low a chair  and does have some burning pain at night in bed. I have just had an opinion from a surgeon who says my left hip is dreadful. But he doesn't operate based on xrays but the patient reports of pain and disability etc. He empathized the risks of surgery and benefits so the ball is in my court as to when I am ready. My biggest issue is my limited range of movement eg I cant touch my left foot cut toenails etc. I can no longer ride my bike as it causes back pain now because my hip is so restricted. My GP never listened to me about my hip concerns because I don't take regular pain killers ( paracetamol doe nothing and ibuprofen gives me stomach ache after a few days). I am overweight and feel embarrassed by my size. My hope is to lose as much weight as I can in the next few months and then schedule surgery. What would people here recommend?

"I had left thr on August 30th (2 weeks and 2 days ago). My pt has been telling me that I am farther along than his other clients. This week he had me holding onto the top rail of our bannister and doing squats. After that, I had pain in the upper area of the incision. Right about where the bend is. So today we didn't do that exercise but instead he had a little peddle cycle thing. I was too tight and stiff to make it work at first but after some other exercises, I could finally do it forward and backward. However, now I am in my recliner unable to walk and taking pain meds. What do you all think of this? It never occurred to me to resist therapy. I have always done whatever they ask of me. This is my 2nd thr but I don't remember doing so many hard exercises this soon with my other replacement. Just curious if this is normal and I am being a big baby.

Fell off the diet wagon aka started eating real potatoes and too much red meat and bread and felt really lethargic so back on the diet wagon learnt my lesson. 
Physio- so yesterday i got discharged from the physio and told to ditch the crutches inside and use two outside then start wean myself to none almost immediately due to a previous history of mangled gait thanks to my daft brain (was kicked in head by a grumpy horse)  so thats good but because basically i know as much about physio as the physio does shes sent me on my merry way, which makes sense im holding a nhs space and id rather not and iv known this physio for about 15 years since i was a kid. 
so all good on that front, shes suggested since my ""taxi"" aka parents are on holiday for two weeks (thanks parents your leaving me to look after my grandad who got his let hip done the day after i got my right done... he wont do his exercises or go a walk.. hes wasting an opportunity)  basically to wait till iv had my post op assessment to go back to the pool and doing clams/ straight leg abductions but has suggested that i start doing my stnading exercises with a 2kg weight... 
right so heres the issue... my ankle is all the way down there! how am i supposed to put a 2kg weight around it? if im progressing well is it safe to start stretching a little more each day till i reach my ankles lol I read that people can by this stage drive put their shoes on and live normal lifes but im from a equine physio background and hte last 7 years have been hell i dont really want to risk dislocation and my understanding is that muscles ligaments tendons take time to tighten again. so obviously my head is saying... i should hold of from these 2kg ankle gymnastics but im walking unaided so surely my hip must have tightened up to allow me to do that painess (painless with calf knee and ankle  killer pains..)

I've found that although I was promised 'light duties' this has only happened when there are enough staff, and I have been back in the very physical side of things. I am now struggling quite a lot, but my bosses don't seem concerned and have given me rota up until the evening before the operation. Occupational health have made me feel like I'm getting an ingrown toenail removed rather than major surgery! Is it reasonable to say I need to finish now? Surely if phased return happens, is there no option for a phased finish. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

"Hello everyone, I am now 11 weeks post op and doing fine except I've now got trochanteric bursitis, I have been doing my exercises from the book I was given but I've had no physio and I'm not due to see my surgeon for another month. 
My question is has anyone else had/have this problem and what would be the best exercises to relieve this?
I will be very grateful for any suggestions, my hip is fine but I'm having to take pain relief for this as its very painful.
Thank you.

"I have been concerned about the idea of sleeping on my back ever since my pre-op.
I have not had my op yet, but I try every night - and I end up cheating every night :-(.
Just wondered whether a reclining deck-chair would be an option? It wouldn't be difficult to pad it out and make it comfortable for either daytime or night-time, and there is no temptation to roll over on either side.
Any thoughts anyone?

It can be a lonely place mentally recovering from hip surgery & in my case hip revision from a botched surgery 14 months ago.
I'm going well. I'm up to 30 mins walking a day, diligently do my rehab every day & get in 10,000 steps a day on my Fitbit.
I use my stick when I walk & take Panadol & Tramadol as needed.
I see surgeon again in 2 weeks. Fingers crossed all goes well.

I had my left thr on 10th August and things have been going really well - absolutely delighted except for 1 thing - scar pain.

"Hi everyone, I will be 5 weeks post op THR tomorrow and am getting increasingly frustrated. I have a good day where I am walking without crutches and with barely any limping, get myself all excited that I am well on the road to getting back to normal, and then I have 2-3 days where I can barely weight bear at all. 1 step forward and 2 steps back is how it feels, and I just wonder if this is normal and how long it goes on for? I am still having 1-2 hydrotherapy sessions a week.

"This is a story about a neighbour from thirty-five years ago where I previously lived, but still very valid if you are concerned about hip replacement surgery.
This farmer's age was under forty and he had been in some pain for many years and was told that he needed a total hip replacement, but for year after year he refused to have the surgery because he was terrified.
Being terrified is of course quite understandable so when some twenty years ago I had my new hip and was driving again the first visit I made was to this farmer to tell him of the success of my surgery and to try to reassure him that if I could do it at fifty-five and get my life back that he should have his done too.  I tried to encourage him for several years after this visit as he could see the ease I was getting on with my farming life and building projects but sadly it was to no avail.
Over the following twenty years his pain continued and his health went down hill steadily and it was just awful seeing him trying to cope.   Just getting in and out of his car or tractor was a terrible struggle and heaven knows the pain he was in, but from his face it was obvious that he was really suffering.   He could not walk and was totally dependent on others to do his shopping, banking etc. and being single it must have been very difficult.
Life continued to be very difficult for him and over time his hip became locked so too late to have the surgery he could have had over twenty years ago and had his life back.
Please, please everyone think very carefully if you are considering turning down the opportunity of hip replacement surgery.  The sooner you have this potentially life changing surgery the better if you are bone on bone.     I appreciate that it is scary having had one and now twenty years on having had a revision of it, both completely successful I'm delighted to say.
Cheers

"I am nearly 7 weeks post op. Was doing well as walking unaided and mostly doing usual stuff around house. Walking without pain and no limp.
Anyway the other day I lost my balance in garden and I was falling over onto non operated side so I allowed myself to fall rather than use operated leg to try and rebalanced. Thought that was best option in that split second. Of course I then had to work out how to get up !!!! Managed it sticking to 90 degree rule.
But since then I am getting spasms in groin, thigh and buttock again which had stopped. There is no real pain just a tingling sensation. I am still able to walk unaided and still not limping.
Question is I think I may have jolted muscles tendons etc and that's the sensation. If I had done any damage surely there would be pain? I am not keen on going to check it as seems petty considering only 6 weeks and likely to say symptoms usual at this stage. Any views?

"My Mum should have had her hip op done over 6 years ago.
She's put it off using lots of excuses and now she's at the point where she can't walk to the local shops so now has agreed with GP to have it done in 6 weeks time on the NHS and has her date and done all her pre-checks.
She lives on her own.  She is in a private landlord rental property.  It's a basement flat and she has no views on to the real world.  She has one window - which looks out on to a big bit of concrete.  The flat is not designed for an elderly person and the shower is not ideal as you need step up 1 big step - I would struggle and Mum does find it hard.  She wishes it was a ""wet room"" because I used to have one at my place so she knows what works for her.
Her kids don't live anywhere near her.  We all live away because of work commitments but we rally round when she needs us.
Hospital said that because me and my brothers showed up for her appointment - basically she's got peope to care for her so after her hip op they said we'd be responsible for her.  I explained we can't be there for her as we don't live in the area, but they said because we showed up for the appointment we are now responsible for after her hip op.
I'm looking at places where she can go to be looked after, after they sign her off after just a few days on the NHS.
I'm confused by all the stuff out there - even though we are happy to pay privately for her, it's not clear cut. Seems that there is no such thing as convalescent care out there.  It seems that everything has been privatised and so anyone wanting convalescent care will be in a nursing home / care home / respite care and potentially with patients who are dementia care paitients.
My Mum may be physically lacking but mentally - she's all there and has an active life.  I'm worried about putting her to convalescence in a place where she'll be talking to those with problems and dementia because thats what is on offer. 
She'll think we'll have put her there before her time.
I know you guys have done the convalescnet care things yourselves - what is your experience, where did you go, how did you chose your place and were you in there with people who were residents etc?
Thank you!

"Guys I know this is nothing to do with this hip forum but several kind people here have over the several months that I've been here have inquired about my impending ankle revision surgery.
Well at last after a lot of gentle pushing this afternoon I have been given a date for the pre. op Sept 29th., and the surgery is planned for October 29th.  
It will have been about a year since receiving the devastating news at my annual check-up that I had severe osteolysis in the bones where my ankle prosthesis was.  Since that time I have been to see several consultants and many discussions i various parts of the UK so I can hardly believe it that I've actually got some dates.
The surgery has many questions over it as the X rays show that there is only a slim chance that a revision will be successful and for the same reason converting to a fusion is also likely to be unsuccessful, but I have to go forward with as much optimism as possible.
All the best to all my friends here.

At 13 stone and only 5 ft 4 he wants me to lose 2 stone in the next 6 months before the op. Says as i didnt respond to steroid this cld cause probs post op making the case more complex in his experience as he observes links to higher risk infection when steroid hasnt worked.. i find it hard to lose weight tho and somewhat demoralised by this. Am menopausal so this aint easy! In pain lots and at work the other day got kicked in the hip by a patient. I have osteoporosis too. I cant go off sick long term as will lose pay and have two sons and a self emoloyed husband so money tight as y can imagine... husband really supportive.

"if there is such a thing.....
I'm scheduled to have my 2nd THR in 2 weeks and I was contemplating my navel (as you do) and remembering the issues I had last time.  One of my major bugbears was the fact that because I have a shower over the bath, I couldn't shower for 6 weeks (yuk) as with the restrictions I couldn't lift my leg up high enough to get into the bath.
So, I was wondering if there was such a thing as bath steps or something I could use to access the shower.

"Due for Posterior replacement on September 19. If your doctor says you need a new hip, but you think it will get better on its own, listen to the doctor. I didn't. I'm now walking with crutches all the time, can't turn over in bed, can hardly sit to go pee, and on and on. It's now bone on bone. Guess I thought I was gonna grow some new cartalidge in there or something. 
I'm 58 and extremely anxious about the surgery. I'm relatively confident that I will feel better than I do now, but the 90 degree thing really has me in a panic. 
Im thinking about taking up residence in a recliner for awhile after surgery. My husband has a tendency to wanna wrap his legs around mine when we sleep. Last thing I need is for him to yank it out of place. 
We we also have two small puppies who are approaching the terrible twos. Last thing I need is them jumping on me. I'm thinking I'll have more control in a chair. 
Im just apprehensive about the whole thing. My husband had a bilateral hip replacement about 10 years ago, so he thinks my recovery should be just like his. His surgery was anterior. He was home 23 hours later with new hips and back to work in two weeks. I know my recovery won't be like his. 
Going to the bathroom room is another whole discussion/worry. I don't wanna have to have someone wiping my butt because I'm in a panic I will screw up the 90 degree thing. 
Im sure I'm worrying about nothing, but the anxiety level increases daily!!  Reading your stories helps, but seems like there are a lot of dislocations...my greatest fear. 
So, for all you Posterior folks out there, any tricks and tips you wanna share?????
Thanks!!

"Oh hip replacement's no big deal today, they do hundreds every day. So after putting up with it for almost 10 years, I said ok lets get-r-done.
Well i'm just 4 weeks out from my THR and things weren't goin' to bad outside of some residual effects from surgery, but the hip was doin' ok. Doin' my PT stuff just like I was suppose to and layin' up on ice. Even though I'm a pretty impatient person, I was takin' it easy and not pushin' it.
But here comes Irma I'm in central Florida and all bets are off. Not time for healin' up right, gotta get sh*t ready to evac. Oh well, hopefully I won't wreck anything.
Ok, enough whinning.
My hip and leg seem to be doin' ok but I do have some concerns and wondering if these things are normal.
After I get movin' around in the morning, it ain't bad but initally really stiff and pain's pretty good, but any swelling's gone down.
Next after being up on it awhile it starts to swell up, my quad is really tight and can't bend my leg at my knee beyond 90 degs. Feels like all the muscles and tendons have all shrunk up. I seem to be havin' more trouble with my knee than anything, is any of this normal ? Will be seein' the doc in 3 weeks and will ask him about it all, but for right now and havin' to deal with a hurricane, gotta do what I gotta do.

I'm in East Anglia UK, I have seen both a hip surgeon and a spinal one but at the moment both are depressingly undecided whether this horrendous leg pain is coming from my hip or my spine. I don't get any ""grinding noise"" and no cervical issues but I can't walk at all some days. Today all the pain seems to be centered in one bit of my outer bum cheek. Don't get it here a lot but it's agony. I'm having to use a rollator to just get across my lounge!
I'm currently wearing 2 morphine patches - not helping- but after taking 400mg iboprufen, amitriptyline and paracetamol the pain lessens and I can sometimes walk alright. Those times are absolute heaven!!! 
I'm a normal weight and eat healthily but when groin/thigh pain is horrendous I can't get in or out of cars or onto a bed without physically lifting the leg nor can I lift that leg even a millimeter when lying flat. I can no longer manage to go up and down steps & I've learnt not to get anywhere near floor level because I just  can't get back up!  Sleeping? there is no way I can turn over unless I grip the bedsheets between my teeth to stifle the  crying out.  And in the night I get bad bi-lateral  shin/knee pain. Every bit of my pain disappears when I sit. And lessens considerably when I lean over a supermarket trolley.
Two years ago I had a lumbar MRI showing some spinal stenosis. A month ago I had 2nd Lumbar MRI.  I  had a hip Xray months ago which showed a marked less space inside one hip than the other and a bit of a bone spur. This coming Wednesday  I'm getting the results of this 2nd lumbar MRI and the following day I'm having a hip injection into the (groin??) - a day hospital admission. The hip surgeon I saw months ago suggested I had this before any THR  because, i quote, ""At least, if it works, we will know your pain is coming from your hip"". 
Both surgeons at the moment are undecided where exactly the leg pain is coming from. So your opinion would be most welcome please. Ive been in such bad pain for so long now it's as if I'll never get to the bottom of it so I'd really appreciate your own opinion going by what you yourself went through.I know you're not medically trained but just need to know if any of what I've written sounds familiar.
Many many thanks in advance,
Sarah.

Im worried that i'll go to surgery and the surgeon will open me up and see nothing wrong and sew me up again and then i'll still be left in agony with no reason for my pain.

"So I had a hip arthroscopy on a labral tear in my left hip done in December of last year. I went to physical therapy and followed all of my doctors instructions.  I was still in a lot of pain post operative.  I saw a neurologist and he sent me to pain management.  I had two injections in my spine, a sympathetic nerve block and an epidural nerve block.  
After those procedures failed to give me any relief, my doctor suggested I get an orthopedic second opinion.  I followed up with that and it turned out I had a second tear, adjacent to the first tear.  My company changed insurance plans, so no out of network providers.  After three and a half months of fighting with my insurance company (because no doctor would see me let alone touch me except for the original doctor), getting a case worker within the insurance company and contacting my local congressman, I finally got surgery approved.  
 My second surgery showed that there was scar tissue around the original sutures, so the doctor said I healed too well.  He removed the scar tissue and shaved the bone down so that the issue wouldn't happen again.  
He did say that he fully believes that I have nerve damage in my back, they had given me medication to knock me out, and they rolled me over for the epidural.  When they stuck me with the needle I cried out in pain and and as still sensitive to the touch even when I was out cold.  
Has anyone had any of this????
The second surgery and the nerve damage???  I am slowly recovering but I worry about the nerve damage.

"I'm a 42 year old male been having hip problems for 8-10 years.  I played lots of basketball in high school and played golf 2 or 3 x a week never remember injuring my hip.  Went for my first MRI of hip probably in 08 or 09.  Said looked normal nothing wrong no arthritis.  I went on another year or 2 was still bad went for another MRI a year or 2 later.  Still nothing was disappointing but went on another 2 or so years did a lot of reading came up I had a Labral tear and read MRI basically useless to diagnose them unless they use the dye or contrast so with my instructions they did.  So after 3 or 4 MRI along with couple injections in the joint over this 5-7 year period  I had a labral tear had it repaired in Nashville tn dr byrd supposed to be one of the best.  After surgery discussed with him he said I had a lot going on but he cleaned out my bone spurs and I had fai impingement along with my labrum had calcified.  Said he did his best but didn't sound promising I may have had some relief maybe a month or 2 but then bam back same as before 6 months later this was appx 3 years ago.  I went appx 1 year ago trying to tell doctors what I needed in Lexington Ky this doesn't go over too well bruise a lot of egos along the way.  I met with my first doctors he mentioned arthroscopic I bluntly said I tried that I need a new hip he said it's minimal arthritis blah blah so went to a different doctor there in the group 1 time appx 1 year ago he suggested open it up try to fix what need fixing but no thr I wasn't excited about that .  So wait another year until appx 2 weeks ago meet with same dr in lex thinking be same thing put it off more pain etc.  after looking at my X-rays he said is your quality of life bad I said it's terrible for a 42 year old used to be active this was on a Thursday he says I have an opening for next wed to do thr do you want to do it.  I was shocked not ready but knew he takes months to get into always heard good things.  So here I am 1.5 weeks post op of my left hip thr so far so good still sore but hopefully the surgery will be a success sorry so long

"I live in UK and had RTHR 5.5 weeks ago. While in hospital for 2 days I was only told to wiggle my foot now and then for blood flow.
On discharge PT just checked I could use toilet stairs etc and signed me off. Lady in next bed had knee surgery and she spent ages with her going through exercise she needed to do. I was told nothing. As I was reading on here people having (in some cases!!!)4hrs a day PT I began to wonder if I had been overlooked.
Further investigation online I found it said our hip and muscles mend themselves and only exercise needed was walking and.......more walking. I checked with hospital and they confirmed this.
Anyway from reading posts I wondered why the difference and decided to do the initial ones that seem standard everywhere on the net. Only did these a few times and now seem to have more painful muscles than before.
I have been walking unaided inside and short distances outside and use crutches for longer walks. Doing really well good gait and pain free. Last few days since doing the exercises I have tingling shooting pains in my leg on and off as I walk. I am also far more stiff after sitting than before. Whilst not too painful I feel it is getting worse not better.
Beginning to wonder if hospital were right and that just walking is enough for good recovery.Any thoughts?

Pain is bad so they're talking option of revision.  I have MS and use a wheelchair so my risk of dislocation is very high which is why I didn't get a THR in first place.  Nothing can be done immediately as it's too soon since the first op. but are there any implants that are less likely to dislocate than others even if they offer less mobility.

"I finally decided to use a bed again after nearly 11 weeks post op.  Last night (my second night in the bed) I rolled over at an odd angle and could feel the fake hip inside of me if that makes any sense.  The metallic feeling felt very strange...and the pain that came along with it wasn't so hot either.  Has anyone else experienced/felt this?  And, if so, does the hip every feel normal when you lay on it? 
Thanks,

"My surgery was on Valentines Day so almost 3 wks ago. I had the anterior approach. Since day of surgery that leg had been numb. I can walk fine with my walker and my hip feels great but I am not able to lift that leg to climb into bed for example,or even drive as I can't move from brake to gas pedal. My surgeon said he had never had a patient have this problem and feels maybe the numbing medicine the gave me during surgery, my body over reacted. He just seems to think it's a waiting game. Has this ever happened to anyone. The numbness has disapated some and my skin is sensitive and tingly and as of yesterday after doing my excercises my muscles started twitching above my knee and the back of my leg. The twitching doest hurt just feels funny. I would love to hear similar circumstances as I am the first one for my Dr.

"I was put on the waiting list for hip surgery at the start of June 2017. I contacted the Nuffield orthopaedic hospital Oxford 6 weeks later and was told it would be likely that my surgery would not happen until the end of the year, that sounds awfully long. Does any one have information on current waiting times in this area?. Constantly being woken up with pain at night and I have to get up at 4:20 am so I get little sleep so a potential 6-7 month wait is depressing. I would be very grateful for any info on waiting times.

"Hello Hippies.
Thanks to some really good replies to my previous post and members other posts I goggle some information.
It seems that our IT BAND goes from our hip down outer side of leg, crosses over the knee and then down the shin. Overuse, particularly with repetitive movement, causes tingling along these areas. If we ignore and continue doing too much then it tightens and gets inflamed and becomes really painful for which the only solution is 3 weeks of rest, ice, elevation and simple stretch exercises.
This explains a lot to me. As I've been feeling so good I've been hoeing weeds and other various jobs at allotment. Going to take it easier and yes it does suguest doing stretches to help build the strength in the ITband.
Thought this may be of interest to some of you.

"Hi folks
I am hoping someone might have the same problem and able to releive my worry that something isnt right. Had right hip replaced 13 weeks ago. A hybrid joint with uncemented cup and cemented stem. Posterior. My recovery has been good though not as good as some I read about, but everyone different in recovery. I dont use crutches indoors or nipping to shops but longer walks use one. No painkillers from 10 days. Amazing. I had a childhood hip problem and was a but shorter on bad side since 12. Then over last 2 years and a years wait my muscles were really weak and even shorter than was. Anyway about 12 days ago I felt a niggle starting to walk. After few steps it disappeared. It has got steadily worse, and its almost as bad first few steps as before op. But still resolves after few steps. Outside of my thigh is tender..not directly over scar.mid thigh.and an ouch spot on side above knee. And for first time in weeks I woke up few times with same pain releived when shifted. Does it sound muscular, tendon rather than new hip itself.

"Hello everyone! 
I just had my 6 week follow-up with my OS and couldn't have gotten a better report card. X-Rays show a good 40 deg. acetabular socket angle and mobility is very good in all directions. I've been cleared for all activities (except running) with pain as my guide. Scar is nice and clean as well. I got rid of my walking aids (cane) about a week ago and have been walking 4-5 miles per day and a week ago I increased my workouts to include the elliptical trainer for 20 minutes every other day as well as some abductor/adductor work. I'm also cleared for swimming! Looking forward to that! I don't mean to brag but am just so happy that my life is getting back to my pre-hip pain days. I was so very active and am getting back to that again. I live to surf! I know some of you are doing great, some not so great and everyone else somewhere in between. There is light at the end of the tunnel and it's the light of life. You will get there, I'm a firm believer in that so keep thinking positive and make sure you do your PT! It's most important!
Best of luck to all!

"hey guys :-) first time iv ever posted a discussion but iv been following this site for a long time, it really helped me pre op make choices. 
So basically everything has been going really well, my leg was badly rotated pre op with the knee about a 45 degree angle inwards, that has been fixed during the op so iv gone through tones of muscle groaning days. I still have a large muscle ball at the top of the wound where it was obviously clamped open and one at the bottom. 
I have internal dissolvable sutures that i believe was one long piece knotted on the way down but not clipped. I was awake and only slightly sedated - the spinal anesthesia wore off quite a bit towards end so i could feel a part of the end of the op and all the sutures lol
I have started spitting sutures, there is one directly under where the top knot will be, which is fully out, the wound appears to be happily sealed tho no gaps or leakage at any time, and i have a few further down i can just feel in the scar line.
I have non- axial spondalytis (ankolysising spondalitis but mostly affects my pelvis and the lower spine) so i take a anti- tnf called Etanercept  once ever week which is why im worried. 
Has anyone experienced spitting sutures? do i need to fone up the surgical nurse to deal with it (i have a ocd specialist surgeon  with strict guidelines who scares half the nurses on the ward) do i just leave it and see what happens or do i clip both sides of it carefully to prevent pulling the whole line? 
any help would be so lovely ! thanks and sorry for the ramble!!

"Hi Hippies,
Further to my last post. I saw the surgeon again last week.
I am five months post op and following on from an incident with my dogs have developed tightness , pain and numbness around the top of my leg groin area and also a lot of pain in my lower back and left buttock.
Had three X-rays all of which looked fine. To be honest I felt as if none of them believed I was in pain!! Outcome is I now have to go for a CT scan to see if I have any tiny bone fractures. 
I just hope they can find a reason for this because I am at the end of my tether with it. I have been told to go back on my crutches also and it feels like a massive step backwards.
Looking online as you do to find out reasons there seems to be a few people suffer this with no apparent reason or remedy.
Any ideas??

"hello, 
i am almost 52, was in a car accident in march , MRI arthrogram confirms I have torn labrum in a few areas as well as osteoarthritis. I am now off work because of the horrible pain and difficulty doing the basics such as going up stairs, putting on socks,bending etc in addition to difficulty sleeping. the specialist told me that I am too young for hip replacement and he doubts another specialist who deals with torn labrum would do surgery on me to repair it because it is not a clean tear and I also have arthritis. He said I may just have to live with it! I am in constant pain, can't babysit my granddaughter, have to now apply for disability through work. There has to be a better answer than this! He stated that he would try an injection to see if it is the hip labrum or arthritis that is actually causing me pain. If it is arthritis he can just keep doing injections. However, I am positive it is torn labrum causing me pain due to the clicking and lockin and my hip pain only started after my car accident.  Help !! Why can't I get a replacement and how on earth am I just just suppose to live with this? I asked the specialist ""what am i supposed to do about work? He stated ""I don't know""

"I have several issues, but I think they may all be related to anesthesia. I was told that I would have a spinal block with twilight sleep. Instead, when I was finally able to wake up I found out that I had a general anesthesia. Why would they do that? My surgery was early in the morning, but I remained in recovery longer than usual. Later in the day, when they tried to get me up to standing I was too weak, dizzy, nauseous and tired, so I slept for the remainder of the day and all the following night. On Wednesday I found out that I had been suffering from heart arrhythmia and I could not go home until I had a magnesium drip. I also have to follow up with a heart doctor.
So, here it is Friday. I do not have hip pain and walking with my walker is not an issue. I have been doing physical therapy which, as minor as it is, continues to exhaust me. I'm constipated, despite the use of prune juice, Milk of Magnesia, coffee, Miralax, water, and a bowl of chili last night! Blood pressure has remained elevated. And I'm wondering why I have three incisions - one on my left hip, one on the side of my left knee, and a smaller one (two staples) on my right hip. Did the surgeon start on the wrong side?
So can the anesthesia be the cause of elevated blood pressure, continued exhaustion, and this darn constipation? And would it have caused heart arrythmia? I've never been diagnosed with any heart problems before and my blood pressure has been under great control for years.
I should be happy that I do not have pain, swelling, or bruising.

"I had one hip replacement in 2013. I had bone against bone on both hips. I had the left one done first. I was ecstatic about having the other one done because it went very well. I didn't have much pain at all after the healing process. Before I could get back to have the other one done my mom developed dementia. She went down fast and our whole family pitched in to keep her out of a nursing home. The Doctor that did my first surgery retired. He referred me to another doctor that was supposed to be as good as him. During the consult with this doctor he told me that he had a new procedure that was less invasive and it would be faster healing. I asked this doctor would it be the same as the other one. He said yes. I said are you sure? He reassured me that it would be great. The first doctor went in from the side. This other doctor went in from the front of my thigh. I knew from the first week that something was wrong. I had the reference from the other hip surgery. Since April 29 of 2015 I have been in so much pain. One leg is shorter than the other and left me with a deep limp. I can't walk without my walker because the pain gets so much worse. I'm experiencing sharp pain in the upper thigh area and the pain is getting worse everyday. But let them tell it I'm fine. If i don't take the pain meds I'm bed bound. Smh what can I do? Also the second doctor put screws everywhere. Please share anything you can to help. Thank u.

I have a terrific wife who will be my rock but I have simple questions like, how long will I be in the hospital and will I be able to go upstairs to my bedroom when I return home?  Thank anyone in advance for suggestions on where I could go to get answers to some of my basic questions.

"An elderly relative of mine will have the operation soon. Her son wants to know if and how soon he will be able to move his mother via his car to his home in another area of the country. The doctors say she must sit at 90%, so I'm not sure if it would be okay for her to travel in a car for 1.5 to 2 hours. Perhaps he could wrap padding of some sort around the seatback to make it as close to 90% as possible. Incidentally, she is in her 80's.

"Hi - I am 69 & 10 months out from THR.  The thigh pain started about 2 months ago.   An appt with my surgeon was not available until next week. However, 10 days ago, my thigh started having excruciating pain to the point I was unable to put any weight on my leg.   Went to the ER - had X-rays, ultrasound of my leg & a cat scan. Everything checked out fine. Even after 2 shots of morphine - still was unable to put weight on my leg.  After the morphine kicked in - they would not let me leave until I was able to support myself with a walker. My niece took me home & I used the walker for a couple days & my leg was better but the thigh pain (tolerable) is still there.  Any suggestions?  Thank you.

"Morning fellow hippies.   Today we are in a flash flood warning.   After having no rain for awhile and very high temps.  Today I wanted to ask has anyone had a colonoscopy since their hip replacement?  I'm scheduled to have one on the 18th of August.  My surgeon said just to be sure to have pillow between my legs  during procedure and gave me a prescription of 4 amoxicillin pills to take before the procedure!!  I thought that was a bit too much. My family thinks I should wait another 6 months to a year before I have one being that the last one I had my knee got messed up after the procedure and hasn't been the same.  I'm scared for my hip as y'all know I dislocated my first hip replacement and had to a total hip revision 3 weeks later.   Thanks.

The would looks very good, although longer than I thought! 
The Nurse has said to keep the dressing off unless it starts to 'weep'. 
However, my incision has internal stitches and outer skin glue. I now have an irrational fear that the wound is going to open. I wanted to ask if anyone else has had this type of skin closure and if there's anything I should do to alleviate any problems.

"Well l have the story that started at a hip replacement and has just took over my life and had nothing but bad luck since it started.
Before l had my 1st hip replacement and just thought l had pulled a muscle in my groin. I drove 4hrs to get to York from Scotland only for my hip to go really bad. I felt like l was being stabbed inside my leg, the pain was unbearable. I arrived there at night time and hardly slept because of the pain. I am allergic to asprin so could not take any NSAIDs. I had the choice of paracetamol. But when l got up in the morning l was in tears on the floor trying to put my jeans on. My husband seen how much pain l was in and said right this can't go on. Do you want to go to a hospital or what do you want me to do. At this point l just wanted home and my husband does not drive, but all l wanted was to get home to my own house. So we checked out after 1 night even though we had paid for the 4 nights. I was just determined l could drive the journey home and did. I was at the doctors the next day, they sent me to the hospital for xrays. Four days later l got a call from the doctors to go see them.
Thats when l found out l needed both hips replaced as they were both totally bone to bone and fragment of bone were broken. It was a total shock ! Me and my husband were outdoor folk and walked everynight about 7 miles. We loved to walk. That was in December 2015 and l had my 1st hip replaced. Next one done in Feb 2016. Since then Ostioarthritis has took over my life. I have it in both knee's so far l have had 1 replaced in Aug 2016 then when recovering from that my ankle got it and the pain was worse than my knee that still needed done. So had an ankle fusion in April this year which was a simple operation but had the worse recovery as l had to wear a cast non weight bearing for 3 weeks. Then l was changed to a moonboot which l thought would be better.......l was wrong it was so heavy and l had to wear a really thick sock underneath it again being non weight bearing for 6 weeks and had to wear it in bed. Then another 5 weeks weight bearing with moonboot. I was really low for that recovery. I got it off and my foot has not felt great since.
I wonder to myself why have l had such bad luck since l turned 42....l am now 44 and in desperate need for the knee replacement but my mum got cancer and l had to delay it as she was going through treatment. Sadly my mum died last Thursday after being told she was cured, but never really got over the hard radio and chemothearapy. She suffered from anxiety and the fear she still had it. We all tried our hardest to convince her she was imagining it she had a year of wasted life as she was never the same again for the full year. She kept saying she had lumps in her kneck and a sore sholder. The doctor said she was fine. But it turns out she was right all along and the cancer had just spread everywear. I am now grieving the loss of my mum and in severe pain in my knee. I am taking the strongest painkillers you can get as l had to get past my mums funeral. I am now having a break before l start again with the knee.
I think why me my life has been awful since the end of 2015 and its just got worse. I hate OA its wasted me having any sort of normal life. I have even had to give up my position in the job l had and go part time even though l have hardly been at work the last few years. I just wonder if l will ever be in no pain.
Right now l am grieving and l am so mixed up and feel heartbroken.
But life has to go on and my OA will go on as well. Even though there is no link to why l have it in nearly ever joint in my bottom half. I just think what happened to me to end up like this at 44.
Sorry for the long doom and gloom post l just felt l had to get it out as this forum was a godsend for me when l 1st had my hip replacement.

"If this lengthy I do apologize.   I am at wits end on how to deal with this.   I went to the Dr. about 4 years ago with the complaint of groin pain.   She recommended physical therapy which helped a bit.   Over the years the groin pain continued to get worse, traveling to by hip and down my leg.  Last November, I was told after an MRI that I needed a THR.   The MRI showed wearing of the cartilage in the hip, bone spurs and cysts in the joint.   I had a couple of friends that had the anterior hip replacement and were please with the results.   The problem is that I had to lose about 70 lbs. to get it done.  We moved to another state and I proceeded to set up getting the work done.   The Dr. I found said that I also needed to lose the weight and referred me to a bariatric program.   With the bariatric program, I have lost 55 lbs.   I was  also told by the Orthopedic Dr. that I need to get a panniculectomy (removal of the lose skin) that would be in the surgical area to reduce the risk of infection.    I was asked by the bariatric Dr. to follow up with the Orthopedic Dr. as I am close to where I need to be and he is doing the required panniculectomy surgery next week.  I also alerted the Nurse of the Orthopedic Dr. and she said she consulted with him and I needed 6-8 weeks after the panniculectomy procedure before he would do the hip replacement.  
She told me to schedule with their department and I had a date.  
Two days ago, I followed up with the Ortho Dr., at the recommendation of my other Dr.'s and he acted like I should not bother him as yet as I have not reached the goal weight he set.   He cited the need to be at a certain BMI to reduced the risk of infection.   He would not discuss my pain medication, which at this point is one tramadol in the morning and two at bedtime.  He said I should talk to my family Dr., who actually said I should talk to my Orthopedic Dr.  After waiting 1 hr. and 45 minutes to see him in the office he could not offer me anything.  I suffer constant pain, I can only sleep on my back, I am using a cane to get around and not sure what I can do.   I definitely plan to get the weight off to get the surgery but an really upset about the attitude of the Dr.   He has stellar reviews online but an not sure about his bedside manner.   I would appreciate any suggestions on what I might do to relieve some of the pain, any exercising that might help (as most is pretty painful) and any insight anyone might have to get through this period.   I will definitely work on the weight loss issue as I have to get this done.   The sooner the better.     Thanks You-

"I went to see Dr Brian F. Kavanagh in ONS, Greenwich, CT, US.  Is anyone here familiar with him?   He took x-ray and told me I will need THR for both hips in the near future.  This came to me as a surprise, as my HIP pain is not that severe, I thought I have Hip bursitis as I have difficulty to get on/off my bicycle, also, have difficulty to put on my socks, and get in to my car, etc.
I am a recreational cyclist, during the cycling season (April-Sept), I cycle around 4 days a week.  I would like to get some advise if I need to reduce the amount of cycling before the surgery or not.   What are your advises regarding the Must-Do Pre-Op Exercises Before the Hip Replacement Surgery?
The current plan is, early next year, do surgery for one hip first, once recovered, do another. 
Any advise you can offer is appreciated.  I did obtain the laymans guide to Total Hip Replacement from Rocketman54 which is very very helpful.

"Hey ya'll,
Well this is my first time actually participating in a forum and along with a place to research answers to questions, appears to be quite a wailing wall, so here goes.
I'm just 14 days out from my THR (R/S) and having many issues. My first and probably the most difficult is I'm an extremely independent person and having to rely on another for the most simplest of things is rubbing me the wrong way. Next is I've been having alot of trouble with my gut due to all the meds pumped into me at the hospital and then home. After some adjustment of the home meds I'm finally gettin' the train to run right but still having the gut issues that's lookin' to be an ulcer. And because of the over concentration about my gut, attention to healing my hip is takin' a back seat.
My life revolves around outside, I hunt, fish, and own and ride horses, the later bein' the primary and the whole reason for doin' this 'cause I couldn't ride anymore. I also play bass in a rock n roll band and all this adds up to gettin' back on my feet asap.
So as I said in the beginning, this appears to kinda bein' a wailin' wall and a way to talk to others that might be in the same boat.
Thanks for readin'.

"I'm wondering how many other people have had to have THRs in later life following being born with congenital dislocation of the hip?  I believe that this is not the same as dysplasia but may be similar. 
I was born in 1953 and at age 18 months was discovered to have CDH on both sides with the left hip socket being virtually non-existant.  This had shown up because I was not walking properly and was dragging my left leg.  I was then put into 'frog' plaster for 18 months followed by leg irons until I was nearly 4.  I suffered pain in both legs, couldn't run and walked with a limp all my life until at age 40 both hips joints disintegrated to bone on bone.  By this time I was walking with a stick and on cold, damp days couldn't get out of bed.  In the meantime, however I had had two children born naturally (my OS couldn't believe it when I told him!!!)when I was in my 20s.
Anyway, when I was 40 I had both hips replaced - 11 weeks apart and after that my life changed so much.  I was able to walk for miles, climb hills, dance, wear incredibly high heels(!) - all the things I hadn't been able to do for 40 years! 
So, I've now had 20 years' of all that but in July this year, after rock'n'rollin all night at my daugher's wedding, my right hip decided to disintegrate and I had the revision just four weeks ago.  I'm hoping that once I've recovered from this I'll be able to enjoy life just as much as I did before.
I'd be interested to hear anyone else's stories of CDH.
Thanks for listening,

Primarily when I sit, or stand following sitting; the pain is so bad that I can barely stand for a few moments.

"Morning all,
I just thought I would update you as to how I'm getting on. 
I had my first outpatient physio appointment yesterday afternoon, which went really well. She felt that I'm probably doing too much and reminded me that I have just had major surgery, but it's very difficult as other than not sleeping, I do feel so well. She watched me walk on my crutches and the only thing to change is that I need to slow down and straighten up when I'm walking. She said that after the years of pain in my hip, the tendency is to lean forward as you are trying to alleviate the pain in your hip. I now have to re-train myself to stand tall and walk straight looking ahead. 
I am booked in for two hydrotherapy sessions next week, and the following week. I then have a land physio appointment to see how I'm getting on. Looking forward to hydrotherapy, and hopefully I will be able to get back to aqua aerobics soon too.

"Hi,
4 weeks ago I had an MRI scan of the hip (it's hurt for well over a year now) and it showed up a burstitis and suspect bits and pieces. I went to a great hip man at St John and Elizabeths in London who sent me off for an Xray who said my hip was 6/10 bad for osteoarthritis and at age 45 it would be invevitable for me to have to have a THR. (spurs either side, flattened bone and a nice big cyst -osteocyte?) He said MRIs are not as good as Xray for picking up osteoarthritis and the bursitis was wrongly read.
He said how soon it is done depends on how much pain I can take. All a bit of a shock.
Obviously I am in pain, some days worse than others to the point of being unbearable. I find paracetamol and nurofen dont really do that much (nurofen limited time you can take it, takes 4 hours to work anyway) and I would have to take paracetamol all day every day to dull the deep aching.
The specialist sent me off for the xray guided steroid injection saying that it could help me for 2 minutes or 2 years. I had it on tueday (6 days ago), it hurt like hell on the wednesday, I had about 5 hours of relief on the sunday, but today after a gentle gym session it hurts still, especially down the front of my leg. It's a different type of ache to the pre injection ache, but now my knee is hurting...I have about 10% more movement from my hip, but it has not been the success I wanted it to be.
What does this mean?
(My hip hurt all of last winter, didnt hurt in the summer for 3 months, and now is horrid again.)
If anyone can help me that would be great. I have MS (in remission) on top of this so am a bit annoyed with my body at the moment!!
Too much to take in, and I really would like to know other people's experience - am I off my rocker to be even entertaining a THR in the next 6 months.

"How much say did you have in choice of prosthesis? Just wondering if your surgeon gave you a choice in the matter or if they decided which would be the best for you? For various reasons I have not yet seen my surgeon, just one of his team and we didn't discuss replacement at that point. . The surgeon wrote and told me I need a THR after reviewing my MRI which was done elsewhere. I was expecting to see him to discuss what he had found and get his recommendation but it has ended up that I will only see him on the day of the surgery. I am in a lot of pain and just want this sorted and I guess if I had injured my hip in a car accident or something I would perhaps only see the surgeon after the operation had been carried out. The surgeon is reputable and very experienced, it's been more of an admin problem that has caused this. I could postpone the op and demand to see him but that prolongs my pain and causes problems with having someone to stay with me post op which is all arranged now. There aren't any operation appointments until the end of October if I don't go ahead this week. Just feeling anxious and under pressure. I have decided that if I feel very uncomfortable with him when I do meet him I can always walk out. I did send him a list of questions by email via his secretary but haven't heard back. I rang the hospital today as I had no reply from the secretary and they are chasing this up for me. Was discussion about the surgical approach, prosthesis type and lifestyle expectations something that you had in advance or were you just given a new hip? Not having had anything like this before I don't know what I should expect. What questions did you ask or wish you had asked? 
Thanks

"I had my first THR in June 2016 (2nd THR is next month) and the result was good - I can walk ok and I'm no longer in pain, so the op should be considered as a success.
However, my new hip didn't feel quite right. I have tried to explain to other people how it felt and failed quite miserably because all I could say was that it just didn't feel right; it was if I could almost 'feel' that there was something foreign in my hip/leg and it didn't feel part of me.  Unfortunately, a very poor description and no real help to anyone trying to understand what I meant (including me)!
On Saturday, I was changing the bed and doing those funny sideways steps you only use when changing the bed, when my new hip suddenly 'clicked' and then it felt 'right'.  There was no pain with the 'click', just a kind of relief.  Now my new hip feels wonderful!
So, I've no idea why it didn't feel right in the first place and I've no idea what 'clicked' and why - I just know that I'm dead chuffed with the result!
If anyone has any ideas on this, I would be pleased to hear them.

"Hello, again, fellow hipsters.
So as to a followup to my journey,  1 year 3 months of complaints of feeling tightness, tourniquet feeling in my thigh, pinching sensation in my groin upon movement and discomfort when raising my knee up from standing or sitting or lying down from my groin, down my thig,  all the way to my kneecap,   I finally insisted that my surgeon look at the soft tissues to see if he sees anything wrong because I should be feeling more mobility and laxity in my thigh and knee on movement after hip replacement and I am always conscious of the extreme tightness and discomfort.
And it seems there are finally some answers  to my  complaints and that is that on MRI on the surgical side they found that my cup is impinging on the anterior capsule.  
I hardly want to do a revision to reposition the cup.  My surgeon is downplaying this saying he's not too worried about it but he's not feeling the constant discomfort on mobility that I am living with.  So I'm thinking that this probably explains why I have been feeling discomfort from the getgo.  
Now the problem is I need to have hip replacement on the other side really soon.  This time, I'm thinking maybe anterior approach may be better with a better and shorter recovery.  
I can't get a second opinion from anyone on  this impingement  or if anyone thinks this is going to be an even bigger problem in the long run that will cause premature wear on the device if it's rubbing wrong.  They all say,  ""Ask your surgeon and see what he says,""  instead of giving me an objective opinion.  
But certainly I do have to live with a lot of discomfort in many of my movements but not sure if it's enough discomfort to do it all over again.
I think I have to address the other side first because that hip has become really problematic.   I knew they used a long stem the first go round.  Maybe I'd feel better if the doctor used a shorter stem with the anterior approach but my surgeon doesn't think shorter stems last as long in the long run, cause fracturing and nerve problems that the posterior approach doesn't present.
All I know is I have to make a decision soon because the other side is problematic now and feeling so confused.  
Has anyone ever heard of impingement after hip replacement?
Mine is the cup impinging on the anterior capsule.  My surgeon says this kind of impingement is not the problematic kind of impingement.  But he doesn't seem to grasp how it affects me in day to day living and movement.
Appreciate, once again, any thoughts on this.
Best regards to all my fellow hipsters.
Hugs to all for all the support.

"Hi All:  New here and happy to find some real life experiences.  I fell 12 weeks ago and didn't learn until 3 weeks later than I had fractured my hip.  Doc says it is a ""non-displaced fracture.""  What he didn't tell me is the top of the femur is now jammed up into the socket, with a resulting at least 1/2"" (sorry, I'm in the U.S. - don't know metric!) short leg on the fractured side.  I was doing well until in therapy they put me on a stationary bike - that set me back about 3 weeks and I'm just getting back to where I was.  I continue, however, to have horrible pain in my groin, like someone is shoving a sharp stick up inside my leg.  The pain has been so bad that I haven't been able to do my exercises in physical therapy 2 out of the last 3 times I went.  Now I'm hearing ""If you're not getting better you probably need surgery.""  I really don't want surgery and I'm already going batty from being home for 3 months, can't imagine dealing with this all over again for another 3 months, although I realize if I do nothing I do continue to heal.  Had a good day today so I did my exercises, now I am preventatively sitting on an ice pack.  Anyone else out there who did NOT have surgery and still having pain at 12 weeks?  I appreciate everyone's comments, you all give me hope!
                                                                                                          ~ Janet

"Hi. I am 3 weeks post op and feeling pretty pleased with my progues up to now almost to the point of probably getting a bit cocky about my abilities. This morning however my next door neighbour who had THR 6 months ago dislocated her hip simply bending down to put her sock on which she's been doing for a while now. Watching her in pain and being whisked off to hospital has reminded me that we ALWAYS need to be extra vigilant even as we improve. Take care everybody and stay safe.

"I have two Birmingham Hip Resurfacings (BHR), the first 13 years ago, aged 33 the next 8 years ago. The newest one has been hurting & I have just been advised that for some reason BHR's were not very success in women, but do tend to be in men, typical that I am a woman!!
The metal rubs together & you can end up with some debris, which rubs away at the tissue & the hip moves, which mine has done. My blood test show that I do have high levels of metal. I believe a lot of women were called back for yearly blood tests, unfortunately I was missed off this list. 
I've been advised the only solution is a full hip replacement & I wondered if anyone else has gone through this?
Many thanks

"Hi
Just back from my 7 week post thr operation (anterior approach) check up and have been given the all clear to resume all activities except running which he said I could try after 6 months.  I'm fine to fly long and short haul, return to gym, cycling, swimming (including breastroke).  I asked him why there was such variability on advice about what can and can't be done post operation.  He said it comes down to the health of the patient, the complexity of the surgery and the personal view of the consultant.  I'm next due to see him on the anniversary of the surgery, the seven year anniversary and thereafter every three years.  
This discussion group has been an invaluable source of advice and moral support both before and after surgery so thanks to everyone helping me get here and look forward to staying connected through this group.

"A couple of months ago, I posted that I was disappointed to report that I needed a 2nd THR and was in the process of having a major sulk at the time.  I received lots of support and understanding, for which I thank everyone who replied.
I haven't been sulking for 2 months - honest - but I have been dreading receiving 'that envelope', which duly arrived this week.
'That envelope' also gave me the date for my pre-op - next week, in fact.  I was a little surprised about this as by my calculations its 5 weeks in advance of the op.
Has anyone else had their pre-op so far in advance?

"Hi, I read on here about someone who was nervously awaiting a porter to take her to theatre for a THR without a general anaesthetic. I can't find that particular thread so just asking if anyone has had it done with just an epidural and what it was like? I'm one of those people who gets very anxious when not in control. Trying to wake up properly from a general anaesthetic leaves me very anxious and my pulse rate is very fast until I gain control and can keep my eyes open. I've had this phobia for decades so it's not going to change now. If anyone can give me their own experiences of their epidural THR I would love to hear from you. Thank you.

"Hopefully someone can give advice.  I'm 71 years old and was quite healthy beforehand.  Up until about three weeks ago I was recovering well from my surgery in mid April.  I am now abroad with my husband looking after my  three grandchildren (twin girls of 9 and nearly 5 year old boy) .  I'm finding it more and more difficult to stand up from sitting as the pain in the front of my thigh makes it so difficult.  It takes a while to start walking as I'm so stiff and sleeping is now becoming uncomfortable.  Once up and walking I'm not too bad but I get extremely tired.  My husband is coping well, particularly as they're his step grandchildren, but I feel so useless as it hurts to do almost everything.  I'm back on paracetamol quite regularly now.  Why am I getting worse?  I'm sure it's not the children so would welcome any suggestions.  My daughter and her husband arrive in 48 hours so we'll hopefully be doing a bit less but have 2 more weeks with them all.

"I am so glad I found this discussion forum.  I am 2 weeks post op from RTHR with cementless ceramic on ceramic.  I am doing ok.  Day after op I was got out of bed and used frame to get to toilet etc.  Next morning Doc and nurse came to my bed and said medically I was signed off and just needed physio to do the same.  Physio arrived soon after and introduced me to my crutches and watched me to go bathroom and get on and off toilet, walk down corridor and up and down 4 steps, sit in chair and get on and off bed.  She then said all OK and I was discharged there and then.  My only follow up is at 14 weeks post op with consultant.  Consultant was brilliant and scar is disolving stitches and very tidy.  Swelling now gone down.  A couple of days ago I discovered that I was walking fairly normally and not putting my wieght on crutches.  I tried without and can amanage around the house for a short time.  Still use them outside.  Have reduced to one crutch inside house just for security and balance.  Athough in pain I never used any aid before my op, just persevered.  My pain level is now very low and just have a minor ache in thigh after doing things.  Sleeping on back is problematic and have slept on un-operated side with pillow between legs last few nights for a short while although leg does ache from this.  I am not wanting to rush this recovery but my body seems to be ok with what I am doing.  I am just wondering if I am doing too much too soon though.  It is difficult having had no excercises given or instructions except for the 90 degree, no twisting and no turning foot of operated leg inwards restrictions.

"Hi ,I am back and in pain once again, only this time it's my left hip.
My surgery is Oct. 4 and I can't wait .
This pain is relentless.
I try to be active everyday I go to the gym at least 4 days a week . I have two toddlers I attend to a few times a week so I am busy..
I am 4 months post op from my right hip replacement and the movement and strength are returning, however my scar is still sensitive on the bottom. I use oils to massage it but still sore to the touch.
People tell me I know what to expect with the second one ,and I gotta tell ya it wasn't a joy ride for me. I ended up back in the hospital with a spinal headache after suffering for almost 2weeks.. nobody ever said that could happen from a spinal. I ended up having a blood patch done , which was God sent,the headache stopped and I could start to heal.
My question is my upper thigh on my left leg and my knee are more painful then the hip itself? ??, I didn't have that type of pain on my right side is this common with hip pain?
Thanks for the rant.. getting nervous again.

"Had a hip op 6 weeks ago. Encountering a few foot issues whilst trying to walk and it transpires that one leg is about 7mm shorter than the other......operated leg short. I have tested this with varying thickness of paper under my foot to see what is comfortable to stand on and then putting a corresponding spacer in my shoe. The podiatrist was a little useless but my basic efforts actually make a tremendous improvement to outer foot pain and hip discomfort

Firstly, when should I be ok to sleep on my operated side? I have tried to lay on it briefly and feel comfortable and as far I can tell my hip is gaining strength as expected.
Secondly, when are we able to drive once more? Do we have to wait for the go ahead from said surgeon? Do we need permission in writing? Again I feel ready and definitely in need of getting back into the driving seat. What do insurance companies require to ensure full cover?

"Hi all. Well, six months ago today I had my hip replaced. What a journey. All in all it has gone really well. My surgery was done with the hip version of a spinal which was great. I remember nothing after being wheeled into the operating room, until I woke up in recovery. I was sitting a chair the afternoon after surgery. From the time I left home the morning of surgery, I was back home in 33 hours! I was walking in the house unaided by day 4. Discharged from formal PT after five weeks. Felt great at my six week checkup with my surgeon. Then as some of you know, I quit doing my home exercises cuz I felt so good & was back to most of my daily activities, i.e., walking dogs, gardening, playing golf.... Well, that was a mistake. Now at 6 months out, I still do them, & feel it if I don't. I still feel weather changes, although not as bad. I guess the ""new"" hip will always feel different from my ""real"" one. One thing I really wish I had done was to keep a journal of my activities & how I felt. At least for me, it got a bit blurry remembering how I felt at 2, 6, 12 weeks etc. A journal would have helped me with that. To those of you considering THR, my comment is don't wait. Life is so much better on the other side.

I needed two Steroid injections in the last two years and it is not sorted out completely, guess, I am still healing up there in that regard, but is so much better than it was and I do have pain, but far less now six months after my second injection, and is controlled with two 50mg Trammies, when I need them, they allow me to walk normally and thus exercise the joint in the correct manner, a work still in progress. 
)  It was quite a climb 480 steps... I sat at the top for an hour and performed a few memorable five and ten minute sessions of Tai chi, as the platform at the top is a square observation point; being square, lends itself ideally to Taichi practice. 
I was warned by the owner of the cafe at the foot of the climb to be careful on the way down, more than on the way up. So true of all of us, after our operations, not to overdo it, and to be glad that we are recovering after over taxing ourselves.
The coffee and breakfast in the cafe after the descent, was most welcome and refreshing.

"Hi Hippies,
Had a total left hip replacement in cemented twelve weeks ago. I was doing great . Was back to walking dogs and everything I had done previously. Gardening etc. Surgeon was happy and didn't want to see me for another year.
We were out walking dogs last week. They were off lead and my partner was messing around with them. I had my back to them. Two of the dogs Apr and backwards and crashed full pelt into the back of my leg. It really hurt but I seemed to walk it off.
Since then however I can not lift my leg whilst sitting or being my knee up in front of me whilst standing. Getting in and out of car is a total nightmare because it is so painful. And turning over at night likewise.
My leg seems numb when I wake in the morning and I am limping.
Was checked out at doctors and they are referring me back to the surgeon but they seemed happy my hip was still in place. They said I might have dislodged the shaft down my leg which will still be forming new bone.
Has anybody any ideas or suffered with similar?. I am so fed up.

"Hi folks
i had my left hip replaced May 30 everything is great on that side except for a twinge once and a while. I posted previously that my surgeon has told me my right hip will need to be replaced as it is bone on bone osteoarthritis already. I found out that the wait time for this surgery is 8 to 10 months here in Ontario Canada. I have an appointment with my surgeon on August 28 and at that time will register for the surgery and ask that I be placed on a cancellation list as well as the regular surgery list. 
I had my last physio session but I have been continuing doing the exercises at home, usually every day twice a day but sometimes only once a day. My problem is although I still have to use my cane to walk, I now have to switch sides as my right side is so painful. I'm only taking Tylenol for Arthritis 3 times a day plus Meloxicam once a day no narcotics. I'm still having lots of pain and find it difficult to walk even with the cane.
I know I'm going on about this but to be honest, I don't know how I can get through 10 months of constant pain. My surgeon wants me off any narcotics so won't renew prescription. Any suggestions as to how I can survive the very long wait?
thanks for any help

Or could this be tendonitis, a pinched nerve, or possible an extension of a UTI infection?  No pain when I first wake up, but the pain increases over the day with activities such as walking, getting up and down from a chair, etc.

"Hey guys! 
Haven't been on here for a while but wanted some advice on the pain I've been getting the past few days.
I'm exactly 1 year post op after having a THR on my left hip and about 3 days ago I got out of my car quite awkwardly and think I twisted my leg abit too much...the day after I was in quite abit of pain when I walked and moved certain ways so I rested for a day and thought it had gone but then today it seems to be back.
It's kind of a ache/pain in my hip and knee area and I'm just worried that I've done something or if this is the start of me having pain regularly now? 
I was very lucky when I had the surgery as I had pretty much no pain afterwards so I think that's why this is concerning me
If anyone can put my mind at rest or give me any advice I would much appreciate it!

"I had my left hip replaced 14 months ago. I recovered, have been very active ( I just got back from 10 days wilderness kayaking and camping) but have the following problem. If I stretch my leg and hip by bending forward a lot or climbing stairs or hills I notice a slight pulling pain and weakness in the upper rear of my hip and side of my glutes. I also notice what I would describe as a ""crackling"" feeling when I walk. I wonder if it is in the scar tissue as the actual replaced hip seems ok. I have also noticed that I do not have the strength back in my hips when it comes to climbing even though I do bikes, treadmill and leg exercises at the gym. When I climb stairs I often have to use the handrail to help pull me up. If I am standing around sometimes my hip area feels ""tired"". I am a 68 year old female. I will talk to my chiropracter and gym instructor about more strengthening exercises, but wondered if others have similar experiences.

I went to urgent care was told I had wax build up but no infection and all that needed done was for them to get wax out. They did it I could hear better .they told me to get some drops over the counter that would help to get rid of the wax. I left feeling good
Not much pain unless I touched the skin at opening of ear. Was told pain would soon go away but as the night went on the pain got worse and pain med don't even help. Do you think since I just have pain and no infection I can still have surgery. Cause pain in hip is really pad and I can hardly walk.

I have found a local convalescent home that specialises in post op recovery and offers twice daily Physio and hydrotherapy. How soon does hydrotherapy usually start? I can't imagine it would be within a week of leaving hospital. Anyway, did anyone go to convalescence after leaving hospital? Would you recommend it? I live alone but my sister may be able to come and stay for a while. Just wondering what challenges I'm likely to face if I'm on my own in case she can't come. Also did you manage to get into an ordinary car or taxi after you left hospital or do you need specialist transport home?

"Yesterday I noticed my leg ankle swelling badly around the ankle bone. No noticeable pain except leg above that area has extreme sensitivity upon touch, other then that it does not have more noticeably pain. I might mention. I had a quick healing hip with little pain until I started outpatient P.T. and I had TKR on the same leg one year ago. The knee was healed well enough to walk and do most things normally without pain, but my stamina was low. I had slow healing on the knee but was doing well when I had hip surgery. I am 70 years young but had been fairly inactive for a few years because of knee and hip pain.  I was elated with my easy quick hip surgery. I had mini-posterior. I got through my restrictions and had in home PT. I was walking in the house without my cane, only using the cane when leaving the house because my other knee still needs replacement and causes me pain. Well 2 weeks into a gradual outpatient PT program, I am getting knee or at least a lot of pain around the replaced knee. Every morning when I wake up the pain is so bad on my knee areas that I can barely walk!  After a pain pill (I had stopped them weeks ago but need them again), I gradually can shower and dress for the day. I used the walker (put away after my 2nd week) today. I noticed last night my left ankle was badly swollen (same leg as hip and knee replacements). I put my big gel ice pack down my left leg from knee to ankle. This morning the ankle was down ever so slightly, but still swollen. Walking is still hard. I should mention on Sunday we went to my daughters house and I went up and down a full set of stairs for the first time since surgery. PT is working me, but very gradually and he is careful. It is the same therapist I had for my knee and he is good. Today (Monday) I cancelled my PT for today and Wednesday. My thinking is I just need to rest in my recliner with my kegs up and ice them a few times a day. Question?  Has anyone here had anything like this happen at 10 weeks post op? Also have they had their ankle swell after hip replacement? I am very confused about this. I rarely ever have swelling, I had no ankle swelling after knee replacement and one day of swelling after my hip, so this is perplexing. I am on my feet more, have been going grocery shopping etc. we do have hard tile floors but I always wear my shoes for support (Merrells). I am worried something else is going on.

"Hi everyone 
i would like some advice please .
well here I am again now. Finally had my 8 month post hip op check and all good. Fit to get back to a life at last after months of recovering. 
Definately took me much longer than I had expected, I have only really been feeling myself for the last month .
Dr says it's ok to use the gym so I went along today . The only problem is it's very limiting what I can actually do as dr said I still have to not let my knee go over 90 degrees as my hip is just pinned and not cemented so could dislocate if I do breach the 90 degree rule. 
I thought I would be fine on the lie back bike for sure ,but then when I sat on it and tried to peddle my legs went up so high I am sure it would break the 90 degree angle precaution so I stopped and only went on the cross trainer and treadmill. 
I have since arrived home and been thinking ,is it really breaking the rule as your laid back ?? But it did feel like my leg stopped and I would of had to push it beyond that point.
There is no way I can get down to do the rowers either plus I am sure that's what made my hip get much worse before I even had the hip op a year ago. 
Any fellow hippy go to the gym and can give me some advice please. 
Many thanks.

However, I keep reading about people suffering nerve damage following hip surgery, especially with the anterior method. I had asked the surgeon about this and he said that he had a couple of patients with prolonged numbness, but he did not seem to think that it was any big deal.

"I just had LTHR a week ago and have a concern. Before the surgery, when I was always limping around in pain, there were times when I felt like someone kneed me right in the thigh. It was a deep muscle pain that would dissipate as I walked. The Ortho surgeon said it was just how an arthritic hip can sometimes manifest pain. Well, I had the surgery a week ago and now I have that same pain constantly. Once again, it dissipates a bit when I walk but does not go away. It's lower than the prosthetic stem and goes all the way down almost to my knee on the front of the thigh. Very tender and sore. Is this normal and will it fade as time passes?

"Hi.. New here, so bear with me.  After limping into my Ortho's office in March of '14 I found out that I somehow fractured the ball on my left femur leading to a total hip replacement.  In '15 I found out that I developed heterotropic ossification in the left hip, and it was surgically removed.  Same thing in '16, but this time we threw in some radiation treatment to prevent the trifecta.  Now in '17.. Left hipp pain back more than ever.  MRI shows no fractures or loosening of the stem, but it does show a ""moderate"" amount of fluid around the hip implant.  My ortho did blood work to rule out metal wear and gout (both negative), and now on Monday I get fluid drained for testing.  My ortho said this didn't look good.  Has anyone else had anything like this?  Does anyone know why would there be anyother reason for that much fluid around a hip implant?  I'm kind of freaking out here, because I also have a left knee total replacement and if it is infection I'm worried it's next.
Thank you.

"Interesting development!  I am about 11 weeks post op TRHR.  All is going well.  Hip is healing and lower back issues are getting better.  However, I have all of a sudden been diagnosed with eczema!  I have a few patches on arms and neck, but most is on my face around my eyes!  Red and puffy eyes!  Exzema seems to be ""linked to an overactive response by the body's immune system to an irritant"".  Is the new hip the ""irritant""?  Has anyone else experienced a new rash or something else attacking while your immune system might be compromised while healing?

"Hi Hippies.
I am now 3 months post op for a left thr . Anterior approach non cemented ceramic.
I was fine at first, seemed to be doing great but now I have a strange numbness around the incision and my groin and down the front of my leg to my knee. I can only discribe it as feeling as if somebody has put a tight elastic band around the top of my leg.
Has anyone else suffered this.
I'm not in pain during the day but it's most uncomfortable on a night and I am unable to lie on operated side as it is to painful.

"Hi Fellow Hippie group, 
i am stryggling at at the moment , six months since my second THR age 57 as I was born with congenital dislocated hips or dysplastic hips as it's now called. Anyway my walking is shocking , need crutches outside and today just been in a very small department store, using the trolley to go round, and now the pain is awful . I am still on morphine and zapain. I had no physio but after seeing consultant last week going into hospital for intensive inpatient physio . Today I am now feeling very sorry for myself , I just have no stanima and do have pain the minute my body decides It's had enough. I have not returned yet to work , but will need to do so shortly , I work part time and have planned a gradual return to work but after today's small activity I am so worried about it. 
Maybe it's the six month dip but can't believe how upset it has made me. 
Thanks Kay

"Hi everybody, I am a 51 year old woman, 13 weeks post-op from right THR. I was doing really well until 3 weeks ago when I started suffering groin pain and extreme pain in my upper thigh and bottom. The pain was so bad I had to start using my crutches again and after sitting for more than 20 minutes I'm  in agony. Went to hospital today for xray and saw specialist nurse. She thinks it is soft tissue inflammation in the bursa pad and surrounding muscle. She is referring me back to surgeon but it is a 5 week wait for an appointment.
Has anybody else suffered from this and is so what treatment options are available?

"hi fellow hippies
i had my left hip replaced May 30 stem moved a bit but since it has stayed stable and everything is healing as it should. Went to see surgeon on Friday and he told me he was pleased with my progress although I'm still using a cane. I've been doing physio once a week and home exercises every day. Next week is my last outside physio but I will continue the exercises at home.
i asked the surgeon if the pain and aches I was having in my right leg was from exercises or arthritis I also told him about the crunches I feel in that leg. He sent me back for X-ray and confirmed I have arthritis in my right hip that is already bone on bone. No wonder I've been having so much pain. No wonder  my progress to walking without cane is slow. Pain is holding me back.
i have to see him in four weeks but at least I won't have to wait months to see him like the last time. I will have to wait a long time for surgery as wait times here in Ontario Canada are quite long.
i hate the idea of going through all this again but know there will be no pain after my next surgery. Well unless my knees need replacing too! I pray that will not be the case.
i feel bad that my wonderful granddaughter will have to be tied down for another six to eight weeks driving me to physio, dr appointments, doing groceries,etc. But she says she doesn't mind. I'm 78 and live alone so need her help.
All this when I finally can drive myself now and some of those 90 degree restrictions have been relaxed (posterior surgery) I've got to start all over again. At least I know what to expect now and have all the necessary equipment to help me.
ill post again after my next visit to the surgeon, hope I can get a surgery date soon.
good luck to all recovering hippies.

As you know we are measured before surgery to find out our ideal sitting height. Mine is 181/2 inches. Before I left hospital the PT put some tape around one of my curtches with the exact 181/2 inches measured from the bottom end of the crutch to the bottom of the tape. It is so useful to me when I am out and about as I can put my crutches against a chair to make sure it's not to low. Hope this is helpful to some of you. Thanks for reading, x

"Hello everyone,
This is my first post and I don't know where or how to start.
Well I was only 19 when I started feeling this uncomfortable pain in my hip so I had to abandon my career as a football player (soccer) because I couldn't bare the pain after training.
I went see my doctor, he had me go for a scan it came back and he requested more. He wrote me up for scan, X-ray, MRI and whatever there is to see what was really going as he didn't believe the first result.
He was pretty sad when the results came in, he told me this is my current situation and that I should quit playing soccer, and put me on diclofenac if I couldn't bare the pain.
At that point I was pretty damn young to actually think I was in a F'd situation, I kept going the pain didn't stop me. Had to eventually quit working because I had to stand 8hrs as a factory worker. Fast forward 2017 I barely got enough sleep I'm not able to take walks with my friends, became pretty immobile; well as for the pain I don't have to describe as you guys already know.
Got tired of the pain and my life in general, surgery at 27 not just any surgery but having your bone cut off from your waist side and replaced with foreign objects wow !
I got very emotional the day of the surgery and I'm telling you I'm a very tough African kid I don't break but I cried, the doctors were really sweet.
I had a general anesthesia, I guess hearing my bones cut off and been pulled out of me made me panic and my pressure dropped, that's a story for another day.
Now I'm in my 5th day, the pain has subdued and I'm still at the hospital and I must say Italian doctors are very good.
I currently walk with crotches few times a day here in the hospital, one of my concern is my drain hole keeps leaking which bothers me a little therefore my dressing has to be changed everyday.
I have a lot of concern like will my legs become equal again ?
When will the drainage stop ?
Will I be able to lift my leg by myself
This is the most emotional experience in my life. Having a catheter in my penis to having nurses washing you off and not been able to do things on your own.
Thank you reading, most of my friends don't understand what I'm going through because obviously they're young and don't understand the severity of having a THR.

"Hi all
I have a provisional date for September 8th and I've just completed my chair/ sofa measurements for the hospital and realise that my setees in the lounge (3 and 2 seaters) are both too low. There isn't a single chair in the lounge but I do have one in the children's playroom but this has a very low back so not comfortable for long sitting or dozing in.
What advice can you give for the appropriate type of chair that I'll need post op. Is it worth me looking in charity shops for example to buy a high backed type? How long will I be needing it?

"hi to All,
I am new to the Forum and welcome your comments.
I am 68 y.o. and expecting to have a THR next March/April. I am not in pain, just discomfort. I am aware of the hip and it seems to catch at different times, walking is o/k, but not fast.
I am undecided in regard to the operation because I am unaware of what level of mobility may be regained or restricted after the op.I intend to raise this with the surgeon later in the year.
At this time I can ride my motorcycle for about two hours before I need to have a stretch and straighten the leg, full recovery soon follows. I have decided to return to surfboard riding and continuing a flexibility program for this old body. 
Being made aware of the movement that I have now, my concern is how much will this improve or be restricted.Everywhere I read there is great emphasis in relation to the position of the hip in relation to the knee and twisting the leg inwards and outward.
Because of these activities I am really concerned about the hip popping out.
Is there a time when after a THR, the hip can be regarded as safe and secure and the activities can be continued without the thought of post op problems.
Or do I bite the bullet and delay the operation until I am in pain, and still face the same activity problems.
Thank you for reading and sorry to be long winded.
Regards
John

"Hello all of you in the UK - I'm writing from the U.S - Toledo, Ohio to be specific. I am 13 days post-op from my right hip THR. The incision has healed well, and most swelling is gone from leg and ankle. I used a walker for the first week, and am now walking with a cane. Very little pain at this point except for stiffness in the joint - in fact, no significant pain throughout the recovery. My big concern is  that when I walk, it feels as if there is a hitch, hiccup, catch (not sure how to describe it) as the ball moves within the socket. The prosthesis is metal alloy stem and ball moving in a polyethylene socket (probably made one state over in Indiana since Warsaw, Indiana, is a center for companies like Zimmer that make these). It doesn't happen every time I stride, more intermittently, but definitely noticeable, and frankly a little distressing. Almost like the sensation of bone on bone before the sugery, but no pain when it happens - just very irritating. I'm wondering if anyone here on this forum who has had a THR is having or had the same experience? Was supposed to have had my fist post-op followup today with the surgeon, but it had to be rescheduled, so have not had a chance to discuss this yet. He has an excellent reputation as an orthopedic sugeon, and others who I have spoken to who had their hips done by him have not had this issue as far as I know. Thank you all!

"Hey everyone
Well it's been two days for me and it's been an interesting experience. I figured I'd write about it and put some people's minds at ease if they are having a hip replacement done.
I had to come in a day before my surgery to get settled in and I'm glad I did, otherwise I'd have been a wreck emotionally, but it went pretty well. I only really started to panic when I saw some light blood splatter on the operating theaters ceiling. They tried to give me a regional anasthesia, but that didn't work for some reason, so they gave me the usual general. I was out like a light, but I do remember them smacking me awake. Or at least that's how it felt.
I spent an hour in the recovery room before they moved me and needless to say I was extremely careful not to move my leg. Another hour later I was cracking jokes with the nurse in the ICU. Pain was surprisingly non-existant and yeah I know its the pain meds, but I really was very comfortable.
Until I had to go to the bathroom. Going number one was easy and I figured that the physio therapist would show up in no time to get me up and to the bathroom to go number two. Nope. It was a friday and apparently he doesnt work on the weekend. So I felt a tinge of panic.
The whole weekend I was more worried about my intestines than my leg. I even asked the nurses for help but all they could offer was the bedpan and I felt a little weak to use it. Finally it was my roommate who had just gotten his second hip done and knew all about getting up. He got me a walker, got me on my feet and to the bathroom. I am so grateful to that man, now I can finally focus on recovery.
Sorry if it came off as a rant, I just wanted to get some thoughts off my mind.

"I am 50 years old and am in good shape sine I am A personal fitness trainer. I had total hip replacement on June 14 of this year, 11 days ago. Rehab is going great, although still on alot of pain meds for the unreal pain and stiffness. I am driving now and I am fine, with the exception of getting in and out of the car. My question here is, I am going back to work this Thursday which would be 15 days out from my surgery. Doctor has cleared me if I feel like working, but most of my clients are in the medical field that I train and think I am coming back to work to early. Confused just thought I would see other people thought.

"Hi, like many of you, I have bone on bone, osteoarthritis in my right hip. I'm due to have hip replacement in the fall (I was scheduled to have it May 15th, but a root canal got in the way of it!) Being told how important it was to exercise and strenghten the muscles before surgery, I have been walking on a treadmill, about 2 miles a day. My hip seems more painful than ever however, and maybe this is a dumb question, but how does walking or any other type of exercise help when there is constant bone on bone movement? Doesn't it just aggravate the bone on bone?
Thank you, Betty

"I have made it past my first six weeks my surgeon has released me.  I asked him if he could give me an RX for more physical therapy( hey might as well use all of my 24 visits that my insurance covers-my deductible is paid). He was a little reluctant and sent me with a list of exercises and pre-cautions against extreme range of motion.  No yoga or Pilates.  He warned me that some PT's push you too hard and too fast.
So I call the PT place and ask to be put with someone who specializes in hips. I got to appt, meet the guy and just double check that he is experienced with hips, using the anterior surgical method. He assures me he knows all about it and the proceeds to tell me that that hip surgery is ""archaic"". Umm, at this point I can't figure out what to say, I was taken aback.  I finally replied that I was so grateful to have the surgery, in the past the surgery was so much more invasive and I was so glad to be out of pain. Next thing I am showing him the papers my surgeon sent with exercises and the pre-cautions against  extreme range of motion.  The guy barely looks at it, and proceeds to tell me that he is ""A DOCTOR TOO"". And then goes into little lecture about he knows best, blah blah blah, do I want to work hard or just limp my whole life, blah blah blah, I have a bad attitude, ok well I tried to be nice and asked him where he went to school to get his doctorate.  St. Augustines he says- umm I couldn't figure out what he meant so I asked "" oh you mean in Florida"". No in San Diego (CA). Ok put that in the back of my mind, and try to shut up so Mr Know it all can actually help me.  At one point I tried to make a joke ""just remember I am 60 years "".  Got the lecture again about do I want him to treat me like an old lady or an althlete.  If not I won't  get anything out of PT unless he pushes me, and yes there will be pain.  Gag, pretty sure I wanted to slink out of there but stuck with it and in the end he was pretty good.  No serious pain and I got a nice muscle massage at the end.
Fast Forward to when I got home and looked up ""St. Augustine University"". It is a for-profit on-line university. Really and he wants to equate his knowledge and expertise with my super acclaimed orthopedic surgeon.

"Hi to All,
Recently I posted a comment about information overload in reference to prolonged discomfort and dislocations after surgery. Appreciating that this seems to be a sad fact of life, my question is what is the best preparation that one can provide for themself prior to the operation, in regard to muscle tone, strength and flexibility.
I am going through an exercise routine for different reasons but butt and hip muscle strength is a priority. 
I expect to have the op in 8 to 9 months time, so trying to give myself the best chance of a quick recovery.
Your thoughts and recommendations would be very welcomed.
Best Regards
John

"My mother had a paryial hip replacement 4 weeks ago after a fall and fracture. She is 93 years old and beside mild heart and kidneys conditions related to her age she was in general good health and was mobile although with arthritic pain. The post operation has been difficult but she seems to be slowly recovering although her wound opened a bit and it's taking time to heal. She also feels pain in the hip when she walks and sitting in the loo.
I wonder if there others with similar experiences with elderly patients and experiencing pain when walking.

"Hi, since last Fall I have been having sharp pain in my knee area. I've had xrays & MRIs of my knee, my back & my hip. My knee checked out fine. I do have some OA in my back, & moderate to severe OA in my hip. 2 surgeons later & a psysiatrist ( along with 2 steroid shots in my hip ( the last one worsened my knee pain) confirmed to them that I needed a THR.. which is now scheduled for mid Sept. My big fear is that although I probably need a new left hip.. is that the pain is actually being referred from my back somehow. I asked the Drs. & my surgeon said most people have hip & groin pain, but that I was one of the few where the was hip problem referred the pain to about 6 "" above my knee, in my knee & sometimes below my knee. I guess I'm just looking to find another person that has the same symptoms as I have and had a hip replacement & voila the knee pain is gone. I would appreciate any input.

THR last June, and many many thanks for all the support I had here at that time, when I was worried and frightened.  Also for all the good information to help plan and recover. I have not been here for a while. I have been busy, back to work after 12 weeks and I have just moved house!  
One of my big questions was could I Ski again, my surgeon said yes, the Physio said no. And lots of conflicting advice!
i needed to decide for myself and feeling so good booked a 3 hour family Ski session at a Snow Dome.  
After a nervous start I was whizzing down at my old pace, luckily it was very quiet. I was so happy. 
I know now it is a risk but our family Ski holidays have been precious times..... so now will hopefully be going at Xmas. 
I felt so confident I even bought myself a new helmet in the sale. 
I plan on taking extra care and stick to safer and quieter areas. My other hip has degenerative changes and is a bit sore tonight. However I feel I should just go ahead and do the things I love and when it finally crumbles, I will not hesitate to have it replaced. 
Hopefully new and potential Hippies will see this as a positive story. I am so grateful to have had this surgery and the short term anxiety and post Op difficulties are far outweighed by the huge benefits.  I have my life back. 
All the the very best to all of you... Kris. X

After 12 weeks I find myself still needing to use my sticks for any walk outdoors (longer than a few hundred yards) A groin pain appeared after about 7 weeks (just after a stream of steady improvement) and this pain persists in a niggly fashion, along with outer thigh pain (ITB injury from previously I think)   It does mean that without sticks I need to limp and, with the sticks,  I walk straight. Obviously taking pressure off an area works. Otherwise, I have enjoyed steady and gradual improvement in flexibility, comfort and fitness. I wonder if anyone else has had anything similar.? I would love to be outside without my sticks

"Hi, I keep reading on here about the ""bone on bone"" pain that an awful lot of you had prior to surgery. It must have been totally agonising and it's  got me wondering if my pain really is from my hip because the hip xray i had last February showed only ""marked joint space narrowing and small osteophyte compatible with moderate degenerative changes"".
Click here to view image
. But when I returned to see the surgeon following the cortisone injection I asked him what the theatre pictures had shown of my hip degeneration and  I would have put my life on them showing a vastly degenerative hip because the actual injection into the joint reproduced the exact same intense pain I was living with 24/7. He just shrugged and told me the pictures taken  didn't look all that different to my hip Xray last February. I was gobsmacked.
I'm on the list for a THR in October/November but I'm seroisly wondering if all my pain is coming from somewhere else being as my Xrays results are so mild compared with all of you on here. I feel a right fraud. Even my surgeon THINKS it's my hip that's the problem as ""the injection worked well""....Has anyone on here had really awful pain prior to THR but only minimal damage shown on an Xray? I'd be so grateful to hear from anyone with Xrays like mine. How on earth can a hip Xray showing minimal wear and tear create such unbearable pain? What if it's not my hip that's the cause of it all? My recent lumbar spine MRI was fine.

"I posted on the forum a while ago after getting my initial diagnosis and advice for surgery in February here I am again several months later.
Just to recap....diagnosis last year of OA due to hip dysplasia since birth (which I didn't know about) and advice this Feb that I needed a hip replacement. So after re visiting my surgeon in May I have finally come to accept the inevitable and am currently on the waiting list. Op due early September.
I'm 42 years old (mum of 4) and in my own mind, way too young for this surgery but I know things are only going to get worse. Despite having made the decision I'm still finding it hard to rationalise. I can still walk, I walk my dog every day (5 km) although it's hard work and I have a dreadful limp now. I used to run but can't manage that at all now and having been on my feet all day at work I'm struggling with knee pain and back pain and a aching hip. I can't actually believe how things have deteriorated in the last 12 months and yet I still don't quite feel 'bad enough' to warrant surgery.
The whole recovery process fills me with dread. I'm a very active, physical person that doesn't like to sit for too long so I'm worried I won't deal with that very well. However, I'm trying to prepare myself, keeping fit by swimming 50 lengths twice a week and even practising the dreaded sleeping on my back (which I hate).
Any other advice from fellow hippies??

I have a stocking up to my knee and it's stopped the swelling at that point, so all the swelling and bruising is waist to knee. Also I've been sleeping with my feet propped up on pillows and on my back. So it's all probably pooled in the hamstring area.

"Well, I spoke with the surgeon today. He does not have the bedside manner of the surgeon that I have been seeing for a long time. But that surgeon does not perform the anterior THR so I am now with the new one. He actually does both procedures and it is the patient's choice which procedure to have! He believes that in the long run both have the same rate of success. But he does think that the anterior method results in a quicker recovery. So, I am probably having my left hip replacement done next month. He said that I will stay in hospital overnight. The incision closing is also of my choosing - staples, surgical glue, etc. They use a spinal block. And I am scared to death! Now I wait for the call telling me which dates are open for the procedure.

"Hi all,
After years of pain and one crap consultant I finally saw a great Dr on Monday who immediately said I need a replacement as my oesteoarthritis is severe. I knew I was in pain obvs but still came as a shock and I'm still getting my head around the fact I need a new hip and I'm not even 40! However I have reached a point where I am so limited with my mobility ans in pain that I just want to get it done!
my main worry is the recovery, as a busy mum who also works (kids are 10 and 7) I just need to be up and about!

"I had left hip replaced May 30 I posted here about the stem moving but that apparently has now settled in according to X-ray taken on Friday 
today I reached down to pull a briefcase out of my closet. I don't think I broke the 90 degree rule about bending and I can stand on the leg and walk on it. However I feel a soreness now at back of thigh and just to the side of the incision that wasn't there before. I'm a real worriewart so wondered if I did any damage. I read somewhere that some people had walked on a dislocated hip unaware that it was dislocated.
any thoughts on this are appreciated

"In a nutshell the terrible inner thigh & groin pain I've been getting since last February has resulted in a decision being made that it's from my hip after my spinal MRI came back ok. So I'm now on the THR list.
However these are my concerns:
Click here to view image
2. I have absolutely no thigh muscle strength. I'm 75, slim, eat healthily but a physical  mess when it comes to thigh muscle that disappeared years ago. This worries me a lot as people are always saying if you don't build up your muscle strength before your THR, your recovery will take forever after it.  I can't get up off the floor, I can't get in or out of a car, and my inner thigh/groin pain is spreading to my knee. So the whole leg pains a lot. Would any of you suggest a chiropractor - if that's the right word? How does one build up thigh strength if doing exercises makes the pain far worse?
Sorry for the 2 long-winded posts but when I say I'm in a lot of pain all the time I really am..

"Hi loving this site finding it really helpful. I've posted a few days ago about not been able to sleep at night. I find it difficult to sleep on my back and cannot keep my legs flat so I tend to sleep with either my operatedcleg s knee raised or both knees raised.
Not sure why this is happening but I read until really tired and then try to sleep. As soon as I lay in my sleeping position my legs start moving about almost uncontrollably. They can't find a comfy position I have to readjust pillows etc and it can be hours by the time they stop.
Being sleep deprived is exhausting I'm now on day 10. I've tried sleeping tablets but I still go through the same procedure with my legs .
Has anyone else come across this or have any advise. I see my physio this Thursday
Thanks a very tired Sue

"I had my left hip replacement on May 30 had X-ray and staples removed June 16 X-ray showed the stem had moved a bit. I worried about this of course thinking I would have to have revision. I've still been doing physio once a week and exercises daily at home. The incision healed very nicely and I only have a bit of stiffness in the operated leg, however my so called""good leg"" has lots of aches and stiffness due to the exercises and arthritis. We've been having a lot of rain and that's not good for arthritis.
today I had another X-ray and saw the surgeon. He was pleased that I was walking well with a walker and the stem showed no more movement. It has settled in place, thank goodness. I can use a cane now but still have the 90 degree rules (due to posterior approach operation) I'll be seeing surgeon and having another X-ray on July 21. I was on Meloxicam before surgery but had to go off it seven days prior to surgery and because it was an anti-inflammatory the pain I had at that time went up over100% the surgeon told me today I can go back on Meloxicam so that hopefully will ease some of the arthritis aches. All and all, the hip surgery has been a success so far and after I'm fully recovered and find that I will need the other hip done, I will not hesitate.  I believe I left it too long to have the present surgery because it's possible my recovery might take longer than some others. The surgeon told me the arthritis was terrible and the cartilage eaten away and covered in cysts. No wonder I had so much pain!
ill continue with physio and I'm cutting out pain meds (Tylenol 3) except I think I'll take one before physio because some of the exercises can cause some pain. 
Thanks everyone who has commented on my posts previously I really appreciate all the input.
good luck to all in your recoveries 
all the best, Ginny

"Hi All,
I have had a rather bad time this year. Jan 29th I walked the dog 5 miles, cycled 50 or so miles with our club, and went to bed.
The next morning, I couldn't walk and the pain was terrible.
A&E, GP,  etc etc excuse excuse for two months and a ton of painkillers. The GP said ""I guess we'll have to fix the addiction after we cure the (unknown) problem. 
Finally, after waiting ages to see a physio, the one I saw looked at me in horror and told me to go home, call an ambulance and refuse to budge until seeing an orthopaedic Dr.
Two week wait for exploratory surgery and hip biopsy and then 6 weeks on IV antibiotics. I had had a rare bacteria that had caused septic arthritis and destroyed my hip in about one month. the ball was gone and the socket pitted. More like a stick in a bucket than ball and socket.
Anyway, end of a long story is that I had a hip replacement a week back. I am feeling great and all the pain is gone. Just a little local bruising. As for the copious amounts of adictive medicines.....they're all stopped without problem.
Very aware of the ""dont do's"" but am getting on with the exercises. The day after the op the physio had me walk the corridors and climb stairs. He signed me off for release and I just had to wait for microbiology to confirm there was no remaining infection.
Best Wishes to all and I hope you're enjoying your new hips as much as I am.

Considering amount of declofenac and paracetamol before hand it is amazing to be pain free. The only problems I have is back sleeping, and swelling in ankle and above knees. I know I am not alone. I developed very painful heels from pressure from back sleeping so purchased a pillow leg raiser thing. It is amazingly comfortable, takes pressure of heels and makes lying on back more bearable. However yesterday I started to feel more swelling than I have had and today it is quite firm, above the knee and makes bending knee uncomfortable cos so tight. Tho ankle has improved. There is no redness and no pain, I am icing the swelling itself and hasnt helped. Do you think it sounds nirmal swelling been told to expect given no pain.? Havent had thd TED stockings off other than shower as instructed. I am not on blood thinning injections as freaked me out, so on daily aspirin instead. also it started when used the leg elevator, tho improved the ankle so going to not use it see if improves, but really helps heel pain.Anyone else had the same or should I make appointment.

I had my right hip replaced over 5 years ago and I still have some pain.  It is not as bad as it was before the surgery but bad enough that I have to take medication for it.  (I was taking 2400 mg of ibuprofen each day before the surgery.  Now, I am taking 1800 mg each day.  But, that doesn't always work.)  My doctor says, ""That happens sometimes.""   I am finding that difficult to accept.  I am trying to get a second opinion.  Anyone got any other ideas?  Comments?  What about other medications?  I am concerned about the long-term side effects of ibuprofen.  Any other non-narcotic medications with which anyone has had success?

Three days ago after an almost perfect recovery, a had a horrid experience whilst sleeping.
I think I had rolled over on the ok hip. I rolled back and moved the right foot inwards and I felt the whole hip joint ker chunk back into the joint. It was momentarily painful. I have since walked and sat etc with no pain. However the hip is clicking constantly.

"I知 feeling a bit sorry for myself and could do with some fairy hugs!
To recap - I had a surprise diagnosis of severe osteoarthritis last year, leading to a THR on my right hip in June 2016.  Though my surgeon indicated at the time that my left hip would also need replacing fairly soon, I had hoped that it would be at some point in the future, preferably in the far distant future.
During my 6 month follow up in December, my surgeon suggested that the second op should be scheduled for early 2017, but I felt that I couldn稚 cope with another operation so soon after the first one and decided to delay making the decision for a further 6 months, which took me to last Wednesday and another meeting with my surgeon.
I have reluctantly accepted that I have got to have my left hip done this year and have been given a waiting time of 2 to 3 months (pretty good for the NHS).
There is also the other issue  now I know (sort of) what to expect.  I am absolutely dreading the first 2 weeks at home  it was a nightmare last time! Sometimes ignorance really is bliss!
Now, I know I知 being daft, but I just wish that there was another option.

"Hi everyone, I am having a LTHR on the 27th June, I have never had an operation and I'm very anxious, does anyone have any advice on coping with the before and after of the op? 
I was born with hip dysplasia and didn't know I had it, I have always been very active did gymnastic and athletics growing up, I've had four children luckily they are now aged from 13 to 22 years ( I am 42), up until two years ago I was a keen jogger and had active work, then bam I started getting groin pain and over the last two years it's stopped me in my tracks, I've 3 steroid injections and 6 months of physio but this hasn't worked, the docs were going to do an osteotomy but because of angles of my dysplasia there was a risk of impingement and I didn't want to put myself through that for it not to work, so I'm left with THR, and I will be put back on the list for my other hip after this one is done because unfortunately its bilateral, and my right hip became symptomtic 5 months after the left, I am completely gutted, especailly as my cartilage is actually pretty good at the moment, but the pain is dreadful I can't sit comfortably or walk too far, so I know I have no choice.
The doctors told my mum I had hip dysplasia when I was born but it was mild and wouldn't cause me problems so they didn't treat it, she didn't tell me until I started getting pain at age 39, but then she had no idea it would affect me after being told that, i'm glad she did or diagnosis would have been a lot longer!

"Hi, Many thanks for all your good wishes, hugs etc. It really means so much to me. I've been home for a couple of weeks now. I had a total hip revision No. 5 on 6th May, together with a Tummy tuck and the fat removed placed into my leg to fill the void from a simply massive psuedotumour.  Trouble was I really didnt need a tummy tuck so its been every scrap of fat has been scraped off and I've been stitched back together so tightly its difficult to stand up straight or reach up.
All was well even though I have lost all abductor muscles now, [the tochanter broke with the last dislocation] and have few functioning other muscles, due to 3 sugeons doing the wrong thing and metal on metal corrosion. The 'plumbing in' of my tummy fat, I was told to imagine a loaf of bread...... was not only to fill the void but to introduce a healthy blood supply to the area, and try and stop the endless cycle of tumours forming. 
Fast forward 3 weeeks and seeing the Plastics consultant she thought there was a lot of fluid around the leg, and proceeded to aspirate it.  2 days later I became ill with fever and infection! Back in hospital for 2 washouts and home on oral anti biotics and IV ones. Unfortunately the oral ones Rifadin made me so unwell, lost 4.5lbs in 3 days. I had to reduce them but am trying to slowly build them up again. I've had a real battle with this infection and have felt simply awful.but fortunately as of this week my inflamatory markers have come down. I'm trying to keep well for another 6 weeks or so to give time for my 'loaf of bead to mature and develop itsown blood supply through the whole thing......clever stuff! However I have only less than 5% chance of not having to have the metal work taken out for a number of months before I can start all over again!
Its really tough, It really frightens me as I cannot have a spacer because of muscle loss. Having experienced the pain of dislocation 4 times,  cannot see how the pain could be any different from this..... does anyone else have experience of this? Your thoughts and advice would be really helpfull.
Love to all you Hippies

"Hello, I haven't written in some time.  I has a THR (Ontario, Canada) in sept 2015.  Fairly young at 53 for AVN.  Like many I felt at the start it wasn't right.  After 3 months I still could barely get out of bed, and the pain felt like a 9 inch blade in my hip.  I was so long using  walker that I needed carpal tunnel surgery in 2016.  I saw my ortho guy repeatedly and he kept saying he didn't know what was wrong.  He sent me to the pain clinic in 2016, I saw them once and they didn't return my phone calls.  I called the ortho guy and told him I wanted a second opinion, and that if he couldn't refer me I would have my Family MD do it.  Well it took until Sept 2016 (1 year later to see the second guy), the ortho MD put in the request.  It was to the head of the ortho department.  He did an MRI and blood tests.  He found nothing on the MRI and nothing in the blood work and told me that I would just have to ""live with it"".  At this point I had wheelchair parking, I could barely lift my leg into the car, driving was tough, after work I came home and stayed in bed until the next day.  I couldn""t walk ny distance. I have a good boss and he cancelled all my meetings until this got resolved, to reduce my walking.  So realizing that I would have to live with it, i made an appointment with a chiropractor to see if he could offer accupuncture, or something else.  He asked if the hospital could sent him the MRI report before he would do anything.  The MRI report showed a tear in the tendon and a compartment of fluid the size of a pop can.  The chiropractor said he wasn't touching me until these issues were resolved.  I went back to first ortho guy and didn't get to talk to him, only his resident.  He said that tears always happen in the shoulder and they never fix them.  My husband told him that I don't walk on my shoulder.  Another resident said that the MRI sometimes have ""abberations"" and it wasn't a problem.  I made an appointmnet to see Ortho MD and not one of his residents.  I did my research on PubMed (a website where you can look up clinical research).  I gave him 2 or 3 articles where patients had the same thing as me:  pain and a tear on MRI and after it was repaired the patients were pain free.  Then I told him he was doing the surgery.  He agreeded (gasp).  I had the surgery 2 days ago.  Well I didn't have a tear in the tendon, I had a detached tendon, several rips in various muscles and an IT band that had separated.  He fixed all this all up. And drained all the fluid.   Even 2 days later I feel so much better.  I'm at home now and feel that after 4 years from when the hip pain first began, much more hopeful.

2016- a year or so I have increasing pain, motion loss, etc. ... you know.
Hire new Dr.- stem loosening again from cement that should have been removed.
2017- Revision #2- Osteotomy used- cement removed, 185mm modular stem implanted and Cerclage wires securing femur. 3 months complete bed rest, p/t begins and feeling pretty good. Last month pain increases, Dr says the Cerclage Wire has started to erode, but the femur bone union looks good. Dr. stops all P/T and I must use cane at all times for next year at minimum so to walk without limping. If I limp I am to stop and rest. Also no lifting more that 10 lbs and the return of basic hip precautions. Re-valuate every 3 months as it is now a race between the femur bonding or the wire breaking. In any case the wire will have to be removed at some point.
Hoping someone might have info on Cerclage Wire removal surgery (searched the net and not much -Dr. says we'll cross that bridge ...)
I'm in NYC and first doctor is Chief of OS at top 5 hospital, current doctor at #1 hospital in US/NYC. Starting to think it's me. ?
Thanks again.

"Had THR on my right side 5 weeks ago, seems like things are going well. My surgeon has me on 6 weeks non baring weight on my new hip. It's hard since I'm a very active person, but doing my best. Good part is I have no more pain and feel like I could go for a run. Thing is last night when I was showering I notice that my right side has a bump right where my new hip is. Looked in the mirror and my right side sticks out more then left, doesn't really hurt but kind of weird that something is wrong. Is this normal??? Has anyone else have this happen to them or is it because of the non use of my right leg for these 5 weeks

"Just hoping some of you experienced hippies can reasure me. Had right anterior THR 7 days ago and had felt I had made slow but steady progress - exercises getting a bit easier and pain reducing. Then at 4pm today it became really hard to put any weight on my leg and pain increased alot when weight bearing. Have iced and took extra pain relief etc. Just a bit spooked out that I have stuffed it up some how. I have no restrictions on what I can do as its anterior. Any clues at all. Hoping to wake up feeling a bit better tomorrow. Thanks

"I'm hoping that many of you will be well informed about progress being made for people like us who've had hip surgeries and are dreading the revision surgery.  I'm youngish (55) but not in the best of health (MS) so doubt I'll be able to go through a revision surgery which I hope won't be for many years.  It's scary to think that if you're not mobile/fit enough to have the surgery, then you're left in pain.  Is there any hope for a less invasive surgery in future?

"Hi...
In December 2013, (I was 43) I had my left hip replaced. Recovery went good, did the follow up PT and was on my merry way. However, I did notice that 4-5 months after surgery my thigh hurt. I was told it was bursitis. I was kinda baffled as I thought bursitis was in a joint. Anyhow, I was given an RX for a pain patch. Well, the pain patch worked on other parts of my body but not the thigh. The pain kinda disappeared. But would return every now and then. I was given the ok to start working out to rebuild muscle. I'm also an avid equestrian and being in shape is important for my career. In the last past 5 months, I've noticed my pain becoming more and more consistent. I had stopped working out about a year ago (now a complete blob) But during my workouts, I have not pressed weights just did elliptical for tone AND didn't feel pain. Also, I have not fallen off (always a plus) so I'm not sure where this  pain is coming from. I seriouly feel like my leg is broken. But it will go back to a normal feeling. Though, these last four days have been the worse. The pain was almost unbearable. I nearly fell on my face today as it caught me off gaurd. Has anyone experienced a loose stem? And if so, from what am I discribing, does this sound familar?? I have an appointment Monday and I really don't want to hear it's bursitis.

"    I was hit head on by a drunk driver in 1988 and had to have a total hip replacement and steel plate put in my pelvis. I had that replacement for 26 years and it wore through the plastic insert and the bone got diseased around the pelvis and one day the whole joint and pelvis broke and went up inside my pelvic cavity. I walked on crutches for several months while a search was on for an orthopedic surgeon that could patch me back together because the original surgeon who did me was retired.
?      So at 53 years old I had my second replacement with a tri-flange joint that wires to the outside edge of the pelvis. I told the surgeon my only request is that you get my bad leg the same length as my good leg because I live to be barefoot all the time. Well after he stretched my leg back out 1 1/2 inches I now have a paralyzed foot and ankle. It's been over a year since surgery. Had a month and a half of physical therapy in the beginning. I have to take massive doses of neurotin and had to be fitted for a AFO brace to be able to walk. I walked for so many years with old replacement with a crooked pelvis, I am now level and it is pinching nerves on my right side. I have 4 lumbar prolapsed discs and right leg (good leg) is going numb. So now they are scheduling me for a BurstDR stimulator to shock the nerves on my spine to deaden the pain. I was active, but now I'm not and really at a loss as to what to do. Trying to wean myself down for 3 doses a day of 1200mg neurotin. I can push down with my foot but can't lift it and have no muscle movement on outside of leg from knee down,  so without a cane I can easily get overcentered and fall to the left. I have trouble sleeping. Can't lay on my back or sides and could never sleep on my stomach, but Dr prescribed sleeping pills leave me groggy. It's been 14 months and I'm getting depressed and don't know what to do to help my situation. I feel I need more physical therapy with foot and ankle but insurance won't pay for that anymore and with only wife working now and medical bills rolling in. I can't afford 3rd party physical therapy. Gonna try to get back to bicycle riding to try and strengthen that ankle. Feet and toes swell and the color of foot is different from my good one and toes are starting to look a little deformed from always pushing down. Oh the foot cramps in the arch of the foot. The leg right above the ankle looks like skin over bone with not much muscle. Can't walk without the brace, but the brace causes alot of swelling. So what can I do? I can't give up, but it sure is tough!

"hi folks
i had my left hip replacement surgery May 30 went to first outside physio  appointment on June 14 for assessment. I had been placing a pillow longwise under my operated leg for sleeping on my back as it more comfortable but physiotherapist told me I shouldn't have done that because my knee wouldn't go flat down when she tested it. She gave me more exercises to do at home and I will be going to physio once a week for approximately 6 weeks. I hate sleeping on my back but will persevere and will do the exercises that were given to me. I'm also walking a bit more each day. Today I went to hospital to have the staples removed and had an X-ray of the hip. My surgeon then reviewed everything said I was walking just fine and the incision looked good. However, the X-ray showed the stem has moved a bit. Surgeon said it is settling in, and everyone heals differently. The only pains I'm having are really aches from my thigh to my knee, especially the knee. He told me that is just normal healing.
i have to go back for another X-ray in two weeks but I am really worried. Is this dislocating? I'm now afraid to do the exercises in case I move something more.
this was done with the posterior approach and is not cemented.
has anyone had this happen to them?

"Hi. I had an anterior THR on my righy in November 2016. I was diagnosed about 6 yrs ago and kept putting it off. I also need my left done this year. I had no problems after surgery. Did some PT and started having some groin pain and thigh stiffness. I'm 6 months post and this thigh stiffness started about 3 months ago. After sitting or laying I get up and my thighs now moth feel very tight. I'm wondering where did this come from. I'm very discouraged. Doc says I need more walking. After being up for a while it helps a lot but once I sit or lay down it's back to the same stiffness. I know I'm used to walking like I used to before surgery as I was in so much pain. Maybe that's part of it. But it is hard also because my leg is longer than the other and I have a pelvic tilt which I've had for many years. Has anyone experienced this thigh stiffness?

"Starting a new discussion but i don't want to frighten anyone going for surgery! I'm sorry it's so long; hope there's no word limit!
I was the TRHR "".00001%' chance of problem during/post surgery. August 2016 surgery (front) expecting night or two only in hospital, and to walk after surgery:
Surgery 1- TRHR surgery, up the next morning to go to bathroom and felt a popping in thigh getting up from toilet. X-ray immediately taken. Negative.
RESULTS: couldn't walk without pain more than several steps. Medicated. Stayed four nights and released, still problem walking with walker. NO RESTRICTIONS. walk and exercises. If I was having so many problems, WHY didn't they do. CT SCAN before they released me??
RECOVERY: at home for a few days, still problems, progressirng slowly but improving. Stepped down to reach for something. Again felt pop. After just 5 days at home called dr. Something not right. X-ray in office- chip/fracture at rod entry. Scheduled for repair and revision next morning. ASKED WHY??? Was told I had the bones of a 70 year old. I'm only young 66.
SURGERY #2- CT scan to be sure all was ok. Was told I now had hairline fracture down femur. Need to do another surgery., cables, screws to repair femur hairline fracture. could go home, toe-touch only for 4-6 weeks. Went to rehab facility instead just to be safe.
REHAB RECOVERY: 1 small incision and one long( 88 staples) incision from going into longer area twice. Incision oozing so much. Was getting around rehab in wheelchair. Finally subsided enough to care for it at home break out of the joint once I proved I could function ok for self care- in and out of car, shower, steps, etc.
FOLLOW-UPS:I was progressing. Finally walking without assistance. Incision site from second surgery at very top wasn't healing. PA cauterized it several times. Started to heal then still opening. Last visit, finally grabbed the ""DR to look at it. IMMEDIATELY called their very busy WOUND CARE to get me in right away. Went to wound care once s week for 4-5 weeks. Had to stay off leg as much as possible. Finally healed.
8 MONTHS post-op
Normal life, walking. Still uncomfortable at times. Pain in thigh now and then . Dr said it's tissues, etc. Takes a year at least. Started to feel uncomfortable again. Couldn't walk for several days. Rod is down to right above my knee. Suddenly having severe pain knee pain. Suddenly unable to walk. The extreme limp to get me back to the car and into house now has affected not only left knee, but right side (hip? Bursitis?) Depression.

The other test was CRP and it was a little highhigh at 0.7 mg/dl and shoud be less than .5 
Waiting for meeting with Doctor to discuss test  results 
Vascular surgeon and the Ortho Surgeon have all reviewed the new x-rays and agree that the hip and femur have healed  so there must be another reason for the pain.  Could be Lupus since I don't have Heart problems.  Has anyone else experienced something like this?

"Hi to all again,
Today marks 4 weeks since my Right hip replacement.  I think I'm doing okay, though impatient to be back to normal!  Had the staples removed(OUCH) 2 weeks ago, the incision is looking and feeling better, though still some numbness and topical soreness near it.  My concern is that, according to an in-home PT, my right leg is about 1/2"" longer than the left, causing a slight limp.  I e-mailed the surgeon right away, saying this was a ""big concern""!  His medical assistant said he reviewed the x-rays taken during surgery and didn't see a difference.  He suggested putting heel cusions in my left shoes and will take a close look at my x-rays and talk with me at the 6 week check-up.  Is this something that is expected?  Will continued therapy (now outpatient) correct this as the healing continues?  Anyone else experience this situation?  Did it improve?  Thank you!  Jean

"Tomorrow is my one year, one month anniversary posterior RTHR.  
I still  have tightness and slight pain from where the wound was in the back,  kind of going across the groin or very upper thigh when I walk, slight pain and definite stiffness and tightness going up stairs in wound area and groin,  a lot of unrelenting discomfort, not exactly pain in my groin to my knee throughout entire thigh.  I guess you can say,  when I lie down and bend my leg towards ceiling, my thigh is still stiff, tight and doesn't feel right.
My latest xray showed no fracture and everything in place and up until now, my surgeon poo poo's all of my complaints which really started early on and have not resolved.  
My newest xray found something that says subtle periosteal reaction  in the posterior cortex of the femor.  
Nothing I read about periosteal reaction is good.  But it's subtle.  Whatever that means.  
Tomorrow I will be seeing my surgeon.
 If he poo poo's me again, I think I'll have a breakdown because now my other side is ready to get a  replacement and I don't want to proceed until I know everything is okay with the first surgery.  And I'm still wary after all this time and worried about infection too. Any similarities or comments on any of this would be greatly appreciated.

"I had a THR of my right hip 11 weeks ago and everything is going well although I haven't been offered any physiotherapy. However when I saw my surgeon at six weeks although he seemed very pleased with my progress he told me that I will never be able to bend much beyond 90 degrees and will never be able to reach my feet to be able to put on my socks, tie shoelaces or cut my toenails! Having asked around I find that without exception friends and friends of friends who have had hip replacements are all able to do this even though it may take some time. The physiotherapy department at the hospital said they had never heard of anybody being told this before and the nurse at my GP's surgery (who had a hip replacement six years ago) said that was rubbish! I have tried, without success, to contact my surgeon and all I could get was an appointment with him, but not until the end of June. I feel I am wasting time when I could be getting more mobile. I can't believe that my THR can be different from anybody else's - I don't want to spend the rest of my life having to depend on other people or mobility aids to do simple tasks like washing and dressing. Has anybody else been told this by their surgeon?

"Hi, if anyone had to do the above following a diagnostic hip injection, did you come off pain relief whilst recording your pain levels for those 2 weeks? I'm not sure if I should have taken off my morphine patches because all my pain has now come back but immediately following the injection there was no pain. I'm just asking if any of you took anything because surely that is defeating the object of the exercise? I'm in a right old mess. I should have asked....

"Hi you all. I've read and read past threads and I try to stay positive. And patient. But I feel like I'm right back at the beginning. I had my TKR 5 weeks ago and I know that sounds too soon to complain. When I go to pt and they massage my leg, I feel better, like I am making progress, but when I leave, within 30 minutes, everything is back. Swollen! Stiffness! Limping! Pain! I need as much ice, pain medication, as in the beginning. Can't bend past 90 or straighten to 100. Still sleeping in a chair, for 45 minute increments....all night long. I am doing exercise at home but I worry all the time if my leg will ever be straight again? Will my limping ever go away? I'm not doing enough... I'm sorry I sound like a big baby. But I just had to say it all. I think these things as the minutes just keep ticking by...unchanging.

"Worrying long term now!  I've had a hemiarthroplasty and was worried about osteoarthritis in future so was planning on reducing my exercise so as not to erode cartilage.  Logically the less I use the hip the longer the cartilage will last and I don't think I'd be strong enough to have a revision as I have MS.  Now I'm reading things about the importance of keeping muscles strong as otherwise the joint loosens and this causes problems.  What ""loosens"" and what type of pain does that cause?  I may be wheelchair bound in future so assuming that will delay osteoarthritis but will that problem be replaced by pain from loosening of muscle?  Very confused and people so knowledgeable on this site.  Won't see surgeon for months so thought I'd pick your brains.  Thanks in advance.

"I am almost 4 weeks post-op, surgery for LTHR was May 11th. I have had a mostly easy recovery. The hospital time was very painful and difficult but since day 1 at home has been much better. I have physio at home twice a week and it goes well. My physio says I am doing well, yet I have on and off days. I have to mention I had a total left knee replacement one year ago. I waited until I felt it had reasonably recovered before having the hip done. After the knee I was regretfully still using a cane thinking it was from the hip pain. I had some remaining stiffness in that knee but bought me and my surgeon thought that was from my lack of exercise or a lot of movement because of the super painful hip. Now hip itself, where I was having pain before near the groin and around to outer edge, has almost zero pain. Now while I have gone from walker to cane and have walked short distances without either ut with a limp. My physio says limp is coming from knee. Knee is stiff and I now have some pain down leg, just on the left outside edge of knee area. It has some tingling and extreme sensitivity. I want to get back to walking without aids, before all of this I did not need them. I have good balance. The left knee just has the stiffness and some pain when walking causing me to limp and not walk stably? My physio seemed unconcerned. Is this normal? Is the leg affected down as far as the edge of the knee? I just want to get back to a normal walk, but maybe it's just too soon? I don't see my surgeon for another month. I also have usual very good days but the day after physio, I can barely walk. I suppose that is just an after effect of the physio, she often works me hard which seems fine at the time. That is okay but wondering if it's fairly normal? I sleep fairly well but am more tired than before surgery. I am not a nap person, so I am sleeping late these days. I awake 3 or 4 times during night, usually need to use bathroom and sometimes takes awhile to get back to sleep, but I am fairly comfortable in bed and seem to sleep pretty well. I fel very lucky in most aspects and feel a bit silly with my questions, but I know many have been through this and possibly some have had my issues. I might add, I have also been doing some light exercising in the pool on good days, it's an outside pool. I am often exhausted the next day the same as after physio, no matter how carefully I try to exercise with a lot of relaxation in between. I have a hard time even finding my incision, it has healed well. I am probably being silly but it's easy to have concerns after major surgery.

"hi folks I guess i am now an official hippie. I had my operation on Tues. came home yesterday. The terrible pain is gone but the area feels sore and raw I guess to be expected. I am bruised quite a bit all around the incision. I am icing mostly in daytime, I'm only taking Tylenol 3, I can take two every 4 hours but I'm just taking one. I have three exercises to do....ankle pumps knee press and butt squeeze 10 reps three times a day. I don't seem to have much of an appetite mostly thirsty. I am 78 yrs old live alone and have everything prepared in advance to manage on my own. My granddaughter drove me home yesterday and insisted she stay overnight to be on the safe side I had a little scare yesterday when blood leaked out of the bandage but we put a sterile gauze pad over the end spot where it was coming out. Granddaughter went to pharmacy and purchased more pads. I have dressing changes but only if it gets wet. I have to change them myself . I thought I would have a big problem getting into bed but I managed although my leg felt like it weighed 100 lbs. granddaughter went home but is available if needed. I'm pretty independent so will see how it goes. Staples come out June 16 then I start physiotherapy at a physio clinic once a week. My granddaughter will drive me there, will do groceries or laundry while I am doing that at least that's the plan.
i just thought I would give you an update and also ask if that raw sore feeling is the norm.

"Had my first solo trip to the supermarket. I'm still partial weightbearing so put crutches in the trolley and scoot round the store. No problems there but coming out of the store the pavement (sidewalk) was sloping and I had to use one crutch to stop the trolley falling off the kerb. Arriving at the car I only had one crutch! I scatched my head - what had I done with it! Retraced my steps and someone had parked a bike near the exit and my crutch had caught on it and was dangling. I was quite relieved as I was begiining to wonder about my sanity.

"Hi All, Firstly thank you for everyones good wishes, prayers, hugs and garden flowers.It has meant so much to me I'm awaiting a discharge this afternoon, it will be so lovely to get home. After the 2 wash outs, its been confirmed that its definately infected, almost certainly from the first aspiration! I've been given a Hickman line[ access to artery by my collar bone] to be given IV antibiotics, for possibly 6 weeks, this will be under constsnt review. The plan is for giving the tissue transer from my tummy to my hip a couple of months, to establish a better blood supply. THen I'll have to come back to hospital to have the hip removed.Possibly for 4 months or so and unfortunately as I have lost so much muscle, no spacer can be put in. Ultimately I will have no use in that leg during this process. So long as it shows that all bacerior is gone, then we can get some metal work back.Its such a shame as the hip I've got now is the best I've had since I broke it nearly 7 years ago. The surgeon has told me that I've got less than a 5% chance of not having to have the hip out. Not great odds, still better than none. I,m will still be looking at wheelchairs and stair lifts etc.  Love to everyone Patsy X

"HI everybody:  It's been 6 1/2 months since my anterior, non-cemented THR and I have been in severe pain the entire time.
My surgeon said he was confused and had never seen my symptoms before. The worst of the symptoms were an inability to go from walking to standing, thigh pain near the lower tip of the device, and an upside down U shape of pain around the top of the device.   
I was referred to a another surgeon for a second opinion. The new doctor is very experienced and respected. He said that my femur was broken during the operation, plusI likely have micro-motion due to a loose stem.
He was very positive about my eventual recovery. He said that the cracked femur appears to be healing and he expects that the pain from the micro-motion of the stem will go away as the bone grows around it over the next 6 months. While I was happy to finally have an explanation for the pain and the inability to go from sitting to standing, I'm skeptical that this will heal.  My pain is getting worse, not better.  
My 3 questions are these:
1) Is it realistic to believe that the femur can heal while the device is loose in my leg?
2) Does micro-motion of a loose stem ever go away as the bone heals?  
3) Is it likely that a revision surgery will be needed to fix this? 
Thanks so much for your answers.  I read these discussions and posts nearly every day.

"Morning everyone, I had a call from the hospital inviting me for my 1 year sign-off appointment with my surgeon. We will be away on holiday when my THR anniversary comes around so I went to see him yesterday (a few weeks early).
He's really, really pleased with how I have recovered & happy with my x-rays. As I'd been getting a few twinges in my other hip, he x-rayed that as well & compared it to last year. The good news is it hasn't really changed much - a small amount of cartilage has gone but nothing too drastic so he said he's hoping he doesn't see me again for a good few years!
I'm so pleased & can't thank my wonderful surgeon enough & all of the nursing staff etc. at the hospital & of course all of you horrible lot! My hip forum friends, who will never know how much you all helped when I was first diagnosed (blimey, that feels like years ago)! You all offered help & advice at all times of the day & night, before, during & after my op & for that I can't truly thank you enough. Whether you are just starting out on your journey, midway or nearing the end, be positive & stay strong.

"Hi , The last time I was on here my hip had just dislocated and I was in the terrible situation of not being able to go to my local hospital as 2 of the surgeons working there were the cause of all my problems 6 and a half years ago athough I only found that out following my 3rd revision last year. Cutting a long story short I was under the care of the Royal orthpeadic hospital at Stanmore but had been discharged as they felt they couldn't do anymore for me. The prothesis as subluxating, popping in and out ,and the psuedo tumour was massive . I was referrred to a consultant at St Geoges. I ended up getting a private ambulance to get me there. It was put back in but because of all the continuing problems it was decided to do another revision with a restraing cup, but because the psuedotumour and nectrotic tissue was so vast, the size of a melon, he worked with 2 plasic surgeons who removed all the fat from my stomach, really painful and tight because I din't have that much there, and with an artery and 2 veins plumbed it into my hip. An 8 hour op!. Its been awful and I've really strugged with the recovery. On thursday the plastic surgeon aspirated my hip as there was a lot of fuid and again on Friday. Saturday I became iil with shaking and high temperatue. Was admitted again , yesterday had the wound opened again and washed out. Tomorrow the Ortho sugeon wants to open it again to see if the infection has reached the prothesis. I'm terrified because it would mean it would all have to come out, be without a hip for goodness knows how long. This will be the 13th proceedure on this hip, I'm really not sure I can take much more. Sorry felling pretty sorry for myself at the moment. Has anyone else had issues with infection? I cant believe anything else can go wrrong, 3 surgeons messing up badly, the metal on metal hip reacting and caused maassive tissue and muscle loss, and when it dislocated this time, tha plate that was fixed to the torchanter broke that part of the bone off so the little muscle attachment left there has now gone. I think we need to send a few prayers up for tomorrow, it's about time I had some luck.

"I started posting in late Jan 14 after I was finding that my new hip was not working well...
It took my surgeon 18 months to agree and send me for second opinions - both of whom diagnosed the problem in 5 minutes.
I had a THR on the other hip in the meantime and then in Sept 16 the Dec 13 hip was revised. I am delighted to say now that my hips are fully recovered.
SO - if there are any hippies out there who think that their hip is wrong then perserve. The part I had was too big and basically that was the problem. Smaller part = success, relief of pain, lopsidedness and misery. Do Not be Told that you will have to  put up with it. Get second opinions, document everything and never give up hope. I had some very dark weeks and it was the ongoing support of this forum that really helped me.
I now have some other unrelated health issues but feel much more able to face them after such a good recovery.
Hugs and best wishes to you all

I have had a lot of operations omy back having discs fused due to osteoporosis but wondered if anybody else was like this.  Oh and my hips are still very swollen and I cannot get some of my clothes to fit me.

I used to hike in the mountains, my last hike was 16 miles in 2014. Now it is a victory when I walk up the stairs without using the handrail. Anyone else experiencing a delayed recovery like this? I'm 48 years old.

"Looking for some answers? I am a male 52 in good shape. I had THR due to prednisone consumption about 5 months ago. It was the easiest and quickest fix I could hardly have imagined. Rehab could not keep me as a patient because I was walking anywhere easily in two weeks. Unfortunately, I had to run a short distance at about 6-8 weeks. I felt an immediate tearing feeling and it went on for a few days. I went back to my surgeon and xrays showed a perfect hip, since that time it has really gotten bad. I went back to my surgeon and he seems to think it may be a back issue, I do have a herniated disk, but I know after having this for years it is both. I am almost positive the prosthesis came loose in my femur or I tore the Piriformis muscle badly. I am now about to set another appointment with surgeon who has no bedside personality at all but is an excellent surgeon. My concern is how to get him to understand rehab is not fixing this and I would like as much input on what might be going on from anyone. Here are my symptoms; radiating sciatic pain continually, pain specific down the top of thigh to my knee when walking or carrying anything, a lot of pressure from the entire area of the incision to the cup assembly area, very, very tender along the rear buttock, outside buttock, down the left side of my thigh - so much just a touch is tender. Lying in bed on either side is painful. A few key things is my surgeon gave me a shot in the incision area which did no good as did my back Dr. gave me a block 6th in my disk area with some help for a day but not the hip it did not help it any, even during the medicine given during the procedure. I would really like some feedback before my surgeon calls me back. It feels like that Pirformis muscle is torn badly and not healing at all or the prosthesis is loose and sliding back into place when the xrays are taken with me still. Help!

I am 3 months post op and cant barely walk cuz it makes pain worse..sitting makes it worse also. Consequently but as a minor thing i have pins and needles running down right side of op leg to foot.
doctors PA who handles everything after surgery says they dont know what the problem is. They removed fluid from joint to make sure it was not an infection and thank God it came back negative. Surprisingly pins and needles went away for 4 days after fluid removal then came back.

"The Rules of Sleep Club (again) for the Newbies
Posted 9 months ago
There are many, many posts regarding sleep (of the lack of it) post-op so I thought I would share (again), my favourite post from Kate, a fellow forum member. It is invaluable advice especially for the newbies.
SLEEP CLUB
Hi everyone, I was looking back through some old posts trying to find one about constipation if all subjects (!) & I found Kate's post about sleeping. I'm sure she won't mind as I've took the liberty of copying it again. It was such a great read & made perfect sense particularly now I'm post -op.
As I now consider myself a hip guru after two THR's wink I thought I would impart my most considerable knowledge about sleeping post op.
So as you gather in closer to the screen to read I am going to poke you in the eye and tell you the first first rule...
1) There are no rules of sleep club
In fact there are so many rules of sleep club world wide that it would be hard to confine them all but we are all victim to our country, our county and surgeons particular cruelty (I mean surgical style) when it come to how we are supposed to sleep. Anterior, posterior and lateral scars all bring their own particular delights when trying to stop doing the twist in the early hours.
So, you can arm yourself with the latest in latex support pillows, V pillows, small hand embroidered cushions that Aunty Edna gave you, mattress toppers, wedges, sleeping tablets, pain relief, whiskey cocktail or a complete hospital bed but one thing isn't going to change - your healing!
Our lives before were clock driven , getting a good night's sleep before getting up for work was imperative. Lack of sleep meant we couldn't function properly.
Now, the God of New and Shiny Hip Implants has thrown all that up in the air and we don't know where we are!
We toss and turn (very carefully) waiting for the elusive sleep that never comes or comes in annoying one hour servings. You think you have slept all night only to find that barely ten minutes has gone by since you last looked at the clock. You hobble out of bed with one eye shut, trying to fool yourself into staying asleep while you have a midnight wee and you just know that if you lie there a bit longer then YOU MUST fall asleep.
As we all know things at night are magnified to horror proportions and the sweating, the pain, the twitching, the discomfort have all become mountains we cannot climb.
So, you have read this far and you are waiting for me to give you the secret to sleeping all through the night after having part of your leg chopped off and in a position that you detest. Sorry, I don't have have those answers but what I have learned is....
This lack of sleep, is it so bad? Are you hoping to go to work in the morning? Are you leaping out of bed to go hiking, on holiday, ice sking? No.
The best cure I can find for lack of sleep is - chill out, go with it, let it happen.
Goodness knows what healing is going on inside but it doesn't confine itself to happening at night. It is imperative to rest in the first 6 weeks as it is to walk and that rest can be feet up on the sofa or a few catnaps throughout the day.
I have no problems with lack of sleep because I don't care about it.
A six weeks (today) after my 2nd THR I have learned that it is all transient. Regular sleep comes back in a position that we favour eventually and the trick is to stop worrying about it.
I sleep most of the night now, waking up between 5.30 and 6.30am. Once you find that it okay to find a sleeping place all over the house you will sleep much better as well.I was more comfortable on the sofa this time so that's where I went.
I watched all the films that no one else wanted to watch and knew that I was getting back to normal when it took me five nights to watch a film.
So, wave yourself a magic wand, stop fretting, this is temporary and I'll even go as far as to say enjoy it. For those going back to work that will come soon enough and your body regulates very quickly so in the meantime give yourself a night break, chill out - a bowl of ice cream at 3am is really rather nice!

"I was 56 years old when I had my cemented THR in March last year. It was a difficult time for me as I had just taken vol redundancy and lost my 55 yr old sister to cancer all in the space of 2 months so having been told I needed a hip replacement was devastating for me as I have been a keen runner since I was 18. So hip was replaced within a few weeks of loosing my sister.
The surgeon knew I was a very active person, as I windsurf and sail, ski etc. Since my op I have done some research and it looks as if I should have had an uncemented THR. I would like to know if any of you have a cemented THR and are you very active. As 15 months in I have problems with it in that It still feels uncomfortable, not pain but I know it's there.
I was told that when it feels like it's part of me, normal then it's healed. It might just be tendons or muscle still healing. I go to the gym 4 days a week, walk everywhere and have an allotment. I want to lead my life normally without knowing my hip has been replaced but everyday I feel it's there. Is this normal.
I am so angry that I wasn't offered an alternative method.

"hi folks my surgery for hip replacement was cancelled for April 3 and rescheduled for May 30
i had to stop taking Meloxicam which is an inflammatory drug,May 22 and since then the pain I'm experiencing is even worse. I've had a very difficult time walking even with a cane but now I can barely move at all. It's probably because that drug must have been helping keeping some pain at bay but had to stop it as per instructions at preop appointment 
the only thing that is keeping me going at the moment is the fact surgery is only a few days away. However does anyone have any ideas for relieving some of this horrible pain in both legs now. Im taking Tylenol 3 with codeine every six hours but it hardly makes a dent. I wonder if I should double up on dosage, I really don't know. Sleeping is a distant memory, I wake up at least 3 times during the night, can't sleep on either side and trying to get comfortable on my back is very hard even though I use pillows under my legs and on each side of me. I know I'm moaning a lot but could use some advice for the several days remaining prior to my surgery.

I think I am doing okay, but bothered by the thigh pain and moreso the constant ache at the top of my knee.  I  understand there was some connecting of the new hip to my femur, explaining some of the pain.  They had explained to me, before surgery, that because the surgeon had to move muscle and tissue aside to get access to the hip, there would be some discomfort.  I am getting regular PT and OT as well as visiting nurses.  We are still trying to adjust my meds, as I'm very sensitive to them.  The pain meds were making me sleep.  Trying just Tylenol for now.  Is anyone else a ""new customer"" to this procedure.

"I had my right hip replacement on April 25, 2017. I had the anterior approach.  While the surgeon was drilling in the femur bone, he cracked it. He put a clamp around it and proceeded to tell me afterwards. He also told me that he wanted me to do absolutely nothing and would not prescribe physical therapy until after my 6 week check up. 
Recovery has been wonderful!! I actually have to walk up and down the stairs 3-4 times a day. I have no restrictions. I have been walking around with only one crutch but just yesterday I was cooking in the kitchen and wasn't using the crutch at all and also forgot the crutch I was I walked 5 steps down and back up the stairs before realizing that I forgot my crutch! A little later I had a bit more pain because I think I over did it but I still feel great that I did do it!!! 
Sleeping is still a pain but I can roll on my unoperated side for awhile at night. 
I never did have the toilet raiser so that was never an issue but I still straighten it out as I go to sit. I was done with the shower chair last week. The Ted Hose were gone after the two week appointment. I was just instructed to use them on long car trips. I was able to put a sock on without any aides but it did take me like 5 minutes. 
The pain meds are on an as needed basis. I have stopped those at the second week appointment but continued to take the aspirin for clots. 
I have started on the the treadmill but I am taking it slow and will slowly increase in speed and incline. 
Well I think that's all I have at the moment so thank you for everyone's advice on thi wonderful forum and I hope to continue such great recovery with great outcomes!!!!

Since the surgery I have been diognosed with osteoarthritis of the right knee, joint hypermobility syndrome (in 11 weeks i have had 66 dislocation/sublaxes of the knee), inflammatory gum disease caused by the OA and am about to get tested for diabetes due to something coming up in a recent eye test that worried the optician.
Since my THR I have found that things with the operated hip have only become worse. The hip constently tries to sublaxe its self (a sublaxeis when the joint dislocates but then puts its self back in the joint, double the pain in seconds), I still have 0 internal rotation and my external rotation is harder than ever, I fear from mulitple surgeries that my muscles will never be the same. It has taken me a full year to be able to lift the affected leg off the bed 4cm in a lying position. I still cannot lift leg from a sitting position. And theres so much more but I wont bore you 
So on Tuesday I went for my first year check up. I expected to go get xrays, be told everything was fine ( mr surgeon refuses to listen to my protests and is quite an unfair man) and leave. Instead I got xrays, went in to see the DR (it wasnt my usual doctor that day) I told him all my worries, he did some movement tests then suddenly vanished. When he came back he said he had spoken to my Dr and they had decided they were going to do some tests. I got a blood test done and am waiting to have a CT done. He said, in his words ""we are looking for all the nasty stuff"", he mentioned infection and loosing of the joint, but wouldnt tell me anything else. But I am trying to not over worry about this as for me, set back and failure are always part of the parcel with any surgery I have, but we shall just have to wait and see what happens I suppose. But I will come on and give you an update when I get results from both blood tests and the CTscan, but that might be quite a while, as anyone in the Uk will tell you, as utterally fantastic the NHS is, sometimes you have to wait a very long time.
I truely hope that everyone else has/will had better look with their THR than I have and are moving on with their life for the better instead of numerous set backs.

I had a hip x-ray in March which showed marked loss joint space on right side and a bone spur but it wasn't really all that bad a result. IF it's my hip that's the problem all I can say is it must be a heck of a lot worse than what showed on that x-ray!
My lumber spine mri 2 years ago showed spinal stenosis. I've just had another lumbar mri to compare the two results but have to wait 2 weeks for the results. I just need to know if anyone on here also couldn't walk BEFORE their THR...i'm really scared as all this pain has come on in the last four months and I'm truly in agony. The Morphine 10 patch is no good whatsoever and the amitriptiline 10mg, iboprufen and paracetamol don't help much either. It's really hard coming to terms with all this pain that's left me totally unable to walk unaided.

"Hello again. I've only seen a physio twice since surgery - and no one else at all. I think I'm progressing quite well but physio has insisted I continue to use 2 crutches until I see the consultant in a week's time. I've finally got her to sort of agree to me using only one indoors - but that was only because she says she couldn't stop me! My question is concerning lifting up my operated leg when sitting with my legs up, fully supported. I don't know whether I should or shouldn't be trying to do this. It's easy whilst bending my knee but very difficult keeping my leg straight and hurts in my groin. 9 years ago I severed my quadriceps in this leg and had to wait 11 months (long story) for surgery to repair it. As a result my quads are not as strong in this leg and I want to make it as strong and stable as possible. Any suggestions welcome.

"Good afternoon my friends
I am 3 and half weeks on from my op and still need crutches all the time. I've tried to take a single step without having one crutch but it just doesn't happen. I'm scared I'll be like it forever!I have had to phone up my doctor to ask for physio as I've been left to my own devices since coming out of hospital. I can't get into bed on my own. I can't even get out the front door. I feel like a prisonor in effect and it's driving me into a frenzy. Then last night my thigh in my op leg started to go number on the front and side it got so bad I went to bed after 10 mins it started burning as if I'm fire but felt fine to touch I had to take oramorph to get to sleep. Today it's still semi numb what the blazes happened??? Please help?

"Hi All-
I am scheduled for a R-THR (anterior approach) on June 9th. I'm 58 but feel like I'm 98. I am worried that the surgery isn't going to eliminate my pain because I think it's coming from my back as well as my hip. My pain is in my thighs, groin, lower back and sometime shins. If I walked any slower, I'd be going backwards. The pain sometimes changes. It use to feel like sharp shards of glass were in my hip and it would kind of catch when I got up from a seated position or just walking along but now it feels a lot like muscle pain.I've been limping and compensating for the pain in different ways for awhile so I'm sure as a result everything is out of wack. I do know my arthritis has progressed and there is bone on bone so I do need the surgery but as I said, I'm nervous I'm still going to be in pain. I know I have a number of herniated discs and some stenosis. It's just hard to sort out what kind of pain it is, i.e. muscle, bone or nerve. I'm wondering what you all felt prior to the surgery and whether you felt pretty pain free after. And for those of you who had back pain too, did some of that subside?
Thanks in advance for your responses.

"Hi, My name is Justin. I was in a car accident 10 years ago. Long story short I broke my pelvis. 18 fractures. Over the years my hip has been on its way out. the last few months have been the worst. Its constantly poping in and out. I'm in line for a hip replacement and Im not too sure what to expect.
my surgeon told me the typical wait time on this type of surgery is 1 to 2 years. He said I dont have to wait. I saw him on the 9th of may and he booked me in for surgery june 9th.
He told me I would be walking asap. probably the night after surgery and out of the hospital 2-3 days later.
I have a couple questions.
1. Can I get a nerve block So I dont need morphine in the hospital
2. How long will I be in pain
3. should I do physio immediately after surgery 
4. is it easy for the hip to pop out of joint afterwards
I'm getting a ceramic style ball and socket. do they last longer?

I'm walking 15 miles without any problems , working a job which involves being on my feet . Have lost 3 1/2 stone now I can move about comfortably . All those post op discomforts and worries seem a world away now -so we do all get there in the end - I do think it takes a year for optimum recovery and to stop being aware of every step you take !

"Hi
I had my second hip replaced one week ago and it was a complex operation due to deformities left behin by Perthes disease. The operation took 3.5hrs and bone grafts were required.
  I am recovering well but I am now certain that my latest operation has resulted in a leg length 10-12mm longer than the other.
   I havent seen the post op physio yet and would appreciate any advice from anyone who has had a similar experience. Do I go back to the surgeon ? or is it the physio who will put things in place ?. I am guessing heel lifts will be the solution but dont know really

"Hi everyone
I am 6 months post op and doing very well .No serious problems..
Trouble is getting too confident and forgetting I have a prosthesis which is vulnerable to falls etc.
Long befoire I even needed a thr I used to fall over a lot!!
Following my op. I was extremely cautious,watched where I walked,even carrying a stick (just in case).
I am currently in North Cyprus where health and safety are non-existent.
Guess what,I forgot my walking stick,which is inside the door at home.
I have been so proud of walking with care up to 15000 steps, negotiating uneven pavements cars parked on pavements piles of building rubble,every hazard possible,till now!!
Just rushing up from the pool to my flat for the loo,I went sprawling ,grazing both shins on rough dirty brick steps,blood pouring from my left leg.
I am so mad with myself having been so careful till now.
My worry is infection.!!
Before thr I would have thought nothing of a minor accident and been back in the pool with a plaster on the graze.
Dear fellow hippies tell me am I being ridiculous or is infection from minor cuts and grazes a real problem?
Being away from home with no-one to ask I am probably a little paranoid.
What do you all think?
Other than my own stupidity my hip replacement has been great so far,just a few aches and pains in the buttock area from time to time.
Just hope I haven't messed things up.
Please advise if you have thoughts on the subject.I am just aware that the prothesis is not up to protecting itself as a natural joint can.
Wishing all of you the very best,whatever stage you are at. Take care and mind how you go.

I am now four weeks post surgery and thought I would share my progress.
I have been free of painkillers for two weeks, and finished my Clexane (blood thinning injections) last Friday.
I can walk outside with one crutch, and managed a couple of shopping trips with my wife.
The downside is I have what appears to be a muscle spasm in the thigh of my non-operated leg.  I have had this since a couple of days post surgery.  I visited my GP who diagnosed Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome.  It is causing me more concern than my operated leg.
Has anyone else come across this?  I am told it should go away of its own accord.

"This week I have had my second hip replaced ( 1st one Feb 17 ) due to Perthes disease as a boy. The Perthes had caused flattening of femur head which then caused the pelvis to develop a flattened cup ( acetabulum ) too. Aa a consequence when the surgeon needed to form a hollow for the replacement acetabulum there wasnt really enough depth in the pelvic bone to accommodate this and so a bone graft was used to build up an area of the pelvis to provide support for the new cup. The main intention being to build a stronger pelvis which will improve the success of revision surgery and also to lessen the chances of early failure of the new hip.
   If there is anyone out there who has any knowledge of how bone grafts affect the outcome of THRs or has had a similar experience please reply

"I went in for my total hip replacement on June 6th of 2013. When I awoke I had a tingly numbing sensation from my knee down to my foot. It turns out I ended up with what is called foot drop. My surgeon Dr. Gallagher said he was pretty sure he didn't cut my sciatic nerve but he might have stretched it some. I had physical therapists come and strap a foot brace on me and walk me around the hospital. When I was time for me to be discharged the physical therapists didn't send me home with a foot drop brace instead one showed up at my house later that week. I wore it only when I was out shopping or at therapy. It felt snug on me it felt tight. I went walking with my girlfriend one day and kept the brace on for 2 hours by the time we made it back to the car my calf where the brace strapped on was really red and sore. I went to the ER and was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. I also was diagnosed with diastolic dysfunction stage 2 peripheral vascular disease and atrial fibrillation. Almost 2 months after my hip replacement I am back in the hospital. When I got out my physical therapist told me of a place that custom makes AFOs so me and my girlfriend went there. The guy that worked there said he don't know why they bordered the over the counter foot drop brace because he knew it would be to small. Well my life was ruined. I had a great job with awesome insurance. My weight was good. Now I am 85 lbs. bigger and draw permanent disability. When you are sitting there listening to your surgeon say that you will be back to work in 3 months and you will be playing gulf and dancing. Lol don't always believe what you hear.

"I am 14 months post THR.
As well as some residual pelvic obliquity and torsion (which I had prior to the op) I have an actual LLD of around 8mm (as measured on a chiropractic standing x-ray).
I am struggling with back ache on the non operated short leg side, (which may also be being caused by psoas issues and hip impingement on that side). I am tying to understand how much of this backache is being caused by the actual LLD, and whether anyone out there has had a similar LLD which they have managed to assimilate/absorb.
I started wearing orthotics a couple of months ago which did seem to help at first.
I am working hard at my mental attitude to all of this, and so am interested in empirical evidence re whether it is actually possible to deal with this amount of LLD after THR in a relatively pain free way. Once I believe it is possible, then I can relax into following the therapists advice in getting it sorted.
Any comments gratefully received.

the big problems are that im unable to fully weigh bear on my op leg. it hurts and is too weak so i have no hope of ditching the crutches or even dropping to just one. im religously doing the exercises but cannot open my hip very far due to the extremely tight abductor tendon. it just wont let up. if i bend my knee up when lying down and allow it to drop outwards it just wont go beyond about 25 degrees. i know its all because my leg has been lengthened by an inch but dont know how im supposed to adapt to that if my muscles/tendons are too tight to work.

"I have had my left hip loint replaced 3 times the lst two because I broke the implants playing golf. My consultant told me it was OK to carry on playing so I did, however I have detected a clicking type feeling with my fingers. This feeling is towards the front of my thigh about level with my groin. Is this going to be connected to my hip again or could it be something else???. I have stopped playing until I see the consultant.

"Happy Easter! I posted a month or so ago about my long wait for hip replacement..surgeon retired, 4 months for appointment with new surgeon unable to meet the timescales given in the letters twice, then told his list was actually a year. I am in so much pain and rarely leave the house, being fortunate I work from home helps, i went to GP to see if he could suggest or swing anything in my favour..he suggested I contact MSP. I did and lo and behold I have appointent with a new surgeon in Golden Jubilee Hospital in glasgow and a preoperative date 2 days after that. Both 1st week in May. No date for op, but feeling it might be soon as surely wouldnt do a preop a long time before op. Though given the previous debacle, I am optimistically hopefull it might be soon but until I get op date still not totally confident was january 2016 my original consultant said I needed to have it done..so a year and 4 months down the line things are very bad with other things all deteriorated more than should have, but I am seeing light ahead in the tunnell. Anyway apart from sharing do people agree it cant be long after preop as blood tests etc need be up to date?

"Hi All, My second post and I'm stressing. I've been doing flooring for 30 years (Since a freshman in high school) It's all I know and I love it still mainly because of the thrill I get out of seeing all your faces after I come and put in your new hardwood floor or custom carpet. Nevertheless, It's all I know. My doctor says ""you'll never go back to kneeling"".
My question is focused to the post-op patients who have been able to bend further than 90 degrees. In all actuality I rarely bend further than that and would like to know what kind of feedback I would get if I asked this community - You really can't ever bring your knee to your chest again?
I'm 6' 4"" 190lbs not an ounce of fat on my body and have always healed incredibly fast - I was out of my shoulder sling before my first check up after shoulder surgery for a destroyed laberum. I deep sea fish, metal detect, ride quads with my kids (6 & 10) and a certified skydiver. Does this all go away including my career?
I admire all of you for your courage and wisdom but please no ""on the fence"" responses - I'm looking for sucess stories for bending to see if anyone can.
Thank you and my best to you all,

I'm worried about the future of my hemiarthroplasty as a THR in a few years is very daunting and I  would love to know if there's an alternative.  I'm 55 and although I have MS I'm a lot fitter than they've given me credit for and I only really found out what I'd had done after it was over as there wasn't much discussion beforehand.  This site is great for info. so thought I'd give it a go. There must be others who want an alternative to a total revision other than a life on strong pain killers.

I walk the block every day with 2 crutches, I do the physio exercises 3 times a day as instructed. I take paracetamol and ibuprofen as pain management and it keeps under control. Today I am tired because I went for a longer walk with a friend but I'm seeing through the fog gradually. I phoned the hospital and was asking if it's normal to feel all the things. They reassured me and I feel better now. When it's going to rain I know it cos I have a dull ache!! I hope you are all recovering nicely.

I had a full blood test three weeks ago which showed I could have kidney disease so have to have it repeated next week. I googled ""high kidney creatinine"" and one of the side effects for this was taking NSAIDS over a long period. Last week I had a UTI and was prescribed an antibiotic. I  have never had problems with my kidneys/bladder so I decided to stop taking iboprufen or naproxen to see if my creatinine level would have gone down in my next blood test in two weeks time.
Recently I found that leaning over a supermarket trolley helped enormously with my walking so I bought myself a 3 wheel walker to lean on in my home going from room to room. (I have to use a mobility scooter when i go out). I read somewhere that exercising/walking as much as possible before a THR helped people so yesterday I decided to walk around as much as possible WITHOUT pain killers and WITHOUT too much support eg: I got off my scooter and walked into shops I couldn't otherwise have gone into.This caused me a heck of a lot of pain but I soldiered on. I was in soooo much pain when I got home but I never imagined this pain would keep me awake all night long. I was in agony.
At 3am I gave in and took 2 iboprofen, 2 paracetamol, 10mg of diazepam, and put on a 10 mg morphine patch. That looks a lot I agree but I had gone two days taking nothing but 2 paracetamols every 4 hours which did nothing. My morphine patch had needed replacing but I hadn't. I was so scared that the iboprufen might have caused the creatinine rise I had stopped taking that too.
I finally went off to sleep and woke up pain free. I couldn't believe I had actually slept. The pain's back now when I stand but not when I sit and I definitely can't weight-bear on the bad leg. I just wondered if anyone else has had kidney blood test abnormalities and anyone else who has excruciating pain on lying down in bed at night. What IS the answer?!

"Hi all!! I had a RTHR on Tuesday. They let me go home yesterday.. The surgeon told me that it went alright but that he had cracked my femur putting in my replacement. He said that I was much smaller than he thought and as he was drilling into the femur, it cracked. He said that he put a ""clamp"" like deal around it and that it should heal as the hip is healing... I am still taking a lot of my pain meds. He doesn't want me to do a lot until the 6 week mark but I'm still doing the exercises that I was shown in the hospital. I use a walker and my crutches (kind of like them both). Ice is still my best friend and as much as I like to be totally out of pain, the pain meds keep dropping my blood pressure, last blood pressure was 89/55, so trying to be cautious as I can't be up while those are in affect due to the dizziness and wanting to pass out.

Then a couple of weeks ago I started getting pains in my new hip joint and now I'm having to use a stick again and painkillers to walk. It only hurts intermittently, and only when I put weight on that leg - I'm fine when sitting or lying down, which makes me think it can't be an infection. Does anyone have any ideas what might be going on? I've made an appoontment with my surgeon, but the earliest  I could get is in 10 days time. Should I keep trying to walk etc or rest up till then?

"Hi All
I'm a 42 year old mum of 4 who's just found out that I was born with hip dysplasia which has caused OA in my right hip. I thought I had a groin strain that wasn't healing but after physio hadn't helped, I was x rayed and OA diagnosed. My consultant says I need a THR and this can be done when I believe quality my life is affected sufficiently on a daily basis. 
My husband and family think I should have it done sooner rather than later as I have deteriorated so much in the last 12 months. However, I am finding it difficult to rationalise as I don't feel I'm in 'enough pain' to warrant it just yet. My consultant tells me that I don't have that long to wait and there will come a time when the decision will be out of my hands. He also gave me all the negatives of surgery which didn't inspire me to go ahead. He says there's a  forever risk of dislocation and you can't ever bend past 90 degrees or crouch down. 
I had a steroid injection in December and the effects were amazing but that was as a diagnosis and indicator of how a THR would feel not really a long term remedy. I am still feeling some of the benefits but it has worn off significantly. 
I can however still walk my dog every day and I swim twice a week to keep my muscles strong. I do feel pain in my hip/groin/buttock all day/every day but can cope with this. My mobility is affected and I struggle to bend down, put socks on etc. 
My my husband thinks I should go for it now as my consultant says it's an option and why wait for things to get worse but I'm struggling with that as I don't feel it's bad enough and what if the after isn't as good as I'm hoping. 
Everyone's advice says go for it now, it's the best thing that's happened but how bad we're people before?? What if it's not the best thing to do?

"Hi All!
First I appreciate any insight and wisdon you can give me on this.
I had Anteriior THR on my left hip on March 22nd 2017 and was released from the hospital on the 24th after performing all the actions my surgeon said would give evidence that I was ready for discharge.  My surgeon said I was released without any restrictions and could do anything I wanted up and to the point of causing pain. 
So I get home and things are going so well.  I am able to bend over and pick things up off the floor without pain and the limp I had for so many years was completely gone. I was very reserved and decided not to climb stairs until after my first appointment after sugery.
On the 15th day after the surgery I am in the kitchen fixing a glass of tea(I have my cane). On my way back to the living room I begin to feel a sharp pain in my left groin.  By the time I had traveled the dozen steps or so to the living room I was in excrutiating pain.  The pain was the worst that I can ever recall experiencing (I have had 1/2 dozen broken bones) it literally had me in tears by the time I traveled from my chair in the living room to my bed room; about 20 steps or so.
I didn't feel a pull or a snap or anything when the groin pain appeared and the fact that it got so bad so quickly has me completely befuddled.
I called the surgeons office and they said to stay off of it for a week and then give them another call.  I followed their instructions and a week later the pain is about 80% of what it was so they tell me to stay off ot it for another week and call back.  That was yesterday.
As it stands now, I cannot use a walker as I cannot take any weight on the left leg at all.  I rented a wheel chair and that I how I get to the bathroom.
I am on 10Mgs of oxycodone every 4 hours and I also take two Excedrin Extra Strength which seems to really help.   I am not able to lay horizontal for more than about 90 minutes and then I have to sit in a chair in order for the pain to come under control.  Over the last 4 nights I have been sleeping in my chair in order to try and get some sleep.
I don't feel any grinding or popping when I move to my wheel chair and did not prior to getting my wheel chair when I was using a walker.  Just the groin pain that is very severe and runs down the thigh to about the knee.
Any ideas?
I am scheduled to go to the surgeon's tomorrow, but don't believe I can make the 4 steps down to the garage from my kitchen to make it to my SUV.
I will let you all know what the surgeon says after my appointment, but what I don't understand is how I could be doing so well for over a week and then suddenly be basically crippled without the use of my leg.
Thank you again for any help!

"I had a THR 12 days ago and would love suggestions as to how to cope with buttock cramp after doing some of the exercises - it is so painful that I have to stop. I'm a sufferer from cramp anyway and on quinine on a daily basis. Also it would be good to hear what is 'average' recovery at this stage and then weekly through to 6 and then 13 weeks. I'm on crutches, managing stairs and can walk a little using one crutch only - but not for long. I'm following the physios advice re exercise but any tips would be very helpful. Thanks

"Hello all. I am 7 weeks post op now and my surgeon was puzzled by my pain and swelling in the side of my leg (by the hip) and said it looked distended. My osteopath confirmed that it was distended. My osteopath recommended I get an aqua jogger and practice ""running"" in the deep end of a pool, to activate the front muscles to try to pull it in again.
Has anyone else suffered a distended hip post surgery? It would be so good to hear. Mine's only an inch or so, perhaps a bit less, but it means I can't wear jeans or anything! (Jeans were my staple clothing, I'm a mum with little children!!)

"Greetings All,
Newly registered here and seeking all the information I can find regarding Total Hip Replacement Surgery.  I am 62 in June of this year and in mostly good health other than the bum hip- osteo arthritis so the prognosis seems inevitable.  Guess what 40 years of physical labor, over exertion and all the various injuries that come with the territory will add up to.  Currenty in PT 2X weekly,  with weekly deep tissue work for the past two weeks have at least gotten me ambulatory and reduces pain and most symptoms to the bearable but the plans for tramping around in foriegn locales during retirement are shot unless I get this fihured out.  Self employed most of my working life, only health insurance I ever had was a gym membership that I used so the costs of the surgery are an element I can't ignore.  My best option seems to be to find the surgery out of my native USA and I would be most gratefull to hear of anyones experience, opinions, advise or comments for this.  If there is a specific thread on this discussion your direction to find it also welcome.  Search function didn't get me there.
Best to All,

I am now 4 weeks after a posterior THR (right) and able to walk without crutches on even ground but, the operated leg is definitely longer than the other, consequently I have a somewhat rolling gait.  My right knee is painful too.  Apparently the op was difficult because of a twisted femur. 
I'd be interested to know if anyone else has this problem and whether or not it is likely to diminish.  Does/can the new hip 'bed down' into the femur?

"Here are son's takes on the new orthopedic surgeon (he moved from the midwest to the west coast). 
- He's old
- He's ready to retire, so he gives odd answers
  (almost as if he didn't care)
So for the long list of questions - here they are:
- Do I have any restrictions about lifting objects? 
- Are there any restrictions that are permanent, and if so....why?
- Can I sit on the floor cross-legged if it doesn't hurt?
- Am I allowed to do squatting exercises?
- I still have swelling? Is that a concern? What should I do about it?
- What signs or symptoms should worry me if they occur?
- When should I return for my next follow-up?
He didn't have answers.
Now THERE'S a doctor you don't need to see again!
Here's the ONE interesting thing. They did an x-ray and the right leg is 6mm longer than the left. The surgeon in the midwest said they're the same.
In other news, he saw a new physical therapist who says his underlying musculature on the right (9 mos post-surgery) is only 60% of that of the left. The sports medicine doctor he saw said it was his hip flexors which were weak. Now he has some exercises, so can get into a routine and make some progress!
Thanks all, hope you are doing well in your hip journeys. 
BTW, I tripped & fell, sprained my shoulder, so now I am on my own journey!

"Hi all
Im new here and looking for some help. Ok, I'm 56 and had THR nearly 4 weeks ago.
Two things:
1) did anyone 'feel the joint' almost when you sit down? I'm aware sometimes when i sit down (not lay down) that I've got the foreign joint in there. Does this sensation last long?
2) i was on crutches for 2 week, then attended physio at the hospital, given sticks and told that when i felt ready i could use them. I started with 2 then within 3 days decided that i could manage with 1. I went out (down 5 flights of large stairs) walked about quite a bit and had lunch. When I stood up it was like a horrible opposite back pain, operated side knee and hips pain and huge soreness all over.
Im now back on 2 crutches and feet up.
I'm aware of the 6 week back to work allowance. I'm a teacher. I'm worried I've pulled or strained something.
Do things really move along a pace healingwise once the 4 weeks post op time comes along as I'm concerned.
Anything you have to advise I'd be grateful for.

I still touch base on the forum now & again but generally my life has returned to normal (9 months post-op) & I'm as busy as ever at work.
I am so thankful that my op has been a complete success with a fantastic recovery & i often forget I've even had a THR (it still seems quite surreal)!
My surgeon did say that I would eventually have to have my other hip replaced but I should be OK for a few years. Lo & behold I've been getting an occasional twinge (more so if I've been out walking for a good few miles with my dog) & I'm beginning to wonder if I'll last a few more years! I'm not really in any pain & don't have to take any pain relief but I know what's coming! One thing's for sure, I won't delay the inevitable for 2 years like last time!

It seems to come on more after being outside in the cold wind. Does cold weather normally cause this feeling or does it sound like an infection.

"Hi Guys, I got home from the hospital yesterday 15th, Had my left hip replaced on the wednesday (12th) Operation was delayed, was meant to have it on the Tuesday 11th but the machinery wasn't working lol typical.
Anyway they kept me on the ward overnight instead of sending me home again as I live 40 miles away form the hospital and they didn't want to lose my theatre slot.
I went into surgery at about 12 lunch time on wednesday and was brought round about 4:30pm...the pain was really bad but was well managed with lots of strong pain relief.
The physio team got me up and walking on Thursday morning with a walker and I was able to get myself in and out of bed...sleeping was uncomfortable and I still had leg ache which I know not is due to not enough medication.
Friday pretty much the same but was shown how to use a helping hand to get dressed and how to use toilet seat and crutches. 
On Saturday I mastered the stairs and was ready to go home, discharge took ages because of the time it takes to get the medication together...I finally got home around 8pm!
Before I had my surgery I had a leg lenght discrepancy of about 2-3 inches at a guess and now both my legs are the same length give or take a cm maybe which feels amazing as I have pretty much always walked with a limp and now hopefully I will not anymore.
I am so happy I have finally had this done after all the hickups iv'e had to get here..the next 6 weeks will be the longest and hardest of my life but I know it will be worth it.
Thanks to everyone on here for reading my posts and giving me advice you have all been so supportive and now hopefully I can help out others who are brave enough to have this surgery..xx

I've been walking 3 miles 3 times a week and with my limp it becomes painful to the point that I have to stop and sit down before I can continue. My hip is almost bone on bone and it hasn't bothered me too much but since the surgery it has been causing me pain. My doc said to continue walking because it won't deteriorate the hip any faster.
My operated hip is fabulous.

I am one of the people with long term knumbness as well. The Dr sent me away to recover and seemingly was improving. Recently I over did some stoop work and have experienced a lower back pain that seems to aggravate the hip discomfort. From my right butt dimple to my right big toe and including the hip area, knumbnes, pulling, and or warm discomfort. It is not a pain beyond my lower back, just a weird feeling. Except for some occasional clunking the hip seems fine and there is no hip ""pain"". Sound familiar?

"Hi everyone I'm so sorry that all of you are in this message board, dealing with pain, my 26 year old had to have bilateral hip replacement surgery 10 years ago, after a stem cell transplant to save him from high risk ALL leukemia. He developed avascular necrosis from the steroids, chemo and radiation. His left hip has given him problems since the surgery it seems the doctors always say that there's nothing wrong with it. The last three years it's been getting worse. I have taken into orthopedist and specialists they've tested his blood for Metals they've done X-rays and MRIs and tell us they can't find anything wrong. And he tells me the pain runs from the top back of his thigh under his butt and runs down to his knee and through to the front of his knee he can feel the pain ramping up and when it gets bad he's unable to walk for a couple of days without the use of a cane or sometimes a walker. I have been calling different doctors and Specialists that we've met over the last 10 years and while he was sick there were many times that I figured out complications that the doctors didn't but I feel at a loss. My son is afraid to get a new hip replacement because what if that pain is worse than what he's already dealing with. Plus he's still so young you can only get so many hip replacements throughout your life. I'm just hoping to find someone else it has circumstances similar to his. I wish you all the best and I agree with statements that say follow your instincts you are generally right the doctor's maybe we'll intended but they only see you for a tiny slice of time, they don't understand the situation the way you do.

"Aloha, all. I can't remember when I was last here - perhaps 6 months? My son is the double hippie. LTHR March 8, 2016. RTHR July 5, 2016. For the first, he had GA, felt no pain & took MONTHS to climb out of the fog. For the second, spinal & immediately in horrific pain in the recovery room. He weaned off opioids within 2 weeks for both. Everyone is different, but for him the painkiller side effects were almost worse than the pain.
A lot has happened since the last op. I helped him relocate from the heartland to the west coast. I've been back in Hawaii for 2 months. Just yesterday, son said he's only now feeling more normal in terms of clarity. He still does get fatigued after walking more than 5 blocks or uphill. He hasn't had effective physical therapy, but that is a whole other story for another time.
Son sees a new orthopedist (because he's in a new town) for his a-bit-over-one-year-mark on Wednesday, so any ideas on questions to ask this surgeon are much appreciated. Here are a few I thought relevant:
- Do I have any restrictions about lifting objects? 
- Are there any restrictions that are permanent, and if so....why?
- Can I sit on the floor cross-legged if it doesn't hurt?
- Am I allowed to do squatting exercises?
- I still have swelling? Is that a concern? What should I do about it?
- What signs or symptoms should worry me if they occur?
- When should I return for my next follow-up?

This week I decided that I'd try giving up using my stick as I'd only been using it to give me confidence. I've cut down on my pain meds as I keep forgetting to take them so I figured I didn't need them. I went back to work at 10 weeks which was tiring but on a phased return which helped. Then yesterday I got on and rode my horse for the first time since the op which was wonderful even though we only walked around the school under supervision. I had no ill effects which was great.
I've also lost a stone in weight which was much needed and I feel so much better for it. I was given a healthy eating plan which I still follow as you can lose 1lb each week.
I still do all my exercises morning and evening and massage my scar with moisturiser every day which helps.
Some days I even forget that I've had the op as things are so good and I'm walking with no pain and no limp. My life is getting back to normal.
I hope that my experience gives those of you still in the early stages either pre or post op some encouragement that things will get better and your life will get back to a pain free normality.

"Hi everyone,
I posted 5-6 months ago about my experience with failed hip arthroscopy (2013), and low level of arthritis - so 4 different hip surgeons I consulted with did not feel confident that I would have a successful total hip replacement.
On April 3 2017 I had 2nd hip scope, surgeon found ""a bit"" of calcification and scar tissue at front of the joint. He says it *may* explain some of the pain I had after the 1st hip scope, but he's not sure. He found no significant arthritis.  (therefore, I'm still not a great candidate for THR!)
Recovery is much easier this time. The real test will be how i feel in 6 months, then 1-2 years from now...  I'm following the PT protocol, hoping the tendonitis & pain that occurs when sitting will subside. I don't know if/when I'll be able to ride an exercise bike, sitting and pedaling will hurt, but I want to try it.
What I'm really frustrated with, for all of us, is what are the options for older patients with confirmed labral tear + small amount of visible arthritis? Why do we have to stay in limbo (and in pain & disability) until joint space degrades? Is it truly a crapshoot to skip hip scope and go straight to THR?  If the answer is yes, can they explain why this is so? 
I consulted with 4 hip surgeons who do THR, and none of them could explain why, they just cited national data. (Well, I can't argue with that, I want to hear the data!)  Then they left it up to me to decide, saying ""Well, it MIGHT help you, odds are 30-50% of good outcome"".
Yikes.
I just wonder if the implants for THR are designed specifically for people who already have advanced arthritis. But even so, the procedure for THR is to grind out any remaining cartilage (labrum), so in effect that erases your joint space altogether, which is like advanced arthritis (to my feeble layman's mind, anyway).

I thought that after my hip was replaced I would be able to go work and walk a lot and enjoy life to the full again. How wrong was I?
I really don't know what will happen next. Does anyone else have these problems? I feel quite alone

"Hello - I had a total right hip replacement on 8th April 2017, and I have managed to cut painkillers down to taking Paracetamol four times a day.  My problem at the moment besides sleep is an intermittent severe burning sensation in the thigh of my left leg.  It started about four days after surgery and my doctor said it could be referred pain.  Anyone had a similar experience.
thanks

"Hi gang, all going along nicely.  Stitches still on track to come out Wednesday.  PT is transitioning me from walker to cane (started Friday).  Here is my question - did any / many / most of you feel more achy (hurt), sore (thigh) when you first tried using a cane (one stick)?   Today I pretty much sat almost all day, did not do many exercises but I did manage a 16-minute walk (current goal is to get to 30-minute walk - boy does it wear me out).
And good heavens when does the nausea end?  (I have meds for it)

"Hi all
Im new here and looking for some help. Ok, I'm 56 and had THR nearly 4 weeks ago.
Two things:
1) did anyone 'feel the joint' almost when you sit down? I'm aware sometimes when i sit down (not lay down) that I've got the foreign joint in there. Does this sensation last long?
2) i was on crutches for 2 week, then attended physio at the hospital, given sticks and told that when i felt ready i could use them. I started with 2 then within 3 days decided that i could manage with 1. I went out (down 5 flights of large stairs) walked about quite a bit and had lunch. When I stood up it was like a horrible opposite back pain, operated side knee and hips pain and huge soreness all over.
Im now back on 2 crutches and feet up.
I'm aware of the 6 week back to work allowance. I'm a teacher. I'm worried I've pulled or strained something.
Do things really move along a pace healingwise once the 4 weeks post op time comes along as I'm concerned.
Anything you have to advise I'd be grateful for.
Thanks

"After a fall ten weeks ago when I fractured my hip I am recovering from a total hip replacement which was promptly done the day after the accident.
The wound is still quite painful around the area although it has healed well.
i do get an uncomfortable feeling in the groin on occasions.  I still sleep on my back as it is uncomfortable to try and get on my side, I wake up really aching, especially in my back which was bad before I had the fall, I'm 75 on Sunday by the way.
i do walk nearly every day outside with one crutch, I also drive again but it aches if I am stuck in traffic using the clutch all the time.
Really I suppose I have done well in the time, I'm just wondering how other people manage to get back to sleeping on their sides, I'm frightened of dislocating my new hip.

"Hi all,
It's been months since I've been here, have been busy going about my life at regular speed.  But..........in the past several weeks I have had increasing groin pain that at first just attributed to maybe a fluke, and have had some popping. (although very little of that)  Yesterday I went to get into our Van (Passenger side) and upon lifting my surgical leg up to slide in an excruciating pain shot through my hip and leg, and I actually let out a few screams with pain.  Could not (or was too afraid to as well) continue to get in.  Upon resting it all evening and sleeping well it is much better today, but still slightly sore.  Put it this way, I know it's there when walking, but am still walking without cane or assistance as before.  Don't know what to make of this since it's come on recently and didn't have any of this prior to the past month.  Must confess, I haven't been very good with my at home excersises but have been active doing ALMOST everything I did prior to arthritic hip.  At first, husband and I were terrified that maybe it was dislocated, and I do plan on calling Doc and getting in asap, but instinctively I feel it is muscular or ligament or whatever problem.  Am walking today just fine but gingerly. I am babying it because it is just a very little sore, but?  I am thinking if it would be a REAL problem, I wouldn't be moving like I am and able to move it in most all directions AT ALL. Anyone have any knowledge of this kind of thing happening at this stage? (7 months out)  What do you all think?  Anyone with any experience of this, I would appreciate hearing what your thoughts are. 
Happy Easter to all!

"I had my right hip replaced 15 months ago. I was saying goodnight to my daughter kneeling down and turned off her lamp twisting and my left hip (as yet not replaced) kind of snapped, I felt a terrible pain as if a very large tooth was being wrenched out, and now I am limping very badly. My left hip has been playing up for a while (it keeps me awake at night with the pain - the 'toothache' pain we are all recognise, and I find long days quite painful) but apart from that I have been managing really well. My right hip went downhill very quietly and this certainly didn't happen.
The snapping feeling was horrible, I couldn't stand up afterwards and now am finding it hard to even sit down and stretch it, it feels completely different to before. Has anyone else had this experience?

"Having had my THR I asked the insurance company how long it would be before I could legally drive.
They were non committal and usggested that either 1) I ask my GP to sign me off or 2) I ask my Consultant to do the same. In each of the to opions I felt that both GP and Onsultant would be under enough pressure with clinical work rather than deal with a patients request to drive a car.
My Consultant in the pre op process did state that 6 weeks was appropriate but that it was up to the individual and I felt safe after 3 weeks due to a speedy recovery period.
In one of the Forum discusions it was stated that it was illegal to drive within 6 weeks which I do not believe to be the case.

"Hi all 
I've been on h forum a number of times but now have a specific question.
A neighbour had her RTHR done 4 weeks before me- so in February - said that at follow-up she had been advised to lie on the operation site at night ""if possible"" to help loosen / get more circulation to the scar site and all the tissues below, which presumably then fibrose if they are not directly contacted or rubbed or whatever..  
I haven't seen any discussion about this.  Another neighbour who is an Alexander teacher has recommended a 'scar specialist' in a nearby town and I'm wondering whether to book an appointment.
I have reached 4 & a half weeks, and the only problems I have now are (still) bruising on the back of the leg especially the knee, and a feeling of tightness around the scar.
Any comments gratefully received.  I am seeing physio this week too.
Many thanks

"Any keen skiers out there?
I had my right hip replaced last July, and I was lucky, I had a very straight forward recovery.
Last week I was back on my skis, and my hip felt perfectly normal. I discussed skiing with my surgeon, and he was ok with it. Told me to be careful and send him a photo! (He has a good sense of humour..)
I was very careful, stayed on the piste, avoided black runs and bumps, and also bought some shorts with body armour, like layers of rubber, for protection. I think free style skiers wear them. (Not that I was doing any stunts!) I also only skied when it was sunny and visibility was good.
So if you like skiing, and are reasonably proficient, having a THR needn't mean the end of your skiing.
Wishing all you hippies a good recovery if you are at the early stages. For most of us it does get a lot better.

"Ladies,
I could really use some advice on this one. Any advice on how to reintroduce intimacy back into the marriage after a total hip replacement? Landry was last April, which prohibited me from abducting since that time. We found other ways to keep the relationship going, however, it has put a strain with limited intimacy. The other ways included me lying on my left hip, which is my operated hip. It's been 8 weeks since surgery and while I do have increased range of motion I am very concerned about dislocation.
At a very healthy 58 it is important that we reactivate this piece of our relationship.

"I'm 33 and I have had my right hip hurting me since as long as I can remember, I been through all sorts of pain medication, tens unit, hip injectstions, physical therapy, chiropractor. I seen doctor after doctor. Had muplutiple mri, cat scans, it wasn't until last year they did a arthrogram a found I had a labral tear. I went and had arthroscopic surgery to fix the tear, they used anchors with partial detriment and fixed an impingment, they noted I had some cartilage damage but no arthritis. Since then I completed physical therapy, but my hip has been worse, it still feels like it pinches, it locks, my leg buckles, my pain is only in the front part. It pops and it is incredibly painful. I can't sit for long periods or stand, it feels full and lots of pressure. I have tried everything from foam rolling, to pain medications to tens unit, acupuncture, physical therapy. I can't do it any more, I went back to my doctor they redid a arthrogram but they did not find anything wrong. I'm beside myself. On average my hip will pop up to 10 sometimes 20 times a day out almost feels like it is out of place. What should I do? Any thoughts of what this could be? They did x- rays nothing, the only thing they mention is I have mild dysplasia of that hip, I even went to see someone who does PAOs and I didn't not qualify. Any suggests would be much appreciated.

I'm almost week 5 after THR and I'm ok, walking with 1 crutch (occasional step withno crutch but instructed by physio not yet). However, I do still have some swelling very localised on the side of the hip, and it's really hot and really inflamed. I have to get up for my kids in the night it doubles its inflammation and feels so burny. I had an anterior approach and my surgeon tells me to sleep on my side with a cushion between my knees but that is WAY to painful! It really pulls and burns more.
I am taking anti-inflammatories (prescription), but just wondered if anyone else still had this at week 5? I am definitely get the sensations back in my thigh (less numbness) and the groin pain is very intermittent now, it's just this burning swelling on the hip that I'm wondering about.

I had my 8 week consultant review yesterday, it was all mostly positive. I can now swim including breaststroke, I can drive, my scar has healed beautifully. Haematoma is still there, that's to be left alone,hopefully will disappear eventually.
However I felt a little bit let down,I still walk with one crutch,which I swapped to a stick yesterday. The registrar said to me that most people could walk fine at this stage without anything. Iv tried around the house so many times and just walk with a ridiculous limp. I don't feel confident outside without a stick.
The stick is making me walk better,he told me to take longer strides,physio was offered but he said could take weeks. I have booked in with a private physio tomorrow,to improve my limp and I'm hoping to loose the stick eventually.
Has anyone had anything similar at this stage? I thought I had progressed well. It would be great to hear back with any advice or experience of this. Thank-you in advance.

I haven't been on for a while - I have been travelling and enjoying a life I could not imagine without my last THP. It was a great success in the end. I hope you are all getting there with your recoveries at various stages, the long road that it is.
My left hip will need to be replaced, I am trying to put this off for as long as possible least of all due to my age ( now an old lady at 42 just turned!) but just lately it is really keeping me awake at night prompting my memory of the terrible bone toothache in my hip I had last time. I am not quite in need of a hip replacement just yet, I know the stages now from last time. I can shop for a little while without aching too much, and I am only limping at the end of the day - and I can still get in and out of the car! So not too bad just yet. 
What I would LOVE to know if there is anything that worked to keep your hip going for longer? My last hip went downhill so fast there was no real time to look into alternatives, and I was completely in denial about how bad it was, I somewhat missed the boat. This time though I don't feel quite so scared and now wonder if there is more I could do to help keep my left hip going????
I know nothing can stop a THP once it is needed the last shred of mobility evaporates like the morning mist, but it would be lovely to know if there is anything I can do this time around to stretch it out....

"Hi all. I had my hip replaced 6 months ago and I have been getting back ache in the lower back. I had been getting the pain for many year before my op and I had put it down to my gait, but I still have it, so my doctor sent me for an MRI to find out what is going on.
2 days ago I had my 6 month check up with the consultant at the hospital and she told me the results of my MRI. I was shocked to find out that I have faset joint arthritis, disc prolapse and will need my right hip replacing because of the arthritis in there also and i need to go to a spine hospital for an injection into my spine.
I came home from hospital and called my doctor, he asked what the consultant said about the MRI and after I told him. He said he was shocked because to him it didn't look bad at all and he didn't think I had fast joint arthritis. So now I am totally confused as to who I believe, the specialist consultant or my GP.

Getting to potty chair much better than at first..........so I know that is improvement.  2 days ago PT (physical therapist) came for second time, guess I tototally over did it...........I slept all day and all night, couldn't seem to get rested. 
Im much better this a.m.  Waiting on nurse to change the bandage.  PT comes this afternoon!  I did walk with walker down the hall and back

"My twenty year old total hip replacement is due to be replaced early in May due to the poly having worm out. At the same time my surgeon is going to swap the ball with a new one.
I'm trying to get some idea of what other's experience is of the severity of the surgery and how the length of the recovery compared to the original surgery. What age were you when you had your original surgery and what was it for the revision. An idea of your fitness and BMI index and any other relevant factors would be much appreciated.
Many thanks. Richard

"Hi all,
I posted on here approx 2 months ago as I was in two minds as to whether to go ahead with THR at 45.  I had some fab advice from members and 2 weeks ago had the surgery.  I'm very happy with the results, clips out today, physio today as very tight adducters causing oain but generally moving about on 2 crutches pain free.  
The physio today confirmed that I'd had a ceramic head and an acetabular bone graft.  My understanding of bone grafts is that the patient is to be non weight bearibg for a period of time to allow the graft to take.  I was up the day after the op with no mention of rest.  I am not due to see my surgeon for another 6 weeks.  A bit worried!  Anybody else had similar?

"I had my THR in January and would like to share some of the highs and lows that I have experienced. The early weeks were not easy. Sleeping was difficult, the support stockings were horrible, the pain was worse than I had imagined and I was so dependent on my husband. By 6 weeks I could walk without a crutch, but often experienced discomfort in my groin, and often in the lower part of my leg. I found sitting very uncomfortable, but being able to lie on my side in bed really helped my recovery. I made sure that I did my exercises 3 times a day and tried to walk every day. It is now 12 weeks since my operation and I can say that I feel normal again. The discomfort when walking has gone, I can get my socks on, I walked for nearly an hour yesterday and I am sleeping better. The first weeks are hard, but I can say now that it is worth all the difficulties. I hope this post will help others who can't see light at the end of the tunnel.

"I know alot of us went into hip replacement expecting to come out with alot less pain, and have been rocked back on our heels at our experiences. I know that the grinding pain of bone against bone went straight away, but I was unprepared for the level of pain once I got home, especially on getting in and out of bed.
Nobody even hinted at how ""sleeping"" on your back could be a nightmare. My backpain in the morning was as bad as the hip pain.
Icing the scar wasn't't mentioned in the booklet I got, yet the knee replacements were sent home with Icing sleeves. I bought a gel pack from a well known
. It has been a godsend.
At 4 weeks tomorrow, I find I am turning a corner. I am beginning to sleep for more than 4 hours a night, still in 2 hour stretches, and grab a nap if I am tired after lunch.
What have I learnt? Not to compare myself to anyone else, pace myself, but push a bit. Keep a diary so I can spot improvement.
Feel guilty because when I got stuck behind people on crutches on the pavement I used to resent them holding me up! Now I feel frustrated that my walking is so slow!
Feel relieved that I can look forward to summer.

"I just wanted to share about my experience. 4 years ago I fell, I cracked my hip bone and it was missed on an xray and even though for almost a year I complained of pain I was told it was nothing and prescribe pain killers that made me gain a ton of weight. The following year the ball of my hip broke off and I had hip pinning surgery. Two weeks into healing it started to pull apart and I was told it was because again of my weight. 6 months went by no healing my surgeon admitted he may not have known what he was doing as that was his first hip pinning I was referred to a young hip revisionist, i then had a left leg introchantric valgus osteotomy.( basically the cut my thigh bone repositioned my leg bone to put pressure on the ball of my hip). 4 weeks after surgery I could tell something wasn't right and i was told to try to walk as much as I could to promote bone healing. A year had went by and no healing I was scheduled for a hip replacement and while I was waiting the bone died and the screw put into place was digging out my hip socket. Through all of this I could barely walk for 3 years. I have 4 children. I could not work.My husband and I had to relocate and lost our house because of all this. Being 28 and a having a broken hip has been the hardest thing of my life! Last year we moved and my new family Dr recommended a wonder surgeon who specializes in my issues I had I met with him and knew he really cared about my issues more then the last two surgerons ever did. Not once did he blame anything on my weight! I got in within a few months of waiting and tomorrow am 10 weeks post op. I didn't get to walk for almost 8 weeks so only have been walking 2 weeks. I ditched all walking aids after 3 or 4 days. I have never felt better i thought I would be on crutches/cane for months but I am doing great. I walk 10,000 steps or more everyday! I have little to no pain..mostly in my ankle because my calf is so week to hold up my tendon but that's due to not walking for so long. Because of a hip replacement I got my life back and I am so grateful for that! Just wanted to share my story that even though sometimes the end never seems near good does come out of a hip replacement. It was the best thing that has ever happened to me!

"Saw my OS this afternoon and I'm all signed off and don't see him for a year!
All is good - no more restrictions so I'm really excited about having a bath, getting my pants on without a grabber, sleeping on my stomach!
He told me that next year I can ski, surf and waterski - just wants to give it a year to ""bed in"".
He also told me I can swim now, including breaststroke. He said it may be uncomfortable at first but the hip is really stable. Also Pilates fine as long as I tell them I've had a THR.
The ache in my femur apparently very normal in an uncemented hip and it's just the bone forming around the stem. He told me to use it as a guide and stop walking when it hurts and that over time it will get better.
Also the nerve damage (numbness) in my right (non-op) side will go over time. But that it will take months. He has very few cases of this but I am slim and he told me that it's the combination of that with the position you need to be in for the operation.
So all good. Ploughing on with the physio to build up strength and will have 8 more weekly sessions.
Am so happy to have had this operation. It has given me back my life and I hadn't realised how bad it had been until I had this done.
Today is also my first day of no meds at all.
Glass of wine tonight I think!!
Just wanted to share with anyone who is nervous as I was terrified of having this done and it has been a miraculous surgery for me.
Thanks for all the support. It has helped me so much!

I asked why I still limped and he said sometimes this is permananet. On my way out he called me back and asked why I was using my right hand for the cane? I said well it was my right hip that was replaced. No No he said I should be using the opposite hand to the replaced hip and maybe that's why I limp badly. No one told me this??? Since changing hands I am walking better and the limp not so noticeable so hopefully by the time I go back in 3 months I will be limp free??

During my replacement (lateral), they had problems popping the ball out and I ended up with nerve damage. It was bad enough I had no use of my quad after the surgery (as well as one of my hip muscles) for more than three months post. Everything finally started working again and I have a lot more feeling in the leg (numb from ankle to above knee). The problem is with the feeling returning, I have constant pain in the top half of my thigh (front). For a while I thought it might be bone pain from the prothesis but I am becoming more convinced it is pain from the quadricep.
Has anyone else experienced nerve damage that as it was healing (and it is healing) there was pain from it?

"Hi guys,
It's day 9 for me post surgery, and I thought I'd check in and also ask for some tips, if I may?
Pain ranges from a 4 or 5 to an 8/10, depending on what time of day it is. I'm keeping up (mostly) with the PT, but my main issue is sleeping... Or should I say, lack thereof.
I've see a couple of posts about angling pillows under knees, ankles... But has anyone got any other ideas? I've currently got my ankle and foot elevated on a hard pillow and a doubled up pillow under my knee. I find this helpful but only as an alternative position, rather than pain reducing or sleep assisting.
My knee and thigh area are still incredibly tight and sore and I believe that the majority of my pain is there, rather than the actual replacement. Who would have thought?!
Any thoughts, suggestions, opinions appreciated as always.
Hope everyone is well!! Thanks in advance!

"Mine best aids have to be my grabber and my crutch pod.
The pod is a plastice recepticle that fits on to your crutch or stick with little prongs on that fit into the holes in your stick to stop it running down the stick.
It is ideal for carrying bottled drinks, telephone, wrapped sandwiches, bits of rubbish for the bin empty cups and of course a few treats.
It has been invaluable and well worth the few pounds it cost. I found it on the internet.
Nurses and PT at the hospital had not seen one before but would be recommending them to other patients.
Would be interested to see if anyone else has an aid that has been worth the caost.

"I'm now 7 weeks post non-cemented left THR, a 49 year old woman. A week ago I walked for about a km, then did a little standing dancing to the Time Warp (it was Richard O'Brien's 70th b day if you know the Rocky Horror show). I digress... The next day I noticed my upper left thigh was a bit hot and swollen, stiffish and a bit sore. Every now and then when I went from non-wieght bearing to weight bearing on my left (operated) leg I felt/heard an dull click. Sunday I threw up and runny number twos and got a bit paranoid there might be an infection. By the Monday the swelling was still there so I went to my Dr and blood tests ruled out infection, throid and menopause. When I walk my upper left thigh kind of wobble like a bowl of jelly. This is new since the Friday night. I saw a physio on Tuesday and she thinks most likely a ligament moving from the swelling.

"Hello Fellow Hippies!

I did have a few questions for him.  The first for him to confirm the type of approach (Anterior or Posterior?) he used on me.  I felt sure that he was going to say Posterior because my scar in on the side of my hip.  He informed me that he used a safer approach called the Anteriolateral Approach.   This newer approach is more commonly used today.  When I got back home, I decided to look it up.  This is what I've found:
A minimally-invasive procedure, anterolateral total hip replacement is performed through a small incision on the anterior, or side, of the hip. Because muscles and tendons are not disturbed, the prosthetic joint is more likely to remain in place during the recovery process. Patients who have had anterolateral hip replacement do not have the same movement restrictions as those who have had a posterior total hip replacement. This procedure typically results in less pain, quicker recovery and faster return to everyday activities.
I told him that every once in a while I still get pain in my femur.  He said that this should completely go away by 12 months.
I asked him if I'd ever be as flexible as I was prior to the surgery.  He said I can expect anywhere from 95 - 100%.  It's just a matter of letting the body heal over the first 3 months, then slowly stretching those muscles back out. 
I also asked him about eventually having to have a replacement in 15-20 years time.  His response was, you new hip will likely last between 25-30 years.  He used a brand made by the company 'Stryker'.  They are made so that the part that goes into the leg should not have to be removed at all, as the top part is detachable.  He said I will only need to have the ceramic ball replaced which is a simple procedure.

"So I ended up going to the emergency room last week with severe pain in my groin area, I'm 29 years old and was in a serious car accident November of last year. I knew for a fact I was going to need a THR somewhere in the future as my orthepedic surgeon had told me. I didn't think it was going to be this soon.
So due to a infection I acquired from the surgical wound I received last year in my hip, they were able to salvage my hip, now when I went back to the emerfency room last week the infection had deformed my femoral head, so they went ahead and performed a debridgement (cleaned the infected area out in surgery) and removed screw they had implanted in my hip from the fracture I initially received in the car accident.
Now I currently have a hip spacer, which I believe is temporary, until my infection is gone. Will I be able to walk without a cane with my hip spacer I know its basically made out of cement, and not titanium like the final THR, what can I expect till I get the final THR? I know it can only get better with the final THR any tips to get around mobility with the hip spacer?

ALL front pain. I'm on morphine patches, taking iboprufen and paracetamol and sitting here with a hot water bottle on my lower back. My GP now thinks it's more spine related and I'm due a consultation with a specialist next Friday.
Please could you have a look at my MRI results from 2015 and tell me if you think whatever was going on then could now be worse and be contributing to my terrible terrible pains? I'm now unable to walk AT ALL. My pain is equal in both legs. I have had huge problems with lower back pains  - like labour pains - for 10 years. My thigh pains started three yesrs ago whilst walking. It was only in one thigh at the time but they were so sharp they used to stop me in my tracks. Then the groin pains started, same side. I was limping every single day and when the pains started in my right thigh I assumed it was because I had been transferring all my weight onto tjhat leg when walking. If I walked on the very OUTSIDE of my bad leg I could feel less pain. Then both thighs started to pain just the same and sometimes in my knees. Last night I lay in bed and could feel pain in a foot!! My GP feels I need another MRI but I just need to know if you feel the MRI i've attached could be worse now 18 months later....Also the 2nd attachment must have been in about 2014.

"Good afternoon everyone,
I recently had a Left Hip Resurfacing op (nearly 4 weeks ago).
Was at physio today and discussed my left knee pain (outer knee) and after undergoing some exercises my physio casually mentioned I still have referred pain from my hip to my knee. 
You can imagine my head is thinking 'surely it's not failed already'.
Essentially is this a common problem after hip surgery? I have upped my physio in the last week and more than halved my medication so possibily I am just feeling it more but I do have some bruising (it's been here for about a week but it's beginning to fade).
Just wondered if I am panicking over nothing and this is simply all part of  he healing/adjustment process.
What everyone's experience around this?

"To All Hippies,
Do you remember how terrified you were when you first found out that you'd need a Full Hip Replacement (FHR)?  This is such a common procedure now and high success rates, but this doesn't always calm our fears prior to the surgery. 
Why don't we hippies reach out to posible newbies who are contemplating a FHR and tell them what we experienced by listing  5 POSITIVE THINGS about getting our FHR.  I'll go first:
1.  The surgery seemed quicker and easier than I'd expected and I went home the second day.
2.  The pain level was very managable with meds, ice packs and rest.
3.  I only needed walking aids (walker/crutches/cane) for the first 8-10 days. 
4.  Physical Therapy wasn't too bad at all.  In fact after 8-10 weeks I could comfortably get around and others couldn't believe that I'd ever had the surgery.

I am driving short distances and can do a small supermarket shop but find it all pretty tiring by the time I've finished. Still need to rest a lot.
I had hoped I would be more energetic at this stage and able to walk a bit further. Not sure if I should just keep increasing the distances gradually or go slower. I find I am so bored at home! I am longing to walk my dog again but as he's a 1 year old lab who needs a fair bit of exercise it feels like a way off yet.
Anyway just wondered if this is all normal at this stage? I know I had soft tissue damage when I slipped on the stairs at 2 weeks which may account for the aches after walking but was hoping that would have healed by now!
Sorry a bit of a moan, just want to run before I walk I guess.
Thanks for listening!

"Today its exactly 12 weeks since my THR and I feel great. Went for a pedicure to celebrate. I'm walking lots, still doing exercises both on the bed and standing, I'm driving my manual car and went back to work part time last week, everything is almost back to normal although my operated leg doesn't yet have the same mobility as my other leg. I still use 1 stick when I'm out walking. More for confidence as I could probably do without it and I'm almost off the codeine. I'm hoping to get back on my horse in a couple of weeks time.
Are there any precautions I should still be aware of? Because I'm pain free the majority of time I tend to forget my new hip but I don't want to go any damage as things have gone so well.
Any advice please now I've got to the 12 weeks milestone.

I am worried I am going to have more problems than solutions after my lateral hip surgery cheduled for April 12  and hear the anterior procedure is superior for healing. The operating surgeon is not warm or fuzzy or guaranteeing anything and talked abut all the down sides inclulding the possibility of disparate leg lengths. I am terrified of having my leg sawn in half but literally canno walk anywhere at this point. I am 61 and also concerned thta this procedure will not be long lasting enough to take me to the end of my life...

"i hope I'm panicking about nothing, but I have rally really hard swelling around my new hip area, and I'm panicking that the hip has extended further out on the new hip than the good (non operated) hip. I've been in quite a lot of pain since physio 2 days ago, so that's not helping my worries, but in the mirror the operated hip looks 2 inches wider than the other. Is this normal? I'm panicked that I'll have two different widths of hip forever. Hopefully it's just the swelling which is just really, really hard, but I thought swelling was softer than that? 
If anyone can help my fears that would be great. Are the hips supposed to still be symmetrical after surgery? 
Thank you. I am going to see my surgeon tomorrow to check with him, but I am just so panicked. It doesn't feel agonising enough to be dislocated, but I am hyper mobile so I just don't know.

"I'm 15 weeks out from bilateral THR anterior approach. For the most part, my recovery has been great. I'm only 45 and was otherwise in great health prior to surgery. No walker or even cane after about 1 week. Back to work (from home at first) at 2 and a half weeks. Released from physical therapy and driving after 4 weeks. Currently up to walking 10,000 steps at day.
But two issues still. One is that my range of motion is still limited and doesn't seem to be getting better at this point. I do exercises and stretching, but not sure if I should be pushing even more yet. For example, I'd like to get back to occasional motor cycle riding with my husband, but I couldn't possibly sit/straddle seat behind him now. I can put my socks and shoes on, but still not comfortably/easy as I used to even 6 months to a year before surgery (before things started getting really bad and steroid injections stopped helping). I've been told I also have SI joint arthritis, and at 6 weeks check up, my surgeon said I could still expect to get better, but possibly never the range of motion I had before. This is a bit depressing given my age. Plus, I've already had to give up running, which I loved. What are others' experiences getting better range of motion from this point (15 weeks) out?
Also, although I've been of anything stronger for a long time, I still need to take ibuprofen regularly. It's rare for me to be able to go a day without it. The pain is in my right hip (which strangely enough was my better hip before surgery), right knee (please don't be another joint failing me), and sometimes my lower back. Can I expect pain to get better from this point, or am I destined to keep taking ibuprofen? I hate having to regularly take meds like this.
Thank you all! This forum has been a lifesaver even though I don't post much.

My right foot has full range o motion, left foot can't bend foot towards me but I can push down, I've also been told my complication is similar to diabetic nerve damage, I don't know coz I am not diabetic.  Life has been pretty much like that for 16+ years, since my nerve problem limits my runnin or dancin I no longer do them, real simple.  I've been told my hip should last me 15 yrs., that's nice. I'm just wondering, how will my hip fail, or what signs should I be aware of, yes I will ask my primary care phys., just wondering what we lay ppl think.  I don't expect anything crazy like the knob part will crack off and I'll just fall and have a loose leg dangling.  Anybody want to comment, specially ppl with longer post op times or just plain smart physician types. 16yrs. and it feels the same as about 3 months post op, just no runnin or dancin.

"Attended a group physio session and sat next to a lady who was 5 weeks post op. She was telling me her hip had dislocated 3 times.
15 minutes in to the session it happened again as she lent forward to move her bag. The other times she had been pulling the backs of her shoes up and picking her bag up from the floor.
A warning to us all to remember the rule. For what ever reason it seems this lady was unable to dispite the obvious pain she was in when the medics tried to move her.
Next time I forget I've had a THR I will remember this.

"I see my surgeon on March 7th to likely set up for right hip replacement surgery in late March. Has anyone had second thoughts/doubt as the surgery date nears? Several thoughts are going through my head. I have been told the right hip has severe arthritis and needs to be replaced and to wait as long as possible if pain manageable. However, I have struggled with pain at night. I have some success using ibupropen, tylenol and a muscle relaxant...but still get some pain at night. So my primary care doctor thinks I should go ahead with the surgery based on quality of life issue. He said most people are glad they did the surgery. My second thoughts are will this really be successful and eliminate the pain? how long out of work and will the new hip be somehow disabling? maybe I can hang in there a few more years with the pain meds? Despite all the second thoughts I am leaning towards the surgery as I know two co-workers that are glad they did it. Anyone go through this and what made you finally take the leap to surgery?

"I had a LTHR just over 6 months ago and it couldn't have worked out better. I have better function than I ever have had in my life and no pain.
My implant is ceramic on ceramic, short stem and cementless. I have been told it should last a long time and that even though I am in my 40s I am unlikely to wear it out.
Here's my question. Suppose I do wear it out and in 15 to 20 years I need revision surgery, how bad is this? Will it just mean the same process over again. An operation followed by 3 weeks of hell, another 4 of discomfort, then back to normal?
I am not sure how much I should fear revision surgery and therefore to what extent I should be limiting the use of my new joint.

"I had LTHR uncemented almost 6 weeks ago. The last 2 weeks i progressed from a walker to a cane and the past few days i have been walking a kilometre at local park with the cane. The path is undulating in a couple of places so not competent flat. However i have developed bad lower back pain which radiates down to my knee and ankle. Before i had the hip replacement the leg was shorter than the other but had now been evened up. Also already have severe degeneration in a disc in lower back and hypermobility in ankles which already causes ankle pain even with specially made orthotics. However the pain i am experiencing now i think is all coming from my lower back. Has anyone else experienced this and if so how did you resolve it. Have no benchmark re exercise and walking distance as don't see surgeon for first checkup until 6 week mark next week. Am thinking i need physio once restrictions are all lifted.

"Hello All ,
Im here in Australia and after suffering from increasing pain Ive been reading alot of your comments.
I have had a total of 3 arthroscopies over a 2 year period ,which didnt help resulting in a THP 4 months ago. Ive had a relatively slow recovery but felt I was sarting to progress quite well .No walking aids unless its been a very long day of waliking and I begin to limp more. Ive been walking daily at a gentle pace on my treadmill .Im stiff to begin with but it seems to help as I get going .Both my doctor and physio seem to think its ok to continue with that as Im not in any pain when doing so. I  was also doing pyhsio and hydrotherapy until about 4 weeks ago when he pain at night began to increase .Im now having intense massage by my pyhsiotherapist once a week .But if anything I feel the pain is becoming worse every night ! Im becoming increasingly frustrated as I thought the THP would be the holy grail .I was told that it would end my pain . Im mostly good all day but awake every night from 1.30 - 2 am with a nagging deep throbbing pain on my hip /thigh area which radiates down to my knee.At times its a sudden intense sharp pain that comes in waves taking my breath away ,then it settles or resumes to the more constant dull aching .
Can anyone out ther associatte with this and help shed some light on what could be causing it ? My physiotherapist has been really good but is still working through possible reasons himself . I apparanlty have quite alot of scar tissue in the operation area also . 
The sleep deprevation along with the pain is so overwhelming ,I hope anyone can help me with their advice or if they have suffered the same issues .

"In responding to Kaura's question about what to expect when going through a total hip replacement, I found many interesting and inspirational insights among member posts. Reply's to my responses included a suggestion to begin a new discussion. It痴 now Wednesday, March 15, nine days after my surgery, and I'll start this discussion by including updates to my early (Day 4 and 5) posts, as well as a further update through today.
Of course, there's no one outcome  everybody's experience will be different.  But I found that understanding what other people did that contributed to their experience was helpful. I壇 invite people to ask questions and comment on things that may have contributed to their experience with total hip replacement
Day 4 Post - I had a left hip replacement 4 days ago on Monday March 6th.  I'm a 60 year old male in decent condition. 5 10, 170 pounds.  In beginning of February, I was diagnosed with torn hip-joint labrum and hip socket cartilage, arthritis and bone spurs, and total hip replacement was recommended (vs. arthroscopic hip surgery).   The surgeon recommended a ceramic ball and a polyethylene socket.  He went in through the front of the hip (anterior).  He said that anterior was less invasive and had a quicker recovery time vs going in through the side of the hip.
I was walking with crutches about 5 hours after the surgery and was cleared for discharge the same day.  I elected to stay overnight to be safe.  The next morning (Day 2) I went home and was fortunate to be able to walk without assistance, although I am using a cane to make sure I can focus on my impaired gait.  
On Day 3, I was in a lot more pain and began to experience more swelling.  Today (Day 4), I'm feeling much better and getting to spend a lot more time walking. I'm on two painkillers -- I'm now cutting back on both, and using the stronger of the two at night only.  So far so good.  
Day 5 Post - I tried going the day without painkillers and up'd the amount of time walking per hour and the quantity/intensity of exercises (leg lifts, foot pumps, etc). By late yesterday afternoon I concluded that I went too far too fast.  I began to experience a high level of stiffness and pain in my operated leg and found it more and more difficult to get up each time after sitting for more than 10 - 15 mins. [On the positive side, my painkiller ""boycott"" resulted in a muh-appreciated improvement in my constipation issues.]  
After an early dinner yesterday, I took 2 of the strong painkillers (5mg oxycodone) plus a prescription sleep aid and went to bed around 6:30 pm.  Woke up around midnight in pain and took 2 more pain killers and another sleep aid, which got me through til 5am this morning.  I got up feelling well rested.
I think I'm going to go back to taking the painkillers more along the lines that they were prescribed to see if that helps in facilitating the more aggressive daily ""workout"" routine.  For now, I'll still reserve the strong painkillers for overnight (2 oxy's every 4 - 5 hours or so) and the milder ones for during the day (1 - 2  50mg tramadols every 6 hours).
So far today, I feel like my progress is back to where I was around Day 2. Hoping that by the end of the day, I'll feel more like I've had 6 days of progress.  
Day 8 Update - Now beginning to feel that some breakthrough improvements are happening in the operated leg.  Beginning to consciously share walking load among both legs, giving the good leg a bit of a break. Now walking without assistance, but staying inside (wintry/icy outside last few days), practicing 菟erfecting posture, sticking to routine for doing daily exercises.
Factors contributing to recovery so far include: 
ｷ       Urgency  In 6 weeks, by April 17th, I want to be able to get back to the gym for full workouts and to be ready for spring outdoor cleanup
ｷ       Time available - being semi-retired helps immensely.  Making your recovery your full-time job is priceless.
ｷ       Medications  sticking to the prescribed medication routine, with a change in one of the painkillers due to a rash that developed.
ｷ       Self therapies, including elevating leg like 30 mins each hour, and icing it several times a day
ｷ      Daily exercise routine, that includes walking unassisted while practicing 菟erfect posture and a corrected walking gait (about 10  15 minute about 5 times a day) and doing 2 - 3 sets of 7 doctor-recommended exercises per day:a)   Ankle pump - 10 reps, both directions, both ankles, occasionally hold for 5 seconds
b)   Quad press - 10 reps, press quad down, hold each Press for 5 seconds
c)   Glue squeeze - 10 reps, squeeze butt cheeks, hold 5 secs
d)   Heal slide - 10 reps, slide heel up toward butt, try to push knee bend
e)   Sort leg lift (calf lift) - 10 reps x :05 sec hold (pillow under thigh - raise lower half of leg)
f)    Sitting knee lift - 10 reps x :05 sec hold 
g)   Assisted straight leg lift - 10 reps 
Day 9 Update - Today, I felt very good.  More like myself, and getting my sense of humor back.  Getting around well with very manageable level of pain.  On the downside, I feel like I went too far too fast again by not paying attention to my swelling.  Went out for the first time since the surgery for lunch and spent way too much time with my leg not elevated.  I知 now dealing with a throbbing left leg and foot.  Hopefully icing my leg and keeping it raised overnight will help.
More to come....

It is always warm to touch,no signs of redness or infection, it just won't go away. I did have some little lumps and bumps,they have all gone. I have been massaging it daily, with a little firm pressure but makes no difference. The scar is perfectly fine, not sure if I should contact the gp?

I delivered my twins by Caesarean section with an epidural and didn't cope very well with that.

"Hi all
Well l have been a member of this forum for nearly 2 years. I first joined when l found out l had. Ostioarthritis in both hips. I had no idea l was 42 at the time and it started with a pain in my left groin. I worked full time and was fairly active. I suffered the pain for almost a year visiting gp twice to be told its most likely a pulled muscle and given painkillers nope it never went away agai visit to gp as it was getting harder to move about and get dressed. Again another gp told me its a pulled tendon few months later l was in tears just trying to get my jeans on and l though no more. Went back and demanded they do xrays. A week later l was told l needed both hips replaced due to OA. Got first 1 done in dec 2015 and yes it was hard but l mamaged 4 to 6 weeks later l was great walking with no sticks driving again l was desperate to get other side done just so all the OA pain was gone. I had my 2nd in feb 2016 again an even easier recovery it seemed much easier tgan 1st and though brilliant that is me fixed. But not so long after it my left knee started getting really bad pain. At first l though it must be coming from my hip replacement but it got worse so l went back to see my surgeon who did more xrays and found out l had it in both knee's to. By this time OA took over my life l just seemed to be in constant pain. I had to go part time at work and my concentration levels were gone as all l could focus on was pain. I could not sleep in my bed a full night l was up and down and the couch became comfier for me to sleep. I had my lert knee replaced in august. This op was so much harder than my hips and much more painful. My surgeon did warn me that the knee replacement was not as good as hip and that l would always feel l had a metal knee. So true. I decided then l needed a break from surgery as l went through so much. Days of depression pain sleepless nights. I went back to work after being of a year and though l will suffer the other knee for as long as l can. I just needed some normalitly back and l finally started getting my confidence back when l got it in my left ankle and this time l could not suffer it. I can hardly walk the oain is awful l can't put much weight on it. I was at the doctors today and told l needed my ankle fused asap as l had it severe and the pain would get to much for me. Which it already has. I have an appointment to see the surgeon next week with hope to get the op done soon. Bearing in mind l still need my right knee done.
Where does it end? Thats nearly every joint in my lower half that has OA. I am so tired of being in pain and relying on painkillers to be able to move. I would say l am parcially disabled in my lower half now as l can't walk more than 20m. My life has been turned upsidedown. I can't do normal things l used to or go holidays. I spend a lot of time sleeping and when its my 3 working days it kills me now l can barely make it through a day and cone home and sleep. Somedays l am in so much pain at work l become withdrawen and hardky speak. I know l will be in surgery again in the next month for my ankle. Thankfully l am lucky enough to have private medical insurance as a benifit from work or god knows how long l would be waiting for.
But what l will say to everyone getting hip replacements go for it. They are the best things l have had done. I can't even feel that they have been done now and l would get a hip replacement in a minute instead of a knee or the ankle which l have not yet had done but have read about it.
I just wonder when it will end for me as it seems never just now. OA is my life now and its hard to live with and my husband must be so fed up at how much our life has changed. I know l am so he must be as he basicallly has to do everything for me.
Anyway thats my story so far.
When does this end......

Thank you so much, its all happened so quickly and I'm pretty overwhelmed, and male surgeons have no idea what it's like to be a single mum with an absent ex husband (he lives and works oversees so he can't help out).
thank you all so much.

"I'm 29 years old, I was in a serious car accident which requires me now to have a total hip replacement which doctors have left it up to me to decide when I'm ready, at this current moment the pain is dibilatating I can bearly walk corectly without pain on my right hip I can't even lift my leg into the bathtub without serious pain, what can I expect with the THR, will my ability to move around be better without serious pain? I know usually the demographics for this surgery are people in there 60's 70's, I'm just scared out of my mind, I know for a fact I will need a revision of the hip in another 10-15 years from wear. I go this Monday to the Othopedic surgeons office to discuss the severe and dibilatating pain I have.

"We have just been told, months after being referred with severe pain, the my daughters hip replacement has failed. She had it done 18 months ago, she is an unusual case as she was only 16 when she had it done. She has other medical problems caused by her receiving a brain injury at birth which caused her to suffer with hip dysplasia. She has had countless surgeries on her hip and pelvis just to get her through until she could have the replacement. She really believed, as her consultant had told her that the hip replacement would make her life so much easier and would be her last surgery for years. Feel so sad for her and just don't know what to do. We're waiting to hear from the hospital as they need to rule out infection by doing a hip aspiration but the consultant is 99% sure there's not infection and the replacements failed because of her weak thin bones. Her case is going to be discussed at the regional hip meeting to decide the way forward but the consultant is very unsure if anything will work and even talked about maybe removing and having no workable joint.
She's in so much pain and understandably very upset, as we all are.
Sorry for such a negative post but just wondering if anyone had an experiences similar. Thanks Vicki

"Hi there, I hope this is the right section for posting this.
Im posting on behalf of my Nan (who is blind and has late stage dementia she is 96)  3 weeks ago she was taken into hospital with a broken hip they had to replace the ball as the break was older than 5 days, she was in pain the very next day but it took the hospital a week to work out it had popped out (she was starving herself and not drinking because of the pain) they manipulated it back in and everything was good but it has come out again and they can't put it back in now they are saying there is nothing they can do and she will just have to take pain relief. It is coming out while she is in bed she hasn't even tried walking or getting out of bed (she was perfectly mobile before she went into hospital)
Is there really nothing that can be done we are scared that if she is in pain she will just starve herself to death, she has stopped eating and drinking again now.

Happy to say it's done (about 9 hours or less ago now), I'm in recovery and can't sleep at all. Pain is pretty bad despite the infrequent morphine. I'm guessing this is par for course, but obviously knowing that sleep would aid recovery...
Anyhow, here we go, I suppose. I've got some meditation recordings to help me relax, so fingers crossed (since I can't cross anything else?!)

"I had an uncemented total hip replacement 20 years ago that failed today. I had just potted up some seedlings and was bending down to clear up stuff when my hip gave way. It made a sound like there were granules crunching around in my hip joint combined with a lot of pain such that I could not stand up.
I dragged myself indoors and tried to relax and try to stand up but just could not weight bear. I called the emergency services as this was a Saturday and my surgery was closed.
Ambulance to hospital and after several hours was seen by a doctor who ordered X-rays. Orthopediac consultant brought in and he thought that the plastic between the two metal elements had partially failed. Sent home as they could do nothing until they knew the name etc of the prosthesis used and had considered a plan of action.
By this time the pain had eased and I. Was asked to try weight bearing then walking which went quite well so was discharged and so I had to order a taxi for the ten mile journey.
I live on my own but felt that I should give it a go. Almost as soon as I got though the door by hip became quite stiff and was making a horrible loud squeaking noise!
I wonder if anyone else had this happen. I understand this squeaking is often found in the more modern ceramic hip joints but mine is the older metal and plastic type.

"I'm now 9 weeks post op and had my first shower today. It was wonderful.
I was told that I could have one at 4 weeks after my wound had healed if I had a walk in shower. Mines over the bath and because I live in my own I've been scared of slipping. So I plucked up courage today.
I had my settee, toilet and bed raisers taken back yesterday. So now I'm beginning to get back to normal and it feels great.
I go back to work on Monday on a phased return.
I still use 1 stick for confidence and am still doing all my physio exercises and massaging my scar as I still haven't got the full mobility in the joint yet. I know it will come with time.
I'm gradually reducing my pain meds. Almost off the codeine, only 3 a day now. I was on 8.
My last milestone will be to get back on my horse at 12 weeks post op.
So to those of you still in the very early stages of THR it is hard but it gets better and its wonderful to be pain free and so worth it in the end.

I have been having some severe pain across my lower back and down my buttock at times pain has been so debilitating I've been in bed most of the time. It started a few days before my 2 week post op appointment. I feel my surgeon blew me off by giving me more pain pills and telling me that time will make it better. After going to my PCP he scheduled a MRI and told me it could be sciatica so he pave me a medpack of steroids and I have to say I am not even a full day in with the first dose and I am already feeling so much better!

"Morning fellow hippies!
Just had some questions re my scar. I am three weeks out from TLHR posterior. I have a 5"" scar with internal dissolvable stitches. At my two week check up last week the OS said all looked good and said I don't need dressing on any more.
I am finding that it rubs my clothes and pulls. It seems to separate a tiny bit at the top but no leaking or bleeding. It is sore to touch but not hot and inflamed.
I have resorted to putting a lint and micropore dressing in in the day under clothes. Will this stop it healing?
The physio told me to rub it hard each day which I have been doing to desensitise the scar.
Is this all normal? How long does it usually take to stop hurting?! I am loathe to start rubbing any creams in it until it is completely sealed. Parts of it are but not all of it.
Otherwise all going well and walking well in house with no crutch and out and avout with one. Very stiff and a bit sore morning first thing and evening but no pain in the day (apart from scar rubbing!!)
Any info would be great.
Thank you!!

"Hi. I'm 12 weeks post LTHR. I don't know if this is normal or not but I seem to be taking 2 steps forward and one step back with my recovery. I do all my exercises but only manage to walk for about 10 minutes without being inj pain. I still use one stick for longer walks but I manage ok around the house and short distances.  When I'm sitting it feels like I'm sitting on a golf ball. My thigh to the back of my leg aches a lot and after a while it moves to the front and usually spreads down to my knee. My sick note runs out in 3 weeks and due to doing a very manual job as a care assistant with the elderly my Gp said my sick leave may have to extended further. Do you think I should ask for a referral to see a Physio? I just thought my recovery would have been quicker as I'm a slim, fit 60 year old. Sorry if I seem to be moaning.

"Hi, Iｴm Peruvian, 40, have been diagnosed with hip arthrosis when 22. Since then Iｴve known at some poing I would have to have a replacement done. nowadays I walk with help of a cane (not everyday), cant tie my own shoe laces, hardly can cuy my nails and have no day pain free. I can still walk a lot, work, ride bycicle (which I love as it allows me to get long distances with no pain), but my day to day is very limited by pain. Iｴm an artist, teacher and environmental / social activist so Im constantly standing up and moving around. Love traveling and have two lovely dogs to walk everyday. Iｴm not a sports person, have never been, though I know it would help. Dont smoke, dont do drugs, have a relatively healthy life,...with a not so heatlhy hip.
seems that time for surgery is near and Iｴm very scared. Iｴve never been sedated before, never had a serious surgery (one when I was 2 but of course donｴt remember at all), I live on my own and have no close relatives to lean on. so that is making me feel not only scared but kind of lonely too.
So... would love to hear some stories, experiences that can help me take a decition, in my country there are no real ""support"" groups so I found this one online, guess I might be in the right place.

"Hi - just an update of week two since my left THR which hopefully may be of value to anyone who has just had their THR and wondering what comes next.
 It has been quite an uneventful week really - certainly compared to last week. I have been reallly suprised at how much progress I have made. I increased my daily walk steadily through the week and can now manage 1.25 miles quite comfortably and have dropped down to one crutch as the second crutch doesnt seem to do much. It does take about 40 minutes though so not breaking any records.
   On Wednesday the Physio took a quick look at me and said I could be discharged. I am a bit miffed at this as I know that I am a long way from full fitness and a new set of exercises each week surely must be good ?
  On Friday I had my staples removed which was quick and painless and the scar is nice and neat ( according to my lovely wife). I now have a four week wait for my follow up with the consultant and I am sure that I can just expect a much more steady recovery between now and then.
 My goal is to just keep things ticking over - in my mind I have a broken bone in my leg and it will be six weeks to achieve full strength.
   I would be grateful if anybody has recieved advice on how soon they were allowed to go to the swimming pool please, I would love to go for a swim.

"One week post-op left THR  first of all I need to thank my consultant Mr Phillip Roberts and his team who have been faultless. I write this hopefully to reassure any people about to go in for their surgery and I am more than happy to answer any questions at all.
Day zero (Friday)  The consultant and the anaesthetist came to see me at about 9am to discuss things. I was first on the list due to my misshapen femur and pelvis making a more complicated procedure than usual. We agreed on spinal with a cannula in my wrist to administer sedative (diamorphine) as required. At 11am we met again in theatre and 10 minutes later was in a lovely relaxed sleep. 90 minutes later still I awoke in recovery still very happy and comfortable and was transferred to my bed. As I had no pain at all I declined oxycodeine  and just had paracetamol and nefopam coupled with an intravenous antibiotic and fragmin injected into my tummy to keep the clots away (injection every day for 28 days ). My blood pressure was 90/55 so it was decided that I shouldn稚 try getting out of bed today. After going to the loo  normally after the op my bladder changed its mind and went into retention so I had to have a catheter fitted. Also two drains, hydraulic DVT socks, oxygen pipes, cannula. Wound site about 175mm long with approx. 20 staples.
Day 1  (Saturday)  I awoke after a very comfortable night and still no pain  however at about 9am pain began to grow steadily and I asked for the oxycodeine and ibuprofen to be added. Mr Roberts popped in to see how I was at around 10am. At 11am the physio came and got me out of bed with the intention of taking me to x-ray. At the foot of the bed I became very nauseous and dizzy and nearly fainted which prompted the physio to get me back into bed sharpish. The pain continued through the day and proved difficult to get back under control ( probably varying between 5 to 8 out of 10) but by bedtime I was comfortable again. Bad news x-ray now shut till Monday. BP 100/65. Another shot of intravenous antibiotic.
Day 2  (Sunday)  I slept quite well even though on my back and enjoyed a good breakfast. The physio came at 9.30am with crutches but with having had a scare the day before he only walked me around the bed and back. I happily returned to have a nice day in bed. Until the consultant arrived at 4pm and put a bomb under me by telling me that the first days recovery post-op are his biggest indicator of the ultimate level of function of the new hip. He explained that all the muscles work, the joint is secure and will hold full body weight and the wound unlikely to open up. All I had to do was get up and walk. Following this I started getting in and out of bed at least every hour even through the night for very short walks ( tubes everywhere !  the nurses were lovely ) BP 100/65. Final shot of antibiotic, hydraulic socks and drips removed, still on oxygen to try to lift BP.
Day 3 (Monday)  Wow everything happened so quickly  more physio showing me the exercises to do at home, off to x-ray (amazing pictures ! ), more physio to do the stairs test, a visit from the anaesthetist and consultant Mr Roberts who walked with me 40m up and down a corridor and discussed the success of the operation and  I was discharged by mid afternoon. BP 110/65. I hadn稚 realised my last allowed dose of oxycodeine was Sunday night and so dropped to 30mg codeine instead. The weather was horrible on the way home and although only 5 miles home and following all the frenzied activity I was cold to the bone and in some pain ( level 4-5) Getting in and out of the car was quite easy though.
Day 4 (Tuesday)  -  Nice to be home. I managed the stairs quite well and pain was back under control. Steady progress today. A flat spot at around teatime ( 4-5pm) when I became very tired and pain up to around a 4-5. Off to bed not too bad really.
Day 5 (Wednesday)  -  Slept 2-3 hrs at a time with visit to the loo to keep legs moving each time I awoke  not too bad. Pillow beneath my knees and a firm foam pillow at the foot of the bed to rest my feet against. Spreads the weight quite nicely. Off to physio this morning at the health centre. He has added two more exercises  laying on my back
1.       Press back of knees firmly into the bed ( not great at this )
2.       Leg raise 200mm from the bed surface ( achieved zero mm )
Never mind stuff to work on. Back home  another flat spot around 4-5pm. First walk outside today probably about 50m there and back.
Day 6 (Thursday )  - Feeling good today. Almost all the swelling in my hip area has now gone and hardly any bruising left either. 500m walk along the street. Pain levels generally good. I have come so far in a week I am amazed. I have started to do stupid things like set off across the room without my crutches before remembering. My sports physio ( an old schoolmate ) messaged me today to warn me to take it easy for at least a few weeks as this is the time when problems can be encountered by trying to push too far too quickly. Point taken I am just doing the exercises set by the physio and a short walk each day. Leg raises are now achievable but still hard and also pushing foot out to the side and holding is quite hard  Lots to be working on but so far so good.
 So all in all a rollercoaster ride this week but feeling like I am moving in the right direction. Please don稚 hesitate to ask any questions as I got such a lot of great support from folk on this forum I am keen to help others also.

I am now six months post op. Last Tuesday, I took a heavy black rubbish bag to put into my wheelie bin. The bin is housed, at kerb level,upon a piece of my land. As I attempted to place the bag into the
Bin, it swivelled, threw me off balance which, in turn caused me to fall heavily into the road and onto my new hip. I have had X Rays which were checked by a radiologist, and I was told that all looked fine. Although , in pain, I have carried on as usual. I have just finished a pile of ironing. After putting the ironing board away, I can no longer put any weight through my leg. Whilst lying , I can bend it and also raise and take out to the side. But I can't weight bare.

"I've recently had the results of a hip X-ray & my doctor thinks the terrible groin and thigh pain I've been getting for months now is due to severe osteoarthritis of the hip. I think she mentioned bone spurs as well whatever they are. I asked if she thought I would need a new hip and she said yes.
Last week I saw another doctor - another matter - and he showed me the X-ray and pointed out how the space around one hip was narrower than the other. I was unable to do any of the leg raises he tried me with and said it was an orthopaedic appointment I needed. He mentioned that SOMETIMES a total hip replacement might not be necessary if keyhole surgery could clear some of the debris out of the affected joint. But obviously that would be a decision taken by the orthopaedic consultant.
In my (very limited) opinion the visible narrowed space I saw on the X-ray didn't look too bad but what is killing me is the pain in my groin and upper leg, Naproxin and paracetamol used to take a good edge off the pain but not anymore. I can hardly move with the groin pain and trying to turn over in bed is agony. Can anyone on here suggest what I could take to relieve this pain? It's now so bad I've had to buy a secondhand mobility scooter so I can at least get outside for a while. Thank you for any advice, it will be much appreciated!

I'm waiting for a thr - recently had the diagnosis of severe hip osteoarthritis - but surely this level of groin pain isn't normal to keep someone awake with it ALL night?? I needed to move in bed a little bit sometimes but the groin pain went over a 10 if I tried. I've never ever had such a painful night.
The groin pain is a bit easier now I'm sitting here at the computer but it's all round the top and side of my thigh as I'm sitting and also in my buttock.
I've never been kept awake by this level of pain and to be honest I'm scared stiff this morning. I'm trying to get an urgent doctor's appointment because of the level of pain I'm in. Can anyone tell me if they think it's ""normal"" to get more pain in the groin when lying down please?

"Hi there.
I had my left hip replacement on August 16th 2016 and I'm in way way worse pain now than before the surgery. I had my right one done in 2010 and it went perfect. They are both ceramic and done by the same surgeon in the same hospital. I truly would rather live with the pain I had before than the pain I have now. I have seen my surgeon a few times and he knows that I'm in agony. This past visit ( 2 weeks ago) he did a cortisone injection into the incision area and it has done nothing for the horrid nerve pain and spasms. I had a few complications in hospital and I fainted and I had blood pressure problems and they needed to do a blood transfusion so the last thing on earth I want is a hip revision or another replacement. I think that there is nerve damage and the pain is in the front of my thigh coming from the top and I have horrible spasms around the incision area into my butt cheek and down the back of the thigh. I was wondering if anyone else had had this and what did you do for it? He is treating it as an infection but as far as I know I have no other symptoms of infection.

"Hi , I'm waiting on a left THR.  To summarise I was born with hip dysplasia (dislocated hip) it was missed until I was three, then fixed  I think by an pelvic osteotomy.  I believe they took bone from my pelvis and grafted it onto the cup to make the joint stay in place though I'm not sure of the details.  Anyway all was fine until about 5/6 years ago then my joint went downhill rapidly, I,m bone on bone now, limp and can't walk far at all, I'm 49 .. 
My consultant said he will do the lateral approach..  I read of many having posterior approach and some a anterior but have not read much about the lateral approach.  
I know they cut through different muscles or less muscles in some cases with the anterior I'm just curious as to the difference .  He did say he favours this as there is less chance of dislocation but that's all he said and at the time I didn't think to ask more

"So after seeing the surgeon .. again ... this week I saw a sports massage man. He said my thigh muscles are in a mess .. his actual words were 'my god '! The sartorious muscle is like a piece of old leather . Did some very painful massage and hit all the painful spots. I am beginning to feel a bit p*ssed off with my surgeon as when I saw him Wednesday and said my muscles in the thigh are rock hard and an osteopath looked at it ( before the sports man) he muttered something about what do they know ) and DIDNT EVEN LOOK AT MY LEG himself ! No examination of muscles . Do orthopaedic surgeons KNOW about muscles ? His response was back to physio and possible pain management and see him in 3 months . So far spent ｣95 on private massage and am googling bad sartorious muscle ( the longest one in the body) and sending off for freeze creams . I can't afford all this I am only part time worker ! More massage booked and the sports masseur gave me exercises to do and diagnosed the issue in five seconds flat . Why aren't the surgeons bothered? Is it really a case of the metal is in ,X Ray looks good now off you toddle ?
I will demand an MRI scan next time and present them with the bill for massage as it seems I have to go down a private road to sort a problem that wasn't there before surgery !!!

"Hi fellow Hippies 
I was wondering if you have any suggestions on what is the best way to sit - not after surgery - but now until surgery. When on the computer I sit on an office chair with my feet a bit elevated. When watching TV I sit in a straight chair (Club-chair) with my feet up on an ottoman. I don't know what is best as I am in pain both ways.

"My dear forum friends 
 Thank you so much for your thoughts and prayers .
I am doing a  lot better today and am sure that this will continue 
My 殿ilment had nothing to do with the hip replacement surgeries  well, not directly anyway 
That is why I am a little hesitant to talk about it, but since you have been with me for so long, I will share some of it 
 I have said many times that this THR surgery was/is very confrontational for me  I relate to all of your emotions as I went through them myself 
This forum has been part of my life for almost 2 years 
My first THR surgery was March 19, 2015 (I can稚 believe it) and when 4 weeks post-op I found this forum  Of course I had issues and nobody to ask ..
The love and unconditional support I felt I will never forget 
I live alone but because of  I did not feel alone  many dark fearful nights I was up and reading the discussions -
 My 2nd THR surgery was September 10, 2015  Again, the forum was my place to go to every day until a couple of weeks ago.
I have been in sort of poor health for a while  flu and cold and just achy 
I probably picked up some bug in the senior citizen home where I do volunteer work and got violently ill (sorry for the drama) 
I thought I had food poisoning but instead contracted the Norovirus - I was sick for 2 weeks  Then got the flu 
 This all contributed to, what I call, the dark night of the soul  My hips are repaired  They were my focus for years and now I am done 
What will be my next step?
 I will figure it out, or not  It is okay and I know this will pass ..
 Thank you for reading and your concern -
I feel like a mother hen abandoning her chicks !!!
 Big warm hug
renee
 I am still on the forum and reading your posts

"Hi Everyone,
Advice please!
I was diagnosed with Polymyalgia rheumatica back in January 2016, the
pains in my legs and mobility didn't improve after being put on Prednisone (steroids ). It wasn't until October 2016 my Rheumatologist advised I
would need a double hip replacements due to the arthritis in my hips.
Xrays were taken in June and we're not too bad, after having 2nd x rays of my hips in December 16 with the surgeon I was shocked to discover how
much my hips had deteriorated. One ball joint is trying to escape the
socket and the other is following but not quite as bad! I can only walk with
Crutches but not very far and I am in constant pain when I walk. I am sure
the Prednisone has spurred the arthritis to where I am now. I am
decreasing my steroids slowly as advised by my Rheumatologist
( now on 2.5mg down from 30mg).
I have my first THR on 27th Feb 17 and I would like to ask you all that have had double replacements .....
1.How did the first operation effect the pain in the non operated leg.
2.Was there any over compensation ?
3.We're you able to cope with the pain in the non-op leg?
4. Any things I need to be aware of?
Thank you in advance for your replies

"I was placed on waiting list for my right hip replacement in October. I got a letter not long after saying latest I would be done wss 29th dec. Then I got a phone call advising couldnt achieve this and did I want to either wait for my consultant or be considered for another surgeon. I decided to wait as was told end March latest. Letter duly arrived confirming by 24th March latest. I didnt hear anything so gave them a ring to be told waiting list is now a year for new patients. Advised will now likely be september. I am shocked. If I had been told outset was a year, I would have chosen akternative of another surgeon in November. She says now transferring to another surgeons list will be same my own and I would be as well waiting.delay is due to shortage of beds. I understand that, but Im disappointed as pain and limited mobility is pretty bad, and of course I have made no plans last 5months which was pointless. Im 55 and lucky to work from home. I just wondered if anyone else waited 11months. In Scotland. So guess all authorities are different.

Now though D day is nigh and you'd think I'd be ecstatic and excited. However I can stop crying, I'm a mess at work, I feel I'm falling apart. Now, I'm not a cryer or a faller aparter so I'm at a loss.
I'm thinking of going to GP and asking for some medication to get me from here to there so to speak
I'm j9r especially worried about the op perse, I'm not really thinking about it. I suspect IT might be lurking around the old subconscious though. I just can stop crying. Other half keeps trying to ""fix"" things and boss at work completely unrealistic and hard faced about targets.... despite pretending to understand. ""Oh yes you can flex work but what about xyz""....
So sorry for the rant! I'm losing it at little things. Does anyone rexcomend any particular medication? Have tried medication based on mindfulness but I just cant find the head space.

"Total hip replacement in August 2016 went as anticipated. Physical therapy progressed well and I was on my way to regaining my activity level and enjoying the benefits of a successful surgery. Problems began at 5 week's post op with the incision opening, swelling, redness and drainage. Oral antibiotic and topical ointment were prescribed by the surgeon. However the next few months brought about intermittent fevers, night sweats, return of hip pain and overall pain. It took several months and several physicians to diagnose a staph aureus of the implanted hip. In December, I had a second surgery to replace several components followed by 6 weeks of IV antibiotics. I remain on oral antibiotics (with associated side effects!) and no end in sight. Worst of all, I have no reassurance from MD's that this will address the infection. I am moving well again yet feel overwhelming sadness and concern about my future health. Any guidance or suooort much appreciated!!

During my long wait I have kind of got my life together and the pain is manageable and im really wondering if its even worth bothering with the op at all. Even though my surgeon says I need it.
I'm also worried about how I'm going to tell my employer that I will have to be off sick for 3 months or more as I have only been in my job for 4 months and its quite a pysically demanding job.
Im also worried about not been able to do anything after the op and I dont have any family close by and the whole thing is just a nightmare really..

"Hi all! I posted I think a month ago or something about a painful hip. Surprise it has gotten worst - it has taken me a month to see my family doctor and then I had to reschedule due to icey weather - I see him on friday. It feels almost exactly like when my hip loosened except getting worst. 
First off - Due to many surgeries since being a baby I have a higher level of pain tolerence - I learned how to crawl/walk with my hip out of the socket. So I know when I start complaing something is up - I am at the point of using a bath chair in the tub because I just can't stand that long anymore - the pulling sensation in my groin area keeps me awake half the night (it seems to be worst at night). Need to sit down and take a breathier every ten minutes while doing dishes. And my fave if I sit/stand for too long I break out into a cold sweat and feel like I have gotten the worst case of the flu and get physically ill and shakes. After the some pain killers and lying down without moving at all for an hour or so it calms back down to managable. 
Anyway I was wondering if anyone knows if it is common for a replaced hip loosening if the previous one has? The main reason I haven't gone to the emerency room yet is because they would just make me sit in the waiting room for a few hours, take x-rays and give me something in needle form or in IV form for pain and send me home - a few hours that might just kill me. And the fact that the hospital in my town even though it does do hip replacements has already told me that mine is too diffcult for them so I will have to go to Toronto eventually

"Hi Everyone
 In a few days ( 1st replacement 24/2/17) I will be worrying about how to make my new hip last as long as possible rather than worrying about the operation itself. 
  What I want to know is do THR's generally fail at the connection between stem and bone, or is it the ball joint itself that wears out ? In other words is it the number of revolutions of the joint that make it fail or is the level of impact that loosens the stem.
I would love to return to low impact sports such as swimming and cycling but wonder if this can wear out the ball joint prematurely. I would like to get 20 years use if possible before revision.
  Anyone wth an opinion or first hand experience please get in touch

Must admit the first few weeks were not good and the lying on the back for 11 weeks was so difficult but it has been so worth it. No pain, more mobility.  I can go walking with no trouble. Did 14 mile one day was knackered but not with the hip, did have lots of sit downs though.

"Hi everyone- I have had intermittent stiffness and pain from the right sacroiliac joint for years which finally began to be more noticeable in right groin, and hip damage from osteoarthritis was diagnosed with all the usual X-rays. Surgery for hip replacement is on 13 March and I'm assured there is no reason why it shouldn't go well.
only problem is that before all the THR discussion kicked off, I first went to the doctor with a painful left knee and he diagnosed a Baker's cyst. This is almost more of a problem at the moment than the hip,and is waking me up most nights. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do about it? I shall be putting more weight on my knee when recovering from the hip, and I don't want to do more damage. Is chiropractic/physio/massage likely to help?

"Hi All
Just popped over from the TKR forum as i had my 6wk post Op consultation today with my Surgeon and he was very happy with my progress and how the knee is after a TKR on 18/01/17, he said right we can move onto the the Hip now (planned before and known it was the next Op after the knee)  So i was sent off for further X Rays, and am now on the waiting list for this next Op (All due to a motorcycle accident back in the 80's, which left my left leg shorter than the right)
To cut a long story short, femur. Tib and Fib were all compound fractures, Tib ended up a non union, and ended up back in for a bone graft and external fixation in 86.
If that was not enough it has also caused spinal issues, and i was to under go a spinal fusion last January 2016, but it was cancelled due to these joint issues, so all in all i will be back to the Neuro Surgeon's for a final decision on surgery or not after i have recovered from the hip replacement.

Firstly he cheerily told me he remembered me !!
Didn't know whether to laugh or cry ...
Said it's not normal at 5 months . Started to repeat his last comment in December saying if this was a conference I would use your x Ray as perfect example .. and I said yes you told me that but it doesn't really help does it ?
I asked could it be muscle damage and he said ' not really ' .How does he know this ? He did NOT examine my
Leg at all . Asked was I still in physio ? Well
Not since the NHS standard hip classes of weeks ago . So he seems a bit mystified and has referred me back to physio and ordered blood tests there and then to rule out infection . Said it could be referred pain ? I told him all the muscles in my leg ache when I poke them !
Worrying thing is no MRI offered and if no improvement in three months a referral to pain management clinic .
Anyone experience this and what do they do there ? I am not imagining this pain !
Any ideas guys ?

"I'm now 7 months post op FRHR and doing very well.  For the most part I don't hurt anymore and almost back to normal with my regular activities with the exception of just one major thing.  I love gardening.  Flower beds, vedgetables, etc..., but I'm finding that when I try to get back up from the squating position, I feel very weak and causes pain for a few minutes afterwards.  My question is for anyone who has reached this monthly milestone or beyond.  Do I need to do more strengthening exercises? 
I won't go back to see my surgeon until the end of this month to ask him, so just wondering if anyone else might know the answer.
Thanks,
Kim

"Morning all.
Had LTHR 6 months ago. Still quite stiff and sometimes a bit painful, think partly because mum had a broken pelvis when i was 8 weeks post op so didn't really have time to fully recover myself before hospital visits, which meant driving part way and then train and bus as it was too uncomfortable to drive all the way to London, and caring for her once she was home, again a 40 minute drive.  But to get back to the subject :-) i see a lot of people saying pilates is good, i have also had other hip replaced 3 years ago, that one is fine no problem at all.  When i asked my physio how long it would be until i could sit on the floor to play with grandkids, she told me probably never. Was wondering if a lot of pilates is floor work?

Now she's having some real problems shaking a virus she's caught and is feeling down. But she's one of the greatest things about this forum, so I thought we could cheer her up!
?When I first came here I knew I was having a THR and there was no choice in it. I was totally fine about it. Until I read the posts on this site! Then I was ""OMG, what am I getting into, this operation seems to leave everyone feeling awful!"" Renee was the one who told me that this was a minority of cases, and not to worry. Yes things could go wrong, but they didn't often. She made me feel much better about it. AND she made me feel part of the group and encouraged me to get involved.
?Renee is one of the backbones of this site - always there, always cheerful, always caring. Anyone else got a story about Renee to cheer her up???

"Day 7 Update!
Click here to view image
I was anxious to leave the hospital and come home two days post op but looking back I think maybe another day would have been a good idea as I struggled with pain management at home and the nights were rough (Oh for the hospital bed!!) however it has got so much better and I am grateful for the small improvements.
Last night was a better night and I slept in 3 hour bursts which was a huge improvement. Still using paracetemol and ibuprofen spread through the day and it takes the edge off.
Walking around on one crutch now apart from the middle of the night bathroom trips and have mastered the stairs, dressing, showering. Still hurts to sit on scar and uncomfortable sitting generally but hoping that will get better soon. Very little swelling apart from around the hip itself and no bruising which has amazed me. Changed dressing yesterday and all looks very neat and clean with invisible stitches covered with steri-strips.
One of the worst things was the post op constipation!! Wish I'd taken the lactulose earlier - started once home - as it took a good few days to sort out and was so uncomfortable!
Slowly getting my head around lack of independence - not sure I was quite prepared for how reliant I would be in OH for everything! Hard to get used to and have had a few tears but feeling so much better mentally yesterday and today.

One annoying thing - I am numb down the right thigh. Apparently due to bruised nerve from the clamps they use to get you in position when they operate. It's not sore but feels very strange and apparently may stay this way for a few weeks/months. Anyone else had this?
Will check in again soon but wanted to thank everyone for the support and information - it has made a huge difference to my journey!

When I was discharged on 6th January this year I was on 2 codeine 4 times a day and the same with paracetamol.
In discussion with my GP I've reduced the codeine to 1 four times a day but continue the paracetamol as usual.
It would be lovely not to rely on medication.
Also does anyone take any supplements e.g cod liver oil or glucosamine.

A combination hot/cold therapy, rest, no heavy lifting, on a muscle relaxant at night and usual ipubrofen. My surgeon has told me it is my choice when I saw him in January.

"My friend who is a 52 year old woman had a THR on September 27, 2017. She was discharged home without a brace or without home care. She did go to PT for 6 wks before her first dislocation. Then she was fitted with a brace which she wore continuously except to shower. 2 weeks later another dislocation in late November.Then on December 12 , she had total hip revision surgery which included a locking mechanism thT would ""prevent any further dislocations"" as she was told by her surgeon. She was discharged with a much better brace this time and told to not do any physical therapy and minimal activity to give it time to heal. She developed a fever and was admitted to the hospital on December 20. This time with a raging staphylococcus infection in her hip. The surgeons then removed all hardware, flushed the site and cemented a temporary hip with a spacer and beads filled with time-release antibiotics. She was discharged home with instructions for 6 weeks of antibiotic infusion therapy 3 x per day. After about 3 weeks her pain became increasingly worse to the point of not being able to bear weight on that hip at all. After 6 weeks of antibiotics, she was advised to take a 2 week antibiotic holiday and then have fluid from the hip to be tested for infection. Less than one week into the so-called ""holiday"", she again was admitted into the hospital with excruciating pain that became unbearable! The infection had returned or not been alleviated after all and The surgeon performed an emergency surgery to remove all hardware. The surgeon explained that after they opened her up they found and enormous abscess larger than a grapefruit around her temporary hip! Now she is in recovery with a cemented temporary hip without a joint. She will have another 8weeks of infusion therapy before she will have yet another surgery, her 4th, before she can begin the long haul to recovery. We are curious to know if anyone has experienced having a temporary hip with no joint and if so, what are some tips for getting more mobility and will she eventually be able to move about with less pain? It's two days after this surgery and she said it feels like when she takes a step it feels like her foot sinks into ""quicksand"". Any help is greatly appreciated.

"Hi everyone, ... I was just curious about something .....my history is that I was born with a dislocated left hip (hip dypslasia) it was fixed but not till I was three, I am 49 now... Ive always had hip issues as it was still weaker , but until about 5 /6 years ago it did not impact too much on my life however since then it's all went downhill , I've got bone and bone and had for several years, and I now limp and have done for ages.  I've been very reluctant to ""give in"" and have a hip replacement having had cortisone and more intensive hip injections into my joint in theatre, but I realise that my only option is a THR so I'm now on the waiting list.  
My question is about my hip flexibility or lack of it.  My good hip has been checked and is fine and last time it was xrayed showed no signs of arthritis, however the flexibility now  in my good hip is as bad if not worse than my bad hip if that makes sense.  I've always had a bit of restriction in how I could move my bad hip but still managed to climb stairs get into cars etc, but since my hip has deteriorated that has got worse, but what worries me is my good hip is now just as bad when climbing stairs, and I'm at the stage where I can't climb into a bus or anything as I can't raise my good leg up high enough  to step in, let alone my bad one.  Is this just because of my lack of General movement that my flexibility has gone.  Im just concerned about my good hip and wondering if once I have my hip replacement if I will manage to improve things in my good hip as well as obviously my hip replacement .
I know my alignment is terrible and my consultant said my hip socket was rotated too, so I obviously need straighten up, whether that's got anything to do with my flexibility or not I'm not sure.  It's just worrying as we have had several occasions where I've had to climb into a mini bus taxi or a small coach and I can hardly climb up the step to get into it, so that's another thing I can't or am struggling to do,  I just wondered if anyone experienced anything similar .

"Hi, I've just found this group, I wish I had found it before my op as it gives a wealth of information. I had my THR on 14th Feb, The operation had been put on hold for about 4 years due to different reasons so I was relieved to have it finally done.
The operation was done under spiinal aneathetic and took 2.5 hours the reason being, I was told afterwards, was due to a trainee surgeon undertaking the operation. Unfortunately the spinal wore off towards the end of the op and the last 10 minutes were very uncomfortable. I was given the option of being put  to sleep but refused due to my sleep aponea.
Regardless of this the nursing staff and physios were brilliant and I felt very positive about my recovery and was discharged 17th Feb.
My problem is since coming home I have slept on and off most of the day. A thing I didn't do in the hospital. I can't even say this is due to pain relief as I have only had the pain meds I was on prior to going into hospital, refusing morphine, again because of my sleep aponea.
Just wondered if others had suffered with this and advise please on how to deal with it.
Also my operated leg seems to be falling outwards when I lay in bed, is this normal?

"I'm 7 weeks post op so am now walking well on 2 sticks and sometimes 1 if not uneven. I'm out of hip precautions so can drive and am trying to get back to normal slowly. Though I've been told not to lift anything heavy, walk through mud or ride my horse until 12 weeks.
So on the surface I must seem 'normal'.
I went to the stables this morning to see my horse and just do some gentle grooming. When I asked someone if they could take my horses rug off as it was heavy, I was told it's not heavy and to stop milking the situation.
Later as the weather was lovely some of the people were going riding. I said I wished I could join them but I've got to wait until 12 weeks.
Again the reaction was they wouldn't bother with that, they'd get on and ride and that I should be doing more.
I just replied that I'm not risking the progress I've made so far and that the muscles take a long while to heal after major surgery.
Has anyone else had experience of friends showing lack of understanding.

"Hi.  I have been lurking for a few weeks and have found a wealth of information on THR. Thank you.  I am on list for a total right hip replacment, I am 55 and had a childhood hip problem, which was pinned at 12 and quite good overall til about 5 years ago, and then it deteriorated badly over last year. I dont have a date but I am on the list.  I am pretty terrified, but looking forward to hopefully being without this constant, at best nagging pain, at worst you all know the story... anyway on the scale of things this might turn out to be a daft or pointless worry. The one thing that is really freaking me out is the though of a urinary catheter. To the point I dont want visitors until it is out as I find it so embarrasing. also unpleasant for husband and daughter. It just gives me the heeby jeebies! I had a caesarian and had one then and as well as it felt horrible coming out I ended up with infection. Did everyone have catheter or does it depend on type of aneasthetic, spinal block etc... sorry to be a woose.

Last week I engaged in some more strenuous hill walking for a couple of hours, I felt fine afterwards but next day had severe pain in thigh and buttock; I thought this was probably due to using muscles that had not been stretched for last few years, however the pain has persisted and a week on shows no sign of abating.

"At my 6 weeks review last week I mentioned that I was still getting pain around the base of the wound area. Particularly if I'd been sitting and clothes rubbing the area it became quite sore.
She explained that during surgery the nerves had to be cut and that they were repairing themselves.
She suggested massaging the area over the wound every day with a moisturizing cream. I've done this now for nearly a week and the pain has gone.
I also use the cream to massage the whole of my leg as it was very dry after being painted by the surgeon. This makes me stretch down my leg as far as possible. A little further each day. I can now reach my ankles and get my sock on without the sock aid.
All good and no pain in my hip.

So Wednesday was also the lifting of my travel ban. I was disappointed not to have any news headlines about this. So I can now do short haul. I promptly booked myself flights to Greece at Easter for me and my dog. Ok, it would have been nice to drop everything and just take off, but not all that convenient. Plus Easter is a great time. I have loads of unused leave from this year, so for 9 days leave I will get nearly three weeks off due to all the bank holidays. Three weeks of sunshine. Yay!!!!
So, of course, the only downside to all this is that darned ankle. But this week I challenged myself to ditch the crutches and use only my stick for the whole week. That isn't quite as exciting as it sounds, as I had almost nowhere I needed to walk to! Around the house, around the office, from the car outside the office... Not exactly a half marathon! But I have also been trying to get at least two 5 minute sessions on the treadmill per day, and more when I am working from home or not working. So the good news is that even with my still limited mobility, I have lost 4 lbs in the last two weeks. That is huge for me, as I piled on so much weight last year when I spent most of the year unable to walk to the kitchen! 
Still working on the whole 60th birthday thing. Central America will have to wait until next year. So I am planning two holidays over a month. The first is a cruise on a working ship up (and back down) the Scandinavian coast, sailing from Newcastle to Bergen to pick up the boat. That avoids flying in case I am pre-op / post-op for the ankle. And then I will collect my dog and proceed to Islay for the Islay and Jura whisky trail, spending my actual birthday at the Laphroig distillery, where I own I square foot of peat bog I have never yet visited!!!!
So all in all, the future is bright and sunny! Which is great because right now it's snowing...

"I own my own horse and was riding her until the day before my op. I always felt great once on board when my muscles had warmed up. Dismounting was difficult due to my lack of mobility in my bad hip. Often had to call for help as I'd got stuck!!!!
I've been told I can ride gently at 12 weeks. I always use a mounting block for getting on but need advice for getting off.
Before the op I was riding into the stable and bringing my bad leg over my horses neck and jumping down.
I really don't think this is such a good idea with my new hip because of the impact on landing.
Just wondered if anyone has experience of what to do as I so want to ride again.

"Well it finally came around and I am a bundle of nerves!! Trying to keep myself busy and get everything set up at home.
Have packed for the hospital, signed up for Netflix, put together a basket of ""stuff to do""! Can't imagine being stuck at home for so long, hope it goes by quickly!
Quick question to those who've been through it - am thinking of swapping bed sides to the side nearest the bathroom - it will mean getting into bed on my operated side - does this make any difference? Should I stick to the longer walk around the bed?! Seems to be that you need to go to the loo a lot after the op and want to make it as easy as possible lol! Maybe I'm over-thinking!
Struggling on paracetamol only this weekend. Had to give up the ibuprofen on Friday. Anda glass of wine would be nice too lol! Oh well, not long til it's all over. Will report back when it's done.
Thanks for all the great tips and information. Has been so useful to know what is involved and what to expect, and set up for recovery.

"Six weeks on from having a part of my body sawn off and taken out to be replaced forcefully by items from the periodic table I'm doing OK but as my teacher once said (OK not once, every school report) could do better.
It's almost 3am and here I am again replying to posts on this forum, most of which won't see the light of day due to either the site being rubbish or my iPad deciding that because it's older than four years it has to stop working and shut itself off to remind me that Apple products are not for life, just a few Christmases then it's time to replace.
When I'm not on this forum I'm playing games meant for six year olds, my fave at the moment it AlphaBetty - a ""fun"" spelling game for really little kids.  Well I'm on level 25 and can't get past it.  Some words it actually accepts even though I'm sure they don't exist but it makes me smile as it does accept all forms of swear words so I try to do as many of those as possible just to humour myself until the iPad crashes again.
I cannot get comfy in bed.  My geriatric Persian cat who has not once sat on my lap voluntarily in the 15+ years we have had her has decided that she needs to be near my scar at all times day and night.  Very sweet apart from the fact that she takes up a fair bit of room as she has to lay at a certain angle and as she's my only child I cannot possibly move her or wake her.  When I'm laying on the sofa she gets on top of my operated hip and her full 14lb weight will contentedly purr away, again a bit sore but can't move my baby so hint at daddy having sweets for her and as she's greedy after a while she will seek him out.  Most of the time she wants to kill him and he regularly has a bitten or scratched hand/face, although to be fair he does deserve it most of the time (shouldn't cuddle so tight).

That's another thing - ""rest"".  The week or so following my op the other half was fairly good at helping out, you know - warming up a ready meal and acting like he made Christmas dinner from scratch.  Washing up (how does it take him 35 mins to do what I can in five ?), hoovering (scaring the cat so she will take a swipe at next available opportunity) and changing my stockings.  Yep he did ALL that and still managed to do his day job.  Well now I'm doing everything again, cooking, cleaning, washing, dressing myself and I'm meant to be resting.  It's like he had an out of body experience that won't be repeated.  I'm sure he has vision that doesn't see dirt.  As I couldn't get in the bath I thought I would wait and see how long it took him before he cleaned it - well let's just say I did it around the three week mark as you could have done graffiti in the mark around the side.  Now I'm able to get in the bath again it's bliss - I won't take that for granted for at least a month.
So I'm ""resting"" my pain in the a*** and my aching leg in between my zoo impression walks and yes it's getting better day by day.  I now have some sleeping tablets to take to try and break the cycle of being awake at this hour playing crappy games that make me feel thick (not taking them until Monday though - it's the weekend and I prefer wine to sleep).  This forum and the amazing people have helped immensely and I couldn't imagine going through it without the support.
Anyway I know what you're all thinking - how have I managed to type such a long post ?  Well I type it into Notes then Cut and Paste into here.  Wish I'd thought about that ages ago so that I could have offered more support and a friendly ear.  Honestly the witty remarks you have all missed because of the technology crashing are such a waste.

The spinal lasted for ages - til about 2am before I could get to the loo (feel my legs) - was so lovely to have no pain!
Bit of a drama at 2am as was given liquid morphine. An hour later the most horrendous allergic reaction to it - agonising stomach spasms, couldn't breathe, BP went very low. Was sick. It was very scary but with oxygen, fluid IV and paracetamol in the iv it was under control about an hour later. Clearly morphine is not for me!! They have me on tapentadol now which works like a dream along with ibuprofen and paracetamol. Pain now manageable.
Physio this morning was tough but nice to be up and more this afternoon. Just walking on crutches.
Finding the hardest thing is sitting. Very sore sitting on loo seat but am sure that will only get better.

"Hey Guys,
So I am soon to be 17 and have had CDH, also know as Congenital Dysplasia of the Hip for all of my life.
I have had many surgeries through my life in an attempt to correct this and have always know that I will need a total hip replacement, however, it wasn't anticipated until I was at least 20 or so.
I have come to the decision, with my constant and parents to have a hip replacement now. Through life I have had very limited movement, especially at the left hip. I can't bend at the waist to tie my shoe laces or widen my legs enough to sit cross legged. My hope is that a hip replacement will rectify some of my limitations in life.
However, after reading many things online some have said that bringing your leg above 90 degrees and twisting it in is out of the question.
I therefore call on you, and ask what will be the short and long term limitations of a hip replacement. I would also like to know of any complications in younger peoples ops and how long it took for you or the patient to recover.
I appreciate you taking the time to read this longwinded explanation, and any help or knowledge you could leave behind would be hugely appreciated!

"Hi everyone, I am wondering if anyone is faced with my health problems in relation to having a THR. I am a 66 yr female, with liver disease and very low platelet count which makes surgery more risky. In my pre-assessment, the anaesthetist, gave me some dire warning about my very high risk surgery, suggesting I explore other means to control pain in left hip. 
I was ready to go ahead, having talked to the surgeon twice, who explained the risks, but was happy to go ahead and operate. However what the anaesthetist conveyed to me left me scared and full of doubts to continue, I got an early admission for March this year, but now I have more or less changed my mind about going ahead.
my pain is worst some days and better others, but I can only manage to go to the local shops and back, not the longer walks I once enjoyed.
i have read all the threads of people's experiences, and found then most helpful. Of course since my case is more complex, I would like to hear from anyone with similar situation.

"I have posted before about feeling blue throught this process..
But what im going to do today is.. tell about my journey.. so others who are not there yet.. can get a feel for what its like..
I could barely walk prior .. due to hip dysplasia. as well told I had anteriir subluxation.. I let it go longer than I should due to my mothers illness. which was alzheimers. She passed Spet 2016.. I saw surgeon again in October again.. and gave the Go ahead for surgery.. but I wanted to wait till the end of December..It only deterioted more as time went on.. Prior to I had a diagnosis of Migraine and took 50 mg tompamax daily and as well took 10 mg prozac,, for mild anxiety..
I did feel anxious prior to surgery.. but Honestly.. No one prepraes you for what its really going to be like..
hours after the surgery.. it was like a honeymoon.. I felt no pain.. could walk around the nurses station with a walker.. happily.. After the pain med they gave me in the OR wore off..I was given Oxy..well therein my troubles began.. I threw up multiple times hours later.. which told me that.. It never digested to begin with in my stoamch.. I was so far removed from any pain  med almost 24 hours later..  I felt I could not cope.. I was given zofran for nausea and then given 1 norco..I could barely get through PT without crying.. I was kept one day more.and then released..
NO one can prepare you for what you are going to feel..Iwent two more days with being undermedicated.. unles by the grace of God The surgeon called me and asked how i was doing 4 days later..I was in tears.. he then told me to Take 2 norco.. and one naproxin 500 mg.
Miraculously.. the pain became more manageable.within 4 hours.. and hence.. MY advice.. Ask for more pain med.. NO one knows your pain threshold..dont be shy.. or a hero.. YOu neef t oheal and get through this,,.Fast forward to now.. 8 weeks later..Ive had my minor successes.. not using a walker or cane.. but very wobbly.. 
My surgery was done Anterior LAteral..Ive been walking 2 miles day..for many be a week.. without any use of help..
IT usually feels uncomfortable muscle wise later and the next day..I have had no further PTsice the second week. per my surgerons request..
I am no longer taking pain meds.. NO longer taking Migraine med and NO longer taking Prozac..I feel so clear in my thought process..feel betetr over all.. just cant quite walk straight..
I have no idea if IM going to be released back to work..
Ive been told it taks longer for a cemenetless hip to heal and recover..
MY employer.. well.. IM sure they expect me back.
I work in healthcare.. SLiding heavy pts.. assiting them out of wheelchairs.. Up and down all day long..its a fast pace..
I need to go back to work for my mind..more than any thing.but my doc is very conservatiove..
but what I want to drive home mostly . is this..
If you didnt have the THR.. mostly likely you wold be crippled over time.. IT had to be done.. they were not doing it for sh--ts and grins
Also.. face it.. Its going to hurt.. so ask boldly for pain meds and more if its not cutting it enough for PT.
YOu will feel a wide range of emotion after.. ups and downs..
also.. Dont expect people in your life. to really care that much.. ALL i was told and heard was.. how. a THR is so much easier than all other joints.. so quick ect.. Forget it.. ITs tough.. its going to be alot of work afte the surgery.. and Patience.
Internally celebrate your little successes.little things you where not able to do.. 
Myself I have found I have no joint pain any more.. just alos tof muscles out of whack . also  feel a clicking or something rubbing in there.. 
Have no idea what that is.. but i hope nothing.. I see my Doc on wednesday..I pray to God he feels I can move forward and that I have  done no damage along the way.. Ie Micro MOvement.. only no cement patients will understand that..
I hope this has helped you .. any of you..
I feel proud I finally did it.. you should too..
also ignore peoples rude commetns about why did you need that done or . YOU are so young for that..
You are taking care for YOU>> for YOU.. for the future and YOU can do.. just understand the realitys of it all.Its major surgery..but YOU can get through it..

I've never seen myself as disabled but times like this I often think why do I still work full time . I don't actually know what I want to ask I'm just very frustrated it stops me doing so much.

"I went in for some pain in my hip that I have been dealing with on and off for about 2 years now. Being a walker (5 miles/3 x wk), I just chalked it up to taking too big of strides. The pain would come and go but got worse. I made an appt. to see an orthopedic about it and he did some xrays and a MRI with contrast to visibly see more of the area. I came back the next day and we could see that I have 2 cysts so he referred me to another orthopedic surgeon and viewing my xrays and MRI he proceeded to tell me that I had a labral tear. Upon looking at my xrays he also discovered that I have ""shallow hips"" and gave me my options:
1. Do Nothing
2. Get Cortisone shots until I can't any longer.
3. Fix the labral tear but eventually due to my ""shallow hips"" he said that it would tear again within approx. 5 years and I would have to come in and do it again. 
4. Osteotomy
5. Total Hip Replacement
Being that I am only 38 and active I am at a loss.  I have done so much investigating and found that Total Hip Replacement is the best option for me but I'm terrified. I have made an appointment with him to answer some more questions and make a date to have this done but was wondering what everybody else thinks and perhaps some advise on any other questions that I may need to ask. Please and Thank you!!

"I had my lthr in December 2016, I was on crutches for 14 months before the surgery and have a lot of muscle atrophy because of this. Surgery went perfectly, recovery is great. I am now walking without any walking aids, I do my stretches and physio every day to try and get these shortened muscles to wake up.
For the past two weeks my right hip and surrounding area is in a lot of pain. I was never in pain before the surgery but now my right hip aches and pinches as soon as I use it. Has anyone else experienced their other hip hurting during recovery?
Im hoping its just my muscles aching because I am stretching and doing physio every day, but im terrified that my right hip is going now as well! I have my 12 week consultation with my surgeon soon, but wanted to know others experience.

"My wife had a hip replacement two months ago, and finds our vauxhall Astra seats difficult, even with two cushions on them to raise their height. Ideally we'd have a car with an upright driver/passenger position like those 4x4 's, but we're in a car class or two below that.
Does anyone have ideas about which cars in an Astra class/price have a more upright position - knees more level with one's bottom rather than above it. ? (Ford Focus/Renault Meganne/ honda Jazz/ Skoda Ottavia etc)? We'd be looking for a medium family car - not compact car, but not large saloon, people-carrier either. To be honest, she found the Astra seats low before the operation, and i do understand why - you go right down into them when you get in and really have to ""get up"" out of them afterwards.

"It has now been six months since my hip replacement.
For the most part life is back to normal and I am able to get into London for work and do what I need to do.
I still find I get tired quicker than I did before and, if I over do it, I sometimes get pain in my hip.
I think what holds me back the most now is the response from those around me.  My wife gets concerned if I try to do too much and gets very concerned when I have to travel for work.
The last year has been hard, since breaking my hip and having it replaced.  But I do feel it is now all behind me.  Hopefully the hip will last me a long time and not need replacing.
Good luck to all of you that have had a replacement, or will be having one in the future.

"hello everyone,
I graduated from the shoulder forum finally and glad for all the help and encouragement.  But now I need a new hip, possible 2 and would appreciate any info on this new approach.  From what I read it's been created around 2010 by Dr Jimmy Chow in Arizona and is a combination of the anterior and posterior techniques but does not dislocate the hip or cut muscles during the surgery.  Also leg length is also not an issue because of this technique.  Faster recovery, no restrictions. There are only 2 surgeons in Florida where I am that are certified to do this. And fortunately one is in my city. Has anyone had this particular surgery done and what was your experience please? Any information is greatly appreciated.

"Hi everyone long time since I last posted on here. Well it's been 4 calendar months since my hip op (well in 4 days time. ) 
Feel like I am getting there I think but not 100 percent sure. 
I can now walk around the house without my sticks although I do have a slight trendelenburgh gait walk still ,starts off less at the beginning of the day but is more apparent later as the day goes on .
Although still having problems when I go out without using them , any walking more than 10 minutes leaves me with groin pain for several hours . 
I am hoping it's just weak muscles that are getting used and stretched and it will improve and eventually stop. But I can't help worrying ,could it mean my hip inplant just hasn't taken . 
I read so many peoples positive blogs doing so well at as early as 6 weeks ,I know we all have different experiences .
Would love to hear from anyone who has any similar experiences either way.

"Hi folks, just checking in again at the 10-week stage and wondering if anyone experienced pain going from sitting to standing at this stage?
Basically things had been very good from 6 to 8 weeks, I really felt great and got back into doing a bit more. I don't remember doing any one thing, but possibly I just ramped up the exercise too quickly or did too much.
Basically when I stand from sitting now, I feel noticeable enough pain in my hip itself. It's bad enough that I'd almost be limping for a little while. Then it usually straightens out. 
I know it doesn't sound major but I'm so gutted because I'd been doing so well. Has anyone experienced this and did it go away?

"I had my right hip replaced 6 months ago and I recovered very quickly, walking without sticks within a few weeks.
More recently, however, I've been experiencing pain in my right buttock which extends down my right leg. When I feel for the exact position of the pain in my buttock it is quite close to my scar from my operation.
Is it too long after the successful hip replacement to now have pain. problems?

"Hi fellow hipsters. All has been going slow and steady, despite a tight psoas muscle. While I was lying down this afternoon I reached to my left to grab the phone from my coffee table. I had a major pain in my left hip that shot down the back of my leg.. I was able to move and get up on my feet and wall. After lying back down the pain in my butt (back hip) is throbbing. I am able to do all of my stretches but the pain in the but is overwhelming and I am icing.
Any ideas? I have PT tomorrow.

"Hi all. I am 4 months post LTHR. I am getting a bit concered now as I still struggle to walk much at all with or without a crutch. I get pain in my lower back on the left hand side, almost at the top of my buttock when I walk. It feels like a throbbing headache in there. Also, my scar is sore to put a bit of pressure on, even slightly.
My doctor sent me for an X-ray to make sure all was ok and then I had a blood test to see if there may be a small infection. All has came back clear and I just don't know what it could be then. I have no flexibility whatsoever in the left side, and I have done my excersises.
Has anyone else experienced this or have any feed back please.

"Hi everyone, I'm a new member. my 72 year old husband had a THR on 7/2/17. Operation went very well according to the surgeon. The day after the operation he became unwell, no appetite & stomach pains. The Nurse suggested one of the prescribed meds may not agree with him. Two days later he is feeling much better but salts are low and is on restricted water. A blood test has revealed a problem with his white blood cells. No other information forthcoming from the medical staff. The OT is very happy with his progress so it seems the other issues are delaying his discharge from hospital. Just wondered if this was a common following THR surgery.

"I had my total hip replacement 25 days ago (cementless,ceramic) . My doctor told me not to bear weight around 3 weeks. It seemed to be ok until the end of 2nd week though, pain came back in my left pubic area (probably muscles since there is no more dead bone there) I have 2 cm leg length discrepancy (longer on the operated side) and my knee hurts too. I assume (hope) the pain in my joint area is only because of the surgery (muscles around the joint are hard as a rock according to other side). My doctor told me that it will be ok and I need some patience. Some people get rid of all the pain immediately after surgery or in 2-3 weeks, and this makes me uncomfortable considering myself not doing much better yet. I appreciate your comments and share your experiences if you have similar to mine.

"Hello to all! As a lot of you all know I had right hip surgery this past July 3 weeks later at my first checkup I find out I dislocated it! 2 days later I'm having to have a total hip revision.....today marks 6 months from that surgery. I saw my dr yesterday, had X-rays and all is well. Dr says bone has grown quite well into my new hip. Saws now I can try the incumbent bike and the abductor and adductor weight machines at the gym. Says because my hip muscles were so weak and short for so many years due to my deformed hip it's going to take time for the muscles to grow stronger and function properly. One of my most irritating thing is the nerve pain located at the top of my thigh and to the side of thigh. I've been using a cream to help desensitize the nerves and help with the pain. Dr has prescribed lyrica. Haven't tried it yet. So my journey is still long, I still get discouraged and cry, but I'm starting to feel better most of the time. It's hard sometimes but I'm getting there!! Thanks for all your support and advice!! God's blessings to all!!

On the 30th I got my feet tangled up getting in the shower and broke my left femur, didn't realize it until the following week when I had my first follow-up x-rays. Jan 8th I had my femur repaired along with tendons and ligaments and a left hip revision. I am making progress in my recovery after inpatient rehab and now outpatient physical therapy which I am still undergoing. I attend that 3 times per week and have exercises to do at home 2 other days. I also have RA. In the past few days I have started having increased nighttime leg pain as well as discomfort at times during the day. I have progressed to using a 4 prong cane about 75% of the time. I do still use my walker sometimes at home. My question is does anyone have any suggestions to help with sleep. I'm still on my back although never a back sleeper prior to this. I take ambient for sleep, have for years, although it isn't helping now. I see my surgeon on Tuesday. Hoping for some helpful input from experience. Thanks

I would love to hear from anyone who has had two THRs and how long they waited between operations ( and why ).
  It would also bw interesting to hear the views of anyone who has had a THR about whether their physical or mental state would be good enough to go through the operation again after only 8 weeks

"Hello, I'm new to this site/forum and was just seeking some advice if possible?
I am 48 and due to get a left hip resurfacing (Birmingham) op in 3 weeks.
However I am having second thoughts about having this at this stage of of my life. I definatey need the op but right now I can walk pretty much pain free, cycle 60 km a week and play football to a decent standard. I am not on any medication at all and although I experience pain in my knee and shins daily, it's not agony and it doesn't keep me awake at night at all.
Question is, should I wait until the daily pain become more unbearable and making activities impossible. I did get an cortisone injection into my hip in Oct  2016 and I wondering if I am still feeling the benefits of this.
I no doubt will need the op but I was wondering if it's worth delaying a little longer? I get it through my Employers health insurance so rescheduling not an issue.
Appreciate your thoughts and thanks in advance.

"Hi - I had my THR about 2 months ago. I am 57 yrs old. My recovery has been going very well until recently. I had been walking mostly without a cane until a few days ago. Lately, I have had a problem with thigh pain when walking. The pain is strong enough that I have gone back to using a walker.
The pain occurs as I am stepping forward and put my weight down on my leg. My leg is straight and moderately stiff at that time. My thigh and hip muscles have become tense as a result.
There is no pain at all when the knee is bent, and no pain at all while sitting or lying down. The pain only occurs when I am walking.
Using a walker has reduced the pain while walking, but the pain is not getting any better.
What can I do at this point?

But then there is NO follow up on muscle damage , trauma, rigidity, tension , weakness etc etc . Physio here is just showing you how to do leg exercises .
My muscles in operated leg are ' horrible ' he said, some wasted , rigid, stiff, scar tissue etc and no wonder I am still in pain accompanied by leg length discrepancy that still feels odd ( another appt podiatry March) .

"I am planning to have the right hip replacement posterior surgery in late March. I meet with my surgeon on March 7th to plan a  final surgery date. One concern I have is what you can and can not do after surgery and for how long. I read for posterior surgery you can not bend beyond 90 degrees. Is this for a short period of time or permanent after surgery? Also I read you can't cross your legs or turn foot inward. I do lots of walking at work, and in and out of a car several times a day. Also, some occasional lifting and bending as work. I would not call it heavy manual labor, but mild to moderate. The 90 degree restriction concerns me especially if it is long term. Any information appreciated on posterior post- surgery restrictions and how long they are in place. I am thinking I will be out of work 4-6 weeks minimum and with some modifications when I return to work, at least for awhile. I have two co-workers who had hip replacement and returned in under a month but mostly at desk jobs.

The whole experience has been different and although I knew not to expect the two experiences to be the same I had hoped that by now I would be getting back to 'normal' and be painfree! However, instead of the pain getting better it seems to be getting worse. There was a day last week that I literally couldn't put any weight on my leg at all. Any ideas what could be causing this?  Also, we don't get any physical therapy here - just a sheet with exercises to follow. I wondered if I should go and see a physio or wait to see specialist nurse as I have an appointment to see her later this month?!!

"Hi all,
Just want to ask a question, is it normal to see a physical therapist after having THP.
I had my left hip replaced 2 weeks ago and it's standard practice not to see a physio after you get out of hospital.
I was in hospital for 3 days and saw the physio twice. I was given exercises to do but told that I wouldn't see a physio before the 6 week check up. I also was told that I wouldn't need the bandage changed until the 6 week check up as well!
Now I am lucky that I was seeing a physio before the op and he has kept in contact with me and is seeing me next week for a session!

"Hi Everyone,
With both my hip surgeries, I did, at times, feel extremely low. Residing on my own and coping with all the restrictions; it was tough. I love to write poetry and I have composed the following for all of you who may be feeling as I did.
YOU ARE.
iN THE DARKNESS YOU STAND FEELING HELPLESS AND WEAK.   THE CLOUDS TURN GREY.  YOUR SPIRITS' FALLS.  THE SHADOWS DARK AND GRIM.  TURN AWAY MY FRIENDS FROM THOSE DARK THOUGHTS TO SEEK THE PERSON WITHIN.   YOU ARE AN OYSTER IN WHICH CONTAINS A PRECIOUS PEARL.   A RAINBOW AGLOW WITH SPLENDIFEROUS LIGHTS.   A CLOUD DANCING IN THE SWEET REDOLENT BREEZE.   A NIGHT SKY ABALAZE WITH CORUSCATING STARS.   A NEW BUTTERFLY AWAITING TO SPREAD ITS WINGS.   ALL OF THESE THINGS YOU ARE MY FRIENDS.   YOU MY FRIENDS.   YOU ARE.
I have had to write it as one paragraph.
God Bless you all.
Love, Blessings and Hugs,
Maureen xxx

"Good afternoon hippies!
i haven't been on here for a while, but I was wondering if any of you good people could help?!
I had my right hip replaced in March last year, I cannot believe the difference it has made in the (almost) year! 
However... I guess you knew that was coming!
on Sunday I slipped on some ice, I was carrying my 3 year old on my left, and that leg slipped forwards, so I landed on the knee of my right leg.. it hurt!!
i thing anyone's hip would hurt if they fell the way I did, anyway I carried on with the rest of the day, it was aching but seemed ok.
i have also been suffering from a heavy cold and a cough these last couple of weeks, but my cough is sometimes quite a big cough and it really feels like it is pulling on my hip.
I am now not sure what is possibly a fall or the cough, as today it seems to be getting worse, and wondered if anyone else has come across this pain when coughing??
sorry for the long story!!
If anyone can help that would be great.

"My first operation was in February 2015 (left side). Before the operation I was walking with a walking stick for no longer than 150 meters and was probably going to lose my job.
My second in March 2016, which was also showing bad wear.
?I am 52 in May and have been given my life back again after three very difficult years. I am now back to working normally without any form of assistance. I am commuting to work by bike again and also managed to finished three century rides on it.
I am British, living and working in France. Even though I was operated under the French medical system I m sure I can help someone in what I have experienced.
I wish I had found this site before I was operated on. Please feel free to ask me any questions.

"Hi fellow Hippies,
My last TRHR was on the 30th September. The first, carried out on the 16th January, 2016,  When, last November, I saw my Consultant, I told him that I felt off balance and  that my right leg appeared to be longer.  I was shown my X Ray and informed me that I had a pelvic tilt. However, I wasn't really convinced, and thought this might just be a ""cop out"". At the advice of a Rehabilitation Coach, from my Health Club,I did, last Thursday, see my Chiropractor. He measured me in the following manner.  Whilst lying on my back, and using a tape measure, he aligned equally across my pelvic bones. From these points, he asked that I place a finger onto the measure. He then, whilst I held the measure, took it along the inside of each leg and to the ankle bone. I held my breath until he informed me that both legs were of identical lengths .Still on my back, he then took the measure to just above my tummy button and again,whilst I held it, he measured down the inside of each leg and to the ankle. This revealed that my left leg and not my right, was almost an inch longer and that my pelvis was, indeed, tilted. My Chiro, whom I have known for sixteen years, corrected the tilt and praised the two Consultants who had carried out the surgeries. He then advised that, although my core strength was good, the muscles within my bottom were extremely weak.  He gave me gentle stretching and strengthening exercises and told me to return to my Aqua Areobic classes, but to take it very slowly because, to overdo it, would cause more problems.
Lots of people on this forum have complained of leg length discrepancies when some or, as in my case, all the discrepancy was due to my pelvis becoming twisted. This, is generally caused, by the body endeavouring to over compensate and, with osteoarthritis, is apparently, extremely common.
So before you go off and buy those insoles. Firstly, ensure that you actually need them. Or, that you obtain the correct measurement.
I hope this has been helpful and I wish you all a speedy recovery.
Lots of hugs and blessings,
Maureen

"I had a full hip replacement 6 months ago.  Since the surgery, I've been experiencing an aching pain that runs from the top of my femur down to mid femur.  I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the metal part that was hammered into the bone to hold the joint in place.  It hurts when the weather is cold and/or if I carry anything over 10 lbs.  I'm hoping that this pain is just short term.  Is there anyone else out there who is having or has had the same issue?

"Hi, newbie here!!
I had a silent hip replacemnt on my right side in 2009 aged 30, after suffering with pain for a few years, was told it was oesteoarthitis and had a hip athroscopy in the Feb 2009, had a large labral tear that couldnt be fixed, so had the silent hip replacement in the November same year.  I was told I would probably need left side doing in future.  Was left with half an inch leg length discrepancy, which i didnt think affected me after returning to full active lifestyle approx 6 mths after replacement (gym and netball) and even had my second pregnancy and birth no problems, started having more and more back problems last year so was referred to podiatry and given insoles.  also referred to physio as getting more and more pain in my left hip and walking with a limp again.  Currently waiting to see consultant to find out what is going on with left side.
Just wondered if anyone has had silent hip as i beleive its still not that common?
Thanks

My mum is +++anxiuos, almost phobic and terrified of whole op incl. recovery.  She is overweight and just ok for surgery. My questions:  Is general anasthetic an option? We are in UK. How does being obese hamper recovery, apart from the obvious. IE will pain be immediately less except for healing pain. Weight bearing will be substantial - is this a massive factor.Is she likely to need hoisted in hospital?  We see consultant tomorrow - are there any key things i should be asking. Mum is 73. Thanks

"I was told by my doctor four weeks ago the x-rays show severe arthritis on the right hip and it needs to be replaced. He said to wait as long as possible and maybe a few years if pain can be managed, but the past couple weeks the pain has increased and now keeps me awake at night, especially waking me up a few hours early.  So I am going back to see him this week and see if the surgery can be pushed up sooner. I take Meloxicam 15 mg but it still hurts. I added Tylenol Arthritis, 2 tabs at night and it does help some. More important I am getting major insomnia. I always had insomnia issues and take Lunesta, but even that is not helping right now. Since taking the Meloxicam, the Lunesta seems less effective. I may go back to Aleve as seem like insomnia wasn't as bad.  Not sure if side effects there or not. So looks like a vicous cycle here where insomnia and hip pain feed off each other and causing anxiety.  The hip pain is from the buttock to the thigh to the knee and even the foot. Not severe pain, just low grade consistant pain, it does respond to rest and ice some. Also, seems like low pressures and storms make it worse. I know a co-worker who did the non invasive hip surgery and was back to work in less than a month. Hope I am that lucky. Anyone had experience like this and what was helpful. Any ideas appreciated.

"Hi all! As I lie here working up the energy to jump in the shower (it isn't the bathing problem that is a problem I am going to attempt to shave my legs - don't worry I will be sitting on a bath chair, just no way I can stand that long). One or two questions have popped in my head I will ask my surgeon on Wed. but they are pain related and he has never exprienced what we have gone through. 
When my hip acts up and throbs it affects me physically - my appetite disminishes (but I do drink more liquids) which isn't suprising because when I push myself just to do normall stuff like doing dishes or taking a shower I get dizzy and sick to my stomach - is this common with pain? Like even when the hip is only throbbing and I am like ok this is manageable more annoying than making me run for pain killers, but after standing at the sink for five minutes washing dishes - a wave of dizziness hits me and everything seems to be swimming, I break out in a cold sweat or my skin feels calmy and my stomach starts to roll. When I move to sit down to calm down the hip is still just throbbing but than I will feel sharp pains or my fave pulling pains in the groin. 
I was just wondering how pain affects anyone else I know that eveyone expriences everything different. It is really curiousity it is more of trying to make sense of pain (yeah I know pain will really never make sense) and to make it relateable. 
And one other question that might fit the strange question section is - Has anyone started really sneezing after their hip replacement? Ever since I had my second hip replacement about 6 years ago - it started exactly a month or so after surgery. I began to sneeze at least 15 times a day sometimes even up to 30 times in a day. I did see an allergy specialist and he put me on two different allergy pills and they did nothing and I had no allergies from the tests. But here is the kicker ever since I went to the er about a week ago now and was given the higher pain killers - shots and t3 with codene from the dentist I have not sneezed once -not once. Can sneezing be related to pain or has the infection in my body been there for years and my body was trying to tell me in a weird way? Anyway just wondering - Thanks all

"I had a total right hip replacement on jan 4 2017 I had an anterior approach. I'm waking without my cane in the house but if I go any where I take it because I still can't walk fast and still a slight limp. My knee is starting to get better and not hurting as much, but the groin mucles is. I noticed my lower back on that side hurts really bad to where I can't even stand up straight is this normal to and how long does this last? Also I worry about my progress, should i be able to walk better and should I be concerned about having a slight limp still? Also I get really stiff really easy, from sitting to long or in certain positions is that normal to? The stiffness hurts. Sorry I just don't know what to expect or what is normal at this stage. They used glue on my incision, parts of my incision looks like it dips or it's pulling almost looks puffy or swollen, no signs of infection. My first post-op is Feb. The 2nd.

"I am 6 and a half weeks post bilateral THR anterior approach. I'm 45 years old and mostly have been doing great since surgery. I started back to work, albeit from home, after 2 weeks, released from physical therapy and driving after 4 weeks, and at this point I feel better than the entire year of 2016. Still need to get range of motion and strength back, but I couldn't be happier that I went through with surgery.
However, at my 6-week post op appointment with my surgeon this week, he mentioned that I have SI joint arthritis as well, and may need to continue taking NSAIDs. I realize this may seem minor, but I was hoping to stop taking anything for pain and was just so hoping to get back to normal and be much more active again without pain. Until hip osteoarthritis got me to the point of limping, I was a runner.
And now my lower back seems to be hurting the past few days, even as my hips continue to feel better and heal, and I wonder if this is the SI joint arthritis already here to take the place of my previous hip pain. Ugh!
Does anyone else have experience with this or have any suggestions? Thank you!

"My mother and I were talking about her failed THP (I have had a THP as well, so we have plenty to talk about) and we have since found out my mother's failed hip replacement was due to her being forced to do strenuous exercises too soon, and the angles she was put in by the physio caused severe problems. The consultant confirmed this by showing us the perfect xray of her hip before she left the hospital, and the one after she had been to see the physio and then ended up back at the hospital.
This is no way intended to scare you into not using a physio, I loved mine and she got me walking without a limp and exercising properly in no time. I am forever indebted to my physio for giving me courage and confidence. However... not every physio can do hip replacements or indeed are trained to do so.
The lesson is please do not have complete faith in every instruction of any physio, if you feel uncomfortable DONT do it. There are good ones out there as well as bad ones. Research yours carefully. My mum was too scared to say anything at the time, and just did what she was told, and she paid the ultimate price. 
I wanted to share this with you to ensure other hipsters protect their hips, and even though you feel vulnerbable after surgery and perhaps less assertive than usual, if you are not sure, don't do it!

"My wife had THR of the right hip TWICE in May 2016. She is short (hasn't grown and inch since she was 10 YO) at 4'11"". She had been at level 10 pain, and she was put on percocet every 6 hours, since about January 1 and the hip had been deemed ""bone on bone"". After the first surgery the Dr told me ""that was the worst hip I've ever seen"". The first time he used a ""press and fit"" joint.
Either in surgery, or immediately afterward her right femur shattered. They used an abduction pillow which was sized for someone 6 foot tall, and strapped it first at the ankle and shoved up up to her crotch. After the first surgery, the right foot was laying flat on its side (opposite of pigeon toed) and we were told ""you just need to prop it up with a pillow"". It went undiscovered for 3 weeks while doing weight bearing physical therapy. The Dr asked ""why weren't you screaming"" and my wife said ""because it was only level 7 pain and it didn't hurt as bad as it had been"".
He had to change out the hip completely to the older model that needed glued, plus he put in 3 cables to hold the bone fragments together. After the second surgery the foot stayed upright by itself but was pigeon toed. Before this surgery I told the Dr that we did not want an abduction pillow and asked him what he would use on a child. He said they would use a knee brace on a child, so I said ""she is so short that's what you should use on her"" and they did.
The pain level was still at 7 six weeks after surgery when the surgeon took her off percocet every 6 hours cold-turkey and changed to Norco every 12 hours. Within 24 hours she had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance because the pain was at level 10. After 4 shots of fentanyl and 2 percocet, the pain level was back to 5 and she's been on percocet every 6 hours since.
She has had 6 months of physical therapy where the primary goal was to strengthen the leg so the foot was not pigeon toed.
Her pain level today is still at 5 with taking 1 percocet every 6 hours. She is only able to walk unassisted with a walker (or with a cane provided someone is holding the gait belt).
From what I read, this is not normal. Should we be investigating a second Opinion? Should we be hiring a malpractice Attorney?
Please help!

"Let's all face it, we have been in pain for years with these hip problem. From the time the pain starts until you reach the point of time to do something about this, is awefull.  The pain has taken our quality of life away from us, and you see no relief inshight. But once you reach that point of I do not care how old I am or how scared I am to have the surgery I'm going to get it done.  At that moment our mind set needs to change from neg to pos.  From that moment forward things will get better, maybe not as fast as we want, but they will.  I decided at 46 enough was enough, I'm way too young to be living like this.  At that moment I started thinking of nothing more then being pain free and how to get there.  I started looking at the replacement as a positive rather then a negitive.  On Dec 1 2016 I schedule my THR for Dec 21 2016, and carried a positive attitude into my surgery.  I am now 5 weeks post op.  In the last 5 weeks I have streched and done PT everyday, not without out pain but without a negitive attitude.  I have to tell you all as I sit here today, I walk with no limp and my pain is very little.  I have heard many people on here say to others not to over do it, and I do agree with that.  But with a positive attitude and some hard work we can all get thru this.  God bless us!!!

"I am experiencing pain in my surgery leg close to the ankle. Not too bad during the day, but hurts so much at night I am unable to sleep. Tomorrow will be a week since I had surgery. Am I expecting relief too soon? There is mild swelling around the ankle which I understand is normal. Just want to see if anyone else might have experienced this. The surgery was done using the lateral approach. Using the walker with no problem and taking medication as instructed. Thanks for any advice anyone can provide.??

"Hi. I've had a THR done on my left hip 1 yr ago.(left side incision, standard procedure operation, titanium parts used) I am doing quite well. 56 yr old female in good physical condition. I'm wondering about some stuff. 1) Is the 90o sitting restriction a permanent thing? 2) Am I allowed to squat down or could it pop out? 3) Is the tiny popping or clicking sound normal in some movements?

"I'm 7 months post op from a right THR and realised over the past couple of months that I can no longer kneel down.  It's not that I don't have the flexibility, it's that the pain (mainly from the knee on the operated leg) is excruciating (the other knee is slightly better).
Has anyone else experienced this?
I'm dreading that it might mean that I will also have to have knee replacements too.

"Hi, I had a hip re-surface 10 years ago then a total hip replacement 5 years ago. New hip has been fantastic until 4 weeks ago. Had a series of throat/chest infections so doc was worried about infection problems on joint. Had x-rays and blood tests last week and all have come back clear.
Hip still hurting though and thigh goes 'tight' after walking a bit like it was when I needed THR. I have no idea what to do now. Doc obviously thinks everything is ok. Any suggestions?

"August 15 I had a THR . During surgery they found a detached Gluteous Minimus tendon. They reattached the tendon and I began my healing. My hip was great but I could not walk without my crutches. I was on 2 crutches for 4 weeks then 1 crutch for another 5 weeks.
Then my struggle for normal walking began. It was a long road with sciatica and thigh muscle pain. Finally 21 weeks after surgery I got the OK to start running with my dogs in Agility. I am entered in my first trial February 5. I still can not run fast yet. I feel like a penguin trying to run. The one dog I am going to compete with is good so we will have fun. Hopefully I will be able to move better soon.
To all of you beginning don't give up you can do this.

"Hoping someone can help. I'm feeling quite sorry for myself. I've been running a low grade fever ( generally 100-101) since Sunday. I've been trying to cut back on pain meds but when the chills and aches start it's a little brutal on both my legs. I'm also in bed for most of the day. Also, I'll probably have to miss my daughter's concert tonight. So, not much in the grand scheme but it's frustrating. Should I be worried about the fever since it's low?

"Good evening my fellow hippies!
I am 2 weeks out from my scheduled Left THR. I'm starting to get a bit anxious, but I am so ready for the constant pain to subside.
I am blessed to live in California and have excellent insurance. In today's mail I received appointment cards for March 6th for my 1st post-open x-rays and appointment with my Surgeon. It seemed a bit odd to mark those on the calendar when I haven't even had my surgery.
My biggest anxiety is allowing myself the necessary time for recuperation. After reading the many posts, it almost seems that it is best to keep our successes a bit quiet from everyone in our day- to-day life and share them here in the forum. My concern is that the expectations of constant improvement vs the minor setbacks/fatigue aren't worth it.
Any suggestions?

"At my 6 week check consultant told me i had t g which is why my limp is so bad . This was caused by years of compensating for bad hip . Hr said u needed intensive physio. That was 5 weeks ago and when I rang GP they had not bothered to refer to physio. I am 54 and have done all the exercises and joined the gym. I have now paid for a physio as I cannot wait any longer fearing ill never not have a limp. I have a very demanding job and pressure is on to return to work. The physio has put me on crutches now and I'm supposed to go back to work on Monday. I am now feeling very unconfident and mood is low. To maximise chances of regaining a good gait I feel I need at least another month of physio now its started privately. Do people think that physio now will pay dividends later and I should focus on getting as strong as I can before going back to work ? Can't see how i can do my job on crutches. Do others get a bit low once realisation sets in about having a new hip ? Came to this site as I am hopeful there maybe someone experiencing similar dilemmas to me

"I wonder how much practical guidance is given when people have THR. I was lucky to have a lot or to work out even more ideas. A lot of this is preparation beforehand,I can share some here:-
In the car  as a passeneger-
1. Tilt the seat back as much as possible, whilst you are getting in (bum first), to help preserve the right angle then return the seat to more comfortable position
2. Use a wedge shaped cushion preferably or any cushion to fill the drop at the back of the seat
3. Sit on a plastic bag to make it easier to pivot around.
Indoors
1.Whilst you sit or stand put the operated leg out in front
2. Increase the chair height with more cushions or an extra bit of chair seat foam which can go under the original seat.For the loo you need a raised toilet seat and at least one hand hold
3.Putting your crutches to one side turn them upside down which helps prevent them slipping over all the time
4.Going upstairs the good leg goes FIRST with the crutches
5.Have a grabber to hand for picking up items
6. In the kitchen if you cannot stand for long use an office type chair
but put the back against a cupboard whilst you get on otherwise it will move away from under you!
In the bedroom
1. How to get into bed ( will detai if necessary)
2.Getting dressed - the easy way to put on tight compression socks (for your helper)
3. Put the operated leg first into pants and trousers
4. Obtain velcro close shoes or elastic shoe laces if you are likely to have to do it alone
5.Use a long handled shoe horn
 Anymore ideas out there?

"Hello,
First post here...  I am 53 Male and had total hip replacement 6.5 weeks ago on right hip.   I have hip displaysia and moderate arthritus , but pain in right leg had gotten so bad I elected to have the surgery.  The surgery was the anterior approach, so recouperation has been great and the new hip feels very good.  However, starting about 3 weeks ago my other  hip started really hurting.  It is now so bad I can barely walk around.  
The right leg was 3/8 inch shorter than left - so when they did the surgery on the right  they lengthened the right side to make them equal.  I'm thinking this is what is causing the left side to hurt so much now.  The whole hip dynamic and weight distributin has changed.  I can't think of any other reason.  I have been riding the recumbant bike at the gym and that feels fine but I cant walk on the treadmill because of pain.  It is so bad now I cant stand more than a few minutes without the pain starting and I cant even walk out to the mailbox without a prominant limp and shooting pain throughout my left hip. Hip flexor is weak and the center of most of the pain.
I'm hoping to hear of others who experienced this.  Thanks!

"I have today attended at my Health Club to see a coach who specialises in exercise and rehabilitation.  I have a right anterior pelvic tilt.  Eg ""if you were to take two pieces of string, of equal length and place them onto a wire hanger that dipped to the right hand side. Although the string is of equal length, the string to the right hand side would appear longer"":I was hoping that the coach would give me some exercises to strengthen and correct.  However, she advised that any strengthening exercises, whilst the pelvis is tilted, would merely strengthen the tilt! Instead, she recommended that I a see a Chiropractor. Fortunately, I have a brilliant Chiro who has confirmed that he will be able to straighten my pelvis. In the meantime, whilst in a corridor, I was given exercises to help with balance. I had to walk forward,as if on a tightrope,one foot in front of the other, with good posture, and then walk backwards, again as if on a tightrope. Whilst still in the corridor, I was told to walk straight ahead but  on tiptoe forwards and backwards.  These exercises really need to be carried out in a corridor because, several times, I lost my balance and the wall prevented me from falling. I was also told that the only activity I could take in the pool was to walk forwards and then backwards. Again, this was for balance and not strenthening.
Of course, you need to carry out your physio in order to strengthen muscles. However, if like me, you have a pelvic tilt and your leg lengths are equal, do not progress, after twelve weeks, to the more demanding exercises. Get that tilt corrected first.
I have an appointment to see my Chiro next Tuesday and shall let you all know how I progress.
Whilst at the club, I saw several members who remarked on how well I looked and that the pain, that had dragged me down for so long, had finally, left my face.  A real booster!

"So I had my surgery Jan 4th 2017, I screwed up my last post and I keep wanting to put 2016. But I had a total right hip replacement, this surgery had been something else, between the pain medication causing crazy itching, to sleeping all the time, to the constipation, to the mucsle cramps and spasms. I finally was able to go off my pain medication. I finally no longer constipated. But I'm still having mucsle cramps and spasms. I been doing physical therapy which is not easy. I feel so weak and tried and my energy is gone. My appetite is finally better since getting over the constipation. I finding it hard to sleep asset night I can't get comfortable and the cramps and spasms do not help with this. I almost miss the pain medication, at least then I was sleeping. I also have been super emotional, like I cry at everything, is this normal? Also my knee on my operated leg has been really aching is this normal? I'm trying so hard, I know it take time but how long. Also since they did the anterior approach my leg feels weird when I try to walk i hope that goes away. I also noticed I get stiff, I hope that is normal!! I hope this surgery wasn't to much for me

"Hi all. I am 3 months post LTHR. I have been doing well apart from having very weak muscles in the left leg.
Today I have been getting really bad shooting pains In the same leg but just above the knee. It feels like someone is sticking a hot poker in there. It lasts a few seconds then goes, but comes back again 5 mins later.
Has anyone else experienced this. Or should I be worried?

"I happened to stumble upon this podcast the other day..
It's from the BBC radio 4 ""Inside Health"" programme from 11/09/2012 which can be found as a podcast on the I player radio App.
It gives a great insight into OA,claiming a joint replacement isn't always necessary,and the possibility of stem cell cartilage repair,which could become    possible in the next few years.
It also explains how arthritis isn't necessarily as formerly thought a wasting disease..
Well worth downloading.

"I have to admit that I was going to post a couple of days ago, and then I saw Morriewens post and couldn't! I felt so bad about her experience. Still do.
So, at nine weeks post op, I went back to work on Tuesday. It all went swimmingly. I'd been able to more or less keep up, so there wasn't a lot of catching up to do. My boss had been diligently telling everyone to not send me emails etc., while I was recovering. I told them the opposite, and most of them went with me! 
It was kind of weird because we had moved offices while I was off, so it felt like the first day at work - I had no idea where anything was. The only real hiccup was that, true to form, the special desk I needed ( mostly for the ankle) wasn't there after three months of our so-called access team messing about trying to work out what to do for the least money possible. A phone call to specialists resulted in a desk arriving on Friday, ordered directly by my boss. He's a gem!
So I was ""in the office"" or at meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, but with our weather forecast being dire  (not so bad as it turned out) I worked from home on Thursday and Friday. I have to admit that by Thursday I was tired, and the hip was a little achey at times. Not surprising because I hadn't tried to work flat out for 7+ hours in ten weeks! And I think it's mostly the ankle that is the problem - getting around is so hard with it.
But my boss is great. I can drive to the office, and after that, meetings in the city centre where I can't park easily are done by taxi. He's very flexible with working patterns, so if I have no meetings it's easy for me to work from home. And he understands that I need to protect my ankle as much as possible from another stress fracture whilst I wait for the surgery. Can't fault him on any of this.

"Hello, This THR thing I think will be a miracle once completely healed. I have a very positive outlook for after especially after I have suffered for so long.
It is quite fresh since I had it done Dec 28.. and was released home Dec 31st.
I try hard to keep my leg straight but that has proven very difficult. It has made me wonder will it stay sideways cause even walking it it feels a bit sideways but I'm also wondering if it's not jus swelling.
I went into this scared and crying so bad and the drs were phenomenal.. I had a spinal and also a long acting morphine injected into my spine.. coming out I felt wonderful and pretty much still do except yesterday. I think I spend too much time up.. sitting up and trying to walk around because once it was time to relax i had one hell of a time to get back into bed and get comfortable. There was alot of pressure and aching in my groin area and inner thigh muscle.
Today all in all I'm impressed cause I was able to get out of bed alone this morning for the most part. Yay progress!! I do keep a pillow under my leg and a rolled up towel under my knee and do foot pumps almost all day long.
Good luck to everyone! I'm sure I'll be here tonight. Right now I'm jus fresh and waking up so besides some back pain I'm ok.
Thank you

Needless to say, altho the ball does fit into the socket to a certain extent it does not seat in fully

"I have looked up as much as I possibly could find on THR and am wondering about some things I was reading: Apparently the new hip joint is NOT exactly the same as the original hip from what I understand. The bone around the socket has a small ""lip"" around it which apparently keeps the ball joint from popping out of place. The artificial joint does not have this ""lip"" and there is a danger of dislocation at wrong angle movements..... Why didn't they design the artificial hip in the same manner? I was always wondering about this. Does anybody know?

"Hi all,
Thank you for the warm welcome in my first post. Such great info and support.
Had my appt this morning with the surgeon doing my op and we have agreed to go spinal with sedation. He told me he has had some bizarre conversations through the screen with people who chose no sedation but I am definitely not going to be doing that! Don't want to distract him, lol!
Quick question: he has suggested because of my age (51) that I go with a ceramic hip (ball and socket). He tells me it's longer wearing. He did also say that there is a very very slim chance (1/500) of grinding/squeaking with both parts ceramic and could have a type of plastic socket if worried. He recommends going for both ceramic but ultimately my choice. Any thoughts gratefully received. Seems like a slim chance and want it to last as long as possible but the idea of having further surgery to rectify it down the line is s bit off-putting!!
Thank you!

"Really need some help!!!  Groin pain started in march left leg after playing 8 hours of volleyball.  Got so bad I sought out a orthepedic and MRI showed bilateral avascular Necrosis.  Sent to specialist who stated only thing to be done is THR, got second opinion and Dr. said the same.  I asked when I needed this as anti-inflammatory seemed to help alot.  THey said that is totally up to me.  I scheduled my surgery four months out which will take place in a little over the week.
The delema I'm having is that with so little time before surgery I assess my pain level which at this time is maybe a 3 out of 10. taking anti's three to four times a week.  My walk is good with minimal pain, been doing restorative yoga, and even lifting weights with my legs (no squatting of course).  I do not have any pain at rest, doesn't keep me up at night, doesn't affect work.  When they hurt I notice my gate widens, i hobble somewhat but doesn't slow me down much.  I've asked multiple physicians when i should get this done including my surgeon and they all say ""It's up to you"".  It seems like I have to electively decide to be cut.  I'm confused, with me doing well at this time is it the right time to undergo this procedure?

"I had a hip replacement over 5 years ago,  I've had pain since having it . I can walk a couple of hundred yards then the burning starts and the pain just builds up . The first year my consultant give me storoid injections which really helped ,he said it was not the joint but the muscle that was the problem. I had 3 injections that year then the next time I phoned he said he couldn't give me any more . I have just put up with it since and manage to keep working but I mentioned it to my doctor last November and he said to ask again as the consultant most likely meant I could only have 3 in a year. At check up in December the  nurse I saw said there was no reason for my pain and injections wouldn't help . I can't fly because after a hour and a half the pain starts no matter what I do stand walk around or any thing. I'm on tramadol slow release and paracetamol and have been for years . Sorry to be so long winded but I'm just hoping someone has some answers. My husband and I both loved walking but now I can't do it any more.

Great to have found this forum! I am having a TLHR on Feb 20th and starting to feel very nervous. Seems like such a big operation. Mind you am in all kinds of pain at the moment, all day and night even worse so will be nice to get my life back. Am 51, and turns out I was born with hip dysplasia. Started out feeling knee pain and only diagnosed recently with hip dysplasia. Bone on bone with cysts. Tried steroid injection and hylauranic acid injection neither worked sadly. Can only take ibuprofen and paracetamol as all the other pills seem to make me feel sick or weird so pain management is tough. As is looking after a 1 yr old Labrador!!
Anyway, been lurking for a while so thought I would come on and say hi. Anyone done the op with spinal and sedation instead of GA. just wondering what's going to be best for quick recovery. Having posterior approach.

"Hello, all.
I've been stalking this site and the discussion forums since just a few weeks before my surgery, but just took the step to set up my account today.
I am 45 years old and until 2015 my only chronic condition of any kind was mild asthma. I am (was?) a runner and was having significant left hip pain starting in early 2015. It took until July for me to find a good ortho doctor that finally diagnosed the issue - osteoarthritis that was already pretty bad on the left, but also progressing on the right side. He assured me that running did not cause this, that it was bad genetics.
Fast forward to July 2016. I had tried to keep running, but by then just couldn't, and at my check up with my ortho and seeing the significant deterioration even on the right side by then, he recommended I go forward with BTHR. The pain was bad enough by that point that I quickly agreed, but scheduled surgery out into December because of family plans we had throughout the fall.
So, my surgery was finally on December 13th. There were a few minor things before/during surgery (almost turned me away due to a low-grade fever the morning of surgery, low BP and heart rate during surgery), but I've really had an excellent recovery so far, up to today being day 8.
My surgeon uses the anterior approach, for which I'm grateful. As much as I knew they'd have me up on my feet the same day of surgery, it still amazes me that's possible with both hips being replaced. The first time on my feet was tough (falling BP, lightheaded, etc.), but from the second time on, I really did well. PT was great in the hospital, but I was determined to leave the day after surgery as promised if all went well. And I did! By the afternoon of day 1 post-op, I could navigate the hospital halls and even stairs with a walker.
Probably the only real problem since is that I have to take iron - almost needed a transfusion before I went home - and I've had trouble finding a version that agrees with me and isn't too hard on my stomach.
During my first PT after coming home (day 3 post-op), I was even allowed to try just using a cane and was given the ok to do that going forward. I have already been out shopping (yes, kind of crazy this close to Christmas), to see a movie, and out to eat. It helps that I had a friend come out to stay with me for a few days, have a very supportive husband, and my college age daughter is also home to help around the house.
At this point, I am trying to space out pain meds, and if possible move to taking OxyContin only at night. I am off work until my follow-up appointment on December 28th. I have a ""desk job"", so after that, I plan to work from home until I am cleared to drive.
I have met in person a few folks in their 50s who have gone through this for the same/similar reasons as I, but no one else my age or younger. So, I'm really interested to hear about others in their 40s, and especially how you've gotten along further out than I am now. Also any runners successfully running again?
Thank you all for being a resource for support and inspiration even before I finally decided to create an account and share my story!

"Happy new year all! So im currently 19 days post LTHR posterier approach and have a few questions regarding progress as I'm not seeing anyone until 7th Feb!
When's the right time to go down to no crutches? I'm managing at home with one crutch, is this about right?
When does the limp start going? With no crutches I'm walking like a primate and I'm really worried that I'm not where I should be.
If I go to my GP and give them a specific date I want my sick note to end will they do this? (I work in a school and half term is 13th Feb so want to go back after this!) I have 3 weeks left on my current sick note until 30th Jan. I'm a head of year so lots of running up and down stairs and chasing 13 year olds around a school packed to the brim!
Did everyone follow the '6 weeks sleeping on your back' rule? My heels, ankles and ass are killing me!
And finally...my leg seems at least 2-3 cms longer, will this die down in time?
Sorry for all the questions but you lot are my . saviours!! Xxx

"Well it's three months and starting phased return to work next weds . Still in some pain mainly groin and outer thigh and on meds and some pain at night . But getting better and have walked total of 2 miles in last two
Days .
Here's a tip for you tho ... despite lots of people saying they are pain free , for all those not - a lovely new doctor this morning told me is it a massive OP and he has attended some and to be in pain at 3 months is totally normal and it is still early
Days and it takes 6-12 months for you to really forget the hip and stop feeling that lump of alien metal in my hip experience .
Also , for those with groin pain my physio said really your hip is just hanging on by tendons after the groin disrupted so to
Concentrate on that groin muscle/s by any movement that raises your leg up with knee
Bending . So walk about and every step on your bad leg bring knee up and hold for 2 seconds then walk on . Also put a ball or cushion between your knees / ankles and squeeze together for 5 secs then release . You can do this in bed ... once that muscle is strengthened the pain will lessen.
Hope other 3 monthers doing well

"Just an update, I had my surgery the fourth of January. I was so nauseated when I got up to walk I almost threw up. I also could not empty my bladder all the way so they had to cathereize me twice, which it was no fun. I manage to eat a little pudding and a popsicle. The frist time i stood up i got really got and ringing in my ears i thought i was going to pass out. But my blood pressure kept bottoming out. So I couldn't get out of the hospital bed or receive any pain meds. I manage to do a lilt physical therapy. The second day was so much better, no nausea a little dizzy headed but nothing like the first day. They also were able to finally remove my oxygen and my drain tube. He also changed my bandage. Yesterday I was able to eat really good, and was able to do physical therapy. Despite me getting a low grade fever which was 99.4, they said that was normal. They discharged me and I have a follow up in three weeks. They warned me about hurting worse, they weren't joking. I feel like my pain is in the bone. But I feel like it is a different kind of pain then what I was having. The doctor told me that I had a lot of damage to my cartilage and I was had developed arthritis in that hip.so now I got a brand new hip. I hope the hard part is almost over.

I just skied for 3 days and felt no added pain. I stayed off the mogels most of the time. I did not want to fall too often. I did remove my ski on the operated leg to get up once... I did not trust the 90 degree break position I was in. THAT RULE IS NOT IN PLACE FOREVER IS IT? My most common sensation now is when i come out of a ""toe touching"" position; it feels often like my hip has a piston in it that releases as I stand upright. Hope all is great with your recovery.

"I had a THR in 2010 which though deemed a ""success"" by the surgeon, I did not feel the same way and have had discomfort on a daily basis ever since.  I do exercise e.g. walking, swimming, gym (no running but do cycle), exercises in the water e.g. swinging backwards and forwards, side to side and doing a ""figure of 8"" with leg. These past 2 weeks my leg has felt it will give way when stepping up the kerb, stairs etc with similar feeling of weakness in that knee and pain hip after a long walk.  Is the THR failing?  Have I exercised too much e.g. wrong exercises i.e. the ""figure of 8"" in the water?  I had an x-ray on knee of that leg 3 weeks ago and found mild athritis and another x-ray on hip which consultant said looked fine.  All I can think is that I have damaged the hip with too much or wrong exercise and the hip is now failing.  Ironically, if I do no exercise for more than a week, my hip becomes stiff and painful anyway.  Anyone with similar problems at all?  Off to GP tomorrow as now worried.

"hello fellow hipsters.......
has anyone had increased pain on the non operated hip side but further up around waist level, I think it is called sacro-iliac area where the base of the spine joins the top of the hip.
My 9 week old new hip is coming along well, still a bit achey and prickly sensation at night, but going well.
I think the pain in opposite side has to be from readjustment of leg length on THR side. The pain is sharp and mind altering when I sit down or stand up but ok on walking.
Im wondering if anyone has experienced this sort of pain higher up than the hip joint area in the opposite side?
happy healing to all x

"Hi everybody!
I haven't added to discussions lately but I do follow them.
Since I have OA in ALL of my joints except my knees, I've noticed that my lower back has become more painful and I am having back spasms which take my breath away when I get out of bed in the morning.
I went for my yearly exam and my Ortho said that the hip looks good
and is still in place.
He said the back spasms are not caused by the hip replacement. I won't go to see 'back' doctor because I know he'll tell me the OA in my back is worse and I refuse to have injections.
Has anybody noticed their OA pain has become more painful in other joints since their surgery?
I just feel like my overall body is in much more pain than before the surgery. I currently take 1 Vicodin and 1 Celebrex and 1 325mg Aspirin a day but the pain is still there. it eases it a little but doesn't take it away.
Any suggestions

"My dearest fellow hippies,
 I also want to wish you happy holidays 
I am on this forum for quite a long time, my profile shows 2 years, but it is about one and a half year...
This forum is part of my life and that is why you find me still responding 
 At the moment my life feels on hold... I am at a cross road  Had 2 THR surgeries 6 months apart and was all by myself with this whole process 
I left Los Angeles in June 2014 after 34 years and moved back to Holland where I grew up  was laid off at age 65 and found myself in a void not knowing what to do ..
Long story short: to my own surprise I found myself in a rural area in Holland ( I grew up under the smoke of Amsterdam)  meadows, heather fields, farms, cows , sheep and horses around me and living in a bungalow in the woods on a Bungalow park  pretty isolated ..
 In no time I had a GP, who send me to a regional hospital to get hips x-rayed and within months first hip replacement surgery took place  6 months later the 2nd one 
I have no idea what I am going to do next and so, every morning I come here on the forum 
 I have seen so many of you going from being on the fence, utterly scared, to coming out on the other side and most have gone on with their lives 
 You are so courageous, we all are  I am afraid that people around us, family and friends, cannot understand what we are going through.
We are left on our own, so to speak --- some of us go recover quicker than others... others have other challenges to cope with... it is all safe to talk about it here ..
 We are a diverse group of kindred spirits 
 May your light within continue to shine brightly and touch each and every person you meet in the coming year.
 With much love and a big warm hug

"So ...asked to see surgeon ASAP as still lots pain 12 weeks in plus one leg longer than the other . Pain meds 4 X daily and can't sleep for throbbing groin. Meeting went pretty much as expected ... X rayed my hip and said it was ' beautiful ' and 'perfect' and if he had to use an X Ray at a conference it would be mine .
Not if I came with you I replied ...
YOU wouldn't be allowed to speak ! He grinned back .
So pretty much my hip is A star top of the class . So why is it more painful than before? He measured legs and there is 1/2 difference . Was quite evasive as to whether that would cause pain but said it would be resolved he promised . So referring me to podiatry for shoe lift . He said there is a margin for error in
Leg length . Unlike last time I saw him when he said most people were pretty much pain free after the Op he now said it is ' early days ' (12 weeks) . It's all positive he said . Beautiful is not a word I would use to describe my hip pain I said and the former pain has been superseded by a worse one . Didn't really get any answers why and he agreed to my comment that nerve and tendon etc damage would not show on an X Ray . But no worries as he has done hundreds and mine is blinking marvellous ( apart from keg being longer and in awful pain ..)
I did hear another lady complaining in reception that hers was so painful too . Must have been the day of the rejects .
Don't get me wrong this guy has a hell of a job and is very nice and smiley and reassuring and positive . But he evaded my questions about returning to work , pain control and argued that naproxen is the same as Ibupropen when it is stronger . So I said what if this is the same in 6 months ? He evaded that too . Once the X Ray shows the job is done, and perfectly so in my case even tho I now 1/2 cm taller on bad leg , the surgeon has done his job . Yet I know on this forum all sorts of other muscular problems can arise that don't show on X Ray . I am thus trusting in his positivity and presuming that this is just early days and hoping that foot lift thingy will help . I asked him how long the referral would be and he didn't know . He said my other hip was fine . Did a lot of computer measuring and talking surgeon speak till I wearily asked ' what does that MEAN '? and he conceded there was a slight difference .
Do any fellow hipsters know if just 1/2 cm off could cause bad pain ? Thanks

I found it fascinating, and it makes a lot of sense. It doesn't change anything for hippies, but it might help be an answer to ""why"". There doesn't seem to be a lot of other sense - you can fall victim to joint problems whether you are fit or a coach potato, and blaming genes for OA doesn't really work either.... And I know that there is now a consensus that a number of spinal problems are a result of the fact that our spines haven't yet evolved fully for walking upright - if we had been designed to walk upright our spinal ought to be different!
Anyway - I thought it was interesting....

It really does take a while for your whole body to accept and adjust to your new hip. I think if you overdo it in the first couple of months, it catches up with you later on......problem is, we all feel so good we think we have it nailed in a couple of weeks

I have come away from the UK to new york for christmas with my family, on the flight I was in a lot of pain mainly just stiff pain, I did get up a few times to stretch my legs, but now I have woken up the next morning in a lot of pain, I have iced the thigh and taken a tramadol ( which is a shame because I hadnt taken them since the op) anyway I just want some reassurance that this is normal as I am feeling very anxious and dont want to ruin my familys holiday.
Thanks.
Sam

"Merry Christmas to everyone. Thanks for all the support you give to all. I have a question I'm hoping someone can help with. I have an old hip replacement to be replaced on Wednesday. It was cemented in which surprised my surgeon but I guess I'm looking at having the femur broken and the cement ""melted"". I know the recovery will be slower but has anyone else had this procedure. A little apprehensive about the immediate recovery
But truly looking forward to being on the other side, of the surgery, that is and recovering! Happy Holidays?

"I am now twelve weeks post op and returning to work on the 4th January,2017.  I am rather concerned that, whilst I now have new hips, my brain matter has become somewhat jaded. In any event, my profession is such that I shall have little time to visit this wonderful forum. In this regard, I wish to relay my thanks, to everyone who has assisted me with my two hip replacements, throughout this year.
I wish everyone a magical Christmas followed by a wonderful and pain free new year.
God Bless you all.

"Hi all. 
I was wondering how to manage my swelling. I'm 6 days post op. The swelling started in my thigh, from my hip and went down to my knee 4days post op. Then yesterday my knee and calf/shin started swelling today it's moved down to my ankle. To be honest I don't think my thigh is anywhere as swollen as it was today. My swelling is not particularly painful, red or hot so I'm unconcerned about DVT. It's just feels very tight and it's driving me mad! I have been elevating my leg and using an ice pack but this doesn't seem to be helping much. Any advise regarding this problem would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Joy.x

Spending most of my time alternating from resting in bed to getting up, doing my exercises and walking around my bungalow. All of this I can manage. My problem is I feel sick so am off my food. Had anti sickness tablets whilst in hospital. But they didn't give me any to bring home. Anyone else had this problem? I'm in the uk so if anyone could recommend an over the counter med I could buy to help with this prob, it would be much appreciated. Thank you

"1. Find an experienced surgeon  Your orthopaedic surgeon will become an important person in your life for years to come.
2. Educate yourself about your surgery  Learn as much as possible about pre-op preparations, the procedure, post-op care, 
& post complications.
3. Seek a second opinion  Your surgeon should honor your right to confer with another, well-respected orthopedist if you have any doubts.revision surgery in more complicated that primary THR.
4. Plan ahead  Schedule surgery when you can afford to take time off from work, and when it will be least disruptive to your family.OR PLAN FOR SUBACUTE CONVALENCE. visit them ahead of surgery.
5.Reconcile the big picture in your mind so you don稚 go into surgery dwelling on risks or potential complications. with revision the femur device must be removed from the femur.
6. Have a positive attitude  Be encouraged and focus on the high rate of success for Thr revision procedures and understand that revision takes longer to recover. 
7. Talk with past the staff be familiar with what is required after the revision. 
8. Visualize getting your life back  The pain and deterioration of your joint severely diminished your quality of life. Think about how much things can improve after surgery.
9. Realize feeling tense or anxious is normal  Don稚 fight it! Listen to music while recovering .
10. Actively participate  Make a commitment to do your part to ensure a positive outcome and assume responsibility for your own care (, follow precautions, do exercises daily, etc.). Consult with your orthopaedic surgeon with questions or concerns anytime.
11. Practice on crutches , walkers  If you have spent time on crutches before, reacquaint yourself with them so the awkwardness won稚 be overwhelming after surgery.
12. Don稚 view the recovery process as time lost  This is time to rest and recuperate. Time invested in rehabilitation is necessary for better health.
13. Prioritize physical therapy  Realize your physical therapy and post-op exercise regimen are critical for a successful outcome. Think of each exercise as a stepping-stone toward improved strength, range of motion and function.
14. Prepare for downtime Remember you will be laid up for about 6 -12 weeks. Organize, schedule appointments and take care of as much business as possible before surgery.
15. Adapt your environment  Get ready for homecoming before you go to the hospital by having a raised toilet seat, reachers and other adaptive equipment already available.
16. Be conscious of infection  If you have any sign of any kind of infection anywhere in your body you must postpone surgery.
17. Donate autologous units of blood  You can donate your own blood in the weeks prior to surgery to be held for your operation. Also donate bone and blood .
18. Ask about current medications  Find out if you need to stop taking any prescription, over-the-counter or herbal remedies before surgery at the pre op meeting.
19. Arrange for help  Plan for someone to be with you, especially for the first week or two at home. If no one is available, make arrangements to enter a post-op inpatient rehabilitation facility until you are independent enough to care for yourself at home.
20. Take multi-vitamins and eat well-balanced meals  Be particularly health conscious during the weeks and months leading up to surgery to promote better healing.

I had an amazing resume, glowing references and a terrific interview. 
But then the guy go to thinking over the weekend and decided to call another of my references. Mental alarms sounded. Sure enough, the reference alerted me last night to the fact that potential boss is concerned I might be ""too needy"" for his small team, just because he knows I had a broken hip last December (I had to explain a 6-month gap on the resume). My reference said he reassured him that was not the case, but I think my hip has cost me the job...

"So that's it for me. I'm six weeks post op. Surgeon chucked me out because I was doing too well at two weeks. Now physio at the hospital has chucked me out too. And now I can drive. It's a really odd feeling, as in ""so that's it?"". I was expecting more! Pain... Trying to get the new hip to work... Or something.... But in actual fact it's like I woke up with my old hip - the one before the arthritis and osteonecrosis- and the one they took away was an imposter! 
So the only c**p thing now is the ankle, which of course is holding back my mobility by miles. So, obviously I have to take my own advice - keep up the exercises, and up the ante by getting back to more yoga. And make sure that my hip continues in this direction. Whilst beginning to plan my next campaign, to recover from ankle surgery just as well. When it comes. And manage having my life whilst I wait for it.
So I have a list - actually a very short one - of extra equipment I will need to cope with the 12 weeks of non/ partial weight bearing. Then start practising new exercises with my own physio to prepare the muscles and tendons for major surgery. And practice with the equipment, so that by the time I have to rely on it I am comfortable and confident.
Finally, I have just had to accept that walking longer distances isn't going to happen and I can't throw away the crutches. I can get around indoors with a stick or one crutch - and increasingly, with nothing. In fact I have managed to lose my stick a few times, because I put it leaning against something and walked away without it and didn't even notice! But outside where surfaces are more uneven and unpredictable.... Well that is having to stay with crutches.
I splashed out and bought myself a reconditioned all terrain scooter, which is really for my dog - as in being able to give him all the exercise he needs for the next year until I am back on my own feet. So if you happen to be walking, and see a white haired lady being ggleefully chased by a blue merle border collie, that'll be us.
Obviously, I'm not out of the woods with the hip. There's still a lot of work to be done, and it's still possible for something to go wrong, but I'm not focusing on anything except building my strength and staying positive.

"Hi Hippies....I have another post please.  Well, I got my first surgery date (Feb 9) for my first hip (I'm bone on bone on both hips so I'm praying I get thru this one well enough to conquer the 2nd) but I'd be lying if I didn't say I am scared scared scared.  However, I've come to the end of my rope with suffering thru the stiffness, pain and inability to move.  My question is...have any of you tried the treatment of your OWN PRP (Platlet Rich Plasma) or Stem Cells?  I'm in the LA area and here the talk program every weekend, but my Ortho Surgeon says 'that doesn't work'.  But I have to tell you, The Dr. on the program (and yes, I know he's selling his business, but) sure makes a good case for wanting to try this.  Anyone out there had personal experience with trying this treatment?  I'd appreciate any feedback from you hippies who know what I'm referring to, especially if you have tried it.  Thank you, blessings and healing to you all.

"I am now almost 4 months post-op THR.
A few weeks ago I found that when walking longer distances I still needed the cane a bit but it started feeling cumbersome. I still needed it a bit but now it felt heavy and too much.
Now I have switched to walking/ hiking poles. I believe they call them Nordic walking poles. It's been so great!
The poles keep me balanced on both sides and are very light. My posture is better because I balance centrally now instead of to a cane on one side. The poles make you walk faster and give your arms a light workout too.
This is exactly what I needed to rebuild my stamina and confidence for walking longer distances. Plus it's fun if you can get over feeling silly at the beginning!

"Good evening all,
I am 34 years old, I got injured at work five and a half years ago. During this time being injured I underwent three hip arthroscopy procedures, the most recent I sought the specialist skills of Mr Richard Villar (awesome fella). Unfortunately none of the procedures were successfully in rectifying all my symptoms, as such I found myself requiring further more dramatic intervention.
I have two children under the age of 7 and as such struggled to be the fully hands on dad, with rough and tumble with my boys. In turn, the barriers have caused me some psychological issues making me hard to live with for my wife.
On Monday 12th December 2016 I underwent the full hip replacement (ceramic on ceramic). Within hours post op I was on my feet going for my first walk with the aid of a Zimmer frame.
I'm now 6 days post op and I am able to walk with crutches (for stability) around my local streets, strengthening the muscles and keeping mobile. The pain is isolated to the operation site and the muscles that contain the swelling, along with masses of bruising.
I feel a new person and I have the drive to know the hard work begins now. However, I honestly believe that the success thus far is down to the pre-operative isolated exercises to strengthen the muscles groups that are affected during the procedure. Simple exercises with resistance built up over a three month period set me up to be in the best possible position to endure the procedure.
My only regret is that I didn't go for the replacement earlier so that I could enjoy my life, and my family.
If you are young and/or in a similar position as I found myself, please think of the benefits to the replacement and the life that you once had prior to the issues. You can get those days back. Hopefully by the time a revision will be required, technology will have moved on. Remember life is for living and we only have one to live.

"Hello! This is my first posting, although I've been using this site as a resource for a few weeks. I am 43 and just had a left THR in order to prepare for a future right TKR (congenital structural abnormalities are driving these procedures - my knee has dislocated since I was 7).
Here's the scoop - I'm looking for any feedback!
- It seems like my recovery is slow - I'm still using 2 crutches, primarily outside (it is winter, and my right knee dislocates, so while I'm cautious I also need them). I walk without them inside the house but my limp is so bad that I can't walk with good posture, strong core.
- I have been having lower back muscle spasms (right side, opposition of surgical side) the past 2 days, leaving me immobile and in more pain than I can describe. Is this all related? When do I determine this is not normal and go in l? I'm using my post-op pain meds, Dilaudid, which I had been off for 3 weeks (the weaning period caused horrendous side effects).
- I went back to work 2 weeks post-op and I've been struggling to focus or stay engaged ever since. Has that happened to others? I feel like I can be productive for 3 hours max and then I'm disinterested, can't focus or exhausted (since I run my department and its end of year craziness, this is kind of bad!).
I would love any input!

"Hello All,
I'm Helen. A 37 year old Zumba instructor who's life and career was put on hold after being plagued with injury for over 2 years. To cut a long and labourious story short, mis-diagnosis and a birth defect had lead me to the road of a total hip replacement to my right hip.
I am now post op by 7 days and it's not been that bad in the grams scheme of things. My leg feels heavy, like it's been detached, beaten up badly and re-attached. I'm walking fine with my crutches Albeit slowly.
I wanted to see how others felt about the rehabilitation exercises.
I have only been given 3 lots to do in during the next 6 weeks. Leg raises to the side (each leg) leg raises to the back (each leg) and bringing the knee forward like an exaggerated March motion ( again each leg) .
This is fine when working operated leg. I can manage 15+ but when standing on the operated leg, Geeze I just can't do it without holding on for deal life!!! Is this normal. Weigh bearing on the operated leg feels dead weird. I feel like I can't stand up straight, it clicks and pings inside. Is this normal?
Also if I am lying on the bed with my knees bent and I do some glute stretches, I can feel this deep clicking again. It's enough to turn my stomach. Like an elastic band inside my groin!
Any help info and advise is welcome.
I also have 2 small children who are finding it hard having their mummy incopasiteted. But I just need to remember the pain I was in before and this is only a small amount of time in the grand scheme of things.
Will I ever get back to Zumba teaching? This is a million dollar question. I want to preserve my hip but I don't want to compromise it's lifespan.
Thanks Ladies and Gents.

"While having my first post op with my doc he said i cant fall ever again in life fall and this is alarming because i am clumsy...like my first broken bone was at 8 yrs old so being only 29 i know i have atleast a few more good falls in me so now i am terrified to do anything. Before the car accident that fracture my hip..i was a very adventurous person...and the reason why i was pushing myself so hard during my recovery was so i could possibly somewhat return to that type of lifestyle. Is it true i probably wont be able to none of that again?

"Wooopeee! i'm finally back behind the wheel of my cherished Mini 6 weeks post LTHR! 
I got the all clear from my physio on Thursday & went out with hubby for 1st trip but all great, pleased i haven't lost my confidence & no discomfort with the gears apart from soreness along the scar. 
It's great to have that freedom again but i must admit i've enjoyed the extra walking ive had to do & the lovely people i've met on walks, buses etc. i must keep up daily walks!
Good luck & encouragement to anyone starting out, its worth all the effort with exercise & regular resting too.

"My journey had been a long one with my right hip. I don't know the exact point I hurt it, but in 2001 I was in a car accident and another one in 2007 and a snowboarding incident in 2010 that all contributed to the way my hip is today. I went through hip injections, foam rolling, pain meds, pain patches, tens unit. Doctor after doctor. I was still running too, at the time. I finally gave up for awhile, but in 2013 the pain became so unbearable that I went one last time to a different doctor finally I found I had dysplasia (shallow socket). I had my first hip surgery in 2015 for a labral tear and femoral impingement. I thought to myself this is it I can finally get back to my life. I was dead wrong. My hip was worse, my hip buckles, it catches, pinches, felling like it is coming out of place and it pops all the time. In constant pain I went back to the doctor. Now a year later I'm getting a hip replacement on the 4th of January and I am scared to death. There going in anterior approach. The liner will be polyerathanie and the ball will be ceramic. I will be in the hospital for one to two days. On a walker for 5 days and came for 5 to 8 days. I hope this gives me my life back, I hope it does not make it worse. I hope I'm doing the right thing. Feeling nervous.

I don't eat much, I'm sure the lost of appetite is from the pain meds.  I try to do my exercises 1-2/ day.  I'm not ready to stop the pain meds because I still have a lot of pain. Besides the pain meds, I'm also on a muscle relaxer, and a medication for nerves (neurontin)

"Hi, I just had a THR 10 days ago. I think things are going ok but I just wanted to see if I'm doing ok or meeting the right milestones etc. I don't have a massive amount of pain, and I found that the NSAIDS were raising my bp so I cut them. Was this the right thing? I'm still taking normal/light painkillers, though I'm worried now about the anti-flammatory aspect. The thing is, how do I know there's inflammation? I do have swelling and bruising. The incisision site and around feels a little hard and tender but definitely not sore, so I think it's ok. 
The only pain I ever feel is when I go from sitting/lying to standing, for about 4 seconds, I get an ache all the way down my leg, which then stops. 
Another thing is I've been waking up with a slight headache every morning that usually goes as I get up. I'm thinking this is because of the stiff position on my back. Did anyone get this?
How much walking did you hippies do in the aftermath? I feel I could be doing more than I'm doing (which is 100m or so daily). Is this advisable?
Thanks for the advice!

"I can't believe it's been 2 weeks since my R THR.  Let me tell you it has been an emotional rollercoaster.  I had issues with low BP which caused me to have dizziness, I don't sleep well, I'm not eating much, I have lots of fluid, and my leg is so swollen that I can't wear my normal pants.  I've had good days and bad days.  This past Monday, I had my PO appointment with my doctor.  He said my hip looks great, and he told me I can start OPPT.  Today was the last vist with the Home PT.  I start OP PT tomorrow.  
My therapist told me today that I have really progressed well.  She told me that the good and bad days will happen, I will still continue to have emotional days, the dizziness will continue because of the BP, I will still have some loss of appetite, and I will still have the swelling and fluid.  However, she told me that it well all get better.  She said that I need to focus on good, and know that it will all go away and I will get back to normal.  
I know that it is difficult for me to see the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but I have to try.  I know I will have emotional days.  I know it is a rough ride, but I know I can do it because of all of you on this disscusion board.  You have all showed me it can be done. So, thank you all for sharing and caring.

Mum is relatively fit ie no previous strokes or heart attacks,still drives etc but  I don't think she'll be able to have a spinal anaesthetic because of her lower back problems, so we're talking a GA which carries more risks and means she'll have to have strong pain killers(opiates) afterwards, which isn't ideal for older people. Seems like a lot of stuff to remember afterwards and she does have some memory problems, and is prone to spinning around like a top and has some balance problems. Dad is 85 and Mum does everything in the house. They don't have a loo downstairs and have their shower over the bath. So worried, Trying to stay positive but as an ex nurse it's difficult.

Ive finally tackled which meds work and which dont so pain is no longer an issue which is something i have to be careful with. Since pain isnt an issue i have to keep reminding myself im still not out of the woods yets..for instance i accidentally laid on my side..i crossed my legs..but who could blame me..it was the little things i wass missing..however i was wondering if anyone else has experience swelling and like this popping noise with every step you take. It doesnt hurt, its just uncomfortable. I text my doctor immediately and he told me not to worry about it. Its just the break down of soft tissue and scar formation...but since i know absolutely nothing about the human body and its anatomy...any other suggestions or does that sound about right

"Something definately not looking forward to!!  Having op Monday
Have been reading the forums for the past few weeks but still have so many questions/fears/concerns
Although my consultant has been good explaining procedure not a lot of info for afterwards.
Have end stage oseoarthritis and didn't even realise until beginning of this year when hip became very stiff.  Saw osteopath and he sorted out stiffness but said my not much rotation in left leg.  Had some pain then when stiffness went.  Still managed to do lots of walking in alps  with help iboprofen gel!  Went to get it checked out with a consultant and was told that the problem was bone on bone!  Has never been that painful as pelvis twisted back to compensate problem.  However last few months could feel back become a big problem.  Felt like something wrong with whole frame.  Also right hip that has mild arthritis is starting to play up.  Decided to try to stop more problems must go ahead.
Saw osteopath again yesterday. Wish had been before! He gently did a move and spine did a loud click but frame seems so much better today.  Still have a twist in pelvis if do a low squat and mild discomfort.
However am concerned if hip joint colapses so suppose op is the best option while still fit.  I am 62.
Have obviously had pre -op assessment and was said not to do anything for at least 3 months. Cooking , cleaning, even lifting a kettle!  Oh my!
Is it really as bad as this?  Will I always feel have something foreign in my leg or will one day I feel normal again?
Are the restrictions as bad as what I was told?
Would love to hear your views and comments
Would love to hear what you all say as I join the hippie club!

"Hey hippies, after 14 months of agonising stress with surgeons and hospitals they finally gave me new hip just in time for Christmas.
I have ceramic ball and plastic socket with posterior approach. Since I woke up I have done nothing but throw up, including my pain meds, so the first 24 hours were pretty horrendous and beyond painful. I am on day 3, still throwing up, but managing to keep some medication down, although I have never been so dehydrated in my life!
A question for you, is it normal to feel quite an intense cramping or pulling pain right inside the hip at the joint if you lift your leg or move to the side? Im guessing it might be the muscle that was cut but im terrified of damaging myself!

"I'm new here, I joined because I need some advice. I'm currently 32 years old. I had my left THR when I was 12 years old due to a slipped epiphysis and avascular necrosis. I've always been overweight AND active. I spend a good portion of my day at work on my feet. Because of my lifestyle, I'm on my way to needing my right knee replaced too. My hip has been causing me more pain over the last 5 years or so. I've been told I need a part replaced but because it's so old and I was so young, they will probably just replace the whole thing again. I was told to hold on as long as I could until the pain effected my quality of life then go in for surgery again. It can only been done so many times and because of my age they want me to wait. As of now I have way more good days then bad and the pain that comes and goes isn't excruciating.
My problem is, I'm here at Disney world right now. Walking many miles a day and standing for long period of time is inevitable. Today is day 5 and up until now my knee has hurt but not my hip. This evening though my hip hurt so bad I was in tears and my boyfriend who uses a scooter (two ""dislocated"" knees) offered me his scooter because I couldn't walk anymore. We are here for another 5 days, I'm hoping it was just a bad day and I'll be fine tomorrow but he thinks I should rent a scooter for the rest of the trip. When my hip doesn't hurt, I can walk fine. I would feel like I'm taking advantage by using a scooter. But the consensus is, it was the constant walking that caused my hip to hurt so much and it's only going to get worse if I keep pushing it.
How do others with hip replacements do Disney? I can't imagine that everyone with a hip replacement uses a scooter. How long does a typical hip replacement last before having to do it again? Will they do my hip and knee at the same time?
Thanks in advance.

"hi guys well my thrp op went threw dipite me having a cold on tuesday 6th dec 2016 it was totally different from the trhr i had had on the 23rd of september 2016 firstly when i had then spinal it took ages to work and then after postioning me i was sedated the next thing i knew i was awake and i could hear what sounded like drilling i said to then i m awake i dont want to be they said id started coughing and my breathing was being affected it was scary then i felt the pull as they put the staples in and looked up at the machines above me to see theartre staff wiping the blood of off the lights etc, i was then taken to recovery to be told there were no beds so myself along with 3 other people had to wait in recovery for 6 hours for a bed to found during which time i was not allowed to get up or have the wdge removed from betweem my legs im on the enhanced recovery and at each meeting we were told to get up and to ask for the wedge to be removed after 2 hours anyway after 3 hours they got the surgeon for me who allowed them to remove the wedge but as the nursing staff in surgeryf are not part of enhanced recovery team they were unable to do get us up etc, Finally i was put on a ward but as it wasnt the orthpedic ward due to no beds i was put in a side room to avoid infection and barrier nursed. My medication was all over the place in 24 hours i was given a mixture of oxicodeine oramorth gabepentin naproxin papracetemol liquid oxicodeine all at rather strange intervals and i was constantly in pain the next mornig the enhabced recovery nurse came round and went mad she said i should have have breakthrew meds every 2 hours if needed and shouldnt have been having to put up with pain she adjusted the medication and by day 2 i could finally stand up as the pain was preventing me doing this. I asked then on several occasions for break through meds and on one occasion had to wait 6 hours it was awful a male nurse on the ward actually put in a complaint on my behalf . Then on day 3post op in the evening i was moved to the orthopedic ward as a bed became available and again meds were changed no gabapentin just the other stuff day 4 which was yesterday i came home thankfully im gutted it was like this as last time the care i was given was brilliant but seems this time it got totally messed up. at least its over now im walking a little bit on crutches but am struggling due to still being under hip precatutions for my right hip but im sure i will get there xx

"Hi, I'm after some advice. I had a total left hip replacement, porcelain on ceramic in 2002 and they put my hip in at a slight angle, which put my knee slightly facing inwards, it wasn't a problem as it wasn't painful, but I had very little movement as in I couldn't bring my left foot up to my right knee. I had the same hip revised in may 2016, 7 months ago. I asked this em if they could straighten the knee and he said yes he could rotate the hip to bring the knee straight. When I come out of surgery my knee was extremely swollen, very painful and facing the right knee like it had been rotating the wrong way. The anaesthetist asured me it would get better. 7 months later, hip all good but knee is still looking deformed, extremely painful and swollen. I've since had an x-ray on my knee and there is no sign of arthritis and I had no problem with the knee before.

"I have just wished my physio goodbye but before he left, I needed to ask him a question.  Prior to my hip replacement, I would,whilst walking and without warning, fall to the ground. It would appear as if I had no limb. The falls were frequent and without the automatic instinct to save myself. It was explained, that the receptors to the brain that instruct our legs to move and walk, are contained within the synovial fluid of the hip. When suffering from osteoarhritis, some of the synovial fluid is missing and therefore, at times, the brain does not receive the signal, which, in turn, results in a sudden and unexpected fall. So my questions was ""now that I have artifical hips with no synovial fluid. What is it that signals my brain to walk""? The answer is ""Your brain, to walk, now uses your thigh muscles"". To test if these are strong, I was asked to close my eyes and bend at the knee. If you wobble, then they need strengthening. This is why the initial exercises, that focus on the muscles within the thigh, are so very important. Not only do they need to strengthen to hold the prosthesis in place, but also to send receptors to your brain to walk. I was also advised to walk, indoors, barefoot; to ensure that I walk slowly, heel to toe. Because I am now re-training my brain to use my thigh muscles and it needs to learn how to do it correctly.
So keep working on those thigh muscles and me? I'm going for a well deserved nap!

"I had my RHTP 8 days ago.  I feel awful.  I have pain in my pelvic area, my incision area, and my knee area.  The pain sometimes radaites done my leg as well.  It doesn't always hurt at the same time.  It depends on what I'm doing.  I feel the knee pain can be most bothersome especially when I'm standing up.    It tends to be much worse in the evening, especially on the days of PT.  It's so hard to explain.  I just didn't expect to still be feeling this level of pain.  
I push through the exercies, and my PT is good with my progression.  I'm suppose to do them 3 times per day, but on the days of PT the pain level is beyond a level of 10, so I can't do all of them.  
Besides the pain, I'm having issues with dizziness and nausea.  I normally have low BP, so it has at times dropped lower than my normal which I know contributes to the dizziness.  I'm also having trouble with muscle twitiching,  shakiness, loss of appetite, and I look pale.  
Is this normal?  I just really felt that I would be feeling better by now.

"hello folks,
first want to thank you all for the encouraging info and tips that get posted.  Truly a great community.
i have been advised to do a hip arthroscopy by one orthopedic surgeon, buy a second suggested that an anterior hip replacement would be appropriate. 
By MRI I have a torn labrum, tears in the gluts, trochNteric bursitis, femoral cysts.  Few other things.  Have had physical therapy, which was torture but was stopped after the MRI results.  I had bursa injections, injection into the joint under fluoro.
from what I read elsewhere the recovery from a hip arthroscopy is crutches 6 plus weeks, and lengthy physical therapy after but the Anterior replacement is a simpler recovery.  Also it appears that the anterior approach probably in not possible after an arthroscopy.
I am an active 69 and having spent the last 18 months dealing with 4 surgeries from a rotator cuff repair, I can't fathom spending the better part of another year recovering from a procedure that I still will need a replacement in a few years when I'm older and in maybe not so great shape. I just want to be done with this hippain and lack of mobility.
I'm looking for any information or suggestions or advice from our hippy family that will help me make the right decision. Thank you all

Finally got surgery its the best thing I ever did the recover is by no means easy but if you eat well do your excercises and get mobile you will get there.
6 weeks in im like a ray of sunshine in my life not a Cloud in sight.

Ive been doctors and my bloods are ok but all he has advised is anti inflam and painkillers.
Shouldn i be pushing to see a specalist? Looking online they say it is better to catch it early on but the doctor didnt seem concerned at all or even examine me!
Tried talking to my partner but dont think she is excepting that I have any issues and tells me to go ba k to the doctors as they must have got it wrong.
Really not feeling the best at moment and low is an understatement.

"Hello everyone , Its me again ;-). I was just wondering lately what are the long term hip restrictions ?   I know there is plenty of them for the first 3 months after the op , but whats after ? I thought that i can do everything apart from running- but i wasnt told anything else ? Is that true ? Did your consultant said anything else ? I am a little bit confused because when reading other hip forums i have found out that people where told more things that they need to be aware of - like bending, twisting etc. Can anyone help Please ? I think that because i was pain free for the 3 Years after pre op i wasnt really thinking about any restrictions :-( i just felt like i have a normal hip.

"My husband had been my care giver for a long time. 3 surgeries in 6 years. He has had to see/do things no husband should ever have to. I am 6 weeks out and still can't do much. He has had to take over everything. He goes from the time he gets up until he goes to bed. I have to say the house runs and looks better then it ever did when I was in charge. I feel our marriage going away. We have more of a care taker/patient. I haven't wanted nor felt up to intimacy. Anyone else go through this and what do you do? I love my husband we have been married 30 years. I don't want to lose this and I am tired of feeling guilty because he does everything.

"Today, for the first time in many years, I was able to go Christmas shopping with my beautiful daughter. We walked and chatted, just as we used to. We tried all the expensive perfumes and left the store smelling like a couple of ""high class hookers""! We had our make up professionally applied with Lancme products which, of course, promoted a much deserved purchase of their eye shadows along with some added essential extras. I was going to have my ears pieced again. I quite fancied two studs in each ear, but my daughter, outraged, relayed that should I contemplate surgery of any description, after two hip replacements, this year, I could find another carer and possibly another daughter . I thought, at this stage, it was probably best not to mention my anticipated op for a hammer toe!
Not only is it incredible; it is quite implausible , that this time last year I was totally crippled; unable to walk and in inexorable agonising pain. My last op was just nine and a half weeks ago. Yes I'm shattered but also uplifted and I shall probably sleep very well indeed!
Now what to do about this wretched toe?

"Hiya, its been a while since i posted. I had my left hip replaced 3 and a half weeks ago and recovery this time has been unremarkable really. Much quicker without the inch and a half leg length discrepancy that hampered recovery after the right hip. Exercises are being restricted by an inflamed tendon in my groin but thats about it. The biggest issue i have is tachycardia. I got it post op last time but much less so. pulse was typically 90-100 and it settled after a couple of weeks. This time I was kept awake ALL night by the bloody machine beeping every 5 minutes because my pulse was 110-120. At the time we put it down to the spinal failing before i came out of sedation so i came round to intense pain in my hip causing some quite severe pain issues for the first 24 hours. Day 2 it was up to 130 but dropped when one of my pain meds was reduced. However the tachycardia is still being troublesome 3 weeks later. Im 44 and not normally tachycardic. Im hypothyroid so tend to be a bit sloth like. 
I know its an odd one but i wondered if anyone else experienced anything like it

im seven weeks in and my back has been killing me. Phoned the Dr and they referred me to occupational health. Been today and it's what I said from the beginning. My op leg is longer than my right. Not by much but I new and I could feel it was not right. So now I have been refuted to physio to try and help with the problem and also need a insole to lift my right leg. This is why it's taking longer to heal as because I can not straighten my left leg properly so physio will help with different exercises to stengthen my op leg. X

"Hi fellow Hippies,
Like all of us, the dread after surgery, is dislocation. I don't mind admitting that the thought terrifies me. And yet, I have read many posts where this has occurred. I am now nine weeks post op and, becoming somewhat complacent. This morning my daughter brought her eight week old puppy to meet me and without thinking, I bent down to pick her up. (The puppy, not my daughter). I immediately felt a pull in my thigh and pain in my groin. Thereafter, my groin felt inflamed. It's settling now but it frightened me. Could anyone who has suffered dislocation explain what they did, if anything to cause it and what were the immediate symptoms ?
Many thanks

"it has been four weeks today, but I am still on two sticks. Struggling with back pain. I had my right hip done a year gone June and then my left was on the 14th of oct and I feel my left leg is longer than my right. Spoke to the nurse when she took my staples out and she said it is because my leg was still swollen and it will settle. I think this is why I am still on two sticks and my left leg still has not settled. Can not go for walks this time as the weather here is shocking and can not take the risk incase I fall, so I am taking trips up and down stares and holding onto the benches in the kitchen while I tidy up. So I and getting about. I so wish this was all over and I was back to work because I am getting so depressed stirring here on my own all day not even been able to take a walk around the block.

Any one else experience this??
Also I still feel that my right leg ( operative leg) does twist out slightly,when I stand and make it face perfectly  the front it feels slightly like I am standing pigeon toed but when I look down I am not . 
The Physio on day 2 at the hospital said it would sort itself out as soon as I get up walking ,but it hasn't.
Any ideas anyone???
i have my 8 week post op check with specialist next week so hope he doesn't say it needs sorting . 
Looking forward to hear from anyone.

"So I returned to the hospital yesterday as my arthritis pain has been continual most of this year. I had been told when initially diagnosed 3 years ago that I would need a THR at some point but they wanted to delay it until I was 50. This year I've felt it's detetiorated a lot and have had to give up the gym (pain still the same though). Saw consultant again yesterday who spent first 15 mins trying to put me off however my gp has put me on pain meds (2tramodol, 2 naproxen & 2 paracetamol at night which should knock out a horse but doesn't touch my pain for more than an hour at best). My concern was that if I'm on that much high dosage pain meds now what am I looking at taking over next 4 years. Anyway had the obligatory xray at which point he just said THR was only option as it had deteriorated so badly. Great I thought, let's do this, get my life and fitness back. Now a day later my head is buzzing with doubts and questions and I'm driving myself mental with research! Would rather hear from people who have had it done. I'm a single parent- 2 kids 18 and 13 at home, I do everything including working full time which is not salaried, I cannot afford to take 3 months off (also mentally this would do me in) so if I'm up and about would I be able to go back to work (I sit down all day not a manual job) after 2 weeks? How much ""looking after"" will I actually need on returning from hospital? (I'm an independent bugger and hate asking for help of any kind). My kids are at school and college and my 2 older ones work and dont live at home so I feel like I'm pretty stuffed. Am I ok to rest then just get up to make a brew or a butty? I've read stuff that says you can never cross your legs again? How is this possible if it's habit? I'm scared of what will happen if I can't bring in a wage plus I love my job!! Head is spinning sorry for all the questions- I know it needs doing but practicalities are scary!

"Hi all.
I went to see my surgeon today for the first time since my LTHR. I was a bit concerned that my left leg was still shorter because I do still limp without a crutch. He measured me and my legs are both the same length. He said I still limp because I was one of the more complicated patients, they had to remove a whole peice of muscle to get to my hip, then put it back so this is why I limp as the muscle is still very very weak. I also have fluid around the cartalige in my right hip but they will drain it al some point. It is very reassuring that my op went well. I just need to strengthen my thigh muscles to stop the limping.
He said I only have a 2% chance of dislocation and can bend more than 90 degrees if I want
Feeling more positive now.

"Hello hippies.
This may be completely unrelated to my op but I feel really under the weather at the moment and have done for a few days. Lightheaded is the main symptom (not all the time) and just so tired!
Because I recovered very quickly at first -was literally walking normally without even a stick at 3 weeks, going up and down stairs normally etc - I think I may have overdone it slightly last week. Is it likely this slightly unwell feeling is exhaustion? It doesn't feel like I did that much! I did go back to my work for half a day and went on public transport a few times that also involved a fair bit of walking. I guess I already know the answer but it's do difficult to sort out what might be to do with the surgery and something unrelated.
Hope you're all recovering well.

"l had my first appointment with the ankle consultant this morning. And I was actually expecting it to be bad news, just not this bad. There is only one thing he can do for it, something called a Bigfoot triple fusion ( haven't researched it yet so only have a tiny hall of what it involves). It makes the hip replacement seem minor. 2-3 hours surgery, and then 6 weeks non weight bearing and 6 weeks partial. 
Worse, we are now back to the eternal circle. He would need to do it after the hip is 100%. So he's saying at least 6 months, possibly 12, and probably 9. That's my 60th tour of central America gone. Or anything else that requires walking - I am probably going to still be on crutches for another year. Maybe more. 
I am just devastated. After the hip went so well I was thinking I would get my life back. And it's not going to happen.

Surgeon said scar healed nicely and a review in three months . He seemed a bit surprised that I had been in so much pain after the OP and said in some people the pain just gets ' switched off ' immediately . I said not with me . Showed my my X Ray's and the impressive 14 cm metal rod down my femur .. Then showed me how my
Hip was before and I think he said something about bi lateral wear and it looked pretty close to the bone .. I.e not much cartilage left . He said it was NOT cement .. Seemed to be in a sort of cap like shape .. Cannot remember what he called it . Does anyone know ? Your only in there for ten mins and I could not get enuf questions in .
I did say right what can I do to preserve this hip and how long do they last ? He smiled
And just said get on with it and forget about it ! Said these new joints can last 25 years ... Don't worry about it he said ! I said what can I or can't I do and he just said all restrictions are off from now and you can drive as long as your not a danger and restrictions off means obvious moderation
.. If it hurts a lot don't do it .
I said if I say lost two stones ( yup I
Need to ! ) would my hip last longer ? He just sort of shrugged his shoulders and said ' well ...' With no real definitive answer .
So it seems here in sunny wales it's all actions go as long as your sensible . When I said I took my stockings off after a week
he said I did not hear that ! So that must have been naughty ! Did not give me any no no 's about bending twisting sock putting on or anything .. How far do I walk ? I asked ... There are NO rules he replied . Just be sensible .
So laying on the bed with a bit of an ache , a dose of Anadin and a big mince pie to celebrate !

"I had total hip replacement of both left and right hips in the past six years. My right hip has been fine but my left hip has never been right it was done 3 years ago. I went back to my surgeon multiple times to tell him something was wrong but he kept telling me everything looks fine. Then he told me last fall all my pain was due to my back. So I went to a back surgeon and had to have back surgery last December. I didn't make progress and my back surgeon could find nothing wrong with my back after surgery. He was very caring and did every test in the book as opposed to my hip surgeon who did no test accept a x-ray. Back dock suggested a second opinion for my hip the second opinion doctor immediately saw the cup had to come loose and was at a place I had to have revision surgery the traditional way and have a 12 plus incision that refuses to heal and still seeps after a month. I am still in a lot of pain and recently begin swelling and both legs and lower abdomen they ran all kinds of tests but cannot come up with the reason for the swelling. In the meantime my surgeon suggest I go to a wound care specialist. I am waiting for the appointment and will likely get a wound vac. Do you think I have a lawsuit against the first hip doctor Who refused 2 believe anything what's wrong and I went for 3 years in pain and lost my career that I loved and now sits and do nothing and I'm depressed. I am not used to not being busy but I can't do much without pain and swelling. Just wondered what everyone's opinion was

"So, I have, well had, avascular necrosis in both hips. The right one was definitely worse. I had a thr on Aug 30, 2016, it became infected and on Sept 12, 2016 the took most of the hardware out and replaced it. Now 10 weeks post op and I have a lot of upper thigh pain and numbness from the top of my thigh to my knee. Walking is painful and difficult. Feels like I am sitting on a roll of paper towels! Not looking forward to having the left one done, and will not ever let this doctor touch me again.

"Hi folks. It's about 4 and a half weeks since I had my hip replacement. Is an uncemented hip replacement. I was fine and relatively pain free up to my physio appointment at 3 weeks when they told me to do more. Like getting up and down normally without stretching out the operated leg, walking indoors on 1 crutch and going up and downstairs more normally. I am now in pain when walking in the groin of my operated leg and not sure if this is normal or I am doing too much. I am 53 and want to get around more but finding it hard now this pain has come. Not seeing my consultant until the end of January so not sure who to ask. What if I have done some damage??

"Hi all! New to the group but not to hip issues. I just turned 37 and had my left hip replaced when I was 27 it failed and I had it replaced about 9 months later. Anyway I have had twings of pain occasionally for a few days here or there in the past few years but now I have an issue.
For about the past 6 months I get weak easily and tired out (didn't think much of it just thought I was pushing myself too much). This past week the pain has been constant sharp shooting pains to just dull aches when I am lucky. I have to push myself to finish anything that takes getting up and standing. The pain has been beginning to make me sick to my stomach again and I actually took some pain killers ( I hate taking pills). 
I don't want to worry my mom (she has enough stress as it is) and I don't think it is serious enough for the ER. But I have been feverish for the past three days as well - not in a flu, bad cold way more of the cold sweats type. My knee on my operate side feels like someone is constantly hitting it with something and my hip feels like a hot brand in around the top hip and sharp stabs, dull aches in my bikini line area. I also get what I call the someone walked over my grave shiver when out of the blue I shiver for a minute so noticeably that everyone else comments.
TMI Warning - I have to push myself to get up and go pee because the up and down motion makes me sick to stomach and a bit dizzy. 
Part of me thinks I should and know to worry but I am trying to think of something else so minor issue that can be fixed with a shot. I am defintely calling my family doctor tomorrow. Just wondering if someone had something similar or something - Thanks 
PS - I live in Canada

"I had my right THR done August 30, 2016. I have to admit, at this point,
it is the worst of all my surgeries how many you ask? Well since 2010,
I have had 5 on my left shoulder, 1 on my right shoulder, 1 on my right hip.
I am expected to have my left hip done in the next year or so.
Prior to 2010, I had my gall bladder removed, my first surgery on my right
Shoulder and both ankles operated on now about this pitting edema I have
in my right foot. I started cumaden right after surgery, bridged for one day.
when I got home, I started using xeralto and by day 4 at home, my right foot looked
was 4 times bigger. It seems to me that of the 11 surgeries I have had, I have gotten 3 blood clots,
the first one in 2010 after my second right shoulder surgery... My right upper
arm looked like one of those that suit Eddie Murphy wore. I went to the
Veterans Hospital ER in Portland, Oregon. They looked at my arm and said, ""nope""
you are fine, the swelling is from surgery! So I went home feeling as though
I was crazy. My wife, bless her heart, wouldn't give up and just trust the VA.
So we went to the Corvalliss ER and sure enough, I had 2 clots in my right
upper arm. Since then I have had seven more surgeries. This last surgery was
the THR, and once again I have what appears to be a blood clot in my leg.
I am so depressed, it's bad enough to need surgeries, but, blood blots??
Well I am falling asleep I look forward to hearing from you guys!

"Hi hippies,
Just wanted to say that I have found this forum absolutely invaluable and thank you to everybody who's contributed to it. It's been very re-assuring knowing that so many people are experiencing a similar situation.
Background: I'm an active 64 year old male, live in southern UK, who's been suffering increasing pain in my left hip for over 2 years. I saw my GP last year who suggested I have a THR but I went into denial, asked for pain killers and stated I was too young for such a radical operation - fool!
Roll on a year and asked the GP to update the paid meds but he refused and basically said ""let's get this sorted"". I had a consultation and X-ray at the end of August, diagnosed severe OA and was asked if I wanted the op in September (I panicked again), it was inconvenient etc and was asked what WAS convenient.  The NHS is truly marvellous.
Between late August and the 25th October when I had a LTHR posterior operation,I spent virtually every day in the gym concentrating on hip exercises.
It paid off, I spent 3 days in hospital, totally pain free, and have been ever since, was walking on 1 crutch within 2 weeks and have been exercising and walking ever since. I had my first physio today and they were very positive, doing well etc. so things are moving on.
I feel much happier than I've felt for several years and realise that the hip pain was dragging me down without recognising it.
It's not all sunlit uplands of course. It's such a drag sleeping on my back.
This month has been really tedious. Being stuck in the house apart from walks, not sleeping properly, watching TV for hours, it's all a bit Groundhog Day - but it's got to be done.
I've stuck religiously to the exercise regime but naively expected some sort of contact with somebody, anybody, to re-assure me after hospital discharge. An exercise sheet and some general guidelines aren't much comfort.I thought a district nurse or some such would ""pop in""! How old am I ha!
Looking forward to my 6 weekly review when hopefully I'll be able to drive - fingers crossed.
Best wishes and good luck to all.
Bob

To confirm the diagnosus of iliopsoas tendinitis as the cause of psin, my tendin was injected with lidocaine. The pain completely went away., but only for a few hours as Lidocane only lasts that long. My pt was completely changed and lying down is the omly comfortable position so I have rested the tenfon slot. Now at 7 months the pain has not let up. Got a second opinion, bone scan, mri. It is that tendinitis. Geeting a steroid shot into the tendon and was tolf if thst did not help the next strp is a tendon release surgery.

I live 1 mile from the office & I love to walk to & from the office as part of a healthy exercise regime.  I can't manage that distance in 1 go though, so I'm taking the bus in & a colleague gives me a lift home. Everyone at work looking out for me.  Young people take a lot of stick these days, but the ones I work with are amazing.  I can't thank the hospital team & post surgery support guys enough, they are wonderful.  I had a posterior incision & all was done under a spinal.  no crutch or cane needed & I feel liberated.  I saw the consultant & physio Tuesday of this week and both are happy.  Seeing them again mid January.  My wife & family are so good.  I will be 65 next June but  plan to work on until I'm 70, we all need goals in life & working to 70 is one of mine.  To those awaiting surgery who may have concerns, you are in good hands.  Post op, do your exercses including the walks & accept all the aids available to you.  Eat well, exercise well, rest well.  Encourage others.  Blessings, Ray

I've got his assistants phone number, so can phone anytime I want if I have any concerns, but he believes that if I keep to the ""slow and steady"" build up back to normal life I'll be fine.
The X-ray shows the replacement perfectly positioned, and all the histologies came back clear. Not a thing to worry about.

"Hi fellow Hippies,
I had my first left hip replacement in January and my second in September. In my mind's eye, the first replacement was without hiccups and I sailed through to complete recovery.  However, the second, whilst, of course, making a comparison, was no where near as good as the first and I felt I was way behind with my recovery.
Today, seven weeks post op, I saw my Consultant.  I had with me a list of questions. My name was called and without realising, I walked, unaided into his office.
I told him that I had a leg discrepancy; that I still had pain within my groin and also over the prosthesis; within the middle of my thigh and that it really hurt when rising from a chair. I also relayed that I did not feel that I had progressed as well this time and that, previously, by seven weeks post op, I had been virtually pain free.
Regarding the leg discrepancy, I was shown my X Ray that, quite clearly, revealed, a slightly tilted pelvis; this made my newly operated hip/leg very slightly longer. This, can be rectified by merely wearing a comfort sole within my left shoe. I had visions of forever having a limp or the need to wear ugly built up shoes. Not so.
Regarding my recovery.
Prior to my TLHR, I was, for a very long time, in inexorable agony and my hip was in a really terrible state. For this, I received a fully cemented replacement. My Consultant explained that, as a result of  the torturous agony, prior to the first op, any discomfort, after the surgery, in comparison, appeared minor and this is what I remembered.(Rose coloured glasses).
With the second,although I was in a great deal of pain, I had not reached the agonising, inexorable stage and I received a ""hybrid replacement"". This is when only the stem is cemented and your own bone adheres and grows over the prosthesis. A procedure that will last much longer than the fully cemented.
All that I am experiencing now, I did experience before. I did have pains within my groin; over and along the prosethis; it did hurt when I got up from a seated position and, without the aid of a crutch, I did limp.  In fact, everything that I am now feeling is completely normal and I am not, in any way, behind with my recovery.
Now that I am thinkly clearly, I recall, when nine weeks post op after my first hip replacement, I collected my Granddaughter from school. The school kept the disabled bay clear and I walked, with the aid of a crutch into the school where, through exhaustion, I had to sit down. In truth, I returned to my aqua areobic class some thirteen to fourteen weeks after the first op and I found it to be really hard going.
So don't beat yourselves up.  It takes time. And if you are having or have received a second op, don't like me, make comparisons as they are likely to be fanciful.
I am so much happier now and thinking in a straight line.
Take Care, all of you.
Rocketman.
Did you have your revision?  If so, how did it go.

"Hi All,
Has anyone ever had a failed hip steroid injection? (i.e. one that didn't bring them any pain relief, or even made pain worse), but then went on to have a successful THR?
I find myself in a random position where my steroid injection has made my groin/hip pain worse. It was being used as a diagnosis excercise but hasn't helped at all. I also suffer from some chronic pain in wrists and ankles.
I'm now terrified that a THR will actually make my pain worse (given that the steroid injection should've helped if the hip was the issue).
Any advice is much appreciated!

"I am a 38 year old woman. I have always been active. I have 3 children, worked a lot but this time last year I started having low back pain, it carried to my groin etc. I'm sure you all know the feeling since we've all had a hip replacement here. So I went in on Nov 2 for my first minimally invasive hip replacement. I can't describe how wonderful it went! After I woke up from surgery I never had any pain! PT was a breeze! One day after my two week appointment I was sitting on the couch and when I got up I heard a POP and sure enough my hip was dislocated.
The next night my surgeon came in to fix it. He popped it back into place but he said when he put me on the Hanna board that it kept popping back out so he did a revision. I am on day 3, I just got home from the hospital and I feel like I'm going insane! None of this feels normal! I feel as if my hip will come out again every time I stand up. I am being so careful but it's tight and hurts. I'm sure I'm just scared and I will be ok but please someone tell me I'm not the only one laying in my bed ridden with fear?

The 2nd night I noticed that my opposite hip started going numb from my hip to my knee. I told the nurse and she said it could be a sleepy nerve or pinched because of being placed on that side for the
surgery...makes sense. Then the second morning at home, I woke up and a wierd feeling came up from the back of my rt hip and traveled across my lower back to my other hip. It was an odd kind of feeling and somewhat
painful. So I took my pain meds and went back to sleep.

I'm on the front line at work so on my feet all day and work with the elderly so move and handle a lot. Any hippies out there any advice re muscles and work. Thank you

"Hello!  I'm not quite at 2 weeks as that will be Monday.  I've meant to be on to give an update prior to today but my tablet wasn't cooperating.  Still doing well.  Walking a bit with a cane everyday at this point.  I went to the mall for a quick jaunt yesterday to a game store to pick up Five Crowns, which is a game my family loves.  It was great to get out even for just a little bit.  On Thursday, I was feeling depressed and cooped up.  As I'm sure everyone is, I was used to being to get up and go whenever I wanted to and now I found myself needing help for a lot.  I knew it would be this way, but it does get to you every so often.  My wonderful husband noticed and took me out to the park.  It made all the difference in the world.  Just getting out for about an hour and sitting on a park bench in the open air changed up my entire outlook.  I am so grateful to my husband for his help and attention.  Without him, this would be so much harder.  I am excited by my progress but at the same time frustrated that I'm not moving faster.  Is that crazy?  Well, anyway.  Almost 2 weeks out and am doing very well.  If you are in Ohio, I highly recommend Dr. Politti with Orthopedic 1.  I had almost zero swelling and the pain was so much lower than I expected.  He's a truly gifted surgeon.  Beyond that I recommend the same things everyone else here does:  keep up on your pain meds for at least the first week so that the pain doesn't hinder your progress for that first week, make sure you do your physio as that is what is bringing your muscles back and ice, ice, ice!  Listen to your body.  If it says it is tired, it is and you need to rest.  But also make sure you get some fresh air as well.  Staying cooped up will hit you emotionally and that is worse than the physical pain.  Everyone that is approaching their surgery - good luck to you and it will make your life so much better!  Thank you to everyone on this forum for giving advice on how to best help yourself after surgery.  Everything you said helped me!

I hadn't posted anything in a while, I have been really busy with family issues and my studies.
Yesterday I was 16 weeks from my right hip replacement... I am still attending physio and she is really happy with my progress. In two weeks time I am going to do hypnotherapy so hopefully that goes well. I am back to see my doctor in January to talk about my other hip!! Hopefully I get it done next June.
At this moment I am getting pain in my knee and elbow, my elbow is under investigation.
I hope everyone is well!!

"I saw my physiotherapist for the first time on Monday of this week. Since I'm doing really well with my recovery and am already off crutches and walking outside with just a cane, she had me doing squats and standing on one leg.
She explained something that I thought was fascinating. Our brains normally take information about balance from our hips. When a hip is replaced with a prosthetic it doesn't send any signals so our brain has to make new pathways and find different ways of working out where to put our feet. That's why we feel so strange when we first walk after surgery - well I did anyway. I felt like my leg didn't belong to me and wouldn't do as it was told at all!
I wish someone had explained this beforehand as I thought I had nerve damage or something! My brain is obviously catching up now because I'm walking more or less normally. Still have to concentrate quite hard on uneven surfaces though and come home tired, Not just physically but mentally.
So the moral is: if your operated on leg doesn't feel like it's yours it's because your brain doesn't yet think it is!

"So it is now 11 weeks since my hip replacement. Here's my report:
Walking about half the time without a crutch. Short distances are fine but still need it just for lightly balancing on longer walks and when I'm tired.
Sleeping great. Can sleep in any position. Sometimes needs some Tylenol at bedtime if I've had a physical day.
Stamina is returning slowly. Can certainly walk greater distances than I have been able to in at least a year. My unoperated side has referred pain to the knee so that's what is holding me back right now. Operated side has no pain at all.
Still have a bit of limp but that's my fault for skipping exercises. When I remember to do them I feel a difference.
Back at work full time and managing well.
Swelling around scar only subsided about 2 weeks ago. Scar is more purple and visible. Sometimes pinches and is itchy but nothing major.
I need to work more on positions I have avoided for years - squatting, bending knees, bringing leg up to tie shoes, etc. I'm stiff when I try these so I need to push a little more.
Still Fing vacuuming and mopping hard. The combination of balancing and pushing is still exhausting.
Hope this helps. I'm so glad I got it done and feel so much better. I recovered fairly quickly even though it felt long at the time.

Stairs no lift!!!  ramps well if you can walk a steep hill it would be fine!! hate to think of a wheelchair on them.
I will now embark on going to a pool in the UK to get back some movement once I can get rid of the stiffness and pain through having to do so much.   Would take me ages to get to meals... still on my crutches as my knees are so bad.
Physio booked for next week and hopefully they can get me some hydrotherapy to loosen up some tightness in my thighs.  I did my exercises each day but had hoped some water would help.
I am not going to let this spoil my recovery just look at it as a bad experience and a learning curb... I now know how much I can do...  one positive thing only need to take high dose of painkillers at night now which is somethng.

"I have seen it many times live recording on u tube and virtual. There are special tables designed to X-ray the implant on the table to match up hip length,even tables designerd with ski boots to hold legs straight during surgery and to drop low to implant the femur component without disturbing muscle, ligaments and tissue thru anterior approach. Ski boots only in California. Hehe.
Always I ask before surgery what manufacturer/model to look the surgery up on YouTube each one is different. Also be sure there are no metal on metal components can cause serious THR failure.
How many THR per year of the same model does the surgeon implant and the success rate, as well as how long the model has been in the current market. The is a registry of EVERY joint implant DONE the UK, Scotland and Australia. The US has just started a registry. KEEPS up with all the results ages, surgeons and manufacturers. And much more. 
Watching the THR process helped me understand how critically important it was for the experienced surgeon to be very familiar with the same techniques and have good surgical assistants to see and hear the explanation as the surgeon proceeds thru surgery on you tube.
How many know the name of the manufacturer and seen the implant components you sport. It's all on the OR REPORT. The registration # is on each kit. Each hip kit has many different sizes included in the kit for the femur and ball joint with liners. Screws are sometimes included if needed. Some are press fit others are cemented in with antibiotics. All with designs to fit each individual patient.
Usually today leg length is not as much a problem due to new techniques and better quality of implants. 
Anyone have any thing more to ask their surgeons before surgery? It really quite an art replacing any joint. Improves our quality of life.

"Well here I am at day 5. I am ""dismissing"" my caring friend officially today, as I am happy that I can cope without her. She won't be going very far away (two streets!) and I have lots of friends and neighbour available to help at the drop of a hat. But I feel confident now that I can begin the road to normality, and I am keen to do it!
?My first day home (Thursday) I was soooo tired! The effort of getting home exhausted me, but before having a nap on the sofa I insisted on making lunch. Just soup and rolls, but I wanted to make it myself. I told my friend all along that she was there to make sure I did not harm doing things, not doing them for me, and she's stuck pretty well to what I wanted. I have been sensible - so things like vacuuming etc., I have had help with. But basic day to day stuff is down to me. Scruffy floors won't kill me, but not eating might!
?As anticpated, the first night home I used every trick in the book to try to sleep on my back, and had every aid going to help me do so. No way was anything working. The spine just was not having it, and it was that that hurt - not the hip! So after a couple of fruitless hours I threw everything in a heap on the floor and reached for my trusty pillow, which I had been using before the op due to the pain from the osteonecrosis. In seconds I was fast asleep and got a full nights sleep - the same again last night. I know we aren't supposed to sleep on our sides, but sleep is healing, so I compromise had to be made, and this is it. With this pillow and and a leg lifter I can get in and out of bed and sleep well, all on my own. The last two mornings I have woken really well rested and raring to go, and so I won't complain about the fact that I am sleeping ten hours straight - my normal is seven at most. I know I need it right now!
?Exercise is getting easier, although I haven't ventured outside yet. That is on the schedule for today. I have a really good range of movement, although it still does differ a bit during the day. There's nothing that I can't do, but sometimes I can't do it at one time, but can at another. I'm just going with the flow - I'm up to my maximum in all areas already, and just pushing an extra one or two if I feel I can. I know not to push too much as my physio (I had one before this) had already read me the lecture on not overdoing it either. She knows me too well!
?Pain, almost non-existant! I have accidentally ""touched"" the scar area when moving (for example, last night getting into bed), and believe me, it lets me know not to do that! But it's to be expected that there will be occasional brushes with objects, and I'm going to discuss with the GP on Tuesday a schedule of reducing my meds a bit - I've been on very high levels of painkillers for a long time now (morphine patches for the last 5 weeks), and I know that with the other stuff going on I can't just throw them all away once this is over - but I hope to get a significant reduction. If I could aim to reduce just to my co-codomol and gabapentin, I'd be a happy bunny!
?Problems? Well, ok folks, who was the idiot who didn't tell you that you need two grabbers in reach? Because you need a grabber to pick up the grabber that you dropped on the floor!
?And tips? Well this one came from my regular physio, who is really, really experienced and qualified. She told me that, within the bounds of caution, the ""rules"" about bending and stretching etc., are vased on no clear clinical practice! Her and some colleagues tracked the progress of THR patients for three months after surgery, and the dislocation rate was not related to following the rules or not - it was a lottery! She advised to loosely follow the rules (so no sitting cross legged, because that is silly), but otherwise approach movements with caution and listen to your body because it is going to tell you what it wants to do. So I haven't been blatently breaking the rules, but I feel so much more relaxed about moving around and trying things.
?My curent goal is to be well enough for my dog to come home on Thursday next week. He's a 14 month old border collie, well trained and very savvy - but boisterous because that's his age. He hasn't fully grown up yet. But I miss him, and every time I do something I am seeing him out of the corner of my eye, or expecting him to appear! I won't be able to walk him properly yet, but I have a loaned scooter which we have been using for some months already, so he can accompany me on my growing walks, and still get his mad runs around the park! The physio looked at me like I was mad when she discovered I didn't have a small dog, and kept repeating the mantra ""but he could pull you over"" despite the number of times I told her that this simply wasn't going to happen because trained intelligent dogs didn't pull their owners over!
?Anyway, I know I am not out of the woods yet. But when I first discovered this forum it was a great place to get information, but felt kind of scary since the majority of the posts were about stuff that went wrong. Understandably, and it is a serious operation and for some people it doesn't have the anticipated good outcomes. There's still no guarantees for me either, and I accept that. But I hope this helps anyone about to go through the op, that there is light at the end of the tunnel. And it is daylight!

"hello hippies
Two weeks today since my L THR.  Doing great I think. Walking around the house without crutches and walked around half a mile outside with just a walking stick. Not much pain at all and what there is is all from the incision wound. That's still a bit swollen and sore but dry and healing well by the looks of things. 
Only discovered a massive  bruise at the back of my knee fairly recently. It looks like I've been kicked by a horse! Starting to fade a bit now and I've been putting witch hazel on it which seems to help. 
Sorry to to hear stories of people not recovering so well and wondered whether to post this. But it's not a competition is it and we're all different. I know that when I was nervous pre-op it helped to read about positive experiences. Apart from a few days in the first week this has been a positive experience for me and I'm getting glimpses of what a pain free life might feel like! 
Healing vibes to everyone.

"Despite receiving both Propofol and Midazolam/Versed to provide amnesia during my general anesthesia, I was awake for probably 5-10 minutes near the end of my hip replacement. I didn't feel any pain and I had watched at least a dozen surgery videos so if anything I was intrigued by my experience. Probably wouldn't have been if I had still been awake for extubation, but my anesthesiologist must have noticed something and I was suddenly out again. I know it wasn't a dream because I heard my surgeon say ""Hold on. Wait a minute. We've got to get an X-ray of the hip.""  Several days after my surgery my hospital sent me an electronic copy of my hip X-ray with same date and time.
So my flashback hadn't occurred yet while I was in the hospital and I had already filed a complaint against the anesthesiologist for giving me the Versed against my wishes (which he did to give me amnesia in the event of awareness) as well as other unprofessional behavior. My surgeon only operates in that hospital and he is aware of my complaint. 
So do I let this go so it doesn't get on my medical record? Do I talk to the anesthesiology department despite my previous complaint? Do I talk to my surgeon to verify his comment during surgery if he remembers it 8 weeks later? I contacted the national awareness registry run by a university med school and national anesthesiology association to learn if they thought I truly had awareness or just a dream. It seems they think awareness but now they want all kinds of medical records and I worry about guarantees of the privacy of my data.  Especially when my hospital is contacted. Anyone have any experience with this?

Crossed fingers, no real pain at all. More of a dull ache or soreness. I'm hoping to get home today but it may be tomorrow as my consultant is being ultra careful about possible infection etc., due to complexities - when the hip collapsed in the summer he was concerned about infection indicators in my blood tests that were unexplained. But hopefully tomorrow at the latest.
Physio is hard work but getting there! It's frustrating that one time I can manage the movement and the next time I cannot shift the leg at all. But I am walking reasonably well  - by the first walk I was doing better than I had for several weeks before surgery! So it's onwards and upwards and waiting for breakfast. Luxury - someone else makes breakfast!

"HI all not been on much lately im 7 weeks  rthr  still walking with 1 crutch as i have a awful limp but have severe osteoarthritis in both hips i went for my 6 week post check yesterday and the surgeon expalained that my limp was because my bad hip has totally worn away my leg has dropped and i will have to use a crutch until the next op which he got me to sign consent form for and put me on the waiting list. imagine my shock when the postman brought the post and a letter telling me my surgery for lthr is on the 6th december so just 10weeks apart im still having pains and soreness from the 1st op and still feeling tired due to not being able to sleep so god knows how im gonna be after the second one.

"Yesterday evening, I went swimming. Exactly 7 weeks after TRHR. I had checked with physio at my 6 week assessment and was told that swimming is one of the best things that I can do. Including breaststroke. So, that is what I did, I was rather nervous, and found myself swimming like a one-legged frog...the right leg I kind of just let it paddle about for a bit, then tried some Very small kicking leg movements with it.  I also did some walking from one side of the pool to the other, in the shallow end haha!  some gentle lunges and side stepping. All in all, I was very happy with the 40 minutes I spent in the pool. Today, I was pleasantly suprised to find that I didn't ache any more than I usually do, and am going swimming again tomorrow evening. 
I must admit, I wasn't sure about breaststroke, but, my physio explained that because the joint is a ball and socket, rotating around is what it is designed for and is meant to do, just to start of very very slowly and work up from there. I'm not a strong swimmer, and in fact I don't even really like swimming, but, it was deeply satisfying to be able to get out and do some form of exercise that didn't involve the use of a crutch, or a stick, or having to be careful where I walk. A sense of freedom, almost, is what I'm trying to say. The most difficult part, for me, was trying to peel off a wet swimsuit!  
I can't wait for tomorrow.

"I had my hip replacement surgery today. Went in to the surgery
center at 10:30, had the surgery and had a pt session and then
went home at around 6. Can`t lift my leg by myself but I can move
slowly with a walker. A nurse is coming at 9 am to check on me
and a pt therapist is coming at noon. Doing well. I do have some
referred pain in my knee which is my biggest complaint. However
except for that all the pain is in the muscles or at the incision site
which will heal. The bone deep pain is gone which is lovely.
Hopefully can get some sleep tonight. Will talk later!

"My husband had a THR on October 14th, 2016 almost 4 weeks ago and now has an ifection in the wound. Can anyone share feedback about wound infections after THR. He saw his surgeon on Tuesday (the surgeon said it wasnt that bad) and got antibiotics, had a visit with wound care today for the 1st time, they said it is pretty bad. He is getting a second antibiotic to take and we will need to keep the wound dry and covered. No talks of having it opened or flushed have been discussed. We are very nervious because we know that infections are not good especially in this case. We would love your help and prayers.

But all of that is fixable with proper physical therapy and massaging. I still have weak hip muscles so he's given me some new exercises to do as well as work hard on those abductor muscles!! Those are soooo weak. And to start working on using a cane. I still have the 90% hip flexion precautions and no twisting!! Giving me a lil more freedom with a lil hint of precaution. It's good to know that hip is fine. I'm 3 ml short compared to 4 cm!!

"My son is the double hippie - first, LTHR 3/8/16, second, RTHR 7/5/16. He is going to a clinic where the care seems to be more managed - the reason he chose it. He had a PT consult, ENT, internist. He will see other specialists as needed. Included is a nutritional consult, and he had an acupuncture session. He didn't say much about it, except that he had a bruise on one foot and discomfort there as the needle was removed. The acupuncturist is a naturopath, and also suggested he drink a calcium-magnesium-citrate powder to be dissolved in liquid. HORRID! He needs to mix it in juice. The acupuncture session must have been ok - he has 3 more scheduled. 
Have any of you had this as part of your therapy to recover from THR, or for other reasons? What did you think? 
It's hard to tell a younger person like my son that it could be 8 more months before he is able to walk more than 4 blocks and not feel tired, or to have the energy he once had. 
Hope you are all recovering well.

Very pleased with how things are going. Hip and thigh are still swollen but pain isn't bad at all and I've taken nothing but ibuprofen and paracetamol for 3 or 4 days now. I'm using one crutch indoors and can walk without anything as long as I'm careful and have furniture to grab if necessary.
Slightly overdid the exercises yesterday I think so taking it easier today.
I know we are all different and don't heal at the same rate. I imagine there will be further twists in the road but at the moment I'm so grateful for modern medicine that can help with OA pain and give us a new lease of life.

"3 weeks ago I had a RIGHT hip replacement.   Surgeon told me, in the hospital, everything went o.k. however, there is a little crack in my pelvis, he said he either pressed too hard and/or condition of my bones was the reason of a little crack in the pelvis.   He said he put pins in the cracked pelvis and I wil recover fine.
It is almost 3 months and I am not able to walk without a slight pinch in that area, it is very uncomfortable when I walk.   I am very, very disturbed.   My 2nd post visit to see the surgeon is next week!   
the Physical Thrapist statd that I should be walking without any cane or walker.   I do walk without them, however that ""pinch"" is very uncomfortable and I want to know what's happening?  Is this a malpractice, should I seek a second opinion?   I am totally disturbed and don't want to be ""uncool"" when I see him next week for a progress report.
By the way, I am a vegetarian, quite fit for my age, very active and have never been in the hospital before my hip replacement, since the birth of my son 42 years ago!!!!
Also, 3 years ago, I did have a left hip replacement, bone to bone, and everything went perfect!!   My left leg was a little' longer than the right side.    Three years later 2016, I thought this right hip repacement would correct that difference (since it too was arthritic, but NOT bone to bone)
Post operation on my right side, there is a ""balance"" no shorter or longer, but this pinch in my joint on my right side is my complaint.   NO IT IS NOT A CONSTANT PAIN, ONLY WHEN I WALK AND IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.   MY REGUALR GAIT HAS NOT RETURNED!!
I AM LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AND NO MORE SURGERY!!!

"I had my hip replacement 1 month ago today.  Am using a cane and sometimes walk a few steps without any help.  The biggest problem is that when I stand up to walk, the first few steps are weak and hard to get started, just like before the THR but worse. Once I walk 4 or 5 steps it gets much better.  
I assumed this was normal.   At my appointment today, the doctor was obviously concerned that this was happening.  He said he's seen it before, but not often. He said the x-rays show the procedure went well and there are no problems with the implant.  Is this weakness and inability to take the first few steps a normal problem after hip surgery?

"Hi
I've read a few stories and if you are about to have an op maybe mine is not the one to read! There are plenty of successful ones.
In June 2015 I had a THR; I was fit and took part in lots of sports (even with the pain). I had suffered for years with things getting worse, after a consultation where I was told there was no problem, I sort a second opinion where the consultant had me on the table within 2 weeks!
I did a lot of yoga, pilates and other gym work before the operation the flexibility helped a lot after the op.
Anyway having had the op I had quite a lot of pain as expected, one thing I noticed after my op was that my knee was more swollen and painful than my hip, even my discharge note said I had a knee replacement! I never got an answer to that and iot took a good 3-4 months before the knee recovered.
At the 3 month pass I was still in serious pain unable to walk very far and falling over from time to time still pain in the muscles and knee. My doctor requested x-ray痴 and finally referred me for an assessment.
At 6 months I finally got the assessment from a Chartered Physio, comment from them was, limited muscle regeneration, limited movement. the worst they had seen. I was walking a little further but still severely restricted, with pain to my knee, and pins and needles, I also have the feeling of tearing and pain along the scar line.
Now 14 months, I have had a reasonable improvement with the muscle regeneration but the pain is still constant.
The pain is not in the joint itself but the muscles surrounding the joint, not just the glutes. I have been trying to get an MRI to see what the problems are. My thoughts are that something has been trapped or damaged.
The pain is still there are bouts when it intensifies, sometimes I can walk without a limp but not for long.
This week I will return to my doctors to push for some further tests. I am at a loss I have had regular massages which show that the muscles are always very tight.
What I noticed was that no one in the medical profession wants to listen, it is always a case of this is what is expected or well you have to expect this or put it down to other conditions that you have.

"Hi All:
thought I would update you on my issues with hip pain in both hips, pins and needles in feet, back pain, compression, headaches.
I saw my surgeon yesterday. Outcome is that the hip x ray showed everything is fine with the hip in place nicely from surgery outcome. I am 12 weeks so he lifted all precautions. As far as my symptoms go, the resident and surgeon say it's not my hip, everything points to my back being the issue. He gave a possible Diagnosis of Greater Trochanteric pain syndrome to explain the swelling and pain in both hips. I know some other hippies like Renee have this condition. In terms of the back pain and other symptoms, he said it could be Spinal Stenosis but not likely as I did fine on his testing my  flexibility, strength, feeling in my limbs. So he gave me a script for a strong anti inflammatory, recommended continued physio, and ordered a CT lumbar scan. I see him in 3 months. Somewhat overwhelming but fortunately I was able to get an appt. with my physio for Monday. Getting some relief from the anti inflammatory and pain meds. 
from the brief follow up reading I did, since I am thinking that I have Piriformis Syndrome.  I read an article called Its a Pain in the Butt, Hip and Leg. 'This condition is referred pain in the posterior hip caused by atrophy or spasm of the Piriformus muscle. The pain associated with this condition often mimics the signs and symptoms of lumbar nerve root compression or sciatica in the buttock and posterior leg.' One of the main symptoms I have is a feeling of a weight in the back of my thigh and top of my buttocks if I am sitting too long fits with Periformis Syndrome.
Anyway, hope to discuss it with the physio and get the right exercises to do.
On a positive note, With restrictions lifted, I actually started bending to reach for things and was able to climb into the Jacuzi tub for the first time since surgery.
Hope you hippies have a good weekend. Thanks everyone for your support from my previous post about my symptoms.

"Hi, any advice on how to go about speeding up a NHS hip replacement.
Xray 14 days ago shows severe left hip athritis, doctor says hip undoubtedly needs replacing (right hip replaced privately 2yrs ago). Doctor is writing to local NHS consultant/department.
Severe pain even when popping prescribed tablets; with very poor mobility, i.e. using a stick but still needing to hang onto objects and dread the morning and night time stairs, wouldn't even consider using them during the day time.
I would like to consider NHS this time to avoid costs but I am told by the doctor that UK North West waiting list will be months, she does not seem as though she can speed things up. Travel even by comfortable car is a painful procedure.
Any advice please.

"Has anyone had more pain in hip sitting than walking?  My GP treated with a steroid injection which did not help and Naproxen.   I then had an ex ray and MRI.  After the MRI the GP made an appoint for me with an orthopedic surgeon which is tomorrow.  The nurse didn't know what the MRI showed.

"I have been a bit worried about my wound for that last couple of days.
it has been 2 weeks today since my THR on my left hip, so I went to the doctor to get the dressing removed this morning and YAY, it is all healing up nicely. Just one problem. I never asked him about if it would be ok to shower now, he said I can give it a clean with some warm water, but not sure about showering. Do any of you guys know what I would be best off doing??

"I had a left total hip replacement done 1 year ago.  I will get a good month where I forget I even had surgery done. Then the next month something is hurting.  Last month it was my upper thigh and groin area.   That went away. Now these last three days it's my lower outer thigh.  I can take a few steps without hurting then it will hurt something awful. I can't put full weight on it.   So I have to sit down for awhile and rest it.  I am icing it.  I had X-rays done 3 weeks ago and everything looked great.   
I feel like I always hit a few bumps in the road then I feel good for a short period.  Anyone else go through this?  My joint itself is never the problem.  It's everything around it that acts up.   Then when I stress about it I feel like my muscles tighten up which does not help.  My life is definitely better since my replacement but I want complete normalcy and it is just not happening.  I do have another apt with my surgeon next week. I would love to know if anyone else has gone through this. 
Thanks

"Or ONE THR, for that matter! 
Aloha - I am not the hippie - my 30 year old son had two. First March 8 LTHR, second July 5 RTHR. He is not in pain, but walking more than 3 blocks is tiring and can cause discomfort. He has a new GP who is intelligent and listens. Also a smart PT person. She gave him tips on walking - neither heel nor toe, but sort of flat-footed. Probably good advice for both of us - we are so afraid of slipping on wet streets and pavement plus leaves! Also how to sit - sort of roll back with your pelvis. And finally, a sort of kneeling lunge. This is easy enough on the left side, a struggle on the right. I tried to do this exercise - easy on the left, but it kills my bad right knee. 
Okay, the JEANS. I was asked to pose this question to you - do your jeans still fit after the surgeries? I guess the topography shifted somehow. Same weight, but somehow redistributed. Any thoughts are appreciated.

"Hello again. Five days post op now (L THR) and yesterday was by far the worst. Lots of pain, headache etc. Feel loads better today though and have even managed a proper wash with my husband's help. I have clean hair! Yay!
One question today. I've noticed I now have an enormous amount of bruising- yellow and sort of green around the top of my leg and inside my thigh and a black and purple bruise at the back of my knee. I didn't notice them until today when I was properly stripped off for a wash in daylight!
I'm sure this is normal too and will fade with time. Anyone any thoughts about how to help it all go down? I've been taking Arnica tablets since the op so it doesn't look like they've done much! Any other suggestions? The wound site is very puffy still and hurts when I walk.

"HIP PRECAUTIONS ARE NO LONGER A ROUTINE
The routine use of HIP precautions for all patients after total hip replacement has now been shown to be. I longer necessary.
Removing restrictions has been shown to increase recovery rates and increase patients satisfaction without increasing the rate of dislocation.
Patients are encouraged to move in any way they find comfortable. They can return to normal activities as soon as they feel able to do so. Patients can stop using their walking aids whenever they feel able to.
They may sleep on there sides, shower normally and drive when they feel able to and when they have assessed there own safety with driving. THEY SHOULD NOTIFY THERE INSURANCE COMPANIES.
I HOPE THIS CAN HELP SOME OF YOU HIPPIES OR MAYBE ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS
Keep smiling. Julie. X

"Hi. I'm sure this has been covered a million times but would appreciate some input. Had my left hip replaced on Friday morning - posterior approach, ceramic head and cemented stem - and was discharged from hospital yesterday. Don't feel too bad - not much pain - but hip is very swollen this morning. I imagine this is fairly normal but I did ring up and they've given me an outpatient appointment for this afternoon.
I also seem to be getting light headed after the slightest exertion which is a bit disappointing. Is that normal too? I know it's very early days (only 3 days) so I assume that resting a lot is ok until I feel stronger?
This op is a lot harder to get over than I'd anticipated! Perhaps my expectations were a bit unrealistic ;-)

I'm walking completely unaided but don't seem to be able to go very far without getting a sore back and leg, not in the hip but the muscle.

"Hi guys. Havent been active recently so a lot of you wont know me so ill do a qui k summary abd update.
Im 20 years old and had my thr in April. Due to AVN since 7 and the fact i didnt have a hip my surgery took 7.5 hours, no weight baring for 8 weeks then partcial for another 6. Iv currently had 14 surgeries. 13 on my hips and knees and one on my collarbone. This one was 10 weeks after my thr so not ideal.
So since the thr I have noticed I still have 0 internal rotation, and its now harder to dress my lower body and shave my legs ect. My back pain has increased severly and i am waiting to go for an mri. I also had a full leg xray when i went to hospital last week to see what is wrong with my knees. Its also been discovered that 1 leg is longer than the other but considering they used to be 2 inches difference im not bothered. Still having to use crutches and my mobility is severlu limited. I am suffering in extreme pain all day every day from the neck down to be honest. Some days I cant even get out of bed.
I am back at college doing 2 night classes. As soon of you know, i sat my exams a few weeks after my thr with a lot of difficulties. Ubfortanetly I was 4 marks from the Grade I needed so I am resiting tge exam this week. I am also doing a GCSE english course on a Wednesday night with my fiance. When in college I am constently having to get up and walk because my hips and back get very very sore and by the time I get home Im crying from the pain.
Im 20 years old and I have lived in pain all my life with mobility issues but since the thr my pain has become so much worse and im losing all faith that it will ever get better. I barely leave the house other than to go to college and occassionally support my brother during his races. But doing this i certainly pay for later. Iv been put on anti depressents as I went to the dkctors to talk about the pain and just burst into tears. These should be the best years of my life, i should be making memories but instead im stuck in the house in crippling pain. Iv also been referred to a pain clinic but my appointment usnt till Janurary which is shocking to be honest.
Im not telling you all this for pity or anything. And not all causes are bad. Most people thrive after this surgery. But i constently seem yo be unlucky and something is clearly wrong with my back and knees. To all thoughs who know me I hope you are all doing fantastic and im sorry its been so long. To the newbies, i hope you too will soon be back to living life as you should be

"I don't even know what to say..... It is 8 weeks since my hip revision. 2 weeks now that I've been full weight bearing and walking. Dr still has the hip precautions I seem him Oct 18. I can't get myself out of this depression. Crying every day. Thoughts of hopelessness and feel like I can't go on. I try to be positive, comment on all who post with well wishes and prayers. There have been some with some very sad stories and hardships. I keep trying to tell myself it's gonna be ok....but I can't get myself to believe that. I lay in bed and don't want to move. I'm not in pain when I walk. It's just that it feels so tight when I take a step. My knee barely bends at 60 degrees with a little force. It feels weird when I walk. And it discourages me so much. I can say there has been improvement in the feeling but it's still there and I fall back into depression and discouragement. My daughter is getting ready to go into basic training and I'm already missing her. I'm worried about my granddaughter, her daughter, cause I'm not sure how she will take it. She's 13. Plus I'm useless right now. I can't take her to school as I can't drive yet. Then today I find out my grandmother is in hospital and very weak. She's 109! Sad part for me is I won't be able to see her or go to her funeral if she does pass away. She lives 6 hours away. I'm still having problems sitting as I have that dang lump in my thigh/bum area! I'm still having to ice. And I use heat. Last Friday I went to my daughter's house for the evening. It was nice to finally get out but I had to take that darn potty chair and took my wheelchair so I had a place to sit as to not break the 90 degree. I'm so scared of that! I'm scared to bear full weight too! I try but I get scared! Thanks for letting me vent. I just want to feel better again. My family needs me.

"Hi folks,
Looking for some advice on my situation from this great forum if I can....
I'm 35, very active/competitive in sport for all of my life, until now.
Unfortunately, I now have severe OA in both hips which is painful and very much effecting my mobility. For at least three years now. I can deal with the pain, currently take 30/500 cocodamol. I have pain getting in and out of the car, putting on socks, carrying my son etc but I can still sleep at night, so not terrible yet.
However, the terribly mobility means I am no where near as active in sport and this is truly making me miserable. I have a two year old son and it even effects my ability to play with him, carry him, and things like that.
My doctor is keen to put the surgery off as long as possible due to my age, and I understand that, but although I could continue in this way for the foreseeable future I am truly miserable and feel like a zombie.
I feel like just getting the surgery now so I can get on with my life and regain my mobility, exercise and play with my son properly. Hopefully!
Has anyone any thoughts or advice on this? Or has anyone been through a similar situation at a younger age?
Thanks!

"I'm 2 weeks post op. Staples out yesterday. Incision is closed and looks fine. I've been having some pain in the front of my thigh. Groin area? I read several posts earlier about possibly the muscle healing etc. i took pain meds twice today but then stopped because I didn't feel they were working all that great plus a general desire to stop them altogether. I stopped the anti inflammatory on Wednesday I think - again I was still having pain and as with the heavier dose of pain meds slight nausea - or just not feeling great. Didn't want to keep taking meds if they were not working. So, I was sleepy from earlier pain meds - in bed by 8:30 tonight. Woke about 10:30. Leg hurting to where I needed to use walker instead of cane to get to bathroom. I'm having to physically lift my leg where days before I could just lift to get in and out if bed. I can tell there is still some swelling in butt. Could this be inflammation related pain? Going back on anti inflammatory and pain meds for the weekend. Thoughts? Experiences? Had been doing great prior to this. Therapist was surprised at my progress. Thanks.

I ended up having to go on disability in July of 2012. I'm in constant pain in my hip, groin, and thigh. When I sneeze or cough I almost hit the ground the pain gets so bad, The orthopedic doctors can't find anything wrong with the implant. They sent me to physical therapy, and pain management which neither helped. I can't sit to long, stand to long, walk very far, and stairs are a killer. It's been five years and I'm still in pain everyday. Has anyone else experienced this type of problem? I don't know what to do or where to turn for help.

"Hi, I had a THR on July 18th so I am 3 months post op, I had the added complication that the surgeoun broke my femur in surgery (obviously got a little over excited with the hammer when bashing in the new prosthetic ) anyway my first 6 weeks were spent doing very little as I had to be non weight bearing so I could literally hop around my living room on a zimmer frame and very little else. After 6 weeks I went back and was hoping that Ii would be told that Ii could weight bear, however I was told 50% weight bear for another 6 weeks just to be on the safe side, so I went home and was on crutches for 6 weeks although much more mobile as I could go out and I had no pain whatsoever in my hip, and I could walk way further than I could prior to the op when I couldnt go further than a block or so without being in real pain. So I thought things were going well, however, when I went for the follow up last week the first thing my consultant said was ""why are you on crutches""? I said ""because thats what you told me to do "" he said ""oh, did I...well you dont need those anymore,"" this conversation took place in the corridoor while we were on the way to his consulting room, and he said ""let me see you walk without the crutches"" so I lifted the crutches and took about 10 steps, I was walking like a tellytubby with a severe limpand he said that the physiotherapist would have to teach me to walk again. 
I told him that I had pain in my thigh and I asked if this was because of the break, and he said no its because I have taken away a light piece of bone and replaced it with a heavy hunk of metal, so it is normal that you would get pain there, it will be worse when its cold, but you will get used to it!!!
So, I am at home now, and i, incredibly depressed, I had very bad muscle wastage before the op because I couldnt do much for 3 years prior, and that is even worse post op because I have been doing so little the last 3 months. Now I feel like I may never lose this really bad walking style where I wobble from side to side, I cant go very far, by the time ive ""walked "" a block I need to use my stick because im in pain from my thigh, and I feel like ive exchanged one pain for another (although the pain in my thigh is not as severe as my hip used to be) The whole reason I had the op was to be pain free and have some stamina again to walk distances and not limp ( doc said he had corrected my leg length but limp seems worse now than before) does anybody else have a similar experience, will I be able to walk normally again? without pain? does anybody else have this metal pain? sorry I know theres a lot of questions but I was feeling so positive, and now Im not.

"Hi, Hip friends.
Today I am having a follow-up at 6  months post op with my surgeon because on continuing issues.    I am still worried because I need to have Left hip replacement on my opposite leg and am still not sure that
everything is working properly with my operative leg and won't proceed until Im sure.
So here's the thing.  At 6 months most op, my right side operative leg still has many issues.  First, I still have continuing groin pain especially when I do a little more extensive walking on my operative leg.  I get groin pain even when I carry a small pocketbook on that side.  My thigh still feels tight and refuses to loosen.  I have a hard, knot sensation of pain when I do any of my exercises just below my groin in the beginning of my upper thigh making exercise very uncomfortable.  When I bend my knee, despite my surgeon telling my x-rays of my right knee is normal, and if I bend my knee up towards my chest just a little past 90 degrees, I still experience extreme stiffness in all of my thigh, and even my calf muscle. Exercycling causes pain in the top part of my thigh just below my groin and I feel no incentive to exercise.
I don't know what's normal anymore.  I wonder if an MRI would give me more information if there's something wrong. Can they MRI my entire thigh from groin to knee when I have a metal devise???   I feel like I have not recovered properly and my surgeon just keeps po po'ing me and telling me I need to take a drug that was pulled off the market for being dangerous - - celebrex when I have a history of heart disease with almost all of my family and I'd prefer to aire on the side of caution.
I'm so depressed that my surgery has failed in many ways and may have to do it again..      What could be wrong?
Is there anyone out there with any of these issues at this later stage of recovery?  Would appreciate any comments today before I see the surgeon to compare with others.  Thank you all

I joined another forum and the regulator told me to read posts properly as I had got something wrong and did I know I had spelt codeine wrong ? I said I am 6 days down the line post THR and wanted a bit of support not a spelling lesson ! Cheered on by the posts , esp about the ten days in hospital years ago . Had the OP Saturday 9 am and was out Monday 12 pm but felt nowhere near ready to go . Physio comes into my room and says get up Hazel and I said I cannot move my leg ! Come on now he said and made me .. It was excrutitating . The nurse said grown men cry at that point ! Was confused as do this exercise and do that and all I am thinking is I am in bloody pain I don't really want to move ! Going to read all the posts on here thanks you have helped me .. Much better to listen to those who have experience of it . Don't feel so bad now xx

"After reading in the papers today about a study covering exercise after hip replaement (apparently lots of us aren't increasing our exercise post hip replacement) I thought some of us might like to share our thoughts on this...
At least the study had the good grace to acknowledge that a full hip replacement is done to alleviate pain and not neccessarily to increase exercise and fitness (although many patients do hope and do indeed become very fit again - although I coudn't see this point being made in the study)
My thoughts are ten months on post THP, that you are likely, all being well, to go back to your 'old' life - and if you exercised before you will go back to exercising again, perhaps with added zeal. But if you were not into fitness before, then a hip replacement will not suddenly mean you will be rushing to the gym just because you have had a THP. Also many many patients are older and are not keen on hard core exercise or have other issues to contend with (some are) It is a personal preference.
I feel it would have been a far more interesting study if they had instead found out the stats for those of us that are now completely healed and pain free and leading full lives again, this is a far more valid question. After all this is the point of the operation. I do also wonder why the NHS and other agencies feel they need to 'justify' hip replacements at all, is it not enough for the patient simply to have a pain free life again? Do they need to be doing marathons/going to the gym daily for the operation to be considered a success?

"Hi all.
After having my THR 5 days ago. I am getting the urge to move my leg in ways I cannot do it yet, like crossing it or even raising my knee while lying down. It's a strange feeling because I just cannot raise my Leg at all yet. I know I can't do it yet because it would dislocate my hip, but does anyone else get these urges??
PS I have realised Morphine doesn't take the pain away for me it just intensifies it I think codine works best.

"I asked for your thoughts on spinal or general yesterday and it certainly helped me decide. So the pre-op appt went very well and when asked, I was confident to choose spinal with some sedation. The nurse said I'd made a good choice, she had it herself for a knee replacement and spoke highly of the benefits.   Turns out i'm  not even having removable stitches, my surgeon uses a contniuous thread and steri-strips - hope they're big ones! Only 2 weeks to wait now.

"I have a dilemma.I've had ongoing hip problems for 2 years now.
I had hip arthroscopy 12 months ago, plus several joint injections since. Things are still not great and so have been offered 'another arthroscopy' to address 'SOME' of the problems but not all
I've just got a 2nd opionion and an experienced hip surgeon in my local area said straight away that I need a 'hip replacement'. This was a NHS surgeon so I feel nothing to gain, but it seemed a rather quick decision but it is documented that I have articular cartilage missing on femoral head.
I just feel that I'd like another 'well qualified' person to look at my situation and advise me which way to go. 
My arthroscopy surgeon said my joint is in reasonable condition and it would be a shame to do hip replacement right now, and the second said, it is the only solution and the sooner the better before things get worse. 
Any suggestions/thoughts? I could get another surgeon to take a look, but feel awkward asking for an opinion of which way and who to go to - if they are not going to do the operation!

"Just something positive, 9 weeks post op bi-lateral THR and today I found my comfy trainers were ideal for moving forward.   Have not worn them due to having to wear an ankle brace but heaven this morning.    When I walked across my lounge with my trainers on I did not limp, and did not hold on to anything.  
We went out and visited my mother again no crutches or walking stick it felt good. 
Home for lunch and needed to go to some shops, but by this time I was obviously tired and needed to use my crutches, no pain, just weekness, also my knees decided to scream at me.  
TOday has been a turning point in walking for me all because my trainers were back on my feet, which I had been missing.  I had these trainers for walking before my hips caused a problem because the helped with my knees. 
Now if I carry on improving like this do I take my best friends on holiday as a precaution, or do I leave them at home?   My husband is afraid if I only use one stick it will cause me to favour one side and I need to use both hips equally to recover fully.
What would my fellow hippies think?   Yes to take them as walking around the pool and on the beach could be an issue.... NO leave them at home.... one week to go before I need to decide.
Thank you for your help in my decision.

"Well not had a brilliant week, I have had alot of stress and anxiety and it has sent me backwards... true what they say stress is not good in the healing.
?Mother had a minor Heart Attack on Monday so spent all day in A&E which was like watching paint dry at the speed in which the staff were moving.  My mothers machine went off, showing flatlines, she was asleep at the time and I ended up shouting across the department after several staff had glanced over... ""So flatlining means nothing to you lot then""..... relunctantly someone came over, her connection had fallen off. 
?Then on Tuesday the long awaited results of my husbands scans following 2.5yrs of Cancer treatment, and BANG secondary now in his lungs... Yep no wonder I have gone backwards...  
?I have walked miles around hospital corridors, but not had time to do any exercises and I know I have not stretched myself out enough..
?My mum is back home today so been over getting her place ready!! At 84yrs old they said she was fine to go home. 
?My husband well more test, and then the Oncologist will see him in DECEMBER!! so we have decided we are going off somewhere for some sunshine and relaxation.   Hopefully having a swimming pool for me will get me on the plus side of recovery, and the sun will have a positive affect on us both. 
?I will now have to delay having my knees done, like I did with my hips, but pain and discomfort is not going to kill me, and my husband needs me to be able to drive and look after him..   Do not feel sorry for me we are very positive people and he will fight this like he has done with the Bowel and Liver Cancer.....
?So just to say if you do get stressed then you will go backwards in the recovery like I have, but from tonight I will be doing my exercises and back on the path of getting down to one crutch only.

"Hi
I'm a new hippie having just had a total right hip replacement and am now day 6 of recovery. I got home on Saturday (day4) and so far all is good, maybe too good! I have had someone running after me all weekend but he needs to go to work so I'll be left on my own for a good part of the day.
Do you think it's better to have my days planned out or just see what happens?
I've not to go back to physio for 3 weeks so I think they are expecting me to get on with it. The problem is when I'm doing my exercises all the focus is on the operated leg is this right? I tried to take my weight on it to lift my left leg and realised it wasn't as strong so gave up. Should I be trying to build up the weight on the non operated one or not bother? I need to get this replaced at some point probably same time next year if possible. Anyway I look forward to being part of the group and hearing other people's progress to see if I'm recovering at similar speed

"Like quite a few people I was not automatically offered physio on discharge from the hospital (much to my surprise). Just a booklet which isn't particularly good.
Despite seeing my GP at 8 weeks, and mentioning that I was having some difficulties, nothing was said about receiving physio.
So, imagine my surprise, when on a recent subsequent GP visit, I found out that I could 'self refer' (or in common English - request) physiotherapy.  I duly completed the online form (not difficult, just some fairly ambiguous questions) and started my physiotherapy on Monday.
As I'm now nearly 18 week post op, I'm somewhat miffed that I wasn't made aware of this 'self referral' system.  I could have been receiving needed physio weeks ago!! 
So, if you weren't offered physio, it might be worth investigating to see if your Health Authority is offering it on a 'self referral' basis.
Good luck

"Had a left THR 7 weeks ago and recovery is going really well. No pain, leg feels strong, moving around well. I was told by the surgeon when he looked at my hips that the right one would start bothering me within a year because it looked just as bad. At the time I had no problems with the right hip.
Well, boom, at 3 weeks post op, the right hip started pretty bad. BUT, it's referred pain in the knee. First I thought my knee was shot because it was painful and locking, it the physio tested it and said it was my hip.
So my question is, if my knee is sore and I want to ice it, do I ice my knee or hip? The source of the pain is inflammation in the hip but it doesn't hurt at all. If I'm icing my hip, what part of the hip do I ice because I have no hip pain?

"Hi guys Im 20 days post thr and ive got a couple of questions the first one is does anyone else have like a tingling down the operated leg when standing up its a bit like pins and needles but more severe its not everytime i stand but happened the other afternoon then again this morning when i first got out of bed ??
Secondly re going back to work i know we all heal at different times but i just wanted a rough idea I look after my 2 grandsons full time as my daughter and son inlaw both work full time the boys are aged 2 and 3 and as you can imagine they are a handful my daughter has managed to sort out alternative care for the first 4 weeks of my recovery but she s struggling to find care after that my question is am i going to be well enough after 35 days to start having them again im not sleeping at night as its still too uncomfortable on my back and find im worn out and very sore after just washing a few dishes and pottering round the kitchen. Im worried that it will be too soon to have them ie incase one of them hurts thereself or they need me to bend down i dont want to mess up my recovery or risk breaking my hip precautions. Due to the nature of what I do i wondered if someone could give me an idea of when they think the best and safest time to start having the boys back would be..

"I'm 9 weeks post op and have rcovered really well---walking normally after about 4 weeks and am now driving and carrying on life as normal, without pain. 
I still, however, cannot sleep on my operated side which unfortunately is the side I'm used to sleeping on. As a result, I'm getting very broken sleep as I also can't sleep on my back!
Does anyone have any idea how long it can take before you can sleep comfortably on the operated side--it's strange as I don't have any pain of soreness in the operated area but after just a few minutes sleeping on that side it becomes very uncomfortable.

"Hi, I am new to this group and thought I might get some feed back.  I am 56 and had a r total hip replacement 10/2015,  I was being treated consevatively for 6 yrs (steroid injections) for a congenital slipped capital epiphasis that I apparently had all my life. I changed surgeons 2 months before my surgery date because I wanted to have the anterior approach. the surgery went fine, my recovery was not unusual other than a lot of muscle and nerve pain in my thigh that never let up.  My surgeon told me it was normal and can take up to a year to fully recover from thr.  I also had a very noticiable limp (which I did not have before) and he did not think I had a huge length difference.   Turns out my operative leg is 1"" shorter than the other!  The surgeon sent me to a podiatrist who measured and put me in custom orthotics which still do not help, because I may need a special shoe.  I am so upset and don't know what to do. Has anyone had this issue?

"Hi. I had THR over 4 mths ago. Since then, I have had, and still have a stiffness / soreness and pain in different parts of my hip.I'm aged 55.
Sometimes it is towards the back near the Glutes, sometimes on the side (around where te scar is), sometimes it is in the front at the top.
?I also find it uncomfortable and sometimes get pain when sitting in car / cinema seat formore than 15 mins. I have to wiggle me leg and streatch it to get comfortable.
The Consultant said it is inflamation / tendinitos. I had a Hip Block (cortisone) injection 3 weeks ago but it's no better. He said they would give me another one in a different area. The problem is the pain / soreness / stiffness moves around and is widespread.
?I still take Ibroprofin and Paracetimal but it never disappears. I tend to live with it but I'm getting fed up.
?My consultant told me to stop stretching / exercising as this seemd to make it worse. But it hasn't got any better.

"Hi everyone
I am nine days post op TRH and am so despondent.
I had my left hip replaced last Jan and my leg length both pre and post were equal. However this time I have at least an inch discrepancy. When carrying out my physio, my left leg clears the floor; whilst my right leg scrapes it. When laying flat my left knee is considerably lower than my right.
Unfortunately, my Consultant was on annual leave and unable to perform the procedure. Minutes prior to surgery, I met the Consultant who explained that my hip was ""normal"" and he would therefore only cement the stem but not the ball. I know that the stem used was much longer than the first.
Am I over reacting too soon? My sister, after a hip replacement, was left with a leg discrepancy and she was never able to walk properly again.
I have not seen a physio yet and I am not seeing the Consultant until November.

"I am 6 weeks post op LTHR. Recovery has gone very well physically, mentally tough ( boredom, frustration, cabin fever). I live alone and am wondering how much housework others are able to do at this point.
Cleaning off countertops, cooking and putting things away are fine. Cleaning bathroom counter, sink and toilet are OK. Laundry is hard because it's in the basement so that's 3 trips per load ( one to put laundry in washer, one to change clothes to dryer, third to take out of dryer).
It's the FLOORS! I have dogs so there is alot of hair - everywhere. Vacuuming is exhausting. Getting it out with one hand, carrying it upstairs, moving things out of the way. The floor needs to be mopped so badly but that is way beyond me right now. I have no physical stamina after years of arthritis pain and then the surgery. My hip doesn't hurt but I'm sweating and exhausted after 5 minutes.
Should I keep ignoring my floors for now, hoping in a few weeks I'll be able to do them or do I bite the bullet and hire someone to come in and help?

"Hi all,
New member, long time lurker. I'm 40, I had a non weight bearing 1st stage revision with antibiotic cement and spacer almost 9 months ago due to an injury and infection. The infection cleared up and I was due to have my thr in July (20th). Unfortunately I broke my back, 6 vertebrae on June 3rd due to a seizure (I think coming off my pain meds too eagerly caused it) DISASTER!!
My consultant has decided to wait until 6 months after the break to do my thr.
The reason i'm here is because I'm so down, I can't do anything, I've gained weight and I'm terrified I'm going to damage myself or my fitting.
Thoughts, similar stories or advice would be appreciated.
Thanks all!

"Good morning fellow Hippies,
?Yesterday I was playing at no pain meds all day.. I was okay until late evening, when it was to late to take anything if I wanted to take some before bed..   Took my 2x Tramadol, 2x Paracetamol, and 1 x Naproxin just half hour before bed.
?In bed I tried laying on my left hip and lasted about 30mins, shifted around a bit and got comfortable again and slept for about 1 hr.   Turned with some difficulty on to my right him again getting comfy slept for about 4hrs, then yes you guessed back to sleeping on my back for the rest of the night. 
?Have woken without pain but so stiff, should  I take pain meds this morning or shall I leave them out... I want to go and get my MOP of hair done today so maybe just some ibufon and paracetamol to get me through the journey and sitting in chair having my hair done.  
?On a positive note another corner has been turned for me, and I am seeing more improvement daily, less pain, and now need to practice using my knees to walk.   Unfortunately I am unable to loose the crutches at this time due to having bad knees which are also waiting replacement when I can pluck up the courage to go forward with this.  
?So all you newbies.. have faith the saying is ""no pain, no gain"" and the operation site needs to heal... 
?I am not looking to run, but just have a quality of life pain free, and do things that I have not been able to for several years....
?Just thought I would share to give those just embarking on this journey something positive....  would I recommend this op to anyone suffering YES... had you asked me in week 3/4 it may well have been a different answer.
Have a good day

"I had my hip in February 2015 and had mostly a text book recovery (few niggles but nothing major). I know I need the other side doing at some point but at the moment it's not troubling me. Still doing my exercise, do pilates, use static bike and walk. I'm almost 56 now. So far so good.
However, on a few occasions I have fallen (or tripped and nearly fallen) that it's becoming a concern. Last time was on Saturday on my way to the tube for a night out. It was daylight, dry and the pavement was completely even. I wasn't wearing silly shoes - one minute I was upright the next I was on the ground. Smacked both knees and my forehead on the pavement and hurt my elbow. Hip seems fine. Very shaken and weepy (still). I have bruises everywhere and a black eye. Very embarrassing of course being London no one stopped to help me!
Not really sure what my question is to be honest. Is falling a ""thing"" for hippies? Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do to prevent in future?

"Hello, I thought it would be helpful to talk to others who are going through a hip replacement recovery at the moment. Feeling very down. Its seems alot of people feel this way after hip replacement.
I was born with hysplasia, discovered when i was ten. Have surgrey but it was unsucessful.I have spend the last 23 years with pain and a limp. I didnt have any more surgrey because I was so young and advised by docotor. Have any of you had hip dysplasia? the wear and tear of living with an unsuccessful treatment of this required me to get very early replacement. The hip was so bad. I notice that pain is gone now. 
I am very anxious about getting back to walking, hopefully without a limp. 6 weeks with touch bearing weight is tough. I am going back to work ( sit down job) on monday but its all very scary. what is your experience with physio? any one else gone through this?

"I am almost 7 weeks post op for bilateral hip replacements. Last week I thought I was doing well. I was walking around my flat without crutches and also drove my car a couple of times. However the last few days I have a very painful lower back which makes walking upright difficult. I am back on crutches. Sleep is also evading me and after only 3 hours sleep last night I am now getting hives which are making me very irritable. I also seem to be losing more hair than usual. This I noticed immediately after the op. Are these problems to be expected and will I be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel very soon?
I thought the worst was over but things went downhill after my 6 week discharge.

"Hey one and all
A lot of you will know me and a lot of you will be quite new to forum and you count just as much.
I have been a member of this forum for over a year now l think and l just stumbled upon it when l found out l needed both hips replaced. There is not a day goes by l don't think about how lucky l was to find it. It got me through 2 hip repacements the good and bad times and l met loads of great people some who have become friends for life.
I urge all the new people not to give up on this forum as its the thing.that helped me the most was speaking to people who understood what l.was going through and could help with anything. As much as you might have a supportive family nobody really unerstands ou apart from other hippies. People think ater a few months you are healed as you look ok on the outside but unfortunatly inside it takes a lot longer to heal. I would not change my new hips for anything, l know its not the same for everyone and some of you have had complications and went through hard times again thats where this forum is here for support. .
I was getting on great after my 2 hip replacements and then unfortunatly my knees started getting sore and found out l needed to new knee's as well. Well it made me feel l was a 43 year old with a 70 year old body. It pulled me back into a bad place and l tried the knee forum but could not setttle at 1st as l.have always been on the hip forum.and new everyone but liz (lizard) was going through same and had joined the knee forum and eventually you see its just the same as the hip forum its just that l new everyone on the hip forum and it was always going to have a place in my heart.
I have had my 1st knee replacement and jeeze people were not joking when they said it was a lot harder than the hip. I am 7 weeks post op and decided l am taking a break from.surgery for as long as l can half a year or a year hopefully if my knee holds out as that was honestly the hardest operstion l have endured. Altjough it will hopefully be worth it and it will not stop. me from.getting my other done when needs be.
I start back work on monday so won't be on as much but l will.never leave alltigether.. but honestly guys its the best place for anyone going through thr's and l hope you all get as much help and comfort and frienship as l have from peo5ple from all over the world. I never thought l would take to something like this as l am not really a social media type but this is something diffrent for people of all ages from 17 to 80 we all share the same experiences.i hope you get as much out it as l do.
Good luck to all of you thats still to go through it and them that have just been through it. Remember nothing is taboo to talk about as there is a lot of things that comes with hip.replacements and l.would say Rocket and Renee are like the mum.and dad of the forum. They are brilliant and its always good to get a laugh along the way.
Thanks to everyone

"I was the only one home at the time and managed to get down two flights of stairs and out by myself.
It happened saturday. We lived in a hotel for a few days and just rented a house and moved in yesterday. Needless to say I over did it and am feeling it today. My physical therapist was supposed to visit while we were moving from the hotel to the house so I had to cancel.
My teenage daughter's rooms were upstairs and they ended up losing everything.
The outpouring of help from the community has been amazing but I have felt so helpless watching everyone work while I couldn't do much. At least no one was hurt and the girls are taking it ok. Things are chaotic over here right now but at least we have a roof over our heads. Not to sort through everything and try to get rid of the soot, ash, and smoke smell.
I have my follow-up appointment with the surgeon on friday with x rays. I just need some rest now.

I'm back at work but can any suggest anything I can use on my desk chair to help ease the pain?

No doubt, there are far more earth shuttering things out there, but for me it was upsetting. I don't think if I had known in advance would have made me not go through with it, I just don't like surprises. Another issue was I knew that six months later I was going in for back fusion (L4,L5,S1) and the unevenness was throwing my back off to this day.

"I have a vasovagal response a couple of months ago, and passed out, and fell backwards.  My first concern was the hip replacement I had 4 months earlier, but the ER doctors weren't concerned at all, neither were the two doctors I saw after the ER.  I had a concussion and vertigo, and was very thankful there seemed to be no problem with my hip, even though it hurt.  As I have been recovering from the vertigo and head injury, my surgical leg has been hurting more and more, especially as I put more weight on it or stand for a longer time.  I started vestibular rehab this week for the vertigo, and the PT suggested I contact the doctor immediately to get xrays on my leg.  I had xrays today, and the ortho said the implant appears to still be intact with no movement, however, he is ordering a bone scan because he is suspecting I may have a femur fracture and possibly another fracture in the ilium crest.  
I'm wondering if anyone on this site has experienced anything like this, and if so, what the treatment was, other than just allowing healing time.

Unfortunately, my company sent me home until I could get a full release from my doctor. I asked the nurse for a full release and she graciously granted me with one. Everything has been great until today. I am suddenly having sharp pains in my groin area and around my scar area. I don't see my doctor for another couple of weeks. Can anyone tell me if they have     experienced this and if it's normal? I can't afford to take off work again and I'm fearful that I've done way too much.

"Hi all,
Haven't been here in a while as I spent some time in the local hospital on an emergency visit last Thurs, and was in until Saturday.  My heart started beating out of my chest for no reason on Thurs afternoon, and at first I thought it may just be a 'temporary' thing, and would go away.  After an hour of this I called my primary and he sent me (and hubby) off to the ER pronto.  They classified it as Atrial Fibrilation (A Fib for short) and it took them hours to bring it under control with intervenous meds, then sent me up to intensive care unit on a constant drip of meds to keep it that way.  On Friday, they did every test imaginable concerning heart, lungs, blood testing, etc. and could find NOTHING.  No blood clots anywhere either.  A real relief at least to know nothing concretely wrong with heart, lungs, blood tests etc, but a MISERABLE and SCARY experience all and all.  Now........I am not only on my one mild blood pressure med, but a 'beta blocker' and a prescription blood thinner as well.  The cardiologist that I saw in the hospital said it absolutely had nothing to do with the recent surgery, but I am by no means buying that one.  I had a very small episode with the same thing 2 days out of surgery, but it went away in 5 minutes, so I thought not much of it.  Now, upon putting two and two together, the one short episode and the one that lasted an hour before going to the ER a week later, I pretty much KNOW it's surgery related.  Have never in my life had anything like it before.  So........upon googling A Fib after surgery, it is right up there as one of the main risk factors.  Nice little ditty that I had no idea about before I went in, and especially for those with high blood pressure.  I guess I didn't do enough research before opting for the surgery, I don't know.  I am beyond down, as now I have to be even more careful about when to take my vitamins etc so as not to interact with so many meds I'm now on.  My 2nd stay in the hospital was at first kind of a nightmare, as I had to wait in the ER on those primitive beds for 8 hours before they found me a room in intensive care.  And.....of course they wouldn't let me leave until they knew what was happening, so by the time I got to my room I was in MUCHO PAIN, mainly I think because of the position I was in for so long, after being so new after surgery.  They did give me a small dose of morphine once I got to the room, and it helped tremendously, but what a TOTAL NIGHTMARE, not to mention missing a few days of exercise etc!!!!  I got a total of two hours of sleep that night, as the charge nurse had to get medical history, so was up until 2:00 am and they woke me up again at 4:00am for blood work.  This recovery is turning into more than I bargained for.  Sorry to be so negative, but at this point, frankly, I'VE HAD IT!!!  That said I do hope all of you are doing well with your recovery process.

"Hi there,
I am 3 and a half weks post op, I am 45.  I have felt very possitive since my op and progress has been fabulous.  I am taking it steadily keeping up with my physio and walking a and resting in reasonable proprtions.  I have a 6 year old boy to manage too, so am being very careful not to over do it! Taking up offers from lovely friends and family members to help with him.
I have never had such major surgery before so am unfamiliar with the feeling of the wound healing and tissues reapairing around it.  My wound has healed beautifully and looks clean, I had a cut alond the line of my hip aprox 24cm, I am only 5ft 1, so it looks pretty large on me.  Below the line of the scar the skin feels sensitive and the muscles or tissues below it are really tight to touch and feel.  The surface feels a bit like sunburn, not hot but just the level of sensitivity.  Does anyone know how long tis takes to feel normal again?  I love readding all the posts, its so reassuring and great to feel amongst others with similar issues.

"I had my six week review today (actually at seven).
My consualtant has removed nearly all of the restrictions, so I can drive, swim, cycle etc again and I can get rid of the raised toilet seat.
I still have to walk with a stick for the time being, as due to lack of use for five months prior to the op, my left leg is still a bit weak.  Also in part due to the type of operation I had, which was a lateral-posterior approach (due to a previous attempt to repair my hip).
I still have to obey the 90 degree rule, which he said is forever.  There is a 1 in 600 chance of a dislocation, which if it did happen would do more damage to an already weakened area.
I am bit disheartened to hear that I will still have restricted movement, as it doesn't make tieing my shoes any easier.  I still have to get help from my wife.

"Hi I'm new here and wondering if anybody is having similar problems that I'm having. I was injured at work April 2nd 2012. My left hip was replaced June 8th 2012 and my right replaced July 10th 2012. My recover was fast, extremely fast. I was jumping off 10 and 15 ft cliffs into the river 10 days after my first hip. And about 2 weeks after my 2nd hip. I never used a walker and only used a cane for a few days with each hip. About 4 months after my last hip was done i started to have low back pain all the time that gradually got worse as the weeks passed. Eventually it got so bad that I can't sleep, can't walk very far or stand in one place very long. Like more then 5 minutes standing in one spot I have to sit down. I'm getting a neurostimulator implant on October 13th because I also developed bad nerve pain in both legs. The trial was successful but only kills the leg pain. Doesn't do much for my low back pain. I never had problems with my back until after my replacements. MRI doesn't tell much of anything is wrong. Scar tissue did grow around my sciatic nerves in my hips though. I hated to do it but I had to file for disability which is still pending. Has anybody else run into the same problem with extreme low back pain like I have?

"5 years ago I had total hip replacement and the well-regarded surgeon made the leg too short and I've had nothing but grief since. I walked around for 70 years with that leg longer and never knew it.
I went through all kinds of physical therapy, etc. and some things helped,but I've never been able to walk normally and there has been discomfort more or less the entire time. I have high pain tolerance and just block things out frequently.
Now there is some looseness of the stem starting. The orthopedic doctor I talked to this week said maybe he could get some length on the leg, but didn't address the pending stem looseness and I won't have surgery unless that is also taken care of since I don't want to return for yet another surgery.
I'm walking with a cane to keep pressure off the hip. I have used a recumbent bike for exercise but wonder it that might not stress the stem stability so have stopped doing that for now.
I live alone and will have to arrange for my big dogs and other animals so surgery is no small thing.

"2 years 9 months after my first THR I have been given a revision by another consultant at a different hospital. I cannot say whether or not all of the problems have been sorted -  but so far so good.
I chose to go to the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre - NHS hosptial - in Oxford under the care of Roger Gundle, after numerous bungles at my local hospital.
I cannot speak highly enough of the care I received - the staff are brilliant and have time to care, the food is the best NHS food ever and the consultant team were excellent.
Such a different outcome from the first second opinion I got which was ""I bow to the greater knowledge of your consultant. You will have to put up with the constant pain - as if we operate you will probably end up in a wheelchair"". Harsh words to hear at 52 after being active and healthy all my life.
They have sorted out the leg length difference and also the offset - that made my hip stick out and up - by 7mm. For the first time since Dec 2013 I stand equally upright on both legs and my hips are level. All good. There was scar tissue and inflamed tendons and everything has been stretched by 7mm. As my consultant said - I have gone from being wonky to slack and have to be v careful due to high risk of dislocation as everything stretched needs to tighten up again.
Due to the length of time I have been left my body is going to take a while to readjust to being right ways up again. My other hip and back continue to grumble. I cant wait to get back to my physio. I have also had my other hip replaced in the meantime.
So my life has been on hold as I have been unable to drive more than 5 miles or sit and work since Dec 13.  Scared of how much improvement I will get as this was probably my last shot.
With the post operative blues I could do with some words of encouragement - any other revisions out there?  All they did was swap the ball for a bigger one and put in a new liner and reduce the offset - so nothing bony.  
Also I wanted to share this story for people who are putting up with a poor outcome - I found 2 consultants who agreed within 5 minutes of reviewing me of the need to revise. This was after I had seen the first ""wheelchair"" second opinion. So I wanted to let you all know - its worth perservering if your hip replacement outcome has been poor.

" Six weeks post total hip replacement revision nonweightbearing. 
Hello new friends, I have just joined this group! I have a very long history of many hip surgeries,  this most recent surgery, (6 weeks ago) a revision of my right total hip replacement which was originally done five years ago. I have been recovering at home with a walker and a hospital bed, because of a total non-weight-bearing protocol for the first five weeks post surg.  Was cleared by my surgeon last week to begin physical therapy this week. In past experience I know that it will be another 4 to 6 weeks until full weight bearing and resuming walking with one crutch or a cane. 
 The careful protocol is because of the bone damage, necessitating 3 screws into the pelvis to secure the new implants. 
 wondered if anyone else in this group has had similar experiences and would be willing to share. I'm getting discouraged and frustrated, with the lack of mobility as well as the ongoing pain of recovery. PS I have a posterior incision at the same site of the previous incision to replace that h with the lack of mobility as well as the ongoing pain of recovery. PS I have a long posterior incision at the same site of the previous incision to replace that hip.

"Hi everyone, this is my first discussion.  I'm due to have LTHR Friday 7thy October.  My white cells are slightly higher than the norm.  I feel great appart from the pain I'm getting from my dodgy hip.  In an NHS hospital, there is no problem operating on someone with a white count of 12.4, but I'm due to have my surgery at a place that only works to keep down NHS waiting lists & they do this on behalf of the NHS.  Their criteria is very tight.  I'm having a further test this Thursday & if it's still higher than 11, the surgery will be cancelled.  I've been advised to increase my intake iof water as this will help flush out any infection I may yhave.  As i've said though, I feel grear appart from the bone on bone pain from my left hip.  Anyone else ever come across this?

"renee01952  suggested I start a new thread to tell people about me, although I'm not sure anyone will be all that interested. I know I'm not!
?So, about three/four years ago the occasional ache in the hip became more than a niggle so I thought I would probably have to do something about it. Long story short, leaving behind a useless GP (who I hadn't noticed was useless on the grounds that I never went to the GP before!), various bits of me started breaking down so that I started 2017 with severe OA in both hips (touch wood, the right one not so far given any problems), a touch of OA in the right ankle (not sure about the left - I have given up MRI's and X-rays on bits that don't hurt because I just don't want to know!), and spinal stenosis from OA in the spine. And gout (a few very bad flares but relatively far apart- three in four years). So 2016 hadn't been a great year and I had discussed the fact that I'd need to start thinking about the THR of the left hip - it was getting worse and worse, and treatments that worked fewer and fewer.
?Remind me never to say, ""thank goodness that year is over, the next one can't be so bad""!  
?In May I had a bad attack of gout that just didn't seem to clear up. After four weeks of walking around in pain (did I mention, stubborn person? Won't give in?) I decided to go to the GP. Yep, straight to hospital, came back with a cast, crutches, unable to drive for weeks - and everyone asking how on earth I walked around for four weeks on a broken ankle! So... major panic stations for the doctors as (a) you shouldn't walk around on a broken ankle for four weeks and (b) I actually really didn't do anything at all to break it - no falls, no bangs, no traumas (which would be why I hadn't realised it was broken!). Even more perplexed doctors when a bone density scan shows that my bone density is even better than it should be at my age (a very youthful 59 tomorrow). So, never mind, it will be better before I spend my birthday exploring Mayan ruins in September....

There then followed three days of hell. No, not the hip. Three days of hell with what may be the worst NHS ward in the country. Where I was routinely deprived of the pain meds that I was admitted with (in other words - the ones that didn't do too well BEFORE my hip got suddenlt worse), and where the nursing staff routinely patronise, lie to, and bully the patients. This sounds like bad news, doesn't it? It was. For the staff. Did I mention stubborn? To mention nothing of the fact that my working background uniquely qualifies me to cause maximum chaos with minimum effort in such places! Although I now have notes on my medical records saying that I am never to be admitted to or treated at that hospital again - I'll go anywhere in the UK expect there!
?After three days I was moved to another ward when they figured out the problem - osteonecrosis. It wasn't there in February. Now it is very bad. So bad that the consultant would have operated immeditaely had it not been for the fact that my opposing ankle is broken and I need it for weight bearing....Okaaay....
?Two weeks later, get out of cast, not walking good but what can you expect? Except for, something doesn't seem right. Right ankle wise. And that would explain the break - the tendon in the ankle is damaged (and I probably never had gout - it was probably ths tendon starting to go), and may need surgery but... And yes, you have got there. They can't do surgery on the ankle because I need surgery urgently on the hip!
?So here I am. I am not in Mexico exploring the ruins at Uxmal for my birthday, about which I am most p****d off! My THR is 8th November, which is the date the consultant came up with as a balance between doing it before it is too damaged, and the ankle having enough strength not to break again. I am fed up to the back teeth of crutches, which are the only thing that get me around, and not that well either now - a couple of hundred feet, and that is at a good time of day, is all I can manage.
?And I thought I was well-prepared and looking forward to it until I started reading the posts here, but having read so many tales of woe, I'm beginning to get worried! Oh, and that whole being awake when it is done thing too - that wouldn't have been my first option. Or my second... or my one thousand, three hundred and twenty-ninth....

"Hi hippies
I'm waiting for a surgery date, which will be some time in October. I'm not worried about having a L THR because I've already been through an arthroscopy (unfortunately unsuccessful in alleviating any pain) and that's a similar operation so I know the aftermath isn't very nice. However this time I'm confident that eventually I'll be pain (and painkiller!) free after over two years of suffering and having to give up everything I like doing.
My question is: do any of you have experience of going back to horse riding or running after surgery? My surgeon is a runner himself and has said that slow running on soft surfaces - grass or trails - will be ok but I should avoid road running. I've seen on another site stories of people going off and doing ultra marathons after THR - what do people think?

Think the damaged happened trying to in and out of bed but all the swelling kept the effects hidden until last few days.
Back on my high dose had a lovely cat nap and woke without pain in my hip....

"Interesting to hear everyone's issues post THR.  I had my left hip replaced 3 yrs. ago and have had pain in that joint ever since (currently 53 yrs. old).  The pain becomes very intense post work outs.  Making it hard to stay in shape and loose weight if working out brings on pain.  The pain is primarily in the replaced joint, can be a continuous throbbing or a bolt of lightning.  A heating pad or ice pack seem to help, but I didn't intend on getting hip replacement surgery to continue to be in lifelong pain. Now that I see I'm not imagining this issue, through your inputs, it's time to see a doctor and discuss the proposed nerve deadening procedure (if this is the root cause).

"I'm 56 years old. I'm planning to have bilateral hip replacement done in December. I currently have cortisone injections in both hips about every 90 days for arthritis. The injections help but last less and less. I'm nervous about surgery but also excited about feeling better and not needing injections anymore. I'm a NICU nurse and the 12 hour shifts are exhausting. The reason for waiting until December for surgery is to have more sick time built up at work and to have my husband off from work for a while to help. He works in school transportation so Winter break makes it possible to be off a bit. I'm interested in finding out from anyone who has had this surgery anything that would be useful for recovery at home. Any other input regarding your own experience would be appreciated. Thank you

"Some of you may remember that in May 2015 I had a THR at age 44 due to OA from a ten year hip fracture.  Anyway just throught it useful to update you all on how the hip feels now after a decent amount of recovery time.  In short it is nothing short of miraculous!  Seriously I cannot believe how good the hip is - so good in fact that I do not even thing that I have a hip replacement - it simply never crosses my mind really.
When I think about what I have achieved in the last year it brings it home how much of a fantastic job my surgeon did - for example I have been away camping twice (including a two week stint just 12 weeks post op!), dug out the garden for my pool, built numerous raised beds for our allotments, shovelled tons of stones in wheelbarrows, put up stud walls in my fathers garage/workshop etc etc.  Not a peep from the hip but plenty of muscular aches as I put into action muscles that have not been used for a long time.
Seriously if you are in your younger years and keep putting it off as you feel it maybe better to wait as long as you can - don't.  Get it done ASAP so you can enjoy life while you are still young enough to.
Good luck to everyone due to have a THR in the near future - no doubting the recovery is tough but stick at it and the rewards are so worth it.

"Hello to all you fine folks out there!! Well 4 more days after today that will mark my 6 weeks non weight bearing!! I see surgeon on Wednesday! My question is if anyone else out there had to be non weight bearing for this long? And if so, after the 6 weeks were up how was it to finally put weight on that leg? I've been doing lite toe touch and putting my whole foot down but no weight. I feel tingling like its asleep, sometimes pain on heel. I've been having my husband rub that foot and some areas make me jump it's like a shock!! My foot swells and gets cold. Sometimes swelling is up into calf. Will this resolve itself once I can start walking?? I also get a tight tingling sensation just below ankle, like where ankle & foot meet. Im so scared and worried. I have been depressed crying every day several times a day! I keep telling myself I'm down to the last week, but I'm just about giving up because I just don't know if I can take much more!! If anyone has some info on this from past experience, it would be greatly appreciated. I will of course address this with dr. Thank you!

What I do find is that my hip and back are often stiff when I get up.  It seems to make no difference whether I have done my exercises or not.  I also find that if I overdo it, I am getting back pain by the end of the day.  Hopefully this will reduce over time.
I see my consultant on the 30th, so hopefully I can start to drive again and get rid of the crutches.

"Hi,
I had my 2nd THR at the end of January so thats more than 6 months ago.
I had accepted that I couldnt get into the bat for 6 weeks {same as my first THR} but 4 weeks into recovery I fracture myr greater trochanter bone and was told there was nothing they could do, it would heal its self but would take a long time. They discovered I had osteoporosis and that is why it fractured so easily.
6 and a half months since my THR 5 and a half since the fracture and I'm finding it difficult to get into the bath {or more to the point to get out of it LOL}
I have a thing about showers.....do not like them and ours is very tiny so its always been a bath for me.
Any tips  HELP PLEASE......The best I can do is sit on a bath board with feet and the lower part of my legs in the bath and do it from there.....it is not nearly as good as a soak.
The OT but a bar on the wall beside the bath but if I try to pull myself out my hand just slips down it.
Its my left hip bone that is so sore and being on crutches still I cant put a lot of weight on it so thats another problem getting out.
Sorry for the ramble but I'm so fed up with this and someone might have some ideas

"Hi All,
I had the anterior approach left hip replacement surgery on 14th Feb 2014 in France. I am 52 mother of 3, youngest 7. I lived in pain for three years and was told by Kings they would review for the op in two years sentencing me to two more years of pain. I even left my job as a social worker (of twenty three years with a London LA) I couldn't sit for prolonged periods without extreme pain, couldn't walk at all some days.
I took matters into my own hands and researched and found a company that offered private surgery in France at a nominal fee as the hospital claims back the rest on the EHIC. I took the plunge and went in trepidation, well what a surprise. A magician for a surgeon or what! I had the anterior approach I had the ceramic, titanium hybrid plastic (not the Johnson Johnson one!) as advised I could do impact sports eventually as the plastic cushions the hip joint. I was put in a hotel (all transfers etc) had all my tests completed in one day, urine, blood, x-rays the lot and met the consultant who took me through the details of the op. The next day I was in having the op biff, baff, bosh!
Well, well, well! Contrary to all my fears I was up the day after surgery, able to walk without a stick in 3 days; no lie! I even went to the shops sneakily to stock up on fruit and nuts as was constipated after the surgery. I was visited daily by the consultant and the guy from the company who brought me chocolate, water etc, the nurses were an absolute delight. I only stayed six nights although seven nights was the package, but wanted to see the kids and felt well enough too.
I, of course take a stick out as a support just now, but no limp etc, but happily use nothing at home. Stopped taking pain killers after 5 days, did take a pain killer last night, as had been on my feet for four hours. No problem bending either with the anterior approach, as very little risk of dislocation. Putting on my left sock or tight a bit of a nuisance getting on, so not quite able to do gymnastics yet!
If anyone out there is living in pain and has a diagnosis and needs the op but the NHS is reluctant and uses excuses like you are too young etc, my advice is get ahead and do it make sure it is the anterior approach though.
If you want to contact me and I will give you the low down exactly about my French experience. To say it was a breeze is a bit cheeky but I had a great experience and could not recommend highly enough.

"Hello, I've only just joined this forum but have already had some interesting discussions!
I'm due to have a Hip Replacement operation in the next few weeks (just waiting for a date) and having read quite a lot about the procedure and people's experience afterwards I have a question about post-operative pain.
I've been in constant pain for two years now, originally because of a deformed hip (a cam and pincer on the hip joint) coupled with arthritis, then only moderate, which didn't respond to an arthroscopy operation last year. I've read some literature on chronic pain and understand it to mean that our brains become programmed to feel pain, even when the source of the pain is no longer present. I'm just wondering if anyone has read anything about the connection - I suppose I'm concerned that I may still experience pain after the operation and after I've healed from it, because my brain is wired that way now?
Any thoughts?

"This is an amazing support group and I have been enriched reading your comments.
But....I need to know if there is anyone out there in THR land that has suffered a femoral nerve palsy from your THR and had five blood transfusions to boot....during and for two weeks after the surgery? 
Im looking for statistics now. I personally can't find any of these complications...especially on an otherwise healthy patient going into surgery.
Please shout out if you can relate to this or know of someone who has suffered permanent femoral nerve damage from THR!!

"Hi all. I am now 10 weeks post op and started back at work today on a phased return at 50% normal hours for the next 4 weeks. I was welcomed back with open arms which felt very good. I stayed more than my 3.5 hours as I was trying to sort out the Christmas party. It felt good to be back (I felt ready) but a little tired now. Could do with going to bed, but we are staying over at friends tonight. Thank you for all the support I have had from this forum. Good bye for now, Joanne

"Hi hippies,
    I had my left hip done 1 year ago and my right hip done 5 months ago and I'm pretty active and mobile but I'm still using medicine (either Celebrex (anti-inflamatory) or Tylenol) pretty much every day and I do get a fair amount of pain.  Any walk more than about 0.5 km and I'll defininately feel it although I can probably walk up to 5 km without too much trouble (although I'll be quite sore and stiff during the walk).  In all fairness, I really haven't been that diligent about doing my exercises since the 2nd operation (and didn't get any physio at all since I didn't want to pay the co-pay).  I do get quite sore after sitting for an extended period of time (e.g. watching TV) or lying down for a long time (e.g. very sore first thing in the morning) although curiously enough, a lot of the pain is in my knees rather than my hips.
I'm just wondering how others are doing and what's the typical recovery time (my surgeon pretty much doesn't say anything other than everything looks good) until the hips are completely pain free (or if that's unrealistic and there will always be some degree of pain). 
Let us know. Thanks,
Mike

"a friend had the Amis total hip replacement, and recommended it. So I've been researching online. I discovered there was a surgeon operating in Wrexham, called Mr James Wootton. he was highly recommended by lots of patients and had invented a special table, with his engineer brother, to better perform the operation. However, when I called the Spire in Wrexham, they told me they no longer do that operation and Mr Wootton left 18 months ago.
Does anyone know where he might be ?

"I wanted to share something that helped with my last THR five years ago. I used a silicone patch to reduce the scarring and it really worked. I ordered a new patch (Scar Fix from Ebay) and will apply it as soon as all the glue residue is gone from my wound site. (I am in the US and had the anterior apporach so my recovery is much different from what most of you are encountering, but I do understand as my left hip was done as a posterior approach.)

"Hello!  I need to have a THR as my hip is completely bone on bone.  I've had pain in my knees for almost 20 years (getting consistently worse) because the hip bone is resting on some nerves.  However, I am now getting pain in my rear end and very lower back on the side of my bad hip.  Do you have any suggestions on how to alleviate this nerve pain?  I've gotten used to my knee pain, but the back pain is harder to deal with.  I plan on getting my THR late this year or early next year.  Thanks for any suggestions at all!

"No, it's not that, you dirty-minded people.
After my surgery, I worried about exercising. I walk every day even a little, but still wanted something else. I spend a lot of time at my computer desk. I purchased a set of bicycle wheels that I substituted for my underdesk footrest. I pedal a lot when at the computer. I don't even think about it really. I has helped so much. The wheel set was cheap. I bought mine from eBay. Amazon and even some physical stores also have them.
It was a great investment in my recovery.

Went for my 8 weeks check yesterday with surgeon. He is very pleased with my progress. Lifted restrictions. Well after removing raised toilet seat it feels as if I am sitting on the floor is so low. Think exercises are paying off as have strength to stand up unaided.
I think couldn't sit on floor of Bath but had bought a 8 inch bath stool to stand in Bath. Ran lovely deep bath with lots bubbles. What bliss to sit in water after 8 weeks of strip washing. Bit of struggle to get up but so worth it.
Back to work tomorrow for few hours a day.

"Hello everyone
Don't know if this has been mentioned before but I downloaded this free app - Simply Walking. It is brilliant - for me - anyway. I use it for my walks outside as it shows you how many steps you have taken, how far you have walked, what speed and how long it has taken and how many calories you have used (based on your weight which is simple to add).
I have found this very motivating.
It shows charts of your progress and a map of your route and you can check previous routes you have taken.
The only thing it doesn't do is add together daily totals if you do more than one walk in a day so I contacted the developer and he is going to include daily, weekly and monthly cumalitive totals to the charts.
It makes me want to go and see how I've improved and today I walked 2.5 miles at 2mph.
I am 3 weeks post right hip replacement and am walking outside with one crutch and inside without at times.

I hope others find it reassuring.
sending you all my good wishes for your recovery, whatever stage you are at.

I don't mean generally walking around, but if you had to walk 5 metres at a pinch would you have been able to with a normal gait?
I am currently just over two weeks, have been getting stuck into the physio, pain has gone, I am off pain killers and everything is tracking a long well with the exception that I just can't walk. I can only hobble.
Is this normal for day 17? I am concerned that this is permanent and that I will have a pain free but hobbling hip.

"Hi everyone,
I finally had my review appointment on Monday as it had been cancelled, so it became a 9 week review instead of six. Anyway, I didnt see the surgeon who did my LTHR he must have been one of the registrars, he was nice enough though, he only seemed interested in my scar healing and didnt want to discuss my surgery at all.  I asked him ""what was my hip packed with"" he became very vague so I had to rephrased it to ""a problem occured with something the surgery team didnt expect so what was my hip packed with"", oh you had a bone cyst and  graft he told me. He then asked me if I was back to normal things when I said the fact that I would normally walk 3 miles to the swimming pool, swim 40/50 lenghts and walk home again, so no I'm not, right he said well, they did a lot in your surgery. I am so disappointed with the appointment i  was only with him about 5 minutes,he didnt want to discuss or answer anything.

"Hi All.  I'm looking for some advice as I don't know how to best deal with this. My mum is 75 and is struggling to walk only a few steps because both of her hips need replacing.  We have recently seen an NHS consultant who has been very empathetic and not at all pushy who has explained to her her situation, her poor bone density and the rapid deterioration of her hips.  All the family are so dreadfully worried about her.  Her quality of life has deteriorated massively over the last 18 months and we are all petrified of her slipping and falling as she now only shuffles around and can barely walk.  The pain, at times, I know is unbearable for her and yet she is resisting going for the operation for her first hip.  We are all really concerned for her quality of life but also the impact that this will have on those that are around her.  My Dad is finding her increasingly difficult to live with and we are all worried that what is left of her life, she will spend sitting in a chair or worse she will become so riddled with pain she will end up unable to walk.  I don't want to sound as though I am a bully because I totally understand that anyone who would be facing such an operation would be fearful and full of anxiety and I don't want to coerce her into anything.  But, I feel she has'nt fully considered her decision not go ahead with this operation.  I really want to hear both sides of this arguement/debate and would appreciate any comments that anyone has.

"My wife and I are hoping to go on holiday to Mauritius in November (long haul flight fromUK)--by then I will be approximately 13/14 weeks from my THR. I'm recovering well (I'm 4 weeks now and walking without sticks) and I fully expect to be given clearance to drive etc at my 6 weeks check up in 2 weeks time.
I'm aware that despite the all clear I will still have to be careful for some time about bending and sitting down, sleeping, playing golf and, I assume, lifting heavy objects.
With that in mind will I be able to carry a 20kg suitcase when we go on holiday in November--for example, putting the case into the car/taxi, lifting it onto the scales at the airport etc etc. My wife isn't able to do this for me so I'm not sure what's going to happen if I am restricted at what I can lift and carry.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

The MAJOR problem is I development drop foot. When I went in for my check up and I asked him why is it so painful to touch the top of my feet and he said I had sciatic nerve damage. He said he called the physician that trained him and heｭｭｭｭｭｭｭｭｭ and was told it only happened to him once in his entire career. I don't care about how many times it took the other patient to gain feeling about, he should have consulted me on what was going on. To make thing worse he said it could take 14 months or more before I regain feeling back.
He said it like I have no job. I'm a realtor so my career depends on me driving. When I told him that he said he will do some more research to see if there is another solution. I'm very upset because his life is going on while i'm stressing about how my kids tuition will get paid, thanksgiving ,and

The other option he has is having his hip fused but we do not honeslty think that is the best option as he already has very limited mobility and that will just make it even worse.
Of course I am very worried (as his mum) but at the same time I want him to have some of his life back, he has really missed out on a lot.
He has to make the decision on what to do, if he decides to have the hip replacement then he will have it done at Stanmore.

"Hi folks.
I just found this forum and I'm hoping to get some support and objective opinions. I hope this is not too long-winded.
I'm 41 years old and I've been heavy all my life. No serious health problems, though I've always known it would catch up with me. I had weight loss surgery 13 years ago and lost nearly 200 lbs and hit a wall when I got pregnant with my son and still had 100 lbs to go on a weight loss goal. I started having severe pain in my hip/groin about 2 years ago and after 2 orthopedic consults, x-rays and MRIs, I finally got a 3rd opinion (WHY it took 3 I have no idea) but my 3rd ortho dianosed me with Cam & Pincer FAI. The labrum was shredded almost completely. Because of my age and weight, the ortho recommended the scope, saying if I opted for the hip replacement, I would likely need another before the end of my life and it wouldn't be pretty the 2nd time around. Better to have the scope, hope for the best outcome and worst case scenerio, put off a full replacement 10 years if I could.
The debridement of the impingment was apparently successful in that I have a healthy looking bone and no spurs but I am 4 months out and have severe pain 100% of the time. No muscle strength whatsoever and I have been doing PT twice a week for 4 months. I have done everything right. There is just a ridiculous amount of damage that the joint has suffered in the last few years. My weight, the FAI, and the scope have made this joint very angry.
I went for a follow up with my ortho this week and he agreed that the scope was not likely positive and I had become a ""statistic"" of someone that unfortunately had a bad result and that a replacement would be my only relief from pain. He then explained to me that my weight presents SEVERE risks for this replacement, given where I carry it. (Weight loss surgery patients tend to shed weight and it falls heavy around their hips, like fabric draping.) He was kind and understanding of my situation and my struggles of being almost COMPLETELY unable to move and I don't eat a ton of food (because I can't.) So shedding a lot of weight in order to diminish risk before a replacement isn't likely. Can anyone give me some positive thoughts here? I've been an optimistic person my entire life and never EVER struggled with depression.

"Hi Hippies,
I am 9 days post op and things are going pretty well. One thing I have noticed is that my operated leg feels longer than my other one. I have read that as my recovery progresses and everything tightens up this should resolve itself.
Has anyone had this experience?
Also this next bit is very strange and may just be attributable to the pain killers, but for the first 48 hours at times I would be lying in bed with my eyes shut and when I opened them my legs would be entirely different positions than I thought they would have been. Like when you close your eyes you have a mental image of where you limbs are. This would be totally out of whack.

"How long did everyone stay in hospital after their op?
I was only in for four days and three nights after my hip replacement. I only managed to stay at home one day before being readmitted due to a hospital acquired infection.
I then spent a further six days in hospital on an IV drip. The consultant never really identified the real cause of the infection. It was either very severe gastroenteritis or based on some of the blood antibodies that were found Hepatitis A. It was not a very pleasant experience.

"Hi guys, just want to share my experience of getting both my hips replaced at the same time, hopefully it will help someone)) 
I am 30 yers old, have RA that damaged my hip joints so badly that a few months before my surgery I literally couldn't walk for more than 10 min per day. Horribl pain, and after sitting down it would usually take about 5 min to get up and straighten my body. 
I had my bilatiral THR done on 21/09/2016. The result is amazing, I can walk without any pain! Wahoooo!!! 
It was a difficult desicion for me to get both my hips replaced at the same time as most surgeons don't want to take such risk. If something goes wrong with bilateral replacement the recovery can be a nighmare. However, for me it was important to get my life back as soon as possible and I didn't want to go through two seperate operations and two seperate stays in the hospital etc. Plus everytime you have an operation it is a risk of infection etc. Anywhere there are obviouosly pros and cons. So after stressing out for a while I made the decision to do both hips at the same time. 
The surgery went really well, done by Sarah Muirhead Allwood, she is a very experienced surgeon. She is not the soft kind that would wipe your tears and answer all your questions, sometimes she comes across a little bit rudish but she is damn good at what she does.
Before coming to her I went to see 3 different surgeons, talked to each of them about what type of prostetic hip they want to use, what type of surgery they would go for, type of fixation etc. It is important to do extensive research of everything involved in THR in the Internet, and know really well are the options you have and pros and cons of each option. Don't let surgeons make desicions for you. It is your hip after all. Doctors obviously know more than you might read in forums and some articles, but still ask questions and let them explain why they think something is the best option for you. I found the article about best THR surgeons in the UK in the daily mail [b]http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1303615/Britains-surgeons-hip-replacement-surgery--voted-specialists-themselves[b].html
I spoke to a few surgeons from that list and some of them offered really outdated options for me that I knew where not the best for my specific case. So when it comes to surgeons my tip is deffinately ""shop around"".

Anyway all this recovery was less painful than my condition before the surgery so I am glad I did it! I hope everyone a successful THR surgeries and speedy recoveries. Please do ask questions if you have any and I will try to response.

"Hello,
I wonder if any of you has a similar history as mine -
I had a failed hip scope March 2013.
First 3.5 months of recovery post-op were very good,
      then sudden Severe hip pain.
      For 6 months I was completely disabled.
2 sets of Xrays & MRI, multiple physical exams with multiple surgeons, have not revealed anything to explain the pain.
      Arthritis: only mild, very slow progression of joint space narrowing. 
       (Go figure! Everyone says it's amazing how good my joint space and remaining cartilage looks)
DO ANY OF YOU have (or used to have) a similar status - terrible disabling pain after failed hip scope, but no significant arthritis? 
    Question 1: Did you have a total hip replacement after failed hip scope despite ""mild"" arthritis?
    Question 2: Did you NOT have hip replacement surgery because surgeons don't recommend replacement because you don't have ""enough arthritis to indicate replacement"" ??
btw, I'm in Northern California, my health care is with Kaiser. If any of you want to recommend surgeons who have experience with BOTH hip scope patients AND hip replacement surgeons, I'd really appreciate it!!
For anyone who's interested in more details of my case:
Opinions from 2 hip replacement sugeons I was referred to who are very experienced and successful:
     1. Since I don't have moderate-severe arthritis, nothing else appears on Xray or MRI, and since 2 post-op steroid injections to hip joint did not relieve pain, they say hip replacement is not indicated.
      2. They only want to proceed with replacement if I develop moderate-severe arthritis.  (and that could be another 1-2 decades!)
Opinions from hip arthroscopy surgeons in the last 3 years:
      1. Since I'm older (now 58) and since no evidence of scar tissue, or cartilage/bone problems, they don't want to do another hip scope.
      2. They suggest pain management program (yes, I already did this program); stretching & conditioning for muscles & tendons (duh, I've been doing this all along).
      3. They emphasize that MRI often does not show ""the whole picture""; there could be something hidden that is causing pain. I asked if impingement could return (in my case it was a CAM impingment), or if CAM or Pincer could develop in same or different location after the hip scope.  2 hip scope surgeons say ""Yes"". My specific surgeon said ""No.""
    3 years of chronic severe pain, 2.5 years of some pain relief from low dose morphine tablets (15 mg) 1-2 times daily. 
Now Sept 2016, last 3 months pain has been increasing, and I had to increase morphine to 3 times daily.  In the last week 3 nights when I did not sleep for 1 minute. (Yes, even after 3 morphine doses, and ice packs numbing skin on my groin & hip)  Now I'm starting to freak out. I don't want to be completely disabled again, and I don't want to increase pain meds.
Click here to view image
Surgeon found 1cm frayed cartilage (Grade 4), which was removed. Some arthritis in the joint was ""cleaned up"". FAI confirmed, CAM impingement (Level 2), bone shaved down and reshaped. In surgeon notes he wrote he was surprised to find way more extensive cartilage damage and bone spur than was revealed on MRI.

"There are many, many posts regarding sleep (of the lack of it) post-op so I thought I would share (again), my favourite post from Kate, a fellow forum member. It is invaluable advice especially for the newbies.
SLEEP CLUB
Hi everyone, I was looking back through some old posts trying to find one about constipation if all subjects (!) & I found Kate's post about sleeping. I'm sure she won't mind as I've took the liberty of copying it again. It was such a great read & made perfect sense particularly now I'm post -op.
As I now consider myself a hip guru after two THR's wink I thought I would impart my most considerable knowledge about sleeping post op.
So as you gather in closer to the screen to read I am going to poke you in the eye and tell you the first first rule...
1) There are no rules of sleep club
In fact there are so many rules of sleep club world wide that it would be hard to confine them all but we are all victim to our country, our county and surgeons particular cruelty (I mean surgical style) when it come to how we are supposed to sleep. Anterior, posterior and lateral scars all bring their own particular delights when trying to stop doing the twist in the early hours.
So, you can arm yourself with the latest in latex support pillows, V pillows, small hand embroidered cushions that Aunty Edna gave you, mattress toppers, wedges, sleeping tablets, pain relief, whiskey cocktail or a complete hospital bed but one thing isn't going to change - your healing!
Our lives before were clock driven , getting a good night's sleep before getting up for work was imperative. Lack of sleep meant we couldn't function properly.
Now, the God of New and Shiny Hip Implants has thrown all that up in the air and we don't know where we are!
We toss and turn (very carefully) waiting for the elusive sleep that never comes or comes in annoying one hour servings. You think you have slept all night only to find that barely ten minutes has gone by since you last looked at the clock. You hobble out of bed with one eye shut, trying to fool yourself into staying asleep while you have a midnight wee and you just know that if you lie there a bit longer then YOU MUST fall asleep.
As we all know things at night are magnified to horror proportions and the sweating, the pain, the twitching, the discomfort have all become mountains we cannot climb.
So, you have read this far and you are waiting for me to give you the secret to sleeping all through the night after having part of your leg chopped off and in a position that you detest. Sorry, I don't have have those answers but what I have learned is....
This lack of sleep, is it so bad? Are you hoping to go to work in the morning? Are you leaping out of bed to go hiking, on holiday, ice sking? No.
The best cure I can find for lack of sleep is - chill out, go with it, let it happen.
Goodness knows what healing is going on inside but it doesn't confine itself to happening at night. It is imperative to rest in the first 6 weeks as it is to walk and that rest can be feet up on the sofa or a few catnaps throughout the day.
I have no problems with lack of sleep because I don't care about it.
A six weeks (today) after my 2nd THR I have learned that it is all transient. Regular sleep comes back in a position that we favour eventually and the trick is to stop worrying about it.
I sleep most of the night now, waking up between 5.30 and 6.30am. Once you find that it okay to find a sleeping place all over the house you will sleep much better as well.I was more comfortable on the sofa this time so that's where I went.
I watched all the films that no one else wanted to watch and knew that I was getting back to normal when it took me five nights to watch a film.
So, wave yourself a magic wand, stop fretting, this is temporary and I'll even go as far as to say enjoy it. For those going back to work that will come soon enough and your body regulates very quickly so in the meantime give yourself a night break, chill out - a bowl of ice cream at 3am is really rather nice!

"Welcome All,
My hip story started when I was 43 years old. I'm not going to go about pain and many other details here because we all have/had very similar situations. All enough then after long battle in Dec 2008 at the age 49 I received Cormet Hip Resurfacing (MoM Titanium) in my right hip (head size 2.40mm and femur 46mm).
Fast forward with my story... At that time nobody told me that I have to check my blood for a heavy metals in my system. I never received any re-calls none information's or not any warning regarding system poisoning. My previous surgeon never came forward with anything.   
In March 2016 at the age 57 I had my left hip done(full-ceramic on ceramic) so my current surgeon told me about massive MoM problems and ordered blood test plus MRI on my right hip. Actually from time to time hip was making some noises - squeaking but I never suspicious any series issues.
Blood results came back very bad. I was diagnosed with ""pseudo tumor"" and Metallosis (Cobalt was elevated to 964 and Chromium to 396).On July 07/2016 I had Revision surgery done. Currently I'm on recovery process from right full hip replacement (ceramic on ceramic).
Looks like for all this years since 2008 my system was poisoned...WOW maybe why since 2010 I experienced different health issues like""mysterious"" rushes on my body. Nobody can diagnosed what cost that problem. I had lots of tests done. I visited many specialists with no results(finally problem disappeared itself).
What I'm looking for is to contact people from Canada who have/had similar situation then mine to open Class Action against Corin Company or maybe Stryker who was distributor in Canada.
I posted this on Face book us well but I had no responds from anyone from CA.
It seems kind of wired that nobody in CA(accept myself), have/had Cormet by Corin implant? As a matter of fact there is very little information regarding Corin Company. I found very few articles about them on US website so seems like they are very well protected. There is Class Actions against other manufactures in CA but Corin.
I spoke to few lawyers regarding this so advise was to found more people to go forward with any action.
Do anyone here have some advise in this case?
Thank you for listening

"Hi All: I am missing all of you. Hope everyone is doing ok. I finished my blood thininning injections and my antibiotics. Not having to take those shots is a blessing and now I am able to take my Ibuprofin again. Am feeling pretty good this morning, so that is a good sign. I feel getting past all of that and the two week mark is a major milestone! I have great confidence that now I will start improving more and more. I have been doing my exercises like I am supposed to and right now they are starting to seem fairly easy for me. Which is wonderful. I look back at a couple of weeks ago and being in the hospital and the PT coming in and just trying to sit me up on the edge of the bed was a major deal. I couldn't even do it by myself and it took a long time just to get sit up. I compare that to now and just makes me want to say WOW what a difference! Looking forward to in the next couple of weeks to seeing another big difference. I know from experience not to expect too much very fast but am getting so excited about improving and getting back to my normal self. It is a great feeling and been a long time coming. Bless you all and know that you are all in my heart and I know what a hard time many of you have been through, but you still take the time to come on here and comfort others.

"Hi I'm a 38 year old father, married, father of three kids. when out cycling with my eldest daughter at the beginning of April, we both came off resulting in a broken left hip for me, but fortunately not a scratch on my daughter.
I had a vertical fracture on my left Femur, leaving the ball separated. The surgeon reattached it with 3 titanium bolts, with hope of the bone fusing back together. But as the fracture was vertical, he only gave it a 30% chance of success.
Even though the repair was completed only nine hours after the accident and me following the non use of the leg for six weeks, followed by six weeks of touch bearing only. The bone did not fuse. Touch bearing was very painful and I could feel the bone rubbing.
Four weekly XRays showed the bone had partially collapsed after the initial operation, but the type of bolts were keeping it all tight together. The down side was that my left keg was now nearly an inch shorter than it had been before, any use if my left keg showed a pronounced limp.
I had a CT scan at the end of July to check progress and the straight of the Femur was beginning to callous over and the ball was starting to collapse. There was evidence of fibrous tissue between the two main pieces of bone, but no bone regrowth.
I was in a lot of pain, with a cocktail of painkillers and other medication to counter side effects. My quality of life was much reduced and I was unable to do many things that I would do normally.
Maintenance of my house and garden has been completely left this year, so I haven't grown anything to pickle which is a family favourite. Neither have I been able to brew any beer, as I can't lift any of the barrels.
I am now two weeks post full hip replacement. With an uncemented ceramic hip. The op was done just two weeks after the decision was made. I had my private insurance involved, but they would only step in if the NHS couldnt do it within six weeks. My consultant also turned out to be one of their preferred surgeons.
My quality of life is already improved. Pain control is just paracetamol, I do get occasional pains the full length of my thigh, but that is after prolonged exercise. I am down to a single crutch for the majority of the time.
The hip replacement wasn't the original choice of my consultant due to my age. Sadly this has added to the problem. With four months of limited use, I have lost a lot of muscle mass in my left leg. The bone of my pelvis has reduced on my left side and will take time to get back to strength.
The biggest issue for me now is lack of sleep. Sleeping on my back leaves me with a painful back and the wound is still to uncomfortable to lay on for more than a few minutes.
To be honest, considering how much it has improved in the last two week I wish I had been able to have the replacement at the beginning.
I now want to get back to being active and able to get down and play with my son, who was two years old just two days before the accident.

"I had a full hip replacement in 2002 and thankfully have had no real problems at all. My question now is that how much longer have I got before it will need to be done again. Over the last few years I've been getting more and more pain but still not totally debilitating. The pain I have is varied. There's shooting pains in my thigh and a burning feeling on the inside of my thigh. When I get up there's a quite painful pop feeling. My knee and anckle have both been aching for a while now. I believe this is displaced pain because of my hip and that my leg is 2 1\2 cm shorter than my good leg. I'm just worried as I'm only 36 now so how much worse do things need to be before I need it doing again? What if the next 1 isn't as good as this 1? My GP has decided the pain I'm having is Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome but I'm not sure it is???.

I felt as if the surgery was successful , and the pain I was feeling was surgery recovery pain...until about the 8 th week when I began putting some weight on my leg.. and then the pain up my buttocks, the sensation of sitting on sharp rocks along with deep pelvic and groin pain and spasms came back full force. Only now I also have outer hip pain.
Cortisone shots didn't help.

After the hell I just went through - 12 weeks of painful PT so I could walk again, I cannot face surgery. Not now anyway.
Also my stepmother told me she had a THR and it was a piece of cake, she was up walking without crutches in just a few days and doing aerobics and kickboxing in a couple of weeks. So, I was shocked when I researched and read through the posts here... It certainly doesn't sound like the piece of cake she made it out to be.
Has anyone had a THR after hip repair? How long after? Can you compare the experience?
I'm only 58 years old, am in severe pain, but I've got a bit of PTSD about going under the knife again. My repair surgery was in October. It was supposed to be a simple anchor, but after going in, the surgeon discovered a mess, and he had to do quite a bit more than expected. It was exhausting for me.

My HR department have contacted me to see if I will return at six weeks or if I will go to GP to get more time off or a phased return to work.  My company are great (big US co.) so I am thinking to do a phased return.
Please can you share your return to office life experiences- how did you find the commute, sitting, concentration etc ?  I have a fairly demanding job so don't want to push myself back before my body is ready.
Thanks

"Hi All,
It is day three post op for me and things are going pretty well. I want to give a fairly detailed account of the last three days as reading this kind of thing really helped me prepare. Bearing in mind that everyones recovery will be different.
Day 0 - Operation Day
The hours following the op are a bit of a blur. I think I was in the theatre for several hours. When I came around I had very low blood pressure and this was consistent over the next 24 hours. Managed to stand and shift weight to my operated leg 6 hours after the operation. Had some nausea. Took a lot of pain killers through the night.
Day 1 - After Operation
Was spaced out for most of the day but thanks to ample pain killers was feeling pretty good. Managed to shower myself, only required assistance to put stockings back on. Managed to use crutches around the ward. By the afternoon I was cleared to go to the toilet on my own using crutches. This was probably my worse night pain wise.
Day 2 - After Operation
Crutched around the ward. Blood pressure returned to normal. Have full mobility with crutches. Passed the stairs test and getting in and out of car test. Pain eased off but still on pain killers periodically. First swelling started so began using ice packs. Able to do all lying and standing physio. Spent a few hours in a chair. Previous to the operation I could not sit for more than a few minutes without pain in the joint. Pain that would increase and become 10/10 until I got up and limped around. Now there is zero pain.
Day 3 - Today
Have woken this morning feeling fantastic. Went for a crutch around the ward. Swelling has reduced. My main problem is that I have been walking with a stiff hip for 20 or so years so having some difficulty getting the correct muscles to fire. This will come with time and effort. i am going home today.
There are some caveats on the above. I have been on around the clock pain killers which has hidden the pain and improved my general mood. And the worse may yet be to come. I have been advised that swelling and bruising are on the way.

"Hi, I am 48 years old and have osteoarthritis in my left hip that developed from hip dysplasia that I was born with.  I take 2400 mg of ibuprofen a day which keeps me pretty much pain free. Without that, I am in a pretty good amount of pain and can't walk more than 20  minutes without stopping.  I have been planning to get a THR, but am having second thoughts that maybe I should just take the ibuprofen for as long as it takes away my pain?  The surgeon said that my cartilage is gone and my hip is pretty much bone one bone, but I hate to go through the surgery at my age! Any advice?  Thank you!

"i started physical therPy a month ago after I found out that I have very severe oa in my left hip.  I was limping when I started an I had pretty bad  pain.  I was told to go to therapy because if I need THR I need to strengthen.  I seem to be so stiff and the mobility is so much worse. Maybe it's just my condition progressing  I just feel stiff everyday.  I had to get a cane for stability.  I just seem worse off.  Maybe you have to hurt before it improves.

"I had my THR exactly three weeks today and I've been recovering really well to the extent I'm already walking without sticks although I do use one to get up and down stairs.
I walk around my local neighbourhood for about 30 minutes each morning and afternoon without sticks. I don't have a limp and I can walk quite normally but I do have some discomfort in my replacement hip area. It's not so much a pain (like I had before the operation) but more like a soremess or ache which is no worse when I walk for the 30 minute period.
I'm assuming this is due to the soft tissue around the hip rather than anything wrong with the new hip itself--this forum is so good because we've all been through the same operation so I'm hoping some of you will have experienced the same and can assure me that what I'm experiencing is normal after three weeks.

Well, had my 6 week follow up, consultant was really pleased with my progress, but I mentioned that I have a pinching sensation in the middle of my buttock - on examination he told me it's because my sacroiliac has arthritis and has moved due to the new hip.

"I am 18 days post op and was doing well until yesterday when I got into the car and had a terrific pain in my joint. After a few deep breaths it settled down and I was able to get out at the other end, the pub! The same thing happened on the return journey. I have been in the car several times following the rules of getting in and out. Then last night in bed whilst asleep I had two big jerks which had me reeling in pain again. All is well this am but I am back to square one on the raising knee exercise whilst standing next to a bar, only about 30 % bend. I really hope I haven't blown this. Anyone else experienced this, advice and reassurance welcome.

"Those who have been here a while may know that my 2 big toe nails stopped growing and the nail beds became very sore after my hip op. This was due to the quilt weighing down on them (my big toes being considerably longer than the others). I eventually bought a bed cradle though too late to stop the damage. After a visit to the nurse I was told they would start growing again but it could take months. I had to wear canvas shoes as I couldn't stand any pressure on them.They did indeed finally start to grow about 6 months after the operation . A couple of months later I noticed something a bit odd. The bottom of the nail had come away from the nail bed and a new nail was growing underneath. The new nail is now just under half way up the length of the whole nail and now the old nail is about 3mm from the bottom. Looks like it will take at least another 8 months for the new one to get to the top - presumably the old one will just fall off. It's still a bit sensitive. I suppose it's the new one forcing its way up!
May be this is one of the weirdest side effects there is!
Any way any hippies who sense their toenails getting sore as they have to sleep on their back - get a cradle before it's too late!
Now I'm 9months post op I will be saying goodbye to the forum. Time to focus on getting on with life. There are plenty of new people to help the latest hippies as there were for me so this is my last post which may be of use to someone.
My hip is pretty good though the tissue around the scar and trocanter are still a bit too sore to lie on - no probs in the day though. I should be getting an xray in a couple of months so fingers crossed that will go well.
Good luck everyone with their ops and recovery.

"Hello lovely people, hope everyone is getting on well after surgery. 
I certainly am, as I'm back at work, back to my yoga class, booked a holiday and have very good movement in my hip at all angles. 
My problem is that after a heavy day at work on my feet- I work in a lab,so walk about a lot- I get terrible lower back pain. My PT says it will get better as the muscles strengthen, but I'm not feeling much improvement. I had a spinal block and wonder if that could contribute to pain. Because I am so tired after work I have slipped doing my post op exercises.I guess that could be the problem.
Anyway, if anyone has any experience or advice I will be very grateful. I'm not one to take painkillers if I can help it, but have had to resort to Nurofen a few times lately.
Thanks a lot, Ali xx

"I had my THR almost three weeks ago and physically I'm doing really well. I don't need sticks for walking although, of course,  I do use them for the stairs. 
The big problem I have is lack of sleep and after nearly three weeks it's beginning to really catch up on me. I find it very difficult to sleep on my back and if I'm lucky I might get 2/3 hours of sleep a night--as a result, I'm so tired during the day and actually dread going to bed at night!
When I left hospital the PT told me to sleep on my back for 6 weeks and if it was comfortable I could sleep on my operated side. Unfortunately, it's still too sore to sleep on that side so I'm now hoping to find a way to sleep on my ""good"" side.
Reading through the posts on this excellent forum it appears some of you have found ways to use a combination of pillows to make it safe to sleep on the good side but I'm very nervous to try because of the risk of discolation.
Does anyone have first hand experience of doing this successfully---or even the use of the purpose made slumber support mentioned in a couple of posts.

"Hello everybody! I am hoping to find some encouragement here. I am 30 years old and about 2 years ago I found out I have AVN in both hips. It came out of no where and as a surprise. I was very active always hiking, skiing, snowboarding and biking. Really hit me hard not being able to participate anymore and sit on the side lines cause it was so painful just to even walk anymore. Scared me and I am still scared.
May 26th I got a RTHR. So it's been a little over 2 months. I did my right first bc that was the one in most pain. The first couple weeks were difficult but after the home nurse came in and did some exercises I felt hope! I figured after a month I would have no problem walking without assistance and being able to get around with less pain. I opted out of pain medication reason being i am a recovering alcoholic. 11 months clean today!!! Anyways today I still walk with a cane and have lots of discomfort in my everyday routine. It's so discouraging.
When I found out I had AVN my liver and kidneys were shot so I went to treatment to get sober. So for a good year I was hobbling around just sucking up the pain trying to get clean while not helping my hips at all, the pain got so bad I left treatment and decided to get it done, you are probably wondering why I added that, but I just feel all that time I didn't fix it and get surgery I was limited and lost a lot of range of motion before do it's been A LONG time.
Sorry.
So here I sit doing PT 2 times a week 2 1/2 months out and I still limp, still in pain and still sit on the sidelines it's depressing... I a know party is because I need to do my left hip and I have to compensate for both in different ways so I m all messed up. I feel I should be walking and back to hiking now, am I the only one that's a couple months out and still in pain feeling like you've made no progress. I do get around the house with out a cane but if I leave the house it comes along. I feel like my friends look at my like aren't you better yet? I know it takes time and everyone's different and I need to get my other hip done but am I babying it or is it just slow for me? I m too young to be so down and out. Anyone with any kind uplifting stories and/encouragement would be greatly appreciated!! More than you all know! Again I am sorry about the ramble I have anxiety pretty bad and my minds all over the place. Love to all! God bless!!

"Friday night, my son fell in the bathtub. He is 30 yo, 7 weeks from RTHR. I warned him it was slippery. Of course he didn't tell me until later. His right foot slipped to the right, but he caught himself before he fell. He told me the hip felt uncomfortable, and the back of his thigh ached. I gave him naproxen and acetaminophen. We ended up calling the advice nurse. As I guessed, he was to watch for increasing pain and inability to put weight on that leg according to the surgeon. We bought a bath mat after finding out there aren't any where we are staying temporarily. On Monday, son decided he is okay but wants to know causes and what will help avoid dislocation. So I've been looking on this forum and the hip disorder one for information. Best to Linda81467 on her recovery from dislocation.
I will have to tell son he needs to do PT (none for the last 2 weeks) to strengthen glutes, swim or water exercises. No yoga, squats, turning or twisting.
I'm sorry I can't be here much, but hope you are all recovering. I can't say enough about how helpful this forum and its wonderful people continue to be. For those considering THR, especially because of AVN, recovery is difficult, but relief from the pain is worth it. JMHO as a mother.

"Hi guys,
I haven't been on here for a while, just been working away at getting better. However, getting a bit depressed as I'm 16 weeks in and fairly depressed. On the plus side I don't limp but I cannot sit for any length of time. Car journeys are a nightmare and I just lay down in the lounge instead of using a chair. My glute feels like it is on fire and that makes my groin really sore. Is this normal? I'm still struggling to reach my foot in the shower or put a sock on. One particular thing I wouldn't mind some thoughts on is that I have a swollen area just in from the scar - it is numb to touch but hurts like hell if I press it or sleep on that side. When I saw the surgeon at 7 weeks he said it was 'where he made a hole to go in'. Will this go away and how do I sort it? I'm doing physio, bike rides and swimming. Can manage about 3 to 5 miles on my road bike and about 20 lengths of crawl - is that too much at 4 months? Problem is i'm due to have my other hip done in Oct and I feel very apprehensive. Any thoughts greatly appreciated.

"Hey everyone,
Oooh I'm so frustrated....still on my stick!!!
I feel as though I'm doing ok, although extremely slowly!! After my last post, I have started physio sessions (I'm in the UK and really had to fight for these). I'm just unsure if this is actually helping at all?? I'm just wondering what everyone else's view is on this? There seems to be two views..one that physio is definitely needed and another where simply walking is enough to aid recovery. The problem is when I walk my hip feels weak, like it is not ready to support my weight. I have looked in a mirror as I walk and my knee doesn't straighten enough when I push through with my operated side.
I have also started using the exercise bike just for 10 mins a day.
This is my 9th week and while I find myself improving in very small ways, the one thing I really want to improve is walking without a limp. Unfortunately, I walked with a limp for years before I had my op. I feel like a toddler learning to walk all over again. I'm supposed to be returning to work on the 5th Sept, but I'm sure not I'm going to make it at this rate.
Any advice on any of the above would be so grateful.
Hope everyone is doing ok ??

"Hi Hippies
Can anyone suggest a suitable device to attach to our walking sticks, so we can clip them to the back of chairs or tables or work tops. 
Other than tying a yellow ribbon on it and hooking it over my wrist I would welcome other suggestions. Some clips on eBay have rather negative comments.
Thanks everyone

"I had my THR exactly 2 weeks ago today and I'm recovering incredibly well. I'm walking without sticks indoors but use one stick when I venture outside on my daily walks. Like many others I'm having problems sleeping on my back although, as time goes on that is getting better.
For some reason with a hip replacement I have to take a blood thinning tablet every day for 5 weeks--I've been given rivaroxaban 10mg (Xarelto).
Although the information inside the medicine box makes no mention of alcohol I have read on a few websites that you shouldn't drink any alcohol while on Xarelto. Has anyone else been prescribed this blood thinning tablet and, if so, what have they done about an occasional glass of wine?

"Hi fellow Hippies!
Well I had my 2nd replacement done today and so far so good. I feel great, no nausea. They took my issues last time into account and changed their formula a bit. Still a spinal though. Pain is minimal but that could reflect the effects of good drugs! Even got up on the commode instead of the dreaded bed pan! Anyway here's hoping tomorrow goes as well.
Hope all of you are doing well!

"Hello friends, thanks for being such a great help and for your valuable suggestions. Today again I seek your valuable inputs. Before that I just wanted to let you know brief of my surgery.
I'm 35 year old, had LTHR on date Jul 15, 2016. Initial days were very depressing sometimes felt like that why I have done this, but today no complaints. I think I recovered exceptionally well. I walk without any aid about 4 Km every alternate day with a limp, no leg discrepancies yet except operated leg is thinner as it was before too. After walk I feel pain in non operated leg which is sometimes unbearable. Then I had to take hydro morphine so that I can sleep. My operated leg was dead weight when started physiotherapy and was not able to pick it up but now I put 1kg weight on it do 3 sets of 10 reps (hold for 5 secs every rep). I still have to go to my surgeon for follow up. I'm still following 3 months precautions but not strictly because sometimes I feel very ok as my body allows it but do things only up-to certain limits. I do not drive yet.
My leg looks good but sometimes I afraid of dislocating it. I just wanted to know is it possible that joint could be dislocated even if there no pain, no discrepancies no problem in doing exercise/ walking etc.
Please advise.
You may please ask me anything specially if need.
Thanks friends
All the best

"Hi all. Hope all you hippies are doing well today. I'm just past 12 weeks post THR on my left side. Everything's been progressing well. One of my PT exercises is to stand sideways on a step or box and lower the heel of the other foot towards the lower step or floor. I've been doing this probably since week 2. Well yesterday I started to do them and when I placed my hand on my thigh next to the joint, I could feel a kind of bumpy rotation of the joint. It was a little scary. I hadn't noticed this before but I'm not sure I ever placed my had on the joint.
Anybody else have something like this? Have you talked to your surgeon about it. Thanks in advance.

"Hi
I'm waiting for my total hip replacement  ! I was avoiding it for five years!! . Until I just couldn't take the  pain anymore . I neglected myself and I did not do much physical therapy after my surgeries in the past . I have stiffness in my knee + muscle weakness in general . 
I started to do physiotherapy two weeks ago . It's still stiff but I had some progress .The bending now is around 100 degree . I have strong pain in it because of my weak muscles . 
I struggled in the past with infection in the hip . How long it's going to take me to recover ? I have shortening in the leg around 2.5 cm .
the doctor said he will try to pull it during the surgery ! Also he says he will try to bend the knee more . I just I didn't get that part lol ! Is that possible !? 
When I can go back to gym after surgery  ?

"PT took out my staples today and put on steri stripes, glad I got those staples out.  They have me doing standing excersises at the sink for balancing to get me redy to transition to a cane next week.  I am 11 days post op.  I haven't said anything as I know most people have a tough time of sleeping on their backs, can you believe the day of my surgery the nurse asked"" would you like to sleep on your side?"" I looked at her like she had gone mad.  I was told as long as I had a pillow between my legs I could sleep on non surgical side.  The therapist asked me today f I wanted to stay on my side and take a nap when she was done with staple removal. I will stick to my back.
I guess I am making progress I o know sometimes I sure put a lot of weight on the walker. Can't imagine using a cane.

Also, I was given permission to stop wearing that awful stocking and using the shower in my bath. Bliss! I am still on one crutch but starting to walk without it in my home. He said not to rush the unaided walking.  Alas,I am not allowed to drive until 6 weeks post-op but I can handle that. Hope everyone is well

"I know im not active as much recently, iv just been in my own bubble i suppose. So for those who dont know me il do a quick recap. Im 20 years old, had my complex thr on the 11th of April so about 16 weeks post op, i had collarbone surgery 6 weeks ago which seems to be healing well. Iv had 14 surgeries in total at the moment, 13 for hip and then the collar bone.
So recently im beginning to wonder if iv made the wrong decission, before surgery i was in serious chronic pain, had no life, no mobility, unable to work and so on. And now im exactly the same but the pain is even worse. My new hip is still hurting, still no mobility, my right hip seems to be getting worse and my back pain is even worse than usual, lately when im walking certain areas of my back feel like they are being twisted and then it starts grinding and popping and cracking, my knees are doing the same, then i have the usual knee and back pain from norma activities like washing the dishes, sitting, standing, cleaning the lizards out and so on.
so im general i just feel horrendous, i feel like im getting know where. Before the surgery i made the huge mistake of getting my hopes up thinking things may be a tiny bit bet, i knew id still have the issues with my back and knees but now i feel like everything has just gotten worse. I dont want sympathy, i just want to know if anyone feels the same or is experiancing anything similar. 
It doesnt help that im intimidated by my surgeon and i feel as if he doesnt take me seriously or listen to my problem.

"Hi fellow hippies old and new!
Some of you may remember me from what seems like a million years ago -such a long journey.
I am 64 years old, very active and work full time
I had my RTHR  with Michael Cronin at Coventry Hospital using Superpath method of surgery on 10th June 2015, following a very long wait and much pain and limping and lurching around.
I recovered quickly and have had an excellent result - the operation gave me my life back.
Went for my annual check with Michael Cronin last week. He said that hip was even better than when he operated on me. No movement in joint at all and because I had non cemented implant, bone had grown round it and was very strong and secure. Movement in the joint is excellent. Sometimes I cannot believe I had this operation as my hip feels perfectly normal and it just seems to get better and better. In fact I have noticed a real improvement over the last 3 months
Michael Cronin is now training other surgeons to do this pioneering Superpath surgery so hopefully more people will benefit from it.
So to all of you out there in the worried and nervous pre op phase and going through the painful early days/sleepless nights post op, it does get so much better and I am so glad I had my op. There was never any doubt in my mind - I had to have the op if I was to ever lead a normal life again!
I feel reborn and can do almost everything I could do before.
Still need to have a bit of physio on muscles in unoperated hip/ leg from all the bad walking practices pre op but I am so grateful to my wonderful surgeon for his skill and expertise in getting me sorted out.
Have faith that you will get well, religiously do your exercises. Yes, you will have rough days in the early stages and wonder how you will ever get back to how you used to be. Be patient, be positive, never ever lose heart. Your attitude is all important in you getting well
I wish all of you the very best for the future. Use this wonderful forum - it got me through many sleepless nights in the early days. Some very kind and supportive folk on here
Kindest regards Linda

"Or a light hearted look at post op issues:
1.       You will pee for England (or insert your country here) for at least a week.  Be prepared cos you just won稚 be able to control yourself.  If you don稚 have a loo near your bedroom, invest in a bucket and pretend you池e glamping.
2.       You will only have the attention span of a gnat.  If you had planned on catching up on reading and/or all those box sets, forget it.  As soon as you start concentrating on that book or the first episode of the box set, you will be asleep.
3.       Be prepared to fall asleep at any point during the day.  At night you won稚 be able to get to sleep at all.
4.       Get used to the fact that you値l have to (not) sleep on your back.  I know very few people who actually sleep on their back by choice.  It is a really uncomfortable position and will result in getting backache after a few hours.
5.       Make sure you have short toenails, especially on the big toes as the pressure from any bedclothes will hurt toes and your heels.
6.       Compression socks  so sexy and comfortable  not.  They are an essential fashion accessory for 6 weeks for all hippies.  Surely they must be classified as a form of torture!
7.       Your operated leg will feel like it weighs a ton for the first week.  It also feels like it doesn稚 belong to you. It will get better.
8.       Don稚 tell your spouse/family/friends about your op in detail.  They really aren稚 that interested and it would be nice if family/friends visited more than once.  Best to just post on to this forum.
9.       Don稚 believe the adverts  pre-prepared meals are terrible.  The actual contents have only a passing semblance to the packet photo. The ingredients used are usually the cheapest the manufacture can get away with.  To add insult to injury the portion size is for a child.
10.   Any chocolates/sweets/puddings eaten during your recovery period are deemed to be non-fattening  and don稚 listen to anyone who tells you otherwise.

"My 90 years old grandmother lives in China. She broke her hip about than 2 month ago. After she initially fell my uncles who lives in China (but not with her) thought she simply sprained her leg, so she was just bedridden for an entire month. My sister who lives the states went to visit her a month ago and discovered that she still bedridden and was in a lot of pain and decided to take her to the hospital for a checkup. It was discovered that she broke her hip (Intracapsular Fracture, the ball of the femur is broken). So due to negligence from my uncles she was left untreated for over a month. For the past month my sister and I have been trying to convince our grandmother to do a partial hip replacement.
She just did a physical and her organs are all in good shape and healthy, and deemed quite fit for hip replacement surgery. However, she is extremely afraid of the surgery and was reluctant to participate. In addition, one of the uncles refuse to let her do surgery because he believes that she値l heal somehow and be able to sit again, and that the after effects of the surgery is not something he wants to deal with (if things go wrong). However I managed to convince her to do the surgery if I go back (I live in Canada) to see her through the surgery and early stages of recovery.
My grandmother has osteoporosis a bad knee and this newly broken hip. Before she broke her hip she could walk with assistance by using a walker or holding the wall, but not for long. For example she could go to the bathroom by herself or went to the shelf to get something. For majority of the day she alternates between sitting and laying down (probably about 50/50). Today she is mostly bedridden, she probably cannot sit for more than 1 hour before pain becomes unbearable. So she only sits up for her meals.
My thinking is that even if she somehow manages to sit up, it痴 still gonna take her another few month bed ridden until she can sit upright, whereas after surgery she can sit up in days. I don稚 have much hope for her to walk again but I figured sitting sooner has to be better for her health because I致e confirmed with multiple doctors that bedridden increases your chances of having organ failure significantly. So if she does the surgery and successful recovery, her chances of living another few more years increases significantly.
Based on what I described do you think she should get the replacement? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"15 weeks post replacement and i am back at work. People are noticing that i am often still limping. i have no pain at all in my new hip and have no awareness that i am liimping. Could this be due to the muscle being weak still? or perhaps ive had a bad limp and waddle for so long before my surgery that i dont know how to walk properly? i dont want to end up with a permanent limp. At the moment i am relying on my colleagues to tell me if i am limping so then i try and correct the limp - even tho i have no awareness of this
Has anyone else had this prob

"Hey mates
I have just sat and read loads about knee replacement from there forum and boy do l feel a nillion times scared than l did before it.
Before anyone says l am an old tmer from the hip forum aschsd both hips replaced and thid just feels like home to me.
I woke up at 3am oviously worried aboutnthis op and leaving my mum ( she has found out she has cancer in lung and civerung broncial branch and main artarey to heart) so there is no chance of surgery for her to remove either the tumour or the lung. I have been there every srep of the way up to now. So l am worried sick about leaving her but it has to be done as my knee is getting worse by the day. I also have a recovering husband who has been out of hospital for just over a week after having some virus that attacked his brain so for 2 weeks there l was a waljing train wreck. Panic attacks constantly. Thank gog he got better and is now home recovering but l have been looking after him since he came out as he got a massive fright and also seeing my mum daily as because l have been to every appointment and took her everywhere while they were investigating and trying to be her rock of posativity she has attached herself to me. My sister is usless and my brother is in america. She has ny dad who is also stessed to the max trying to cope with her so l have been trying to take some of the pressure from him. But after tuesday thats ne housbound for 4 weeks so l am worrried about leaving her and my husband who is still not 100% yet but he will be ok.
My worst thing l could have done was look at the knee forum ascit just seems to be pain pain pain and problems. Onecperson said he was in intensive care fot 4 days after. The rest are just saying how bad it it and how they are getting knowhere l am scared stiff l am even thinking should l cancel and just suffer the oain and walk with an awful limp. Honestly folks l am getting tested just now as this has been an awful time for me and l alway felt better on this forum. Right now l have my mum crying everyday sayingvshe wishes l was not foing in. Its so hard but l need a break myself and to look after my own health and l feel selfish saying that.

"Just at 3 month post RTHR and my cat was returned home to me after being watched by a friend. Normally my cat rarely if ever scratches me but after an hour of her being back home she decided to get fresh and when I petted her, she decided to swipe my right hand near my palm. It's not at all like her but fair to her she was away from me and the transition was difficult for her being away from me for 3 months.
What worries me is that 5 years ago when I took her in, she tested positive for cat scratch fever. I treated her at that time with antibiotics but never retested her to see if that still harbors in her system. That was 5 years ago.
Now I'm concerned how this can effect my hip joint and do I need to be on an antibiotic just in case. She did break the skin. I pored alcohol on it till it burned, used hydrogen peroxide and then Neosporin. It's just a small scratch but I'm still worried. Happened late Friday night and I can't call my surgeon until Monday. Should I worry?

"I have had problems with my hip joint that have steadily worsed over the last 10 years and rapidly worsened over the last 2 or so years. 
I had reached the point of needing strong pain killers to sleep and using crutches when having to go to the shops. I was in excrutiating pain often and could walk more than a couple of hundred metres.
My surgery for LTHR is in two weeks.
Over the last 2 months I have been going to physio and diligently working on leg, glut and core strengthening exercises. I have also been maintaining a healthy diet and have lost 5 kilograms.
Yesterday I spent the entire day walking with only mild discomfort and wasn't limping until about the 7000 step mark. I slept through the night without pain killers. 
I am beggining to think that maybe I don't need this op yet but everything is booked in and paid for and there is the weight of expectation from friends, family and work.

"This is a question that I thought might be useful for up-and-coming hippies.
For clarification, these possible benefits and amounts are only relevant if you live in England  Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland may differ.
My understanding is this  if you池e employed then you will be signed off for a number of weeks (which will depend on your own personal recovery rate) and for those weeks you will be paid occupational sick pay (as per your employment contract) if you池e lucky, or statutory sick pay of ｣88.45 p/w (for 2016/17) if you池e not quite so fortunate. If you池e self-employed, it痴 just tough luck and you get nothing, though you could be eligible for ESA.
ESA (Employment and Support Allowance) is another benefit which is available to both employed and self- employed and is worth ｣73.20 p/w for over 25s.  If eligible if will also entitle you to help with your Council Tax.  Please note that this benefit is based on both you and your spouse/partner痴 income.
The ESA does seem to involve jumping through quite a few hoops and should probably be instigated before surgery.

"Hi my lovely hipsters
I'm back at work now - went back to work at week 12. Had the choice of going back phased return but decided to get on with it and work the normal 12 hour shifts. It's 14 weeks post lthr now and all good. I still cannot put my socks on properly and i still get very stiff if I sit for too long but no pain at all which is good. I'm a nurse in a busy ae dept so on my feet a lot. One thing my colleagues have noticed is that towards the end of the shift I do start limping - I'm wondering if this is just still due to muscle weakness as I don't realise I'm limping. Also in my right foot I have now developed plantar fasciitis which is damn painful - and again wondering if it's because I'm still favouring my good leg or because I have a slight leg discrepancy. It's only 0.5cm shorter so I have put a heel raiser in my left shoe (0.5) to see if that helps. I'm hoping all things settle down as my right hip has oa too and will need doing in around 2 years and don't want it getting worse sooner.
Hope all you hipsters are getting on well. I guess these small little problems are just still part of the recovery

"Well today I went to see my surgeon. I'm 3 weeks out. He had X-rays done and found out I dislocated my hip!!?? After speaking to him I think we figured out when & how... About 2 weeks ago I was taking a shirt out of my drawer. I was not facing the drawer so I was twisted toward my left side, I had thr on the right. When I proceeded to close the drawer I noticed a kind of sharp pain in my right buttock. I thought ""oh sh*t what was that?!?"" I had pain on that buttock for several days and when I talked to my therapist she felt I pulled a muscle since the pain went away. Only thing is as time went on I have been unable to put weight on that leg. Last Thursday and Friday I was in a lot of pain. But for the most part I have been putting some pressure on that leg, stand on both legs and do my exercises. Dr was amazed!! So hippies it's VERY IMPORTANT TO TWIST LEFT OR RIGHT!! Always stay straight in whatever you are doing!! Has this happened to anyone else?? I will be going back in the OR Thursday to see if he can pop back in without having to cut me again. Under local anesthesia. Y me??? ??

"This was my 6 week review at 8 weeks and the news is good.  I am now walking without a stick and no limp! I have very little pain - more of a muscle ache, especially when I over do it - and no need for any pain medication. The restrictions have been lifted - so goodbye to that lovely (but useful) item in the bathroom, the raised toilet seat. I also received a warning about still being careful bending at the hip for the next 6 weeks. No real worries with that, my hip soon lets me know if I'm doing something it doesn't like!
The bad news is that my other hip (which hadn't been hurting despite also showing severe OA on the x-ray), is now beginning to hurt.  The surgeon is going to keep an eye on it with regular follow up appointments (the next one in December) but suspects I will have to have it replaced at some point next year.  He did add that he would be only too pleased to be proven wrong (me too).

"There are many, many posts regarding sleep (of the lack of it) post-op so I thought I would share (again), my favourite post from Kate, a fellow forum member. It is invaluable advice especially for the newbies.
SLEEP CLUB
Hi everyone, I was looking back through some old posts trying to find one about constipation if all subjects (!) & I found Kate's post about sleeping. I'm sure she won't mind as I've took the liberty of copying it again. It was such a great read & made perfect sense particularly now I'm post -op.
As I now consider myself a hip guru after two THR's wink I thought I would impart my most considerable knowledge about sleeping post op.
So as you gather in closer to the screen to read I am going to poke you in the eye and tell you the first first rule...
1) There are no rules of sleep club
In fact there are so many rules of sleep club world wide that it would be hard to confine them all but we are all victim to our country, our county and surgeons particular cruelty (I mean surgical style) when it come to how we are supposed to sleep. Anterior, posterior and lateral scars all bring their own particular delights when trying to stop doing the twist in the early hours.
So, you can arm yourself with the latest in latex support pillows, V pillows, small hand embroidered cushions that Aunty Edna gave you, mattress toppers, wedges, sleeping tablets, pain relief, whiskey cocktail or a complete hospital bed but one thing isn't going to change - your healing!
Our lives before were clock driven , getting a good night's sleep before getting up for work was imperative. Lack of sleep meant we couldn't function properly.
Now, the God of New and Shiny Hip Implants has thrown all that up in the air and we don't know where we are!
We toss and turn (very carefully) waiting for the elusive sleep that never comes or comes in annoying one hour servings. You think you have slept all night only to find that barely ten minutes has gone by since you last looked at the clock. You hobble out of bed with one eye shut, trying to fool yourself into staying asleep while you have a midnight wee and you just know that if you lie there a bit longer then YOU MUST fall asleep.
As we all know things at night are magnified to horror proportions and the sweating, the pain, the twitching, the discomfort have all become mountains we cannot climb.
So, you have read this far and you are waiting for me to give you the secret to sleeping all through the night after having part of your leg chopped off and in a position that you detest. Sorry, I don't have have those answers but what I have learned is....
This lack of sleep, is it so bad? Are you hoping to go to work in the morning? Are you leaping out of bed to go hiking, on holiday, ice sking? No.
The best cure I can find for lack of sleep is - chill out, go with it, let it happen.
Goodness knows what healing is going on inside but it doesn't confine itself to happening at night. It is imperative to rest in the first 6 weeks as it is to walk and that rest can be feet up on the sofa or a few catnaps throughout the day.
I have no problems with lack of sleep because I don't care about it.
A six weeks (today) after my 2nd THR I have learned that it is all transient. Regular sleep comes back in a position that we favour eventually and the trick is to stop worrying about it.
I sleep most of the night now, waking up between 5.30 and 6.30am. Once you find that it okay to find a sleeping place all over the house you will sleep much better as well.I was more comfortable on the sofa this time so that's where I went.
I watched all the films that no one else wanted to watch and knew that I was getting back to normal when it took me five nights to watch a film.
So, wave yourself a magic wand, stop fretting, this is temporary and I'll even go as far as to say enjoy it. For those going back to work that will come soon enough and your body regulates very quickly so in the meantime give yourself a night break, chill out - a bowl of ice cream at 3am is really rather nice!

"I'm a 44 year old female who has just undergone a total left hip replacement , ceramic on ceramic , 6 weeks ago , I had a slipped upper femoral epiphysis at the age of 11 and had my hip pinned back in place , this left me with severe rotation deformity and I have never been able to ride a bike or squat correctly , my leg would not rotate inwards and my leg was 2cm shorter than the right , due to severe arthritis and severe pain I had the THR, I'm worried as to how long my new hip will last and if there is anyone on here who has had the same , I'm hoping my alignment will straighten up eventually and I will have straight / correct form, both my legs are now the same length , prior to surgery I was joggingand weight training , I won't be jogging again but my surgeon says I can resume weight training as soon as I'm completely healed up , I'm still walking with 2 crutches after 6 weeks as my hip still feels
Tender , I'm wondering how long it will be before my alignment becomes straight as it has been
Twisted for over 35 years , my surgeon says I now have 100 rotation with the new joint , if anyone has a similar story I'd love to hear from you ,

"Hey everybody!!  Hope it's a good day.  I am three months post THR and still having alot of pain.  I initially had foot drop after surgery and had major nerve pain, especialy in my foot.  Still have the needles sensation in foot and lower calf.  I had a really bad charlie horse in my r calf a week or so after surgery and the whole calf is very  sore to touch, feels like I'm touching a bruise.  Has anyone else had this and if so is it permanent?  Still doing stretches and home pt.  Thanks for any help(honestly the way the surgeon and pt people treat me it's like it's my fault for the foot drop)

"I have noticed on this forum that we all casually throw these terms about and yet after looking at some websites, I'm not too sure that I actually know what they actually mean.
For example, I had the posterior approach which I thought would mean that I would have a scar on my bottom (on the bit that you sit on to be precise).  Well I don't, the scar is still on the side of my leg, curving at the top towards my bottom. 
So what does the term posterior approach actually mean.  Posterior to what? I think I have now worked it out, but would be most interested in other peoples understandings of the terms.

"Hi all
Some of you newbies might not know me l hope some of the long timers do.
I had my 2 hips replaced 1st in dec last year 2nd in feb due to OA. This forum was my lifeline when l went through both it helped me so much and l met loads of great people. I have been missing for a while as my life has basically been hell. Not because of my hips as it the best thing that l had done as it took away so much pain l had went through for a year previous not knowing l had OA but thinking l had a pulled mucsle then after no inprovment my gp and l thought it might be actorn tendon but l went on suffering taking painkillers just so l could get up and go to work.
It all became to much when it reached november last year when l was lying on the ground in tears trying to put my jeans on. My husband seen me and said enough is enough. So l went back to gp this time l was sent for xrays and a week later l was sitting getting told l needed both hips replaced as they were beyond repair bone to bone on both sides. I was in shock at 42 years old it was the last thing though l would be told. However l am lucky enough to have private medical care as a benifit from my work and within no time l had my 1st appointment to get left replaced on december 15th. So l had it done and my recovery was textbook l was very lucky thats when l foundcthis forum and realised 42 was not young at all to be having it done there was a lot more young people who had been through it and were about to go through it that had a much tougher life than me and had suffered most of there young life. So l am not going to complain. By week 4 after my 1st lthr l was desperate to get other one done. I felt ready l wasxdriving again a could walk without aids but don't get me wrong l suffeted the pain at the begining just like everyone else and all the lovely stuff that comes along with thr's. Lack of a normal sleeping pattern days of feeling really down andchust crying. I experianced them all yet this forum helped me through it as we were all going through it together.
2nd hip replacement done 8 weeks later in feb as my doctor warned me it might be a totally diffrent experiance from the 1st and it was. I cannot explain the diffrence it just was. I was able to move it right away , not like my 1st where l woke up and felt like my leg was a dead weight and the pain was awful for the 1st week. It was much easier still sore but l was ok. I was only in hospital 4 days this time instead of 5.
So recovery has been hard l have been off my work since november. I was stuck at home and tbh thats where a wanted to be. The only contact l had was this forum it keotbme sain. There wre days l just cried and other dayscl was ok butvl madecgood frriends. As times went by l have got back to a more normal life but whenl was walking aa part of my recovery l noticed my knees were getting really sore and swollen stiff. Back to the gp where ll was sent for more xrays in my hips and knees.
Great news again......i need both knees replaced now. So since then my life has been hell. Asxsome of you oldies might remember my mum got cancer in her lung even though she has never smoked and lives really healthy..
My life for the last month or so is been hectic l have been with my mum through every test scan and appointment. Final outcome she has a mass in her left lung that is covering her broncial branch and main artery to heart so they can't operate or remove lung as she would justcdie because of where cancer is so shevis getting a treatment plan done just now to give her chemo and radio or a combinationn of both depending on how she reacts to that. So l jave soent day after day trying to keep her posative and say she had hope and she just needed to fight it all the way. Then 2 weeks ago my husband got sick we thought it was just a flu or something he had a high temp and was really sick. Long story as shortvas l can he ended up in hospiral as he had a virus that attacked his brain and lost control of what was real and was confusedvlike he had severe brain damage. They treated him with the strongest antibiotics you can get for like meningitis and other brain viruses. I really thought l had lost him. So my time fir past 3 weeks has been hospital home hospital mums hospital hospital hospital. I don't knowcto this day how l coped. But thankfully l have my husband bacj he is home and recoveing. My mum is still needing me more than ever. And to top it all l have my 1st knee replacement next tuesday. I was going ti cancel it but l aam not delaying it as l srill have other ine to get done after and its time for my big brither ans sister to take some of the stress off me and step in and help althiugh my mum just wants me and my husband as we have been there from day one. The quicker l get my op the quicker l can get back to normal.
I have no idea what the future holds if l wiill still have a job after being iff for so long but its all about prioritys just now my health my mums my husbands. I am scared stiff about the knee op as l have heard its a lot more pain. But hey l can do it.
Sorry for the very long post l just wanted to tell you all l will be back and whats been happening. I know its knee replacements l am going through now but the hip.forum is my home.
Hopefully things can only get better now.
Hello to you all that l have missed talking to. Renee Linda and thete is loads more. I have sarah and cels andcsoos that know that l dont ne馘cto updatecas they all know.
I wish l could take my sarah with me but she is always there for me and my other. All of you ??.

Wish me luck in the knee rep time..

Painful, yes. But I'm controlling the pain with meds. Every 4-6 hours and I take two every 5. Today was my last day of at home pt. Monday I start out patient. My range of motion is 78, when I got home from the hospital it was 60. No driving yet....only because I can't bend my knee enough.

"My initial appointment with a consultant was scheduled for mid January at a private clinic, which was one of my first two choices.  Last week, it was cancelled and I made another appointment with a different consultant at an NHS hospital.  The consultant I shall be seeing came highly recommended, so I am happy about that.  However, I do not wish the surgery to take place at the NHS hospital.  I would prefer either of the the two first choice clinics, both of which are private and have been recommended by other hip patients.
My question is, although the consultation is at an NHS hospital, the consultant also operates at the two cinics; can I specify the clinic where I wish to have the surgery, or having initially seen the consultant at an NHS hospital, do I have to have the surgery there?  The other issue is that having spoken to one of the clinics, I have been advised that they adhere to the 18 week rule and the NHS hospital does not.

All your contributions have been extremely helpful and all this knowledge I gained helped me to go in to hospital relaxed and full of confidence. All went well and I was able to go home early thanks to the recommended gym preparation on this forum. It is really paying off in a major way. Did not sleep very well last night but am not too worried about that. I am sure it will all fall back into place again. No major pain, doing my exercises and already managed to walk on one crutch around the house. Thanks once again for sharing all your experiences and giving such useful advice. Kind regards, Ruth

Told I should start walking with no supports and just use cane for steps (super modern house with 17 shines wood steps to the second floor.)
So sleeping on my back is my nemesis and I just can't get comfortable so sleep is difficult. Going to look for a good side pillow to put between my legs because my inventions aren't working well.

I think I'm doing ok but I really didn't understand how major this is.  I feel semi human when up and walking but sitting and lifing my leg to elevate it or get into bed is disillusioning.  Just started PT exercise of sitting on the edge of the bed and trying to lift my leg......it's so weak.  Think I need some encouragement other than my husband who is very supportive and thinks every step I take is great.

"Son had his first THR in March and was NEVER issued these. They would have just annoyed him. I understand the feeling, as my own GP suggested them. We all know they are not the easiest things to put on.
He is at week four after his second THR, and the nurses in recovery threw a pair in with his things and said, ""We don't know if your doctor wants you to wear these."" I didn't say a word about them. They are somewhere in a corner of the apartment, and will probably be left in the garbage room for whoever wants them, the two spirometers he never used, and the toilet riser we both came to hate!
Taking aspirin is a good alternative to the socks. My condolences to all who are required to wear them.

"Yes, it's true the ortho had an opening for surgery one week after we went for the 4-month postop on the LTHR.
Let's back up a bit, though. At the previous appointment, son had an MRI to see if there was AVN in the non-operated hip. He was crushed to find out that was the case. We had already discussed the alternative to THR - core decompression. I had researched this and learned it only worked for a very few people, only for a few years, and they ultimately had to have THR. CD is more painful post-surgery, also takes longer to recover from, and you need to wait a year to know if it was successful. Knowing all of this, it was NOT an option.
However, son started the discussion with the orho about the success rate. Surgeon admittled it was 40% effective AT BEST. We asked, well what about those patients who you've done this procedure on? 
The ortho said he operated on a 12 y/o boy who ended up having a THR done by another surgeon. (He looked defeated as he said this.) Son then asked what it would take for him to have the RTHR. ""Time"" doctor said, then realized how ridiculous that was for ANYONE. Including a 12 y/o boy. He really convinced himself!
At that point dr said he had an opening next week. In reality it took another week, because they were short-staffed that week. In the meantime I got the runaround from my own insurance company, when in fact no prior approval was necessary because it was same day surgery - no hospital stay involved because son qualified for the program where you leave the hospital after recovering sufficiently from anesthesia. Then you make your own way across the highway to the Hilton, where you stay for 2 nights. A nurse is down the hall and comes in to give you your meds, take your vitals, etc. A PT person comes the next day, as does the doctor's assistant. Son could have showered the next day, and the nurse helps if you need it. 
No oxycodone, so no waterfall sweats, crazy itching, dizziness. Spinal, so no 4-month fog. 
So, be sure to refuse any drugs you've had a bad interaction with - these just delay your getting well. And please do your research before taking the word of a doctor. Remember they are only speaking in generalities. And it's likely none of them have had any of these procedures. 
We had 6 questions for the surgeon:
1) LLD - yes, right several mm shorter than left - x-ray shows this. I think surgeon was a little regretful at this.
2) When can son get dental surgery he needs (this is a whole other story that probably includes a dentist's incompetence. I haven't sued anyone yet, but that may change) At first ortho said 3 months, but because it involves son's general health - ANY TIME.
3) In your experience, does AVN affect other joints? Only in the case where the patient has had a transplant. They take anti-rejection drugs which have side effects.
4) Please check my hematoma. Greatly reduced - not a problem now.
5) I am relocating, do you know any ortho in my new area? Sorry, no. I would check you in a year, so you will want to have the new ortho do so.
6) Can son exercise on machines now, at 3 weeks? Yes - stationary bike, elliptical, even treadmill (that seems DANGEROUS to me!) 
Sorry for the book I've written. I can't come here often, as our move is imminent, and so much to do. And I've just had dental discomfort, found mysel a competent dentist, got a temporary crown (it's a molar). And a haircut, which you all know is important to mental health! LOL
So son is doing well, a double hippie like so many of you. I'll still keep an eye on you. Have the THR, you will have the incision pain, and recovery to get through, but it will let you move on with the rest of your life.
Love & Aloha,
Soos

"After 7 months of pain, physical therapy, limping, weakness in my leg, not sleeping, I had an MRI which showed glut tears, labrum tear and lots of arthritis in my hip. 4 days ago I had a diagnostic injection of cortisone and numbing stuff under fluoroscopy deep into the hip joint to separate the glut pain from the arthritis. Getting some relief in weakness and hip pain, but gluts still painful and restrict a full step when walking.  We talked about an anterior hip replacement, which I hear most docs are doing here in the US.  The recovery is shorter and since they don't cut muscles to insert the implant, there is no restrictions or PT after. Scar is hidden by underwear elastic, which would appeal to a younger patient. He said he would repair the tendons at that time.  Question  I can't seem to find any information about how the gluts repairs are sutured to a metal femoral head. I do find info on repairs after THR, but that's 2 surgeries.  I realize every patient is different in the exact tear, size, etc, but I want to know more before I sign up, and the notes I read on this forum and so informed and helpful I hope someone out there has some thoughts or info to share. Thanks

"Well I'm now 7 1/2 weeks post op and continue to be frustrated with my progress. Ok I've had some good things this week, I can drive again and seem to be improving with some of the exercises.
What I really want though is to progress to not using my stick but it's just not happening. I have a problem with pain in the groin (not all the time, usually after my exercises or a long walk) and tightness around my knee which is more prominent around the inner knee area. This tightness stops me from bending my leg adequately to do my exercises correctly. Does anyone know if the 'full' pulling pain I get in my groin is connected to my knee problem? Any pain I had previously in my outer thigh has pretty much gone.
I'm due at my physio this afternoon so I'm going to quiz her again about it, but she didn't give me much confidence last week that she understood what I was saying.
Any advice greatly appreciated ??

"Yesterday I was actually worried about myself.  I was soooo tired.  I was also helping plan a birthday party last night and that probably took lots of attention.  But still I was just feeling bone-tired.
I was low on iron in the year before my surgery.  I had gone to my yearly physical and mentioned that I seemed to be losing tons of hair, especially when shampooing.  Doctor tested iron and I was quite low.  I had been donating blood every two months too -- that showed my hemoglobin was fine....but I guess that doesn't test the iron stores.   My doctor told me to stop donating blood until after surgery and recommended iron supplements from the health food store.
Over the year since I've been taking the iron, my #'s have increased slowly.  Still not normal.  I wonder if they decreased following surgery.
I have my physical scheduled for mid-August so I guess I'll wait til then to see the doctor.          I was wondering about Vitamin B-12 too.
Or.   -- is this exhaustion common with most people?  I'm 6 weeks post op.     It's not horrible I guess but I'm not used to feeling so tired -- and I don't like it!  LOL

My leg is like a dead weight!! All the other exercises are easy by comparison. I'm not sure whether my op was anterior or posterior, but my scar runs up the side of my leg and curves towards my buttock. Guessing this is anterior but my consultant just said the cut will be in your side but I work at the front!! Keep positive hipsters xxxx

Now have to persue the question whether painful knuckles is due to RA developing or the use of crutches which I still need as have a dodgy knee as well. Anyone else experienced thiis?

"Hi guys
I posted here a couple of weeks ago and I haven't really made any progress annoyingly!!!
I had my left hip done anterior approach 6 weeks ago and have had a pain while walking for 4 weeks. I use just one crutch as recommended by my physio and this pain is only on FWB... I thought it was muscular at first, and maybe I had just overdone things but it simple isn't getting any better. I'm very frustrated as it's the only thing that's stopping me from progressing to no crutches any walking normally.
I have another physio appointment next week but when I mentioned it last week she didn't appear to be concerned. I went for an X-ray at my gps but they couldn't see a problem and my consultant appointment isn't for another 2,5 weeks...
Anyone had this pain? Just on weight bear when walking? Any muscle manipulation ideas? Anything????
Please, any help is gratefully received as I'm self employed with 2 small children and am supposed to be easing myself back to work next week!!!
OMG!
Thanks in advance

"a homeopathic doctor recently gave me this advice and I thought I'd share it with my fellow hippies, I've already started to follow this advice I'm 2 weeks post op.
So, this Doctor told me that calcium is very important for healing bones ( my femur also got fractured in my thr surgery), but apparently the body struggles to absorb calcium in tablet form, he suggested the following.
buy some organic eggs, when you have used the eggs wash the shells and then boil them for 10 minutes and leave them overnight to dry, once dry grind them in a pestle and mortar, or better still a coffee grinder or nutribullet if you have one, when they are a fine powder store them in an airtight jar or Tupperware and sprinkle a teaspoon full each day on food maybe your morning porridge, in my case I add a spoonful to my morning smoothie...
As I said I don't know if this works, but it sounds like it should and I have it on good authority that it does.

"My 62yo mom had her THR surgery today which took over 3 hours as she had DDH and a weak bone structure in her left hip. She was given epidural anesthesia and was fine all day after the surgery except a vomit after her first mouth intake of tea and biscuit.
However, unlike many THRs, the doc said they'll make her stand/walk the next morning. Because of this, I'm scared of DVT now. Although they're giving her blood thinners and put some 24/7 blood circulator belts on both her legs (calves I think) and the doc advised her ankle motion exercise on both legs and some other exercise to push the operated leg's thigh downwards and back up (she was having difficulty/pain doing that).
So basically, she's fine with the pain, etc but they didn't make her leg mobile today itself. Did all of you guys stand on Day 1 itself?

"Im 10 days post op following what should have been a straightforward hip replacement has been complicated because the femur got fractured in surgery.
Im feeling really disappointed, this is such a blow as I cannot weight bare on my right let, I'm also in a lot of pain from the fracture, the leg feels very heavy and I'm using a Zimmer frame, which is all very different to my expectation of getting home and pottering around on 2 and then later one crutch. 
I have had to have my bed moved downstairs into the front room as stairs are not an option at least for the 6 weeks that I can't put my right foot on the ground. 
Im concerned that the rehabilitation for each problem are sort of counter productive, and I feel like when I can weight bear I will have set back my hip rehabilitation.
im in the UK and am hoping that a physio will visit me weekly as I'm effectively housebound, I'm a single Mum to a 13 year old boy who is on school holiday at the moment, so he is helping me out , but of course I feel bad to expect to much of him, I've given him the role of my personal trainer to make things a bit more fun...
lim really scared that I will end up never getting the type of mobility that I had hoped for because of the fracture putting a spanner in the works.
apparently the femur splitting in surgery happens to 2% of patients ( now they tel me)... Has this happened to anybody else who could offer me a advice or reassurance. I'm a 47 yr old female.

"My femoral nerve was damaged 12 months ago. I had a straightforward THR, but it slipped out ( no fall, nothing) after 3 nights and following the revision, my femoral nerve was damaged. Athough I could 'feel' more after 4 months, I was on crutches for 6 months, unable to drive for 5. Then it seemed to improve, until the knee suddenly swelled up horribly and felt scarily unstable. I had an MRI scan, waited ages for the result and it seems that the swelling is just fat, which is simply more noticeable because my quads and VMO have atrophied so badly because of the femoral nerve injury. Has anybody else had the same experience? Can anybody tell me how long it took for the quads and VMO to start working again? Which exercises worked?
12 months on, I can walk without crutches on flat ground, but as I also have chronic arthritis in the knee on the opposite leg ( needed a replacement knee years ago, but they said I was too young...I'm only 54), I cannot walk very far or stand for long without intense pain and discomfort. Steps are hell and I have to use my arms to pull/support me. Luckily, I can cycle, which I do every day. But I'm becoming extremely depressed. Trying hard to have a PMA, but  it's hard when I'm the only person I know who has been through this. Sick of people's eyes glazing over when I try to explain what's happened to me. I would like to meet and chat with others who have/are going through the same thing. The consultants are no help at all when it comes to dealing with our emotional state. I live on my own by the way, and am self employed so no sickness benefits.

I have heard that leg length difference is common with this surgery so I'm worried it will be a permanant issue. Did anyone else have this problem and it did return to normal after swelling was gone or do you think it will stay the same?

"Yes, my son has joined your club - 2 hips done in 4 months! The story of what happened to make the doctor change his mind will have to wait for another time.
Each hip experience is SO different. I think it took son THREE MONTHS to emerge from the fog because of general anesthesia AND he was in such a debilitated condition prior to surgery. But, he didn't have much incision pain. He had a spinal this time, and instead of taking four hours to be conscious enough to leave, he had clarity in an hour, and along with it, pain. 
But today he has not taken any narcotics, but did feel a bit hungover this morning. He is taking acetaminophen and naproxen. 
Yesterday, he went to a meeting on campus and walked 6 blocks to and from. He was not in pain, but he was so tired and had discomfort. It was 95F feels like 108 yesterday. He is not walking properly - stride to short - but does not use his cane. sigh. Today he went for a deep tissue massage, and thought it helped.
Hippies, if you've had a bad allergic reaction to oxycodone, DO NOT LET THEM GIVE IT TO YOU AGAIN! Son had the waterfall sweats, itching and dizziness from this with the first hip. So he told everyone he could he did not want this. Instead they gave him a low dose of hydromorphone. After ten days, we started splitting them. Yes, we know you're not supposed to. We even split the oxycontin. It just made it easier to taper off.
Here's the downside: with all that clarity comes worry. And the crazy busyness involves us moving out of the present apartment into interim accomodations while his belongings go to the west coast. Who knew they have a hospital rate? We'll stay in them for a month, then fly away from this place. I am going crazy trying to find a short-term place to stay there, as well as an apartment for son to rent. Yesterday I asked a friend there for help, and he has already come through with some ideas. Unlike this place where people smile and say things, but could care less.
Okay, sorry TMI. Just how do you hippies recover alone? With meds to figure out, dressing to change, cooking and eating? At least my son has a personal assistant to do the laundry, and today she vacuumed and mopped! That would be ME! 
Son has an appointment with the surgeon Monday. The nurse who took his staples out kindly set it up as we are leaving so soon. Son is worried that there is Leg Length Discrepancy. And there is a hematoma to be aspirated. 
Hope you are all doing well, and not bored to death. 
Aloha, Soos

Will I just leave it as I'm going to see the surgeon next Monday about my other hip replacement or should I go to the Drs?

"Hi everyone not been on here for a while which is always a good sign. Just wanted to share with you I have just returned from 8 nights in Spain and had a fantastic time.
I was able to walk about free from the nagging arthritis pain I actually got a blister on my foot i walked that much.
I totally forgot I'd even had my operation. I'm so grateful I've been given this opportunity of a new hip and despite my dark early days sleepless nights etc it has been pretty much a great recovery.
I returned to work at 7 weeks and did experience some pain in the early days but that has gone now.
I get occasional reminders of my operation and still struggle to fasten my shoes on my operated leg but life couldn't be better.
Wishing you all a great recovery and remember it will be worth every sleepless night pain and swelling in the end.
Thank you to everyone who helped me through my early weeks this is a fantastic forum so glad I found it.

"Hello
I'm from India and my 62 yo mom has a complex THR surgery for her DDH hip today and after reading about joint infections online, I'm a little worried of passing my cold (been sneezing since 2 days) on to her anytime during this period. Should I avoid going to her room or something before and/or after the operation? Or can I be in the room and just not touch her or something?
I'm also worried about my aunt who stayed with her overnight in the hospital before the surgery because she has just recovered from a respiratory infection that started a month ago. She's still taking her meds but seems alright now, but I'm still worried if that is dangerous for my mom.
I don't want her to get any sort of infection because of me or someone else.
Also, what other precautions should we take regarding the 20+ family visitors we are expecting to come see her today after surgery?
Thank you so much.

"Having wavered forever I  now have a date for my hip replacement.
After consulting 3 different surgeons who all recommended THR I have finally made the decision.
Because unlike most people I have not been in serious pain, I was reluctant to undergo a serious operation.
I have been told that my problem is a joint deformity which prevents me from standing upright.I walk with a nasty limp bent over and leaning to one side.
This is not a good look and also limits how far I can walk without becoming exhausted. Pain sets in after 15-20 mins and hip sometimes gives way without warning.
I hope I have made the right decision to go ahead.
My op. date is 29th September.
Now I am panicking !! So much to consider,How will I dress myself,put on trousers/knickers/socks/trainers?How will I wash and dry my feet?
Will I be able to make my bed? Access food in under counter frig?
Climb in and out of bath? My shower is over bath!
The 90 degree rule scares me to death, how to be sure I won't bend too far,just getting up from a chair or out of bed I seem to lean forward for leverage. 
Thank goodness for this wonderful forum with ready responses to every query however daft it might seem to non hippies.
Thank you all for just being there!!

"Hello lovely hippies!
5 weeks today I was setting nervously off to the hospital!
Yesterday drove my car for the first time, went and filled up with petrol and bought a few essential items - yes wine and crisps!
can get in and out no problems. Walking without stick or limp!
managing stepping up stairs with my operated leg once I have got moving. Down to one anti inflammatory a day (for my other hip!)
no painkillers. 
Walking up to two miles most days. 
Still have some discomfort, butt pain and soreness/ tenderness around the wound site. So when I rest I get my feet up and apply ice. Think lounging on raised sofa binge watching House of Cards on Netflicks!
Back to cooking for the whole family, washing and a bit of half hearted cleaning. Have told husband I am not allowed to use the vacuum cleaner for at least three years!!!!!
I am so glad to have had the opportunity of this surgery and will not hesitate to have the other hip done as soon as it needs it. 
Even the Spinal which I was worried about ( thanks for all your reassuring comments!) was brilliant. Will have it again. 
To be honest the whole thing has been easier than I thought, although I have had my moments it has definitely been worth it. 
Thank you all, I am so glad I found this forum. 
Thank you Graham for your Laymans Guide. It is a realy good resource. 
One more week of hip precautions/ restrictions and I realy don't mind. 
Take care all new hippies, go slowly and steadily we all want our brand new hips to last as long as possible. 
As mine is uncemented I felt I needed to give it time to ""bed"" in and for bone to grow, I don't think you can rush that. 
Think I am rambling on a bit now.

"Hi Everyone
Having now commited to a THR I decided to try to prepare myself for after the op.
Since I understand that after surgery sleeping on the back is necessary for some weeks I decided to start now and get used to it.
The result was lower back pain while in bed plus a headache as well as the back pain on waking up in the morning.
I have experienced little pain from my hip OA and never been kept awake by the OA .Now I am concerned about potential damage to my back.
Any advice about how to cope with the back pain?
Also for how long must the back sleeping be kept up?
Many thanks

"It's 3.48 in the morning and I'm sat on the edge of the bed yet again, trying to take the pressure off my lower back (it's reminiscent of the arthritis pain I had pre op if I was on my back - couldn't tolerate being on my back then either) I've been sleeping in the recliner downstairs for 6 weeks now and wonder if I've slept there too long which is now affecting my ability to sleep in bed. As I sat here I wonder what I should do...stick it out here so I get used to it or go downstairs again ??
I just cannot stay on my back all night, as I am getting lower back which of course is worse on my operated side.
What kind of mattress is more suitable? I've got a posturpaedic but I've got a soft mattress topper and I wonder if I should take this off and just on the mattress itself.
This is so frustrating I feel like crying!!!

"Hi All,
Today is my 5 week hip birthday.  I'm starting to feel stronger and like I might get back to (new) normal!  I've started walking around my home without the cane.  With every step, I really squeeze my glute and it seems to help.  No pain and it makes me feel much steadier.
My skin reaction to the dressing still hurts some but is better.  It evidently wasn't a rash but it really burned through a few layers of skin.  Ouch.  No wonder it hurt.  There's still a 3"" section that is a bit blistered but the rest looks healed.  I guess it will always be discoloured which is a bit of a bummer (pun intended!).  But at least it's getting better and never got infected.
I go to see the Physio next Friday for my 6-week check up and I'm hoping I'll get the OK to drive.  Getting a little tired of relying on friends to drive me around!
Love this forum.  Hugs,

"hi. I had a TRHR in February 2015 and have healed well - basically had my life back for a good few months.I know I need the left doing and my GP has agreed to refer me to the same consultant when I think I'm ready to face another operation. 
With my right side all the pain was in the groin area and I managed to cope without painkillers in the most part. With my left I do have occasional groin pain (if I've overdone it) but mainly I have lower back pain which can come on without warning and is incapacitating.   Has anyone else had this kind of pain? Is it hip related? Any advice welcome as to be honest even trying to get a GP appointment makes me feel weak and panicked (last time I made one I had to wait three and a half weeks).

"Hello everyone, I just found out a few days ago that I will need a LTHR. Apparently I have congenital hip dysplasia. I moved to Bolivia over two years ago and have done heavy uphill/downhill walking every day, which sped up the deteriation in my hip. I have to leave my husband and two small children in a few weeks and head back home (U.S.A) for the surgery since the technology here isn't the greatest.
Questions: what things have you found the most helpful in preparing for surgery and recovery (cold pack, body pillow, sleeing in a large bed vs a twin sized bed etc.) I'll be staying with my parents and they have said they will get anything I need so that I am comfortable and have the best recovery. I know everyone's stories and experiences have been different - but do you think I can be in good enough condition to travel from the US to Bolivia (19 hour flight with layovers) in 10-12 weeks?
Also, does anyone else have hip dysplasia? What have you done as far as preventative measures?
I'm really nervous about this, mostly about leaving my babies. Daddy still works full time and my kids are homeschooled while living abraod...this is going to be challenging!

"I had a total right hip replacement 8mnths ago and I was absolutely fine. Until 2weeks ago. Out the corner of my eye I saw a mouse and my first reaction was to quickly put my foot on it...I have no idea why I did this but I quickly turned my foot (and of course my leg followed) out to a 90degree angle when I had the most severe pain in the top of my leg. I couldn't put any weight on it, I couldn't move, all I could do was stand there yelping and swearing for about a minute until the pain lessened enough for me to lay on the bed. After 10mins I got up and could walk about and move as normal but I've had a dull pain ever since in the cheek of my bum and in the top of my groin. Has this happened to anyone else?

"Hi all: Just thought I would update my situation. I am now 12 weeks post op but having a lot of back pain, pain in both hips and legs plus headaches. This was rough as after last week, when I went on a great hike, I thought I was at the breakthrough stage.
Anyway, after much pain, worry and discomfort, I went to Emergency and luckily my own M.D. was the physician on site.
My x rays are fine. He thinks I have some issues with soft tissue related to misalignment of my hips and my body's over compensation by my right side muscles and tendons, now causing pain and inflammation of both hips, legs and hips. So, I have a prescription for pain meds Tramadone, advised to rest for a few days and then get back to exercising and healing.
I have set up an appointment with the Orthpaedic surgeon for Thursday.
For other hippies, I am echoing Maloo's advice not to overdo it.
Also, if you think something is not right in your recovery, go see the Orthopaedic surgeon or your M.D.

"I haven't been as addicted to this site lately. I guess the more normal I have felt, the less I relied on the rest of you to reassure me that  the process I was going through was  normal. 
I've just been reading some posts this morning, realising that those of us who are several weeks post op are way too impatient. I am recognising myself in almost everything that other people are saying. 
I was talking to my sister last night , saying that I felt all misaligned somewhere around my pelvis and my lower back. Her first comment was ' have you asked on your hippie forum? '  the trouble is I know it's caused by a combination of spending a whole day at work, longer dog walks and probably using the carpet cleaner !!! Well I've only myself to blame if I am now having to re-align all my bits and bobs! 
So Lesson learned, I am having a restful day today( now that I have fulfilled fog walking duty) I go for my check up on Wednesday .
joy of joy though - I have managed to have a bath - the joy of wallowing in hot bubbles.  I so missed that pleasure.
so the moral of this story is 'don't do too much too soon' , 'don't run before you can walk' , 'all things in moderation' , and don't abandon the forum, because there are wise and experienced people on here who can put all your problems into perspective !!
have a good day  everyone.

However since Sunday my operated sides groin has been very sore... Sore when walking and moving about. I'm still on 2 crutches (seeing physio next Tuesday) but am concerned as to what I should/should not be doing!!!
I've read sbout iliopsoas tendinitis and have done the bed test but that isn't too painful tbh! It's sorer just stretched out on the bed (ie the muscle feels taught when I'm laid flat).

"Hi everyone, I'm just wondering where I am in terms of recovery. I don't see my consultant until 12 weeks so it feels a bit isolating on your own. This is what I am doing: walking with one crutch - 10 mins X 5 a day, exercises X 10 of each 4 X a day (standing leg raises, half squats, standing abductors etc)
I have tried walking unaided and I'm just too wobbly. I had a terrible limp prior to surgery and I feel as though I'm having to relearn everything. I've got swelling around my knee and also around my outer thigh (above and below the incision) the incision itself looks fine. I'm 49 and go back to work at the beginning of Sept. I'm impatient to drive but there doesn't seem much hope of that yet. I'm seeing physio for the first time next week. It will be a relief just to speak to someone about it. Many thanks

"Hi All, 
My last post was almost a year ago, I was going to have my left hip replaced, that finally happen in November. I felt better after talking to you all and the warmth and extreme knowledge of you all has me posting again. 
I知 back because that total left hip replacement only went well the first 3 months. After those 3 months I took a turn for the worse. I started to get pain in my femur where the replacement is. After many X-rays and 4 or 5 months (each weeks getting worse) my Dr was not able to see the problem. So last month he sent me for a triple bone scan and an MRI. Both showed my bone was not growing into the prostatic on the top part as well as the bottom of it (where most of my pain is). This should have happen within the first 6 weeks. My bone is bruising in those areas. Walking was and still is a big problem but now i get the pain even when laying down sleeping at night. So he strongly suggested I get it replaced again, he also told me to get a second opinion so I know 100% that痴 the correct diagnosis. I知 scheduled for that second opinion on Aug 12th at the Hospital of special surgery in New York. Im 40 and 2 young children and really need to be part of their lives as in sports and just playing with them. This is way to young to have all these problems. My pain is worse now then before I had the surgery?
My question is to you all. 
-Is this really a 1% chance that happen to me like my Dr said?
-Has anyone else had this and how did you address it? How are you today? 
-What are the odds the second replacement will work this time?
-Is this my fault, my Dr or is this just par for the course? 
What am i missing? Any advise would be appreciated if you have been down the same road. 
As always thanks for being here for people like me when we go through this journey in life.

1.  What can I expect as far as being limber/flexible a year or two after surgery?  Will I be able to bend over and tie my shoes, squat down to pick something up, etc?  I'm thinking longer term, a year or two down the road.
2.  Is the 90 degree rule a short term restriction or a lifettime restriction?
3.  On average, how close does one get back to pre arthritis physical abilities?
3.  Is there a person that has had a bilateral that wouldn't mind me emailing them with specific questions about recovery?
I'm 51 and hope to be able to work another 15 years after surgery.  My post surgery abilities worry me.
Thanks so much.

"Thanks Linda for the acronym. 
I have practiced moving like this before my surgery tomorrow and I find it so hard to do. I am worried about it more than the surgery itself.
Anyone have any pointers for me? I need input on this.

"The x-ray on my right hip shows severe degeneration: and I have pain when I walk it more than a short distance, and it often wakes me up at night. However I can still get in and out of the bath and up and down stairs, look after myself at home and generally drive the car do my shopping and all the other tasks My question is this: I live on my own, I am 17 years old and I am worried about how I will manage after discharge from the operation. I do not have a walk-in shower, only one over the boss: and I am not sure just how I will manage for the first couple of weeks on my own. I live in Northamptonshire if that's any help to anyone who knows what help is available. Thank you

"Please excuse my ignorance, but what does the pre op entail?
I see that all the forum members from the UK have this before surgery, but I can't work out what it actually means.
I live in France and before the surgery here we have to go through a series of tests ie. dentist, cardiologist (if necessary),
X_rays, blood tests and anaethetist appointment. These all have to be arranged by the patient and in a certain order.

"I知 very pleased to report that recovery is going well.  I am managing to walk unaided in the house  most of the time, and have a walking stick for when I知 feeling tired and need a bit of help.
I still tire easily and am only managing to work a couple of hours a day (followed by a snooze), but that痴 mainly because I work for myself, so I don稚 get paid if I don稚 work.  The tiredness is decreasing and I hope that by the time my 6 weeks are up I should be working longer, but will have to wait and see.
I知 also managing to sleep on my operated side now for most of the night, which has dramatically increased the quality of my sleep.  I do not sleep well on my back! I am looking forward to being able to sleep on my good side (my usual side) in a couple of weeks (hopefully).
Physiotherapy  unfortunately I知 not in an area which automatically schedules physiotherapy and as I was concerned that I wasn稚 doing the exercises correctly, I sought professional advice.  Though the physio was polite, she agreed that I wasn稚 doing the exercises properly and she gave me a couple of others to do as well (see separate discussion).  Not cheap as the physio had to come to my house, but well worth it.  I will continue with further sessions once I can drive.
To those who are waiting for their op and are nervous (so was I, see my very first discussion), quite simply having the op was one of the best things that I致e ever done.  I have gone from being in constant pain and barely able to walk to being able walk upright, with very limited short term pain.  I also know that this pain is only the result the operation and will stop - hopefully in the very near future.
My thanks to this forum once again for all it's support and useful information.

"Hi, just discovered this forum. I had THR 6 days ago and have been home 2 days. I am 54. Lying flat on back with leg stretched out is very painful. I suppose it is due to tendons and muscles stretching which haven't been used for some time. I am not able to take strong painkillers so restricted to paracetemol. Sleeping is difficult as leg gets too sore and irritable after a couple hours. Advice please. Thanks

"I'm having right THR on Tuesday July 19. But last September I was having pain on the right side going from my butt down my leg. My Dr. sent me to the pain management clinic, where I had a series of 5 spinal epidurals which didn't help.
I then went to my neurosurgeon and he said my sciatic nerve was pinched on the right side and I would need back surgery to fix it. But he said I would need to get my hip fixed first.
That's when I finally went to the Orthopedic Dr. and he discovered I had no space between the ball and joint on the right side, my left side is good.
So I'm wondering if I get this right hip replacement that maybe since I won't  walk ""like a duck"" afterwards, maybe that will alleviate the sciatic nerve being pinched..
Thoughts please....

"From what I have learned infection is a big worry especially as the prosthesis as a foreign body, unlike natures own joints, cannot self heal and the damage from infection to surrounding tissue is a  very serious problem.
I am especially worried because I have that age condition of thin papery skin which bleeds so easily at the slightest knock ,with patches of blood and bruises under the skin. Even tucking the sheets in on my bed can cause the skin to split and bleed.
I also have had several root canal treatments,the latest of which has never felt quite right.
I understand that infection can enter the blood supply via cuts,root canal treatments even hygienist tooth cleaning.
I get regular check-ups and 6 monthly hygienist care,but I am still quite anxious about this problem.
Do any of you have any experience or wisdom to offer on this topic?
Many thanks in advance. I have learned so much on this amazing site so hope for some enlightenment on this subject.
Hope you are all doing well whatever stage you are at.
Best wishes everybody

"Good morning All.  Today is my new hip's 4-week birthday!  I feel like I'm progressing well.  I still walk with a cane or a crutch inside my condo.  Outside I use a walker.  I've been advised to keep using the walker to ensure that I don't develop a limp.  I limped for so long before that surgery, they don't want that old muscle-memory to take over.  
I have very little pain (and now the rash is subsiding).  If I try walking without a cane, I just feel a bit scared I think.  Or not the most stable.  So there is probably still some weakness to muscles.  I do my exercises regularly and I do 3 - 10 minute walks each day -- either up and down my condo hallway or outside.  No pain!!!!
I see my surgeon next week.  We'll do new X-rays so it will be interesting to see those and to hear what he has to say.
One of the best things about this recovery has been this forum.  So helpful.  Hugs to all,
Leslie

Would like to ask opinions on using my crutch. I have not used it outside for the last wk. I went out last nt and took it with me, (just in case) I ended up using it walking home. I found it a lot easier I wasn't limping as much as I do without it and could walk a lot quicker. Should I go bk to using it or struggle on without it. I'm 11 wks p.o. so should I be crutch free at this stage of recovery?
Have a good day,

It is unfortunately the one I smashed  to bits falling down the pub steps when going in !! three years ago for lunch, and it and my lower leg are held together with metalwork! Elevating it is difficult because I presently have pain in the knee also from where the leg was manipulated during the recent surgery.

I feel pretty good, walking with a cane and going to physical therapy twice a week. I am still tentative about my operated leg and have heard everything from : it's very difficult to dislocate , it will happen if you bend over, you're not out of the woods for 6 to 8 months, etc. etc. we are all anxious to get on with our lives but even though I can put my shoes and socks on, perhaps I shouldn't be doing that yet? Does anyone have a good answer for this question? It's driving me crazy! Lol.  Thanks Cindy

"This skin reaction I have had to the dressing covering my incision is still the worst part of recovery for me (surgery June 17).   I had the stapes removed and the reaction discovered July 7, one week ago today.  It seemed to be improving a bit but not lots.  A woman in my building is a nurse so I asked her to take a look and she thought it wasn't too bad but might be time for a cortisone cream.  So after many calls I finally got my family doctor to phone in a prescription and this nurse picked it up for me.  So far I can't say there is a dramatic improvement but I've only applied the cream twice so I need to give it time.  I have to be very careful to put just a thin layer on and they don't want it close to the incision because of chance of infection.....which really scares me!  Anyway, with luck this will be cleared up in the next while.

From what I read on here there are many of us with major problems following THR's so my question is, Are we not shouting loudly enough to let the world know that having a replacement joint doesn't always work out?

"I'm muddling along until I have both hips replaced in December. I don't manage to do a lot besides work and a little housework or life errands. I just had my hips injected with cortisone about couple of weeks ago so I'm not limping as badly but still move more like an 96 year old than my 56. I belong to a gym that offers warm water classes and try to fit one in a week if possible. I'm a night shift NICU nurse so the 12 hour shifts kinda do me in pretty often. I went to a 45 minute Aqua Zen class yesterday, lots of stretching and breathing, usually pretty relaxing. I then went to visit my older sister and her husband. Both are in poor health, I sat and visited with them for a couple of hours. Not sure if it was class or sitting or the combination but my hips hurt so badly I came home and took a tramadol and sat down to rest. Still painful through part of the night and tired and achy today. Fun times will be had at work tonight. Just wondering if anyone has any suggestions for anything I might try next time this happens. I wondered about ice but didn't really have anything that would ice the area. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Just gotta get through until December then hopefully recovery on the other side will have pain-free hips at the end of that journey however long it may be.

"Helloo, had a bilateral hip replacement 2 weeks ago and wondered how others got on with recovery?
I'm actually feeling great, get a headache every so often and sore lower back but sleeping well and mobility going ok. Still on 2 crutches which I imagine will be the case for a while. I'm meant to be doing a 2 day course next week and I'm not sure if it'll be too much... I'm self employed.
Looking forward to hearing others experiences. I'm 45 years old.

"Hi again, I had two hip replacements done 6 weeks ago tomorrow. I'm looking for some advice from others that have had two done. Just wondering at 6 weeks what kind of exercises you were doing, how much walking you were doing and just how things were in general?
The reason I am asking is I'm not seeing my surgeon for another 2 weeks and feel I could have benefitted from seeing him now at 6 weeks.

"Hi, I have both my hips replaced (cementless, ceramic on ceramic) , one is 1,5 yo and other is 7 months ago and I am willing to do some exercises with following machines with some weight (actually I am doing already twice a week for last 2 months);
-Leg Extension Machine
-Leg Curl Machine
-Seated Abductor and Adductor Machine
Some sources say that is ok and even recommended, some say to avoid them or avoid weight and I am totally confused. I appreciate if you guys have any experience or a reliable source/knowledge ? I am 42 btw.

"Greetings from Sunny, hot, North Carolina, USA !
Jan 2013, I had the posterior THR with great success.  July 25th, I am having my other hip replaced with the same posterior technique.
I am curious what are the advantages if any of the anterior approach ?  I do know the rehab is much quicker with anterior technique.
I have no intention of changing the type of surgery.
i guess, I will be a full fledge hippie soon !
Good Luck to all !!

I am having Physio ,Hydro Therapy, and I also go to water aerobics when I can. I still need to use a stick when I am out in the street, and when I go shopping I am finding that the time I get public transport, I am extremely tired to walk around shops.
i am also suffering from PPS (Post Polio Syndrome) before I had my THR my Nuerologist did say to me that I would take much longer than the average person to get over THR. At the time I didn't really no what he ment, but I do now. What Nerve endings I have are not very strong, because of the Polio that I had. Today I feel really down in the dumps, because I have always been fairly active, but I don't seem to have any pleasure in going out. Just hope this goes. Due to go back to Surgeon in August, to discuss how I am and also to sort out about having my TKR done ?? Not looking forward to that at all.One more thing, after all this time I still can not lay on the operated side, is anyone else like this after nearly 5 mths. Speak soon

"I had my left THR on June 17 -- two weeks ago today!  My surgeon prescribed Oxycodone for pain and I got 200 5mg tabs.  I've been taking one tab every 4-5 hours since surgery.  My plan was to stay on that regime until I see my surgeon next Thursday.   Yesterday I had lunch with two friends who are nurses.  They both thought I should get off Oxycodone.  That it is too strong to be on for so long.  I have very little pain but that might be because I've been taking Oxy on a regular basis, not waiting until I felt like I needed it.    The surgeon also prescribed Tramadol and said when I thought I didn't need Oxycodone, I could start taking Tramadol.  I guess I assumed since he prescribed 200 tabs of the Oxy, he figured that I would be taking it for quite a while.  That would be like 5 weeks at least I think.  Would love to hear what others have done regarding pain meds and if you have any opinions about whether I should stay on Oxy or move down to the Tramadol.  Thanks.

"hi all.  I have been for my 1 month check up today.  My specialist said I have made an excellent recovery so far.  He wants me to keep using the one crutch while outdoors for another two weeks but I'm ok to walk unaided indoors.  So I will do as I'm told and listen to the expert.  He said I'm fine to sleep on the operated side but not the good side for the time being.   I can drive and also start swimming the front crawl which I'm really pleased about as swimming is my thing . Also I can go on the static bike and cross trainer.  So, I'm really pleased with myself and looking forward to getting on with my recovery.  I Have to go back again in a months time to see the specialist again.   I know we are all recovering at different rates and different doctors have different ideas but just wanted to report back to you all. It's a long journey we're all on and I want to wish you all the best and here's hoping for a full recovery for us all. Xx

so now, I have found a solution to two of these issues!
using a long pillow either side, or two firm regular pillows in line,on each side of me, I wrap a double duvet over each side and lie in the middle.  Because the duvet is raised to the pillow heights on both sides, it hardly touches the body, creating a space that is cool during the night and is easier to turn over.
turning over efficiently is a problem I have not yet solved...........

"Sorry I've been MIA - probably been weeks since I've been on here. Been 4 months since son's LTHR. When he went for his 6 week check he had an MRI which showed the start of Avascular Necrosis in his right hip. He was devastated. He survived going to a conference 2 flights and a total of eleven hours away. Some conference days were 9 hours long, and he needed his cane and was knackered at the end of them. But I was so proud to hear his presentation and the confidence he showed in knowing his subject, as well as answering questions. 
I learned (after being too long on the phone with some ignorant insurance people and not from them) that the surgery program he qualifies for does not even require preauthorization because as soon as he's had enough time out of surgery & anesthesia, he doesn't stay in the hospital. Instead, we go across the highway to a hotel and recover there for 2 nights. Here's a slightly different plan, and if the link doesn't pass the moderators, you can search for ""hotel recovery for hip replacement surgery"". 
http://www.buffalonews.com/business/patients-get-a-recovery-suite-not-a-hospital-bed-after-this-new-joint-replacement-surgery-20150613
The nurse is either down the hall or in the adjoining room. This is only for patients who are otherwise healthy, don't have cardiac issues and not covered by Medicare. A hotel room is preferable to a shared hospital room. You must have someone stay with you - poor son, his mother is his roommate! The nurse does check those squeezy electronic socks, make you cough & use the spirometer, take temperature & blood pressure & administer meds. And room service is Caesar salad, a burger & fries, or eggs and bacon!
Son is scared. NOT of the surgery (I am too much of a sissy to watch it in real time on video screens!) but the RECOVERY. Like many of you, he still gets VERY tired, being out and about for too long will mean he needs a full next day of rest.
Not sure how much I can be here, as it is T-6 days. And counting. I see your posts and try to vote on them. And I am thinking of you all. I don't know your pain, but I see my son's. The struggle is real.
P.S. - someday I will tell the story of how we got the surgeon to say yes.
Love, Soos

"I realized that my anterior scar was beginning to create a low ridge and that I had some pain in my affected leg.  I have been using lotion and castor oil and deep massage to break down the tightness of scar ridge.  I have also enlisted the help of my PT to help with deep linear and circular massage along the scar line.  This has signficantly reduced pain in that area and added to the flexibility of my right leg.  I didn't connect the thickening scar ridge to discomfort I was experiencing in my leg until I realized the quick rate at which the scar was thickening in height.

"Hello lovelies!
i have changed my picture as I decided I did not like the last one. 
This is me on my 50th Birthday Skiing in Tignes. 18 months ago. 
I also managed skiing last Xmas. Only six months ago!
I am not offered Physio for my recovery,I am thinking of getting some Sports Physio after 6 weeks. 
Do you think it is too ambitious to think I could manage some ""old lady"" Skiing in 6 months. Really don't want to jeopardise my lovely new hip but hate to think my Skiing days might be over. 
So far I am being very cautious as my new hip is uncemented and I want it to ""bed"" in well, so just doing recommended exercises, and lots of rest. 
More rest than I probably need as I keep falling asleep!
it will be two weeks tomorrow since I had the LTHR. I think the worst is over and I am starting to feel really very hopefull for the future, I am sure me and my new hip will have great times together!
Take care all.

"Hi All,
This forum has, more than anything else, provided me with clarity and resolve for the operation I am booked in for in August. Thanks.
There is really only one thing playing on my mind now. That is I am wondering how well one can expect the soft tissue to repair post op.
I understand that during my operation several muscles will be split including the gluteus maximus and fascia lata. These muscles will be stitched up afterwards. Generally speaking can you expect these muscles to heal back to normal or will there be internal scaring or some permanent injury to the muscles post op?
Actually there are two things playing on my mind. The second is that I am a little scared of the general anaesthetic.

Through my reading I have become very keen on the dual mobility prothesis. My surgeon's view seemed to be that the only benefit was a reduced chance of dislocation. He felt that a sufficiently deep cup would confer the same benefits.
From my reading I thought that there were additional advantages including a higher possible level of activity after full recovery and increased range of movement. Is this true?

"Well i thought id do a quick update story for all the newbies and anyone whose after a long read xD
Well I was born on the 7th of Feb 1996 (That makes me 20 years old now) in Sunderland hospital which is also the hospital I go to for my medical stuff.
3rd October 1996; Diognosed with congenital hip dysplasia
1997; 3 surgeries
1998; Removal of metal work operation and another seperate surgery
2001;3 surgeries
2004; surgery
2007;removal of growing plate in right knee
2008;Removal of growing plate in right knee
11th April 2016; Complex thr, hip lowering and muscle lengthening
I also forgot completely that before this surgery i had avascular necrosis, i only remembered when my physio mentioned it when she read my notes, mind you im sick of health care professionals saying 'my, your young for a hip replacement' you work in medcine, you should no life isnt simple xD
so iv got surgery on the 30th of June provided nothing goes wrong, i will be having my right collar bone snapped and pin and plated and a piece of myright hip will be removed and inserted in the collar bone. This means i have to come off my crutches very quickly, im not ready but no choice. My pain levels are still ridicuously high in the operated hip and i think my back has been made worse and obvs still needing double knee replacments in the future because of the OA. Im using no crutches in the house but my gait is horrendous but the more i do it im sure it will improve, one crutch on short journeys and 2 on long journeys like tomorrow when i go to the metro centre for the first time since surgery without my wheelchair. Very nervous and excited.
So 2 days ago I went on a bus ride to a local shop to get food for the lizards, i wason crutches and the bus driver had parked quite far away from the curb so it was a very high step to get onto the bus, he made no attempt to help me or lower the bus. That was the first thing that annoyed me, so i paid and began walking to my seat whenthe driver pulls away before I had gotten to my seat, i flew forward and caught onto one of the poles but twisted my leg and hip which was agony. Anyone else noticed that bus drivers are incredibly ignorant?

"I was wondering is their a time limit on how long before a person can or is able to lay on their good side or stomach? I have tried a few times to lay on my good side (with pillow between legs), but can only lay like that for a few minutes and my leg starts hurting in the thigh, femur area and sometimes all the way down to the knee or foot. Last night I attempted to lay on my stomach for the first time and after a few minutes pain in the thigh, femur and also a even more severe pain in the pelvic area. I had never had this pain before so thought I better turn back over. I am just curious, and I don't know if it is from the hip (think the femur pain is) or from the fact that I also had a fractured pelvis that the surgeon had to repair...so tired of trying to sleep on my back and also have a bad left hip that I have to get replaced soon, and it is so bad that laying on my back makes that hip hurt in the buttock area....Seems like I can't win and no matter how I lay I hurt....Thanks Barb

"I went for hopefully my next to last set of hip injections ever. I have one more appointment scheduled for the last of September. At this appointment we scheduled my surgery. Yeah! I will get 2 brand new hips at noon on December 19th. I attend Joint class on November 28th. That's where I find out what to expect and have pre- and post explained to me. I have my prescription for lovenox injections afterwards. It's starting to sound real and there is a plan in place. I am an notorious planner so this also makes me feel better. Reading the posts here do lots towards decreasing my anxiety about this. I save the getting nervous for closer to the event ??

"Hi lovely fellow hipsters
8 weeks post left lateral thr . Saw consultant last week and he Is really pleased with progress and an go back to work in 4 weeks. My penguin waddle has gone now and walking without a stick with only a slight limp. No thanks to the terrible physio service - one 20 min visit at 3 weeks- I have had to google advanced exercises to strengthen my glutes - only seen progress with waddle on the last 3 weeks through self exercises and pure determination. I've started swimming now - breast stroke coming along nicely and no pain when doing it. I still take the odd cocodamol on a daily basis for muscle pain and because my right hip aches - mild arthritis - but all good now. Wish I hadn't left it so long before I had the surgery . It's been a difficult journey and not an enjoyable one but now I can see the full benefits. I have 4 weeks now to concentrate on strengthening my new hip up - as even tho I'm walking unaided my leg does tire easily.
Hope all you guys are getting on well too

"Hi new and old hippies,
?Those who know me on this forum will know that my right THR was done in Feb 2015, in  Exeter, having had a Birmingham resurfacing in 2005 in Oxford on my left hip.
?Generally made excellent progress, including walking in scotland last month, at 15 months. I was also literally on brink of 5K parkrun this month too
then
Hamstring tear, second level of seriousness, ooooch - frightened I'd got hip probs damage of maybe dislocation etc - but physio reassuring that i'd be in agony if so! All feels like a month postTHR  op now!
?So, sharing that these thing do happen, do set one back, but recoverable on my two healthy hips. Now back to walking my 6K steps a day, tho getting onto the floor and up still painful.
slow but sure! jogging planned for next month maybe, and that 5K run in August, but with physio blessing only.
Bye bye

"Hi everyone, I am a 20 year old student who is finishing up a finance degree and is scheduled for two total hip replacements during summer break. I have had difficulty finding anyone around my age who has ever been in a similar situation, but I would certainly like to hear from a younger person who has experienced THP.
I was reluctant at first to have the operation done, as I would prefer to work in finance over the summer, but my surgeon believes I will not have much of a choice. Right now, even things like standing in a line or walking a rather short distance requires a lot out of me. I was diagnosed with a rare form of skeletal dyspepsia back in 2002, after years of testing to find a diagnosis for my pain. My cartilage has mostly worn away, and my pelvic bone has grown in an abnormal shape. The left joint replacement will be a specially engineered joint because the standard artificial joints will not fit correctly.
Fortunately, this problem has not heavily impacted the quality of my studies, as I have still managed to be a good student and have been able to still work quite a bit. I do get nervous about the surgery, but I take comfort in knowing that my family and significant other will be there for me during recovery. Fortunately, because of my younger age and relatively good flexibility, I hope that my recovery will be smooth.
As mentioned before, I would love to hear from a younger person who has experienced THP but also any person who could give me some support, encouragement and general tips would be very appreciated.

"Hi friends
Well l start this with my heading. Will it ever be the same it was. I am starting to think not.
A lot of time has passed since my both my hip replacements 6 months from 1st 4 months from 2nd. Mentally l feel exausted with all the things that are going on in my life and there does not seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel for me.
Let me tell you my life in past 6 years.
Me and my husband were trying for a family at that time l was 36 nothing was happening naturally and we had to go down the route of IVF where l found out it was me that was not producing eggs normally. So l went through 1 round of IVF which was unsucessful. By this time l was classed as to old to get it on the NHS although l had started trying before the cut of age of 36 the waiting list was to long to l ended up missing cut of point and had to pay for it out of our savings. I was so desperate for a family we tried again and its hard going on your body you have to wait 6 months inbetween trying to let your body recover. 2nd time around no luck again. Again l was still yearning for my own family it was torture. We had one last try after eating through most of our saved money this time sucess l had just turned 40 and l said at the start if l had not fell pregnant by the time l turned 40 l was giving up. But to our amazment l was pregnant.....l never thought l would say those words l am pregnant. It was short lived as l miscarried at 7 weeks. My world fell apart. I had to grieve and accept the fact that this was my life luckily l have a great husband who helped me through this awful time it took me a year nearly 2 to get over it. It was a living hell.
I turned 42 and started getting a pain in my groin like l had pulled a mucsle at 1st it was bearable but always there l went to doctors who agreed it would be muscle related months past of me going to work with this pain and it steadily got worse l again returned to my doctors who sent me for xrays this time. That was november last year. A week later l was told l needed both hips replaced. BOTH . I was in shock l could not unerstand why l was not unhealthy or carrying extra weight l was normal. But the one lucky thing l did have was bupa through my work as a benifit ( private medical insurance) to you all not from.britain. i was seen a week or 2 later by surgeon who told me l had the nastiest looking hips he had seen and did not understand how l was still walking.
1st hip replaced 9th dec
2nd hip replaced 15th feb.
Have been in recovery ever since sometimes going well sometimes having a hard time. But l would say for both hips it was a pretty smooth recovery it might be taking longer than l though but l was walking everyday my PT was so happy with my progress they told me l did not need to be seen again. But like a lot of you l had up and down week some weeks feeling so low l would cry all the time some weeks feeling better and its been ongoing since then.
But and here is the but l have still been getting pains in my knee's when l was wallking and as times went by its been getting worse. I get really bad back pain as well. So off l go back to doctors who this time was the most horrible gp l have seen no empathy never even lifted his head to me in the room just stared at the computer and asked me why l needed my hips replaced so young!!!! I was shocked at him saying that as after being on this forum for so long l know l am not so young there are much younger people than me thats had thr's and was l meant to know the answer to that anyway!! I am not the doctor.
I asked him if l could have my hips and knee's xrayed as something was not right my recovery was dragging on l should be back at work by now but l am still waking in pain l still need painkillers.
1 week later l am called back to doctors Dr Horrible to be told my knee's are just as bad as my hips were. Severe scaring and OA in both.
So now folks before you all fall asleep reading my story even if you have given up half way through l am back to the hospital on wednesday to see knee surgoen. The same man that done my hips he will be sick of looking at me by now.
And in the midst of all that l have been attending hospital with my mum last week who has just found out she has cancer in her lung.
Why is life so hard. I am trying my best to stay posative for my mum l have to go to hospital today with her to see what her treatment is but it been a terrible 6 years for me. I am now 43 and l know l seem like a hard luck story. I am not looking for sympathy l just needed to get it all out my system by writing it down. I know there are people a lot worse off than me and l will get through this like l have got through everything else. I don't care about me at the moment l care more about whats happeening to my mum.
I am sorry for posting such a long story but l do ask myself will my life ever be the same? I don't think it will as l am a diffremt person now. I am sorry if it seems so doom and gloom l have got good parts in my life. A great husband and mum and dad and this forum has been invaluble to me.
I don't post threads a lot l tend to just try and offer advice or join in with other folks. But l am just sitting ar 5.15am in the morning thinking of my life and how it will end up.
Please don't let this put the newbies off hip replacements as they are a good thing. Its everything else thats going on in my life. Is it knee surgery ahead now. If so bring it on as l think l have hardened to things now as l am stronger than l was.
Again l apoligise for the life story but its helped me by just writing it.
Love you all
Laura

"Hello,
I had a simple op at 8 yrs. Pins and a plate followed by a body cast. At 16
I had an op that was two parts. A bone graft was used to add surface area
(Support)to the socket. That didn't take so we tried again my senior year of
high school. Yup! Cap n' gown over body cast and crutches. Sweet! The 2nd
part of the op didn't seem to work either. My femur was sawn opposite the
femoral head. The piece was reattached to the femur slightly lower down.
The goal was to lengthen the muscle, tendons, ligaments that connect to
the pelvis. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I was told the procedure was
a success about 70% of the patients. My leg just got shorter. I'm not bitter.
I'm 50 years old. I was very active my whole life. The pain? Oh well. Today I
contacted my doctor. I hope to start pre-op soon. This forum is great! Thank

I am not using a stick in the house at all, I can bend my knees when I am in my sloth like position on the settee ( although not all the time ) I tidied up some clutter ( I think I could be a hoarder if I tried a little bit harder!)  I did some work on my computer for school, I had long periods of hippie fix on this forum, ( do you think we will all have to join a forum for obsessive use of forums soon)  and then I took my 2 hooligan border terriers for a walk - all by myself, FREEDOM!!!! Well what a juggling act that was - one lead with a splitter thing, 2 hooligans, a small birthday present for a friend, a birthday card, 2 bags of poo , a walking stick and too many layers when the sun shone!!!! Oh my word , the added complication of having to stop as my husband kept texting me to check I was ok out in the big wide world, at which point I had to juggle all the stuff to find my phone.  
So all in all, walking was easy peasy, but juggling at the same time was tricky. Oh the relief of dropping off the present and finding a bin for the poo and taking my coat off. Small pleasures. !!!!
todays challenge is to get a urine sample from my dog and take it to the vets. My old Labrador has arthritis and the vet won't give me any more of his anti inflammatory unless I take a urine sample in. I just can't wait for this next level of juggling to take place - so will rest on the settee until I feel energetic enough !!!
have a good day all of you. 
Love Malloo
ps I was reading in another discussion about shoes. I have got some Sketchers, I think they have memory foam inside and have loads of sort of bubbly support underneath, they are SO comfortable and supportive when walking x

"My surgeon is extremely pleased with my progress. Her physiotherapist is impressed with my leg strength. I can ditch my crutches and all of my restrictions have been lifted. I go back this afternoon for a one hour exercise class. She's put me in an advanced category for physiotherapy.
My legs are apparently the same length (she measured them). The perceived discrepancy is due to the increased space in the joint after surgery. My hips need to catch up. I am to walk without any lifts in my shoes for another four months and we will follow up in October.

"Hello my friends, hope you are all well. I'm feeling so low at the moment, and it seems like I'm not moving forward at all. Does anyone else's hip bow out on the operated side. I'm tired all the time and weepy. I still can't walk without my one crutch, waddling is very bad, feels like the hip might pop out of the side if I put too much weight on it. I guess I'm feeling sorry for myself at the moment, didn't help having infection in my nerves in my gums.  I think I'm in need of a pep talk. Sorry to be so negative my friends, but I'm just so fed up of being so tired. Did anyone else feel like this at 4 weeks. Sending you all love and hugs. Warmest wishes. Julia. Xx

"Hello, all.
I'm new here to this forum and would very much appreciate some advice from anybody who has experienced the same thing?
I'm a 53 year old female, and had a new hip in mid-April (due to dysplasia, probably congenital). I had been in great pain beforehand, and was really excited (sounds funny, but I was!) to have the operation as I was naively thinking I would be bouncing around again in no time. The operation went well, so my surgeon tells me (titanium and ceramic prothesis, frontal incision). I was lucky enough to be able to attend a three-week physiotherapy cure a month after the surgery, where I partipated every day in a number of targeted exercises (underwater exercises, individual physiotherapy etc). I met my goal and was able to walk without any support (crutches or stick) during my time there. Now I'm back at home, and finding that if I don't take a pain killer every day, I'm back to limping / waddling (you know the routine!). I'm so disappointed, as I thought that the surgery would take care of this. I know I'm being hopelessly naive and impatient, but - based on similar experience - can anyone give me an idea of how long it will take before I'm walking normally again? How long will I need to take pain killers? (Stupid question, I know - even my doctor can't give me an answer on that one).
Also: the doctor at the rehab facility told me that I must continue physiotherapy (but it's been hard to get an appointment). Yesterday my surgeon said, ""no! you don't need it.  Don't overdo it.""  Who's right?  (I've joined a gym and do all weight-lifting machines that _don't_ involve undue pressure on hip, stress, or torsion; I also ride a stationary bike, which I've been told is one of the best things to do). I've seen on this site that some people do glute exercises - can anyone tell me more? I know that's where I need to rebuild muscle.
Again, many thanks for any and all insights that you might be able to give me.

"Hi All
I was advised I required a THR 18 months ago, I'm only 43 so I was a little surprisd when I was told this. It has always been my knee that caused me pain for years. After MRI on knee confirmed it wasn't the issue. It was actually my hip - confirmed via x-rays. I've booked surgery as going private because I would have to wait forever here in NZ going public. My first consultation is tomorrow with my surgeon. What questions should I ask to ensure I am well prepared for surgery?

"I am a 42 year old male who had perthes as a child. I have had some pain my entire life and the occasional flare ups but nothing too bad until 2 years ago. I have had a rapid deteriation since then and have for the first time in my life felt crippled for the last 6 months.
As I see it I have 2 sets of problems.
1. Osteo Arthritus of the hip joint. XRAYs and MRI show that I still have some good cartilage but that it is worn away to bone on bone in some areas. I have bone cysts and spurs on and under my femoral head. My hip joint cluncks and scrapes with every step. It sounds like a small bag of gravel. Walking more than a hundred metres is excrutiating. I have a pronounced limp.
2. Deformity of the femoral head. My femoral head looks like a squashed portobello mushroom. It is pockmarked and chipped and has bumps. It basically just doesn't work properly. My hip sticks out and my knee points in. I have an unusual gait that is wearing away my ankle tendons and the discs in my lower back. My left leg is 2.5cm shorter than my right leg. I have a shoe lift but it doesn't help with the function of the hip.
I have seen a surgeon a few times over the years and finally they have recommended THR. I am dissapointed that they are only able to use the posterior approach due to my deformity. I guess I am seeking to things on this forum.
1. Confirmation that my decision is justified. I am pretty sure it is.
2. First hand information on posterior total hip replacement in younger patients from someone who has been through it first hand.
I have included a couple of MRI images of my diseased joint.

"Hi new and older hippies (?!)
i am passing on cumulative advice given to me by three different private specialists.
benefit....to strengthen hip muscles pre op, to maintain control if you slip or twist post op, to keep joint more secure for life.
To find your butt muscles -
lie on back with knees bent
squeeze butt cheeks to raise butt off floor a little
using hands, feel if thighs are engaged
if the thighs are engaged, you have not located just your butt muscles as they should work in isolation from the leg muscles.
try the action whilst feeling with your hands, as to which muscles are tightening
the ideal is to be able to lift very slightly off the floor, with relaxed thigh muscles.
another way to feel the correct muscles, is to lie in same position, lift one leg and hook inner hand behind knee from inner thigh area, and gently push leg against hand. Use the other hand on the outside of the buttock to feel whether the butt muscles are 'found' yet.
i practiced this for weeks before I could separate the butt from the thigh properly, and now use this exercise all the time,even when walking to keep them working.
I am convinced that my speedy recovery has been helped by preparing muscles for surgery.
if you are waiting for a date for surgery search Google for pre op exercises and start NOW
Happy butts!

I'm fine when I'm on my feet, the problem occurs when I wake up - there is no time lag between feeling the need to go and going - which is obviously leading to accidents and is really something I could do without.
I suppose it could still be the aftermath of the spinal block, or that I'm sleeping so deeply that I'm not waking up with sufficient time, I just don't know.

"Hi all, thank you for all the very sensible and useful advice and thank you Graham for your website. When I am unsure about anything I refer to it!  
Feel ready now. Finished work on Thursday. Doing last minute gardening and cleaning. After tomorrow my ""boys"" will just have to cope. Which I have no doubt they will. Looking forward to some lovely food. Yes they can cook!  
Looking forward to watching Glastonbury on the TV lying on my raised sofa in the dry with a clean available toilet (with raise!) and chilled white wine. We were going to go!  Youngest son is going straight after A Levels. Hope he and his mates have an amazing time. 
I am so grateful to our NHS. I am having an expensive operation at a hospital and a surgeon of my choice. Was only told I needed a Hip Replacement 3 months ago.  The pain has really ramped up the last two weeks, so I am at the point where I actually can't wait!
without the option of this marvellous operation my future would look very bleak. Sick and tired of feeling sick and tired!
Have bought myself an expensive sun bed (Jamie Oliver) and raises for it so if it is nice weather I can also sit in the garden. 
Filled my pots with lots of geraniums bizzy lizzies and petunias. So all the boys have to do it water them. Downloaded books on to my kindle. Fitted raised toilet seats to an upstairs and downstairs toilet. 
Have cushion to take with me. Thanks CelsB. 
Oh and bought a ""decent"" nightie!
 Think I am prepared. 
Only thing I am worried about is the Spinal. Having actually watched a Hip Replacement when I was first qualified I know how brutal it is. That was nearly 30 years ago. BUT. Really don't want to hear see smell feel a thing. 
I will talk to the anaesthetist tomorrow   In my head I have to think that I go to sleep and they sprinkle fairy dust over me and that is it! Voila new hip!
Will let you all know how I get on.

"Hello all
A couple of weeks ago I got some good advice on here about using a static bike and I just thought I would update you as to my progress. I first tried it at mid week 5, just a few rotations but it hurt and so I stopped. However, at the end of week 6 I tried again and found it to be much more comfortable. I started with sessions of about 3 minutes on low resistance, but have quickly worked up to 3 sessions of 10 minutes per day on mid resistance and I really feel it is strengthening my leg. I do find it incredibly boring unless I can prop my book up to read as I go! So my experience has definitely been a positive one and I shall continue with this for some time.
Good healing to you all.

My hubby took me on a 2 minute car journey today to visit my sister (groundhog day was beginning to grate)! I got in & out the car OK (seat right back & back rest reclined) but during the journey, I started to panic that I would get cramp in my hamstring & wouldn't be able to stretch (instinct tells you to reach for your toes but I know I can't do that). I don't know if it was because the seat depth finishes half way across the back of my hamstring but I was tensing every time we turned a corner, it was horrible. I've got a 30 minute trip to the hospital tomorrow to have my clips out & I'm wondering if I'll be better lying on the back seat. Has this happened to anyone else?

"Hello All - 
Sending huge hugs to all of our friends all over the world waiting or recovering from a THP - Please can I ask your advice...
My recovery is great, my life is back to where it was before my hip pain started years ago, I am almost one hundred per cent (just waiting to ride a horse now!!) I am so happy and delighted with my new hip. Grateful... times it by a million and this is how I feel....but every now and then I am still feeling incredibly upset and sad...why? Is it just coming to terms with the operation? Does anyone else still have days like this months later? 
Today I heard the same ring of a telephone as the hospital ward, I was lying down at the time - completely unrelated to anything medical, just a beauty treatment and I felt overwhelmed with emotio hearing this ring. My reaction was quite terrifying. I could not breathe. I had something akin to I guess a panic attack. Just out of the blue. It was the simple combination of me lying down, hearing that same ring and the bright lights coming through my eyelids that shook me to the core. It took me back to the ward and that period of time in a heartbeat.  I nearly had to go home there and then, and have since fought my tears back all day.
I know my experience was not run of the mill, and I did have a very bad and unusual and serious situation in hospital - can anyone suggest ways to feel better? Does it just stop? Is this all normal? If anyone else has any thoughts on this, I would love to hear them. It is certainly not the end of the world feeling this way from time to time, but it is worrying me. Thank you all lovely hippies x

"How long did people have to wait for their hip replacements? This is a potted version of where I am at the moment, I hope I am not too boring. 
- Two years ago I was in the supermarket and felt faint, the next thing I knew I was flat on the floor surrounded by staff. I then discovered I could not stand by myself, but two burly shop assistants pulled me up and dumped me in a wheelchair. Came home and had terrible pain in top of right thigh.
- Went to an osteopath with GP approval, who worked on my right thigh. She said I might have a vascular problem as I had a heavy leg and it was painful to lift it up, so went to vascular surgeon with GP approval.
- A year ago Vascular surgeon said I had phlebitis in my right thigh and if I did not do something it would get much worse, so I had the main vein in my right leg removed and some little ones. Paid privately for VNUS Closure procedure and sclerotherapy, rather than vein stripping. It did not make a blind bit of difference to the heavy leg and pain, if anything it was worse. 
- Went to physio to try and relief the pain. She said it could be a nicked femoral artery and bursitis.
- Went to GP who referred me to another GP who can do steroid injections. He said it was not bursitis but could be a torn muscle. Suggested I had blood tests.
- GP said there was nothing he could do, but gave me paracetamol. I asked if I could have a scan, he said it would not help. I then said could I see a consultant privately. He gave me a phone number and said phone him.
- Made an appointment with consultant, GP gave consultant a letter saying I was fully mobile, and weight bearing. Minor muscle pain and it was my request to see the consultant! In fact the letter was rubbish. By this time I was in agony and pretty well housebound. 
- This week I saw the consultant, lay on the bed and in five seconds he sad ""It's your hip"". This was the first time anyone had mentioned the word HIP. 
- Had an x-ray, went back to consultant who said you need a hip replacement NOW or you will be in a wheelchair by Christmas as the whole hip joint is clobbered, he actually used medical terms to say that! I was gobsmacked. 
- I have discovered going privately is very pricey. How long will I have to wait for an operation on the NHS? The consultant is supposed to be writing to my GP. I am not sure what I should say to my GP apart I am not a happy bunny!

Me? Well I finally feel like I'm beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. And it feels great to say that.

I am able to walk about a mile or mile and a half in a straight walk if that makes sense, and just the other day was out shopping with a friend and walked 2 1/2 miles. Wow!! Was super happy with that.
Hip is definitely feeling stronger every day i think. I'm still having bother with my knees and quad on my left side where i had op. When I'm walking for a bit, my thigh gets really tight and stiff and heavy and then it's just a mission to get home.

"Hi Hippies, Thank you Malloo for your comments. Think I'm one of those you were talking about. I've only said a fraction of the horrors that have actually happened. Last week was really bad, got very low and the pain was off the charts even with uppng the morphine. Was feeling sorry for myself, but gave myself a kick up the bum when I read of the youngsters, the ones with small children and those on their own having to cope with everything. The hardest thing is not being able to walk with my 3 little grandsons or have them on my lap. Also not working is really eating at me. However I'm so lucky to have my wonderful hubby hero.Henry. He has simply been amazing. Feeling more upbeat this week. We have booked some things in the diary to look forward to, Even managed to get to the RA summer exhibition yesterday. Parked right outside and did it in stages, lot of sitting around, But Hey, last week didn't even think I would make it. We've booked a holiday for next week too. Think Grahams idea of writing down small improvements helps you remember where you  are now even if they are slow coming. So thanks Rocketman!
Saw my physio who talked about working on my scoliosis, sciatic pain and other issues too. It's great to find someone who looks at you as a whole person, not juat a hip! 
Those with Knee pain , she suggested putting a cushion roll under the knee, gently rotate the leg outward and raise and lower, I've only done them a couple of days and see an improvment already compared to the straight leg raise and lower exercise. 
Big thank yous and hugs to everyone, will come back when I need another kick up bum!!!!! Be kind to yourselves. Lots of love X

I went out last night with my mum and sister anheard them telling a group of people that I can walk okay but i have became dependent on the crutch but the reason for not walking without it is all in my mind i found this really hurtful.
i had a lateral approach and without the crutch i can tell that there is not enough muscle there.
I am doing the exercises as per the pt and also started with my stationary bike.

"Has anyone experienced upper leg swelling (knee upwards).  I am 2 weeks post op and did not have much swelling until a few days ago.  I have just started practising around the flat with one crutch and wonder if I am 'behind' others or should i be still on 2 until I have clips removed on Tuesday.  I am thrilled to learn from reading your messages that some are already sleeping on their 'good' side within a couple of weeks as it is the single most trouble (apart from the swelling) sleeping on your back.  Does anyone have any tips please about any of the above?  Thank you so much. VivB

"Hi all, 
I had my 6 week consultation and it went great.  Had another set of x-rays taken (I think I've definately had my quota for the next decade now!!) and it all looks fine.  The consultant has lifted all restrictions on me and has pretty much set me loose. The only permanent restriction he has given me is deep inflextion towards the opposite shoulder (i think thats the correct term) as he says that would almost definately dislocate it. Well I couldnt do that motion before surgery, so I dont think I will miss it! I'm allowed to drive and to start getting back to the gym. I got a copy of my x-ray.  It was so strange to see the implant in place!  I was also quite struck by how small the ball of the implant is compared to my natural hip joint! Its amazing that it actually stays in there. 
With regards to work he was quite keen to get me back next week, as such he's given me a sick note suggesting phased return - 50% for up to 4 weeks. He also wants me to phase out the crutch, so I have started practising today and so far so good....
You might be able to tell I am in a more positive mood than I was in my last post. Hopefully that will last.  I think the secret (as others said) is not to overdo it, otherwise it opens up a whole lot of pain.

So thats it for now I guess.  Follow up appointment booked for 6 months from now.

"Hello fello hippies
Well l am at the monent still recovering from 2 hip replacements 1st done in december and 2nd done on 15th february. I admit its not been easy at all a lot of good has came out it in the fact have had no OA pain that l suffered for almost a year. Had 1st thr and my recovery seemed to be flawless l was walking without aid as soon as l got home and doing my PT everyday and was desperate to get 2nd done 4 weeks after 1st but had to wait 8 weeks. This one was totally diffrent. My recovery was much harder, possibly because l was still healing from the 1st. I am 14 weeks post 2nd op and was still suffereing a lot of pain and discomfort. I tried to walk everyday to help my hips but found that my knee's were in pain afterwords. And l was also getting backpain. And sitting in a chair for more than an hour was really painful hence l am still off work. I returned to the doctor who sent me for xrays in my hips and knee's and l have been called back this morning as there is now OA in my knee's. Not sure the extent of it or if l need anything done. But l will soon find out as l am going just now. It just seems to be never ending and a rollercoaster of emotion.
Well here goes l hope its not to bad.

Anyway, I was making good progress but now 5 1/2 months in I am having a setback where I am limping again and my right knee is hurting. I was trying to go back to modified yoga and such but think going back to basic PT exercises and taking it easier might be the thing to do. Any one else still limping around almost 6 months later?

"Hi.
Doing really well. Now 8 wks post op.
Saw surgeon this wk. Said just to continue one crutch outdoors. Lift restrictions but be careful and start driving tho not to be in/out car too much at first and to get in bum first and swivel in legs not twisting.
Well ok but i forgot completely as went about a bit more normally and without thinking squatted down to a low cupboard. Boyo!!! My knee on op leg felt so full and tight thought it was gonna pop!
Then yesterday went out for short drive to reaqauaint myself with car. Got few plants. Put them in baskets. Swept up.
Im so tired and achy today but that knee on op leg is real tight.
Could it be from residual swelling from my hip surgery?
The leg still is larger especially at end of day.
I did get lot of knee pain in first two weeks as thought it had been twisted in manipulating hip joint.
Dont see surgeon again till Oct and hoping for phased return to work after 8th july.

"Ok!! Just passed my 10 weeks post-op from my RTHR and have been back to work 2 weeks now...my new hip is wonderful!! I love it!! No pain!! No limp...sorta!!
My old hip hurts like crazy...I'm at a job where I'm on my feet all day!! And 1/2 way through my shift...I'm wanting to pull my hair out cause my old hip hurts!! At first my old hip and both my feet were sore...and I'm like, ok...have to get my poor feet in shape for standing all day again...by the end of the second week...my old (left) hip and right foot still kill me...
I'm thinking...my left hip is killing me and I'm putting all my weight on the new hip now...which is why my right foot is still killing me and can't get used to the standing??
I'm worried that with me putting all my weight on the new hip it will mess it up...?

"Hi all,
I now have a date for my THR 20th June.
we have a family holiday booked for the end of August which will be 8 weeks after. This means a 4 hour flight and obviously I won't have any control over height of seats, beds, toilets and sun beds!  
The Pysios at the hospital reccomend folding hip precautions for 3 months, which seems a lot to me. I am 51 and am in relatively good shape. 
Wondering if I should cancel holiday or should I be good to go?
Has anyone travelled by plane 8 weeks post THR?  How did you get on?
will have husband and grown up boys with me so shouldn't have to lift a finger - hopefully?!
will be having uncemented hip with standard UK anterior approach. 
I have been to the joint school at the hospital but did not have a date for surgery at that time. 
Wil try and contact the hospital as well as need to make a decision in the next few days.
Getting scared now!
Thank you all for any advice

"I'm 16 weeks now and I can't believe how great I feel.
  I tried to put off having the op but the pain and mobility was really difficult.  I was worried about my job because I'm on my feet all the time and it's a physical job.But  I can do it, getting better at getting up from kneeling, I can carry something that's heavy (not massive heavy) to the end of the aisle, I couldn't do it before my op. I can work my 7 hour shift no problem and could work longer, also go for a 5-6mile walk after it.
I got another milestone today, I walked upstairs properly, don't know if I can do it tomorrow but I know I did it, and the steep hils are getting easier too.
Click here to view image
But what I'm trying to say is the first weeks are awful, but when things start moving forward it's such a good feeling, and you will get there. It does not matter if you can get yourself into bed straight away or two weeks later like me, or if your off your pain meds, walking aids early or late, most of us get through it, though some have extra problems and theirs will take a bit longer.
If your thinking of getting it done, do it,to be out of painand have more mobility is fantastic.
Keep going everyone and take care.xx

"Well I can say I managed pretty well. Today was my first time driving since my surgery (will be 4 weeks post op on Tuesday). I think I did pretty well. I was worried about being able to put on the brakes, gas when I needed to because my right leg was the operated side, but I managed it just fine. I went to Walmart all by myself. I used my crutches to get into the store and once inside got a ride on buggy. Once I finished I had to leave the buggy inside and put my things in a regular cart and pushed it out to the parking lot just fine. In fact I noticed that I walk better pushing the cart than before my surgery. With two bad hips and a messed up spine I had to lean on the carts with all my weight and still could barely walk. Today was different, and I actually was standing up straight pushing the cart and did it all with minimal pain....Quite a bit of difference. Perhaps when I get my left hip done I will be able to walk somewhat normal again. Yep, today was definitely a milestone for me....Thanks to all of you for your advice and support...Barb

Can any of you let me know if you had any new or recurrent aches and pains when you lifted the restrictions?
I am 9wk post op today and was told last week by OS could drop restrictions, drive ,sleep on sides and stop using crutches in home, gradually stop use of one crutch outdoors.
Did do yoo much on first day admittedly but more cautious since.
Noticed that the chair feels so low now. My back and thighs ache when I get up.
My back now is sore and shoulders too???? (I do have ""crap spine"" according to OS as I have arthritis throughout all lumbar spine with DDD. I have had spinal injections for pain but sort of ignored this due to getting hip sorted.
Sleep is better but not onto op side fully.

"Hi everyone, I was looking back through some old posts trying to find one about constipation if all subjects (!) & I found Kate's post about sleeping. I'm sure she won't mind as I've took the liberty of copying it again. It was such a great read & made perfect sense particularly now I'm post -op.
As I now consider myself a hip guru after two THR's wink I thought I would impart my most considerable knowledge about sleeping post op.
So as you gather in closer to the screen to read I am going to poke you in the eye and tell you the first first rule...
1) There are no rules of sleep club
In fact there are so many rules of sleep club world wide that it would be hard to confine them all but we are all victim to our country, our county and surgeons particular cruelty (I mean surgical style) when it come to how we are supposed to sleep. Anterior, posterior and lateral scars all bring their own particular delights when trying to stop doing the twist in the early hours.
So, you can arm yourself with the latest in latex support pillows, V pillows, small hand embroidered cushions that Aunty Edna gave you, mattress toppers, wedges, sleeping tablets, pain relief, whiskey cocktail or a complete hospital bed but one thing isn't going to change - your healing!
Our lives before were clock driven , getting a good night's sleep before getting up for work was imperative. Lack of sleep meant we couldn't function properly.
Now, the God of New and Shiny Hip Implants has thrown all that up in the air and we don't know where we are!
We toss and turn (very carefully) waiting for the elusive sleep that never comes or comes in annoying one hour servings. You think you have slept all night only to find that barely ten minutes has gone by since you last looked at the clock. You hobble out of bed with one eye shut, trying to fool yourself into staying asleep while you have a midnight wee and you just know that if you lie there a bit longer then YOU MUST fall asleep.
As we all know things at night are magnified to horror proportions and the sweating, the pain, the twitching, the discomfort have all become mountains we cannot climb.
So, you have read this far and you are waiting for me to give you the secret to sleeping all through the night after having part of your leg chopped off and in a position that you detest. Sorry, I don't have have those answers but what I have learned is....
This lack of sleep, is it so bad? Are you hoping to go to work in the morning? Are you leaping out of bed to go hiking, on holiday, ice sking? No.
The best cure I can find for lack of sleep is - chill out, go with it, let it happen.
Goodness knows what healing is going on inside but it doesn't confine itself to happening at night. It is imperative to rest in the first 6 weeks as it is to walk and that rest can be feet up on the sofa or a few catnaps throughout the day.
I have no problems with lack of sleep because I don't care about it.
A six weeks (today) after my 2nd THR I have learned that it is all transient. Regular sleep comes back in a position that we favour eventually and the trick is to stop worrying about it.
I sleep most of the night now, waking up between 5.30 and 6.30am. Once you find that it okay to find a sleeping place all over the house you will sleep much better as well.I was more comfortable on the sofa this time so that's where I went.
I watched all the films that no one else wanted to watch and knew that I was getting back to normal when it took me five nights to watch a film.
So, wave yourself a magic wand, stop fretting, this is temporary and I'll even go as far as to say enjoy it. For those going back to work that will come soon enough and your body regulates very quickly so in the meantime give yourself a night break, chill out - a bowl of ice cream at 3am is really rather nice!

"Hi all!  So I was 5 weeks post op yesterday and up until week 3 or 4 I thought I was making really good progress. Things seem to have stalled a little bit for me.  I'm walking pretty well on one crutch now, but I get quite a lot of pain / discomfort around the area of surgery.  It also still feels like I have a ball of swelling in the area.  Is this normal for 5 weeks or should I be worried I might have an infection or something?  I see the consultant for my 6 week check up on Monday so I guess I'll ask him then. 
Incidently he had told me by 6 weeks I wouldnt need my crutches anymore.  I dont think I'm going to achieve that which is frustrating as I hoped to spend 2 weeks building up strength to go back to work at 8 weeks.

I removed my dressing a few days ago, the wound is absolutely amazing, hardly visible , but even now I still have red marks all the way round where the sticky stuff off the dressing seemed to irritate my skin. I have put moisturiser on, but it's still a bit red and sometimes itchy. I tried antihistamine but I think that's what sent me to sleep! Any ideas? 
P.s 16 days post op I am walking round the house with no sticks. I ventured up to the supermarket on Thursday with 2 sticks (1.2miles) and although I was tired I felt pretty steady - although very slow. I am still wary of doing much more yet. I feel safe at home - the big wide world is suddenly full of obstacles !!!!

I have to use my crutch in right hand but that wont be possible as its right shoulder being done. Im really worried as it will effect my mobility. Going out and using toilet and many other things.
I think this is going to set ne back even more and iv got my first physio class tomorrow but clearly i wont be having many of those either.

"What does that have to do with hip replacement? Supposedly Prince had the surgery but it didn't totally relieve the pain.
Fentanyl is one of the 3 narcotics administered to my son as general anesthesia. The others were Dilaudid & Protocol. Note that last one was used by Michael Jackson.
What am I trying to say?
I wish I could have influenced my son to have spinal rather than general. I feel he would have had mental clarity sooner rather than just starting to gain some now. I asked both a nurse friend & a doctor if the affects of GA can last months. (Thank you Bini, too.)
YES, they can. Especially if your kidneys have been compromised. (Yes.)
My son will need RTHR, & I'll return to the MidWest from Hawaii in less than 2 weeks.
These powerful narcotics do NOT have the same effects on everyone. We waited over 4 hours for son to recover enough to be transported. We are still waiting for cognitive clarity to move forward.
Mahalo for reading. Please share if you are still recovering from the fog of general anesthesia for your THR.

I, like others, had read alot of the bad experiences and put it off twice until I couldn't walk without a cane, couldn't get up out of a chair without turning sideways and pushing up off the chair arm. I was eating opoids like m and m's so I could go to work(construction) every day to save money for a possible 12 weeks off. It was BAD. My wife cried alot watching me grit my teeth every step and going to work. I had done alot of research, talked to several people who had it done. They had zero complications and were very encouraging and advised me to stay off any forums as most posts were negative experiences. So I opted on the anterior approach, and went thru with it May 11 2016. They did the spinal block and said I would just be sleepy and ""May hear us talking, but would not feel a thing."" They were right! After entering the OR loopy from the pre meds to relax me, the last things I remember were them asking me to sit up, 'lean forward and arch your back like a Halloween cat"" the spinal was inserted, pain free and I laid back down. Their last words ..""roll over on your left side"" next thing I was opening my eyes in recovery. They gave me some ice to chew on, a pain shot, observation for 60 mins then up to my room. 2 hrs later I used a walker to use the restroom. 4 hrs later PT came in, got me up, used the walker, 2-300 steps. Mind you the spinal was still working full time. Anyway,, I was amazed! The surgeon came in to see me @7.30 am the next morning. I demonstrated I could walk with zero aid. He said after PT that morning, I could go home that afternoon if I wanted. I wanted! PT the next day, PT the next Mon, Wed and Friday. I had the exercises down pat. Never went back. I was sore(muscular) but never had joint pain. I went back to work on day 9 being careful not to do some specific movements to stay out of danger of dislocation. I have been working ever since and back in the gym 3-4 days a week. Today was week 4, zero issues. I am walking pain and limp free! I'm off(been off) the pain meds, and today were my last morning and afternoon 325mg aspirin for clot protection. Driving and working every day, pain free. I am astounded! I feel for those with post op issues, and I see there are many. I wanted to post my positive experience in hopes of encouraging others that it's not all bad. Albeit its only been 4 weeks, but I am very very happy to have my life back! Peace, love and prayers for all!

Last year I had my RTHR and it was fine, but then weeks later I fractured my greater trochanter and still have to use a crutch as it's inoperable.
Now I have to have my left knee replaced and I was wondering if anyone knows of a similar helpful site to this one.

Has anyone experienced this for such a long time period.
All cultures come back negative
No pain involved
it either drains continually or then closes up and appears like a golf ball until it breaks and has discharge.
We have now gone to another surgeon but he cannot recommend anything other than another hip replacement surgery
there have been debridments, aspirations, bone scan indiums, mris  cat scans all negative.

"Hi everyone just wanted to share my Graduation. Phew it's been a long time coming with restrictions in place for the full 12 weeks. I have now had a bath 1st time since operation on 12th March, was a little scared at 1st but just went for it. I managed to get out ok I don't think we realise how strong our upper body becomes following this op.
I've been back at work since week 7 , driving since week 6 and everything has been ok. I'm pleased to say that I am now pain free and walking without a limp so it has all been worth the discomfort of the 1st few weeks.
The only problem I seem to have is that I can't bend down to my foot on my operated leg. I have been restricted from doing this so this may be why but I find dressing difficult and still use my grabber. I cannot cut my toe nails either or fasten shoes. Is this normal and does any of you lovely hippies know how long this takes to overcome or if I should be doing any exercise to help. I'im still scared of dislocation and wonder if this fear ever goes away.
Thanks

"Hi
Two weeks on from my THR, I am currently on paracetamol for pain (nothing else). I am worried that continued use of paracetamol could cause urinary retention leading to use of a catheter which I'd want to avoid at all cost. So I was thinking of either stopping paracetamols completely or cut them right down, say to 2 x 500 mg every night.
Am I worrying unnecessarily? Should I continue with the dosage recommended by the hospital which helps with the bruising of the leg? Thx Jeremy

"hello everyone,
as as a fairly new hippy (3weeks) i am gleaning much from you all on my own personal road of recovery, thank you for all your tips.
i have noticed two things that affect me now, one is that some days I feel I could climb a mountain but wash out in the afternoons.  When I stay safe at home all day, it helps me have a little more energy for the next day when I try and do something extra. I cannot walk on our pavements/sidewalks easily so have fallen into the trap on tidying and walking from room to room with things, or going out in a car for a coffee or lunch.
how do you all manage your progress I wonder?
secondly, I notice that my pulse rate increases rapidly when I rest, after what I would call a gentle stroll around the garden. 
Anyone else notice this too?

if any of you get too hot with all those pillows, toppers and warm ice packs, I use a dogs cool mat!
This is a bi fold gel mat, designed and sold for dogs to sit on  in Summer
it gets a bit cooler with light pressure. Lasts as long as it takes to get to sleep, and is so easy to slide under the back/hip area when you feel the wound warming up during the night. It reduces swelling too of course.
if you wake up hot again later, just swing it around for the other end to cool you down again.   It is totally reusable and cools down on its own.
ta da!
if you can't find one online, let me know and I will find out the name from the pet shop
hope this helps someone, somewhere

"Hi all you very special and lovely people.  I hope everyone is getting on well with their individual recoveries.  This site has helped me so much before my op and  afterwards.
I am 7 weeks post op revision left hip surgery today.  I had my post-op check up at hospital this morning and came out feeling quite positive.  I had a lot of questions and worries that were answered by a lovely consultant.  She was so down to earth and friendly.
My original left hip plant needed to be taken out urgently because of problems (metal on metal hip resurfacing) and will in the future need the right hip implant to be taken out, but hopefully not for some time. I just want to get through this recovery and try and relax a bit and start enjoying my life.  It's been far too long since I've done that.
Now I  look back over the past few weeks and see what a journey the early weeks are and I see real improvements.  It was great to finish the injections (horrible things but necesssary), trying to get comfy in bed, on chairs, etc, getting those stockings off finally, being able to get around on one crutch, albeit limping around.  Getting into a car and going round the shops for a bit was really good - felt a bit normal.  Lots of things really.  I don't get chance to get on the site much but always read every post and I think you are all amazing people.  It really does feel like you have a close knitwork of friends and it's good to share knowledge and experiences and medical staff can't always answer, as brilliant as they are at fixing us.
Anyway, I wish you all a wonderful weekend and will try and post again real soon.
Love and hugs to you all from Pammyw.

"I have decided to share my unfortunate experience.  On 4/23/16, I fell getting up out of a wobbly recliner in the late evening.  Fortunately, a friend wa there to help me get up.  I was also suffering from edema to both feet which prompted me to try to sleep in the recliner.  Though I was unable to`sleep, I waited the night through and took a cab to the emergency room.  During my emergency room evaluation, which i went there predominantly for the edema in myfeet, the ER Doc let me know that I had broken the ball off of my right femur in my fall the night before.  He called my orthopedic surgeon in to confer with me about moving up my hip replacement. The hip replacemet was attempted the following evning at th same hospital.  When I woke up in the Orhtopedic floor, I was told that the hip replacement didn't happen becuase when the surgeon lifted the broken femur head upt, he thought he saw pus.  Thus I was put on IV anitbiotics and am still on oral antibiotics awaiting an upcoming 2 week period of time to be antibiotic free after which my right femur fluid will be retesed for infection and ,if clear of infection, I can reschedule my right hip replacement. What worries me is the loss of lenght in my right leg nd the loss f muscl tome waiting to have the hip replacement.  My originally scheduled hip replacement was to have been last week.  My dilemna is not knowing how long I will have to wait to get th hip replacement.  A friend of my father's, another doctor, told me that what my surgeon may have seen could have been decomposed fat or bone marrow which occcurs when a bone is fractured.  So far, my bone has not tested positive for infection but I was immediately put on antibiotics.
I am curious if anyone else has had an eperience such as this.

"Hi, I am new to this forum, but I have been reading the various posts
for a few weeks and found them really encouraging especially if I am
having a frustrating day.
I had a THR on 23rd March, I had a slipped upper right epiphysis
when I was 11, this was pinned back into place, but my hip was
damaged and became very painful in the past 2 /3 years. So I now
have a super new hip and the horrible pain has gone, but recovery
is much slower than I thought, I walked for miles on my 2 sticks,
and did all the exercises, no physiotherapy on offer,
after trying to go to 1 stick at about 6 weeks I strained a muscle on
my good side which is still giving me a lot of pain. At my 8 week
check, they tried to get me to walk with no sticks but my new hip side
has lost a lot of muscle strength and I was told my pelvis was out
of line, I got more specific exercises which I have done, but it's still
very slow progress. I seem to have 1 good day when I am fine with
no sticks in the house and can do a short walk with 1 stick, then
the next day I am totally exhausted. Anyone else had a similar
issue,

As my left hip is still so bad, she said to try walking with 1 crutch but supporting my left hip not the operated 1. Have tried this a few times this week without success. Pain in both hips after 20 minute walk & feeling very depressed and vulnerable that i can't manage this.
Op went really well and mostly pain free which is amazing especially since i don't think i realised how much pain i was in until 1 hip no longer has arthiritic pain so all this has been very positive.
Am due to go back tto work in a week on phased return but feeling really anxious about it. I don't want to use both crutches but feel this is what i will have to do. (such a pain when trying to carry things around!)
Has anyone else had 1 hip done & waiting for the other to be done?
I don't have an appointment with my surgeon until 8 weeks post op. Want to know if once the magic 6 weeks is up i can have a bath/sleep on opposite side?
Before having issues with both of my hips we used to go dancing 3 times a week (latin & ballroom) would kike to know if others have been dancing after thr.
I know i am rambling hut i seem to have so many questions buzzing round my head & would appreciate feedback.

My other thought is considering im only 20 I do from time to time go clubbing although obviously havent for a long time due to the pain. But what would happen if i had a few to many and were to fall, am i going to become paranoid about having nights and become even more antisocial?

"Hi friends,
12 weeks post op yesterday and I'm walking well without aids, sleeping well and doing most things normally now, like shopping, housework etc.
Have just started bowling again - lawn bowls - and I'm taking it slowly but jeez, after a few ends I'm exhausted.   I managed 6 ends this afternoon but it whacked me out.  It's not exactly a high impact sport but it does take some stamina which I seem to lack.  I've been asked to make up a Ladies Triples team at the end of June which will be 18 or 21 ends.  So that's another month but not sure if I should commit to it or not.
I know some of you are back at work now and am wondering if you've all got your mojo back or are still finding things tiring.
When did you get your stamina back?

"Hi all, just been discharged 2 days ago after right full hip replacement.  Stumbled upon this site and so glad I did.  Hopefully will keep my momentum up over the next few weeks.  I have suffered from ostioarthiritis for a number of years in both hips.  Will be getting left side done in January 2017.  I am in soo much pain at the moment and can't seem to get the hang of the crutches.  My knee has swelled up and is causing more pain.  Hospital has advised more rest but i'm going stir crazy lying in bed all day, just getting up to go to the loo.  I know it's early days but feeling very frustated with myself.

"4 weeks post left thr. Plodding along and making improvements. My wound had initially healed really well but tonite my hubby notes what looks like a minute hole at the top end of my scar (lateral approach ) it's approx 2mm wide and not sure how deep - looks superficial. There was a small amount of pus at the edge of the hole -
My Hubby cleaned it all and removed some of the pus. There isn't any erythema and it's not hot to touch or particularly painful - the only time it gets red and hot is on a nite for some reason and has done since surgery but settles in the morning.
I've put a dressing over it and will see how it gets on - if it hasn't improved or got worse I guess I
Will have to go to A&e ( lucky for me
I work there) and get the Ortho to check. Even tho I've got a
Lot of medical knowledge I'm a useless patient and it's different looking at it from a patient perspective. I'm petrified of the hole getting bigger or it getting severely infected

"I am a 52-year-old woman who has had OA since my late 20's.  At the time, I was told that nothing could be done until I was much older.  So I started the Nsaid game, did injections, lost weight, and now I'm to the point that I need more relief.  I went to see a new doctor and he said it was time for them both to be replaced!  Even at my age, he feels that I may not need another replacement in my lifetime, and only time will tell.  Just to have the pain gone for one day would be amazing!  I was so excited the first time I had the injections.  I walked out with no pain for the first time in 25 years!  I lost my flexibility long ago, which is a hindrance to my life.  I know having the hips replaced will not give me back the flexibility, and I will have to work to have that.  I am curious to know what others have experienced in that area?
I found Coffeeman's discussion to be very helpful, and I believe there is another member that has a link out there as well.  I'm doing all the reading I can to try to keep myself calm!
My surgeon said he is doing the ""superior"" approach, that I was not the right body type (tummy's too big!! LOL) for the Anterior approach.  I'm hoping that this means I will not have as much pain from the incisions and cut muscles as the Posterior approach.  I will know more in a couple of days, I suppose.
I did buy risers for my recliner, and my hubby is going to put a riser under the couch since I'll have to sleep downstairs for a bit.  I'm nervous, but I'm prepared.  I know there is a lot of pain and discomfort in my near future, but I will come out on the other side so much better!
I am open to any suggestions at this point!
Thank you for taking the time to read this.

"Hey there everyone i just want to speak about when is the right time for me to go back to work.
I have been off since Nov 7th last year.
Had 1st lthr on 9th Dec 2015
Had 2nd rthr on15th Feb 2016
I have been off work since before 1st thr.
I have a meeting in work this week to disguss my phased return when my doctors line runs out in mid July. Although l can't help feeling everyone including my family think l should be back. Like someone once said on this forum nobody cares after 3 months and l don't mean you lot of hippies l mean people that don't understand hip replacement.
I have to say l feel guilty and confused as to if l should be back already and am l the only one thats went through this about work.
I work full time as a bank manager in a admin and call centre l have worked there for 13 going on 14 years.
When l have been off to get all this done its made me think about my career. I know longer have the passion for furthering myself in banking l went as far as l wanted. Its just a job now that was dreading going to in the last year because it was becoming that stressful.
I am.lucky enough to have a choice for the 1st time in.my life of what to do. I could go part time when l go back as there is no longer any need for me to have a full time job as we have no kids and our mortgage is paid off in sept. I have no debt and my husband has a brilliant well paid job working from home. I know it seems l am extremley lucky but l have had to sacrifice a lot to get to this point.
One thing l will say is that l can't not work l will have to find part time work either with something that l really would love to do or voulenteer work with animals. Something that gets me out the house a few days.
But anyway right now at this point l am scared. As l have not got a regular sleeping pattern l wake up berween 1am and 4am every night and move down the stairs and sleep on couch. I still get really sore some days and some days l walk with a worse limp than others.
Is my mind playing tricks on me as it knows l don't really want to go back to were l work but know everyone is thinking l should be back.
How do l get up at half 5 everyday to go to work when l am not yet sleeping normal and still get a lot of days of pain.
Any suggestions or has anyone felt pressured to go back when they don't feel ready and have lost a lot of confidence.
Any help would be appriciated.
My mum.even said to me when l got up from a couch strugglung cause l was stiff. Whats up with you....your limping. Has she forgot altogether l have had both hips replaced in the space of 3 months yet she was so concerned about my sister who has had sinusitus twice in the last month. She said on the phone its a shame for your sister she is getting fed up off being ill...........eh hello l am here l am demented being ill for months. Right there l realised nobody understands how mentally draining this can be apart from us that has been through this. And my husband who is totally supporting any choice l make.
Has anyone else had this problem or anything like it. I want to know l am not the only one that feels invisable to there family and pressured to be back at work because 3 months have passed.
Thanks

"hello wonderful friends! Today is my 3 week anniversary from lthr and fracture repair. I am pain free and healing nicely. I still can only put 50% weight on my left leg and all of the precautions are still in place. I will return to my surgeon on 6/16 at which time he may relax some of the precautions based on the x rays. I feel so grateful to have the operation behind me and to be on my way to a new level of functioning. That having been said........ Here is my question: Are there others out there who are going a little stir crazy? I was not prepared for this sedentary, confining recuperation. There are days that feel never ending!!!! There are times when I feel hopeless and useless in my present condition. Like I'm stuck in limbo and it will never end! Am I alone in this, being ridiculous, impatient, etc? It quite frankly is very out of character for me. I can't seem to pull it together. I would so appreciate hearing from anyone else that may have gone or is going through this. I'm angry at myself for feeling this way. Thanks everyone for listening.

Can't stop admiring them! Equally frivolous, I worked out a way today of moisturising my own horrible dry legs instead if asking OH to do it. I bought one of those sponge on a stick things before my op 4 weeks ago. Today, I pulled an old sock over it, applied a liberal dollop of E45 and away I went! And by the way, 4 weeks in things are improving rapidly for me. Feels like a lifetime! Fingers crossed that it continues.

"I had a fall which resulted in a broken hip. I am nearly 4 wks post op from having a THR. What a shock to the system. I was working, taking my elderly mum out every day, swimming 3 times a wk. Now stuck in house doing exercises having ppl wait on me. iI can't even pick my new baby grandson up. I must say ppl have been so good sending cards, flowers, and chocolates.
Reading people's experiences of having THR has given me an idea of what to expect, although not every one is the same. I suppose I'm lucky as a lot of ppl have been suffering for yrs with hip pain. I just hope my op is a success and no long term pain from it. My brother has had 3 THR due to bad bones (i told my surgeon about him, he said mine were ok) he said he gets a lot more pain in the winter months.
I'll keep looking in on this site. Any new discussions may give me hints or tips on my recovery.

Feeling a bit dissopointed, they had me do some walking without my stick and my leg/ knee was bending inwards, she then strapped my knee up to give it more support but then this was causing more issuse in the hip joint and making me walk funny. She then tried a knee brace which also had the same effect, she is kind of stumped on what could be causing it, she suggested to wear some orthopedic shoes, i already have some so when i got home i tried and my leg is still not right. Just frustrated that this is the issue that is keeping me from waking un aided.

"I meant to post this on Friday, but have been wrestling with a computer issue...
I had my almost-6-month check up on Friday. I was worried about it because at my February check I was told the surgeon had not actually repaired the fracture which led to my surgery in the first place. I was warned that necrosis could set in due to the lack of blood supply and it could all still collapse.
Well, had my x-ray on Friday and it's all good. The doctor even said the fracture area is still alive and even seems to be healing. There is still a possibility of collapse, but he told me that if it happens it will be gradual, not sudden, which was a huge relief.
I can still feel the gadgetry inside and it does still often feel heavy. I do still get pain, particularly if I walk too much or otherwise exert too much. But I'm feeling pretty good these days and about to do some volunteer tour guide work which will have me on my feet for hours on end.
I now don't have to go back until early December, so am feeling confident!

He checked in a huge case & small duffel, so we requested wheelchair assistance at curbside in Honolulu.They help him through TSA, & wheel him to the gate. At his final destination, the terminal is HUGE & the distance unreal. They wheel him from the door of the plane to the baggage claim then to ground transport. Easy if there's a golf cart available but ridiculous if it's a wheelchair & a case to maneuver. They earn their tips! Delta is SUPERB as far as assistance. And son has learned to accept help when he needs it. When he doesn't, he'll feel frustrated, exhausted & angry.
Tomorrow he sees his GP for a plan of action & an x-ray of the right, deteriorating AVN hip. Also to try to get answers & help with the ongoing tiredness & waterfall sweating. The following week he sees the surgeon who operated on his left hip for a 3-month check. He is hoping to have RTHR as soon as possible. If this surgeon won't do it, the GP will help him get a second opinion. Or we might attempt to pay for it out of pocket.
I'll be here in Hawaii for 3 more weeks, then I return to join my son, as he's asked me for help in making this happen.
Mahalo for listening. This is certainly a journey, & It continues. I learn so much from all of you here about determination, persistence, courage, kindness & support for each other.

I have been for checkups with my consultant but no one has ever said what it is I actually have and why I am walking this bad and also in so much pain. I permantly have to go out with my crutch as I cant possible walk without it. Just recently I had to get a letter from my doctor about my dissability as I am appltying for a blue badge. That was when I found out I had Trendelenberg gait.The letter "" stated satisfactory hip replacement with avulsion of the greater trochanter"" I have done research on the internet and have realised that I could have had exercises that would help my gait but I was never told about this. I am due to go back to see my consultant in June as he says I may be able to go into hospital and try to have this rectified with an operation, he says it is a very intricate operation as it involves wires going through the muscle etc, Iam wondering has anyone else had this operation to rectify the problem, or can it be helped with the correct exercises. I cant believe I have gone nearly a year without any help to improve my condition. I am very depressed as I cant go anywhere without my crutch, I cant walk far without it being painful on my back and a dragging sensation on my operated hip. I am thing I am only 65years and I cant do anymore what I used to do. Is ther anyone out there that can give me a little hope for my future. Please.

"Hi,
Im 39 years old. Did my Total Hip Replacement (THR) on both my right and left hips 9 (2007) and 8 (2008) years ago respectively. 4 years (2012) after my left hip THR, i started to go to gym (weight lifting & running on treadmill). All went well until last week, when I had a cought (while standing) and immeditely I felt the pain on my right hip for certain movements, can't climb or get down from stairs. Went to see the doctor who did the operation, he did some lifting and bending on my both legs and said the pain not from the THR, its from the psoas muscle, due to the cought, where the cough air went to my back of my body. He suggested to bend a little when coughing. Gave me pain killer and muscle relax. Stopped the med after 2 days. today is my second day without the med. i don't have the pain..but sometimes my mind tells me there is pain...should i do a xray?

"Aloha!
My son had LTHR ten weeks ago & is here in Hawaii for a conference. The heat & humidity can be debilitating but it was after sunset when we walked from one end of the mall to the other. He tried on & bought jeans & a few drugstore items. By the time he was done & had walked back, he was winded, exhausted & sweating profusely.
The tiredness has come up in Lynn's & mentioned by Cels, Graham & others. It is son's greatest concern. He is facing an RTHR & can only wonder what additional effects that will have. It's hard to tell a 30 y/o to put his life on hold. Are any of you hippies able to overcome this lack of energy & stamina? Any suggestions are welcomed gratefully.
The sweating. He has never sweated like this. It all started with the opioid painkillers - he sweated & itched intensely in reaction to one of them. Have you experienced this, even weeks or months after the surgery?
Mahalo in advance for any advice or ideas you may have.

"I am getting closer to making a decision for THR.
What concerns me is that every one posting on the forum speaks about the pain as the reason for THR.
In my case I am walking with severe limp,unable to stand upright with left side bent at the hip.
My recent appt. with a specialist has described me as having a short leg gait,Trendelenburg positive on the left hand side.
As far as I am concerned,for me pain alone is not a good enough reason to subject my body to the trauma of surgery.
I don't know if a THR would solve the uneven gait problem.

"The reason I am asking the question is that compared with others my
condition and pain level does not seem too bad.
I have seen one specialist who told me I am bone on bone and has mentioned in his letter to my GP the Trendelenburg gait.
I am now waiting for an appt. to see a specialist who does the Anterior approach.That was why I requested the referral in the first place but on keeping the appt. found that I was in the wrong clinic.
The Dr.I saw was very nice but could not give info.about the Anterior approach.
Having received a copy of his letter to my GP I looked up Trendelenburg gait and one of the causes mentioned is reaction to THR.
All very confusing.
Thank you to all who have answered so generously and promptly.
Only one person describes the same symptoms as mine but it is reassuring to get that feedback
I will be 80 in ten days time and don't want to take a decision that might make things worse.
You are all much braver than me, this is after all a serious operation,an assault on the body and not a decision to be taken lightly.
I will update when I have hopefully seen the Anterior specialist.
Best wishes with gratitude to all who have responded.

In NZ there is very little followup from a THR - the clearance meeting with my surgeon took about 10 mins, he showed me my xray, asked about my wound healing ( Id had a very bad time with my first THR - took 4.5 months for the wound to finally heal) told me my next followup appointment is in 5 years and bustled me out of the door.  So I'm doing rehab pilates, walking the streets of Auckland in 2/3 km slots and teaching dancing a couple of nights a week.  I'm also working with the best muscle therapy massage team around on a weekly basis.  I haven't tried high heels yet - and wont for a few more weeks.  I have to remind myself that its ONLY 9 weeks and I'm doing OK.  Everytime I try a ""something"" that I haven't done since before my THR it takes a while and take a bit out of me.  My danceing students are amazed at what I can do right now.  And I must remember to be amazed for myself, otherwise I could expect too much.

"Hi, I'm 51, female, active. In May 15 I had hip arthroscopy - to remove damaged round ligament, labral tear repaired BUT have a 2p size of cartilage on front of femoral head missing - in the critical weight bearing area, causing ongoing stabbing pains in my joint. In 12 months since, I've had 4 x lots of hyaluronic acid injections - these have helped but not lasted very long and each time, pain has come back worse than before. Also have ongoing related problems with gluetual tendonopathy & Sacroiliac joint pain. Just had further set of injections in each area (3 total) under sedation & it all wears off after 4-6 weeks. Surgeon now talking 'total hip replacement' and I am totally feaked out by the thought of having bone cut out and metal put in. Surgeon keeps telling me really I'm too young. So - the options appear to be:
1) THR
2) Bham Hip Resurface.
3) Something else?   In between?  I do not have arthritis in the joint..
My mum had the Birmingham hip resurfacing 20 years ago, and 2nd one 15 years ago - she's had no problems at all - despite being very overweight. But I am not being offered resuracing as my surgeon only seems to do THR. I am aware of the metal fragments issue with resurfacing.
My current surgeon is offering THR (he does not seem to do any resurfacing). . How can I be sure which one would suit best - THR or resurface or is there anything in between?  I realise that resurfacing is a specialist field as well & best done by experts in these i.e. McMinn or Treacy. Anyone any thoughts?

"In 2010 following a fall I was given a dynamic Hip screw .This failed and had a full hip replacement (plastic cup, cobalt chrome head, titanium stem) I became increasingly ill and in pain and a pseudotumour was diagnosed. The head was replaced by ceramic and masses of necrotic tissue and muscle was removed.The head was black ,pitted and corroded. I was told that this was due to Galvanic action between the head and stem creating basically battery acid that caused the damage.Has this affected anyone else?I know I'm not the only person to have suffered with his problem.

"While out this morning walking the dogs, my husband spoke to an older woman walking with alpine poles. She had a bit of a limp so he asked her if she had just had hip surgery. It turns out she was 4 weeks post op and possibly in her 70s. As she explained to him, she couldn't get on walking with two canes but found the poles very easy. So he went out and bought me a set with shock absorption! Just wondering if anyone else has tried these?

"21st May 2015
It's now 12 months since I had my lthr done. I thought I would try and update you as to how it's been.
I had a spinal with sedation - never saw, heard or felt anything.
Stayed in hospital for 4 days, learnt how to use crutches and to walk again.
I slept, did excersies twice a day. Rested in the afternoons.
After a coouple of weeks I started walking outside, it was wonderful but very slow. I had 6 weeks physiotherapy and 2 x 6 week sessions in the hydrotherapy facility. These were great expecially the hydrotherapy.
We had some ups and downs. Alan had a blood clot on his lungs 3 weeks after my op, that was a difficult time for both of us. Neither of us could drive which made it difficult.
I have atrial fibrulation and have had a flare up of that which knocked me back a lot and bought me to a standstill.
We did however have a lovely holiday on the Norfolk Broads, and are looking forward to a holiday again this year without restrictions.
Glad to say Alan is thriving again and so am I, don't know what I would have done without him, he is my rock and keeps me going just pushing me a little further yet making me rest when I should do, calling me stubborn most of the time cos I won't give in.

Things I can do now
1. Walk miles without pain
2. Garden (haven't done that for over 12 months.)
3. Mow the Lawns (not done that for 2 years.)
4. I can drive again long distances. (Treated myself to a new automatic Car)
5. Can get onto my knees (and back up again)!!
6. I can do pretty much do anything I want to do but like to push the boundaries, just to see what it's like.
I have done so much knitting it's unreal, but many benefits for our grandson and neice lol.
I have also learned to have patience, boy that was hard because I want to do everthing yesterday, not have to wait until tomorrow.
Both of us have learned to take each day as it comes and enjoy what we do together to the best and fullest of our abilities.
I apologise for this lengthy post, but to all you who have just had your op, take your time it will happen, you will be able to do things you didn't know you could or had forgotten you ever did. For those of you waiting, I hope you have your op done soon and return to doing the things you had to give up because of the pain. For each and everyone of you on this forum I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being there helping, guiding, and sending the love and hope as and when needed.
It was the best decision I have made, it has given me my life back.
Love and best wishes to all

"53 year old male that has been having pain for the past 1-2years.  Went to the doctor last year and it was apparent that I would need a THR but wanted me to wait until ""I would know when"".  Well starting in Feb the pain has really started to go up, each month since then worse and worse.  Now it is May and ""I know when""!  So went in for another set of x-rays and they showed a pretty significant increase in deterioration. 
So now I am just waiting on the call that the insurance is all good to go and then get put on the surgery schedule.  I'm hoping for 1st week of Aug. 
Until then I plan on continuing to walk and keep as active as I can, golf etc. Any other suggestions?  Did you all need to get a walker or was crutches or a cain good enough when you first get home?  I'm lucky that I have a first floor master and a walk-in shower, so getting around will be fairly easy at home.  I am planning on getting back to work by week 4, that is my goal.  I work at a desk so I will be able to keep rested etc.

"Hi all, 
I thought I would give you all a little update on my recovery.  Its now 2 weeks post op (surgery 4th May) and I have been very pleased with how things have gone.  I had 3 nights in hospital which I will be honest and will say were not pleasant at all as I was in a lot of pain and I couldnt sleep.  However at some point on the Friday the pain levels dropped off and they let me go home on the Saturday once they were sure I could manage the crutches okay.  
My range of movement has improved every day and I now have pretty good control over my leg again, although lifting up when lying down is stil very difficult.  I'm still on two crutches when I'm walking about outside and will be for another week.  Inside I tend just to use one crutch as my house is just too small to make two crutches practical.  Pain levels are good and I only have pain in and around the surgery area. The main issue I have is that i get horrendous night spasms which I have mentioned in another post.  I've tried every remedy and they just dont work.  I guess they will sort themselves out once the leg heals and the swelling goes down.

"I was told I have a pinched femoral nerve that shoots down my left leg, was at to have back surgery to ""fix"" this pain when I decided to have my hip looked at. Class 4 osteoarthritis, need hip replacement. Yaay, pain relieved and no back surgery! Nope.... was in overt night after surgery, came home, typical post surgery pains. Last few nights and says have not been fun. The nerve pain or maybe it's bone pain, starts at my groin area (where the tendons, nerves attach hip and control leg) and goes down to my knee. So uncomfortable I can't sleep or sit for very long. I've hobbled fire a few years now, but if I'm conscious, I can spelt walk normal. My left hip was lower than my right hip so figured this would correct my back and walking and pain.
Does anyone else have that pain? I can do all My exercises except cannot lift my leg straight up on the air. Perhaps I strained the tendons or nerve again? That pain was gone until I started doing those leg lifts.
Thank you

"The most awful thing was to see son limp right after the fall. And he said he didn't want to blame me. But I still felt bad.
He did use his cane at the conference, as we had to walk far, and up & down stairs. He still walks faster than me as my knee has been a problem. Just what we need - another one with a limp!
Because the registration was so disorganized, he got to the presentation room with only ten minutes to spare & was nervous & sweaty. But he did really well - was poised, ad-libbed, showed a sense of humor. Not bad for someone who had one hour of sleep! There were other sessions but he said he knows his limit.
He thanked me for my help by taking me to eat sushi for lunch. He is taking two 650mg acetaminophen & two 220mg naproxen a day - which I think are well under the maximum for both. We had seen the story of a pro hockey player who had two hip replacements because he took too much naproxen, and he expressed worry about that. He brought Norco with him but hasn't had to take it.
Later that night he realized there was a luau, so went there to get something to eat & spoke to a few classmates & professors.
Sorry this is so long. Mahalo to all for listening/reading.

"Hooray....!  Just received the all clear on the echocardiogram.  Six weeks of  misery, wondering what was wrong - Right Bundle Branch Block, not an unusual finding in an ecg, and incidental to it.  Not usually followed up,but  I am told that with all other findings of this type, surgery is cancelled and an echo required.  So, the long and short of it all is that surgery can now go ahead.  
It looks as though surgery will occur in the next 4-6 weeks, but no firm date, yet.  I am wondering, as surgery is likely to be some time in May, when the weather will be good - hopefully, I shall probably want to spend some part of the day sitting on my patio.  My garden chairs will not be suitable due to their design.  Has anyone come across a comfortable garden chair  that I can buy, or any means of adapting what I already have?  It is too low, the seat is moulded so that the back of the seat dips and the thighs are curving upwards, which would make a dislocation likely.  Any help or suggestion would be enormously appreciated.

"I am just wondering what everyone is doing for therapy after surgery. My SIL, who lives in Yorkshire, fell off a horse, snapped her femur and had emergency THR the next day. She was given some restrictions (which she totally ignored) and told to simply ""walk"", with a cane.
I have had OA for at least ten years, been in pain for five years and unable to walk much in the last six months. My surgery was elective and I was given an extensive regime of graduated exercises to increase my flexibility and strengthen muscles around the joint. I must walk with aids in both hands and use a 3"" cushion for sitting at all times. All for the full seven weeks before I have my follow-up.
Nothing was said about walking as therapy although I do walk in our apartment every day and sometimes walk the halls or go down to the garden. I am to start different exercises at different stages in my recovery and do them 2-4 times per day.

"I have been at my absolute wits end trying to hurry this recovery along, why is it taking so long simply to get to the loo, why is it taking so long to simply move my leg, why on earth can I not walk far without pain....and so the list went on and on and on....
In hindsight, at the grand age of five months post op I can see EXACTLY why I rushed my recovery, why I was so impatient to be better, why I was constantly measuring myself against everyone and anyone else.
I was terrified I would not get better, I was terrified quietly that I would never walk, never rid myself of the pain, limp or both.....deep inside I was scared I would be forever disabled.
Looking back this fear must be completely natural and happens to the best of us, but actually five months on I WISH I had been more gentle, more patient, less worried and spent my time resting, relaxing and taking my time with the process. It is the most natural thing in the world to want to be better of course, but please everyone have some confidence that you WILL get there, all time frames are different, all journeys vary slightly - be gentle with yourself, when you feel better make the most of the time off (no one gives a damn three months in trust me) Enjoy the time with your loved ones and family and be reassured you would know about it if something was wrong....so rest, relax, exercise, take care and be patient. It is all okay. You will get there, you really will....

"OK so I am 15 weeks post op and am ready to get fit again.  Walking no problem. Still a bit stiff when I first stand up from sitting but once I get going I am good.  I have been back at the gym on the cross trainer and stationary bike and doing some weights and doing floor ecercises. Getting up and down off the floor still clumsy.
However I have taken the plunge and bought myself a brand new shiny bike.  The shop owner said I should try before I buy and he brought out a kind of bike that Miss Marple may have chosen.  . So under the wathcful eye of everyone I wheeled the bike outside and tried to find a safe place to get on.  I was very anxious I can tell you.  Cars everywhere all waiting to knock me down.  However I gulped down the nerves and tried to get on this thing.  A step through frame made it easier than my last bike. (I feel sorry for hippy guys who don't have this option).  I got off to a wobbly start and once I was going I was fine as long as I didnt have to stop or turn. Bringing the bike back I thought it was a bit sedate for my liking so I tried out a much nimbler hybrid that earned me extra street points. So I bought it and get it on Thursday.  I will be fine as long as I dont fall off.
Any more hippies back cycling?

"Something like this happens when he's exhausted (12+ hour from his apartment to airport, connection on coast, flight over Pacific, wheeled to baggage claim at the far eastern end of the Honolulu airport.) He feels helpless when he depends on airline people & tried to be independent by grabbing the luggage & carryon. Well, I had a good hold on the latter & this caused him to fall. On the unoperated hip that's showing early signs of deterioration. My fault entirely. He is staying in a hotel so he can take the shuttle to the conference. I went up to his room with him - carrying most of his things, made him an ice pack, gave him some acetaminophen, quickly read over his presentation, & watched him eat some of the food I brought him.
The good - he seems OK. The bad - that hip hurts more now than it ever did. It is almost 10 weeks since the LTHR & he's recovered physically but is so easily exhausted.
It is bad of me to think this, but perhaps if the fall did some damage, he might have the RTHR sooner.
I am glad he's home & I can help him.
Thank you all for listening.

"This is just a small message to say a big massive well done to all the mothers who have children from babies upwards that have somehow navigated this huge and life changing operation with children in tow with little or no help. It is huge, incredibly challenging and you don't even have the time to cry or to ask for help...so this message is for you.
I look back now and can not believe I managed with two children at 3 and a half weeks post op on my own full time - a huge 15 hours a day, I was still on two crutches and could not even get dressed or do the basics. How I did it is still beyond me....but we did! We all got through it!....
and to all those patients in the throes now...my biggest and best hug goes to you. We all have a long recovery, but cooking, cleaning, caring for others and trying to get better - it is nothing short of heroic. 
So if you are exhausted reading this, know that other mothers have trodden the same path, cried the same tears of desperation but overcome all...to eventually play with our children once again as I did today. It is all worth it in the end...

"Well next week i go to see my surgeon for my 6 week check. Rather nervous to say the least. I have been doing little unaided steps around my bedroom but have found that i cannot walk properly, my leg doesnt want to go straight forward, it wants to go in a circle movent which makes me walk very oddly. So i dont think i will be ditching the crutches anytime soon.
Still get the random odd pain in my hip and legs, but unfortanelty the chronic pain in my back has stayed which i have found when sittinf in a normal chair or when im doing the ironing. Im very upset about this.
Had an appointment to see my surgeon who is going to operate on my collar bone today. I was told the risks of this surgery are a punctured lung or that if he accidently cuts the major artery that is just under the bone I could bleed out and die on the table. Such a lovely thought. He also said they would have to remove a peice of my hip to put in my shoulder. Thats all i need. I was told i was incredibly unlucky as i havent even developed scar tissue which is what usually happens if the bones dont heal and its rare for that to not happen.

However I was hoping to find out if Anterior approach would be suitable,available or best for me.
To get that answer I have to wait for another consultation with a different team.

"After a very bad fall I am now home! Operated on 25 April 2016. I have had a left THR after breaking the Femur. It is 15 days since the op. I am having a bit of physio and doing exercises at home. My left groin is sore. My leg feels ok during the day but when I wake up at 4am/5th my leg is pain full. How long does it take before the tenderness goes away bearing in mind that muscles and tissues have to grow back. Is exercising and physio a good thing after my op. Thank you.

"Been to see my surgeon 6 1/2 weeks post op. So pleased with my results I could cry. He does not want to see me for 1 year.
My legs are the same length they were not post op. My non operated hip is fine. I walk unaided and I am pain free and do not take any medication apart from the occasional paracetamol.
I asked some questions
My surgeon likes to keep restrictions in place for 12 weeks but abit more relaxed. I can bend down as long as I put my operated leg behind me.
He says swelling is common for up to 12 weeks .
I cannot have a bath for 12 weeks as I may struggle to get back up.
Driving long distance is not recommended for 12 weeks due to dvt.
He does not like anterior approach as he does not see the benefits, he trained in Canada but of course that is just his opinion.
Do not put your leg outwards and move your foot to the side to put socks on as this is the riskiest procedure which can cause dislocation.
Hope this is useful but it's just his opinion and there are so many out there.

" 6 weeks post op and I'm going backwards (uncemented) .  I had got going round home with no crutches, now I have pain in the groin which I put down to pre-op lack of use and back using the crutch all the time.  Thought things were going too well!
 I just wondered if any of you got a pain all the way across the bottom of your back it is driving me crackers, I still do excercises and walk for about 10-15 mins 3 times a day but the back is agony, I do have disc problems but this usually affects my buttock or leg and it's not that kind of pain.  Because of all the restrictions I find it impossible to do all the rehab excercises for my back the best I can manage is a very small bridge and pelvic tilt.  I had just got down to 1 tramadol every 36 hours and paracetamol I really don't want to go back on the tramadol it's such a major to get off with the sweats and aching.
Sorry it's a negative one.
Any help would be gratefully appreciated.

I'm beginning to get excited/nervous about my forthcoming RTHR on June 8th & am trying to plan as much in advance as possible. We have been invited to a close friends wedding 7 weeks after my OP & I'm starting to think about what to wear. I don't think I'll be able to wear heels so would anyone know where I can get some nice flats that would look right with a dress. I'm also hesitant about buying anything now as summer season clothes aren't in the shops yet & I'm also losing weight so will hopefully have dropped a bit more by my OP date. Then, on the other hand, I'm thinking 'will I be fit enough to go clothes shopping after'. I don't think it would be appropriate to turn up in my joggers!

"I am just checking in to let you know that I am doing well. I have been home for a week now and other than difficulty with pain meds (switched to Oxy with no side effects), I am up and around now using crutches and a walking frame.
I am sleeping through the night, on my back, getting myself to the bathroom, having daily showers, doing my physio, eating well and resting often. My ankles were swollen when I got home but are better now after elevating them and icing my leg.
I removed my dressing two days ago and the scar looks good. No problems with it so far. My main issue is tiredness and stamina. I sleep most nights 8-10 hours and another two in the afternoon. I can't do much that involves using my hands, while standing up.
So I guess I will just listen to my body and slow things down for now. It hasn't even been two weeks! Amazing isn't it? I was going to post a photo of my incision but wasn't sure if that would be well received or not. If you are interested in seeing it, let me know.

I'm now struggling (more because of insecurity) as the leg is swelling badly around the knee and ankle and is more painful around the incision site too. I wasn't given any specific physio exercises and was discharged in codeine and paracetamol.   
Questions: is there anything I can do to help with the swelling?
is there any recommended continues pain relief for first couple of weeks?
are there any exercises I should be doing even at this stage? 
Hope me those of you who have been through this might be able to offer some words of wisdom or reassurance.

"Hi all! Well,I tried to apply for social security/disability.It takes 3-5 mos and always are denied the first 2 times. 6 -10 mos wasnt going to cut it. My job prior to surgery said they couldnt take me back w restrictions-and that they dont have to have my position for me due to not being on FMLA before surgery.  I wasnt on FMLA because I could barely walk for a year w a square hip hanging out of my pelvis,so I was down to PT. 27 hours a week,while the Drs gave me injections every other month and made me try therapy as part of the hoops one must jump thru before they say go to surgery. So I argued and begged and faught to get my job back.Am working 15 hrs for the next 2 weeks and then increase.I started back on the 8th week post op. Dr said I could go back after 2 weeks of Hydrotherapy at the 6 week mark, cuz my gait is still so off and I still use a cane,but never had the therapy,insurance will not approve. So went to work anyway. Hurts alot!! Groin pain so severe from psoas!! The trochanteric bursitis and the sciatica from the spondylolethesis and spinal stenosis is unbearable!! BUT gotta do it. No other choice. I dont suppose living in my car or under a bridge would hurt any less. I came home today from work and 2 errands-in and out of car 8 times its SO HARD getting in and out!  im sitting here on ice and crying-its as bad as before surgery! I just dont know what to do? There is nothing I can do THIS IS all I can do! I must work for 6-10 mos at least while waiting to hear from SSD. Im going to call the Dr next week and tell him its painfull and ask him to up my pain meds?! Any advice? OHH lets just go with Lovely to be working and driving and grocery shopping again! This is SO NOT what I was expecting.

"I thought after reading many other recoveries that after a week or so id be walking unaided and able to do so many things I couldnt before or have ever done.
I couldnt have been more wrong. Im struggling to walk on my crutches for more than 10 minutes before I have to stop. Have to go out in a wheelchair otherwise I would never get out the house, although I never realised how ignorant people are until you are in a wheelchair or attempting to walk with the crutches.
Im also beginning to wonder if iv even made the right choice. I thought the surgery would help with the chronic pain in my back, it was a huge factor in my choice, just seems to have made it worse.
Its scary to think im 20, with a hip replacement, 12 or 13 surgeries under my belt, severe OA in both knees and something wrong with my spine and going in for another surgery to reset my collar bone, quite probable future knee replacements and the possibility i may not be able to have a revision on my hip once the time comes.
But what I am meaning by this post is that every person is different. We are all going to have pain after surgery, we are all going to heal at different rates but one day we may get a second chance because of this surgery. It is crucial that we do not compare others recoveries to our owns because that is not how it works. Take your time in your recovery, theres no rush, there is years ahead of us all that quite frankily might be the best years of our lives because of our new hips. Or in my case my first ever real hip. Such an odd thought after years of never having one

"I'm getting ready to leave the MidWest to return to Hawaii. Son is planning to relocate in August, so I was going to come back in July to help him. 
He seemed to be recovering well from LTHR - until yesterday, when he woke up with pain in the RIGHT hip, which hadn't given him any trouble before. The MRI from a week ago showed that AVN is present & spreading in the right hip. I know most of you on this forum do not have AVN, but my reading shows AVN leads to OA.
My question is: Does OA usually progress this fast?
Son had no pain at all until August 2015.
Now, I'm so worried. I don't know whether to go or stay if he needs psychological support.

"I saw a physiotherapist last Friday and she was very pleased with me. I had just started feeling confident to not use the crutches and she agreed I could do it. She also said i could drive! yay. She gave me a resistance band to use on my ankles and do the leg out to the side exercise. It's SO much harder, but is the only way to strengthen the muscles around the hip. She didn't think my legs were different length, because apparently most people have slight differences normally.She was so knowledgable about the body and muscles , I was very impressed. The hamstring is in shock after surgery which explains the pain behind the knee where it attaches.The back ache should get better in time, again the muscles are just reacting to the hip ones being cut, and this puts the pelvis out of bonk.It's all to do with listening to our bodies, not overdoing things. Having said that I'm back at work 3 days a week to start off with. I work in a lab, so there's standing and sitting. My colleagues are very protective and make sure I don't overdo it. 
Anyway, thats my news. For all those people in early stages of recovering, I did notice a real change at about 6 weeks, so be patient -it does get better.
Good luck to all

"I won't leave a link here, but if you Google ""Oxycontin LATimes"" you'll see that Purdue, the manufacturer, lobbied/lobbies widely with U.S. doctors & surgeons to prescribe this to their patients. Because it does NOT deliver the 12 hours of relief as marketed, it is ripe for abuse. Even in trials 12 hour relief was not the norm, it was more like 8 hours. Doctors were just told to prescribe a bigger dosage rather than a more frequent one. Of course, the object of this deception was/is $$$$$$$$$$.
This is what son was prescribed postop, and I do remember it did not last 12 hours.

"It's something that started slow and I understood.. After my surgery, when I was ""laid up"" those first few days, I had a gazillion people come by. People did my grocery shopping, took my dog for a walk, sat w me while I got in and out of the tub, brought me food and milkshakes, took me to the doctor, picked up prescriptions.. Called to check on me. 
Then, slowly, you realize some people have stopped calling and you understand. 
Then, your good friends start to stop coming over and say things like ""why don't you walk your dog?"" or ""YOU can walk down the road to the mailbox"" and it was not that I couldn't do it, I was a bit scared to fall or lose my balance, but I did start doing for myself. More and more, started driving myself to PT. 
Seems like every conversation I had with people had something to do with my hip, or I had hair falling out, or I was depressed, or I didn't have an appetite, or lost weight. 
I missed the birthday party of one of my BEST friends... and she was so upset, she left me a voicemail ( I think she was tipsy ) and said, ""You didn't come to my party, you didn't even call to tell me why, so you know? Have a nice life, I'm through with you, I love you but I just give up, again, I love you but have a nice life, I can't do this anymore"" Well??? That's pretty harsh for missing a birthday party... and especially from such a good friend. 
Less emails or text messages. Another friend, she does my hair. She gave me a gift certificate for free color and cut, then she needed $100 to make her mortgage payment the next day...now, I've never heard a word from her. I haven't talked to her for so long, finally she said ""how about Monday?"" on Monday, she called and said ""I'm just in a funk, and I can't do your hair, but I'll call when I can work it in"" Now, weeks and weeks later, still no call. I don't want to bug her because she certainly knows about the hair and the money both. So, one is avoiding me. One good friend, he met a girl and she was jealous and we never had anything going on, worked together for 15 years, lives right next door. He calls and say's ""we can't be friends anymore, my girlfriend doesn't believe a man and woman can ""just"" be friends. So... I'm sorry. That was back about a month post op near Christmas. He never called once, ""can I pick you up some things from the store?"" ""How are you coming along?"" Nothing... and even though I told him I understood, I felt like I was just tossed aside w no consideration for my feelings. He just texted last week and said ""do you think we'll ever talk to each other again?"" WHAT?? I said ""Right now, I really don't know"" and left it at that. Another good friend, who lives in Perth, known for 9 years, I'm always writing her about the hip or I'm driving or my doctor is mean or my scar is horrible and she wrote me an email last night, she didn't say ""me"" by name, but she said her body, ( she has arthritis and bone cancer and breast cancer ) She's good w her cancers, but she aches and stays in bed a lot. If she can, she'll go to walk on the beach. (btw, the average price for a house there is $600,000 and a pack of cigarettes is $50 ) Well, she's very cool, had a website called Reinventing Myself full of great articles. So, her email said that she'd been in pain and that she felt like a sin eater, that when she gives her energy away to other people, it makes her weaker and weaker. That she needs some lightness in her life, free from problems, free from drama, politics etc.. and I know she meant I was dragging her down and sucking the energy out of her. That she needed a ""break"" again, not mentioning my name. To build her energy, and to feel better. I wrote back and apolgized for anything I'd done, that I know I'd loaded her down with my problems, and I didn't realize it. She had said all the energy she is losing is literally killing her. So, I didn't take it personally, I just told her I understood and for her to get well.. and she sent a link from youtube ""access"" a place where they have discussions on healing your body, and how to get rid of problems, etc... so, I got the picture after watching the video. So, it was like, 1, then 2, then 3, and now #4. I can't afford to lose anymore friends. At this age, you only have a handful of good ones. I don't know what to do to change or repair these frienships. It's hard to not have someone to call, if they won't answer your call. They see it's you, and just let it go to voice mail, then never call you back. I emailed another friend and said ""I don't mean to bug you, but I haven't even talked to you since April 14th!"" She said there was nothing wrong, that she was getting her dad settled in an assisted living center, she was his chauffer, did his shopping and she also has twin 11 year old boys. But.. I had emailed her and thought ""here is another person who doesn't care to talk to me anymore"" I have some issues with anxiety, and sometimes just don't want to go to parties or be around groups of people. I shouldn't get a ""have a nice life' phone call. Now, I'm afraid to say anything to anybody... ""my dog has constipation"" or ""I took a nice hot bath"" because my days are really not that interesting.

"Went for my checkup, 11 weeks tomorrow. I told him I stopped using my stick, couple of days ago, still have trouble going upstairs, like I can feel the implant. He made me walk up and down, I still have a bit limp but I thought I hadn't, then I had to sit on the bed and he checked leg length, it was ok. Said the x ray was good, never thought to tell him I fell the day after that in hospital., took a pic of it. He got me to stand and do the exercise where you lift your leg out to the side, that was fine, then told me to hold it, I couldn't.
So I have to lie on the bed on my good side and lift and hold the bad side and do it while standing as well.
I had loads of questions but forgot them and I have to go back 3-4 month, got an appointment for 4 month.
I had gone out the room and realised he didn't say I was clear of precautions. I asked the nurse and went back in, he said what precautions, that was it total blank, I said sleeping on back, back to work.Said another 4 -6 weeks off work, go back when I'm ready. I don't know if I'm allowed to drive, lower seating, bending, or what. He did say to continue sleeping on back, I can sleep on my good side as long as I use a pillow between my legs.  As I will probably be back to work before I see him again, I guess I will have to play by ear.
Really wanted to know how to get down on the floor and back up, whether it was needed to have antibiotics before dental treatment, and I can't remember the rest.
So I'm in a bit of a blubby mood tonight and I'm not going to phone work yet, cos I'll just start up again.
Sorry for the long post.

"My October LTHR went well as did my recovery.  I've been back at the gym for the past 3 months and doing some pilates at home - all with no problems.  
Two weeks ago I did a hike with lots of hills and about a week later, my knees started to hurt when going up and down stairs and i've begun limping very badly, to the point where I need to use either a cane or a walker again.
Five days ago, I began feeling extremely dizzy when i got out of bed; the dizziness lasts for hours, eventually passing until the next morning.
I'm travelling at the moment but did pop into an emergency two days ago to be reassured by a doctor that I had not, in fact, dislocated my hip.
My thinking is that I put my body out of alignment with that hour and a half hilly hike and simply need a good straightening-out by a chiro.
Your valuable input, dear hippies - PLEASE and THANK YOU!!!

"I am home after surgery on Tuesday. What an ordeal! The pain after surgery was more than I was expecting. It was actually quite shocking. I didn't tolerate the hrydromorphone well so after the third day, they switched me to Oxy which seems to work better, with no stomach upset.
So I am home now and everything is an ordeal. My husband is trying but he doesn't seem to get it. Thankfully, my Mom is coming today and a girlfriend is staying with us starting Monday night. Maybe women are just more instinctual when it comes to caring for others?
Anyway, I can't seem to lift or move my operated leg very well at all. Plus this morning, it seemed like I could feel the appliance ""working"" inside my joint. Is this normal? It felt very strange. I am constantly worried about dislocation and wonder how you know if you've done it?
Anyway, just thought I would check in to let you know I am alive. I also wanted to check on others here who were getting their surgery this week. Happy Saturday everyone!

"I had a RTHR 6 weeks ago and am going to have my left hip done in a few months.
I went to a play tonight with my girlfriend but it was a full house and we had to park a long ways away. Our seats were up top so a long stair climb. After the show I had to have my girlfriend pick me up at the front door of the theatre. I haven't walked that far in 8 months. I had been fealing good lately but now it's 2am and I'm in too much pain to sleep.
Even though I feel good I have to remember to take it easy. Baby steps.

"Well everyone, I had my hip replaced yesterday (4/5/2016) and all would seem good.  After my last post I kind of dropped off the forum as I was constantly trying to convince myself that I was making a mistake and that I should be trying to delay things until I could no longer walk / function. However I just focused on the reasons I was doing it and my family and friends were great in reminding me how much I have struggled for the last 4 years. What also didn't help was that my pain levels dropped off in the week before surgery. I told my surgeon this on the day and he assured me it was mind over matter... or something to that effect!
The day of surgery wasnt great as I had to be in at 7:30 and surgery was at 13:00 which was a long time to be sat with my thoughts. So much so when my surgeon came round I found myself quite emotional which I didnt expect. Anyway he talked me through things and assured me this was the right course of action as the x-rays showed my hip to be in a terrible state and he actually came in to the recovery area and told me the joint was in a dire state. So I am happy I made the right decision!
I managed to get through the first night with the help of some super strong morphine and, unfortunately, the dreaded catheter was required! Today I have seen a multitude of people.  The main shock to the system was being sat up and made to take a few steps with the zimmer frame and finding my leg weak and unresponsive.  I can see a long road to recovery ahead of me, but what is life without its challenges?
My aim is to be able to go to Muncih in 4 months time for the Octoberfest and maybe, just maybe, be back on the golf course again!

"here is the deal. Sitting has become a painfull nightmare. Please help if anyone has found a cushion that helps. 
Have looked at loads on Amazon and ""healthcare"" sites.   But thought with the vast experience of hippy friends you might be able to help?
Have looked at the Repose air filled cushion that our District Nurses give out like smarties. Expensive so must be good!  However it is nort a skin integrity issue as you all know. So I am thinking more of a memory foam thing. 
Girly week in Greece in two weeks and 4 hour plane trip which I am beginning to dread. Had no idea of the OA and pending hip replacement when it was booked. 
Booked as a revenge for the ""boys"" skiing trip - think grey hair here!
The pain is so getting me down. I comfort myself with the thought that it is not life threatening and we are lucky enough to have the option  of a replacement joint. Terrifying as it is!!!!!
So girly trip is not going to be what I thought. NO tennis for me, I will be ""looking after"" the sun loungers!
like a lot of us I was always the power house and thought I had a pulled hip flexor for ages!  Now hobbling around like an old lady. I hate it. 
Sorry turned in to a bit of a rant. !
 Any help with the cushion thing would be gratefully received. 
The picture is of my dog Alfie. Constant companion and makes me go for a walk every day- thanks Alfie!

"Hi all
I'm 41 and had a left total hip replacement 9 days ago - ceramic uncemented. I had a bad time in hospital and didn't leave until day 5 as kept spiking a temp and wasn't mobilising til day 2 post op. I don't know what to expect of all of this. I know I went into hospital with high expectations and didn't think I would be going through hell and back and thought once the diseases joint was replaced I would be good to go. Day 9 - I'm walking with 2 crutches. I cannot bend down at all and trying to lift my left up - straight leg raise is an impossible task - it feels like my leg is not connected. The pain is getting easier - and now down to same meds as I was on pre op - oxycodone 20mg modified release twice a day and regular paracetamol. The pain is still horrid tho - like my leg has been totally chopped off.
How did everyone else get on at 9 days? When will I be able to lift my leg up? Am I being too hard on myself ? Night times are the worse as I just cannot get comfortable and cannot roll over and since the op I get terrible night time leg twitches. I really hope things get better. The stupid thing is I am a very experienced ED nurse but have never being a patient in my life before or having experience in hip surgery so I just don't know what to expect - all I know is that I'm so fed up at the min :-( I never thought it would be this hard

"Well I will be 4 weeks on Monday and have noticed it s going to be a very long recovery. Im non weightbaring at the moment and decided to be daring and test putting a small amount if weight on operated side, body told me that was a very firm no. I also havent been able to walk for more than around 8 minutes (with crutches) so obviously dont get very far yet haha. Cannot see me being able to walk without aids by the time my 6 weeks ap comes along but im ok with that because I know just how complex  my op was.
My leg is still pointing out at an odd angle (photo below) and cannot bring my feet together if i stand with feet flat on floor. I also think there is some LLD
Went to college yesterday in my wheelchair as advised but just sat on a normal chair, well thats when my chronic back pain kicked in and by the end of the less i could barely sit as my hip and back were killing me, this worries me as this was exactly what i was like before surgery. Handed in evidence of my surgery to give to exam board to see if i am awarded special requirements for my exams in a few weeks, i have been told not to expect getting that help.
Scar is healing nicely, all 11 inches of it, I have now got 20 inches worth of surgical scaring down my left leg but I wear my surgical battle scars with pride and cant wait to get my new one out when I manage to get back in the pool.
I also hope this post helps those who believe they are 'not doing enough, or progressing' at any stage in there recovery, it will take time. There is no need to force ourselves to do stuff we cant, i know i wont be pushing myself to limits i cannot reach and will take my recovery with teeny tiny steps

"Well l am now 9 weeks post op for 2nd hip replacement and 1st was done in december. Today l have woke up at 4am wih the hot sweats l used to get right after my ops and pains in both my legs at the hips and down front of my legs.
I thought l waa past that stage and have being doing good. I still get sore backs from time to time and if l have done to much the occasional bad day. But the last few days l have been feeling like l am back at week 3 for both legs. I feel a bit down as l thought by now l would almost be back to normal. But l am far from it. I have been off work since november last year and have just got another doctors line for 2 months. Which is taking me into july. I realise l have had 2 hips replaced and its a lot on my body but sometimes l just feel like l am going backwards instead of forward. I have been off my work so long the thought of going back makes me feel sick although l know l am not ready at the moment to go back. My life has become a routine of not doing much and not seeing many people apart from my family. And l feel all l am hearing is how good they are all doing and how happy they are.
And here is me stuck at home most of time with no life.
If it was not for this forum and my close friend l have met through this forum infact a few friends l have made through this forum l would go off my head. I became friends with sarah at the start and we became really close and thank god for finding her and if course Cels , Renee, Rose and Kate and Graham and the rest of the crewe who l could sit and name but woud be here all day who all became like a second family as l spend most of my days reading and talking on here. I see a lot of people come and go and l think to myself is this because they are bettter and back to there normal life and l am still here getting know where. There is no sign of me leaving or going back to normal for a while. And now l am thinking l have hut a wall. Is it just me thats taking forever ti heal.
I tried to be normal and have a few days in York and thought it was quite an achivment driving 350 miles but it ended in disaster not just because of my legs but the hotel was just not gonna be comfotable enough for me to sleep as l have a set routine in sleeping at home. So l was going to be to tired to do anything and ended up home the next day.
Sorry guys just feeling a bit low today you don't realise how mentally draining it can get at times as well as painful.

I have spoken to the heart guy (ron Sharkey) here in Heysham - he says he is writing to the surgeon today to say all ok to go ahead with operation ( having old hip taking out and new one putting as as it has worn out after 13 years) They will put me on beta blockers to deal with the AF I have. All good to go. I have an appointment so see Mr Maguire on 9th June, so hopefully my op will be soon after this date. Hope your'e all doing well.

A question for people who have had both hips done.
When I had my operation 3 weeks ago the surgeon told me he would put me in his diary to get the other one done in 12 weeks, I rang the hospital this morning to find out if I had a date and his P.A told me I'm not on any of his lists or in his diary, he said he is booked up for 6 months and I probably won't get my 2nd operation until Oct / Nov time! I'm absolutely gutted ! I got cancelled 5 times before I finally got my first operation and was basically on the ""wait list"" for a year. I didn't realise you go right back down to the bottom of the ""wait list"" for 2nd hip op.

"Hi all:
This may be a silly question but I'm a 63 year old woman 3 1/2 weeks post op from a total hip replacement, anterior approach in the US. My pain was not very great at all until I started physical therapy exercises. I have been doing them very slowly and when I feel pain, I stop. So, in other words, I haven't overdone it with exercise.
This morning I have pain emanating from my operated hip. This has me concerned. Is it normal to have pain similar to what you had before surgery?
Also, when does the leg numbness from surgery go away? My thigh is still numb and what isn't numb is very tender and sore.
Anybody experience these things?
Thanks so much in advance.

"Today I met with my doctor to discuss the game plan for my surgery on Wednesday May 11th. He showed me the fracture bone of right side of top portion of the stem suggesting that he will do the following: replace the stem, and attach a lateral temporary plate to the fracture side. Now here is the tricky part; the shell, liner and socket are in good shape. Since he is going in, should he replace the entire top components with new updated version despite they are in good shape? Or just leave them the way they are and take the risk of having another surgery down the road which potentially might take place since theese components are 19 years old. He is undecided and he want my permission to replace the healthy old top part of the prosthesis.
The question is; wouldn't be wise to replace everything with up to date version of cup, shell, and liner? Or keep them and take the risk for a near future surgery?
your thoughts will definitely help

"So since my surgery I have been trying to go back to college as i have exams at the end of the month. My college told me they wouldnt even let me come toclass or on the premisses unless I was in a wheelchair. Iv been on the government website and apparently that is against the law. I have now got a wheelchair so that isnt the main problem.
The main problem is I need a room to myself as sitting for more than 10 minutes leaves me in agony that sometimes does reduce me to tears, so having my own room means i can stand up and shake the pains of when needed, also along with shaking of the bum pains from sitting and stiffness from surgery. College will not do this unless I have a letter frommy GPs or surgen. Well my GPs are addament they will not write me a letter as they dont do these types of letter anyone, but they did say they may write me a letter to confirm to college theydont write letters. My surgeons secutery said they can only write me a letter if the college write to them first with my signature on it to, which seems simple enough right? wrong, college are refusing to write me that letter and say I have to obtain it myself when its clear i cannot.
Now the main question is, is this discriminating to my current disabilties and because of recovering from surgery.
Anyone work in a college or school and have any ideas on this? Ill add im from the UK as each country has its own laws and legislations and so on

"My LTHR has been planned for end of May. However I just received a letter from my spine surgeon (I have had disc problems: a decompression and a fusion in the last 10 months, and an exploratory nerve root block injection last week) I quote from his letter: ' ... it [the outcome from the injection] does suggest slightly that some of your [left leg] pain does come from the nerve root. I think, however, that there are definite features of pain from your left hip and the appearances of the X-Ray's would support the fact that the hip is symptomatic ...'.
What is he saying? Is he saying that the pains down my left leg are partially due the spine but more due to the hip? Will the LTHR go ahead?
I have pains on the left side - on the groin, upper thigh on the left side, left of the base of the knee, from the central base of the knee down (centrally) towards the foot and at the left of the ankle. The pains are around 6/10, but after walking a few meters I slow down and it's an effort to continue walking.
What would be of great help is to hear which areas on the LEG did established hippies have pains before THR, and if post THR these pains disappeared.
Would really appreciate hearing about your own experiences. Thanks very much, Harry.

"My surgery is coming up fast, now - two weeks, tomorrow, and I have some questions that I hope the Forum can answer:
I have arranged transportation to the Clinic and need to be ready to travel by 10:30 a.m., for admission at 12:30 p.m. Surgery scheduled for 5:30 p.m.
It will be a long day, and I am assuming that I will be kept pretty busy with pre op preparations, meetings with the anaesthetist, and all other interested bods.  By 5:30 p.m., I shall be pretty whacked out, unless there is an opportunity for a snooze.
When I visited the Clinic for my pre op, the climate control caused me to feel dehydrated and my face flushed up almost immediately.  I am extremley fair skinned, and this is going to be a real problem for me.  The dehydration will be very uncomfortable, and I know that I shall not be permitted to drink so much as a glass of water, several hours before surgery.  I understand why this is, so no problem, just a temporary discomfort.   Fortunately, there are windows that open and can help with the uncomfortable flushing.
We are catheterized until we make it to the loo independently,  I drink a lot of water and cranberry juice.  I am pretty sure that they will want to ration my fluid intake, as they will not want bags filling up too rapidly and overflowing!  I want to take two or three bottles of water in with me, along with some cranberry juice.  Is this permitted, or is it down to the individual clinic/hospital's guidelines?
Following surgery, I understand that I shall be back in my room at around 10:00 p.m.  I believe that I read somewhere, that a good night's sleep is out of the question as the nurses will constantly be waking me up to take blood pressure readings, etc.  Is this actually what happens, and approximately how many times during the course of the night is this done? 
Given that I may well be exhausted the day after surgery, due to the surgery itself and the monitoring, they will be wanting to get me up and mobilized.  The sooner the better, but it will be an ordeal, if I am already tired from an interrupted night.  Will I be given an opportunity to sleep during the day? 
I want to take a Kindle and my computer in with me, as I am hoping that I will be well enough, at some point, to either read a Kindle book, if there is one that I can access that is sufficiently challenging and interesting.  Otherwise, I am thinking that a good couple of movies or the l967 edition of the Forsyte Saga, will keep me occupied.  Not sure that I will be well enough though, as i am not sure what to expect.  There is no point carrying a lot of equipment to keep me entertained, if I am in no condition to appreciate any of it.
Reading other posts, it seems that post op condtion can vary enormously from one person to the next, but I am wondering what the mid line experience, is post op? 
First time up, I understand is using a walker. How many times during the day following surgery do they usually get you up and about?  What is the usual procedure on Day 2 and Day 3?  Day 4 is supposedly the day one is ""let out,"" providing the surgeon is satisfied with progress, etc.
A lot of questions for the Forum, but it is as well to be as well prepared, as possible, recognising that there a variations from person to person and clinic/hospital practises, as well.
I have resumed my physio excerises after an hiatus created by the shock of the RBBB finding and the echo, that had me in a state of shock for a month.  So, with any luck, they will help post op as I am trying to stretch the muscles that have atrophied because of the OA, and build more upper body strength with push ups, etc.
Some feedback would be very much appreciated, although know that some of my questions may be unasnwerable.

I have been on two courses of antibiotics with no positive results so accept the fact that it is not infected which was my first worry.
However, it's still painful.  I saw my physio last week and told him about it. When he looked he said he thought I was going to show him something the size of a pea, but agreed that it was big.  He said he hadn't seen anything like it before.  He has advised me to keep going back to the doctors because as a post-op patient I am still 'in the system' and if a need a referral it will happen more quickly.  He says my hip is fine - I have a good range of movement and he has advised me to treat the hip replacement and the lump as two separate issues.
I am very worried about it and I wonder if anyone else has had anything similar.  I am also worried that no-one is taking it seriously.
I will keep going back to the doctors and saying how concerned I am until someone does something about it.

"just thought i would contribute how things were when i started nursing 35 + years ago .i remember being a student nurse on an orthopaedic ward - hip replacement patients spent 10 days minimum  flat on their backs in bed with a large triangle of foam called a charnley  wedge between them. You had to be rolled in that position to go on a bed pan , have sheets changed etc . You were utterly dependent on nursing staff for eveything , plus no tv in hospital other than the day room which you couldnt get to . Hospital food ( yuk) , very limited visiting hours . Plus a catheter for 10 days was standard . After the 10-14 days you got up for half an hour each am and pm and at about 3 weeks you went home . Its amazing how far everything has moved on since then , most of us are up the day of surgery , home in a few days etc etc im not saying we are lucky needing hip surgery but im very glad to be a patient now and not then !

"Hi im 7 weeks post op and generally feeling good. Tommorow I'm going to my caravan which is a touring caravan stored on a site on the East Coast Flamborough near Bridlington.
Now apart of me is quite excited to be getting back to normality but I'm worried about everything from falling to travelling in a car for 2 hours , not being comfy in my bed or sat on the seating area that it's driving me mad. Does this operation/experience turn people into worrying about everything. I used to be care free.
Im going with my partner and i won't be getting involved in any setting up of the van and won't be driving and everything is on 1 level. So why am I so scared to leave the comfort of my own house. I think I've become institutionalised in my home and I am starting to panic. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

"I was researching the topic of lower back pain post THR. It concluded that the Hip made the back hurt or the back was making the Hip hurt. >>>?????
They haven't figured that out. Then, they added ""of course the hip bone is connected to the back bone and the leg bone is attached to the knee bone"" 
In this document, they go step by step through the anterior approach, and these 2 images showed up. While your leg is unhinged or whatever they push it back under the good leg to get in the incision better... Then, what's up with the slanting? It is a way to ""facilitate the femur"" something or adjusts the length.... So... Seriously, I'm laying there with my legs wide open?

BUT -  I've been reading about Bisphosphonates - a class of drugs that prevent the loss of bone mass, used to treat osteoporosis and similar diseases. Brand names for oral medications include Fosamax and Boniva. There is even a once a year injection called Aclasta.
Has anyone here taken any of these and had some success?

Allow time,allow the emotional stuff that seems to come from nowhere and dont compare yourself.We you need love and understanding - come HERE.Sometimes they are the ONLY ones who can ""get it""!  Im fighting a battle! Any of you who read this send me love and light-prayers and your lovely energy please! Thank You!. Had my5 12 week check up last Tues 4/26.Dr said I could drive! Said I need therapy-hydrotherapy. Says maybe I can go back to work ease in about 2 weeks after I start therapy. He says my gait is off and im unsteady with the cane.I have a terrible limp. Says I have the 90 degree angle. restriction in place,Fine Great! THEN I cant get into hydrotherapy -they dont take my insurance,my Dr says he cant help with the authorization of it AND its the only place around 70 miles that does the hydrotherapy. So far lost all last week trying to get in. THEN faxed the paper over to work about that I can come back around the ninth w restrictions and work says NO. Cant come back with restrictions! So now no money no income no therapy. I started applyin for social security dissability-but here it takes 3-5 mos to be denied the 1st time,can be denied up to 3 times. AND the lady at the SSD office said that according to the ADA (american dissability act) my work ""has to"" at least look into ""reasonable accomodation"" BUT I work in Activitys in a nursing home -as my job title implies -its an active moving job and I have to move furnitue and move people all day for activitys that runs from taking care of baby chicks to gardening and setting up for happy hour patys etc. plus I teach exercise and do aromatherapyand meditation ...I LOVE my job,BUT Im quite sure there are no ""reasonable accomodations"" for them to get for me other then expecting the cna""s or other people to do the set up the clean up and get the people, NOT going to happen. SO I DONT want to ""go after"" my job for a dissability discrimination act, Im not even yet declared disabled. SO STUCK, cant go back to work,will definately have at least the 90 degree angle restriction for 3 mos ( Im at 6 weeks 3 days),no $$, no income,no therapy- more fighting insurance today. Im scared.My friends -who I KNOW love me cant bear to see me in such a way-they  stay away now pretty much cuz they dont know what to do.The platitudes are worse anyway, ""OH ITS NICE to be OFF WORK-JUST ENJOY IT. and I think yea in 2 months, when Im living in my car I ll try to remember that! I do have a laugh with it at least a couple times a day. I can say I dont let it stop me-I keep walking everday for now cane, sometimes walker still just keep walking for now! THEN my top denture broke! OMG can you believe it! 1200 to get a new one a quarter of that to fix them hahaha! What the heck can one do BUT laugh at this-laugh like a crazy person! Well, just wanted to check in,ask for your loving good energy-share some of your crazy,"" I cant believe this is happening"" stories, and ideas on how to survive?

"I am 2+ weeks pre-op and have been devouring the comments in this forum! Thank you so much for your insight, your humour, your advice and your support. This is my first post.
I am a 57-year-old married female and am having a THR on the right side on May 3rd. I have a team of women helping me prepare: my personal trainer is an acute care nurse, my holistic chiropractor uses various techniques to get my glutes firing again and my massage therapist beats on my tight muscles weekly.
I am trying to get as strong as possible before my surgery. I have two canes, a toilet seat booster, a walking frame, a grabber, a 3"" seat wedge, ice gel packs, frozen food and a friend coming to stay with me for two weeks after my surgery. I also have a bell to ring when I need help. (My husband's idea. lol)
I am going to a small, specialty hospital here in Toronto. It is an older hospital with a great reputation for post-op care. All they do are hips, knees and other arthritis surgeries. I've already spent at least 30 minutes with my surgeon and really like her straightforward style.
I am just wondering what words of wisdom you might have for me before my surgery. Anything you care to share might be helpful. Thank you so much!

"Finally, I have my surgery date.  It is scheduled for May 17 - two weeks from Tuesday.  Suddenly, I am having to really kick myself itno action after weeks of inaction and being in a state of limbo.
Transportation has been organised, food has been ordered, a two week supply from the kitchen that Rose recommended.  They are very good, Rose!  In fact, I only have three meals of my original order left, that was supposed to be for my original surgery date, earlier this month.  Furniture still needs to be modified to meet with the recommendations of the Occupational Therapy guidelines.  Difficult because it is all antique, so has to handled with care, and some of the legs are difficult shapes to manage.
My overriding concern is that I am to be ready for transportation by 10:30 a..m., and check in at 12:30 p.m.  Surgery is scheduled for 5:30 p.m., and with two surgeries ahead of me.  I am assuming they are both being performed by my surgeon, but I may be wrong. 
My worry is that with approximately three hours of surgery behind him, he is likely to be tired, although, of course, he has his support team.  Mistakes can be made when fatigued but, he is a professional, knows what he is doing, and is reportedly, one of the best in the country. I am wondering what the Forum's feedback on this would be, or am I worrying for no reason, now that it is all finally happening, and really fast, now. 
Is it possible that the reason for three surgeries in one afternoon including mine, have been caused by the 48 hour walk outs by the junior doctors, and now the consutants who were having to take over from them, cancelling all elective surgeries, thousands of them, has created a ""bunching up"" of my type of surgery?
Two weeks is going to go by in a flash, after the Bank Holiday is over!  Am I being unnecessarily concerned?

"Just wondering if anyone else has suffered a femoral fracture during surgery and how this has affected their recovery. I had THR 9 weeks tomorrow and I am still walking with 2 crutches although manage with only 1 around the house. I'm 47 and slim and was pretty fit before the operation as, even though I couldn't walk easily I swam a lot.
Being non-weight bearing for 6 weeks has meant recovery has been slow but, now that I can get on with the physio exercises I am finding it quite difficult and get quite a bit of pain around the hip. The fracture was wired up during the operation but I've been told to be very careful for 12 weeks and not push against gravity. My muscles are so weak and trying to do ""the clam"" exercise is almost impossible... I have been doing quite a bit of hydrotherapy but am frustrated by my slow progress...
Been swimming for the first time since the op which was ok but lots of clicking in the hip and my swollen knee didn't like it much.
Any advice welcome!

We got ready and went out for dinner and planned just to go to a local place in york we had been before. That was fine we got back to the hotel room and l could feel my back starting to get sore and my legs.
We just went to bed but l woke at midnight in agony. Usually at home l would get up and move to my couch and get back to sleep. So l tried to move onto the couch that was in the room and l had taken my comfort blanket l use at home. Never slept another wink tears happened as l new inside l was not gonna manage 4 days of this. My husband woke at 5 with me crying he said you are not liking this are you do you want to go home. I said yes for a start there was a lot of noise outside our room as we were on the ground floor. The room we had smelled of urine and the curtains had loads of small holes like moths had been eating them.
We have used this chain of hotels before and been really pleased with it but this hotel was older and seemed to need refurnushed and updated.
So l am home. I feel better and more comfortable.
So l feel like l am not ready for holidays yet maybe a bit to quick after 2 hip replacement.
I will also be calling the hotel chains customer service to see if l can get a refund as we were disapointed with the room.

"5 weeks post op today and my operated hip feels great. If my left hip wasn't so bad I would be walking unaided and off all pain meds. The surgeon wants to wait 3 months to schedule my left hip so I'm not able to enjoy my new hip completely but I am in half as much pain as I was.
I just get lonely during the day. I list my job 7 months ago and have been sitting at home alone all day and I don't have a car.
My daughters get home from school at 3 and my girlfriend at 5:30 but usually has things going on after work like tonight she has choir practice and wont be home until 9:30 and play rehearsal other nights.
Now I have to figure out what I want to do for a living after recovering from my second surgery. The surgery will be at least 4 months from now so I have time. My car needs a new transmission so I'm also considering fixing it and giving it to my oldest daughter , (she'll get her license in a couple weeks) and bying something else for me. In the mean time it's more hanging around the house all day talking to my daughters pet guinea pigs.

"When I'm not helping son with his books and papers for his graduate work, I've been searching for anecdotal evidence on the success rate of this procedure for AVN. 
What i've found is surgeons often find more damage than the MRI shows, which means the procedure has less chance of being effective. It takes 2 hours for the procedure versus 45 minutes to an hour for THR. Many surgeons refuse to do it. Being pain free can last as little as one or two months or as long as five years, but the average time seems to be one year or 18 months before you need THR. 
I haven't told son yet about what I've found, but I'll have to. He is having a really rough time. He went to a meeting on campus and was already tired, but agreed to go to a gathering. He's going to come back exhausted.

"Went to my GPs yesterday to get my dressing removed, nurse says it is incredin=bly neat and clean. Obviously took a photo and was happy enough. I caught a look at it in a mirror and was so shocked to see how incredibly long it really is, the photo made it look a lot smaller, but im still happy haha.
Although the nurse didnt not seem to happy about how i had been treat on the hospital ward when i told her. We were sent home with no information on restrictions, what im suposed to do with the TED stockings or anything, if i buzzed for a nurse it would take atleast half an hour for them to turn up and then they would never come back if you asked them for something. My first night I felt very unsafe as a male patient in the next room was attacking nurses whick means my sleep was no exsitent that night. If you have a look at the photo below that is supposed to be a discharge note, they also got the date of my surgery wrong also. Its a pretty disgusting excuse of a discharge letter in my opinion.
On a lighter note yesterday i had a day out to the metro centre, being pushed around in a wheelchair by my mam, and today went to the galleries then another shop, again in a wheelchair.

"Hi all, currently 3 weeks after my TRHR (in australia)
Was in the hospital for 5 days before been transfered to a rehabilitation hospital for a 1wk 1/2. Here i had physio twice a day once in the morning and antoher in the afternoon. I must admit the physio was a great help but it made it harder having 2 young children at home watching them come and leave. It kind of got boring in the end.
Currently been home for 6 days, with the husband and 2 kids (4yrs and 1yr), been going  back to the hospital for some gym physio and some hydrotheropy phsio in the pool. They have found that am tending to walk the same way i did before the surgery as this is what i was used to, am just hoping that this isnt going to hold me back from making good use out of my new hip.

"Evening everyone
Thanks so much for all your messages of support.  This is the first time I've been on this site since my op on Friday 15 April 2016.
Anyway, all went well.  I had a spinal (they put me out first because I was scared of having a needle in my back).  I think I must have only been in theatre for just under 3 hours, because I went down at 1:45 pm and was being woken up in recovery at 4.45 pm.  I did think revision was going to be a lot longer, but it wasn't the case for me.  I was told that the hip resurfacing implant had to come out because the smaller part was wobbly and just moving about, hence all the pain I was in!  Plus there was some fluid that had to be sent to the labs for testing, hence I was put on antibiotics until the results came back (lucky clear).
I had to have a catheter on the Friday night because I had trouble trying to 'wee'!  They said they didn't want me to go more than eight hours and I was having so much difficulty (also having to use bedpans)!.
The staff were so lovely all the time I was in hospital.  A much better experience than my two previous hip operations, where the staff pretty much made me feel like I was a nuisance.  I do understand how short-staffed they were, but there was no need to be made to feel like rubbish when you feel rough after an operation.
I came out on Tuesday evening.  I really had trouble getting into the car at hospital then getting home, could hardly get out of the car, plus because I was having bladder problems, well, you can imagine!
All is progressing well and I am trying to exercise as much as possible, rest as much as possible, etc, and not to over-do things.  I feel quite well in myself.
One question I would like to ask is that the hospital gave me my discharge medication which will be running out in two days time, but on my paperwork, it says that the GP does not need to continue with a repeat prescripton for most of the meds.  I am on paracetamol, codeine phosphate and ibuprofen.  I phoned my doctor's today about a repeat prescription for these, but they say they won't be doing one because the hospital have not requested one.  Surely, you cannot just stop taking all the painkillers in one go once all the boxes are empty.  The doctor's receptionist said that I should see how I go after they run out and if that if I am in pain, to phone them for a prescription review. 
Obviously, I don't want to keep taking the meds but worry what the pain wihen they run out in two days time.  What do other people think and what is their experience on this?
Very best wishes to everyone and your continued recoveries. 
Lots of love and hugs from Pammyw.  xxx

"I have bilateral hip replacements in 1997. Two weeks ago I start experiencing pain top of left hip on movement. X-rays, MRI, bone scan and hip aspirations are all negative. My doctor scheduled a total hip revision in two weeks citing "" the implants lasted 19 years and we should revise all components. The stem is cemented and liner is plastic. I have also a history of gout and I wonder since all tests and images are negative, could it a hip gout pain?
Thank you

"i am 3 months post op. My question- how can you tell if there is a hip muscle tear? I tore my quad muscle tripping over a curb and had that repaired 2 weeks ago. But I am wondering if I also tore a muscle in my hip- lots of pain and can barely walk a block with pain medication and a trekking pole. Pain worse since trip; but limp not as bad as I have read here that others are suffering. 
MD tells me hip is hard to image as I also have hardware in my back. Any thoughts?

"Totally confused about the information I have been given by the same clinic.  One person has said RUH for Echo cardiogram and the other has said they wll take another ecg from my GP and compare!   Waiting time at the RUH is months!
Just over three weeks ago, I had an upper molar removed.  It was infected, and some 20 years ago had a very badly executed root canal that left a gap between the cap and my gum where the infection set in. The dentist did not give me any antibiotics and said the infection would drain,  As the tooth was being removed, I felt my heart ""jolt"" and as I got out of the chair, I was quite wobbly for a while. 
Not sure what any of this means, other than the infection would have moved around my body, and possibly had an effect on my heart.  An ecg taken in December last year, was normal!
Not at all sure about the scheduled surgery now, as everything is up in the air, and I can't get hold of anyone in the pre admission clinic.  
I am scheduled for a further ecg with my medical practice for tomorrow, but am not sure whether the clinic will accept this or not, and that is what I am trying to clarify with the clinic as they have given me conflicting information.  
This is all driving me absolutlely mad!!!

"I have never been so excited in my whole life. I am a 60 year old runner and have been completely up front with my Dr & PT that I will run again.
My PT has told me that he has never seen recovery like this and how quickly it has happened. I have complete range of motion and am absolutely pain free with no hip or leg rerstriction.
I work in the running industry and was told I would be out of work 4-6 weeks. Well I have been cleared to work but with no lifting or deep bending. I am riding a bike and doing stretching without any difficulity. ZI am a hard worker who does not take no for an answer but I do listen closely to my body. 
I am NOT going to run until a full 60 days is up in order for a complete healing of the joint and stem. I'm motivated but not stupid but I also know what I can do.
My advice to everyone and I know everyone is different but keep that hip moving and do the exercises and walk walk walk and get off those damm meds. Its always been my belief that the meds are only a band aide when it comes with pain. I dealt with it and it was soon over. For me I had zero pain meds after the first day. I like dealing with reality.
Be POSITIVE and yes listen to your doctor but more so listen to your body. Get out there and do exactly what you did prior to your hip replacement. 
I wish everyone all my best,
Billy

From my reading I want to go with what I have booked as seems a less risky option even if it takes longer to recover.

This will be a big test for me as its the most l have done since my 2 hip replacements.
I am excited and nervous at the same time but as my husband said there is no pressure on me, we do what you feel you can and if you are not managing we will come home.
I want to do it l want to prove to myself l am a million times better than l was the last time l went which was a disaster . it was when l had OA pain and it seemed to get a million times worse when l arrived there. I basically spent 3 days in a hotel room in tears if l tried to go anywhere l could hardly walk. That was end of sept last yesr and l had my 1st hip replacement 9th dec.
So we will see how it goes this time. Hopefully better than last. I will be able to say l actually seen York.
I have wi fi in my hotel so will try and keep you posted on how l am getting on.
This is huge for me and l am hoping it is great.

"Hi lovely people,
can I ask if anyone has purchased a memory foam cushion to sit on and did it help?
i am 51 and have severe OA in Left hip, the right hip is rapidly catching up!  Not to be left out!  I have seen the Consultant and will be having a LTHR in about 6 weeks. 
Once I get going I can walk reasonably well, 2-4 miles with the dog. Standing is fine, BUT sitting is a complete pain in the you know what!  Both hips hurt when sitting but obviously I can't stand or walk ALL the time. 
I work as an Ocuupational Therapist. In fact my first ever job was Orthopaedics and teaching hip precautions! I work in the Community and have to drive fairly long distances. Yes my colleagues are taking the Micky and there are a lot of jokes about raised toilet seats!  I do have to spend a large amount of time in the office and have to stand and pace about regularly. 
Back to the cushion, any advice would be truly welcomed.

"Just got home from the hospital after my check up.  Was sent for Xrays first, one lying flat and one with knee bent and turned outwards. Replacement is right where it should be.  Consultant said I was walking well and tried to take away my crutch, but I said I needed it to poke people in the supermarket who came too near with their trolleys.  The 'infection' is a mystery.  Consultant poked and prodded me and said there is no infection there now.  He asked me what made me think I had an infection and I described the pain, the redness and that it felt hot and he just said ""Hmmmm"", difficult to say without seeing it at the time"".  Told me yto finish off the course of antibiotics anyway.  He think the lump/fluid is a haematoma and should disperse.  I forget when he said he wanted to see me again - it was either 3 months ot 6 months.

"Some time ago I asked for advice from those who had done long haul flights following a hip replacement. I'm delighted to say I am just back from a trip to vist my son and daughter-in-law in Rio de Janeiro. Thanks for all your helpful advice. 
Here are my comments for what they are worth:
When booking your flight hesitate  to admit you need help . If like me you can walk reasonably but can't manage long waits in queues, ask for wheelchair assistance.
Take a crutch with you even if you no longer use it at home. 
The rest of  your group - in my case my daughter and my husband -  will  also get priority treatment in queues etc.
We saw a child asking ""Mum why do I have to sit in a wheelchair? An honest response might be ""So dad and me and your brothers and sisters can get better treatment at check-in,"" Some people cheat the system.
The staff pushing my wheelchair, particularly at the start and finish (Manchester and Rio) were friendly and helpful. It was only at Paris  Charles de Gaul airport that we were left unattended for some time and with no information about when or where we would b e taken.

"Hi All,
I am due to have a LTHR on May 11.  Just looking for a support group to joing because I'm sure I will have post-op issues that are being or have been discussed here.  
I do struggle with anxiety in certain situations and I am concerned about waking up intubated (hope I don't have to), the compression hose (getting them on and off and just the restrictive nature of them), and the risk of being on blood thinners for a month (although I prefer that risk over not taking blood thinners and having a higher risk for blood clots).
I am 47 and have had hip issues since I was in high school - though never diagnosed until two years ago, I had a femoral acetabular impingement that, with diagnosis, could have been repaired years ago and I wouldn't be in this situation now, more than likely.  So, I'm frustrated that this has to happen now but the impingement has caused arthritis, which is now end stage bone on bone so I need to get this done to lessen my pain and increase my mobility.
Looking forward to a quick recovery with no complications and to getting to know some of you!
Thanks for letting me ramble!

Just a little update. I go back for more hydrotherapy in a couple of weeks I still can not put my right foot flat on the floor. I am still using 2 crutches when out and about. I am so unfit that I am struggling to walk more than  500 meters and have to sit down to get my breath back but I am working on excersizes at home to help with this too. Celabrated 25th wedding aniversary a couple of weeks back. Lost my dad 14th March never got to see him.All I was looking for was some remorse from him for the abuse he put me through as a child. Wont get that now will I?
Other than the above I am doing pretty well. I can walk in the house without my sticks but can't stand straight I guess that will come with time.
Started doing a little gardening like pruning the hedges and trees that havn't been done for over 4 year wow what a mess the garden is in. Got myself some fruit bushes. A cherry tree some strawbeerry plants and a rasberry and blackcurrant bushes and some Fusha plants that also produce edible fruit. Any fruit I don't need will be frozen till the winter and fed to the birds. I make them fruit cake instead of just feeding bread. There is no nutrition for them in bread. Fruit cake is the best.

"Hi!
I am 46 yrs old and had a THR a week ago.   Up until then, I was very active (even taking a spinning class the day before surgery).    I exercised every day (cycling made my hip feel good).  THR was needed because my hip would just give out on me without warning.  I would go from no pain to excruciating pain within steps.  
My doctor said  I would most likely have a quick recovery and he doubted I would even need a cane by 2 weeks post op.  I am off of all pain meds but Tylenol.    However, I'm now having severe knee pain on the leg that had the surgery.   Almost like the knee cap is misaligned.    This just popped up in the last day or so.    
Has anyone else had this?     Any ideas or remedies?

"Hi 
Has anyone heard anything about not take anti-inflammitory's post op.  I have been on tramadol and paracetamol, the other day I had a bad day and took an ibuprofen and it worked wonders, by chance I spoke to my doctor on the same day about my meds and mentioned that I had taken Ibuprofen and she asked if the hospital had said I could take them, I said they had been giving them to me for the 4 days I was in there so thought the odd one would be ok, she didn't say not to take them but said some hospitals don't like us taking anti-infammatory's.  Previous to having the op I took Diclafenic as the Ibuprofen made me a bit weezy, but I am ok with the odd one.
I am cutting down the tramadol so getting ready for the side effects of that. I am now 3 weeks post op.  But would like to know if anyone else had come across this, please.

It is speculated that he'd had or needed THR, & from reading a lot in this forum, as well as helping my own son in his own journey of recovery, there is a lot of pain, painkillers, & dealing with it.

my main concerns are that since the op my left leg now seems to be longer and from the knee down myleg bends of at an angle which is not exactly normal. Im not sure if its just because my legs arent right atm or if its something i should be worried about.
On Monday im getting the dressing and everything taken of my incision so im very excited to see it in all its glory, and as you can see it looks like its going to be pretty impressive, im surprised about the lack of bruising though as i usually bruise badly over the littlest of things haha

So it is still wet from time to time, red in comparison to the rest of the incision & a bit swollen. But the surgeon says it is not infected & not a cause for alarm. I wonder if he would think the same way if he were the patient? I suggest you don't google it - unsavory photos.
He got an xray of both hips and both legs are the same length. Son asked about an MRI of both hips because of AVN & surgeon said that is usually done at the first ortho appointment - fail by that surgeon!

So ,hips settling as expected but I have a strained quadracep - maybe from surgery or after :-( first disappointment , but explains thigh and knee pain .
He ll make another referal for physio , which will hopefully be quicker than drs referal ? He also confirmed my recovery will be longer due to my back problems and also due to having deep hip sockets ??
Deep hip sockets he said is the reason for my problems and he also confirmed I will need other hip replaced sooner or later ,stating best to be soon whilst fairly youn . - Second disapointment ...i have no idea what deep hip sockets means ,causes or anything ???
So told to continue meds and use crutches and I shall see him again in 4 months ,then every year . He said to aim to be using one crutch by m . 4 month visit - seems ages to me to be using still ??
Regarding driving he said I have to call insurance to get them to confirm I can drive -restrictions he said to follow precautions for the next year due to possibillity of dislocation . Any problems before then not to hesitate to contact them .

"I've asked the question and waiting to hear from the surgeons (not likely to hear until next week).
My layman's thinking is this:
If the spine injection doesn't get rid of at least some of the leg pains then it must be the hip that's causing (at least most of the) the leg pains. The spine injection makes sense in this scenario.
But if the spine injection does get rid of some or all of the pain, and then I have the LTHR (which I def am going to) then what is the point of having the spine injection? How will the outcome from the spine injection help the hip surgeon in this scenario?
My left hip deterioration is significantly advanced.
Has anyone been in this situation? Be interested to hear your views. Cheers, Harry

"I'm 9 weeks tomorrow and feel great.
I have just been for my walk, a little longer than yesterday, did 5.7 mile in glorious sunshine and part of it up the fields and I did it without using my stick, whoooo. Still took it with me, because I only did about a quarter without my stick yesterday. I had a few rests on a grit bin and some rocks, my dog went for a couple of dips in the beck. I'm still on precautions, so I keep him on his extending lead and carry a long handled poop scoop, no bending.

I'm now 11 weeks post op and doing well but I still have pain in my shin and ankle. Is this normal? It can become very painful if I'm walking for any length of time (more than half an hour). I am due to go back to work in just over a weeks time and just wanted to check that this is still a part of recovery.

"Hello everyone. I am a 63 yo female who has suffered from severe arthritis of the L hip for years. Finally couldn't tolerate the pain any longer and
had Anterior THR last Friday. I was doing great.
Yesterday (5 days PO) I could walk well with no pain and without assistance of walker, crutches etc. Also, didn't need pain meds.
I had my first PT home session yesterday which changed that. After the PT left, my leg began to really hurt. I iced it but didn't do any good.
Today pain is still there and my L knee has begun to hurt as well.
So frustrated. Is this normal? Should I stop PT for a while or keep going?
Anyone have a similar experience?
Thanks,
Bev

"what if the stiffness, soreness, pain in muscles are not post THR related ?
well, they are and they are not, I think ..
I am 12 months post--op from R THR and 6 months from L THR and not doing all that great - 
At last visit with surgeon I mentioned pain in old new hip (right) and was told I have tronchanteric bursitis - 
I did the exercises I was supposed to do , upped the pain medication, saw another physical therapist who gave me TENS treatment and dry needling ( relax the knots in muscle through needling) - 
At first it felt good - well, better - but then, after the 2nd , the 3rd treatment, I could barely move - Walked unbalanced (yes, took my trusted rollator with me again after so many months) - and felt sick -
Then I had a rant here about the stomach protector medicine Omezaprol and the side effects - So I stopped taking it - the side effects include all the ""symptoms"" I have been suffering from for a long time - including muscle ache, blurred vision, fuzzy head, nausea an much more
Then I had a closer look at Celebrex, the OA medication for pain, prescribed by surgeon pre- and post-op and taking for forever ...
(I remember that this medication was taken off the market in USA or am I wrong ?  Doc told me I was wrong)
Wow --- amongst many things, rapid weight gain was amongst them -
So I stopped .... cold turkey - 
Then I got really sick - Acid reflux (never had that before in my life), chilled to the bones (thought it was the hardware), haedache - and muscle ache - couldn't keep food down or even water ...
Got out of bed a couple of times to be here on the forum, but didn;t last long - 
Then it dawned on me .. I had this before - withdrawal symptoms at that time from a heavy antipsychotic drug - 
Right now I am riding it out - 
thanks for listening 
big warm hug

"Hi all,
I'm new to this forum and definitely wish I'd found it sooner as everyone is so open and honest and eager to give advice.  Basically, since I was 22 years old I have had ongoing issues with my right knee and lower back, but despite numerous x-rays, MRI's, physio etc. no one could pinpoint the problem.  4 years ago, after running a marathon, it was found that both my hips had severe OA with right significantly more progressed.  I was told at that time I needed a THR.  I put it off as the pain wasn't that bad and I seemed to manage on paracetamol, anti-inflammatory and regular appointments to get beaten up by the remedial masseur and the chiropractor. Anyway, towards the end of last year I noticed that the right hip was beginning to feel restricted when walking, the pain increased and I was struggling to keep up with my daughter.  Lately I can稚 walk more than a few minutes without significant pain and probably half a mile tops before I need to give up.  I've always been a sporty active person and I'm determined not to be limited by this condition so I got referred back to the orthopedic surgeon who took one look at the x-rays and told me the right hip needs done now and the left one isn't far behind it!  I'm not completely debilitated by the pain, however from what I read it would seem that I'm not doing myself many favors delaying any longer and that the recovery should be better when I am still relatively fit and the muscles have not wasted too much.
My surgery is scheduled for the 4th of May. Yikes!
I still find it very daunting because in my head I keep telling myself that I'm only 40 and I should be putting it off until I really really can稚 take anymore. Also, the idea of needing a revision in 15-20 years time is not a good one.  However, I just kind of feel I need to live life now when I am still active and that I need to do this for my daughter so that she has a dad that can run around and play with her. I'm also keen to get back to my activities without the pain and restrictions that I currently have. I値l deal with the revision if and when it comes around.  So I have been concentrating on getting my head in the right place, planning things around the house for my recovery, reading everything I can, and generally dementing everyone and anyone with talking about it!
Thank you for all the posts, they have provided me with reassurance that I'm making the right decision and that there is light at the end of the tunnel!

"Hi,  I received THR on my right hip last Thursday and everything went well and I feel great (It's only been 4 days and I can already walk unassisted (although I'm using crutches or a walker to prevent compensating or developing a limp).  The one probably is that the new right leg is significantly longer than the old leg.  Standing on my right, my left heel is probably close to 2 cms off the ground, sitting is even more pronounced and when I sit on a straight back chair, my right knee is probably 3 cms further than my left knee.  My left hip was resurfaced 7 months ago.
It's only been 4 days and I'm still in full recovery so I haven't felt any symptoms but I'm very concerned about long term hip, back, knee, etc pain so I'd like to know what my options are.  I do not want to get a heel lift (I spend most of my leisure time barefoot and don't wish to change that) so as far as I know, surgery is my only option.  I'm not actually against getting re-operated (although I don't want to get THR on the left which as the resurfacing so I'd want to get the right one re-operated) but I wanted to make sure there were no other options.
Let me know. Thanks,
Mike

Anyway just been had it all done, bloods, ECG, blood pressure. MRSA tests back from last - all good. Spoke to the anesthetist and I will be having a spinal plus general. Asked how long will I be in hopsital - because its a longer recovery time, its normally around 3 days. however they say it may be 5 - 7 days, all depends on how you do afterwards!. Can't say if I will be full weight bearing - this again will only b efound out once Mr Maguire is in doing the operation! YIPEE!! bring it on.

"I am nine weeks post op. During the second week after my fully cemented TLHR I developed increased sensitivity to the top of my left foot. Sometimes, during the night, it becomes so hot I have to apply ice and I feel as if a nail is being driven between my big and second toe.
My GP told me that the nerve in question was coming from my low back. After examination, he concluded that there was no compression and it was likely that, during the surgery, the nerve became irritated. Hopefully it will settle down maybe it won't . He gave me a prescription for Gabapentin, which is prescribed for epilepsy.
I asked him when I would be able to bend down to pedicure; to put on my socks and lace my trainers. His reply ""NEVER""!
I am unsure as to whether I wish to take the medication prescribed but surely once I reach the twelve week landmark I shall be able to bend?
I feel so low. I have conformed, whilst on my own,to all the rules and this news has completely slayed me.
I am due to have my right hip replaced in September and prior to this morning, I was feeling pragmatic, but now I am having trepidations.
There is so much conflicting advice.
Please can those post twelve weeks advise me of their capabilities?
If this nerve disruption is permanent, then that I can live with. But to think that I can never bend again has reduced me to tears.
I had the posterial approach.

There is lots  of help available on this site its great, you people on here are so helpful, but nothing (or I havent come across any!) on having it done a second time! I have lots of questions - like is the recovery longer etc. I know the risks are much higher (clots,etc) would love to hear from the horses mouth as they say!

"I am nine weeks post op after fully cemented TLHR. Posterial approach.Two weeks post surgery I developed increased sensitivity within the top of my left foot. Sometimes, during the night, it becomes so hot, I have to ice it. As this sensation has now risen to my ankle, I made an appointment to see my GP.
My GP told me that the nerve in question was within my low back. After examination I was advised that there was no compression and that the nerve had probably been aggravated during surgery; it would either , in time , settle or remain as it is . He prescribed Gabapentin, a drug prescribed for epilepsy .
During the consultation , I asked him to confirm when, without fear of dislocation,I would be able to bend. His response ""NEVER""!
I am absolutely devastated. I have, whilst on my own, fully conformed with all the rules . If my foot remains extra sensitive, then so be it. But the thought of never being able to bend again has filled me with horror and reduced me to tears.
I thought I was almost there and now that expectation has been completely blown away.
Am I always going to be dependant upon my dressing aid?

"Hi
I was wondering if I could ask for some advice.
Four months ago I was told I needed a left hip replacement surgery. But the MRI also showed a bulging disc that was causing quite unbearable pain down my right leg. I was then advised to have the spine surgery (TLIF) before the hip replacement one.
So, three months ago I had the spine surgery, this got rid of the pre op calf pains on my right leg, which was great (although some back pain from surgery is still there - it comes and goes). But the pains from my left hip (4/10 - just about bearable) remain, and I am now being advised to have the hip replacement next month!
Has anyone had the same experience? Should I be having one major operation so soon after another one? Will I be able to take it at my age (69)? I am told I am in reasonably good health.
Would be grateful for your thoughts.
Thanks

"I wanted to post this as I have seen some posts on here on bladder weakness and I thought it was worth a discussion on its own.  I have had on retrospect a fairly textbook recovery from my posterior THR on 2nd Feb. I am 53 - female.  The only issue I have is that I have had a couple of ""accidents"" during the night.  These started after I got home from hospital and are getting more frequent (once a week). Everything else seems to be healing very well - no pain or swelling - so I don't understand it.  I am getting a bit distressed about it to be honest and have to wear a pad to bed just in case.  I didn't mention it to my surgeon at my 6 week check as he was in a bit of a hurry and I didn't think he would do anything about it anyway.  I am going to take it up with my GP as I don't want this to become a ""thing"". Anyone else with the same problem and will this resolve itself. I sure hope so.

This is called a ""girdlestone""  and most doctors haven't heard of it.  My surgeon has found that the fusion area has cracked and I am having pain again.  He has said to do another THR or he could just go in and plate the fusion to remove the pain.  My leg is 4 inches shorter than the other, and I cannot sit or walk properly.  I use a walker and power chair for long distances.  I am terrified to go back to surgery!  But the pain is getting worse.

"I don't know if anyone here is in the same boat as me, living alone and facing hip replacement.  If there is, my message to you is don't worry - it can be done.
I was very nervous about how I was going to manage when I was discharged from hospital.  I organised everything in my home to be just right, setting up a 'station' by my favourite chair with a basket containing all my necessaries (comb, mirror, pen, notepad,  tissues, moisturiser, hand cream, remote controls), trailing socket for easy access plug sockets for laptop, phone and hairdryer etc.  
I bought a mobility trolley with two shelves for anything I needed to move from room to room which I kept on the other side of my chair, and on it I keep my phone, book, grabber, long handled shoe horn, jug of water (with lid - very important!), glass, medication and specs.  It's also great for bringing meals and drinks through so I can eat in comfort.  
I asked a few friends if they would be on the end of the phone for me. They had in fact already offered but I wanted to be sure they really were happy to be 'on-call' in an emergency.  Of course my children are also there for me but both out at work all day and living further away than my friends.
The first night was scary I must admit but it was okay.  My trolley was next to the bed and safe and stable to trundle to the toilet and back.  My mobile phone was on it just in case, as were my painkillers if I needed them in the noght (which I did).  When that first night was over and I had managed to get myself up and into the living room nursing the first coffee of the morning I felt a huge sense of achievement.
Simple meals were easy.  I had stocked up on ready meals, soup etc, but found I was able to make egg on toast, cheese on toast, porridge and bacon sandwiches.
Each day my confidence increased and I found it easy to put a load of washing in, take it out with my grabber and hang it on an airer.  
A strip wash in the bathroom was easy - no need to rush it.  Washing my hair was easiest over the kitchen sink with a bowl of hot water on the draining board and a jug to pour water over my head.  I needed an extra towel to mop up the water I spilt on the floor -DANGER ZONE!
Living alone through this is both a blessing and a curse.  I have had to do things maybe a partner would have done for me and I'm sure that has helped with confidence, movement and strengthening muscles.  For instance, there had been no-one to help lift my leg into bed so I have been doing it and now I don't even give it a second thought,  I just lift it right into bed.  The flip side is there's always a ""but what if ???"" at the back of my mind when I try something new, but planning it in my head instead of charging in is the key here.
Things you will need help with:
TED stockings if you have them - impossible to put on alone for a couple of weeks.
Shopping - do it online or ask a friend.
Lifts - if you have appoinments to attend.
I'm sorry for the epistle.  I just wanted anyone who is facing this alone to know you don't have to be Superwoman or Superman.  It's all about planning, positivity and a few good friends.

By the time I saw the surgeon in 2013 I was on a walking stick etcetc.  He said when did i want the op?? I said last week.  He said i can do it in 2 weeks.  So in those two weeks I closed my dance studio ( I hadn't been able to teach for 4 months and getting up the stairs to the studio was just awful), sold my business and went off to have my hip done.  This time I KNEW what the pain was when my left hip started playing up so I headed off to my sports Dr and then my surgeon.  Together we were able to agree a date that fitted in.  This time I'm not on a walking stick, I taught dance up until last Tuesday.  I keep getting told you can't compare this operation with the first one, Don't compare your rehab this time with last time.  And while i do get that - its the other side - I've probably used the left muscles differently, I'm older etcetc.  I still think this one should be about the same and I should have an even better time since I know more.  What is other peoples experiences??  Are both sides widely different???

"Hello again, been a 2-3 weeks since I checked in here. 
Had my op on Jan 26th THR, left side posterior approach. Saw surgeon last week who was amazed at how well I walk, bent me around a lot and told me all restrictions are over. The weird thing I was surprised by is I am to have no more checks. I assumed there would be scheduled check ups on how well the hip is doing in a year, 5 years etc but apparently not!
I had it done in a private hospital (paid by NHS) and all he said was I was now being referred back to the NHS and that I wouldn't be checked in the future. Seems everyone else is though!?
Although I was never a 'runner' as such I did start getting into it this time last year so I asked him if I'd be able to run again and he said there's no problem with that. This is contrary to almost everything I have read online. I asked if it would hasten the need for revision and he basically told me to go out and live a full life and not worry about that as I could get hit by a bus tomorrow and it's best to live the best possible life and do all the things you want to do rather than worry about possibly needing a revision a bit sooner. Which is a great point but is anyone here running regularly? I don't want to do marathons but just ease myself up to 5K in time. Really don't want to kill my hip or undo all his great work though! Any running advice/experience post THR would be appreciated.
I've now built weights into my daily exercises which is helping stregthen the muscles quicker. Doing the physio in a pool 3 weeks ago was also really helpful. Think I have been really lucky compared to some people. My scar is great and I've not needed pain killers since I got home. For 2-3 weeks I have been sleeping in any position. I was such a mess prior to the op, worried about all the things that have actually been quite easy to cope with. I live alone and want to encourage anyone in the same boat not to worry, it's do-able.
I'll need the right hip done in the future and hope I won't be so freaked out next time.
Thanks again for all your support 6/7 weeks ago!

"According to my hip wizzard of a consultant I am also off the hook at 5 weeks.Whooooooooo!!!!!!
I didn't post earlier because my partner and I have been out celebrating and after a couple of wines I am squinting writing this, so apologieseles.
 So, yes, first THR on June 30th 15 and leftie on 12th feb 16. Oh it's been tough, hasn't it? Yes, it has. 
I never planned for rubbish hips, it was shhhocking, and so bl**dy painful. 
The Hip Wizzard said I am ""perfectly symetrical"" as he gazed at my neon x-ray. I have a matching, glowing pair of 'Trinity' cups and 'Metafix' stems. He said the what was left of the cartilage looked as if it had been scooped out with a melon baller (slightly nicer than the raggedy tattered mess in the first one). I am glad they are gone, I was crippled.
The restrictions were laid out - no impact sports, no running, no pivoting, no twisting, ever, never and neither that funny leggy uppy knee outy thingy.
At this point I explained that I was dismissed from work (children, small, 3-4 years, active job, pivoting, dancing, running, impact stuff) and was trying to claim my pension.
He then did something to nearly get himself a hug - he dictated a letter, there and then, that put the pensions crew firmly on the losing side.
I wanted to hug him, he's a genius but he's shorter than me, it might have got awkward.
I held his hand instead.He patted my arm and said ""You didn't smile when I first met you""
I tripped over my stick and we both smiled.
We agreed to a virtual interview  in My Clinical Outcomes to review my progress in 12 months and then I skipped off into the sunset.....well. no I didn't, I hobbled off because I had been sat for too long and my bum was numb.
Freedom calls.......

"Hi my friend's mother had a THR some weeks ago, and advised me of this forum. I had a bi lateral THR on 9th March, I came home on 14th March. So far I have not been able to sleep on my back in my own bed, thankfully we have another electronic bed I can use, as I was awake for over 24 hours. The pain is well, painful, I'm actually describing the pain as the feeling of being attacked by a great white shark! Anyway, embarrassed to admit I am rather tearful, and keep bursting into tears. Dare I ask if this is 'normal'?! 
Everyone keeps telling me to take a step at a time, day by day, but I really am struggling to see how I am going to walk without pain again! 
Sorry that sounds a bit doom n gloom!

"Hello everyone,
I am a year and a half post op from a Complete Hip Replacement on my left side. Everything is going great, I am back to dancing(what I love to do). I have great range of motion, hardly ever any pain. The doctors say everything looks great, I don't have to go back for another 5 years if everything stays the same.
The one question I have is whenever anyone asks me about my hip replacement, it is so emotionally hard for me to talk about that specific day that I had the surgery. I am already a year and a half out and I'm not sure why I still can't talk about it. Has this happened to anyone else?
Thank you for he help!

"Hi Everyone
Well I went for my 6 week check up and surgeon was very happy with my recovery.
I thanked him for his excellent work and for giving me back my life.
I then told him I had made a list of questions.
He said thats great shoot let me hear them.
He stopped me and said well first before we go through them I will say NO RESTRICTIONS I was like really WOW ok so i quickly went down my list anyway and he confirmed his No restrictions.
He said for me to listen to my pain threshold and my body.
He said If it hurts don't do it.
He said I am still healing so to ease back into my normal routine before surgery.
I mentioned to him about 90deg rule and he said its more like respect your new hip more than live by 90deg rule.
He did an xray and said it looked really good eveything is where it should be. Unless I have problems i will see him on anniversary Feb 2017. Woohoo. 
I can swim
I can dive
I can drive
I can fly
I can resume sex 
I can sleep on my stomach
All of the above are ok as long as it doesn't hurt if it hurts take it easy and I will.
SO there you are yes every surgeon and physio are different.
Looking forward to getting in the pool this weekend and slowly work my way back up to swimming 2-3kilometres every morning.
I am going to have a small drive over the weekend :-)
I will let you all know I go.
Here's to Happy Recovery's for everyone.

"Hello my fellow hippies! I had my 6 week check on Monday, my op was 23 Jan, left THR posterior approach. Short and sweet, no examination, just saw me walk into the room without my stick, and said that I could drive, relax restrictions and get on with normal living! My questions/fears were answered all in a seemingly positive manner. His only caution was that a replacement hip will always be more susceptible to dislocation than the original .All very liberating but also daunting! I am walking out now without my stick, though not huge distances, and getting back to more normal living but I am still very 'hip-aware' and I know I will need this wonderful forum for some time to come! A big achievement for me this week has been to put my sock on my left foot YAY!

"I have just had hip replacement surgery to my right hip I am 6 days post op and I am having difficulty sleeping on my back. I have been advised to sleep on my back with a pillow between my legs for 6 weeks. When I lay in this position I get terrible pain in my operated leg and I am constantly seeking a comfier position raising my leg with cushions but nothing seems to work. After a while my leg becomes irritated moving around all the time. I have never had trouble sleeping in the past but do prefer my side. If i do drop off I am woken with discomfort either in my back or leg. I am exhausted and even trying to nap through the day does not compensate for the sleep deprivation. I am taking codeine and paracetamol 4 times a day and was wondering whether sleeping tablets would help.

"Morning everyone
Just need a bit of advice really.  Someone at work has been unwell recently and this last couple of days, I have been suffering with a bit of a cough, cold and sore throat.  I'm really fed up and worried because I am usually quite healthy.  Trust it to be the week of the operation!  Anway, as my left hip revision operation is tomorrow (18th March), do I need to let the hospital know or turn up at my arranged time?  I'd be really grateful for a bit of advice. 
I finished work Tuesday, and Wednesday and today is annual leave, so I did well staying in work so long.  I wish I had left work a couple of weeks ago now because maybe I wouldn't have picked up this bug!!  I did mention to the person not to be round me because of having an operation soon (fell on deaf ears)!
Anyway, I also want to say how brilliant this site is and I think you are all wonderful people and doing so well with what you are all going through.  I wish this site had existed when I had my hip resurfacing operations back in 2005 and 2007.  At least now, I feel more prepared and more knowing about things and won't be afraid to speak up if I feel things aren't right!!!

"Whooooo, finished my last injection, feels so good, time to let some bruising go down.
Just a note for those with walking sticks, crutches, don't forget to adjust them for different shoes if they are a different height.  I used to with my own and for some reason never this time, possibly because my shoes are low but they did need moving a notch.  Explains why my back was a bit achy after two walks yesterday.  Was much better today.
Also brings it home to you for the disabled, when they have to walk the paths with dropped kerbs, some are ok where they have a flat bit at the top to walk on but when they are angled straight from the entrance it is difficult to keep your balance, to walk them.  I walk on the road when I come to them.
So be careful everyone.

Everynight l wake up at some point between 1am and 4am. I have to sit and watch tv or go on the forum until l am ready to sleep again.
I have been like this since my 1st thr in dec last year.
It does not bother me anymore but just wondered how many others were like this? I can never sleep a full night yet l will go back to sleep soon and sleep until about 10 am sometimes later depending on how long l am awake for.
Thats me starting to get tired again so l will now sleep again.

"I am nine weeks post op on Friday. Yesterday I had an extremely full day. My daughter took me to her health club in Windsor which was very grand ! There were no lanes so I used weights to strengthen my arms and to permit me to kick my legs and to cycle . To relax my muscles I later sat in a hot jacuzzi. I had a very full fun day but after driving home I noticed that my op foot was unbelievably swollen. I went to sleep with my leg raised on a firm pillow and an ice pack across my foot. This morning it is still slightly swollen.
Is this going to occur every time I exercise and if so; how long for? I suspended my membership at my health club until end of March but when I return, I intend to attend my Aqua fit classes, three times a week as I did prior to my surgery. They are vigorous and yesterday was nothing in comparison.
Why did it swell so badly ?

"I had my 6 week check-up today. I was feeling extremely excited and eager to hear the news from my surgeon that all was well. He watched me walk (impressed). He asked how far I could walk, and was impressed when I said: 登ver a mile without the help of walking aids. He lay me on the bed and checked my leg strength (he said the strength was 妬ncredible). He the manoeuvred my thigh to check the hip rotation (again, impressed).
In conclusion he said that he was very impressed and said that my recovery was 擢irst Class. I then asked him about restrictions: (Going back to work, physio, 90 degree, sleeping position, motorcycle riding, driving), his replies were:
Working: Absolutely not until 12 weeks
Physio  no need as I was doing incredibly well;
90 Degree  keep it in force for another 6 weeks. He said that the 祖apsule around the joint had not set completely and needs another 6 weeks. He thought that the new school thinking of not adhering to the 90 degree rule was OK in theory, but not in reality. He added that it wasn稚 the physios who would have to repair any damage - or suffer the set-back; why would you risk it?
Sleeping  preferably on the back for another 6 weeks, but if I did sleep on my side, I should sleep on the operated side as there is less chance of crossing my legs.
Motorcycle Riding  he recommends a minimum of 9 months, but because of my progress I should be able to ride after 6.
Driving  Not for another 6 weeks!!!! His view was that in the event of an emergency stop, we tense up our whole bodies and that could provoke a dislocation at the worst time  best to be safe.
Well, you could have knocked me over with a feather when he said I had to wait another 6 weeks before I could drive. After all the praise, I thought it was a done deal. Had I been told 12 weeks from the start, it would have been fine.
Having read this through, I feel I should be grateful for all the good news  and I am. But I was so looking forward to being able to get out
As a parting comment, he also said that you could dislocate in the first 12 weeks without warning. After that, you would get some warning from the body telling you to STOP.
Thank you for listenig.

"Hey hippie friends,
I will be 4 weeks post op tomorrow and have been reapplying dressings to my wound as I'm so paranoid about any infection. Do you think it's time to leave it off? The hospital never gave me any guidelines for this. What did you all do and how long did you keep a dressing on for? Wound looks dry. Feels a bit hard and bumpy in places.
Next question is, the TED stockings. How long do you need to keep them on for? Is it 6 weeks? Driving me insane now. They are beginning to irritate my legs. Any advice would be great.
A wee amusing story to share. Had a shower and as I can't bend to reach my legs, got my other half to dry them with the towel. It was so nice for a different texture to be touching my legs and massaging them I was (apparently) almost making groans/sighs of pleasure, hahaha! The simple things in life eh? My fianc burst out laughing saying if anyone heard this they would totally get the wrong idea! Awkwardd lol! Thought would give you all a wee chuckle xx

"3 weeks out from THR I dislocated the joint by leaning too far forward. Taken by ambulance to the ER, xrays confirmed it, and under sedation, the ER Dr popped it back into place. I am now 6 weeks out (from original surgery) and have been very cautious about how I move,  (I also have a bulky, uncomfortable brace to remind me about the precautions), but have surprisingly minimal pain (I had stopped taking the narcotics before the dislocation, and only took them again for another few days).  I am still afraid to try and lay on my side.
My Dr wants me off work for a full 3 months, but due to financial concerns, I have to get back in another 3-4 weeks. I have an office job, and the Dr will write lifting restrictions and other work modifications (my boss even said he would buy me a raised toilet seat to use at work!).
Anyone else experience a dislocation - I would love to hear from you!  Thanks

"My sister had her second hip replacent in January. Her first (left) was last June. With her first she was able to go back to teaching in 8 weeks. The only set back was an infection. She was not able to fully stretch her muscles after the first because her right hip started to go so quickly. While she tried to wait until this summer, the pain was so great that she could not wait. So now she is recovering but it is so different from her first. The recovery is much slower and has has not been able to go back to school yet. She gets very tired and is depressed. Now she is experiencing groin pain on her left side (first surgery). She thought it could be from the physical therapy but after 6 sessions she was told she did not need more. She is not able to stretch on her own at home because she is afraid of the pain she is experiencing. Is this normal? I am not sure what she is supposed to be experiencing at this stage. Should she call her surgeon or just wait and then go back to stretching. She does have scoliosis too. Any words of encouragement or what I should be helping her to do will be most appreciative. She is 58 years old. What is a time frame that she may be able to go back to school? Will she need accomodations?

"This is another report for future hippie anterior...ists. What it is like for me, obviously doesn't mean what it will be like for you.
Yesterday I took my bandage off, ten days after op. Looks clean and healthy, invisible stitches that presumably will dissolve. I'm wearing my partners boxer shorts because my knickers go right across the scar and it is uncomfortable.
I've been doing some walking unaided but I'm wary and hobbling, mostly I'm getting around on one crutch (elbow crutches) so I can carry small items and do light housework.
I have some pain in the hip, a sharp pain if I lay on my side too long (I'm only on my unoperated side) and a weird aching pain in what I think of as my prosthetic/bone join when sitting on the toilet seat.
Sitting upright in my office chair causes a lot of pain in a short amount of time in the hip, and there is some pain in the small of my back at varying times.
I think I am skimping on the organised exercises such as hip abductions and extensions so I had better pick up my game in that area, it might help alleviate some of the pains I'm having.
I'm down to two oxy contin slow release, one at night and one in morning and a few paracetamol over the course of 24 hours and one aspirin in the morning.
Also taking my usual metamucil, berocca multivitamins, fish oil tablets, evening primrose oil tablets, and until tonight when I get the Ducolax pills, I'm still taking Senna pills and laxalose liquid.
Good luck, may all your days be shiny but not too hot.

"Okay I am extremely grateful to have this problem firstly, and AM getting back to normal, and I will never stop feeling so grateful and happy I have my new and gorgeous hip and am regaining my life of sorts. The problems is that I haven't been out properly since last summer, the pain pre op made it impossible, the recovery post op too. Now it seems the powers that be have decided that my recovery is up and I am to now rejoin the human race....which is the moment I have waited for for so long..
Now it is here and....I am frightened half to death. Did anyone else feel this? I thought I would be bouncing out of the door joyfully never to look back.
However, I am finding it incredibly difficult to accept invitations, seem to have lost confidence socialising (after all what do I have to talk about apart from what has happened to me, it has been a major event in my life) even though I am more or less the same on the outside, something has shifted inside...and I still want to stay at home.
I worry about the dark, falliing over and being vulnerable, the uneven ground makes me nervous, shiny floors, seats too low ~ I could go on. In a word I still feel not especially ready. I don't particularly fancy drinking wine in case I hurt myself, I don't know how to 'manage' other people's expectations.
As far as my friends are concerned I am perfectly healthy again, but you know inside there is a little voice that is desperate to stay at home, continue to build up my strength and get some rest when I can (It is totally exhausting some days just keeping going with the children and life in general) I don't want my friends to get fed up with me (and they are quietly I can tell) It is boring having a friend you never see...I feel like a recluse. I don't want them to visit me at home as this feels like a nest and private space, I need to feel quiet.
When I have been out I feel overwhelmed by noise, people, keeping my hip safe, people seem really demanding, everyone is rushing, cars going faster than I get across the road etc.... 
How did you overcome this?

"I havent been around for a while but I wanted to share my day today with you. 
For those who dont know me I had both my hips replaced last year, The right one in Jan and the left one last October. I have been very fortunate with no complications and the usual rollercoaster recoveries but helped in so many ways by this forum and the wonderful hippies and hippies to be.
We are off to France early tomorrow for a couple of days and I have had a busy day today, with housework, packing, out and about doing errands and sometimes I just forget that I CAN do all these things and I have no pain, maybe just a bit tired at the end of the day.  I was waiting for my husband to get home from work early so he could take our dog to the kennels and he phoned to say he was stuck in traffic and could I take Harvey to the kennels as he wouldnt get home in time. The kennels are a long walk uphill and I havent taken him for several years as I just couldnt manage it. 
So reluctantly I agreed and guess what - it was fine! I was a little out of breath but no pain and it felt wonderful to do something I havent been able to do for so many years. My memories of pain held me back and it was only because I had no choice that I was forced to do it.
So today nearly 5 months post op I have learnt a valuable lesson, dont let your memories of pain hold you back. Im going to pick Harvey up from the kennels when we get back from France and start taking him for regular walks again.

"I writing in to say goodbye and thank you.
I will take myself off this forum at the end of next week, in case anyone needs to get in touch with me.
I've found this forum absolutely amazing, so supportive and so informative. I never felt alone even in my darkest moments.
I've always been answered straight away when I've had questions, that has been the most amazing part, the worries soon evaporate when you know that someone else has them too.
I've known from 2007 that I would have to have Hip replacement surgery, and I stressed and sweated and researched, looked at every type, every surgeon, every different incision, I actually put myself through hell.
When I finally took the plunge 20 weeks ago, I couldn't believe the results, I'm still flying, I have my life back and my old self, I can do anything anybody else can do, it's the most amazing op, don't be frightened it's nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be. Yes there are ups and downs to begin with, but just be patient, you will get there in the end.
Thank you each and everyone of you that carried me through, I'm really fond of you all even though I don't know you!

"Two weeks after TLHR I noticed increased sensitivity within my op foot that penetrated down to my big toe; this has now spread to my leg. My GP feels it is a nerve issue that is coming from my back . Last night I tried to lie on my operated side with pillow between legs. Sometime during the night , due to discomfort , I turned onto my back. Today I have a constant dull pain directly over my new hip and am concerned that I may have, in some way, caused some damage to my new hip. Or is it normal to feel pain after lying on operated side?

I am now 10 weeks post op and having physio and doing all the exercises.  I have taken Rocketman's advice and got some walking poles, which are really great.
There are some problems that are worrying me, firstly I still limp and lean to one side badly.  The scar hurts and I cannot sleep on either side as it is so uncomfortable and I am getting a lot of lower back pain.

"Hi guys wanted to let you know that i saw my Surgeon on Wed and he is pleased with the way my Incision looks. The Sutures came out last Friday. I have been letting the Air get to my incision, but i still wear PJs in bed. I am still sleeping on my back 9 weeks now, i just can't sleep on my operative leg Lateral op as it is far too painful. I am far too scard to lay on my good side as my Psysio told me not to because i could go midline. I lay with a pillow under my bottom but i make sure my hips are on the bed and i am not lifting them up. i am going to have more physio in April. It was a beautiful day today as soon as i got out of our card and started walking oh my what a difference from walking athome but i have always known that with 7 years experience on my crutches. My who hip started hurting i had to come home i did a bit too much for first visit out, go home PJ's on back into bed. My left thight started to ache so now i am doing the exercises for both legs. You guys know the troule i have had, caught a Staph infection and had to go back and have the op again, which was cleaned out and the lining of the cup was chanted so much i have had to go throug. My surgeon has put me on antibiotics for another 6 weeks from when i left Hospital on the 19th Feb, They did a test nose groin and swab test on the 15th Feb the day before i went into surgery, and i am pleased to say i am infeciton free no more in me. When i had a shower i had a waterproof dressing on, as my surgeon thought that is how i caught my Staph infection in the first place as i had a shower when my staples came out in Jan and a tiny hole from the staple i could not see the water must of got in. We all have this bacteria on us it only takes a hole or a stratch for it to get in. It was so nice gong out today i was in too much pain had to come home, got into bed PJ's on no more horrid pain.

Later found that it is weeping clear fluid, just a small amount, phoned district nurse who said everything looked fine. Anyhow physio phoned today and I mentioned it and she phoned back to say my consultant want's to see me in the morning and not to take any antibiotics because they need to swab it.

"I had a few ups and downs with how I felt about my fledgling hip....I hadn't expected to feel emotional about it. Mostly I couldn't wait for the pain to stop pre op, and didn't give too much thought as to how I would feel about it after if I am being honest, I was dealing with the practical side of it etc and logistics. Do tell me if you felt the same?
But hadn't prepared for how I would feel after...
Having had some time together, some highs and lows I have come to the conclusion that this little godsend of a hip is my little baby. I am going to nuture it, cherish it, put it before all else, because without this fledgling hip I would truly be in complete dire straights....so now I have bonded with my new hip, the sense of sadness has evaporated....I wonder if I am the only crazy person to feel this way....but had to say it out loud if you know what I mean....I love my new hip and new life, and thank god for modern medicine.

I did have a toilet riser but it was uncomfortable to sit on and I thought I was over the worst of the pain so sent it back to the rental place. My toilet seat is a long way down! I rigged up a wooden box to lean on and I grab the door handle to lower myself down but it is cumbersome, dangerous and tiresome.
Lucky I have my trusty women's urinal at hand. It is in the shape of a small squashed funnel. I can't supply links but you can find it via Google or ebay.

"My stepdad recently had THR, and to our surprise, the surgeon has admitted him into a care facility, instructed no weight-bearing or walking for 8 weeks. Also, he has drop-foot, and cannot bear to put any weight on it, even after a week. And the care facility therapist was instructed to do arm exercises to strengthen them for a walker. We are all saddened because we had no expectation of such a slow recovery. The nurse at the surgeon's office told us that the instructions are just how that surgeon does things, but we know this isn't true because he did another relative's hip a few years ago. Any idea of what we can expect, and what went wrong?

I have never been to hospital before at 64 years of age pretty lucky i suppose
I live in south wales and my consultants list was getting longer i was going to wait until sep this year so i opted for a NHS treatment centre in bristol who got me in for the 1st march all i can say after reading some of the posts on here a lot of you have my sympathy i was back home at 6pm on the 2nd march just paracetamol for the pain i asked if i could go home as there seemed no point in staying in.
and all was fine a couple of days of the blood thinning drugs and i had severe 
diarrhoea not fun with a gammy leg lol
and an eye bleed back to emerson green for a check over and the eyes were all ok and i now have injections for the blood thinning groin does gets sore when i have been walking but i am only doing 15 mins twice a day but all in all i feel fine after the pain i was having before the opp.
I had it done by epidural which i thought was ok and no after effects to cope with.
It looks to having read all the posts on here i shall take my time recovering as i am around the 18stone mark a product of bnotbeing able to keep active pre opp.

I booked it way before Christmas in the belief that my op was going to be early Jan (I got shoved forward to 12th Feb) as a Christmas present for the whole family. It would have easy to back out but I really felt like doing something normal.
After a 12 mile journey, a couple of drinks in the bar, I then sat through a 3 hour gig and got home at 11.15.
I slept through the whole night and although a bit stiff and sore today I am feeling really good. How good to get out and about, my mood is lifted today and there is hope in the air!

"Me  - So, you down there, umm, how you doing?
Hips - Well, no thanks to you, we are fine, thanks for asking. We are a little cosmetically changed but function is resuming.
Me - That's good, I could barely move you for a while.
H- we thought you had us replaced with an elephants leg, the skin is about the same!
M- Sorry about that, I can't reach. I have rules, you'll have to put up with the flakey skin and, umm, the stubble. 
How long is this going to go on for?
About six weeks but I am trying to perfect a kind of golfers bend but it's only good for swiping something off the floor quickly.
You don't play golf, are we taking it up? 
No, we are not. I can barely walk down the road at the moment without crutches but I think you'll agree how good I am surfing the furniture inside.
It's not surprising we can barely walk, do you know what he did to us?
I am fully aware, I was there, but you are going to be better now. The bruising will go, you'll be able to move better without all that lumpy arthritis and I can get you off the drugs.
And the itching? It feels like ants.
My granny would have said that's a sign of healing but the layers of stitching are just beginning to heal up. I am giving you a rub with coconut oil every day, be thankful.
Thankful, she says, we have alien hardware in here that doesn't know what it's doing. It doesn't even want to stand up unless you do that tappy foot thingy.
That's the nerves healing, it'll get better so stop moaning and be patient. We've been through this twice now and if we are good then we should keep the newbies for years to come.
So life is going to be different?
Yep, think how good it was for a while after the first one. We could walk normally and everything. We just have to get through this tough bit at the beginning and then, can you hear it?
Hear what?
Life calling.
Now quiet you two, settle down, have a sleep and tomorrow if you are good we will tackle the steps up the back garden.

Well, I got through it.  First two days were painful and emotional, especially day 1 after the op when I had a bad reaction to the morphine and projectile vomited all over myself the bed and part of the floor.
Day 2 - I was up and out of bed for a while, sitting in the chair and using a zimmer - very stiff and sore though. I refused the oromorph after the bad experience with the intravenous self regulated morphine.  Just on cocodamol.
Day 3 - Feeling a little more human and a little less stiff.
Day 4 - Taught to use crutches and did the stairs.  Told I could walk to loo without support from nurses.
Day 5 (today) o/t asked me to wash and dress myself in outdoor clothes. watched me transfer in and out of bed independently and dais I was ikay to go home.  Physio also said he was happy for me to be discharged and so did consultant.  
So - here I am with a bag full of injections, some dressings and more confidence than yesterday.

I have booked assistance because we are travelling out of Heathrow and the walks can literally be for miles and miles (and we get to speed along in a buggy and not wait in queues and such like, so that is exciting) but do I need to take aspirin before the flight... is there any risk of DVT?
Any suggestions would be greatly received...

"Had my pre op assessment on Monday, 7th March, a three hour ordeal and a very pushy physiotherapist, pushing me to answer questions that I simply could not!
Spoke to my GP's surgery about transportation to and from the Clinic (Private) and a couple of options were suggested.  
I had been told - originally - that I woud be in the clinic for four days/three nights. I put a call through to the clinic asking what I should expect about the release from hospital procedure, and what time of day this was likely to be.  Explained that Iwas trying to line up transportation from the clinic home on the 7th, which is the expected date of release, or so I thought!  A staff nurse called me back  She had not met, so only had my notes.  
We went round and around about release time, for ever.  The outcome was the she had no idea when I would be released.  Stated that if I felt nauseous on the day of release, and they did not need my bed for another patient, I would be kept in!  What this boils down to is that should I feel nausesous, but they need the bed, I am out, anyway...!   She then went on to state, that I could - worst case scenario - be in there for a further two days.  I stated that this was not possible, as I had responsiblilties at home. Then she said that, in all likelihood I would be released late morning on the 7th, the date that I had been told to expect to be released.  
By the time the conversaton ended, I was in state of total confusion.  I asked why, I would still be feeling nasuesous by the fourth day.  No response other than to ask my age, and state that it varies patient to patient.  Can understand the last statement, but still sick into the fourth day?  I thought that this was brought about by the use of certain pain killers such as Tramadol - the opiates - which I would request was not given to me.  
Finally, I had to request that the nurse who actually spent time with me on Monday give a call, so that I could get more clarification on the confusing information I had been given.
However, the final outcome of my conversation was that I should book transport for 12N on the 7th!
Wondering what the forum makes of this, as I am totally confused, and do not want to book transportation should I not be cleared for release.  The confusing element of this is the statement that if the bed was needed, I woud be out, anyway!   Seems to me that this is misleading and nonsensical.
My general health is very good, but because of the OA, have been unable to do any cardiac vascular work.

"I have just had a phone call from the clinic who say that my ecg reading was abnormal and they are wanting me to go to RUH for another reading, which could take months.  This is odd, because I had an ecg taken in December, and it was normal, but was read by the GP, not a cardiologist.
By the time the ecg at the clinic was taken, I was feeling pretty stressed, and uncomfortable because of the central heating, which I reat to ver badly.  I had already been seen by two other staff members, and the physiotherapist, who was the second person, was quite bullying and upsetting, leaving me feeling very stressed out.  The ecg was the last thing to be done, before the lung exray.
Very upset, as this could prolong things by months.
Right now, it looks as though my surgery is going to be put off by months. although they say the abnomal reading does not show any life threatening situation.  They just need to know how to manage it if it ctually exists at all!

"For all hippies waiting and for those recovering this is a message for you. I had virtually all but given up hope of being healthy, fit and well again, and at my age it was really painful to think I would not live a normal life again, BUT I am nearly there if not ACTUALLY there! You could strike me down with a feather, but this operation really DOES work.
This weekend I had my skinny jeans on again (couldnt wear them too tight on the scar) hiking with my girls around the beautiful cornish coast, on the beach in the spring sunshine without a care in the world - hip was fantastic! No limping at all!!!! 
Heels on in the evening going out with my family for dinner, and no one would even know I have just recovered from a hip replacement! AMAZED can be the only word I would describe how we all felt sitting there! Brings tears to the eyes just thinking about it.
Is it all worth it? After months of highs and lows, you bet! Keep going everyone....wherever you are in the journey...at some point soon it will all be a distant memory and you WILL get your life back!!!

"Had to call the district nurse out tonight, because my wound was weeping a little. (had my staples out Wednesday) Think I overdid the walking, didn't seem like it, was loving it, but very stiff later on.  She said it may of caused it. 
So must control how far I walk, she also suggested taking ibruprofen with my codeine and paracetemols, half hour before doing the exercises, she said that would help.
She was pleased with how it's healed, and said it was major invasive surgery and can take a year to heal properly.
So everyone, take care and try not to rush things.

"After I had my first hip done last year it often felt as if I had lost communication with my feet when I was trying to stand up.
One day when I was struggling to stand with my partner holding my hands he said
"" You do it much better when you do that tappy foot thing"".
He was right although I hadn't thought about why I did it or why it worked.
Getting ready to stand now I nearly always tap my foot on the floor a few times. For some reason it seems to tell my body where it is in time and space and I can rise out of the chair easily.
I did think it was a quirk that I did but when someone mentioned that they didn't think their feet and legs knew what to do I suggested my weird foot tap and it worked, and then it worked for a few other people.
I am not sure why, perhaps it's got something to do with severed nerves (although I tap the good foot) but it seems to get me going.
Maybe some will find this mad tappy foot trick useful!

"Hello, this is my first post, and I will explain a bit about myself.  I am a 68 yr. old woman and 26 weeks post-op.  Last Sept. I had a LTHR following a serious accident which broke my femur and shattered my hip. The NHS rose to the occasion, the paramedics were fantastic, the surgeon the best in my area who happened to have a space on his theatre list for the following day, the hospital was good (but the food was awful).  I spent 7 days in there and then 4 days in a private hospital in order to have more physio and recover a bit more before going home.  Once home an OT and a physio visited a couple of times a week until I saw the surgeon again at 9 weeks.  During this time I had to use a walker because I was considered at high risk of dislocation (more about that in a minute), then when at 9 weeks the xrays showed that everything was in its proper place, I started physio at out local community hospital and was on crutches for 12 weeks, and now, still seeing the physio, and on to 2 sticks.  I can walk around the house without aids, at first holding on to walls or furniture, which really helped my balance, but now I can manage without holding on to anything.  The next goal is one stick outside, then no aid at all.  I have worked up to walking ｾ to 1 mile about 4 days a week, do all the exercises set by the physio (some I manage, others not), still walk up and down the stairs in my house like a toddler-can稚 manage any other way, and also still follow the restrictions, the 90 degree thing, etc., although I now can pick things up off the floor by using the golfer痴 reach. 
 I still have discomfort, and sometimes real pain, around my left hip, thigh, and lower back, and my muscles seem to be taking a while to respond and gain strength.  The possible reason for this, and also why my surgeon and the physios were so bothered about dislocation, is that in ten days time I am seeing a geneticist at Guys to be tested for a rare form of muscular dystrophy that runs in my family, affecting both sexes, which affects the muscules around the shoulders, hips, thighs, and ankles.  I have been having some symptoms which might be MD for a few years, and was due to be tested, but after my accident, the appt. had to be rescheduled because there was no way I was well enough to travel to London.  Will not know the results for several weeks as DNA testing takes a while even when, as with our family, you know which gene to look for.  Also, just to add one more thing to the mix, I知 having cataract surgery on April 6, which also had to be postponed, and I feel more nervous about that than the hip replacement. 
 The biggest thing for me was the shock of being reasonably fit with no pain from arthritis, just a bit of muscle weakness around shoulders and thighs, but that didn稚 bother me much.  I walked 2 miles on most days, did everything at the trot, and have always been very flexible and able to bend my legs into positions that left my husband shaking his head in disbelief, but not now.  Even my good right hip hurts now, probably from taking the strain of the other one.  In the days and even weeks following the accident I felt like I壇 been dumped into a parallel universe, but mostly that feeling is improving, and I am accepting what has happened and trying to move on towards as much fitness as possible. 
 Apologies for such a long post.  I wanted to thank everyone on here for such informative and encouraging posts.  Since discovering this site about 3 weeks ago, I have felt so much better and encouraged to keep going.  Thanks you all.

"I have brought this up before but I would just like your opinions all in one place.
I am 53 and have had two un-cemented THR's in 6 months, both because of OA, and have been encouraged to have the Lazy Slob method of recovery.
That is, in the first 6 weeks...
Walking with aids only
No physio
Exercise is moving leg back and forth and slightly out to side a few times a day and rotating and pumping foot.
I take 1 blood thinning tablet for 35 days
No stockings
My recovery for both ops looks as if it's going to be the same and now at 3 weeks after the second I am again walking around the house without aids but using my crutches to support walking when I am out.
The first two weeks were tough but I had had no strains or injuries. my first hip is very strong and doing an admirable job of holding up the new lefty.
After my 7 week check with the first I was advised to slowly build up strength (I drove to the appointment) but was also given some lifetime restrictions of no impact sports, twisting or pivoting to preserve the hip for as long as possible. (My surgeon said I can do the splits, run marathons and take up rugby if I wanted to but he would see me back in his office in 5 years for a revision!!!). Because I was waiting for the second hip to be done my exercise was restricted by pain so I kept fit by swimming.
I know there is no right or wrong and every method depends on the consultant but I have been surprised at the number of stresses and strains that some people have suffered after being made to do exercises by PT's.
I have read about torn tendons, inflamed muscles, swollen knees and ankles and wonder if there is any correlation to the amount of exercise we are given.
This fascinates me and would value your experiences.

"I have been trying to work out why so many of us are given differeng advice with our recoveries.
In reading how despondent Michael was feeling yesterday (another 6 weeks of restrictions) I am suddenly aware that age is everything.
I am 53, I was 52 when I had my first hip done and was devastatingly given many lifetime restrictions. My surgeon said a couple of months ago that ""Wayne Sleep doing the high kicks is not doing us any favours"".
I was considered young (smirks) for THR and all my advice has been pointing towards keeping my new hips in good condition for as long as possible. If I look after these, with a predicted life of 15 - 20 years, if I am a good girl then I won't be looking at a revision until I am 70+.
I had approached my THR's with my usual gung-ho attitude and believed that fitness and exercise would get me back to normal. I now believe that a more genteel existence is what is going to keep me on my feet for longer. Pooh!

"I am 3 weeks post op.  My surgeon said I had to use both crutches until I see him at my 6 week check up and that I am not to take any steps without them, fair enough.  In hospital I was taught to use the crutches by placeing them both a step a head of me, then place the operated leg's foot just behind the crutches and then the other foot next to the first foot and repeat.  I have only been walking around the house and garden so far, but now I want to venture outside.  My question is: do I have to continue walking with the crutches in this manner? as I don't see how it will teach my muscles to walk properly.

"Went into hospital on Thursday night, afraid and sore, I had an uncomfortable night on one these stupid 'air' beds that are probably quite good after the op but hard to maneuver on if you are trying to roll over.
Click here to view image
Next day I went for op. The staff didn't really let me alone long enough for me to panic, though that little child seemed to be following me around wailing and panicking enough for both of us - unless of course it was my own inner child kicking up a ruckus and I was in denial. :D
They had to cut off my knickers because no-one had told me to take them off before hand.
I remember hearing the op in progress at one stage. I won't tell you about it because I don't want to make more stress for the pre hippies. I wonder if I may have imagined it.
I also have a memory of the opp finishing and everyone congratulating themselves and as they were wheeling me out I raised my arm and yelled take me to my bike, I'm going to ride out of here! Lol.
I had some difficulty after that point in post surgery when my temp dropped and I went into really bad shuddering. They had to put me in a bear hug blanket (I think that's what they called it, it was heated) and I had to wear a turban, it took about an hour or more before I was feeling a little better though up until last night I was still having bouts of shuddering when I got too cold.
I have been up and about walking with a frame since yesterday afternoon, I walked to the toilet by myself at least 6 times during the night and this morning (Sunday) I carried my own gear to the shower and wasable to shower unaided. The nurse made a big show of saying how wonderful I was but she probably says that to everyone.

"So in 2014 I broke my pelvis in 2 places. Never healed as I have a bone disease that prevented this. A year later in 2015, I had a THR.... 6 months post op - felt great. Being only 38 it was like I had my youth back.
However, I'm almost a year out since the surgery and starting to feel pain again.
Am I doing too much? I work as a preschool teacher and pick up toddlers ( will be stopping that) - also trying to pack up a house for moving..... And I know I shouldn't do it but there is literally no one else to do it. I'm struggling with feeling helpless when I know I can do it (but can't actually do it because if I do continue lifting etc I feel like crap and at 3:45am cannot sleep due to pain).
I hate asking for help but in the same respect there is actually no one in my life to help if I did as.

The last 1 1/2 years excruciating -to the point I could only work PT and lost my health insurance. I dont know why doctors make you wait so long and suffer! My Dr tried shots in the spine saying it could be lumbar pain radiating,even though it hurt so bad at the groin area where they say is a telling sign of hip replacement .Finally so he could be sure he gives me a hip shot and HEAVEN immediately NO PAIN heaven for 10 days. Now the pain is back so severe I fear my leg is going to give out on standing up.My question is this my knees are shot especially the other side /the left side which had to bear all the wait for so long while limping shuffling.My question is this -with such bad knees will this hinder my hip surgery recovery? My dr wont even discuss it-says the knee pain could get better w the hip -Im like on both sides? Thank you. And I look forward to reading sharing stories while I await this surgery-not long now!

"Hey everyone
Just wondered if anyone else gets like this sometimes.
I am having a bad few days l feel really down and l don't know why. I am just over 2 weeks post op on my 2nd hip. I went out for my 1st walk on saturday and was pleased with how well it went. So done it again on sunday a little bit further this time without my stick again l was over the moon. Next day l did not feel as good but l still said will walk again as its good for me. Again me and my husband went that bit further but half way round l was starting to feel it on my back and hip. I never said anything and just pushed on but by time l got back to my door l was in tears l had overdone it.
I have not been out since and last 2 days my mood has got very low l feel like crying. Its like l have went back instead of forward. I can't shift this feeling of l am not healing as fast as l did with my first hip. I am at the stage l can't be bothered seeing anyone just now as l feel l am terrible company and could burst into tears at any point. I am hoping this feeling will pass as l am quite a posative person and happy. I dont usually let things get to me. Just wondered if this is normal and its happened to anyone else.

How many have been perfectly ok with one done and the other fine?
Just a thought about OA local or does it ""spread""?

"Afternoon guys, i went back to the hospital yesterday to see the nurse that took my staples out all 38 of them. This is my 3rd week at home now, i had my op a month ago today. At this time a month ago i was on that table. The nurse looked at it cleaned it, she pinched around the  1 tiny hole from my staple where i i have been leaking from and nothing  came out of it,  she put and Iodine patch on me and a gauze over that and covering which is not waterproof, so no shower. I rung yesterday and the swab they took last week came back as an infection hence being Infection. My surgeon put me on FLUCLOXACILLIN  a week tomorrow. After all the staple were out my scar and all the scars from the Staples looked great. At that time i had 7 days with no covering on it. Then one moring i stook up and it started leaking down my leg. My bottom cheek smarts when i sit in the chiar downstairs, i have raised blocks under the feet as per instructions from the Physio dept. I would imagine the infecton has gone now, i asked the nurse to take another swab but she felt it was not needed as i was already on Antibiotics. I am seeing my Surgeon tom at 5pm will keep you all infomed, if you guys want to follow me on facebook just let me know, lots of love for now Daywalker x

"hi,
im 3 weeks out, and I'm struggling a bit with lower back pain on my operated side.
i have a tilted pelvis since the op (which I'm told will rectify itself over time). I'm wondering if this is one of the causes?
i had back pain prior to the op, but not as bad as this.
anyone else suffered with this?
is it one of those rings that eases with time?
thanks for reading.

"I am being nosey because our processes towards THR all seem to be totally different. I would love to compare. I am 53 and here is my history, I have tried to be brief, hmmm....
 In August 2014 I was snorkelling off a boat in Turkey, tried to climb onboard and found I couldn't.
In Sept 14 I couldn't get up off the floor at work and had to go off on long term sick from my job working with small children.
I saw a consultant in Oct 14 who shook his head and said x-rays were inconclusive.. He offered cortisone injections 3 weeks later which didn't work. In Jan 15 he tried the cortisone again (failure) although I liked the pain free 24 hours from the local anaesthetic.
Dec - off to pain clinic - no help but booked in for hydrotherapy 
Feb - six weeks of hydrotherapy (liked floating!)
March 15, still off sick, by now hardly able to walk at all, using two crutches and hooked on tramadol. I saw surgeon number two who also shook his head and booked me in for MRI scan
March15 - MRI scan, probably the worst experience of my life.
April - back to consultant this time taking partner in with me. Diagnosis OA in lower spine and hips. Replacement offered for right side first.
30th June 15 - RTHR
Immediate relief in right side!!
Dismissed from my job of 34 years for long term absence.
Left side complaining badly and secong hip scheduled for six months later. Very wonky but no pain in right hip
Feb 12th 16 - LTHR - Yippee, all done.
Apparently I had mild hip dysplasia which might account for early wearing out of cartilage (there was none left which is why the cortisone injections didn't work.).
I played county standard netball for 20 years, took exercise classes twice a week and had a physical job.I now have OA in fingers, shoulders as well as lower spine.
Being in that shocking pain so very quickly I considered my process to surgery to be very long but would like to hear your story. Does it compare?

"hi all,
just wondering when when you guys were walking without crutches or stick?
i am 18 days post op. I had a superpath procedure (supposedly faster recovery time), and the physio is encouraging me to walk around the house without aids.
she has also given me a walking stick to use instead of crutches when I walk outside. 
I am am very happy to use the stick instead of the crutches, as I feel it makes me walk taller and straighter and will help with the pelvic tilt that I have, and that needs to level off.
however, I do not feel at all ready to walk without any aid, and use the stick all the time in the house too. The hip area still feels far too tender. Not ready to bear the full weight at all. I have tried a few steps, and did them fine, but was quite sore and achey afterwards.
I am Definitely NOT chasing a dynamic or swift recovery. I want to listen to my body and take it slowly and steadily, and heal properly.
i seem to remember in previous posts other hippies were saying they had been advised by physios that whilst they were still limping, using walking Aids is very important.
i know we are all different, but hearing other peoples experiences can help a lot when we're just not sure how far to push ourselves.
thanks a lot.

"Morning
I had a lateral THR and have been tending and observing my scar over the last 5.5 weeks.
Until yesterday I had wondered why the surgeon had gone in a straight line and then curved (at the top) backwards towards the buttock. But last night, as I was sitting on the bed, my wife noticed that in the seated position, the incision was a VERY straight line. In fact, so straight, that she even got a ruler to check - big respect to the surgeon!
Is it fair to conclude that we are that position when operated on? I wonder if this applies to the posterior approach too.

I am now eager to progress to get fit again (I have put on about 5 kilo and I'm only 5'1"").  I  have hired a stationary bike for my house.  I attempted to get on it tonight but as my legs are quite short and the pedals quite long it means that even with the saddle up as high as I can put it and still pedal I am borderline on the 90o with my hip/thigh ratio on the up stroke.  Any advice anyone? I know many people are advised to try a bike as part of their PT. I am getting no PT. Should I wait until I see my surgeon in 2 weeks?

"This is a bit of a long, tricky story..
My gran had her right hip replaced just shy of 4 years ago. She has never been stable without a stick but this wasn't much of a problem until about 2 years ago when she felt her left hip was also starting to deteriorate. She had been for an x Ray and told by the surgeon they wanted to put it off for as long as possible. The pain is now excruciating for her in her right leg (on the hip that's been replaced). This pain is down the back of her thigh and causing her knee to give way and buckle. It's so bad that she cannot stand for longer than 30 seconds and cannot lie down either as this causes too much pain. Her GP has told her it doesn't sound that serious and should ease off but currently she is on 6 tramadol a day with paracetamol in between and still in pain. She also has to sleep in a chair because she cannot lie in her bed and is requiring round the clock care for meals etc. does anyone have any advice on what this may be/ any pain relief ideas? I hate to see her in pain but seems like the GP is not willing to help.

I went to a physio chap after 3 weeks and he said i would be ok to sleep on my non operated side if i made sure i had pillows between my legs, I have done this with NO adverse effects (seemingly) for 5 night.Sleeping on my back was really not doing me no good. What would be the general opinion??I have not been able to find anything on the internet that agrees with my physio . I'm ok with it but just don't want to do any long term damage.

I was waiting for a plane When I first felt my hip pain
Got worse throughout the trip started to hurt really quite a bit
At first I thought it might just go away but the pain in my hips was there to stay
As I began to limp along people asking just what was wrong
The cold weather had set in had I pulled something in the gym
Continually the wife would say...I had better go for an X-ray...
Sciatica the doctor said and instructed me to change my bed
He was not sure what was wrong inside and Naproxen was the drug prescribed
I waited and waited for over a year hoped that the condition would eventually clear
And as I waited.. more and more... the pain in my hips grew more sore
In the extreme pain that I began to suffer I soon became a pavement shuffler
I endured the innocence of the taunting kids shaking me off my nerve wracked skids
My Doctor really had to take more notice once I asked for a more thorough diagnosis
""Not much left of your Hips"" came out the Radiographers lips
I was then placed on the list... for a replacement operation for both of my hips
I cried inside a lot to myself... why had I worn myself out ...
With all of that training... and running about...
You have got Osteoarthritis there is no turning back
No self-recriminations and you have to move on as after the operations the pain will be gone
The tests and the forms that the Pre-Op nurses fill as you sit there pensively still
Are you really quite aware of the intense level of self after care
To understand how important to have read... and understand exercise in bed
And you will be up on crutches almost straight away walking the ward every two hours a day
Then the Stair Test you have to perform alone before they are allowed to send you home
For two weeks there is the pain of the scar... easier to bear than the hip pain by far
You really do feel frail in every way but it does get easier almost every day
So here I will sum it all up wishing you all the very best of luck
It is all very new to me... I just fear later I may need a new knee...Hmmmm
But I will say get X-ray in haste....So as not to let your muscles go to waste....

2)  Because my shower is over the bath I can't have a shower for 3 months?  I think that's taking it to the extreme - opinions please.  
3)  The tendons round the hip that they cut to access the joint never heal (except in young children) and that's why your new hip will never be as stable as a nutural hip.  Never knew that.
4)  I have to take a long-handled shoe horn with a hook on the end and a sock thing into hospital.  I assumed they loaned them to you but no - I bought them this morning.  I suppose I will have to use them in hospital.
5)  A man with much higher blood pressure than mine had his hip done last week.  My blood pressure has settled down now but I think it was wrong of the nurse to imply it might prevent my op from going ahead.

"About 18 months ago I tried to get up a rope ladder on a gulet boat in Turkey and my usual flexible body let out a yelp of shooting pain through my hip.
I wasn't expecting the osteoarthritis diagnosis nearly a year later in hips and back but I deteriorated quickly and by April 2015 I could barely walk without wincing. I was down, full of drugs and lost my job to boot as I couldn't work.
As the consultant pointed out the squiggly mess in my joints he said there was no option but to think about hip replacement as bone was rubbing on bone. At 52 I was in the younger bracket but the prognosis was a bit grim without doing anything.
One of the delights of being adopted is that I had no family history to say that early onset arthritis is common in my genes. I remember feeling shock - I wasn't expecting that. I was, however, relieved at a final diagnosis - I wasn't going mad.
I hobbled off for my first new hip on 30th June 2015. Everything went well and although the x-rays looked like my left hip was in better condition it wasn't long before it also started to go downhill rapidly.
At my six week check up my surgeon agreed that I was lopsided (thanks!) and also down to the bone and he would to do the next one in six months.
By Christmas my new hip was strong but I was limping like Quasimodo's cousin. My date had been cancelled for six weeks, I could hardly move and I was miserable.
On Feb 12th I had number two done.
Hooorayyyyyy!
Already I can feel the difference. I am straighter. I have a heavy leg and a sore wound BUT there is no arthritis pain. I have realised just how well my first hip is doing because it's supporting me. Already I can get in and out of the shower and bed by myself. I am sometimes walking (very slowly) on my own in the house but use a crutch when I am tired. I have been shopping, out for coffee, prepare meals (mostly sat on my perch stool). I am still resting a lot but building in a short exercise program every day to strengthen my muscles.
I would say to anyone thinking about this op, or waiting for it, it is not easy. The first two weeks are tough but if you follow the rules, look after yourself and don't do anything stupid, within two weeks you can start to feel hopeful that there is life beyond.
I have arthritis in my fingers, shoulders and spine, but do you know what? In a few years time I can see that they will be 3D printing me some replacements so I'll just carry on healing and grabbing life by the throat.
And you?
Go for it.

The alternative could be a 'deep' injection of Cortisone into the joint.  Has anyone had experience of this please and did it last very long?  I booked a long-haul flight in October which, you would have thought, would be plenty of time to allow the 6 month period when you should not fly long-haul.  I also have my 40th W.A in August so what can I do?

"Before the op, I was always a stomach and right side sleeper. Since the op, I've been a back and left side napper. Am now 12 weeks pos-op.
About 2am today, I woke up to discover I was on my right side. I didn't move for a while and realised it didn't hurt. As I was contemplating this, a nasty thought crept in: ""It might not hurt now, but you might damage something when you drift off again"". So I duly rolled over to the left side again and went back to sleep.
It's obviously a good sign. Can't wait until I'm sleeping normally again. This latest development tells me it will be soon.

Feeling a bit icky, may be General aenesthetic, pain killers or being tired. Not much sleep in hospital. So noisy. 
Today is a nightie on, no knickers or visitors day. May be me feeling icky will keep them away. 
Not much pain just the knot in the bottom cheek people have spoken about. Really odd but not too bad.

"Hi everyone
it is just over 10 months since my left hip was done. Can't say for sure yet if I have benefited from having it done except that the chronic pain has gone. I have at last tried to sleep on my left side with a pillow between my legs as I am only 5 weeks post op from having the right leg done. I managed 3 hours before I had to change position. But at least that is a step in the right direction after 4 years being forced to sleep on my back. Even though I have had so many set backs since my first op. I in no way regret it. The only thing I do regret is not being able to have it done sooner because I kept getting canclled which in the end left me bed bound and in a wheelchair for two years. For those of you who have the chance to get the op done. Please do yourself a favour and go for it as soon as you can. You will get over it much quicker the more mobile you are when you have it done. Yes t is scary. I have now been through it twice and had loads of issues to deal with which is deffinatly NOT the norm. I have been very scared both times. The first time because I was going into the unknown and after things went wrong ( not with the op that went really well ) I got other problems not related to my op. The second time I was scared because I knew what was going to happen to me. But was worried the same problems would be caused again. So far they have not but it is still early days and I am less mobile this time because my surgeon found that my joint was deformed so it was a more difficult and invasive op than last time which has held me back. I will say this if I had, had my right leg done first and it was explained to me what they had found and what they had to do I don't think I would have gone back. So I am glad I had my left leg done first. It is strong and able to take the pressure while my right leg  gets stronger
Please don't let what I have gone through put you off. Nit would be so much worse for you the longer you hold back. Bite the bullet and get it done. 
Hope all are healing well

"Hi guys,
I am 4 weeks post op and doing ok. Still on two crutches for another two weeks, doctors orders as operation was a little complex. Recovery has been slow and rocky to say the least.
I have suffered with pain as long as i can remember. I was born with dysplacia, had the usual treatments of traction, spica cast and pins in the joint. None of the above helped so i continued to have operations e.g derotation of the hip, shelf procedures and was in a spica cast again for 3 months when i was 9. At this point i was being passed from pillar to post to see various doctors at hospitals in the north west of england. It was at Alder Hey Hospital i was told i suffered from something called idiopathic chondrlysis (exuse the spelling). My hip joint would malform and turn into a honey comb, wear away and try and rebuild itself, which again would malform.
This cotinued into my teens and i had a few more ops to strengthen the joint to keep it going. I was asked to have a hip replacement or bone fusion when i was 18 and again at 21, which i declined as i wanted to have children and over ten years ago they didnt know how i would cope through pregnancy.
Anyway i got on with it and the pain and managed to have two children, which i think was the straw that broke the camels back. Both pregnancies were not great, but i got through them and managed to hold down work too. Looking back i really dont know how! My youngest is nearly 1 years old now and my oldest is nearly 3.
After my youngest i went back to work after 6 months to find any quality of life had gone out the window. Iv never been able to walk far, run or sit for long with the pain, but the pain and lack of movement this time started to consume me. Simple tasks of walking into work or walking round the house became almost impossible. Never mind caring for two children, one of whom was starting to crawl. I work in education, which is stressful and i never really talked to my manager about my problems and tried to just get on with it. Taking silly amounts of pain relief to get through the day. I got a letter to go and see my consultant to check my hip after pregnancy and was told i couldnt really wait any longer, the hip was callasping and my pelvis and spine were getting worse. I didnt have any fight left in me and immediately said yes please. A month later i was booked in for the op.
I really thought that this would cure everything and i could finally get some quality back to my life. Its early days and i sure i will. I am determind to walk to the park and go on holiday with the kids and not have to worry how far i got to walk to the nearest seat!
Well early days and i can feel my hip moving more freely already. I even pushed myself yesterday to put my own socks on, which i havent been able to do for years. All this is great and slowly the operation pain is getting better. Bad news is alot of the pain i suffered before well it hasnt gone! Went to my physio yesterday and had a good chat. It has dawned on me that not all the pain i had before was the hip itself, but because of so much trauma over the years i have severe nerve damage. She is going to work with me over a 12 month period to try and repair muscles, tendons ect surrounding my hip and spine and hopefully we will get somewhere. She asked me to speak to my consultant about my nerve pain and spine as she thinks i should be referred in 6 months after i heal from the THR and have this looked at. Thinking back i have been to the Walton Centre about ten years ago and was treated for nerve damage there. It didnt really work and ended up on a pain managment program, to help me deal with pain. So im not holding my hopes up to get this sorted.
Since the op i have been suffering with pain in my right thigh. Well i get a burning feeling and start to loose feeling in it, then the pain comes. Physio said its compressed nerves. Anyone had this?
It prob is just the way im feeling at the moment as maybe i dont like to admit it, but over the last few months with everything going on im thinking i feel slightly depressed. I wont go on at my husband about how i feel as i can see on his face the worries he has for me, so here i am telling you lot my story and the way i feel.
Work are pushing for me to get back as soon as. Obviously they dont worry about your health or seem to care. They just need me back as we got figures to hit.
I just feel like crap. Think in my head i thought the THR would solve everything and i would have a new life. Maybe i will, just not as soon as i anticipated! I am really grateful for what i have and for our NHS who do a amazing job and have looked after me over the years.
Sorry for the rant. I know there are so many people worse off than me and i dont usually go on about it. Just needed a place to off load and carry on. Well im done, thanks for the read. Onwards and upwards! X

"Most of us with OA and hip problems know that life isn't always fun. I have tried to remain positive and find that laughing is the best medicine.My partner has a wicked sense of humour and has laughed me through tears of pain and misery and we have had many funny 'moments'  through my two THR's.
One thing that happened in hospital this time is still making me chuckle...
I had my op on Friday 12th Feb in a small hospital of only two floors. It has the reputation of being haunted by the nuns that used to run it. On the Sunday my fellow hippie in the next bed found ourselves to be the only patients on the whole deserted floor and about 2am we were both woken up by some shuffling noises.
After some stage whispering we armed ourselves and hobbled off to the door to confront the approaching menace.
After what seemed like ages the door was flung open by a bewildered looking nurse.
""I heard you moving about and thought you'd like a cup of tea""
I can't imagine what she thought being confronted by two mad women in their jimjams armed with two crutches and a grabber!
The tea went cold because we were laughing so much!!!
Please tell me your funny stories - I am sure we all have some.

Over  cool or what. The reply, kind and concerned wishing me well, was what caused me to crack and go home early

"I had a TRHR 12 months ago and on the whole have recovered extremely well - able to walk up to 10 miles after 4 months, now doing 3-4 miles every couple of days on average, plus lots of camping in the summer and driving around the country visiting mates.  I'm 63 and not overweight.  The problem is that my hip still hurts - not a huge amount and not all the time, but enough for me to take paracetemol and/or ibuprofen  probably once a week or so.  My GP says that surgery is never a 100%, and if I've got the pain down from a pre-op of 7-8 to a post-op of 1-2 then that's as much as I can expect.  Is this correct?  I've had bunions on both feet done in the past and have no pain or discomfort whatever now.  If the arthritis has been removed - what's hurting??  Anyone any ideas/comments.....?  Thanks.

"A little advice about all of us thats in pain meds. My husband works in pharmasutical industry and knows a lot about the drugs we are taking.
For a starter if you are on tramadol co-codamol or any morphine bassed tablets they are all really additive. Although we all need them we should be careful when we decide to stop.
Our gp should make us aware of this but it does not always happen. Start by cutting your dosage down its called tapering. Especially with morphine based ones. As if you suddenly stop taking them the side affect can be hell and make you really sickm i know someone who just stopped taking co-codamol sfter taking them for years and ended up in hospital in an awful state. Pain vomiting paranoid he thought he was dying all because he had just stopped taking them.
My advice would be to start by cutting down the dosage let your body adjust to less and less. I know thats what l am gonna do and l don't want any of you suffering anymore.

"I took my dogs out, 20 min walk just under and then went to my daughter's match for the first time since the summer which was wonderful initially and I was so excited in the spring sunshine. It did mean I had to walk to the courts which was just five mins either way and then had to stand for an hour watching. It was the standing I think that was the problem,I could barely get back to the car! The pain was the worst it has ever been since I came out of theatre. I am not sure if it was from the hip or the muscles but I was stranded and forced myself to somehow get back, which was so painful, it was bad. Really bad. How come??? Is this normal?
The pain went straight away more or less when I sat down, which was a little bit of a relief but I am confused have I just done too much or have I hurt my hip? 
I didn't think standing would be such an issue.
I was up before 5am today with my little ones, and had the usual full on day and maybe sat down for an hour on and off in total, but this is not unusual although the match on top is.
I have been so happy with my recovery especially in the last few weeks, cycling, walking and managing my very long days very well....so I feel like this is a setback. Any thoughts?

"I know this is more of a ""fluff"" discussion than anything else. I'm sure though, it's allowed!!  I was just curious how people spent their days while recovering? I've been bored, but then found myself watching a lot of movies and TV Series on Netflix. Also, I do my daily emailing. Walk my dog, check mail, drive to PT, run to grocery. This is pretty much how I've spent my time. Add going to the Doctor 3 times or so. I know most of you are in the UK or nearby. I wondered if there were books you especially liked? Movies? TV Series? I thought about one of those ""adult"" coloring books. I hear they are popular in France, more of these books are sold than regular books. Coloring, I bet is a real good way to meditate and have some quiet time to concentrate, stop your mind from visiting all sorts of other places you don't want it to go. Share anything you found to be extra good, fun or entertaining. I watched every season of Person of Interest, and all seasons of Walking Dead. Now, I'm on Blue Bloods.

"Hi all,
I am now officially 1 week post op.
I got home on Sunday and have been managing ok, better than I thought, although struggling with some of the exercises. The standing ones where you put your leg out to side and also behind you and the one on the bed with the leg to the side. Finding them tough? Did any of you have the same?
I went to the nurse today to get my dressing changed and wound checked..
There had been lots of blood on my dressing. She said there seemed like there was a bit of a leak in the middle but hopefully it should stop.
Since I've got home, I've been getting terrible pain from my wound area. There is still some blood coming through? Is this right after a week?
Also the dressing she put on was much thinner with less padding than my original one which is causing me to feel the staples and it's really sore to sit down? Did any of you have this?
I have also been feeling that my thigh and knee on operated side is really swollen and painful. Again is this normal?
Sorry for so many questions? Just a bit apprehensive and worried about it all..

"Seems right at week 12, there is an auto cut off of pain meds. I ( due to several occurances of lack of communication ) had my surgery Nov.23. Still...I didn't start my PT until just a few weeks ago. This is the most painful part of my recovery. I had taken 1/2 a Percocet 5mg, 1/2 hour before PT. I have 3 weeks left. When I called for refill. They said ""no fill"" - that's all. No reason, no question ""how's your pain level?"" nothing. I do think it's an automatic rule, and not specific to each patient. I was a bit miffed and wondered if anyone was still on opiates after 12 weeks. I still have pain that keeps me awake at night and PT is just the worse. I have 4 tablets left. I don't even know if I should wean off these now, or if that's even an issue. It made me feel like a #, not a person. I react poorly to being treated as such. Not sure what to do. If I should call doctor's office back or suffer through the pain. PT is so much easier and I can do so much more when I'm not in pain. If I don't get any more. can Alleve or other OTC pain pill work? I just wanted to quiz the forum.  Thanks

I know it would be nearly impossible to do it afterwards. It's terrible to have to deal with that along with joint and possibly other health issues. It also can effect your self esteem and your results may be even worse because you find it hard to exert yourself very much. ( laying around all day on the sofa watching TV instead of walking or exercizing ) I also wonder, is the pain worse when you carrry a lot of body weight? I know someone who is heavy and they are planning this surgery. I can barely tolerate my private therapy sessions and my BMI is normal. I can't imagine being overweight and then trying to recover. Just curious.

"Hi one and all for those of you who want to follow my progress go to my page. I had to go back into Hospital because when the staples were removed a few days after that one of my staple holes was leaking. After 4 weeks of chaning the dressing and Antibiotics i was back in Hospital on the 16th. I have been to see the nurse today who changed my dressing, as hubs as been doing it for a month. As i have said before my Surgeon seems to think that when the staples cames out and my wound was not dressed that i got it from i had a shower, the only think that make sense to me is before the staple hole started leaking the hole must of been big enough to let the shower water in hence my Staph infection. I have 2 more weeks of dressing then i go back and have the sutures. My surgeon told me not to have a shower for a week, it is killing me not getting in it, have to wash everyday, better than not washing at all. I have never been so scared in all my life, i think i am slightly OCD anyway but this is making me worse. I wash my hands many times in the day anyway, i just don't know, i am keeping my head above water, but the sad thing here is i have to sleep on my back for another 5 weeks and these white socks, phew starting revoery again is hard. i know we can be too clean with ourselves and around our homes.

"Dear hippy clan.....
I have a concern. Rose's survey suggests that there are a goodly number in the present cohort of recent hippies who have struggles in and on the road to revovery.
I suss I've had a better than average recovery myself, as a pretty fit 70yo guy. But, at the time of my operation and after, nearly a year ago, everyone else seemed to be throwing away crutches after a couple of weeks, driving, doing tap dancing or whatever. Sooo, while this site is lovely, it was a little hard for me to post I was struggling to cross the longue without crutches, hanging onto furniture and then lunging to the next piece of furniture!
Now though, every one to gloomy and struggling, so it seems a little hard  to post I've just walk 20,000 steps or 11 miles across fenland at the weekend!
Sooooo, let's celebrate ups and downs - whatever the prevailing weather!
Take care

"HI to those I know and to those I do not know.  I have not been engaged with this wonderful site for a while, too long, and I miss it!  This site helped me survive one failed THR and the revision.  
Quickly my story...First THR went perfectly.  It was an anterior approach method and within five weeks I was moving about like I had never had surgery.  Second one went wrong within the first couple of weeks.  My surgeon tried various proceedures to help the situation but to no avail.  Then I was kicked out of his practice because I missed two payments on my account and I was left writhing in pain, crippled, for life.  That is how it felt.  I could not move without screaming and I became depressed.  My whole life was changed by this.
THEN I discovered this site and the wonderful people on here helped me go for a second opinion, taught me to research the surgeon first and I chose Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, USA, about five hours from my home.  That surgeon found the problem immediately, while the other could not, and it was that my device had come loose and was migrating, twisting and projecting outwards, hitting every nerve possible.  So he did the successful revision!  Revisions are tough.
Around 6 months post op I began to pray for a part time job and one surfaced almost immediately.  A light duty janitorial job for two hours a day.  And I can tell you that after laying aound deteriorating for two years, it left me MORE than out of shape!  The first two months at this job left me feeling that I was going to die!  Oh my!  I am 57 and never felt so weak in my life.  I sweated, I mean drenched with sweat because the physical exertion was so difficult to do.
Then my newest hip began to hurt.  An x-ray showed that there was no damage, so I just had to work out the kinks. I was very careful not to break the 90 degree rule and twist while breaking it.  Now I am 10 and a half months post op and feel stonger, more flexible than I have in a long time.
It feels good to be back out among the living, earning a little money, and feeling a sense of accomplishment that the bad THR took away from me. And I job share with a friend who covers me when I cannot work.  I am proud to say that I just accomplished working five days a week three weeks in a row!  
After all that extreme pain I suffered, I want you to know that I am having  many, many mornings when I awaken and feel absolutely no pain!  I lay there and thank God for moments like this and try to just soak up the good feelings before I have to get up to begin my day.
When I was down and out with all that pain and failed device, that was all I could think about.  Life all but stopped and sometimes I wished I were dead.  Now I can reach higher levels of thinking.  I have even meandered around my yard making mental notes of what needs done in the Spring and actually feeling as though I will be able to complete the tasks.  
I want to send the message that no matter how bad off you are right now, it will, it can, get better.  Just around the corner there is life as you knew it.  And for those who are permanently in pain, know that my heart goes out to you and I admire how you survive.  You ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE TO HEAL RIGHT, so be patient with yourself and your medical team and do what you are told to do.  There is nothing wrong with stretching yourself to see where you new boundaries are as you progress, but do so carefully.
Hugs to all!
Dawn, USA

"Hey all,
Well I had my op on Wednesday and was on Bed Rest for the remainder of the day as still didn't have all feeling in my legs from the epidural.
So guess I'm just moving into my second day post op...
My wound is really sore and when I try and move I feel as though it's locking and clicking in and out of place, is this normal?
Physios came and got me up yesterday. Really struggling. I have managed to be marked as Independent with wheeled Zimmer frame but I'm having a lot of bother trying to get on and off the bed. My leg is just so so heavy and i don't have the strength to lift it.
Only got shown the exercises late yesterday with the board and rolled up towel etc so haven't had the chance to really do any yet.
What's really worrying me is that my surgeon popped into see me last night, he said that I should get home today. I really don't feel confident or comfortable to go home. Struggling with the bed and haven't attempted a lot of other things and trying to get the pain meds right to control it.
I'm really concerned that I'l be sent home and not ready to be there yet..
Any help or tips would be appreciated.
Thanks X

"I'm at week 12 or so.. I've sort of stopped counting after 3 months. Well, the 23rd will be the three month mark. I found that after my surgery, I had absolutely NO appetite. I still don't. The home health team asked me ""how is your appetite?"" and I told them I didn't have any. They began to run down a list of things I should be eating, but I only gagged at the idea of ""Salmon"" or ""MEAT"" of any kind. I'm not a vegetarian or anything, but meat just seemed awful. Also, any form of ""protein"" to build back muscle. I did find that there are Boost drinks and ones with Protein added.. one has 28% of your daily need, so I make sure I drink 5-6 daily. Tnat's all my intake is... these nutrition drinks. I've had friends go to the store, I have to then throw out whatever it is they bought and lie, saying ""it was delicious"" -  I even hide things in my oven so people will think they've been eaten if I'm surprised with unexpected guests. I haven't seemed to have lost weight from looking at the scales. Maybe this is normal? I seem to get all my daily requirements of vitamins, minerals, calories and most of all protein from these drinks. I'll go out with friends and they'll order a meal, and I'll order iced tea or maybe a mixed drink. They all comment... ""why aren't YOU eating?"" ""How long has it been since you've had a decent meal?"" I don't lie. I just say."" I'm not hungry. The idea of eating makes me want to gag. I've tried believe me. "" Then it starts again, people bringing over food. Sigh...I've never had this happen to me before, I'm 59. I've gone on diets, I've eaten salads, I lost weight when I needed to by eating healthier and becoming more active. I wondered if anyone else had this problem? Do I need to talk to my doctor ( my GP, not surgeon )? See a nutritionist or dietician? I don't know what to do. I can always Google these things. I felt like right after my surgery, when I was on pain meds, that the opiates were masking hunger ""pains"" as well as the hip pain. When I stopped the meds, I still found myself unable to eat. Any comments are welcome. I'll attach a photo taken yesterday, and you'll see I'm not a skeleton. I think I ""look"" healthy, but how can I exist on liquids alone? How long am I going to be this way?

"Hi all, just wanting anyone to give me any info at all I will be having my hip replacement replaced in 2 to 3 months time. It's lasted 13 years the plastic liner has worn away, after many tests over last few months the surgeon says it definitely need replacing. Question as I keep telling him I am not in pain, the pain I had before met first hip replacement was horrendous, I also had a limp. After the op I was pain free and no limp. This time it's different, yes it can ache and the odd slight bit of pain. Just wondering if I should hang on a bit as I am only 49. Has anyone had experience of this?

"I joined this forum a good few months ago but before that l just used to have a nosey at everyones threads and worries and how supportive everyone was but 1 girl stood out to me she seemed to be very young infact the youngest on the forum . A few months down the line and me
and her are good friends.
I just wanted to write something about how brave this girl is. We are all on here for various hip replacrment issues but if you knew how long this girl has been suffering....most of her life probably. She has already had 12 ops on her hip and spine. But soon she is going in for her very 1st hip replacement and its not just a straight forward hip replacement its much more complex than that which l am hoping gives her a life she deserves at such a young age. Thats why l don't like moaning as we sometimes don't know how lucky we are when you hear what she has been and gone through.
I just want to let her know l will be there for her no matter what as l am sure everyone will be.
Getting to know such a special person has been a privalage to me. I hope to be her friend for a long time.
I want to wish her all the best in her 1st ever hip op and hope it all goes to plan. We just don't realise how lucky we all are.

"I had my hip joint exploded out of the socket back in 1977, closed reduction, sort of pushed the ball back into place and was in traction for @30 days. I'm assuming the driver of the 72 Cadillac Eldorado with the 455 in. big block motor was drunk when that huge hunk of steel hit head on the little 71 Toyota Celica myself (driver) and 3 other college dorm mates. The funny part was the driver got out of the wreck and ran away, and since no one died there was no police investigation. That's LA for you. Anyway 23 (1/2000) years later hip became so worn down I needed a THR. The surgeon was an ex navy seal so I thought I was in good hands, needless to say you get the good with the bad, hip replacement went fine, but ended up with I think it's called drop foot syndrome, I think he cut a nerve.  I can't lift my left foot up, but can push down and side to side, right foot is fine. Small blessing, I can still drive because we Americans drive on the correct side of the road (the RIGHT side of course) LOL. Sorry for such a long story for a short question. I've had this foreign body in me now for 15 years, at the time the doctors said I might need a replacement, they estimated 2000 era artificial hips lasted 10 - 15 years but hip feels as good as ever. Never found out what type or what company manufactured the ball and socket. If anyone out there has a THR that's been in you about the same length of time as mine, would you care to share experiences and maybe a heads up on what to expect if I need a new one. The doc's told me the replacement would hurt much more than the first one, I guess removing the cemented part in my thigh bone would cause the most pain but since I'm pretty sure I'm going to be totally under I won't feel anything till I wake up, can anyone tell me what THAT will be like, and how stable will this one be. Since it's been 16 years of technological improvement will a new hip be better than the one I have now? I also assume techniques have improved, I hope. I kinda just want to connect with THR, hippies with histories similar to mine. Oh, last thing I feel no ill will towards anyone connected with my lifelong struggle with this event, I estimate about 3 BILLION humans are worse off than myself. Just wish I had the intestinal fortitude (guts) to finish university.

"Hi Fellow Hippies,
Something weird happened last night/early morning. I was standing up fixing the blanket on my bed. I dont know why( old habit maybe or just sleepiness) but I kneeled on my bed on my operated knee and then lost my balance and rolled back onto the bed with my leg bent underneath me. Amazingly my leg was not turned inward or outward. I felt my ankle andcknee crack( no pain). Almost like a super quad stretch but not in a good way. I have some discomfort and have been icing the groin, lower back/ buttocks and outer thigh. I am able to walk with my cane as I had before. Of course now I am scared that i did something to the hip replacement. Since I am fairly new to the hippie world, would it be obvious if i dislocated hip or did damage to placement of new hip? I'm not sure what it would feel like. I am 6.5 weeks post op and am going for my follow up on Monday, so I'll know for sure then. Hope I just over stretched some muscles. Thank you for any insight.

"hi everyone,
just reaching out to those of you who have been post op for a while.
I'm 11 days post op and have groin pain that is quite strong when I walk or do the bed exercises. On Friday the physio advised me to stop the exercises (that I felt were aggravating it), and to just do regular 4 point walking (left crutch when stepping forward with right leg and viva versa). I still feel the pain when doing this walking. It isn't intense, but it makes me kinda nervous to weight bear on operated leg, which I know is important to help get the pelvis realigned and make my gait normal. 
I'm definitely not trying to do too much, or to get ahead of myself, but i do tend to assume worst case scenario on things that don't quite make sense to me. Am perfectly happy to accept that this is my kink in my road to recovery, that will get worked out slowly and steadily over time. Just want a bit of reassurance that it isn't something more ominous.
anyone had anything similar?
thanks,
lindsey

"I was thinking as I brushed my teeth this evening how pleased I am that I had my teeth checked, cleaned and whitened before my hip operation, I had not realised the restrictions to dental work pre op, this provoked some thought as to all the things I am happy I did before this operation:
1) Teeth checked at least twice, cleaned and whitened (if needed or desired)
2) A 'gel' pedicure ~ mine has lasted for 12 weeks, and even in the moments I didn't feel human looking at my feet was a constant pleasure and reminder that all is well. 12 weeks you can easily have them re-done by then...small pleasures and all of that! There is no chance of doing your own toenails afterwards so it needs some thought...
3) A freezer bursting with homemade food, or by cook  or by other means this was the nearest thing to heaven and anyone can reheat it ~ think four weeks plus and you have covered all bases
4) Setting up email and internet on my iphone and ipad, staying connected is a great source of comfort 247 for those early mornings or late nights.
5) Flu vaccines etc, you DONT want to get the flu after a replacement. I didn't have one and thought my stitches would burst with the effort of coughing and sneezing. Or I would literally dislocate with the effort. A vaccine will keep you safe and well.
6) Working out to the last minute (even if you hate working out) get those arms pumped, get your legs in shape, with whatever work out you can bear to do, it makes a huge difference to your recovery and your ability to take long walks on crutches.
7) Set your bedroom up as a self contained area ~ you will value having everything to hand
Click here to view image
9) Keep a diary pre op and post op, many recommend this especially Rocketman and this will show you the HUGE progress you have made, even when you feel you are standing still
10) A collection of fresh soft new nightwear, lounge wear for at least two weeks. This is not neccessarily costly but will be such a comfort to you, particularly if you are coping or managing largely or solely alone. 
11) Remember nothing is worse than the pre op pain, and where there is hope there is light, and once you have the courage to accept the operation, the whole world is a possibility once again as soon as you have this operation....the alternative....well the alternative means a life of permanent disability and pain. Post op is infinitely better no matter where you are on the journey to recovery.
Do feel free to add to my modest and spontaneous list..I feel blessed to be on this journey with all of you, regardless of the hurdles we face and overcome together. All of you have been a constant source of comfort and hope. Thank you.

For the past 4 years i have struggled with what i thought was pain from an injury where i tore my quad muscle, after recent xrays it appears to be severe OA. My issue is that i run my own business and am concerned re the resting time post op. 
Q1 - How soon will I be able to sit and work a lap top?
Q2 - How soon will I be mobile (with crutches)?
Q3 - How soon can you walk unaided up stairs?
Q4 - How soon can you shower?
Q5 - Are you able to go to the toilet unaided?
Q6 - How bad is the scar? Booked for a beach holiday in August and worried about how bad it may look.
Q7 - How many of you had to have a blood transfusion? I have been told its advisable to give your own blood first just in case.
Q8 - How often and for how long is the physio afterwards?
I am having a Taperloc Stem ceramic on ceramic hip.
Thanks in antisipation of your advise.

"Hi everyone,
I'm 29 and had a total hip replacement a few days ago on Friday 19th February due to a bad fall back in June 2015. Overall I'm quite sore but I was very pleasantly surprised that my pain from before the operation has completely gone!
I came out of surgery and it took the anaesthetists a while to wake me up and they took a while to monitor more. I was able to start mobilising the same day of surgery but I was connected to a lot of tubes for painkillers and fluids so was only able to stand and make one small step. What came as a shock was that since June of last year I have been non weight bearing and all of a sudden I'm fully weight bearing!!
When walking I'm still feeling scared of putting weight on my right operated hip as I haven't been able to do so for a so long. This is still a struggle a few days afterwards but I need to work on it.
My main concern at the moment is that to me the right operated leg seems longer than the left non operated. Has anyone else experienced this? Does this even out in the end? And how long would I need to wait?
In terms of the soreness and pain, how this in the first couple of weeks? Is it simply a question of trying to manage the pain?
Thank you
Andrew

"hi all,
like many any before me I've read through lots of postings prior to the op. Now it's the real thing.
I had my op at 8am on Thursday. It's now sat night and I can't get to sleep. Have dozed lots during the day though. Each time I got out of bed to do an obligatory walk on crutches I was exhausted. Normal I guess?
was in quite a lot of pain immediately post op so had pretty high dose of morphine which knocked me sideways. Further doses on Friday had me hallucinating and with the shakes. Intravenous paracetemol eventually did the trick, (and I'm avoiding any opiates like the plague)but as I'm going home tomorrow I'm now just on the pills which don't have quite the same pain killing Effect.
the pain isn't a 10, more a 6, which has me dreading having to get out of bed and to the toilet, as I know it'll get worse.
it feels like my pleated leg is longer then good leg too. The surgeon said that the legs are exactly same length, and that post op X-rays showed that my pelvis is tilted. Apparently this is very common and rights itself after a few weeks of walking properly. But I guess I must have some special instruction from the physios to make this happen. Plus it's kinda scary to find myself walking like this.
i think I'm in a bit of shock too - just from the trauma that my body has gone through. I cried like a baby earlier before my husband went home.
im sure this is all normal, and in fact ion reading lots of posts prior to the op, I registered that in the majority of cases the first 2 weeks are pretty bad, then people seem to start to slowly turn a corner.
so, I guess I'm just sharing and looking for reassurance that this stage will pass and things will get better.
thanks for reading my ramblings.

"hi,
i am 10 days post op, and have been advised by physio to do some more walking and less bed exercises (they were irritating my groin/psoas). My soft tissues don't like it, and I trying to find the right balance between enough movement for healing, and too much pain.
i think/know that my pain medication is very low ie cocodamol at the lowest codeine level of 8mg per tablet.
i am interested to know what pain meds fellow hippies have used in say the first 6 weeks post op. From everything I've read, good mobility and ROM are crucial to a strong recovery, and I don't want to hinder my recovery by being in more pain than is necessary.
i can't take NSAID's , and I struggled with the opioids given to me in hospital. However, now I'm home,I can think sensibly, and realise that there is probably a stronger pain med that I could tolerate which won't send me ""wappy"". I will call GP tomorrow, but am sure that others out there will have some helpful info/advice.
Also, what advice have you been given re the minimum amount of movement at different stages of recovery?
a lot of questions, I know.
thankyou.

"I have to go to confirm my continuing enrolment in my tertiary course today, which involved a hike to the train station, train trip, and hike at the other end.
First time I have been on a train since my op 8 weeks ago... getting on was okay because there was barely any gap on the platform. Getting off was a nightmare because of the gap between the train and platform at the other end. The conductor held my crutches while I gingerly stepped down (on the wrong leg)... it was scary.
The return trip was worse. There was no seating at all in the vestibule near the conductor, so I had to stand all the way home. When I arrived at my stop, the conductor didn't even look out, so no hope of help this time. The gap this time was enormous and I actually had to jump off the train onto the platform or the doors would have closed on me.
I have to do it all over again on Monday. How do people cope? BTW, I'm in Sydney...

I asked when I could have bath and he said now as long as I'm careful getting in and out and can sleep on my side as long as I don't cross legs.  He was also quite happy that I had discarded my TED socks in the first week or so and that I was now driving.
I was told that if I ever have any major infection and need antibiotics even if it is not connected to hip I should let them know as soon as possible.
next check up in a year unless I have any problems.
He did mention that I looked a lot better than I had done when he first saw me in October when, he said, my face had shown what a great deal of pain I had been suffering.  My oncology nurse had said almost exactly the same when I had that check up last week.

"hello fellow hippies
ok I am going to try and explain what is going on before I talk to my surgeon. Then I will fill in the bits I don't know the answer to yet or  correct if I am wrong..
first of of all I got back to the ward. I had just come to acept that it was all over. I was in so much pain. This never happened with the left hip. The nurses wanted me to roll so I didn't get pressure sore. But when I tried the pain was so intense I fainted. That never happened on the last hip. I said it is too painful to roll and they just said grow up you have to roll. I said I can't roll there is something wrong. There was an hours argument it then dawned on them I wasn't kidding. It also felt very different. I asked the nurses what was used to close the wound they went and looked in my file and they had used those metal staples when I had like last time requested melting stitches so I am not happy with that and that is what I suspect is causing the pain.  So  they got my anethatist up from theatre and he gave me some meds and after about 5 mins I was more comfortable. So then the nurses understood and I said told you so I wasn't just being a wimp. 
It is now 4:20 am and the pain is back. They got another anethatist up who has given me more tramadol. I might ask my surgeon if he can take me back to surgery remove the staples and put in the stitches I requested instead. 
I am am also not allowed out of bed for a week because I have to wait for a body brace to be made and fitted so when I walk I don't dislocate my new hip. I will have to wear this for at least 6 weeks.  So this upset me and I won't find out what or why this happened till I see my surgeon today. 
I am so fed up of people not listening to me that I feel I am talking to a brick wall

"I don't know how I used to walk before my op.
Stupid as that sounds, here is the thing. I know that some legs can ""set"" at an angle (where the toes point outward) as a result of a THR. But as I had never studied my foot position before the operation, I am not aware if the current setting is correct or not. In either case I am concentrating on placing my heel and then toes in a straight line to ensure I ""learn"" to walk correctly; my wife watches to keep an eye on me. And, for me, it is becoming natural to walk this way. But this could have been easier if I had observed my walking before the op.
Anyone have an experience or views on this?

If so what strenth were they prescribed.
I don't just want to phone and ask gp for them if they will not prescibe them or if l don't know the strenth.
I could always call hospital and ask what strenth l was given and how often l had to take them.

"Hi everyone
Eleven days post op now. During that time I have been doing the
exercises as suggested, walking around the house on crutches (a lot) and am making good progress. What I have noticed though is that I have gained a few pounds already.
Considering I have hardly had anything to eat since the operation I expected to lose weight at first not gain it!
Could the weight gain be down to all the painkillers we have to
take? The ones I am taking include tramadol, paracetamol,
Codein and ibuprofen. What do my fellow hippies reckon?

"Two years ago, I was given a couple of sheets of exercises to do by a physiotherapist, after I had been diagnosed as moderate to severe arthritis in my right hip.  I have followed them, with the occasional lapse.  Lately, I have embellished a couple of them with foot rotations and flexes - the leg lifts.
I have found that the stretches have been very helpful, indeed.  The leg muscles and foot of the affected hip were distorted and atrophied.  Since doing the quad, hamstring and calf muscle stretches, I have found that my calf muscle, which was rock hard, has relaxed considerably, to the point where I can now stretch the leg well out behind me and keep the heel firmly on the floor.  The quad muscle and hamstring are not as atrophied and again, they are softer.  I am able to bend and touch the floor with the tips of my fingers, although my knees are still not straight.  Have added some push ups to strengthen upper body, for any etra work it will have to do post op.  The physio told me that my arches have dropped somewhat, so I am picking up pencils with my toes, both feet, as this causes the arch to flex and strengthen, so that post op, my right foot will point straight ahead and not to the right, as it has had a tendency to do.  Also I bend backwards looking up at the ceiling, and put my hands on my butt to stretch my spine.  I have just started this, and it is not very comfortable, but I am slowly beginning to feel the benefits.
I am doing all I possibly can to keep my body as flexible and strong as possible, particularly the spine and muscles supporting it, as I have noticed that I get lower back pain now, as my lower back is having to do the work of my hip.  I do still get sciatic pain, but but is not as frequent, and seems to locate itself more toward the lower end of my calf muscle toward the ankle.   
I have been told that what I am trying to do, is not going to make one iota of difference to me post op.  Is this true?  Am I wasting my time and effort, surely not?
What is important to me, is that I am trying to contribute to the work that the consultant/surgeon will be doing and with any luck, speeding recovery by working the affected muscles.  The biggest hurdle, I suppose will be the recovery of the nerves and muscles around the hip replacement itself, and various swings in mood and pain following surgery.  
I am wondering what other members' experiences have been post op, after following a pre op physio exercise program, or whether or not there are those who did not follow a regime, and what their experiences were, post op.  
It would help me enormously to know wheter or not what I am doing is of benefit, particularly at this time, as I am to see the consultant for the first time next Monday.  The appointment will be ""drawing a line in the sand.""  Until then, I have felt that I am standing outside the door, waiting my turn to come in.  Once I have seen him, I am committed, and have stepped over the threshhold!

"Just read Linda's great news!  She has about two weeks to prepare.  I am wondering if cancelatoins usually give that length of time to line up the ducks, or deos it depend entirely on individual circumstances, as to the length of notice that is given?
I am on my own, with not much in the way of outside support.  Accepting a cancellation will not make much difference in that regard.  I do have one or two contacts that can come in and help, but they are people from the local community that I do  not know.  I have no idea to what extent Social Services will be of assistance, other than providing the usual practical aids. I am not sure where SS leaves off and where my own support people would take over.
My feeling is that once I have seen the Consultant on Monday, I should start lining up my various ducks and  vet the people that have offered to feed the cat, empty the garbage can, etc.  I would pre-order frozen meals that can go in the microwave, but if I am on crutches, I have no idea how I am going to be able to carry pots of tea or coffee, meals, etc, from one room to the next with two crutches.  I have taken note of Graham's vegetable trolley suggestion, but wonder if things are going to jump around and spill over going across carpeting?
I have no idea how wobbly I am likely to be post op, but would think that they would not let me loose until they are sure that I am able to do the basics.
I am aware of all the common sense precautions, such as always having both the mobile phone and cordless in a pocket, etc.  Taking up the area rugs, ensuring there are no hazardous objects in my way, electrical cables, etc., but wonder if I have covered everything, mentally, if not practically?  
Being alone, post op, is a very scarey situation, and I am not wlling to go into a rehab situation.  My daughter's father died recently in one of those, following a hip replacement and an infection that he picked up - so, no way, Jose!

"Hi, I'm 37 and due to have my THR at the Spire in Harpenden on Tuesday 26th of Jan so not long. I am so totally dreading it I cannot tell you. From reading this and another forum I've gradually got more and more freaked out and anxious about it and what's to come. It all seems tales of hell, pain, limping and using walking aids even months down the line and I can't bear that thought. And the lack of sleep! I am so tempted to cancel it or run away at the last minute.
My hip is sometimes really bad and sometimes fine. For example I am currently in Cape Town on holiday and this morning I climbed a mountain for a hour with no bother at all. Last month I was in Italy and couldn't even walk around Verona without a heavy limp in total agony. I'm stressed out about the scar which makes me feel really vain when I'm normally not at all. 
Anyoen my age able to reassure me this is worth it and I'll be able to walk ok without an aid pretty soonish?
Thanks and so sorry for moaning.

"Day 3 and about to be discharged. I have had two physios in the same hospital. I must say that neither was particularly helpful. Perhaps it is becasue I am an NHS patient in a Private Hospital - who knows. 
But here is the thing. One said that the 90 degree rule is not something to worry about as the chance of a dislocation is so small. He was not saying I should constantly break it, but that I should not be paranoid about it. As a result he was not worried about the various chair heights at home - except the loo seat. 
The lady physio emphasised the importance of it, but conceded that there is a lot of chat about this in the physio world as it does not appear to be such a big thing. The line between your legs (which must not be crossed) and planting you operated leg and twistng were much more important.
I shall err on the side of caution, but wanted to know if anyone else had heard of this.

"Hi all,
I'm wondering if some of you have experience with this. I had my second hip done on Wed. Jan 20, about 7 wks after the first one. When I walked following surgery, it felt like my right foot was going into a hole with each step-- That there was a significant difference in leg length. Everything else went fine although my dressing is larger than the first time. Surgeon wasn't at all defensive when I saw him the next morning. He listened to my concerns, said he thought legs were good and told me to give it 6 wks for swelling to go down and that it usually resolves.(No mention of why there was so much more swelling this time.) I came home Thursday afternoon and am keeping ice on it and doing exercises. It maybe has changed a little bit but whole hip feels so lumpy and bumpy and it's as if I can feel the new joint inside which I never did before.
I like and trust my Dr. and intellectually I knew it might be different this go round but it is disconcerting nonetheless and makes me fearful and blue. I have no stomach for additional surgery.So, I know it's premature but I am seeking reassurance if anyone has lived with this. Thank you. Gail

I had the op on Thursday and am starting to feel human today.
I have disolveable stiches and no drain. So I think I am a lucky chap.
But what made me laugh, is that, as a bye, the surgeon said that 15% of ceramic hips develop a squeek. You thought that he may have mentioned it before the op. But, hey, you have to go with the flow.

my surgeon has let me out of bed and I tried to walk. I walked round my bed and sat in the chair on the other side. Like everything else the chair was not high enough so was uncomfortable to sit in. I was in really bad pain because. This hip feels so different to the last one.  I do know that I have to take into concideration that my leg will be using muscle it hasn't used for years. I also have to take into concideration that my hip deteriorate so much. But the way he did  the op is no different than when he did my right one. But to err on the side of caution. I am to wear a brace for 6 weeks once it arrives. I'm so glad I had my left hip done first because this has helped me cope a little more and it is almost as strong as the original leg.   The pain is intense and nothing at the moment is helping with it. So they have upped my oramorph to 15 mil to try and make me comfortable. This just goes to prove no two legs are the same on anyone. I hope this pain will subside  given time but right now I feel like my right leg has been chopped off not replaced. Things I know will settle down. I am just disappointed they didn't go the same way as before.

An friend came to see me yesterday, I haven't seen her in a couple of years.
I related my long, drawn out, hip saga and bemoaned the state of my life now. She sympathised and then told me her story....
Her first hip went well, no complications apart from a missed diagnosis for the past 8 years! The second hip, here she paused, not wanting to tell me, but apparently two weeks after the op she tripped over her cat, fell against her dining table, broke her femur and dislocated the joint - eeeeeeeek!
I shut up moaning completely!
We are both in Cornwall but had different consultants/surgeons. My friend is 4 years younger that my 53 year old self. I was under the impression that a cemented joint (hers) was never done in younger people? Mine will both be un-cemented.
I wonder what other people have, cemented or un-cemented, is it age related (I thought) or something different? It turns out that my friend did so much damage because the cemented bone was stronger than the stem.

However, I had the feeling that she did not fall into any of the usual or straight forward THRs.  She was tiny, fragile looking and quite clearly with a very light and delicate bone structure.
I have checked him out on the hospital's online credentials webstie, and where he trained, etc., but is there any way of checking if there are negatives on record?

"Update from Minnesota: Brr. lol
Just a bit of good news to lighten the day from me.  Some of you know I've been going through the trenches. Over-eager therapists, over-eager me, the lovely psoas tendonitis which made lifting my leg extremely painful.. all the fun stuff!
I had an injection last week into my psoas tendon with ultra-sound (mildly uncomfortable, but not painful).  It took 3 days to start working, but a week later I can say it wiped out the problem  100%.  
That has made my exercises easier, walking more comfortable, activities that involve lifting the leg feel almost normal.  So, with all that, and after having a week to really get back into my exercises, my therapist graduated me today with a finger shaking stern faced but happy voiced warning to keep working hard.
Still lots of work to get my body back into shape, but I can say to anyone feeling miserable and thinking this is life forever, that it is not.  Things get better, even if it feels like those setbacks are the last straw.  I don't know if you've ever seen a hay or straw bale, but there's no such thing as the last straw. 
So that's me this week.  You're all wonderful people. Keep those spirits high, even on the days where you'd rather be a peg-legged pirate =)

"Hi all my hippy friends and those of you who don't know me!
I am 63 and had my right hip replacement 10th June 2015 with Michael Cronin at Coventry Hospital with Superpath procedure.
In agony prior to that, very quick deterioration over a 6 month period - I couldn't wait to get in to hospital to have it done!
Superpath is a minimally invasive procedure with no hip dislocation prior to surgery, no muscle cutting, muscles are parted and very small incision.
Recovered well and quickly. Back to work  (I am self employed) after about 8 weeks properly but doing work from home before then.
My operated hip feels as if it is my own now - I sometimes forget I have had it done. No joint pain whatsoever. I rush around all day and am very active.
If anyone is out there worrying about having this operation, then STOP now. It will change your life. I was in so much pain before my op that I sometimes wondered whether I had the strength to carry on. I now feel so different, look better and am enjoying life once again. Constant pain saps your energy and pulls you down - there is no need to suffer, just put your faith in these wonderful surgeons and get it done.
Of course there is some pain and discomfort immediately post op, but every day gets better and you know that the pain is short term and controlable.
Still having physio, which is a bit intense to build up butt muscles and loosen psoas muscle which can be quite tight in hip patients. I don't do them as often as I should, but they have strengthened my balance and my walking pattern is good
My best wishes to all of you out there who are in recovery or awaiting ops.
I went into this experience prepared to enjoy it every step of the way, even the pain, because I knew that there was going to be a great result and I would be myself again at the end of it all. Be positive and don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. Much of your recovery depends on your attitude and determination as well as the expertise of these wonderful people who are so skilled in putting us back in one piece.
Kindest regards to all Linda xx

"For reference, I'm a 53 year old male who had a ceramic left hip fitted by Mr Ganapathi 25 days ago at Spire Yale hospital in Wrexham.
I had a review with the physiotherapist today that went really well, and am now down to just one crutch! I have followed the prescribed physio exercises religiously, and now walk briskly for about an hour a day. I am completely off all pain relief and feel, quite frankly, bloody marvellous!
Along with others, I had swelling of the leg, ankle, and foot of comedic proportions shortly after the op, but this was completely resolved by the end of week two.
I also had incredible pain in the groin (on the operated side) very soon after the op, this too has now completely resolved, and was put down to a pulled muscle probably caused by getting back onto the hospital bed without help the day after the op. For future reference, that's what the call button is for in your hospital room - ask for help!
Of course, the very best news is that all the preoperative pain is completely gone! All this, and just a 3"" scar.

I had very successful right hip replacement last September. Walking without crutches for several weeks now.
Around mid November, at around the same time I found I had no pain and decided to stop pain killers ( 8/500 cocodamol,  I started to get this cold feeling or 'tingling' at the base of my spine and sometimes up over my back and around the front of chest and abdomen.
No pattern as to when and where and varying from mild to intense and difficult to get on with normal life.
Three GP's have tested everything and are bamboozled.
Apart from that I'm fine.
I've got referrals coming up for orthopaedic dept and physiotherapist.
Saw chiropractor and he couldn't find anything to cause it.
Plan to ask to see Neurology dept if no progress soon

"I read on here that patients do not have any sleep for the first three days, post op because the nurses are checking their blood pressure every hour - presumably 24/7!  Is this usual?  I would be an absolute wreck if I had pain combined with three days without sleep.
If this is the practice with all patients, they must have one nurse running running around the wards checking all the post op patients' blood pressure!  
I am inclined to believe that this is only the case, with patients who suffer from hypertension or hypotension?  Or am I dillusional, and should resign myself to three days and  nights of pain and hourly BP checks?

"Arrived home at about 4pm completely knackered. By 5.30 I
needed to sleep so with the assistance of my lovely wife I got my head down upstairs.
For a few hours it was pure bliss. Then the pain set in again. As
Rocketman has so ably commented _ what we go through during the operation is pretty horrific and our bodies have to go through a lot of pain as part of the healing process.
Anyway, after a few hours II couldn't lie down upstairs anymore
(maybe the beds too soft) because it became too painful. So I
have had to come downstairs again. The painkillers they give you for use at home have timing constraints, whereas when
you are in hospital the nurse tends to give you something
whenever your pain gets too bad.
So as I sit painfully here on cushions on a settee, watching the
horror channel, desparately waiting for 4am when I can take
some more paracetamol, and desperately waiting to use the high rise toilet seat (haven't been since Friday) I cannot help but feel
sorry for myself. I imagine the pain this week is gonna be pretty
bad but that eventually the body will start winning the battle and
things will start to get better.On the plus side what I found useful
for us male hippies was a glass container which we use to put dry spaghetti in. It proved very useful on a couple of occasions whilst I was upstairs!

"I found this forum a couple of weeks after my op. I was looking for information on how to relax my thigh muscle, and I found so much help, advice and information here, I checked in most days.
I'm now fully recovered although I will be having my left hip done too shortly.
People often ask for information and experiences here - that is what the forum is for - but while you would think it would be cut and dried, its so difficult to gauge how individuals will respond to the operation. Every single person has had a different experience for whatever reasons.....maybe some had pre existing conditions but mainly I think it comes down to your particular surgeon, you're own personal healing capabilities, your fitness levels pre op, maybe even positive mental attitude has a lot to do with it.
In the end, if you're having it done, you will deal with it and cope, however it goes, there is no option.
I also would just like to add that the surgeons, doctors, nursing staff, auxiliaries all do a fabulous job - sometimes against all the odds. They are at work at all kinds of ridiculous hours for crazily long times and yet I only had 1 who gave me reason to moan to my partner - and looking back that was probably more because I was tired and frustrated than anything she said or did.
It's a fabulous operation that will change your life, and it's available free of charge in the UK, incredible! How lucky are we!
My advice?
Try to relax and 'go with the flow'
I, for one, will be eternally grateful for being able to go sledging with my young grandchildren yesterday instead of sitting watching the fun and games.
It will all be well in the end.....

"Hi everyone
I have not posted previously but I have been a frequent visitor tp the site for the last couple of months. Mindful of the fact that lots of group members are awaiting surgery, I have been spurred on to post to share my extremely positive experience of THR in the hope that it will provide reassurance.
I am a 49 year old solicitor running a busy practice in Staffordshire. I have always been a very active person - I have run a couple of marathons (possibly not showing enough respect for my joints in the process) I was diagnosed with bone on bone OA in July 15 and my condition quickly deteriorated to a point where I could not walk more than a couple of steps without extreme pain. With the approval of my surgeon I carried on training right up to my surgery on 4th December 2015, managing to cycle against moderate resitance on a static bike. 
I was fortunate enough to have am excellent surgeon and anaesthetist. I elected to have both a general and a spinal block and as I am a bit squeamish, they were kind enough to insert the spinal injection after the general kicked in. I suffered no nausea and was fully awake enjoying tea and sandwiches within a couple of hours. I walked to the bathroom that evening and progressed straight to crutches the following day. I was discharged after 3 days and was comfortably able to undertake a 45 minute car journey to see my disabled Mum and walk around a department store 2 days after discharge. I have been lucky enough to have only a few disturbed nights. I sleep very well generally and with a strategy of plenty of pillows and a faux fur stole to ease pressure on the heel of my operated leg, I have slept consistently well which has been a big help. I took my painkillers as prescribed for 2 weeks, paracetamol for a further week and then nothing after week 3. I am not reckless and certainly no hero but I simply have not needed anything more than ice from time to time.My husband has been a wonderful support - a total star, and not having a young family I have been able to focus on regaining my strength and function.  I felt well enough to go back to work after 4 weeks working shorter days which I am gradually building up. It is my own business so i have the luxury of decamping home if I get the frequent enery slumps. I have been undertaking physiotherapy once a week - nothing heavy and my therapist declared me safe to drive after 5 weeks. At 6 weeks I am walking tall, with no aids and no limp. I recognise that I am blessed to have had such a positve experience of THR and am supremely lucky to be looking forward to an active and painfree 2016.
Just two things to add;- I want to say a huge thank you to members of this forum, Rocketman, Rose, Renee and co for honestly documenting both their highs and lows for the benefit of all. Everytime I have had a twinge, faced a struggle or challenge I have been able to access the site for reassurance, tips or sometimes for just a humerous perspective on something that we are all facing. Secondly I would urge all prospective hippies to ensure that, within the confines of the painful limitations that they are all facing pre-surgery, they ensure that their muscles are in the best possible shape as this has undoubtably stood me in excellent stead in my recovery.
I intend to keep checking in and send my very best wishes to all fighting this particular fight

"I am beginning to see the wisdom of practicing sleeping on one's back pre op.  It may mean a couple of bad nights, but at least, over time, it will become the norm, and hopefully, the body will adjust.  My problem is that my Maine Coon, may leap on top of me.  She is a ""whopper"" so I may have to keep her out my bedroom for the first few nights, post op!  I have read websites that say that it is possible to sleep on the unoperated side, with a bolster between the legs so that the operated leg is kept in the right position, but again, the wisdom of this is up for debate.
Ear plugs sound to be a good idea, to screen out any background noise, and my Kindle will be a good ""screen"" with earphones, of course!
I am, of course, pre op, so do not fully understand what is considered to be the ""norm"" in terms of patients' expereinces for the first few days in hospital post op.  It rather looks as though a lot of post op care and monitoring depends on the patient's  general state of health, pre op, and any extenuating medical circumstances that require extra care and vigilance.  
I am ""psyching"" myself up for almost anything, at this point!  I do not do well without at least seven hours' sleep per night, and it does sound as though sleep deprivation whilst trying to recover in hospital is a necessary ""nuisance!""

"Hi everyone
Yesterday at 2pm I was taken to the operating theatre at BMI
Sandringham for my hip operation. I am now officially a member of the hippy club. These are my initial thoughts which may be of
use to those who are due to have their operation.
Firstly, the staff of BMI Sandringham are all highly efficient, caring
people. This ranges from my surgeon, Dr Sunil Nair, to all the
nurses who looked after me so well. So hopefully you will
experience the same care at the hospital where you are having
your operation.
Secondly, I had an epidural as part of the prep for the op and I
was also sedated. What an experience. To be paralysed from the waist down for about 5 hours is a very scarey experience. It
makes you appreciate how lucky most of us are.
Thirdly, when the spinal effects wore off I wasn't prepared for the pain I was about to face. I have a low pain threshold so started to feel the pain from my 'war' wound quickly. Last night I lost count
of the different painkillers that were given to me ,and still as I sit
here waiting to try out a Zimmer frame I am still in severe pain.
This, together with the plastic bags that inflate and put pressure
around your ankles every 10 seconds (to ward off blood clots),
and regular visits from the lovely nurses to check your blood
pressure means you could be devoid of sleep in your first night in hospital.
I have been told that after the second day everything gets better.
Good luck and best wishes to my future fellow hippies.

"Hi hippies
I was supposed to try walking with the Zimmer frame on day 2.
Putting your legs over the side of the bed is hard work and when
you eventually raise your legs back on the bed you will be gritting your teeth. The Physio has to be sure that you will not faint when using the Zimmer. I did try a couple of times, but the effects of all the
different pain killers had left me feeling very sick so the most
they got out of me yesterday was sitting on a chair for an hour.
That is progress though.
I managed to do a bit of cat napping last night. I find it hard to
believe anyone can get a decent night's kip what with all the
checks the nurses have to do.
It is now Sunday afternoon and I have passed the Zimmer test and
am about to try out crutches going up and down stairs. Pain is
now moderate, not severe!
Hopefully at about 3pm I will be going home to continue with my
recovery.
So my message to all future hippies is to expect an
uncomfortable couple of nights but then it definitely gets better.
All the best friends!

"I had my right hip replaced 7 weeks ago. The plan was to do the second one in April but it has deteriorated so badly and rapidly due to AVN that I am in horrible pain. When I saw my surgeon this wk for 6 wk check, we talked and decided to do it sooner--- next week!! I am(mostly) happy about this. My hemaglobin and other blood work is good and my ""little systems"" at home (commode, grabbers, walkers etc.) are all in place for recovery.
That said, I am not feeling casual about such a big operation so soon. I think in some ways it might be easier because I will have a good leg to help the operated one-- which I didn't this time-- but I am not wanting to overlook anything that might not occur to me. I'm wondering if anyone has had the second one done so close together and what your experience has been. Any thoughts? Thank you all. I so appreciate this forum. Gail

"Just thought I would post on these car seat cushions that swivel to allow easy access and raise the height of the driver's seat so the the 90 degree rule is adhered to.  There are quite a selection ranging in price from about ｣10 on up, on a well known online site.  They would come in very handy when the six week rule against driving ends, and post oppers are still a little apprehensive about getting in and out of the driver's seat.

"Hi all, ive started having physio on my leg and couldnt believe how weak it has become. Guess ive been protecting it and using my good one without realising?
Basically she got me to lay on my back and lift my bum off the mat using each leg. My right one did it fine but my left just started shaking.
Shes given me some exercises to strengthen it so hopefully will help.
At the moment im still going to the gym just cycling and some light exercises but im worried im going to make it worse?
My limping seems to have got alot better and the pain is quite light. Only time it gets painful is if i rotate my leg inwards or outwards...then it feels if ive been shot.
I know its going to get alot worse over time but is this normal?
Thanks Scott

"hello fellow hippies
laying in my hospital bed I just realised it was 9 months ago ( April 14 th 2015 ) since I had my left hip done. I can't really say wether I have really benefited from having it done but it has managed to take a lot of the strain since my right hip collapsed. Only getting a few niggles. But maybe that is because I am on so many meds for the pain in right hip. 
Please keep fingers crossed i get I get my hip done thie Tuesday. I am in agony and can hardly walk now after being forced against my better judgement to walk way too much round the ward.

However I started  pilates last week and whether it is coincidence but I have started getting a pulling and aching sensation in my operated leg. The same feeling I used to have before my op, a heavy dull ache which means I have to take the weight off it. Has anyone else experienced this?  I'm praying this is temporary after going through all the pain of the on and the recovery. Thanks for any replies to this...

"I have a hit abit of a wall. This week back to my usual routine on my own of getting up before the birds, cleaning house, washing, cooking and get the children to and from school. I literally can not move with exhaustion. I can't even speak I am so tired...I have had to go to bed today.
Is this normal? I typically have a full on start from 6am to 10am which is non stop ~ and nons stop again 3pm to 8.30pm or 9pm. In between I was hoping to go for walks, exercise and get things done, as I am not working at the moment (goodness knows how I would do that as well) but I am feeling floored by the time I scrape through to 10am.
Still have mixed nights, as I can't sleep on my side or move all night, lying stiffly on my back until check up. I am waking most nights, not the end of the world, but wouldn't expect to feel this level of tiredness.
What levels of rest did you need at this stage? 
Did you need to rest a lot?
Am I doing too little, too much? I keep trying to force myself to do things and then my hip starts to really hurt, as well as the fatigue. I am feeling worried that I just cant get anything done, and am wasting my recovery in a chair. I don't want to see my friends, or go anywhere. I just want to be at home. I don't think I am feeling down, I feel okay just really really worn out....I hope it will get better....I thought by now I would be really doing so much more (running theme I can see) but I really did think I would be more or less back to normal.

"Well it's my 12 wpo anniversary today and feeling good on the whole. I have been gradually increasing my walk distance(with crutch) and am up to 50 minutes now walking uphill and down every day. Almost lost the penguin without the crutch. I went swimming today for the first time and was able to breast stroke without any problem. The  op hip is far more comfortable than the ""good"" hip although the top of the hip/pelvis gives a bit of gyp after sitting down for a while but that seems a common problem for hip oppers. Isn't it?
The problems that are still with me though are firstly my op side is still very lumpy and uncomfortable if I try to lie on that side. We all get the golf ball effect but is it normal for this to go on for 12 weeks.
The other problem is that I still cannot stand and balance on the op leg without discomfort and having to hold on to something or put the other leg down.
What do you guys think.

"I have been in pain off and on for about 5 years now and xrays show that i have greatly reduced and/or missing joint cartiladge and bone spurs including bone cysts that seem to come and go. The Ortho surgeon said from the xrays alone, I needed a full replacement. Most days its painful to walk for too long or bend,  twist etc which does interfere  a lot with my life and i often find it hard to sleep or reach a deep sleep. Id love to travel but but can never tell when my hip will feel okish and when it will be agony!  Every day can be different! I have been told pain like this comes and goes and is all part of the slow deterioration of the joint. As my surgery date looms in the next week i am starting to feel maybe i dont need it  ( hip is feeling okish today!) or am i just getting cold feet?  Im mid 50s and pretty healthy and active but this hip has certainly held me back especially in the last year. Ive never had a big Op but some websites say sooner is better than later. Any ideas or thoughts?.

"I am fairly young, and have three young boys at home. About eight years ago I fell down a flight of stairs with the cute little blonde in the upper right corner of my profile picture About two months ago, I had a total hip replacement of the left hip. Then almost a month later had a revision due to infection. Since that second surgery I have had pain that radiates down the left leg and goes across the knee joint. It doesn't always go straight through the knee. However, it always starts mid thigh and goes straight down. I was discharged with home health and antibiotic therapy. That was DC'd yesterday. YAY!!! I am free. Well, I would be jumping for joy, but it hurts too much!! Has anyone else had this experience, or am I blazing new trails here? It is really starting to wear on me.

"Hey all. Sorry, I've kind of been around but not too chatty. Just thought I would let all of you know what's been going on with me. Well, I had the trial sympathetic Nerve Block and it did work. Yeah. Although my 8-10 nerve pain all over my left leg didn't go completely away. It went down to about a 4 or 5, and would get worse if I did stuff. But let me tell you, I can live with that!!
I saw my surgeon last week at my follow up to my block and he asked if I was happy with the block. Yes, yes, yes!!! And then he said he would order the next one with something that is going to last longer this time. That's where all the good news stopped. I have been asked this question by many Dr's, but always said that I have never been diagnosed, and I've always kind of thought that I had this, but the surgeon diagnosed me with Complex Regional Pain Syndrom/Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. He said sadly, and that nobody wants this diagnosis, but these injections have confirmed it.
That wasn't the end of the bad news. He wants me to stop all physio until I have the next injection, which is today, and see him a month after that, then he will assess if I'm well enough for physio then. The reason for my bad hip isn't the same as many here OA, I actually have Avascular Necrosis as a few others do as well. Well, I had an MRI because my knee had been hurting. And, well, I now have AVN in my right knee and suspect it to be in my left too. The surgeon said that he wouldn't be surprised if I actually have or will get AVN in many bones and joints as well. So, let's just say with a diagnosis of CRPS, which is rare and extremely painful and with the AVN which is also rare and extremely painful, I haven't been up to much in ways of posting here or doing much else sadly.
On a brighter note. I had my more permanent Sympathetic Nerve Block done today and I'm just waiting for my 2 hours after so I can go home. It took us 2 hours and 20 minutes to get here this morning which is usually a 50 minute drive due to the lovely Canadian weather. Due to this, they had to push my procedure back 2 hours. So. All I want to do is go home now. 15 minutes more, I hope. I will check back later when I get home. Thanks all...

"Very uncomfortable and demoralising situation to be in after having gone through the op and reached the other side!
May I suggest, what I had previously posted - sleeping n towels on top of sheets and pillows, and spraying them with something like lavender, which is a good sleep aid, too, or any other fragrance?  There are also body sprays that you can use.
I have not been through the op yet, so not really in a position to recommend, but this is merely a suggestion that may or may not help.  At the best, you will smell lovely when you get into a nice aromatic bed, even if it doesn't last the night!  Get up and do it again?  Don't forget to run your wrists under cold water to cool down the blood stream, first. 
 Potpourri in the bedroom, and incense, if you can stand it, in the hall outside the bedroom, may help, too. There are also the plug ins, if you can stand those.  
These are morale boosters at a time when you are not feeling your very best.

It is as well to be well prepared for these types of symptoms so that preparations can be put in place, such as towels to sleep on and towelling robes and ""smock"" type towelling (beach wear, possibly).  ##I am figuring that my surgery will take place May/June, just about the worst time of year for me, as I do not do well in humid, hot weather.

i had a visit this morning from my surgeons registra and another of his team.
i have had it confirmed that the room I am in is mine now till my surgeon can get me in theatre. Again all ops were cancled here today. So he is looking at doing me on Tuesday next week unless something comes up again. But he has assured me I am not cancled just put on hold. 
Preasure sore all healed and my surgeon does not want me to risk going home so the nurses who told me I would be going home were wrong. 
The he nurse who caused me issues
i had a meeting today with her boss my other 1/2 was here too because he witnessed the incident. The nurse has been removed to another ward and pending on what is decided between the CEO of the hospital and the area and ward managers action will be taken. But what action will have to be decided and they will let me know in the next 2-3 days. At least I don't have to feel uncomfortable  seeing her around the ward.

But the worst of it is when she corrected my posture has caused so much pain in my non operated hip, groin and back, it has left me in agony, I actually feel sick.
I have never felt so despondent in my life, she made me feel terrible, and finished by saying that I probably need a hip replacement for the left hip just like that! As if it was nothing. I felt slapped by that casual comment - given what we all go through it is not the best news, and I could have done with her breaking it to me a little more gently.

I have to hide in the loo when I get upset to avoid upsetting my girls but I can't even get there a moment!!!

"Hi HIppies
I am seeking your advice once again.  After seeing the nurse yesterday to remove my dressing at 10 days post op, she was very scathing about my recovery.  For example she stated that I should not be having any pain at all by now.  That I should easily be able to climb onto a high couch unaided.  
My wound was sealed and clean, no problems there.  I am climbing very steep cottage staircase 2-3 times a day, walking round the house on crutches and doing all the exercises I have been given,  but I still have pain and take painkillers.  I came away from the surgery feeling like a failure and worried that I am not making good progress. I wondered if you could tell me how long your post op pain lasted.

I had an xray which isn't routine at 6 weeks, I was so worried something was going to show up that was negative. The surgeon told me because I have a large "" high off set "" implant he wanted to make sure there were no fractures to the bone- thankfully there were none!  I mentioned the "" clunking"" sensation which I have experinced on and off since the operation. He wasn't perturbed said that sometimes people experience this but couldn't throw any light on the problem He just said the operation had gone well. I can lose the crutches, drive,  use a static bike , but more importantly get back in the pool!! Yay!  Front crawl allowed but no breast stroke for Another 6 weeks. I can start the advanced physio exercises and he will see me again in 6 weeks  The 90 precautions still apply until 12 weeks post op  best wishes to all Annie

"I have just found a profile of the consultant that I am due to see.  It states that he has carried out xxxx amount of THRs and half that amount; revisions.  I am not sure how to read this statistic.  Does that mean that he has had to revised 50% of his THRs, or does it mean that he has carried out those revisions on another consultant's work?  These numbers concern me, if it means the 50% of his work has had to be redone!

I will be going in for a RTHR on January 21st (very excited). I am trying to prepare as much as I can and have researched on the web. However, I am perplexed as to which side of the bed I should be getting in/out (stupid - right). Also, I have been recomended a ceramic hip due to my age. If you recommend anything else I can do to prepare, I would very much appreciate any and all thoughts/comments.

"Hi
I had my hip replacement 8 weeks ago and things have been good. Think I overdid walking up the stairs, as my muscle in back of leg burns. My scar also scabs and it I painful, it is sometimes difficult laying on it.
Is this normal?
I am being asked when I'm going back to work, but I work with autistic children, so don't feel ready yet. They makes me feel like I should be back, but I also have to drive half an hour which can also make my leg hurt.
Have any hippies got any advice.

"Good dayfrom a gray and icy Holland ,
I am a bit disappointed right now  (mildly expressed) as I seem to have hit a plateau in moving forward.
I had 2 THR surgeries in 2015 - Right hip in March 2015 and Left hip in September 2015 - 
I am very happy with the new hips and grateful that I didn't have any post-op complications - 
However .... first couple of weeks I felt great, confident, cocky even - It felt so good to not have that grinding bone pain anymore - 
Physical Therapist told me then to slow down a bit - to rest more , etc. Slow and steady and going well - Follow up visit with surgeon was an all clear - 
At some point my ""old"" new hip started to hurt - pain in groin, thigh, knee - almost as if it was too much to handle the newly operated hip ...
Since then progress has been so sloooooow .... Stiff and tight muscles, noticed that I am hunched over when standing... after walking or coming back from shopping etc. I can barely move -  leg lifts are painful which also makes me feel insecure about driving - I have to lift my left leg (Holland) into the car ...
my question to 2 THR surgery hipsters, do you recognize this - My first right leg is as sore as my left one - difference between them is 6 months and I know that it didn't get a chance to heal ... but still
Don't want to freak out anybody here who is about to have their other hip done --- it IS a wonderful feeling to have 2 good hips ...
big warm hug

"Hi everyone, I had a complex THR with bone graft just over 4 weeks ago. I'm none weight bearing for 6 weeks, then partial (toe touch) weight bearing for another 6 weeks. The Physio i spoke to in hospital said because I'm relatively young (45) and quite fit I should be probably looking at 4 weeks of recovery once fully weight bearing.
I've only just started to wonder what this will involve, I presume I'll be on crutches for a little while but as my hip will be healed will I take as long to recover as anyone else starting to walk after a new hip or wonder if it will be quicker? I know my op leg muscles will be weak and I've now got a longer leg (almost the length it should be) to deal with.
My friend is encouraging me to take a holiday to recuperate. It will be about 2 weeks after I start fully weight bearing. I'm also aware I'll be having Physio then but don't yet know how often. Would love to go away!! We'll only be relaxing!
Any advice would be appreciated

Firstly, thanks for all the good wishes
As most of you will , the revision failed
I had TWO surgeons working on me, but they couldn't budge the pesky ceramic insert
Looking at it with eyes instead of xrays, they decided it id only rotated, not sitting unsupported, so decided not to push their luck as there was a danger of busting my pelvis
So now it's back to leg inflators, physio, normal recovery stuff.
Only problem right now is my bladder says ""Go"" but my brain says""No"", not on bed!
Thanks again everyone
Best wishes

"I had my followup this morning, and my doctor put me through my motions and after looking at the xray (which was perfect), he said my woes are definitely from my psoas tendon rubbing against the edge of the cup end of the prosthesis.  Sitting, standing or laying straight.. stairs, getting in/out of cars, all a miserable experience.
Fancy Title: Psoas Tendonitis
We went through my daily routine etc, and he suggested an injection right into the tendon with ultrasound guidance.  He said 90% of the time that knocks it right out. If that doesn't work tho, it'll be back into surgery again to release the tendon, which will 100% solve the problem.
Here's hoping the ""needle doctor"" is as good as my doctor claims he is =)
Aside from that, things are going well.  I don't use the stick at home anymore, and was encouraged to take it with me when I go out, but not use it while indoors at the store etc.  My socks still evade me, and I have a ways to go in regards to strength and the such, but I am slowly getting more flexible and comfortable with life in general.

Each day there are noticeable differences that amaze me. I was released the day after my procedure and carefully walked up the stairs in my home just fine. I only did this to get to my bedroom and have no plans of going downstairs any time soon. I have help, which I believe is necessary at first. I wouldn't advise anyone to think they can do this alone. I wanted to thank everyone who gave me great advice and that little nudge I needed. I look forward to long hikes with my young son this summer.

"Slightly over two years agao, and after being advised that my arthritis was moderate to severe, I opted to try the physio route, and was given a series of exercises that included stretches.  I have followed them, but with some lapses.
I am wondering if other hip patients have been down this route, and whether or not they kept up with the exercises, as far as was possible, right up to the time of surgery, and whether or not, they found that the exercises aided recovery post op?  Also, was the surgeon aware that physio had been prescribed and maintained, and what was the surgeon's opinion with regard to the exercises as a form of exercise in maintaining flexibility and strengthening the muscles, pre and post op?
My last xray showed ""mild"" arthritis in the other hip.  I immediately bought Krill oil, and have been using it for about a week, and have started working the other hip as well, in the hope that this combination will keep progress of arthritis at bay, or at least delay it for some considerable time, so that I an finally get some exercise and enjoyment from my life!

"Some of you have been following me with my hip replacement woes.
It has just occured to me this morning rather than re-doing the hip, can they cut the 10mm out of my femur closer too my knee and below the steel spike of the prothesis.
Straight foward carpentry really, then they would only have the leg muscles rather than the hip and buttock muscles to tighten up with physio, and no or very little chance of dis-location, that is a high risk if they now try to shorten the leg at the hip joint, all of the muscles and tendons have ben stretched.
Just a thought, might run it past the specialist, he can only laugh at me.

Not the nicest thing to say to someone who hasn't exercised in a while! The other says hell no get your crutch back out and start using it ?!!
Why all the conflicting advice? Surely there must be some joined up thinking in the world of physios what is right...surely after so many years of research and patients, there MUST be a considered opinion as to waddle or not to waddle.

Sometimes it gets so I can hardly walk.... Sometimes I feel like I can feel the the rod or whatever it's called in my thigh.  At the top of thigh.  I am trying to rest more.   My therapist says this is normal with healing. I don't know.  Anyone else have this happen during the healing process?  Will this go away?  Two weeks ago I had hardly any pain and discomfort.  On December 23rd another therapist told me to try to wean off the cane. Since I started that this is happening.

He did make comment, natural leg length discrepancy should have been indentified before surgery, DUHHHHH????
He also admitted there is a link between LLD and sciatica, just the opposite to what I was told at the hospital, dooo they really think I'm an idiot and don't have access to the internet.
I was armed with article from Leeds Ortheopedic unit, available on the internet, and I showed it too him, he confirmed he had read the same article, and said good girl at least you are educating yourself.
He has then ordered up an MRI, and re-booked me to see him again 14 Jan.
He did his best to say there must be another answer to helping you with your problem other than re-doing the surgery.
I pointed out to him I have been doing my post surgery exercises in the swimming pool to the best of my ability for 11 months now, when I got the feeling to was going to say to me about visiting a physio, that put paid to that idea, what more does he want me to dooooo to make myself better I don't know.

I am walking well and completing all exercises. My surgeon blew me off and I have another appointment with him in a few weeks because I don't believe this to be normal. Is anyone else experiencing these symptoms?

"I have just posted info re a study done in America on patients driving reactions before and after THR. It may interest everyone. It is being looked at by the moderator for some reason hopefully he or she will put it through. In the meantime I hope this will get through ok. This is from the Royal College of Surgeons
Driving
Your insurance company should be informed about your operation. Some companies will not insure drivers for a number of weeks after hip surgery, so it痴 important to check what your policy says.
Normally, driving should be avoided for the first 6 weeks and even travelling as a passenger is best avoided for the first three weeks (except for essential journeys), as getting in and out of a car can risk straining the hip and stretching the healing tissues. However, you should discuss this with your surgeon.
Before resuming driving, you will need to be fully recovered from your surgical procedure. You should be free from the distracting effect of pain or the sedative or other effects of any pain relief medication you may be taking. You should be comfortable in the driving position and able to safely control your car, including freely performing an emergency stop.
If you have an automatic vehicle and it is your left hip that has been replaced (assuming a right-hand drive vehicle), you may be able to drive earlier, but this should be discussed with your surgeon and would depend on your general health, medical condition and personal circumstances, including the views of your insurer, and whether you are a Group 1 (car or motor cycle) or Group 2 (bus or lorry) licence holder.
Driving - an exercise
After about 6 weeks, you might want to test your fitness to drive. Do this in a safe place without putting the keys in the ignition: simply sit in the driving seat and practise putting firm pressure on the pedals. If you feel pain, you are not yet ready to drive. If you feel sore afterwards, you may need to wait a day or two and try again. Only when you can put enough pressure on the pedals to do an emergency stop - should you think about driving again.
It is advisable not to restart driving with a long journey.
Driving - Notifying the Driver Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA)
After total hip replacement, you do not need to notify the DVLA unless instructed to do so by your doctor; however, it is important to follow your doctor痴 advice about driving. Higher medical standards are required for those holding a Class 2 licence, so for reasons of safety and comfort your doctor may advise you to delay driving further. You should also speak with your employer.
Ultimately, it is your responsibility to ensure that you are in control of the vehicle at all times and to feel confident that you would be able to demonstrate this if asked.

However, it has a crook handle, which I don't like. Has anyone tried chopping off a crook and replacing it with a more ergonomic handle (it's not a screw-on handle; would need to be sawn off)?

I've overcome the fear when I have a crutch or cane and a bannister but still can't manage without a bannister, for instance at a kerb when out walking.  I found the other day that I had to use my good leg first as I just could not bring myself to use bad leg first when I just had one crutch and nothing on the other side.  It wasn't a problem as actually I found it easy with the good leg first but am interested.  Also, how soon do people begin to use both legs on going up and downstairs.

"Has anyone any experience with Krill Oil?  It makes big claims about being beneficial for joint pain/arthritis, cholestrrol, heart, etc.  Apparently, a lot of athletes swear by it as it helps with pain and stiffness following hard exercise and workouts, particularly running and cycling, etc.
Claims have been made about already existing moderate/severe/chronic arthritis symptoms and pain.  However, I do not believe in ""miracle cures.""
I have ordered it in the hope that it will help with my second hip which already shows mild arthritis and morning stiffness.
Be interested to know how many people on the site know about Krill oil and have experience with it.  
My philosophy is to try anything that may help, and if it does not, at lease I have tried to help myself.

"To say that my medicine box is full would be an understatement. Over the last 18 months I have explored every form of pain relief available.
I went nuts on tramadol, sick on fentanyl, tried the uploaders (Gabapentin) and all the downloaders, steroid injections, wheat bags, tens machine and Flexiseq.
Each GP I saw had a new take on my pain and I attended the pain clinic who told me I probably had something wrong with my hips! I had six sessions at hydrotherapy (nice) and had some physio which aggravated everything.
 I have probabIy spent a fortune on trying to find something that worked along with many hours looking up new ideas on the net (oils, creams and the latest miracles!) eventually worked out my own regime and take strong co-codamol every four hours which just manages to keep me upright.
I wondered what other people are using. How are you coping with your pain and discomfort? What eases and what irritates?
In my experience nothing really works completely, bone on bone is beyond pain relief.

"Happy New Year Everyone! I was wondering if there are members here that have had a TKR as well as a THR? My TKR was completed 2 years ago on my right knee. My rehab from that surgery was pretty good, but never felt ""complete"". I mentioned to my PT often, that while my knee and quad muscles were uncomfortable, I was most concerned about what I felt was significant pain in my hip on the same side as my surgical leg. The standard response was that I should expect some hip pain, and that I was most likely just referencing my knee pain to my hip.
I completed my rehab, but never felt my quad muscle was strong and dependable...and my hip pain continued. My doctors started me on pain medication and I was encouraged to ""put my big girl panties on and deal with it."" Over time, I began to depend upon a cane to help me walk...and seriously painful bursitis developed in my hip.
Bottom line: an Xray of my hip was finally completed...and it was discovered that my hip was indeed a mess.
My THR was on November 24, 3015...so I am approaching the 5 week mark. During week 2, I suffered an injury to my quad during a PT session (I wrote about that setback on this forum 3 weeks ago). My injury has necessitated my return to using a walker (I had begun using a cane comfortably at the end of my 2nd week of rehab, post THR) and I have been put on rest, elevation, icing and weight bearing as tollerated. It has been 3 weeks and I am making very slow progress and pain is still very noticeable to say the least.
Am I expecting too much as far as speed of recovery? Is the fact that I have a TKR on the same side as my new THR making things more complicated?
Any insights or info would be so very helpful! Thanks all...

"I am 51 and had a THR in December - not sure if the surgeon noted at the time I had hip dysplasia - it came to light in post op reviews of x rays. Anyhow surgeon has admitted he put the prosthesis in a bit ""tight"" to stop it dislocating. Result is I cannot walk upstairs without pain, have little rotation in my hip and consequential soft tissue tendenosis which cannot be exercised out due to ... stiffness and pain due to stiffness in the joint.
My surgeon has tried Manipulation under Anasethestic and hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, blood tests. Physios have said they cannot do anymore for me apart from massage and acupuncture needles (fell asleep in that session). Osteopath thinks there is impingement as he can put my hip under traction and get it to be a bit more mobile. But my surgeon who is a leading figure in the ROH Birmingham is proving to be slow to take a closer look at me. I am self employed and have not been able to work or be paid since 18th December and have no end in sight. I also have a leg length difference and the other hip is now referred due to hip impingement pain.
I have been very patient with the wait for out patient appointments, lost paperwork etc. But the MUA tested my hip not under load and with me asleep. The ultrasounds have been static - whereas the pain set on is after moving especially up hill or driving. At my wits end as I have had to stop all my sports - hockey, hill walking, climbing and sailing. Smacked out on maximum pain relief. Is there any advice from experts or anyone in a similar situation on what to do next?

"Hi all,
Seasons Greetings to all on this great forum.
As you may remember I had my hip replaced in May 2015 after suffering from post tramatic osteoporosis.  Well today I had a 7 month checkup and xray with my consultant - the good news is that everything is great and the bonding process (I'm uncemented as a relative youngster at 44) between the implants and the surrounding bone looks like it has progressed well.
The consultant seemed very happy with the progress and said he will see me in May 2016 on the anniversary of the op where he will hopefully be able to discharge me.
I can honestly say that on a daily basis I no longer even consider that I have had a hip replacment - I do get occasional pain in the knee or groin but nothing major.  I am able to sit however I want, can easily touch toes, do shoe laces and even cut my toenails (this seems like it will never be possible when you first have the op!).
So to all those wondering whether to go ahead or worrying about the op I can simply say this has transformed my life and hopefully it can yours too.  It really can be a life changing operation.
I have attached a pic of my new hip - titanium & ceramic!

I know it is silly but I worry about getting infection in my hip and what can cause it. I had op last June and everything seems to be going good - don't want to get an infection now! Do you think I should call the doctor and ask?

"Am now 22 days post-op (non-weight-bearing). Our shower is clogged and because of the holidays we can't get it fixed before Tuesday (without paying exhorbitant fees).
I would really, really like to take a bath. I don't have one of those bath boards and wouldn't feel safe on one anyway. Would it be okay for me to just jump in at this stage after the op? Have a mat right next to the tub so I wouldn't be stepping out onto slippery tiles. We don't have any grab rails, but our towel rack partially hangs over the tub so I could use that.

"Merry Christmas to all you lovely people. Had my pre-assessment a few weeks ago and now just waiting on a date for my TLHR.
Have to get at least two weeks notice due to coming off meds, hospital called twice asking to come in the next day coz of a cancellation which is frustrating as I keep telling them, it's not a choice, I've been instructed by the surgeon what to do medication wise.
Anyways, will be speaking to you all soon as I go through this op and hopefully recover well, which I'm worried about.

"Dear fellow hippies,
ive hesitated to talk about this but you, my friends, are the only people that I can seek advice from in confidence, and some of you may be able to empathise?
it all started to become problematic as my OA worsened prior to surgery, perhaps 9 months ago .... Having a proper relationship with my partner in terms of all things physical started to be an issue, I have to say more for him than me.  It was very painful and I didn't feel great about myself, having previously been very fit and confident.   Well, as you might imagine, things haven't got any better .... I've really been trying, since 7 weeks post-op but still awkward re positioning, and things came to a head last night when my partner said several things; he feels that I don't initiate sex, he can't remember last time he came home and I was wearing anything ravishing etc, etc.  I really would like to fulfil his and my previous desires, but quite honestly Im struggling to get back to normal in this regard.   It's 18 weeks post LTHR and I'm awaiting date for second hip which is very painful and restrictive.  
Has as anyone got any advice?

"I hve been able to schedule an appointment with a surgeon that was recommended to me.  He operates privately and also NHS.  I am NHS.  Appointment is not until mid January, and I am wondering, given that NHS is not adhering to the 18 week schedule, how long I am likely to wait for surgery.  I live in Wiltshire, but the surgery will be in Somerset.
I live alone and have no family, other than a daughter living in Somerset who does ot drive, so is unable to get out to here to me.  Usually I pick her up at the rail station, but will not be able to do that post op.  Other than that, I have absolutely no outside support.
Does my situation carry any weight at all with the NHS, or am I expected to manage on my own, both pre op and post op, and in growing pain pre op?

I'm now 15 days post op and had my dressing removed and staples out yesterday. It wasn't very pleasant as the scar area has always felt raw from surgery as a child. The scar is over an old one but a little longer, so happy as originally was going to have another (3rd) scar!
The nurse couldn't believe I no longer have any swelling and have no bruising. I have hardly any pain in the hip now which is unbelievable. Just wondering if that's normal at this stage or because I'm none weightbearing on that leg?

"I opened my purse a little while ago to give me daughter my ATM card to do some shopping for me. It was missing. I have had a decade-long habit of always putting it in the same purse pocket immediately after using it. I have NEVER put it on a store counter...
Until Monday this week, that is. Went shopping and must have put it down while wrestling with the shopping bag and the wretched crutches. Left it there.
I am so glad I realised today; the store still had my card in the service drawer and they allowed my daughter to collect it for me. If I hadn't realised until tomorrow night, it could have been a bit of a disaster with the banks closed for a long weekend.
Made me wonder what other stupid things I'm going to do now that I am focusing on standing upright between a couple of metal sticks, rather than engaging with what I've actually set out to do. Anyone else had these moments?

"I have just received my confirmation letter for my consultation with the surgeon.
It states that the specialist will; a) ask about my symptoms, b) may examine me; c) may request some investigations; d) will be done at the hospital/clinic, or be given a further appointment!
Is this the usual procedure?  It seems very ""iffy"" and surely, the xray would show how far the arthritis has progressed, and what the symptoms are likely to be!
The appointment is described as being that of a ""clinic"" and upon checking, I find that this is a block of time rserved for these types of consultations and essentially, several patients with my type of disease are seen within the allocated block of time.
I have had to wait two years, after being referred to a physio, who saw me, gave m a set of exercises, and that that was that.  Two years later, this year 2015, I had a further set of exrays that showed that the diseas, needless to say had progressed and was now shoing that I have arthritis - mild - in the other hip and the knee.  
Is it possible, that the specialist will reject me for surgery and expect me to go through yet another two years of pain and discomfort, or make a decision for other types of treatment, and in that case what would that be?
I find the entire scenario very unsettling and disturbing.  What is the experience of other members of the Forum in these types of consultations?  Do we have to be in a wheelchair and housebound before surgery, or what?

"I finally had my 2nd opinion 13 months after THR. The 2nd opinion doc said that indeed my new hip has increased my leg length by 5/8"". Noone said that before, not the original surgeon nor the radiology report from the full standing xray. BUt, he said that women in their 50's who are fit are the highest risk group for having LLD. That is becasue we are more flexible and the way I understand it, the muscles must be 'looser', so to get that good tight fit, the length often has to be increased. Is this common knowledge - its news to me.

"Hi to all you amazing hippies,I salute and admire your courage .
The thing is I continue to be undecided despite following the forum for such a long time.
I have so many concerns.
This one may seem silly,but I wonder about the body rejecting the new hip.
The fact that this would be a foreign body inside my own body scares me,because once it is in there what can be done?
The reason I worry about this is that I experienced rejection of a foreign body when I was younger.
It was a coil inserted for family planning reasons which I believe my body attempted to throw out,my stomach jumped from side to side as though something alive was in there.Foolishly I persevered and kept the device in place until I became quite ill,ending up in hospital and the device was removed.
I believe it was the reason I needed a hysterectomy later on. Following this no hormone replacement was prescribed and I believe this was the cause of my osteoporosis.
The osteoporosis is another fear I have,the thought of my fragile bones being operated on is scary too .
Sorry to be such a worry wort,but would be grateful for any comments experience or advice.
Don't know what to do!
Best wishes to all of you

"So - last year I was on my way to do my Christmas shopping in west London when I got a phone call with a date for my operation at the end of January (although because of a cold I had my op at the end of February). I struggled through the day in pain ( wasn't using painkillers) and in a frightened haze about the future whilst trying my best to have a nice day with my girls. Yesterday we went Christmas shopping in west London. What a difference I shopped till I dropped ( not literally) had a pit stop and then shopped some more followed by cocktails. A wonderful day. When we got home I went on a long walk with my husband and the dog. It was only when I got to bed that I started thinking about how different it was from last year. Yes it was hard and scary and I had to put the hours in to get better but it was a lot harder living half a life. It's my birthday next week (55) and we are out to celebrate ( in a night club??!!!!) I may even chance a dance or two. Hope you all have a lovely Christmas and a pain free new year. May you continue to heal and may the newbies find the inner strength for the op and for the LIFE that comes afterwards.

"Well, today was my 1 month mark post-op.  I have met a few personal goals like being able to throw pants on and off in relative comfort, but fell short on quite a few as well.
My biggest set-back/woe has been some form of -itis in my groin/soas/tendon area that I have had since week 2, thanks in part to an over-eager therapist.  It's an awful spot to have hurt, as you use it doing pretty much everything where you raise your knee. 
My new therapist has taken me completely off of any exercises involving that area, which will set me back even farther since that's at least half of the exercises I was supposed to be doing. 
The body heals how it heals, but it's still a bit disappointing not being able to do some very basic exercises yet.
On the up side, she has asked me to stop using the cane around the house so I can focus on my gait and training my brain to stop guarding the hip now. We both had a good laugh at me trying to walk normal, which wasn't painful, but my brain wasn't having any of it apparently.
I hope everyone is recovering nicely, and remember to try not to over-do things for the holidays.

I had quite a large blood loss as my op took over 3 hours and needed a load transfusion, also my BP was very low until today. Seemed to have finally turned a corner and now practicing hopping on my good leg using frame, as I'm none weight bearing for 12 weeks. I'm half the age of the majority on the ward who all seem to be doing really well and most discharged home quite quickly. I've felt quite down at times, feeling ill never get anywhere and the pain is so bad as I'm having to hold my op leg up off the floor at all times. Luckily I've got good upper body strength so that helps.
I'm hoping to be discharged tomorrow and looking forward to it. I'm sat here now on a big busy ward listening to the most horrendous snoring going on all around me. Good ear plugs are a must!!!! As are baby wipes/hand wipes/drinks, as water doesn't always quench your thirst/lip balm is handy and snacks as you may not always feel like eating at meal times.

"Hi Everyone,
Was hoping to get some insight on the Direct Anterior surgery method.  I am 52 and in need of a total hip replacement.  I am very healthy, physically fit and active.  The pain has been ongoing for 4 months and I have determined with my doctor that it will never be the same again.  I am tired of the pain and limitations it has brought upon me.  My concern with the posterior method was the activity restrictions and recovery time.  The anterior method suggests quicker recovery and less restrictions.  I live in South West Florida and there are only a few doctors who practice this newer procedure.  I would appreciate feedback and comments on this topic.

"I had my RTHR the end of February of this year and all went great! At my 2 week appointment, I told the surgeon, let's go ahead with the other side. He slowed me down a bit and I had it done the end of September. I don't have OA, like many around here do. I was diagnosed with a rare condition called Avascular Necrosis. I've met a few people on here with it as well. It's where the blood supply to the bone gets cut off and then without blood, the bone dies. They say it's second in pain to bone cancer and just as destructive. It tends to happen in younger people. So, at 38, I had my second hip replaced. Before my surgery, my surgeon warned me that since I have nerve damage in that leg already, it may become worse. And as he had to lengthen my left leg by over an inch, that was another concern as well. But I really had no choice. I had a general with a spinal and as soon as the spinal started wearing off, I knew that his warning had come true. The pain was unreal. No amount of pain medication touched it. The morning after my op, I asked him to amputate or sedate me until it was better. My normal nerve pain was in my groin and down the outside of my thigh. This was my entire leg. My surgeon refused to do either of my suggestions. Lol! Fast forward 10, almost 11 weeks and my pain is still really bad. I actually got fired from physio yesterday. They said there is no sense coming back until my pain is more controlled. I agree with them. Anytime, anybody or anything, clothing anything touches me, my entire leg is in incredible pain. The same happens anytime I engage any of my leg muscles. With having my leg lengthened, the surgeon, physio and myself were all concerned with my muscles stretching to accommodate my new length. Well, my leg really hasn't progressed much since surgery and the muscles are extremely tight now too. The ray of hope I have is, I'm having a sympathetic nerve block done on Tuesday. They are hoping that will kill the nerve pain. The only problem is that the one on Tuesday is just a diagnostic injection. Only temporary pain relief if it works. After that, if it does work, then I will have more that last longer. The surgeon said that there was no nerve damaged during the surgery, but just the stretching of the nerves were enough to cause all this to happen. So, here's hoping that Tuesday will be a good day with good temporary results! I read here and follow everyday, so I'm keeping up on how everybody is doing even if I don't post often. But know you are all in my thoughts and prayers.

"Hey all,
I had my left hip done about ten months ago since it was collapsed. Now I have a problem with my right hip which is not completely collapsed but it is about to. Unlikely, my right side giving me a sciatica pain and it kills me. I can tell myself the left and right femur length are completely different in the x ray. my right hip op scheduled on Friday, 4th of Dec. My doctor had told me that I need the op for my left side when it was collapsed, and now for my right side, he is recommending thr though, he asked me if I could lean on more. I don't think I can, even if I can, I don't want a limpng life with a painful sulky face. My question is to the ones who had the op on both sides and how are you doing right now ? If I have my unoperated hip done just like the operated and healthy one, other than the weakness of the leg, I believe I will much more quality of life, and mobility. What do you say ?
Thanks, Tolga

"Was just wondering what the ladies wore with teds stockings. Won't be going anywhere for a while but would like to look nice over Christmas. I've only worn joggers gym trainers up till now, as advised by Physio, due to better grip and as I'm not weight bearing on the op leg they are not too heavy on the leg I lift up. I have only been wearing one but would like something to wear on both feet if I do venture out, as its cold!
I'm a little bit fashion conscious, and probably over reacting!

" I have read many posts of people dealing with alot of pain after a total hip replacement then I have also seen posts that say they would of done it sooner if they knew the end results.
 I suffered from a torn labrum and had a hip scope performed in 2013, but that surgery was done incorrectly leaving me bone on bone. I was able to manage the pain with over the counter medications but was limited to what I could do. So I sought for a second opinion and learned that they suggested a total hip replacement. At the age of 43 you don't think of being impaired or limited of what you can do until it happens. 
 So I proceeded and had the total hip replacement done in October of 2014 and since then my pain level has become unbearable. I am stuck indoors because bearing weight on that leg causes even more pain. My injury was work related and thankfully after the work comp case was closed I lefted my medical open. 
 I have filed for social security disability because the likelyhood that I will ever be able to work again is very highly unlikely. I am constantly going to see a pain management doctor to control my pain with a high dosage of morphine. 
 Just recently went through another MRI and a full examination of x-rays trying to find what is causing the ongoing pain problem. But I have been told even with a hip replacement they can't get rid of all of the arthristis and quite frankly my suggestion to anyone considering a total hip replacement. Just wait till you can't stand it anymore, because you never know when what I have been through might happen to you. Life sitting at home taking medications to control pain is not a life.
 It was the opinion of one of my doctors that it might be ischial tuberosity pain, but I think they might have a dart board in their office that they are throwing darts at because I have been through numerous of injections, PT, and tests and still no new actual findings.
 Let me know if you have had similar pain after the fact. Thanks

"Hi I'm 30 years old and am in need of a THR however I can't decide whether to have the anterior (front) approach or the lateral (side) approach.  I have seen 2 excellent surgeons who each specialise in an approach and now need to make my decision (tomorrow actually) but am really torn and would love some advice.  
I am yet to have children and still have plenty of active years ahead of me so am wary of the lateral approach having a higher risk of dislocation whereas the anterior seems to be more stable because of less disruption to the stabilising muscles.  Is there truth to this?
I am getting married in January and would love to comfortably walk down the aisl and enjoy my honeymoon so the faster recovery that the anterior approach provides seems appealing to me but I have heard it can be riskier surgery overall.  
Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Suddenly, the most excruciating pain started inside my thigh (not wound) and groin. It was so bad it brought me to tears. Luckily the children were upstairs and they managed to get me flat in bed. I had something similar to this yesterday when I tried to move the pillow between my legs with the operated leg. The pain has subsided but I still have a dull ache inside my leg and a little discomfort at the site of hip bone. Has anyone experienced anything like this?

"I had my op almost two weeks ago. I didn't have a THR, but a plate and pin repair. I have my first hopsital consult tomorrow and have been wondering what, if anything, to expect.
Background: I never met the surgeon before the op, despite being told I would and that all would be explained then. I never saw a doctor in the hospital during the next few days and was sent home on day three with no advice, no exercises or even any instructions on how to manage safely with the crutches I already had at home.
While instinct says the surgeon did a good job, I'm underwhelmed by the whole hospital care overall, including on the ward. On the evening of the day of my op, I asked for a bedpan. The nurse did changeover and then went home without telling anyone I needed one. Rang the help bell for 15 mins before anyone came. It was too late by then and I'd been lying in a wet bed for more than five mins. The next day, I had a very brief, but very excrutiating short walk with a walker. When I got back into bed, another patient tried to get into my room. He fought with a nurse at the door for 15 mins trying to get in while I lay there in pain wondering what the heck I was going to do if he did get in. The nurse shrugged it off later as nothing. They gave me narcotics without telling me they were narcotics: ""it's just a painkiller; everyone on the ward is taking it"". They also came in at night, grabbed my stomach and shoved needles in without asking or telling me what was in the injection (have since learned it was an anti-coagulent; would it have been hard to tell me that?).
I hate the idea of going back into this hospital, so am keen to ensure I get well and fit and strong.
What should I be asking at this consult tomorrow that could help me get there?

Al was well, until PT on Monday 12/7/15. During PT sessiin, I was instructed to do a straight leg lift, with assistance from my cane, in order to get my operated leg into my bed. As soon as I lifted my leg and guided my straightened leg onto the bed, I felt excuciating pain. PT was alarmed. I was unable to bear weight on my operated leg. Met with surgeon. He diagnosed me with quadracept tears and soft tissue damage to ligaments and tendons on my RTH side. Now I am back on morpheme, back using a walker and PT has been suspended. Help!

Is this the norm?  So much contradictory info on thie site, I am finding.

do you think they look ridiculous, pathetic ? 
how do you judge them? and why? 
Please don't do this to yourself -
go out and take the cane with you, or whatever you need to make it fun and enjoyable - and if not, don't go out -   
this surgery is challenging and confrontational in so many ways -

"I have read a number of posts regarding symptoms post op.  They all seem to fit into a similar category, and that is a lack of knowledge of how the anatomy of the hip and leg work together.  I am going to do a search on the www to see if I can find something on there about the muscalature and nerves of the hip and leg, that may be of some help when symptoms of one sort or another flare up post op.  Hopefully, it will give reassurance to us all when these ""quirks"" make themselves known as our bodies repair post op.  
Also, there does seem to be a variation on how the first few days after release are managed and the level of assistance that is required.  I find these variations worrying, as I live alone, with no outside support other than what can be arranged independently.  I have a daughter, but she cannot drive, so would not be of any assistance, even if she could leave her work commitments and get here!  I am sure she will try to help, but her commitments are strong ones.
I am becoming increasingly alarmed about those first few days now, as I feel that I have been given misinformation on the levels of what the hospital would regard as sufficient competence to manage on my own before they will release me!

"I have just ordered a Wall Chart from Amazon:-  ""Joints of the Lower Extremities Anatomical Chart.""  This coloured chart shows anterior and posterior views of the muscalature of the hip and leg.  These include, muscles, nerves and ligaments, and is usually used by the medical profession to show their patients, graphically, where their particular problem lies.
I think this would be a very helpful chart to have in your pissession to refer to, so that you have a working knowledge of how your anatomy looks.  It should be particularly helpful if unexected pain or symptoms occur.  You canlook at the chart and identify where the pain is located  and then should the need arise, speak with your medical practitioner, describing your symptoms and where they are located.   
I think it would be very useful before and after surgery.  There are several of these charts available on the Amazon site, and I bought mine for just over ｣ new plus a couple of ｣s for postage.  Shoukd be here before Christmas!
I think this would be a very worthwhile investment, and may answer some of the mysterious quirks and twitches felt during recovery from surgery.

"Hi, I had my THR 6 days ago and just wondered if anybody had experienced similar problems with their spinal anaesthetic with sedation.
I was awake at the end of the surgery and could feel the stitching being done. More a sensation than pain but in the recovery area I could immediately move my unoperated leg and had excruciating pain in my operated leg. Was able to move this leg shortly after as well. Took a while for any pain relief to kick in and really shocked me, didn't expect to have any immediate pain until several hours after the op. Have to have my other hip done in 8 weeks time so praying the anaesthetic is stronger next time round.
It's quite a shock to the system having this surgery but have to say the information on this forum is brilliant.

"Hi everyone. I at home recovering from thp left leg from 3 December 2015 operation under epidural while being awake (cementless ceramic on ceramic).
My thr right leg was done 10 years ago (large metal on metal cemented)
Been doing slow steady progress at home but at night finding it very hard to sleep due to pain. Currently take 10mg 5ml Morphine Oral solution every 4 hours (4 times a day 2.5ml spoon) plus 2 paracetamol 500mg tablets at same time.
I stopped Tramadol 150 mg due to severe constipation and also the di-Morphine tablet (strong) which hospital gave me each night in hospital (which they never prescribed for home use).
Can anyone suggest sleeping tips or medication advice etc. I also find my heels get tender/sensation during the night also.
I have just removed compression socks as they were cuting into my toes and also demolishing my skin. I am continuing to keep taking the blood thinner tablets I was sent home with.
Also do most people sit during the day with bad leg bent or straight out in front of them? Or a mixture of both as and when appropriate?
My outer thigh muscle/skin etc on operated leg from knee to scar is very tight and numb in parts and painful. How long will this last? Do people use any hot water bottles/ice treatment on this area at all or is ths frowned upon or useless etc??
My surgeon is due to check wound tomorrow.
On a seperate note, I phoned the number that my hospital ward gave me on discharge, for me to ring some local specialist nurse clinics to have my clips removed at latest by 17 December 2015 but when they answered they said there service was already booked up until at least 22 December 2015 and all they could suggest was for me to try the NHS walk in centres at my convenience????
I know it is early days yet but any specific and/or general tips would be a Godsend for me, as my head is confused and my spirits are dropping at present.
Is it okay to sit up in bed with headboard and pillow behind me, to generally relax and/or sleep?
Anyway, many thanks

"Hello,
 This is my first ever post.
On Tuesday Dec 1st 2015 I had a THR in France (I live there). The operation went well and I was walking the second day after the operation.
On Monday Dec 7, the hospital said it was OK for me to go home, so I did.
Not sure what happened but on Dec 8 in the evening I found that it was very painful to walk forward on my operated leg (right) but OK to walk backwards! I went to bed and thought maybe I'd overdone it and it would be OK in the morning - but unfortunately it wasn't. I called the hospital and they asked me to come in straight away. When I got there they gave me an x-ray and found the new hip had dislocated - aparently this is quite rare.
That same afternoon I had the dislocated hip put back into position.
An x-ray was taken the next day and all looked fine and I walked a bit with the physio. They said I was OK to go home as all seems fine.
So now I am home and taking it VERY carefully when I walk about the house. 
The problem is that the new hip joint feels that it may be moving again and my right leg (the operated side) is quite expanded. I have the surgical socks on but obviously I feel very tentative.
I haven't looked into it yet but I'm thinking about going into convalescence home as I am on my own most of the day until the other half comes home in the evening.
Has anybody else experienced these problems I am going thorugh and maybe can offer a bit of encouragement as I am unsure how this is going to pan out?
Thanks,
Simon

"Hi, I had LTHR on Monday afternoon. Came home from hospital yesterday afternoon. I seem to be coping ok, no pain, exercises & walking with crutches ok. Only query I have 'is there any war to sit at a dining table without breaking the 90deg rule? 
If if anyone is considering whether to go have a hip replacement, I am 49 years old & have been in pain for 5 years not able to walk the dog, swim, shop or general housework. Even after 4 days I feel as if I have been given my life back. Wish I had pursued a hip replacement years ago instead of being fobbed off that my core muscles were weak & I needed to do strengthening exercises. By the time they got round to giving me an x-Ray my hip was bone on bone. Needless to say I had a THR within 12 weeks of the x-Ray.
This site helped me prepare enormously for my op. 
Hope all fellow hippies are doing well.

"I'm 44 yrs old and have mild to moderate arthritis in my right hip. I've tried steroid injections with no relief. I have hip replace my surgery scheduled for this month, but am starting to second guess myself. My doctor is the best in the area and has told me I am quite young for the procedure. He called me this morning to check in with me and reiterate that this isn't something to be taken lightly (no kidding, really?) and just wanted to see how I was feeling about my upcoming surgery. I must admit I am scared and wonder if I should wait. But wait for what? For the pain to get even worse, until I'm one of the folks that using a cane to get around? My pain is most pronounced when I attempt to do anything more than day to day activities. If I want to walk around the block or go run with my son, forget it. If I want to go hiking, forget it. What kind of life is that. My son is only seven so I need to be more active. Any thoughts? Thank you.

"Update time from yours truly.  Today was my 3 weeks out day, as well as my 2nd visit to Physio.
Surgical pain is almost completely gone, and I am only really taking my stronger pain relief at night, as sleeping is still tough for more than 3-4 hours.  It is nice having the focus back in my head, and worth the increase in general aches from not being drugged up 24/7.
Walking has gotten more natural feeling. I am using a cane and find myself leaning on it less, as long as I don't over-do it.  Usually I go out 3-4 times a day, which includes 15 steps down, a nice 5-8 minute walk, and then 15 steps back up. A few short trips feels a lot better than making the incredible journey once a day.
Pysio is a definite challenge. I was really shocked at how weak the leg was along with the muscle tone loss, which I was expecting.  I have a flared up hip flexor issue (ow), so no exercises that irritate that, but everything else is ok, if sore from the phsio routines.
My current nemesis is the clam shell exercise. I had a posterior approach, so that works the spot right where the muscle was cut. I'm going to beat it into the ground.. but for now, I have to settle with almost being able to lift my thigh off the pillow.. almost. lol
One thing my therapist shared, that I found wonderful. It's a focused ice massage to use over my hip flexor.  It is a deeper, more focused treatment, where as an ice pack is more generalized.   
Anyway, you just take a dixie cup (small plastic disposable cup) and fill it half full of water and freeze it. Once frozen, you just press it into your trouble area and rub in small circles.  It hurts cuz its cold.. then feels warm.. then will go numb. That's when you stop; about 5 minutes. It's a great relief for those painful spots ice packs cant seem to completely relieve.
This turned out to be a lot longer than I thought, so that is that.  Overall, it's been a pleasant week, and I'm looking forward to the next 7 days.

"I have already posted that my GP is referring me of THR following a telephone consultation.  My understanding is that the GP is going to dictate a letter referring me on.  I have no idea where the letter goes.  GP has advised that there will be paperwork for me to fill in, and I will be sent a list of hospitals form which I can choose.  GP says that I shall have to have an ECG but I have no idea who to contact, or whether they will contact me.  GP has also stated that I should have a blood test, but did not say where I was to go.  I am assuming I should contact the practice?  Right now, I am feeling very anxious and in limbo as I don't have the full picture, and I have heard and read some rather alarming stories about UK hospitals.
I have had little experience of UK hospitals, other than when my Mother was taken in at age 98 after flu became pneumonia, both of which she survived, and was given a dose of what I believe was diamorphine, that put her into a coma, resulting in her death. 
Perhaps the Forum could fill me in on what to expect from this point on, please?

"I am 10 days post-op, 63 years old and was reasonably fit (although less so as crumpled femoral head reduced all exercise exept swimming the past six months.) I thought I was prepared for this but I am starting to think there should be some more motivation and energy dribbling in by now. I have good support. I can shower and dress myself except for long socks but then I don't really want to do much. Read, watch TV, write a few thank you notes. 
I have a two story home and only go downstairs 1 or 2x/day.  Most walking done with walker upstairs from room to room. I am doing my sets of exercises 3x daily. Pain is not totally gone but I have another muscle disorder too (polymyalgia rheumatica) so it could be that. When anyone comes to bring a meal or good cheer I feel it is hard to hold up my end of the conversation. I am taking Iron although my hemoglobin wasn't too bad.
MY QUESTION is: does my experience seem normal range to you or is there something I should be considering. Sleeping about 6 hrs total with a trip or two to the commode. 6 hrs is about my limit with sleep so almost normal there. 
I think I believed I was going to speedball through this a bit and now my body is saying. No, I don't think so. Discouraged a bit.

Additionally, surgeries are being cancelled at almost the last minute.  Are patients given reasons for the cancellations?  Do the patients ask, and if they do, what are they being told?
I understand that the NHS is about to bring in 11,000 doctors and nurses from the EU to make up the shortfall.  However, they are not checking their credentials to ensure they are properly medically qualifieid!  Does aonybody know anythng further about this?  I find it rather alarming.

Well Feeling depressed and in pain I told her my story of my hip not being right since it was replaced in Feb, and being duck shoved by the junior staff at the public hospital, insulted, and told blatant lies, that I have been able to disprove the moment I got home. and I also said I'm sure the surgeon who did my replacement would be horrified if he knew about it, talk about right words, as she knows my surgeon, and has arranged for me to see his fellow brother surgeon in  private practice first week in Jan. She commented that I am not right, even she can see that. Hopefully some progress, will keep you informed.

I'll continue with PT for another four weeks on an outpatient basis.  But I am very happy with the results since I was in so much pain before because of my leg length discrepancy.  I am still in recovery, so I will continue to take pain pills as needed.  I'm the first one to admit I don't handle pain well!

my concern is Monday morning woke up with more pain than usual when I started to walk ( walking with cane past week) I could feel something clinking, not in the joint but on the outside of my leg, I don't know what that bone is called. Anyway as I take a step it clicks about four times, I can feel it with my hand, it doesn't cause pain but what could cause this.
Also when I woke yesterday ( I have a tendency to want to stretch when I awake and have tried not to do this since the operation) well I did stretch and I felt my hip joint move but no pain and no pain when I got up.
should I be concerned about these things or am I overreacting?

Surgeon emailed me yesterday that my leg is 5-7 mil longer. I need the other one down the road and he will equal then. To me my recovery pain is taking longer because how can't the body hurt when it is out of line...anyway I am taken with sadness today because my daughter who is 18 has been my caregiver and she has been a true angel. Sat . night she had chest pains and I sent her to emergency and they diagnosed her with periditis. My sister is taking her to her usual doctor for me today and I am unable to take her and it truly breaks my heart. she needs me now and I am not up for the job. I can't even put into words how sad and frustrated I am over this. I want the positive and prayers for her not me....thank you all. Savy from Canada.

"Hi all, I'm 11 post THR on my right hip, I had a ceramic on ceramic joint, wasn't told if it's cemented in or not. I seemed to recover well initially and did regular exercise and followed the rules to the letter. At about week 7 I slipped down the bottom stair at hope and landed with a thud on my bum cheek of the operated side. I rang the GP who didn't seem at all concerned ,i do feel this set me back a couple of weeks as my bottom was very sore and bruised. Since then I have seen my own osteopath, as the NHS hasn't provided me with any follow up care! He is massaging certain muscles and has given my personal trainer lists of exercise to help build up the muscles. I am 51 and relatively fit. I did attend the gym prior to my op but have been very good and started back at square one. But now I'm wondering I'm I'm pushing myself too hard. I swim and do pool based exercise one day and gym bases exercise the next. I walk every day too. I am overweight and have put on 8lbs since my op, so very keen to lose this extra weight. How much exercise is too much? I'm back at work next week on a phased return, but my hip still feels weak and sore and when I'm tired I limp. Could I be overdoing it and asking too much of my new joint? I couldn't live without co codamol now and I was at a stage at week 3/4 when I don't need them. This is worrying me a bit. 
Any advice would be well received.

"Just a little lesson learned story from me.
Nov 4th was my 14 day check-up post op.  The PA gave me the thumbs up to ditch the TEDs, said my scar was healing nicely, and referred me to physio.
Later that day, I was talking to my Physio, and she was happy with my gait using just my cane.  I was still really wobbly without, so was told to keep using it which was fine. I had zero inclination to do otherwise.
After that, we went over my exercises. The heel slides and thigh flexes weren't needed anymore, and added 4 new ones to my list.  In particular the standing forward leg lift and standing knee lift pinched a  bit.  I informed her of that, but she said it was okay and just changed my reps from 10 to 3.  Everything else was just muscle weakness and a good kind of sore.
I took my new routine home and the next morning everything went well, with the exception of the 2 exercises that pinched. I did them as instructed, but by the 2nd exercise of the day, I went from pinching to straight ouch.
I knew they didn't feel right, but did them anyway, because a therapist knows their job, and who was I to doubt when this was my first time having a joint rehab'd?
So now, 3 days later I've taken those out of my routine, which I just started again today after giving my poor tendon (my guess anyway) 2 days off with a healthy dose of ice and upping my pain med, which was down to twice a day.
My lesson learned is that my body knows what it's talking about, and that sometimes aggressive therapy isn't the best if I don't listen to it. I plan to let my therapist know I am dialing back, even if she doesn't think its the best idea. 
Another week and my scar should be healed over, which will mean switching from the hospital therapist to an actual facility and hydro therapy, which I am very excited about.

However, by the time I got a letter offering an appointment in 13 weeks, I felt the problem had resolved, so didn't take up referral. That was a month ago , then last week doing a job at work that required clambering around some metal frames and I over stretched muscles around new hip! Back to leading with right leg upstairs.... Just a cautionary tale that despite those around you thinking your all better... it actually takes as long for muscles to recover as you've had duf a hip and not used them properly for.

"I asked my surgeon whether what I had seen on this site about not doing the breaststroke when swimming. He said that whilst crawl and backstroke are preferable that there is no harm to be done doing the breaststroke after 4-6 weeks as long as you take it carefully and by the way use the steps to get in the pool rather than jumping into the shallow end.

"I have been referred on for THR - yesterday.
My GP has asked me to take a ""Baseline Blood Test"" at ""my leisure!""  She has never asked for this before, and I have been a patient of hers for over 10 years.  She describes me as being ""healthy"" during discussion two months ago about possible THR.
What I do not understand is why she would want this test and an ECG done so far ahead of surgery, which is not scheduled, obviously at this point.  My understanding is that these tests and  others are carried out about six week prior to surgery, anyway.
Any ideas...?

"This afternoon I had my 6week appointment with my surgeon and have asked a lot of the questions that have appeared on this Forum. Over the next couple of days I will post some of the answers which may surprise some hip hoppers.
I had been under the impression that it was best to dispense with the crutches ASAP. According to my consultant we should use crutches or a stick for another 6 weeks when walking out so as to get used to walking upright rather than penguin walking in the hope that it will improve. The muscles get used to walking that way and it doesn't encourage them to strengthen the muscles that encourage upright straight walking. It is ok to walk round the house without the crutches though.

"After delaying my surgery for ten years (out of complete fear)and waiting a year to see the doctor I had researched i am now three weeks post op. My operation was an Anterior aproach full replacement and I fell great. So good in fact that it has me a little concerned. I came home the next day with no movement restrictions and went up the stairs and into bed.
 The first few days were alittle groggie due to pain management but from day 7 on i am drug free and walking with a cane. Stairs are not an issue and i am in and out of a car (not driving) with now problems. A few days ago i over did it in my enthusiasm to recover and my leg became fatigued. Other that that most people dont event know i had anything done.
Has anyone else had this type of proceedure? I would like to know what to expect ahead and how far to push myself with out overduing it.

"I posted on the Forum that my third set of exrays were taken a week ago.  I called my surgery to order a repeat of my prescription and enquired about the exrays.  I was advised that the exrays were in, and my GP had seen them.
I was put through to a clinician who delivered the news that the arthritis in my right hip had progressed and there was further narrowing.  Hence, the more intense pain.  Was also advised that there was arthritis in my other hip and right knee.  This news came as a complete shock to me, and I advised the clinican that I was experiencing ""shock.""  At that point, I could not take in any more information.  I stated that I needed to end the call so that I could digest the information and come to terms with it.
I have now realised that I am essentially riddled with arthritis, hands and shoulders, at least.  The arthritis in the other hip has not been evident to me.  
The clinician advised that the GP had entered notes about referral, and that was that.
I called later, and asked if the surgery would read the report to me again.  I couldn't take in  the full information, much less take notes as the information was rattled off at such a rate,that I could not ask for clarification, and there was one aspect that I wanted to address. 
I was advised that I could speak to the GP by phone in the middle of the month, otherwise I would have to wait for an appointment until just before Christmas - just to have the results explained to me, and what the prgnosis and potential surgery was likely to be.  The clinician's ""bedside manner"" was notably absent when I advised that I was shocked to hear the results, such as they were. 
Later on, I spoke with my daughter and told her what had happened, and that I had not been given the opportunity to enquire about a peculiarity concerning my right hip, leg and foot.  She said that she had the same condition.
Overall, I found that delivery of the exray results were unsympathetic, and there was no degree of empathy or interest on the part of the clicnician in explaining to me the meaning of certain technical terminology, and she asked if I was unable to wait until I saw or spoke with the doctor, leaving me in a state of limbo with only the bare bones of of the findings.
Is this the experience of other members of the Forum?  It does seem rather callous to me.

"I wondered, you out there that are at my point or beyond, can tell me their experiences. I live in the country yet my road is highly travelled so Scarey to walk, no sidewalks and a long way to town, I walk around my house 15 minutes twice per day at each 5 minute interval I do 10 each leg lifts sideways, squat as tho sitting down and side steps around furniture, I am 63. I stand with weight on leg for 20 seconds twice. These are what they had me doing in therapy they sent me home with bands, I don't use those. I also do the leg lifts lying down as surgeon suggested. Problem is, I cannot get the muscle in the operated leg to not hurt. This morning not only is that hurting but it hurts down into side of knee. I read from some not as far along as I am that are walking miles and I can't even imagine that..should I push it and try to walk through the pain? Is this somewhat normal? Or should I be concerned, thank you. Any suggestions or reassurances welcome..

"I am 44yo female scheduled to have a total hip replacement via anterior approach Friday morning. I have never had any surgeries - not a one. No child birth no tonsilectimy nothing. To say I am terrified is putting it lightly. I am so paralyzingly scared I am having constant panic/anxiety attacks. I know I need this done - I was an active person before and now I am a sedentary slug. 
I want to be happy and pain free and healthy and active again but the thought of letting someone do this is terrifying. 
I am told immediately following surgery the pain will be less than it is now - I am trying to focus on that relief and begging God to give me the strength and courage I need to get through this. 
I appreciate all advice and words of encouragement from anyone that's been through this or is in my same position.

"I had a THR on Aug 10th. I can't seem to be getting over this surgery. I've been having severe rib pain from a possible rib fracture that probably happened about 8 weeks ago. Dr's are trying to figure out why this rib thing started. I feel like I'll never feel good again. It's been one thing after another.  A painful rash that lasted for a month, staples that were never removed initially and found 3 months after the surgery, nightmares and anxiety.  I think part of the anxiety problem is from  the constant pain and my fear of dislocation/infection. I was so surprised when the surgeon told me the precautions I would have to take for the rest of my life. Is it just me? How do you get on with your life? I'm 68 so not worried about anything real physical. Just want to stop worrying about doing anything to cause it to dislocate. I think once the rib pain has resolved I'll be better but does anyone else worry about dislocation months after surgery. Surgeon said everything looks good in the hip. I just want to move on with my life.

"I follow the posts on the Forum very carefully, and have noticed that a lot of peple are experiencing a lot of pain in their upper thigh, front and back, knee, calf, ankle, etc.  In fact throughout the entire leg and buttocks. 
Two years ago, my physio gave me a set of exercises, the usual program.  However, they include stretches that exercise the entire hip and leg.  What I am wondering is whether or not pre ops are still following the exercises, right up to the day before the op is due?  I am no expert, as I am still very much a ""beginner!""  But, something is telling me that it is very important to keep going on the exercises, right up to almost the last minute, because stretching and maintinaing those muscles that are not working correctly because of the bad hip, need to be toned up, so that recovery is not quite as trauatic post op?
I am wondering what the post ops have kept up on their pre op exercises, and if they have, have they found that the exercises helped after their ops?
I have a suspicion that it is a great temptation to give up on the exercises when discomfort becomes more intense, and it is felt that the exercises are no longer benefiecial?  What do you think?

I know that the 'Lightning bolt' of pain down the leg was OA, and I have not had that since the operation, but this front thigh pain is different.
When I go up or down down the stairs, I get absolutely no pain - but there I am putting weight more directly on the leg, it doesn't do much bending/extension.  As soon as I go to walk, the pain is there in the thigh when I put weight on it, and consequentially I limp.

"Almost 4 weeks since THR dressing removed at 2 weeks. All looked OK no redness or inflamation just a raised fatty patch about 3 inch long and 1 inch wide next to the scar. Which does not hurt but when pressed feels like a firm sponge and leaves an indentation where you pressed for about 2 minutes.
Over the last 2 weeks the patch has gone down a little but some of the firm spongy tissue has spread out and moved further down my leg below the scar. When this is pressed the indentation can easily be seen for a couple of minutes.
Just checking if anyone else has experienced this?

Had physio come round this Wednesday ,I was so pleased to see him,to find out if I was doing ok, he showed me some new exersizes and he was horrified at my stairs, (I live in a tiny flat on first floor on my own) My steps everyone hates, they have the most stupid tiles on you could put on the outside.He has forbidden me to go near them if its damp or wet.If I have to to make sure someone near.AAnyway we went for a little walk and it was fab outside . 
Im using 1 crutch inside and 2 outside as its quite uneven outside.
Last night I slept right thru, hope its not a fluke lol I seem to want to wee loads in the night lol

"It's great reading about everyone's transition from two to one crutch. I had my first physio visit yesterday and have been told I must use both crutches until advised otherwise by the surgeon at my six week check up.  Has anyone else been given this advice?  I'm a bit confused as everyone else seems to be throwing their crutches in the air and jogging round the block! I know I'm a little behind in my recovery as my mobility was even more limited due to blister, which I'm happy to report is 99% healed. Just wondering why I'm still on both crutches.

For example, donut cushions, etc., that are designed to take the presssure of certain areas of the body?    Does it perhaps, depend upon the skill and technique of the surgeon?

"Hi Everyone. I being admitted on 3/12/2015 for total left hip replacement after having right hip done ten years ago.
I am quite anxious as I worry about the future, in terms of my 10 year old right hip replacement and what if it starts to give me probs, and I will have a replaced left hip also soon?? I know alot of patients must have two replacement hips, so just wondered if any of you wish or can share your encouragement/stories etc? On a more immediate note, it still seems that advice is not to sit lower than 90 degrees or than waist etc after op, particularly cementless replacement hip. Can I ask how people got home from hospital if ambulance not provided? It is just I am feeling worried about dislocation etc and having to get into a car a few days after my op seems a bit of a challenge, particularly in relation to bending and lowering myself/my hip etc etc???? I would be really grateful for any advice specifically and/or general support/encouragement etc as I am beginning to crumble a bit emotionally and mentally as the 3 December 2015 draws ever closer!!!!!!! I am aged 57 and will be having epidural/spinal block and staying awake for op. Thanks & Take Care everybody, Best Wishes from Cuchillo

"Good evening to all my hippy friends
Hope you are are all getting there on your journey and in a good place at the moment
Where have these last 5 months gone? It was May when I joined the forum, had my RTHR on 10th June and the rest is history!
Just thought you might like an update on how things are going -
been back at work now for 3 months and can do more or less anything I want to - my hip feels as if it is my own. Been signed off by my wonderful surgeon and don't need to see him now till my year post op is up.
The difference my THR has made to my life is miraculous. I am so happy with the outcome
I am now having more intensive physio which is hard work but apparently very important to avoid problems with the hip long term. I can feel my hip getting stronger all the time - people who were used to seeing me hobbling around with a stick are amazed at the difference in the way I now walk. Still get a few aches in the muscles from having to retrain them - apparently I have been using the wrong muscles to walk with for years,but no joint pain whatsoever.
To anyone worrying about having this op, all I can say is to go for it and get it done asap. I was in denial for some months but I can honestly say I wish I had had it done sooner.
I feel and look so much better now that I no longer have that awful pain that drags you down
This op is life changing and will give you a bright and happy future
Just be positive, be prepared for some post op pain which is manageable with pain meds, rest, eat well and take your time. This isn't a race and everyone is different. Every day is a new day and you will show some improvement all the time
Good luck to everyone
Kindest wishes Linda xx

"Just read an extremely worrying post that states that post op on the right hip, as in my case, you are not back to driving for an entire two months.  No way, can I live like that!  To get out of here I have to drive across a bridge fording the Avon/Kennet canal.  There are buses, somewhere in the far distance, but I don't see the point in loading down with shopping and lugging it all back on a bus, and then having a nice long walk, loaded dow with shopping!  Delivery services or not, there are some things, that I need to see and examine before purchase!  
I haven't used a bus since I left San Francisco, and do not particularly want to start now!  
This is new information, and again adds to the confusion as there are other reports of being back behind the wheel at four weeks!  
So, what actually is the true situation?  My own common sense, would tell me that it is down to the individual patient's recovery rate, and not Draconian diktats that test and frustrate us even further!  
It's almost Kafkaesque!!!!

"Hello friends, firstly I hope you're all doing well.  My mum had her second hip op 2 weeks ago and has been struggling a bit so I told her about this forum, saying how helpful it is and reassuring.   She had a very smooth recovery first time around.   Anyhow, I'm now 14 weeks post-op LTHR, waiting for date for second.   I wanted to ask, for those of you that have experienced ongoing nerve type pain and knee swelling/pain, how long this went on for?   My hip itself is great and no issue with the scar so that's all good.  I have eased off in exercise as it seemed to be aggravating my knee quite a bit, and this doesn't seem to have made any difference?  I'm relatively good in the daytime, my problem starts in the later evening and during the night when the toothache like nerve pain, a bit like sciatica, starts and wakes me up.  I still can't bend sufficiently to out sock on operated leg or get down to the floor without easing my way down off a sofa or chair and then have to have something to grab on to in order to get back up.   Has anyone else experienced these things?

"I am wondering what the usual wait is for hip replacement in the Wiltshire/Somerset area?  When I contacted my hospital of choice, I was told that there was a wait for NHS patients of 6 - 12 weeks. Given the current state of the NHS, I was somewhat suprised by this.   
Now, I have been given information that some people are being made to wait for anything from 16 weeks to 40!  Another has said 6 months.
Does anyone know what the actual timing is currently in this area?  We have the holidays coming up, and the surgeons are certainly entitled to a break, but not entirely at the expense of those patients in intense pain, who will not be having any sort of a Christmas because of their pain levels.
There does seem to be some confusion as to waiting times, and a lot of it appears to depend on postal codes.

"Hello Hippies:
So I came into room with 2 week progress, was doing fantastic, walking with no cane / crutches, the last 5 days I'v been doing excessive amount of walking, climbing stairs, taking dog out 4X / day, etc...! 
Been having severe, excruciating pain in the right hip / buttock area, it takes me 5-7  steps before I feel comfortable walking, I called my doctor today, he said I've pushed myself too much, too hard, he said I ""must"" stop walking now, if I do walk, it has to be w/ a cane, he said the muscles are still very weak, it takes minimum of 6-8 weeks before the strength and muscle properly heals itself, he said if I continue walking, climbing stairs without the use of a cane or crutch I take a chance of permanent damage to the hip, it may not heal properly.  He has instructed me to use a cane 100% of the time if I have to wallk, he wants me to stay off my feet for 3-4 days, just doing some minor exercises, icing my hip / buttocks all day, he prescribed me anti-inflammatory pills.  
My reason for posting this is to encourage ALL patients to use their walking aid, don't push this too fast, which I did, this is a ""Marathon not a Sprint"", I am very upset, I thought I was indesctrutible, I am not, I should have continued using my cane, the fact that I didn't, means I am paying for my mistakes now, I will continue to provide updates regarding my progress and healing, take it easy, take it slow, don't not rush the healing process, take care and take it slow....!!

Is this just to discuss the op itself and the technique used, plus anaesthesia options, and how much time should I allow for the appointment?  Is this the point when chest exray (if needed) is done, ECG, blood, etc., medical history taken, or is that a later date?
Also, does the Christmas/New Year holiday create really significant delays in surgery that should be taken into consideration?
I am sure my GP will be able to give me some information, but they are not always up to speed on what is current, and need to refer to other medics.
Many thanks

"Having read many posts, I wondering just how much pain a patient with severe arthritis needs to be in before the NHS will consider surgery.  I have read posts where patients are in such excuriating pain they cannot work, and are suffering financially.  In a situation such as this they will be in all kinds of debt before they can even consider returning to work, and this is going to impact significantly on their recovery.  I am thinking mainly of patient on no hours contracts.
In the US, where I have lived and worked for most of my life, more than likely you would find yourself out of a job!
Surely, a diagnosis of severe arthritis should be enough to justify surgery, without compelling patients to suffer unendurable pain, for weeks/months on end, jeopardise their livelihoods, and then at almost the last minute, in many cases, cancel surgery the day before!
This is inhuman.  The RSPCA would not stand for this, if in the case of an animal....!  Would they...?
Is this common in the UK, now?

"Hello Everyone:
Looking for some feedback on length of hospital stays post op.  My initial enquiry when I contacted my hospital of choice was ""three nights.""  Since then, and having read the various postings on the site, it appears that some patients are being kept in for several more days than that.
Does this depend upon age and general state of health?  I would think that this would certainly come into the equasion.  In my own case, I live alone, and have no outside help.  However, I am in general good health, other than the bad hip.  I am a very youthful 74 years of age, and have been taken for mid 50s!  Keep very active, and used to jog, but I know that post op, that is not recommended - high impact, is out!  GP states that I am healthy.
I cannot, and do not want, a prolonged hospital stay, but am aware, that my personal safety is the main issue.  Surely, there is some provision in the UK for outside help under these circumstances, even if it is just to check that a patient hasn't taken a fall at some point!
I have lived most of my life in the US, so am not too familiar with the UK system.  Any feedback on any of this would be very helpful and reassuring.
No family to speak of, and my daughter doesn't drive.  She works in Bath, and I am in Wiltshire.  She would be dependent upon her boyfriend, who lives in Bristol to bring her here!  So, not much help there, I am afraid.

"Hi all - a bit of history first - couple of months ago had a physio assessment for back and knee, may be coincidental but next day had clicking hip and it felt loose. It didn't seem to improve over the next few days so booked hosp appointment - this was going to take a month - anyway over time it did get a lot better so I cancelled - I didn't want to take up the precious time of specialists unless I was really bad.
Since then I continued with my general activities - I'm retired - A walk of about 3 miiles every 2 weeks, and some gardening  a few days each week which does involve quite a bit of bending.
I have never since my op been able to sleep on the operated side it has always been too sore and still feels a bit numb on the side of the leg below the scar. The soreness however got really bad and my leg was hurting all the way down to my knee and then I was getting tingling pain in my shins. Went to my GP and he said I should go back and he would write also - so booked appointment. Because of the pain I stopped doing lots of things and have generally just been sitting around, a bit of housework and shopping. The pain has got a lot better - no pain in shins and above knee but I still have soreness in the trocanter region and can't sleep on that side.
Anyone had any similar problems after such a long time? On the one hand I think have I been doing too much and so maybe shouldn't bother the consultant. However  I don't think I've done anything over the top. I'm thinking I should still go to the appointment as you really should be able to lie on your side after all this time and I'm assuming if I start doing stuff again it will get worse.

It seems to me, that the sooner a THR is done, the better the outcome.  Leaving a patient until they are in absolute agony, and in all likelihood, the entire hip has become involved, is foolhardy.
Cost cutting in this way is likely to prove more expensive in the long run, and, leaving a patient until they reach this stage is extremely unfair and cruel.  
The American sites on the subject, have come up with some interesting data!

"I have a dilemma....please advise if you have a moment...
My consultant has said I can have my hip replacement at the beginning of Dec (as my three month wait is up after the steroid injections) but will it completely ruin any chances of me enjoying my christmas with my baby girls? I will be approx 3 weeks into it all, so not sure how I will be. Every christmas is precious when they are young... but I will have plenty of support over christmas from my husband will be home and friends and family who will all be on holiday and around (thus making it easier)
Or
Do I keep taking the morphine, even though it isn't working so well this week and I am back to being up alot in the night and now need to increase my dosage. I am worried the pain relief after the operation won't work as well if I need to keep taking more and more morphine now. I will have the op in Jan, but won't have the same level of support....

When I first joined this forum I was under the impression that having both hips done was quite a rarity. This forum has shown me that it may not be as rare or is becoming more common.
As I am due for my second hip op I am loosing track of all of you that have had or are going to have the second hip done.
I was wondering if it is harder to recover from the second one or do you actually feel better and heal quicker and could walk further with both hips replaced. I am just trying to get my head round this because I am more scared of having the second one done than I was having the first one done. I know I need to be out of pain and I have to go through it.

"Hello Everyone;
I am new to this, so please forgive me for not reading other responses at this time but I have a very serious questions. First, however, some history to explain the situation. Seven years ago, my wife had her right hip replaced and it seems the surgery was a success  the pain on that side is gone. Now, however, there is severe pain on the left side to the point where she is limping as bad as she was prior to the right hip replacement. When she went to see the doctor for the right hip, and an X-ray made her choice easy  a new hip or continued pain. For the left hip, an X-ray revealed there was still some cartilage left, and her doctor referred her to physical therapy as well as an Ibuprofen regiment. The latter helped a bit but my wife put off the P.T. for at least six months now (until I recently got on her about it) Thus, I am concerned it is 鍍oo late for PT to be effective and a left hip replacement in coming in the future. Has anyone else experienced this? By ""this,"" I mean having to have both hips replaced over time?
Thanks for your answer(s)

Well it was a roller coaster couple of days, with emergency doc coming out after a ten hour wait at three o'clock Sunday morning, followed by my own GP on Tuesday, now daily visits by district nurses.  The blister itself grew to the size of an orange, filled with bloody fluid(due to Warfarin apparently) and ruptured on Tuesday morning and was drained and cleaned by nurse.l'm now left with a huge wound where the blister was, which won't heal until swelling in foot and leg subside.  Question I have is when did people's swelling start to reduce?

"Hello friends, I'm now 13 weeks post LTHR and I'm due to see my GP tomorrow to discuss timing of my second hip replacement.   I am feeling really torn between getting it done ASAP because it's giving me real pain and almost holding me back from progressing as well as I could with my new left hip, and putting up with it for a few more months giving myself time to fully recover from the recent ordeal.   Common sense tells me to get in with it as soon as is reasonable - my surgeon said minimum of 4 months between ops, and I know there is a 4 month waiting list anyway which would take me up to March or April depending on when I'm listed.   
What would you all feel is best?  Have any of you waited until you're more or less fully recovered from first hip and felt this was best?
Thank you for your advice.

About 5 months ago, i had an accident while on holiday and shattered my hip (Pipkin Type Fracture), the surgeons put it back together. About a month ago it was found that the femour head collapsed and the best option was for me to have a total hip replacement. for the past 5 months i have been continuously on crutches or a wheelchair as i have been non-weight bearing. 
I'm 29 at the moment and i know this is very young to have such an operation. I know this is life changing for someone my age and chances are i would need another 4-5 more operations in the future.
I joined this forum just to get more information and comfort from people who have already had this.
How is everyones experiences of the THR?
How is the pain after the op?
Are you able to fully mobilise afterwards?
Has your quality of life improved alot since?
What are the problems associated?

"So, I am 7 weeks post op my second hip this week. I have had problems with this hip since day one. I had previous nerve damage from cancer surgery and the surgeon had to lengthen my leg a great deal this time. He had warned me that I would probably have bad nerve pain after the surgery. Well, he was correct. I told him to amputate or sedate me the day after surgery. He didn't, lol! Anyways, at my 2 week appointment to have my stitches clipped I was still in a great deal of pain and he talked about a nerve block. We decided to wait, because nerves sometimes just need time to settle down. Well, I've been counting down the days until my 8 week appointment. I've wanted to call everyday and tell him I'm not improving and my pain is awful. Well, on Tuesday I got a call from the fracture clinic at the Hospital thinking it was just a reminder of my appointment next week. The guy on the phone said that my appointment was cancelled and was rebooked for January 5 of next year. I told him I needed to see the surgeon as I was having problems and he told me to call his office. So after we hung up, I tried to call the surgeons office. The line was busy for an hour. Finally when I got through, I told them my appointment was cancelled next week. She asked me why? I told her I didn't know and that I thought he must be away next week. She had no idea why it was cancelled and couldn't believe that my next appointment was in January. So, the only appointment she had was at 8:00am on the same day my appointment was. That doesn't sound too bad, but if you guys have ever heard of what traffic is like in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, you would understand. My normal drive is about 1 hour, I have no idea what time I will have to leave and sit in traffic to get there for 8:00. Oh yeah, did I mention that when I told her what time my original appointment was, she said no, you don't have an appointment then. My appointment time had already been taken. I just don't understand what happened. I am just annoyed by the entire situation. I can't believe the guy who called to cancel my appointment wouldn't let me keep it even after I told him I was having problems and have just had a hip replacement. Argh!!!  Oh well. When I see my surgeon next week and let him know what has happened to me, some heads may spin. After being a patient in the health care system for so many years, I just wonder why certain people don't listen to, or should I say don't hear what patients are saying?

"Hi all, firstly, my sincere apologies for not being on here for a while. I've been soooooo busy.
Secondly, I hope you are all doing well in your recovery and keeping your spirits high.
I just thought I would give a quick update on my progress.
I'm now starting my 9th week post op and feeling really well. I ditched the crutches 3 weeks ago and I'm now walking fine without a limp. My hip feels really strong. No pain or aches so no meds needed either.
I just need to learn how to bend or lift again, haven't done it for years!
I returned to work full time 2 weeks ago and although it was tiring I felt ok. I'm still careful regards to slips or trips though and I'm already thinking about snowfall if it happens.
Driving for the last 4 weeks has been a godsend, I think I missed this the most.
Sleepwise, I'm sleeping really well on both sides, sometimes the muscle aches on the op side but nothing like the pre op pain, I can't lie on my op side on the floor though as it's still tender.
Dressing is back to normal including shoes and socks, I just can't clip my toenails (uurrgghh I hear you say!).
All in all I feel like a new person, having the operation is one of the best decisions I've ever made. It's completely changed my life, even after only 9 weeks!
Renee00, Kikeena, Rose000, Ali1, Ali2, Sassybees and everyone who I've forgot to mention, I hope you are all well and your recovery is going to plan. 
I promise not to be so long coming on here again.

I have pain, and cannot rely on my hip to be permanently pain free.  Occasionally, the entire right side will cause me to partially collapse due to the strain.  I cannot do very much, in the way iof walking distance, and cannot always make it around the supermarket due to the amount of distance covered from the parking lot to the supermarket and then around the various aisles.

"Hello all of my friendly hipsters! I hope the day finds you well. I haven't been in touch for a while...but have been reading and replying to lots of posts. 
Thanks to suggestions on here, I have been on morphine patches for a little while now (3 weeks)  and although I feel a little queasy and get blistering headaches sporadically they are really doing the job! They are nothing short of miracleous although my hip still hurts, it is nothing like the pain I was in. I am almost pain free remarkably! Apart from my hip collapsing (and not being able to drink a glass of wine anymore) I am much more comfortable and happy ~ why can I not simply stay on morphine patches forever and not have the operation at all (or for years)....are there good reasons to not do this? 
Most of you know how worried I have been about the surgery, so these patches seem to be a get out card, so my question is for those that know or have some advice...is there anything stopping me from simply staying on them until I literally can not use my leg anymore?
My last patch ran out before I could replace it last week and the agony was something else..it was so bad, so am a little scared about stopping them for any reason.
Would love your thoughts!

This forum was such a help to me when I had my new hip way back in August 2014 that I thought I would just update on here to give hope for everyone just going through it.
Last week I had my 12 month review (bit late but better late etc) I had xrays and went in to see the specialist and he was really pleased and told me to go away for two years as they are keeping an eye on the second hip.
I was really pleased with this as after I had my hip done I had to care for my husband so did a lot of heavy lifting which worried me. Sadly I lost my husband in April but then my hip dramatically improved, due to more walking and less lifting.
I would say I am virtually back to normal, still get problems going up some stairs at time or walking up a steep slope but no pain whatsoever.

I've definitely seen posts about toothache like pain which goes down the operated leg, and this can go on for some time but can't locate the discussions, so apologies for asking about this again.   
As as I said in my previous discussion, I'm now 13 weeks post LTHR and all going quite well.  I'm doing a fair amount of exercise and swimming every other day which I'm quite pleased about.  However, I'm troubled, particularly during the night, with this toothache like ache/pain in my leg, knee down.   It wakes me up continuously and it's difficult to get comfortable.

Once the xrays are in and I go back to the GP, should she then refer me on, at what point, am I able to select my preferred surgeon, etc.  I don't know how these procedures are conducted.  So, any help and advice would be of great help to me.  
I am worried, as I have seen posting on the site where infection has set in, coming from another source within the body,  My daughter's father died recently, post op because of infection, at age 88 years.  His was an emergency op as he took a fall and broke his hip, so rather a different scenario as opposed to elective surgery where the pre op examinations, etc. would normally have occurred.
Also, what is the preferred anaesthesia.  I have read that a lot of patients have epidurals, as opposed to a general anaethetic.  Is this based on health issues, or is this the preferred anaesthesia?  
Re:  point of entry to the hip for replacement:  anterior, posterior and lateral.  What determines this?  Is it based on weight of patient, surgeon's preference, age of patient, general health and fitness?  Do different surgeons have preferred approaches, or do they make their decision based on the above.  Does the patient have any choice or unput in decisions, assuming that they are fully informed?

They cleaned me up and put extra padded bandage on it and sent me home with some more. Has anyone else had this and how long did the bleeding last?

"I am pre op and trying to gather as much info as possible.  We have been advised not to bend the operated hip at a a full right angle.  So, how are we to sit up in bed, supported by pillows, sit at the dining table to eat, etc.  One one of the the other sites, I read, thaat we are suppose to have a an approved height bed!  My bedroom is small - new build, neeldess to say.  My bed is is an antique French Baroque, and there is certainly no room for a second bed of any description in there.  The spare room, has a small, low, Bergere day bed.  So, that is no use either.  Have to say that I find some of the recommendations rather absurd.  In this day and age, no one is going to be using a bed, that requires a step to mount it!  As long as the feet are able to touch the floor, flat, surely that is enough?  My mattress is a bit of a problem as it is a new Airsprung wih a topper attached.  I have mastered, it, and have practised getting in and out of bed, so I feel disinclined to ditch my bed and buy an ugly piece of furniture in its place, and then have to rid myself of it when I am back to as close to normal as is possible!
This is one of the most sensible and informative sites that I have found, as some of the so called information sites, are rather daft in their recommendations, and I do find that information differs enormously.

" 2 weeks after my op I thought I would treat myself to a ""Luxury Leather Reclining Massage Chair"" from Mailshop (Daily Mail online shop). Well it finally arrived last Friday by which time I was feeling really good about my new hip. It was a day over 3 weeks then and I was walking a bit round the house pain free and without crutches.
Yipee! the chair arrived and I got it all made up by a friend and the first time I used the chair on Friday afternoon it was really comfortable.
On Saturday again sitting in my consevatory reading(after morning exercises of course) and thinking wow this is the way to get over a hip op. Well it was time for a cuppa and thats when everything changed for me. I went to get out of the chair and there was a loud crack,was it my hip going? no it was one of the legs of the chair breaking in two making the seat tilt sharply forward and depositing me on the deck on my hip op wound. OUCH! The pain shot through me and I thought I had the dreaded dislocation. Couldnt get of the floor at first and had to get up by sliding setee cushions underneath one by one until high enough for the wife to pull me up.We did have a giggle about it.
Although the pain not now as bad as I thought it was going to be it is back to where I was a couple of weeks ago.
When I cotacted the Mail they said they had other chairs go like this but in each case it was the fault of the buyer because they tightened up the bolts too much. I dont belieeeeve it
Rest assured the saga will continue but in the meantime my advice would be DONT BUY ONE OF THESE CHAIRS

My swelling is completely gone, I've been able to shower on my own since day 4, so for all you fellow hippies, don't feel discouraged, don't feel you aren't making good progress, we all heal differently, we all recover at our body's own pace, be positive, be strong and look forward to better days once you are fully recovered, good luck to you all and again, I just wanted to give you an update on my progress and let everyone know there is ""HOPE""....!

"I have had a recommendation to a hospital.  It is a private hospital, but will take NHS patients.  I have no idea how to access the right surgeon there, and as I had a really bad experience in San Francisco, with surgery that was badly carried, and had to be corrected, I am naturally a little concerned about finding the right person.  The additional worry is that as this is a private hospital, as a NHS patient, I may find myself with someone who is not experienced in this type of surgery, and will botch the surgery,  
This is exact;y the situation that I found myelf in san Francisco:  surgery performed as an insurance patient, on my dominant hand.  Surgeon botched up and I was told later, that he was more used to operating on feet!   In other words, I was used a guinea pig!  I would like to avoid this scenario.

"I have had two hip relpacements over a period of time.  I had the right one done and then a few years later the other one.  I told the doctor the leg that was already done was longer than the one he is going to do.  He checked it out and said it was about an eight of an inch shorter.  He said he would fix that with the next replacement.  He didn't get it fixed and it remained an eighth of an inch shorter.  I just let it go.
Now that I am older, I have trouble with my balance.  When walking, I will lose my balance and grab onto something.  It seems strange that an eighth of an inch could make the difference.  Anyway I have fallen four times this year.  
Would lifts make a difference?  If so what kind?  Any information will help.

"Hello Everyone,
I am right at the beginning of the journey into have my right hip replaced.  Last xray, taken two years ago, showed moderate to severe arthritis.  Needless to say, although I have been doing the exercises that the phsyio gave me, my condition has worsened.  Scheduled for third set of exrays at the end of November.  
I have a few concerns that maybe the forum can help me with.  For the life of me, I cannot sleep on my back.  I always start the night, on my left side (left handed) and do use diazepam as a sleep aid.  Used to take Temazapam, and I am thinking of asking my GP to put me back on it for the first six weeks, or so, post op, if the hospital insists that I sleep on my back.  Additionally, I am aware that I move around a lot in my sleep  Will they want to restrain me....!!!?  Otherwise, I will never sleep, and that does not help recovery - does it...?  I hoping to go to one of Circle hospitals.  Does anyone know anything bout them?  I have been told that they are the best option for this type of surgery.  
I have done a fair amount of research, but have found that each site give varying ibnformation.  I have spoken to Circle, and they say you are in hospital for three nights, and admitted the night before surgery.
I am a former smoker, still working on it, and using the E cigarettes, but mostly in the morning.  I am 74 years and have smoked for about 50 years, although not every day.  Stopped smoking tobacco about three months ago, although there has been the occasional lapse.  I am worried about the chest xray.  I have read that in some cases a spinal block or epidural is used, rather than a General Anaesthesia.  Think this is mostly a technique for patients with cardiac problems, although, there are hospitals, I am told that use spinal block or epidural and not Gen An.
I live alone, and am quite fit for my age, look about 20 years younger, I am told!  The arthritis, of course, has put a stop to any proper exercise, so, no cardio vascular exercise for quite a while now, unfortunately.  
Reading through some of the forums, I have found that recovery rates vary enormously, and some people are still immobile after six weeks post op, which is alarming.
I live alone in a ground floor flat,and am wondering how people living alone manage post op.  In addition, I have a cat.  We are told not do certain things like bending down, etc.   How on earth do I feed Tallulah?  It's these silly little practical things that make life difficult, so wonder what other people's managing techniques are?  I know you can buy grabbers, etc.
Think the above is enough for now.  Any and all feedback and info would be most helpful.

"Hi...I apologize if this has already been covered; however there is so much info to read I though it easier just to ask the question. 
Details:
I am a little over 3 weeks since my surgery.  I have had 6 in-home PT's, my leg was very swollen after surgery; however now is good, but a little weak.  I am on a cane but can walk without it. I do 2 sets of exercises daily given to me by PT.   I am sleeping on my back and only taking Narco in order to sleep, nothing throughout the day.  I am 57 years old.
Question:
I still have a little swelling at the incision, I can kind of feel that I have a new hip...not sure that is the best explanation; however when I do some exercises it feels like a band or mechanical as I move my hip.  I have trouble sitting in a chair for more that 5-10 minutes. Basically my leg hurts more than I expected.  I understand that everyone heals differently; however just checking on others to see if my sitting and mechanical hip feeling has been felt by other folks and any suggestions, thoughts they may have.

I couldn't get up but a lovely man and his wife stopped their car and helped me even brought me home - which when you consider I live in London is a miracle in itself. Both knees are cut and still weeping fluid and blood. I have been to the hospital and all is ok with hip - it's just the rest of me that's in a bad way!! Covered in bruises and will have internal bruising around hip ( how do they know that??). 
Been told to rest for few days which will be easy as I'm very shaken up and weepy. The moral of the tale is don't get complacent (like I did) it's good to push yourself but be careful too. A careful balance.

"I had my original hip implant uncemented 2  and a half years ago.
All went well for the first 4 m and then I began to get pain at mid thigh which became so bad that I could not walk 100 yards without severe pain.
Consultants all denied an issue and after considering all their suggestions - lose weight (I did) use a crutch for a while (I did) I eventually decided that at 52 I had become disabled. I was not supposed to be disabled after an op that was supposed to be better, not worse, so I demanded a revision (yes demanded) I was given wide eyed looks and eventually they tested for infection and xays and Gamma rays. The Gamma showed a glow at the tip of the implant. They tried to tell me it was no biggy but I asked if it was likely I would improve, they had to say no. No reason in their eyes to have a revision, but I insisted on seeing another surgeon who agreed suffiicient pain == a revision, except he kept on finding reasons not  to put me on the list. He wrote to my GP saying when I had a BMI under 38 he would do it (I WAS ALREADY under BMI 38) but when I pointed this out he ignored me. I returned to first consultant and confirmed I wanted him to do the revision, he wasnt keen saying so many risks. I said quality of life was very important. He said 50/50 for a cure and he suspected he would have to break my leg to remove current implant.
Even the day of surgery he asked if I was sure. I said yes. 
Upon waking no weight on leg for 10 weeks,No driving. No upstairs  so I had to sleep on a riser recliner and wash in the downstairs loo, get someone to wash my hair and use a commode at night.
I followed his directions and now am allowed to drive and am on crutches to walk and I am not quick BUT no thigh pain..... Arse pain yes but the really bad pain seems to be gone.
I am still disabled for now and it will take another 6-9 months to heal the femur and regain muscle waste BUT I think it will be fine. The spike is near my knee now and the gait of my walk I think put pressure on the old implant - the new one seems to be good. So the moral is do not accept second best, quality of life is EVERYTHING

What post op exercise have you been given? I was very impressed that my consultant gave me his personal mobile number in case I needed help and was unable to get through.

"Hi all fine hippies....
Visit to the doc痴 today, was talking about the medication I知 currently on etc, regarding the topic of THR. I was told again that they would be more happier if I was to wait until I was around the 55yrs rather than the 51yrs I am now.  The doc was saying that they tend to do the procedure only twice max,  more than twice and the doc said there could be complications etc...
Just wanted to ask, is the doc thinking of my health etc at 51yrs or the cost of a possible 2 THR...
Would appreciate your input over this...

"I just wanted to write to tell folks that I had two total hip replacements, one on the  right and one on the left; one last summer and one fourteen years ago. I am 56.
For the first replacement, I had almost no pain and was on a bike in three weeks. Quite remarkable.
For the second replacement, I had tremendous pain for a month and a half. I took alot of pain killers, suffered from constant migraines (reaction to the anesthesia I think) and my legs were of uneven lengths.
I was VERY depressed and discouraged.
I guess I am writing to give people hope and also to know that two experiences can be so different.
I am fine now, five months later. I have no arthritic pain and the only thing that hurts still is the scar area if I ride in a car for too long. My walk looks normal though there is still a tiny difference which I am hoping will correct. My message is to have faith that you will heal and work at it.
I did lots of physical therapy which I think is really important.
Good luck to you all.
    Best Wishes for speedy recoveries,
            Sally

"Hi,
So I had a hip scope earlier this yr - I expected to make a very speedy recovery but 8 months on and I am worse than I ever was before surgery. I have pain daily and due for a second steriod injection in a week.
Post that and a scan the conversation with the consultant is going to be around a hip replacement - which scares me. 
I wonder if anyone has experience a failed hip scope? 
What pain levels indicate replacement? I have low level constant aches with sharpe pains - movement is really restricted and the most active I can be is walking - even than I dont walk normally. 
I was grade 3 earlier this yr - how long before I get worse? What have other people experience? 
Thanks!

"My THR on left hip is scheduled for tomorrow.  Right hip was done in March.  I am having a bad day today as I know what is in store.  I am hopeful that this surgery goes well and that my stronger right hip will help with the recovery of the left.  I am nervous about the spinal since a nurse friend told me that even though they say I will be heavily sedated and not hear , see or feel anything the same as last time, she thinks they gave me a drug that makes me not remember anything and was likely wide awake.  Somewhat like the rape drug.  I did not remember anything until I was wheeled into my ward.  I had no recollection of the recovery room at all.  I am really scared that I will be awake.  There will be a major snow storm tomorrow and the hospital is an hour drive right through itl  I know I am ranting but i am so scared.

"Hello everyone, well I'm now 12 weeks post-op and slightly disappointed that I seem to have halted in my progress, if not gone slightly backwards?  I'm walking fine, going to the gym and swimming every other day.  Over the last week I have had toothache like pain/aches from mid thigh,nth rough knee and down lower leg pretty much all the time but especially at night.  I also has swelling, not huge but troublesome, in the muscle above my knee and it feels as though I have a tight band around the knee making it  slightly difficult to step up or step down stairs - it's as though something is restricting the movement?  Has anyone else experienced this.  My physio and surgeon did say that swelling and aches/pains can continue for several months on and off so I'm not unduly worried, rather that I'd like to know I'm not the only one experiencing this.  I am working quite hard at exercising, not overdoing it but static cycling, walking (including uphill) and still doing the basic exercises we were all advised of pre and post op.  
I don't want to give the impression that I'm not delighted to have a new hip because I am.  
Looking forward to to hearing from you.  Jo xxx

Please does anyone have experience of the Anterior Approach,and can you offer any comments ?
I am terrified not only of the op. but of undoing the good work by my clumsy and awkward  movements afterwards. Living alone and being old (79 years), and accident prone, I am keen to make the most sensible choices.
I have been following the forum for ages and have learned a great deal from the many hippy contributors. Thank you all for your open and generous contributions and many thanks for any answers to this post.

"I'm not sure where to start or why I'm even posting. It would be nice to hear from someone who has been through the same thing.
About 8 months ago I was walking to work when I was hit by a drunk driver. To cut a very long story short I broke my right hip, my right leg in numerous places and my right ankle. I'm doing pretty well now 8 months on. I walk with one crutch.
The complicated thing is I have foot drop due to the impact damaging my sciatic nerve. I cant dorsiflex my right foot at all. It's mostly numb. I have more feeling now definitely but I've had nerve conduction tests done and time will tell! As a result of that my right thigh has no strength at all because the muscle and nerve were so badly damaged. Hence why I'm still on a crutch. I can walk without but I limp and its sore. Other than that I am pain free. I'm not on any med anymore. I do physio exercises most days and use a tens machine.
I guess I'm just looking for anyone out there who has the same issue. Some days I feel like I will never get off this damn crutch and as I'm only 32 it's not a future I had envisaged. I'd love to hear from other people who have had a crutch and maybe took time to get back to normal. I am determined to get back to normal, even if it's not the normal I was used to. I know I'll probably never run again but I can do almost everything else, just a little slower!

My job as an industrial electrician means Im on the go most of the time and Im training to do the West Highland Way next year. my phone app is telling me Im walking upto 10 miles a day and it will be getting more as my training goes on.
Im not sure if this is whats causing the pain or its the muscles in the groin area are not strong enough and I hear the odd clicking noise like the joint is being pulled appart and then going back together when I lift my leg to climb a scaffold / steps and therefore im thinking I need to do more exercises.
any thoughts? are there any exercises I could do to strengthen the joint muscles?

"Hi all
I am new to the group having joined a few days ago.  I live on my own and am having a THR two weeks today - 19 November.  I wasn't too worried but last night read a thread from some people post op and ended up being terrified and wondering if I was doing the right thing in having the operation.
I have quite a few questions and wondered if any of you could help me with any or all of them.  I am extremely independent and do not want help in the house once I get home.  I am having the operation in Wrightington, about 30 miles from home in Blackpool.  A good friend is taking me into hospital, I haven't yet arranged for anyone to pick me up but don't think it will be a problem getting someone.
I don't have a walk in shower but have a good shower over a bath.  Will it really be 12 weeks until I have a shower or could I use a bath step to help me get into the shower in less time than that?  How do people manage to wash their hair without being able to get into the shower?  I would fnd it difficult to do leaning over a basin.
How soon could I go out in a taxi?  Am I likely to feel able to go out for a meal four weeks post op if I am picked up or else get a taxi?  In fact how early did you first go out?  
How early were you allowed to drive?  I have an automatic and it is a people carrier so fairly high off the ground and easier to get into than a much lower saloon.  
Please can some of you reassure me that it doesn't have to be quite as bad as some of the things I read last night?
Thanks all.

"I'm fast approaching the 6 week post op mark and generally doing well.
However I do get itchy hands and feet which are a nuisance.
I think I've seen a reference to this before but can't remember what was the cause.
It occurs only on the palms of the hands and inner surface of the fingers, and on the soles of the feet.
When it was only on the hands I put it down to pressure from use of crutches but then it developed on the soles of the feet.
Thanks for any ideas

"How many new tricks can an old dog learn? I was going to title this 斗earning to walk again, but in my case I don稚 think I致e ever walked properly.
Apparently if you walk properly you are more comfortable and use half as much energy as the flat footed gait I致e had. I really want to learn to walk properly so I will eventually be able to walk further and enjoy it more. I知 only talking short walks and shopping here folks, but even these have been tough for me for the last 10 years. I'm declaring my goal here. I don't usually make goals, especially physical ones. So this is different for me!
So heel to toe, stand up straight and swing those arms. If anyone wants to know more there痴 some good info on youtube under ""heel to toe walking"".
Does anyone want else interested in this?

"Hi fellow hippies
got a phone call today from my surgeons secretary saying that she has had to cancel all hip ops for this week and next  because of multi trauma patients that have arrived because of  a major car crash on the M4. This means that not only have I been put back AGAiN.  I probably won't be in for my op now till December. I do not want to be in hospital in December. I find it hard to trust hospital staff as it is without worrying if they had, had a few drinks the night before at a party. 
I hate being in hospital over weekends and  major holidays because I don't feel the care is good enough so that is another worry. I am in so much pain because I have had to stop some of my pain killers now. Because they have to be stopped at least a week before an op.
Now they have cancelled me I still can't take them again. I don't care how much pain I am in wild horses won't drag me into a hospital too near or over Christmas. So looks like it may be January now.

They did a blood test . I have no infection. Tomorrow they are taking fluid off my hip. Still not quite sure the reason since i have no pain in the actual hip joint. After that they will do a bone graft.  Has anyone else had this problem?  i have titanium cementless inplants.

When the levels of pain just kept increasing I was given an x-ray which showed I needed both hips replacing.
This just seems to be taking for ever and nobody seems interested in trying to relieve the pain which is just steadily getting worse. After spending several months on the NHS list and several phone calls they finally asked if i would like my case looked at in a local private hospital.
I agreed to this and from referral to that hospital I am getting the first hip done in 3 weeks time, why couldn't they have offered me that option weeks ago.

I'm cleared to sleep on my side with a pillow between my legs to stop my operated on leg rolling forward - which it does of course when the pillow dislodges! I'm trying not to take any painkillers (paracetamol) during the day and that's fine as I have little pain moving around. But still discomfort when I don't move for any period of time - hence feeling uncomfortable at night. I do often take a couple of paracetamols at bedtime but this doesn't seem to make sleeping any better. I'm often awake in the small hours and increasingly tired during the day.

This is draining in itself but I also work full time as a teacher and because of the waiting and the obvious pain in my hip I am feeling completely uninterested and have lack of motivation to do anything. It's quite difficult to explain how I feel to those close to me and was wondering if anyone on here felt like this before the op? I am normally a very independent organised person but I just can't focus on my work and even the thought of it sends me into panic. The op is consuming me and the fact that I may also have to have an epidural and sedation instead of GA is not helping me either as I have a major fear of needles and panic that I may also hear and feel the op now!! Sorry if this sounds crazy but I am struggling.

"Hi, I'm 27 years old and had a serious car accident that resulted in me breaking my hip and pelvic bone. I ended up having 2 surgeries and foot drop after my 2nd surgery. I feel like my foot drop is never going to go away. PT has tried the electrical nerve machine thing. (sorry can't remember what the medical term for it is. ) no movement at all even when it was turned up pretty high.  He was shocked! Said my foot drop was one of the worst he has dealt with.  Of course my luck.  I am a single mom of a 7 year old daughter who is my life. I'm so scared I'm gonna be permanently disabled. Surgeon and PT said it is a 50/50 chance that my foot drop will heal and if it doesn't that I will walk with a limp because it throws your gait off and also will never be able to be as active and do the normal activities I did prior to injury.  I am now a little over a month post op. Still in lots of pain. Going through so many emotions. I'm so grateful to be alive don't get me wrong but this has been so life changing. I'm scared for what my future holds. I guess I'm just looking for support. I feel so alone. I'm tired of depending on my mom for everything. My independence is out the window for at least another couple months maybe longer depending on outcome. Tired of depending on pain medications to get by everyday. In so much pain constantly can barely do anything with my daughter whom I miss doing activities with and taking her places. Tired of not being able to sleep.  Just feeling so many emotions. Sorry for such a long post just want to hear from others that may be going through the same thing.  I feel as though I am such a bother and inconvenience to family and friends.  Hope to hear from someone. God bless, Ashley

"Hi there Hippies
I am approaching a 2 year anniversary of a painful hip replacement. In the meantime I have had the other hip replaced.
My consultant has taken second opinions and now feels confident about revising my first hip - he will replace the liner and put in a smaller head with a smaller offset.
As I have not been able to work for 2 years and have bimbled along in patient mode - this news about another operation is both good and terrifying. I feel as if this the last shot to get me better and back to walking the fells of the Lake District. But what if it does not work? I would hate to be a house elf - going from a very active 51 year old to a house elf in 2 years has been hard enough.
Any words of experience and / or encouragement would really help

"If anyone is offered to attend one of these optional pre-op educational classes, I highly recommend it.
I just had mine today, and it was wonderful.  It was a 3 hour event, and didn't have any doctors/your surgeon, but instead had people who worked at the hospital.
They had a social worker who talked about post-op care and things they can provide.  She gave us numbers to call about borrowing walkers etc, and just helped with how to get the small details taken care of pre-op.
The physical therapist took us through some pre-op strengthening exercises to do, and talked a lot about post-op and how our recovery will be handled in the hospital and out of it.
The Pharmacologist talked about the blood thinners and pain killers we'd be given, the side-effects of each and offered solutions to help with them. He also answered any questions about current medications and how/when to stop them before the operation.
Lastly, the Nurse took us through out entire stay. From check-in, all the way to check-out. She told us what would happen, what our schedule would be etc, in as much detail as we wanted.
I almost didn't go, as going out for me means no pain-killers since they make me too groggy, and it's just a painful, irritating experience anytime I have to leave the house. 
If you're in a similar situation, it is definitely worth the misery.  Having everything explained prior to when you're on a bed signing paperwork was wonderful.

I went to the same hospital I went too 2 months ago where I was told I was far to young, and to go back when the pain is unbearable, but make sure that's in 15 years time. How consultants differ in their views ..

"Morning all,
Hope all my fellow pre and post op hippies are doing well. I haven't been around much, sorry, as decorated the entire upstairs while I've been off, new carpet right through and flat pack surgery to assemble so it's been all go! 
I'm 9 weeks post op today and doing well, apart from a 3/4 inch leg length difference which I'm getting inserts in my shoe for. I'm pretty much pain free though, a little stiffness after sitting for a while or walking a long way but apart from that it's all been a complete success! I am pain free now, can walk the stairs like a fit person and can sleep on both sides with minimal pain. It was about 4 or 5 months last time before I could sleep properly on my side all night so I know this will improve. I'm scheduled to go back to work on November 9th on phased return so it looks like my hippie journey is almost at an end. 
I want to thank all of you wonderful people on here for helping me through the dark days and celebrating with me in my little triumphs. Without you all this would have been a lonely road to travel. This isn't goodbye but obviously once back at work I will not have the opportunity to get on here as much as I have but will still be around and will post whenever I can.
Much love to you all and may your road to hippie success not always be under construction.

I am persevering but if anything my sleep is worse and when I do sleep I have vivid dreams. Also at the moment I am so ratty I don't like myself very much. 
Thanks for letting me get it off my chest.
