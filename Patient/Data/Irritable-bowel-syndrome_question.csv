"My stomach issues have become a daily hinderance to my sleep and health. I can barely eat. I have the urge to poop almost all day but am constipated and mucus and barely anything comes out. My stomach hurts so much sometimes its hard to fall asleep. I am actually worried something is severely wrong with me but I don't have the money to get medical attention like I need. The rotting feeling inside me gives me deep anxiety.
My CPTSD leaves my highly stressed most of the time even though I try to relax. The stress and depression take a toll on my physical health because basic things like eating and sleeping become difficult to maintain. I really want to get better, im struggling.

"I have not had a colonoscopy in 11 years and not sure I want to have one as I have heard several stories of complications from people who have had one.
Then I have seen lots of advertisements about this new test Colonguard but my doctor is not too high on it.
I struggle with IBS-mainly terrible stomach cramps. Can go months without a problem and then it will hit me and I am pretty miserable.
Of course, when it hits then I am worried it is something worse which stress just causes it to be worse. 
Havent found any medicine to be very effective. 
Any words of wisdom from any of you out there?

"Hi there
For a couple of years now I have been having a very strange happen to me, it used to happen occasionally but now it is every time I go for a bowel movement.
I will be happily going about my business or working or whatever when suddenly out of the blue I get this horrible feeling which is hard to describe, like a sinking feeling or impending doom. My fingers go tingly, I have difficulty breathing, shaky, fast heart rate...and then I need a bowel movement immediately. If I go I start to feel better after while, if for whatever reason I can't go right away it feels as if I will die.
anybody else with anything similar?

"Hi,
For years I had very occasional symptoms of painful defecation, blood in stool, discomfort sitting down, bloating and general fatigue. But they would come for about a week or so then might not happen again for 6 months - so due to the embarrassment on my part and difficulty getting a doctors appointment whilst the symptoms were occurring I just ignored it.
Back in 2020 I decided to go on a low carb diet (including not drinking) and I very quickly developed these symptoms. As time went on they got worse and worse (to the point where I was struggling to work) until I finally went to the doctors. They took a load of tests and everything came back negative. They told me it was probably IBS, to take paracetamol for the stomach cramps and that's about it. I then decided to stop the diet and within a week I was absolutely fine. I went through the whole of 2021 without any issue at all (which was a bit unusual).
I then decided to do 'dry january', where you don't drink any alcohol during january - and was fine at first. But now the symptoms have come back. I'm not dieting really, the only major change i've made is the lack of beer. Do people think there's any chance that this is a trigger for me, or just a coincidence? It doesn't make any sense to me . . . .

"just over 2 years ago i began feeling a waxy substance in my hair, initially i thought it was build up from my conditioner, but then what followed were small yellow tear drop shaped seed like pieces falling on me from my hair - i googled this and although I was not itchy , I was certain I had lice? i used Rid 7 times to no avail. i started feeling crawling sensation on my back and arms and buttocks and once again through google i believed this mist be scabbies? I went to ER and told them i believed I had scabbies? they stood 10' from me and just afreed and sent me home with a scrip for Permethrin cream. this did not help, -I went to urgent care and got more Permethrin cream and applied this for the second time, also no results. I went back and got oral ivermicin took the pills and also no results . when i returned for the third time they took a urine sample which they said was normal and the doctor wrote it was ""unidentified mycosis"" she gave me a oral med which i cant recall and said ""if this doesnt work- dont come back"" and that was the last doxtor that entertained any treatment whatsoever... the next 5 doctors all suggested this was my imagination... I then went to a dermatologist who assured me i dis not have any form of parasite and what I had was dermatitis... she prescribed me shampoo and roll on and antibiotics. I asked her to do a scrape of my scalp and she refused. her treatment did nothing... The next few doctors destroyed my beliefs that anyone would help me or even believe me! i learned when you tell a doctor you feel something crawling on you- this means you're insane. i noticed my dog was showing my same symptoms and 5 differnt vets agreed I was insane.... by this point my scalp is covered with lesions and i cant cry loud enough for anyone to care! i began to think it was fungal or bacterial and went through all the expensive OTC shampoos etc.. all to no avail. my dogs $380 allergy shot also wasn't helping ... by this time my friends and even family refused to even discuss my ailments, they believed i must be on drugs? Aloe, tea tree oil , apple cider vinegar, not helping, and just when it seems like this is possibly clearing up? it will return 10 fold! my last pcp refused to scrape, refused to refer me to a dermatologist and repeatedly suggested i see a phychiotrist.... By this point im shattered! I view most everything in life from a very realistic place and They all think im crazy! im suffering! my dog is suffering! and no one gives a damn! Im alone in this fight im losing! then as I felt something on my hair i reached up and pulled it out and was shocked at what i found ! It was easy to see it was some sort of insect wrapped in a sort of cacoon? I began to research this and thats also when I noticed several fresh holes in my carpets and clothing and sofa! and dog! without question For over two years all my problems and my dogs problems are all being caused by a infestation of carpet beatle Larvae! exterminators bombs and major cleaning and other steps are being taken to rid me of this mess! and it seems to be going well , my dog is already on the mend !!!but its not over! if they called me crazy before? .... for the past couple weeks ive been terribly constipated! strong laxatives dont even help much! I feel like i have to go, but i sit for hours and cant produce anything! i feel something moving around on my anus and I began to feel around and today I removed what is very similar to the things I would find falling from my hair two years ago! yes i dont think- i damn well know i have eggs or larvae in my anus! so what do I do? How do i get anyone to take me seriously? i even think it sounds bat s**t crazy! but im certain this is very real and I need help! can anyone help me? advise me? tell me what to say to get help! please! tomorrow will be day 4 with no BM!

"Hello everyone,
My son is 13 y/o. It all started a year ago and we have visited several doctors and specialist, they did all sorts of tests and everything was fine. They said he is OK and there is nothing wrong with him but he still has the same weird symptoms:
Some weeks he is perfectly OK, can eat anything he wants and his stools are normal
Then comes a week when he is constantly in the toilet, has mucus instead of stool or more loose stools and cramps.
The bad week happens once a month or once every two months, sometimes it happens when he has exams at school or when he is stressed, sometimes it happens during the summer vacation and for no apparent reasons.
My mom and my sister have a strong form of IBS, my mom has a severe one. I wonder, is this connected to genetics? Can such a young teenager suffer from IBS? I know IBS is connected to anxiety (he is very anxious) but since it happens also during holidays I wonder, what can this be?
The tests for food allergies, lactose intolerance, celiac disease, blood in stools and inflammation were all negative. The doctor keeps saying all looks fine but it must be something, right?
Can it really be IBS?

"Hi asking advice ive always suffered with IBS had a colonoscopy in 2003 and it cane back fine. I had a poo test 2 months ago which came back high at 138 so I had to repeat it and that ones come back double at 308 so they say it’s could be more IBD than IBS which is colitis/chrons disease basically life changing stuff. They thought it was my gall bladder so they took it out but the pains kept coming on and off. Iv got an urgent referral to gastro for a colonoscopy so we can see what we are dealing with. They asked for urgent bloods that came back yesterday Good news all bloods came back and they are fine even the inflammation one. Only one came back slightly abnormal was liver count everything was okay with liver apart from one which was slightly high. Says just need to repeat test. No blood in stools fit test negative. No doctor to talk to until tomorrow. Do you think it could be IBS thats just caused a high count. any advice would be appreciated im beside myself. thanks Ange

"hey all !
just a quick note i developed health anxiety after having my 2nd child so I know i can be irrational but i am truly terrified .
sep 2020 i noticed change in stool habits and pain , i was alternating between constipation and loose stools, i had a blood test and stool test and everything was clear.
May 2021 - i noticed a little blood in stool and was also bloated , had an endoscopy , colonoscopy , scan of kidneys and ovaries , everything was fine , colonoscopy found hemmoroids and some slight inflammation and took biopsy but said it was just a little infection.
since then nothing has changed but saturday night i had pains all night woke up and had weird gassy loose stool, mucus and red blood that sent my anxiety through the roof and i have convinced myself i have something horrible , sunday i only ate toast so monday no bowel movement , tuesday was constipation and the stool was covered in mucus with a little bit of blood , weds and thurs soft stool no blood but lots of mucus and today i am having very loose stools again with mucus and no blood , i have pain in my hip and back and i am very gassy.
i cant eat or sleep cause i am terrified , does anyone know what it could be ?
side note - my daughter has been vomiting this morning but i cant see how that is linked to me.
any advice/reassurance would be amazing !!

"I was diagnosed with IBS many years ago & have always had the more common symptoms like bloating, food sensitivity, tummy pain etc…
However I’ve recently developed some worrying symptoms & I’m struggling to find a gp as I’m new to the area.
Last week I was on my period & randomly got a pain across my lower back & down the top of both my legs making it painful to stand or walk for long periods but I was fine if sat down or laying down. Also very bloated.
I assumed it was connected to my period but once my period ended - the leg & back pain subsided but I’m now left with a pain in my left groin - that randomly moves to the left side of my hip but mainly is a dull ache in my left groin.
I’m also experiencing gas in my lower groin- whereby I can hear it bubble & am still bloated.
It’s worse in the morning when I wake up & once I’ve pooed it eases off a bit. Poop is soft (always has been).
I also have ovarian cysts that come & go so I was wondering if it was cyst related or ibs related?
Other than that I’m fine in myself, I have an appetite, no fever etc…
Anyone else experience this with ibs?

"I have had symptoms of IBS for the past week and a half and they seem to not be going away. I have had IBS symptoms in the past — but nothing like this before: bloating, constipation, diarrhoea, gassiness, mucus in stool, etc. I went to the doctors before and they examined me and said that it was more likely IBS and that I should up my intake of fibre (fruit and vegetables).
I used to suffer from health anxiety and when on holiday or away from home used to hold by poop in for several days (unless it absolutely necessary to go; which I have stopped now) due to fear of viruses and germs from toilet seats. I read it could increase your likelihood of developing colon cancer and now I am freaking out that I may have CC. I haven't had any blood in my stool (apart from when I strain due to being constipated and it has gone away after a few days). I feel like I need to have a urgent need to go but very little comes out. After I have a bowel movement I either feel full (still) or super-hungry.
I was recently sick from flu or a cold (not COVID) and all of a sudden started with diarrhoea which has gone from the latter to normal stool and then back again. I have also stared with a pain in my left-side (almost like a throbbing sensation that doesn't really hurt) and pain underneath my rib cage.
I am also autistic — I have Asperger's syndrome and suffer from anxiety (more precisely heath anxiety or hypochondria) which my grandmother also had the latter and I have heard that both anxiety and autism is connected to IBS and GI issues.
I am going crazy over this... please help.

"Hello everyone,
If you've seen my previous discussion from last year, you will know I was having problems with undigested food, strands of fibre and these yellow balls in my stool.
After eliminating dairy and going vegan once again, the symptoms cleared up for a bit. However, after a couple months, the strands of fibre and yellow balls have come back!
I'm once again worried about these yellow balls - they're a bit hard to touch, but squidgy and semi-solid in the middle (it's not sweetcorn - the balls are bigger, plus I haven't eaten any in the past week to rule this out anyhow). They appear more so when my stools are harder but can also appear in soft stools.
Is anybody experiencing similar symptoms or does anyone have any ideas about what these could be?

"6 months ago I got strange abdominl pulsating. First it was in the area of aorta after that slightly bellow left rib cage. It is not possible to calm it down. Sometimes it looks like I have bird stuck in my belly. Aorta on ultrasound was fine, I had only gallstones. MRI was clear for any abdominal mass. Endoscopy was normal, no hiatal hernia. When I wake up stomach is pulsating, I eat it calms a bit, but than it starts again. All the blood work was fine. I have been diagnosed with POTS but it doesn't explain the pulsations just maybe tachycardia provoked by eating. Sugar provokes tachycardia almost immediately, but the sugar was never high. I have insulin resistance for quite some time. Sometimes I get tachycardia after drinking plain water? I wore heart monitor and they said that I have paroxismal tachycardia provoked mainly by eating. Than they told me that excess gas is causing this issue and that is maybe Roemheld Syndrome or IBS. I do not have diarrhea, just sometimes floating stool from the gas and sometimes soft pieces of stool . Burping and belching is present. Helico is negative in blood and stool. I will do SIBO next week. Gluten is negative. Could it be some extreme GERD as I have pain in mu throat sometimes after waking up even though I sleep on very high pillows. I also realized that certain body position like slight bending aggravates heart issue. Hot water aggravates, travelling in car aggravates as well as laying on the back. So during a day I am most of the time walking. Usually when I sit I get pain very high in the chest above the breast for which I am not sure is it heart or gas that high? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Is it maybe connected with the spine (scoliosis) or vagus nerve? I was out of work for almost 5 months.

"hello! I have been fighting to understand my fatigue for a few years and saw a functional md who told me that he knew that I had sibo although no traditional symptoms to speak of at the time. He gave me Rifaximin, neomycin and flagyl as well as two strong anti herbal preparations and a alternative antibiotic. Within 2 days I became seriously depressed for the first time and my fatigue worsened, it felt like someone poured cement in my gi tract and shut my body off. The doctor told me to subside each pill day by day and I was left feeling pretty lifeless and not like myself. A month later I had a belly that looked like I was months pregnant and intense fatigue, every day the stomach would become larger and I began to not be able to get out of bed or sleep due to difficulty breathing. I suffered for over a year and had a colonoscopy and upper endo that showed 45 eiosinaphils but not in the mid and active severe esophagitis. None were addressed to me however. The functional Dr. insisted that I do a gi map that led him to reneg on his sibo diagnosis and told me that my iga in my stomach was incredibly high. The doctor dropped me as a patient and I am left with this 9 month pregnant belly, fatigue and unable to eat and be active. I loved fiber and probiotics prior to the antibiotics and now I can not tolerate them or most foods. I am wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone ??

"Hi, am interested to hear from other constella users but also hope my story helps others debating about whether to try it.
Some background: have suffered from constipation most of my adult life ( now in my 50s) and tried all the usual stuff, Fybogel, OTC drugs, supplements, senna, diets etc etc etc and nothing seemed to help. As an anxiety sufferer too, being constipated seems to be my natural state! Couldn't ever go without some form of help.  I have some really bad flare ups where I just can't go without straining no matter what without aggressive combos of senna, stool softeners, syrup of figs etc.
Two colonoscopies over the years both fine.  GI Cons wanted me to try Constella a couple of years ago but reading reviews put me off.  I'm also on long term lansoprazole for non ulcer dyspepsia so wasn't keen to be on another potentially lifelong drug.  However after last flare up I decided to give it a go.  I was prescribed 290 dose, the lower dose doesn't seem to be available here in UK?Initially not good with diarrhoea and slight loss of control so I gave up again for a month. Then thought t I'd experiment to lower the dose.  I started breaking up the capsule and would just take about a third of the powder in a small glass of water before breakfast, after a few days this was working well, though since then I've upped to half a capsule. Not very scientific I grant you but effectively now the same as taking a capsule every other day ( tried that but dose too much). 
I can now now go comfortably without taking any other meds or supplements other than a single stool softener every day.  Other than an occasional cramping and gurgling when I need to go it's pretty good indeed.  So what's my problem? Well the side effect for me is bloating! Worse than I ever had with normal constipation!  
I look, and feel, totally inflated round my stomach and some days my bra is sooo tight. It isn't constant but there more often than not. I had a CT scan during my latest flare up which was fine so no concerns about other organs.  So it's down to the bowels and the Constella.  Abdominal distension is certainly given as a recognised side effect.  Can anyone on the drug relate to this?  I wonder did the bloating put people off continuing with the drug?  
Its so so frustrating as the drug clearly does work for me, as long as I half the dose, but the bloating is annoying. I'm continuing for now as the joy of not having to take anything else to go daily is obviously great,but if anyone can suggest ways to manage the bloat I'd be interested. My GI doc was unconcerned and just said it was great I was going without laxitives for the first time in years. I'm also really annoyed I can just get the 145 mcg dose. It only seems to be in US.

"Hello,
Over the past 7/8 months i have slowly been developing some constipation issues. I have always been regular and never had any issues like this until around October last year.
I have been back and forth to my gp and all I was ever recommended and prescribed was laxatives and buscopan. The past few months this has got worse and my gp has mentioned is does sound ibs related but its always constipation and never anything else.
I have tried to stay away from as many wheat products as possible even though im not celiac and eating mote vegetables and a healthier diet. drinking more water etc... but nothing really seems to make a difference. I seem to have stomach ache everyday, sometimes its above my bellybutton and other times its lower.
I do have brief periods of relief but I've never really been able to find a trigger for what is setting my symptoms off.
I do have an appointment coming up from gastro so im waiting to see what happens there but I just feel like im alone with this! Does anyone else share similar symptoms??
Im 25 if that helps.

"Hi everyone, i don't really know where to start. I've been suffering now for about a month, maybe two from hard stools, which then caused Haemorrhoids or anal fissure or at least that's what i think it is (only spoke to the Dr over the phone, they somehow diagnosed me with this that way) and i have had bright red blood in the water when going to the toilet on 3 occasions but this must have been around 2 weeks ago now when i was in extreme pain going to the toilet, i have since been using stool softeners in DulcoEase and i have been going better to the toilet and in less pain and no bleeding since. But in the top left section of my stomach, there seems to be what feels like knots in my stomach, almost like knotted muscles and i get like a stitch type pain with it sometimes but unsure whether its muscular or not. i have also had very light coloured stools over the past few days, and a very gurgly tummy when eating and going to the toilet. i am constantly worrying that this is something very serious as in bowel cancer/colon cancer etc, and not really getting anywhere with the drs either, can anyone shed any light onto this with any similar experiences at all?

"hi there. im 24, female, only history of cancer in family is my aunt had cervical, nan breast and aunt on my dads side has breast. since about august ive noticed significant weight loss. i got invisalign so some could be due to that. but my weight fluctuated from around 9 st 6lbs to 9st, then 8st 13lbs last month.
i had stabbing pains in my mid left back that started a few weeks ago, i used to suffer low left back pain on and off but this felt deep and a bit higher. it hurt so much i was scared something inside was throbbing and when i ate lunch i had to sit down as i had pain wrapping round my abdomen and was worried something in my back was going to burst so i went to a and e and was given a blood test which was fine. i had dinner that night and was in pain again quite bad but had voltarol on my back and calmed down.
i started getting upper back pain between my shoulder blades recently and feel occasional pain in my left ribs near my stomach. i got so obsessed with checking my stomach for pain i have kept pressing it and now its tender. i have extreme health anxiety because i saw about pancreatic cancer a week and a half ago and since then i feel like im feeling more symptoms.
i have been doing yellowish brown stools often. soft too. occasionally followed by yellowish mucus. i have also completely lost my appetite this week and i saw i was 8st 8lbs yesterday. i am so worried. all my bowel muscles hurt and i am getting pain round my pelvis, in my ribs and back and chest and shoulders.
i get a heavy painful ache in my back and tummy sometimes and my heart feels like its beating fast. my doctor has put me on beta blockers and antidepressants last week. i paid for an ultrasound and they couldnt see the pancreas tail but could see some of it and what they could see was fine but i know people miss things.
i am scared i could have a tumour on the tail where no one can see it. i managed to make myself eat a chocolate bar today then after 20 mins came over feeling so sick i had to lay down.
i have to make myself eat by swallowing the food with water and am only managing actimels, a banana, piece of toast or something a day.
im so scared the doctors are overlooking my issues and im going to die. i know hypochondria can make you feel symptoms but i dont get why my poo is yellowish. my last brown poo was frothy diarrhoea last week and since then soft yellow stools that smell sort or nutty/fishy. (sorry thats gross). i pass wind on the loo alot and i did have issues with poo before where i would get caught short and need to go. but not this often and not yellow. as well as flaky bits in the loo.
im so scared as i keep feeling pain in my ribs And dont want to lose anymore weight. i had a ca-19 blood test today and even as i type im feeling pain pushing on my right below my breast bone. i am on constant alert. im so scared my health is going to decline.
my doctor said she has been a gp for years and wants to reassure me i am fine im just stressed and anxious. she put me on omeprazole so my tummy burns less and the heavy back ache is less. ketones were also found in one of my last urine tests.
do i sound genuinely ill with this or just very anxious? poo pics below.

"Hi, I am on Paroxetine 5 MG for my anxiety and 2 BP meds. I am also taking nortriptyline 10 mg for last 2.5 years for my IBS and headaches. However, intrestingly, a lot of my IBS symptoms went away after a sinus surgery. My doc doesn't believe in it, but I do. I believe inflammation was the case for my sinus problems and opening the nasal channels helped my IBS as well.
So, I am trying to taper off my nortriptyline 10 Mg i've been on for last 2.5 years. I tried it once in December last year, but went back after being quite anxious after withdrawal. I want to try this again now, i am planning to do nortriptyline every other day and Ashwaganda during the days not on nortriptyline. Planning to do this schedule for next 3 weeks and I am really hoping that I can get off this medication.
Looking forward to your experience and if anyone was on similar boat as me.

"Hi
I have had diarrhoea since December.
My GP knows
She ordered 2 stool tests, one postal to get tested at lac, and one to go to surgery, both came back negative.
I had blood tests last week and am going to the doctor in 2 days to discuss results.
I had blood tests before for diarrhoea, as the GP thought i might have coeliac, that came back negative.
I started on one imodium a day but now I need 3
I am worried i will need a colonoscopy, i cannot take sedation as i am weaning off a benzodiazepine under medical supervision and a sedative will interfere with the taper.
I cannot stand the smell of nitrous oxide, (gas and air), i am autistic and this is probably why i hate the smell.
I hope a colonoscopy is not needed.
I have never had diarrhoea for this long since a few years ago, and an increase in my oestrogen part of my hrt cured it, however, this caused bleeding, the hrt was reduced and the diarrhoea did not return as the menopause symptoms got better.
I am not worried about cancer, but the diarrhoeais getting worse and i worry about incontinence.
I have chronic stress, the cause of which can not just be taken away, so i am terrified.
The BRAT diet sounds too low in nutrition.
Any help appreciated.
PS I am from the uk so use the NHS

"Hello Everyone, just want to know if anyone experiencing IBS kinda symptoms? I got covid 2 months ago, 1st week was okay, some mild symptoms - cold, cough then there on for about 4 week, I had severe fatigue (only on sunday), then I took the booster shot (already got 2 vac shots earlier) and that week after a few days got should pain and then back pain. All this time i was taking a lot of cold, cough, and pain killers. In January at some point, i saw blood on my toilet paper but it happened only once and never happened after that but I felt i was having hard stools. A few weeks ago, got frequent urination, took antibiotics, had kidney, bladder ultrasound done - all came negative. that same week started having bowel issue. Constipation (hard stools), bloating, gas. Took Colace and Metamucil - no improvement. Stopped Metamucil and had 3 tablets of Colace (along with fiber via salads) and after 3 day i got stools but flat stools. I don't no what's going on with my health. Do you think its IBS caused by covid? Anybody experienced these symptoms. I appreciate you response. Thanks.

"Hi,
Clutching at straws here. Has anyone found any good places/websites for food intolerance testing? I'm in the UK, in Glasgow.
In going issue with severe nausea and loose bowels for almost 3 years. Can't for the life of me work out what I am eating. Kept food diaries, makes no difference. Can eat the food one week and be fine, the next not. Then I go back several days and can't see anything.
Or does anyone have an intolerance to modified ingredients in foods? Or fortified foods? I don't know if it's something like that even? But even that I can eat something with
modified maize starch In it and feel awful then eat something else with it in it and be fine?! So confused and helpless.
Had so many tests done but showed nothing. Only test not done is colonoscopy.
Thanks in advance!

"Hi all. I have been suffering with pain in upper left abdomen below the ribs for 7 months now. I've had loads of tests and nothing has come back showing anything. Had faecal calprotectin test done and that was normal so the docs have not done an endoscopy. Sometimes the pain ramps up to where I can constantly feel it and I can agrivate it with movement such as twisting or stretching Other times it just rumbles along and I hardly notice it but it's always there. Do any of you guys ever get this?
The best way that I can explain the location of the pain is like this. Make a fist with your left hand and place it half way down your left rib line just underneath. Where your little finger rests is where the pain is mostly. I does travel about a little bit but it's mostly there. This normal for ibs?

"Hello everyone!
I have suffered from ibs-c since I was very young but after changing my diet (increasing fiber, minimizing dairy, drinking more water) I started passing stool regularly with normal consistency.
However, since a few months ago, whenever I pass stool, the beginning is always small hard pebbles but is then followed by normal soft stool.
I dont have any other symptoms and can usually pass stool daily.
Does anyone know what such stool with mixed consistency is called? Should I be worried or is it likely just IBS?
Thank you in advance!

"I'm a 49 year old male and my symptoms started 5 weeks ago; I actually had pain and burning sensations that seemed to radiate from my bladder/groin on my lhs and round to my flank/back. Dr thought it was a kidney infection/stones so I was prescribed antibiotics. over the course of the next couple of weeks I had 3 urine tests (all clear) and a ct scan of my kidneys/bladder which came back as normal.
The symptoms have persisted over the last few weeks but my discomfort/burning is mainly around the lower left side of my abdomen (below belly button) and sometimes up towards my stomach too. in addition to this I've been getting regular headaches and waves of feeling pretty tired too.
I have now been prescribed mebeverine as my GP thinks it could be IBS and also Omeprazole for the indigestion I've been getting as they think I could also have GERD.
I had a blood test last week and am still awaiting those results.
A few questions please;
Does this sound potentially like IBS?
Do any IBS sufferers out there also suffer with GERD-like symptoms? is it common for the two to be linked?
is it common for IBS gut pains to feel like they're in specific parts of the gut (mine does) or is it usually generally more a general feeling across the whole gut?

"Hello All! I'm new to this forum and could use some advice. I'm a 65yo male generally in good health, regularly exercise with no underlying disorders and no genetic pre-dispositions (I won the lottery as both grandfathers lived into their 90s with no apparent health problems!)
I've joined this forum to get feedback on a current situation that has stymied me, I'll explain.
I was on a cross-country bicycling tour, nothing crazy 50-70miles per day and noticed a slight pain in my lower abdomen/ upper intestine with mild to strong constipation if I don't drink tons of water, and I'm managing. But, this is something that has never occurred to me before, as I eat well lots of fruit and vegies don't use alcohol and I've seen a doctor who ruled out Diverticulitis with blood tests, but the condition persists. There's really only one more symptom besides constipation, that is I have occasional dizzy spells that I've never experience before.
 This whole experience has got me stymied because I'm in good health, exercise and never experienced something like before. I'm hoping to get some insights from people who might have experienced a similar situation and the next suggested steps (before I return to see the doctor).
Thanks and be well!!  JohnG

"I was diagnosed of having IBS after 2-3 months with abdominal pain, gassiness, and alternations between Lumpy - Fine - Watery loose. I took Mebeverine for two weeks, and it did actually get better. Overall cramps and pain are reduced, back pain got lost, and I overall felt better. That was until I stopped taking Mebeverine, the day later in the morning, I experienced gassiness. Had a dump in the morning, which looked really long and big, but perfectly fine. But after that, I then started to keep going back to the bathroom, and all my stools during the 5 times of those sessions, I only got watery loose stools and 6/10 rate of lower abdominal pai. , The stool looked like it was mixed with black stuff that floats around the toilet, some even have flakes and pieces and such. Which made me conclude this can't be blood and are only from the leaves I had the day before. Moving on, I began to anticipate where I mostly experience abdominal pain, which turns out.. I think it most of the time hurts specifically very near the hole of my belly button to the upper left. Does IBS cause pain in a specific area like this? Also when it does cause pain and I touch it, Kinda hurts too. I also have these "" flair-ups "" whenever I sleep on a cold night without sheets. Are my experiences typical of IBS even? Thanks in advance for those who will respond.

"Hi,
I am looking for people who experienced interactions either with antidepressants or beta-blockers while taking Mebeverine daily. When you read the patient leaflet, there is nothing said about any interactions (I am not talking about alergic reactions to Mebeverine).
It is difficult for me to accept there are none because Mebeverine acts on our intestines and there is a lot going on there not only with food but also with any medication we take every day.
I seem to have some symptoms but I am not sure if they are due to Mebeverine.
I am just putting a question forward to anyone who has/had any side effects either: taking Mebeverine and beta-blockers or taking Mebeverine and antidepressants. I do not mean taking them together at the same time, but on the same day, let's say 2-4 hours between them.
What were your experiences like?
Thank you.

"I’m 23 male and for the pass 4+ weeks my stools have been small, broken up, soft and occasionally diarrhea, never constipated. I also experienced burning sensations in my stomach or tightness that comes and goes but not often. I don’t have cramps, pain or a fever and no family history of colon cancer and in 2020 went to the hospital for separate reasons and had blood test and a X-rays if that’s important or worth mentioning. Is this IBS or something else? I’m eating regularly but when it’s time to go my bowels seems incomplete. Funny enough this actually started with me stressing about dry skin on my hands which lead to anxiety and frequently urination that caused me to freak about a UTI but that has completely stopped. Maybe they’re connected?

"For 18 months I have had various symptoms - trapped bowel wind, wind, pain usually caused by wind just about anywhere, occasional tenesmus, changes from fast motility to slow e.g I can urgently need a bowel movement (large) after my first cup of coffee on a morning, or when slow will sometimes be constipated or not have a b.m for hours and then just a small one. Some days I am symptom free. I don't have bleeding or diarrhea. I kept a food diary but without any conclusion as I can eat the same things from week to week with different outcomes
I've seen my g.p and had 2 fit tests, full blood counts, test for coeliac disease, abdominal ultrasound, calprotectin test and 4 years ago gastroscopy as I suffer from acid stomach. Last week I had a sigmoidoscopy, I had to stop it half way through because I was in so much pain from the air they were pumping into me. My bowel cannot cope with excess air/gas. Was offered colonoscopy but would find prep for that really difficult both because of acid stomach problems, fasting and the laxatives and because of the diet leading up to it - I am vegetarian and most of my diet would be banned i.e wholemeal, veg, fruit etc. After having the sigmoidoscopy I don't think I could handle a colonoscopy!
Has anyone had similar symptoms? I feel I'm left to work this one out on my own.

"It all started October 2017. I went to the emergency room because of constipation. Ok. Nothing happened really they gave me a suppository and sent me on my way. After that my bowel would change from being constipated to diarrhea. Before this normally I had a bowel maybe 2 or 3 times a week. I ended up loosing 35 pounds. Going from 187 to 153 in a period of 3 months. That was 2 years ago I lost the weight. I currently am 159. I have to go to the bathroom now 3-5 times a day and they are all loose stools. I haven't had a solid poop in idk how long. I also rarely have an appetite and I feel full. As to before I used to eat a lot now I get nauseated with the thought of food. Im nauseous everyday now for 3 years. I have these symptoms : Bowel change, nauseous, loss of appetite ,weight loss, hot flashes, rashes that come and go, chest pain, back pain, itchy armpits, irritability, fatigue, stomach aches, and headaches. All the test they have done and still haven't found anything. So one doctor is treating me as I have irritable bowel syndrome but I feel different. I just want to go back to my normal lifestyle. My left breast also hurts but that is of recently and I have not told my doctors because I feel they would dismiss it like everything else. Any suggestions on what I should do for help? I'm tired of being sick everyday.

"Hi all,
I've had IBS for around 10 years now, and am pretty good at 'identifying' those symptoms and what that means etc. However, I have been suffering a lot recently with terrible nausea and bloatedness, and acute stomach pain which is different from my usual stomach cramps that I get with an episode of IBS. Another difference is that I get constipated, rather than the opposite, which again comes with an episode of IBS. This has been going on for the past two years on and off, but since September of 2019 it became more constant. I have tried all sorts of diets (have cut out caffeine, only drink water, low FODMAP, no gluten or dairy) but whatever I eat causes me nausea and bloatedness. This nausea is debilitating - I have severe emetophobia and stop myself from vomiting but sometimes I wonder if it'd be better to vomit. I am now scared to eat because whatever I ingest causes me issues, and have lost weight. I'm worried about that I'm not eating enough vitamins.
Recently, I was diagnosed with hEhlers-Danlos and POTs syndrome, and have been trying to come to terms with it. When reading up on it, I saw that it can cause stomach issues, such as gastroparesis. I don't like to self-diagnose over the internet, but a lot of the symptoms matched. This feels different to my IBS episodes, and is constant (well, whenever I eat). I just wanted to see if anyone here with IBS has the same, as all the people I talk to that I know with IBS say that their main symptoms are stomach cramps, diarrhoea etc which this isn't. I will make an appointment to see the doctors but I don't know if it's worth pushing for further testing - on the one hand I want to be able to eat and become healthy again, but on the other I don't want to go through more testing for them to tell me it's just IBS.

"So i've had Acid reflux for 7 months, stomach problems for 5 
the issues are daily and my symptoms consist of
- Constant, excessive burping
- Soft, Sticky, Messy stools often 
- A burning type of discomfort in the abdomen which is often relived by the passing of the soft, sticky, messy stool
- Heartburn
- Acid reflux (a burning sour taste in my throat)
- Occasional upper abdomen pain
- recurring bouts of diarrhea
I've had 2 stool samples a blood test and a colonoscopy, all coming back clear.
I was placed on PPI's which have helped with the sour burning taste from the acid reflux and it has eliminated the hearburn 
The diarrhea is less often because i've changed up diet and eliminated foods that made it worse 
However im still suffering with the constant excessive burping which is only helped by laying down. While the diarrhea is less common now i still get the weird burning sensation in my stomach that usually dissapears when i pass stool, and those stools are 95% of the time soft, messy and sticky
Are these common for IBS and GERD? my biggest concern is the fact that the burping is still persistant even after using PPI medication

"Hi All! Hoping you can shed some light for me on IBS symptoms vs. not IBS. Had an IBS-D flare up that started about 2 weeks ago, but seems to have evolved into different symptoms. My pain throughout this flare up has mostly been under my ribs on left side (like a protrusion or a stitch) and up into my upper left back (like a gnawing deep strain type feeling). The pain moves and changes down through my abdomen to just above my left hip and does seem to provide some (though not a lot of) relief after a BM. Abdominal cramping accompanies this, as well. Throughout this process, I have had dull kidney (upper back) and flank pain (like a sore, bruised, tender to the touch feeling-mostly left, some right) that comes and goes. I literally had no symptoms at all yesterday and then it  randomly decided to return this morning upon waking. Interestingly enough, my BMs were firming up today. As a side note, I have also been having trace blood in my urine and urinary frequency (x 1 yr), which I understand is normal with IBS. My bloodwork has been normal, nothing in urine (other than trace blood), physical exam normal (including when physician thumps you on the back where kidneys are), had a CT scan November 2016 (negative) and I had gall bladder removal 11 years ago. Doc ordered another Abdominal/Pelvic CT which I am waiting to hear back for scheduling. My question is...are there any of you IBS sufferers out there that have IBS pains that were mistaken for kidney issues? Do you have the kidney area pain I described above? When I looked up kidney issues, it stated that most of the time the pain is severe and intense and accompanied by fevers and such. This pain is somewhat uncomfortable, but I would say 3/10 on the pain scale- not severe at all and no fevers. My mind is racing with negative thoughts and I'm hoping nothing more is going on. Can someone shed some light on these symptoms?

"Hello everyone, I've not officially been diagnosed, but my GP did suggest that I might have ibs following a colonoscopy some years ago ( nothing nasty found, thank goodness ).
My problem is that I'm waking early day after day, absolutely bursting with wind. This is always followed by a bm, after that the rest of the day is normal.
Like many people, I'm feeling dreadfully stressed these days, for several reasons beyond my control. Maybe that has some influence.
Changing the way I eat makes no difference, I thought maybe I could be sensitive to wheat or dairy, but cutting them down hasn't helped. The absolutely worst thing is cooked tomatoes of any kind, soup, pasta sauce or even pizza, the morning wind after eating them is agonising.
Does anyone else get this ? Any suggestions to stop this ?

"Hello there,
I have not passed a bowel in almost 3 days now, and am getting really nervous. Today is Friday, and I have not went since Tuesday night. Constipation started on Wednesday, and it was because I was really stressed for an upcoming event on Wednesday night, and on top of that I have had a ton of school work. I can't seem to shake the stress, and now am becoming more and more stressed because of the constipation. I've had issues with IBS flare ups before, and they always seem to pass, but was just wondering any tips or tricks people have to help me either relieve the constipation or calm down.

"I've been struggling for a number of weeks now. Started with a sharp pain in my belly button and a full feeling over my abdomen, went for an examination and was told it could be a hernia, this did seem to be logical as i had felt sore after a big gym session at CrossFit, however, my symptoms soon went apart from a pinching feeling on my right flank that came and went over a period of a month or two.
Fast forward to today, I've been in agony with excessive wind, loose stooles and constipation for around a week. Ive also noticed that when i pass a stool it burns in my rectum beforehand and afterwards.
Could this be IBS? in hindsight, I've always had issues with my stools being loose- i dont always have the best diet! However, up until this year, i have never had other symptoms- which, this week have left my bedridden!!!

I tested positive for SIBO, took antibiotics which made things worse and then tested negative for SIBO at a later date.
Gastroenterologist has said it’s likely to be severe post infection IBS and to stop Citalapram 40mg and gone onto amitriptyline 10mg. I’ve done this cold Turkey (different issue).
Has anyone tried this and how long did it take to see an improvement if any? I’ve only been off Citalopram for two weeks so aware it’s very early days.

"So, I've been struggling for a few years trying to figure out why my stomach is sometimes an issue. I'll have diarrhea, severe cramping sometimes, etc. Now, about 3 weeks ago, I started becoming nauseous every day. It's mainly at night where it happens and it seems to be depending on what I eat. Most nights I have a little sickness, but I'll eat an Upspring candy that soothes my stomach or a Tums. Other nights I almost feel like throwing up, but instead, I have diarrhea and the nausea goes away mostly and I can sleep. I don't feel like myself anymore and now I'm terrified to eat dinner. I'm beginning to refuse to eat meals or just eating smaller meals. So far, it's white rice, possibly pizza, ground turkey meat and taco seasoning that causes the severe symptoms.
I did have diverticulitis in 2020, which was surprising to the doctors since I'm so young. I'm not sure if this diverticulitis again, but with different symptoms and very little pain or my IBS flaring up. I'm now getting chills all the time and my hands and feet are always ice cold. It's hard to warm them up sometimes. I went through so many things and we're not even sure if it's 100% IBS.
They've tested me for celiac three times, I'm drinking lactose free milk which didn't really improve anything. They thought maybe IBS, but my heart doctor wants them to look into me possibly having Crohn's. Then the entire diverticulitis thing that had happened. I'm not even sure what to eat anymore. Do I just eat normally and slowly discover my trigger foods and start crossing them out? I don't want to feel sick anymore. I'm getting an appointment with my GI, but it may be a little while until I can see her. I'm completely at a loss of what to do till then.

After 10 years of classic diarrhoea IBS it took a turn into chronic constipation. until later year (I am now 45). I had a week of loose diarrhoea and was told it was an ibs flare up due to stress of lockdown. my husband was then diagnosed with a rare brain disease and lots of other stress in the mix I won't go into. In Nivember out of nowhere I had occasional diarrhoea which would somewhat affect my day. I went to GP who done bloods and stool sample for bacteria and all clear. Although it didn't go away it settled somewhat but bare in mind I was taking co codamol for a trapped nerve in shoulder. 2 weeks ago I woke up suddenly at 6 in the morning with stomach cramps 6 hours later 3 bouts if diarrhoea then nothing til Monday afternoon. Since thne diarrhoea has goy increasingly worse and going 5-7 tines a day and unable to go out due to feeling like I Always need the toilet. It's really getting me down now I have long term GAD and health anxiety and my doctor has just done tge FIT test and IBD stool test and I'm panicking that this is something more as surely IBS cannot have you having diarrhoea constant like this for weeks no quality if life...Thanks for reading

"I ended up in so much pain after a bowel movement that I needed to take diazepam to try to calm the spasms down. I thought I was going to pass out with the pain. I've been twice this week to the doctors because of the pain and a very thick green mucous & nausea. They gave me peppermint pills then colofac. Neither of which has helped. My bowel movements are always of normal consistency - I don't get diahorroea or constipation yet they're saying it's ""just IBS"" (I had colonoscopy biopsies that suggested historic inflammation consistent with IBD and fecal calprotectin with raised inflammation markers. I take immunosuppressants for another condition & all the time I was on steroids -2.5y- I had no symptoms, it's returned since being off steroids but consultant said IBS so they stick with that) .
I had to stop my partner rushing me into A&E today because of the pain as I thought they'd laugh at the silly woman with IBS who can't even poo without fainting. The diazepam is now working and I can straighten up (well lie flat as I'm now fleeing) Is this normal for ibs? I thought you got D or C with it.
Can anyone suggest something I can do to stop the pain of pooing as this happened when I was in a cafe in town & I could barely walk to the car to get home.

It comes and goes like wave like sensation. 
My question is there really any connections at all between bowls syndrome and testicular pain? 
If anyone has similar symptoms pls share your experience.
Thanks

"Hi all!
Ok here's my story: (I'm 47 now and a male)
From what my mother tells me I've had stomach issues since I was 5. She tells me about stories of me being on the toilet crying because of the pain. My own memory of my stomach issues is sitting in class in high school having a very loud and embarrassing talking stomach. I remember the occasional bouts of diarrhea with pain as well.
But the most significant memories start in my 20's. A night of drinking with my friends was disastrous for me later that night or more normally the very next day. Horrible cramping and lots of diarrhea. I would also get horrible cramping out of nowhere and then diarrhea. I'm assuming it was food based but could never really pin point it to anything.
In my early 30's I had a long bout of stomach issues with cramping and diarrhea that wouldn't go away. They did a CT scan and saw what they thought was bowel wall thickening. My doctor called to tell me I most likely had crohn's disease. However, after going through a colonoscopy with multiple biopsies I was told that I didn't have crohn's or UC or anything else. They were kind of stumped. This really started a whole issue of health anxiety for me that helped me to accumulate multiple ER visits and many many CT scans.
Recently I've had a CT scan of my abdomen (not pelvis) and everything was normal aside from a few tiny liver cysts. I also had an upper endoscopy as I was having a feeling of something in my throat. All was normal save for some gastritis most likely caused by bile regurgitation since I had no signs of gerd. All biopsies taken from the esophagus, stomach and duodenum were all negative.
What I've been presenting with for the past month and a half, aside from the feeling of something in my throat, is feeling as if something is in my rectum. If I pass gas the feeling goes away momentarily. I've also had more of an urge to pee. I've had a mixture of diarrhea but it's been mostly solid with bits of undigested food like peanuts and quinoa and tomato skins. I'm not getting the awful cramps I did in my younger days but I've had intermittent pain across and just below my belly button and then down the left side. I also feel gas or something squirting through different parts of my intestines even in my rectum. Sometimes it feels like I have gas in there but it just kind of magically dissipates. I had a DRE done which was normal as well as a fecal occult blood test which was negative. I've had multiple urinalysis which were all normal and three sets of blood work which were also all normal.
Oh by the way, this whole episode started almost two months ago with me trying to get in shape. I lost 12ish pounds in about 2 weeks but cutting down on how much I ate, when I ate and moved from all the crap I was eating to fruits and oatmeal. I also added in a weigh lifting routine. I also added in come creatine and nitro booster. (just a couple of doses each) So I started at 221 lbs and went down to about 208. I'm now 203 because for the last month I've had no appetite.
In december of last year I had the worst case of diarrhea I've ever had. The stuff that was coming out was disgusting. Mucous like I've never seen. That went away after about a week and a half and stayed away until April when I got my first covid shot. Then I had diarrhea for a few days which then went away until about a month ago.
My doctor wants me to get a handle on my anxiety regarding all of this and doesn't think it's necessary to push for a colonoscopy at this time. That's the sentiment of my GP and my GI doc.
So what does everyone think? Possible IBS?

"Hi everyone. I am female and have had ibs since I was 15-16 years old, I am now 35. I get diarrea and bloating mainly but sometimes can get constipation. If I lift something too heavy I feel like I have \""strained\"" my stomach and the pain starts. Sometimes I think it is related to food. I have fainted every now and then, sometimes 8-10 months apart since the age of 15. About a month ago I woke in the night with severe pain and usual pattern, I get to the loo but have trouble passing anything. I start to sweat loads, go hot and cold, vision starts to go and next thing I come round on the floor. I get up shaky and cold needing to go to the loo. Last time I hit my head on the sink which scared me but I was lucky that my husband was home at the time. Last night I woke (1.30am) with severe pain, went to the loo, managed to pass something, pain started, hadn't woke my husband so knew i had to get to the bedroom to get help. He is not sure if I fainted. I only remember needing to get to the bedroom and next thing being aware that my head was on the doorstep and my husband asking what I needed, as in medicine/help. I have medicine called Viadil Forte that I use (It relaxes stomach) but I am not getting the warning that I used to so am not always able to use it before I pass out. Some doctors say oh its ibs, another has said no definetely not and yet another says it is the pain that causes me to faint not ibs. Does anyone else pass out with ibs? Please help me, it gets me down so much.

"My problem started 4 months ago when I had a bad cough for a couple of days, my voice went abit then the following week I developed a really dry mouth and a thick yellow coating on my tongue. My mouth and throat was so dry I could only eat fruit and yogurt. I developed really bad indigestion pretty much after everything I ate, it was so bad sometimes I thought I was going to be sick. This all led me to lose about a dress size in weight as I could hardly eat. 
I went to the doctor who had a look at my mouth and diagnosed it as oral thrush. So I was given a weeks course of nystatin. This didn't really have any effect until the last couple of days when it seemed to go abit patchier. So I booked another appointment this time with a different doctor, she ordered blood tests and gave me lansoprazole for the indigestion. The blood tests all came back normal. So she then put me on fluconazole to see if that would clear up the oral thrush and took a swab of my tongue to send off for testing. The fluconazole had no effect and the results came back inconclusive. So I tried nystatin this time for 2 weeks, again it went patchier but didn't go completely. I had another swab test taken and this came back + for candida. She then referred me to an ENT specialist who had a look, put a camera up my nose and said it looked like a normal tongue coating and was probably caused by acid reflux!! It's not normal!! 
So this has been going on for 4 months now, the dryness has got better I can actually eat most things now but the coating is still there. The indigestion has mostly gone. I've still not put the weight back on though and have been quite constipated throughout it all. I also feel very bloated and burp a lot still. There almost feels like there's air under my rib cage all the time. I'm just stuck as to what to do as my doctor told me it was oral thrush and then the ENT specialist said it wasn't?!!! Help!!

"Hope you could provide some advice for me. I'm 33 years old, have been back and forth to the doctors for years now with changes in bowel habit, lower abdominal pain which is usually in my right side and nausea. My stools range from mushy to explosive smelly diarrhea I seem to have peaks and troughs with symptoms, I can go without them for weeks but then they can return with avengence. The symptoms all seem to run with anxiety with me which I suffer with quite a bit. This week the pain in my right abdomen has woken me up in the night, painkillers don't seem to touch it but then it will ease on its own after a few days.
I've had blood and stool samples, 2 ultrasounds and a colonoscopy and everything has returned negative. The doctors have said that its highly likely that its IBS. I'm just wondering should I push for an MRI/CT scan or is a colonoscopy pretty definitive and I shouldn't worry?
I feel awful posting this, but I'm just bereft with worry. I have these procedures done but theres no follow up from the GP, just told its negative

"Hi, 
My stool is sticky, so what will help soluble or insoluble fiber (or something completely different?). 
I've read that ""Soluble fiber attracts water and turns to gel during digestion. This slows digestion."" and slowing digestion I think should make stool less watery since there's more time for water to be absorbed, meaning soluble fiber is better, correct? 
Thanks!

"I have digestive problems for 10 years already.
It started as an intolerance to meat and fried foods, especially with proteic ones.
I have done endoscopy (both of them), CT scans, MRI's and everything seems fine.
The only thing that was wrong in the studies is a slightly high level of bilirubin (this abnormal result came always like that) but the liver enzymes are well too.
Today is that im having trouble eating meat, I get diarrhea and the abdomen on the right side below the ribs swells and it hurts a lot, if I eat more meat or take some medication after that, I start vomiting and don't stop until I get injected with metoclopramide.
I would like to know if anyone else has had similar problems or have any suggestions.

"Hi,
I have been taking Mebeverine 135mg tablets for about 8 weeks now. I suffered from bad bloating, intestinal pain and bad winds, particularly in the evening. It has been like that for years.
GP offered me the Mebeverine which I gladly took. As I am sensitive to medicines, herbs and chemicals (not allergic, just sensitive) I started with 1 tablet a day. This was working fine at first. I also take a low dose of beta-blocker each day (I am in my fifties). All bloating, pain and wind stopped, I felt like a human again.
However, in the past week or so I noticed that my blood pressure was going up from normal to 135-85, joint by headaches in the afternoons, sometimes at night too. This was not normal for me! I am thinking about giving up Mebeverine and start checking my blood pressure.
I wonder if anyone experienced increase in blood pressure while on Mebeverine. This side-effect seems to be mentioned only by professional medical journal articles online. Incidentally, insomnia is another side-effects mentioned while on Mebeverine. I wonder if there are other medicines to help IBS (without diarrhoea). Take care, B.

"Hi All,
New here. 38-year old male, somewhat overweight. Not new to bowel issues, anxiety, and depression. About a month ago, I started having an immediate urge to ise the restroom 30-60 minutes after my first meal. It is a very loose movement and then I am good for the rest of the day. Just a bit of gas after dinner. I have been dealing with IBS-D issues my whole life. I just havent had it persist this long.
I should mention, I had my gallbladder removed 10-months ago. I have been pretty good since. However, I have read issues like this (especially with IBS) are likely to develop, especially in males under 50.
My doctor took full blood work and all came back normal. I did the occult fecal blood test and all is good. There will be occasions, a couple times a week, were I have a very good BM.
However, I have myself so worked up, that I am dry heaving, crying, ect........
Any thoughts on this?

"I'm 54 years old. For the past 25 years, I've had acid reflux issues and was on Prevacid or some other type of prescription medicine to help. The acid was starting to cause my throat to get really pink so my E.N.T. highly recommended that I see a specialist to get a Nissen Fundoplication. Which I did. And honestly, it didn't hell all that much. Within the last 3-4 years, I started getting really really bad lower abdominal and intestinal pain from time to time. I don't ""go"" as often as most. I discussed this with my doctor and she said I most likely had IBS. Once or twice the pain was so bad, she prescribed Xifaxan. And that worked like a charm. Around 3 years ago, I had an attack that came on where I got very dizzy and felt even disoriented. My heart started racing. And even started to shake uncontrollably. Arms and legs. That episode lasted about 30-45 minutes. I was at work at the time so a co-worker had to drive me home. I wrote it off as food poisoning at the time. It happened again about 9 months after that. Then again 6 months after that. And it is increasing. Every few months. This week, it happened TWICE! Two days in a row.  Every time this occurs, I also have a lot of gas swirling around in my intestines. Making all sort of sounds. I've discussed this with not only my primary doctor but my Gastro doctor too. I get upper endoscopes every few years because of my history with acid reflux and had my last one last Spring. No real issues or polyps. My stomach was also slightly pinkish in certain areas.  Here's my question, what if anything can I take to stop this from happening? I have to get a handle on this. What in the world would cause your body to shake like that? When it happens, it is quite scary. I'm talking with my doctor again about it this week. This has to stop.  Thanks in advance for listening and for any advice.

I am a 19 year old male and yesterday and today ive had too poops that i posted below. i have really bad health anxiety so this is worrying me a lot. Sometimes my poop looks like this and sometimes it doesnt. also sometimes after i poop ill have to wipe again and itll have yellow parts in it. This has been happening for months but i havent worried about it until reading about it. ive heard of things like colon and pancreatic cancer and im scared i could have that. i also eat a lot of fast food which i hope contributes to these things. i know im really young and its not likely that i have cancer but im still scared. ive also heard of ibs which im hoping is all this is. could anybody please help me with this because im really worried about it and havent eaten much because of it. ive been to two doctors and one said it was anxiety and the other gave me laxatives. i guess what im trying to say is that if i had cancer ir something like that i would be losing a lot if weight and before i started worrying about it i was eating and not losing weight. Could the yellow stuff mean that cancer has spread or is this all a ibs/diet/anxiety thing? any help would be greatky appreciated. thanks.

"I can feel something protruding after I have a bowel movement, it usually goes back in afterwards. I have consulted a doctor, its difficult to recreate a scenario, in which the prolapse can be observed by a doctor. The doctor thinks, it might be a prolapse of the rectal mucosa. Whatever it is, he says, surgery is risky and nothing much can be done about it.
It doesn't usually bothers me, but it is annoying, because it feels like there is stool still stuck to the anus and it itches really bad sometimes.

"let me just start by saying i never had stomach problems before. i am a 35 year old male who has been anxious his whole life. Well this year i was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic. i started taking metformin. I quit taking it about 25 days ago because of GI issues. Two days after quitting i had my last bout of diarhhea. Only problem is it wouldnt stop. I kept going for about twelve hours i must have went about 15 times and at the end it was only a small amount of clear liquid absolutely clear like water. Sorry if TMI. well for about a week later i lost my appetite and kept burping fast forward to now three weeks later my stomach is still in knots and i am constipated i think my bowel movements are different and they are long and skinny. I havent had diarhea since that day. My dr started the test. i took an ultrasound Friday. It feels like my stomach cannot digest anything right now. i never had any nausea but i feel bloated and burp constantly and my stomach feels nervous. any advice would be greatly appreciated as to what this might be.

"Hello I'm 22f.
Can someone tell me if they have experienced similar things?
I have distant family history of cancer and specially pancreatic cancer.
I have been experiencing abdominal discomfort 1 year: I have also regularly took pain killer and muscle relaxants for my cervical spine issues
When I ate something the food wont stay in my stomach and I mostly vomited. This did not happen every day but I had periods.
Some mornings I had dull pain in my stomach area.
In August I had an attack of intense pain in my upper abdominal area, which was resolved by muscle relaxants and pain killers for 1-2 days.
I have loss of appetite most days but I have not lost any weight.
Around the beginning of December I had once again upper abdominal pain with nausea and intense burning in my throat and stomach.
I have other diagnosis and I cant tell if more happened since my hands are always hurting and thingling, and my legs started too to go numb.
I took antiacids and proton pomp inhibitors went to the ER since nothing helped.
And it was resolved for short time. I got Covid and I couldn't see any doctors for 2 weeks.
I had second attack with pain that is not resolving I take several medications.
I have been experiencing lower back pain and burning.
I have weakness and fatigue, my hands feel heavy.
Today i woke up with shoulder blade pain.
My urine is dark I found some dark blood in the stool.
During my gastroenterologist and ER visits i had the following done:
3 ultrasound's
2 normal
And on one of them was noted that the head of the pancreas was enlarged. After that I had the other two normal one's.
Blood work for pancreatic enzymes they came normal.
Ca19-9 is in normal range 6
CT scan with contrast of my abdomen they found small lession in my liver which was noted as probably a benign cyst.
I have anemia and my blood work was colorful, my bilirubin is normal.
I tested negative for H pylori and kalprotein.
My gastroenterologist wants me to go for hospital stay for endoscopy to see what's going on in me.
I have booked a checkup in a great nearby hospital and I will ask them for that.
The pain is stabbing like burning, these days when I inhale more I feel the sabbing in my lungs too.
Both of my shoulder blades are hurting and I cant stop thinking of the worst

"Hi, just a quick question, hope someone can give an opinion (first got IBS at 15, it continued mildly into my 20's. Almost 40 now and have mild bouts once in a blue moon). 
Can you tell me if fairly typical for IBS bowel movements to start out normally (as in shape and consistency) but then get rather runny/mushy for the last portion of the stool?
Essentially, I'm having a stool of two halves. The first half is OK but then I feel as if the rest of it is going to come out like mush, and it does. 
The only recent dietary change I've made is that I have started drinking warm water with a tablespoon of lemon juice or a lemon slice before bed. Previously I used to have a small glass of milk or tea. 
Thanks for any help.

"Firstly.....Happy New Year to you all.
I don't even know where to start as to what health complaints I have sigh
Brief background is that I have:
*Type 2 Diabetes (genetic tests confirm) very well managed so much so that blood tests would suggest I'm not.
*PCOS
*Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver
All three are related unfortunately.
Suffer with constipation since the birth of our youngest in December 2019. It's on and off constipated one minute the next it's literally like water. Sometimes I wake with a diarrhoea type cramp and boy do i have to go, and do go!
So the GP said I had IBS.
I've also not felt well on and off since having our youngest, just weak and flu like (that's the only way I can describe it). So.... my GP said I had either fibromyalgia or ME.
I've been fine and I've been doing a keto/low carb lifestyle for 3 months and ive lost 2 stone. I have been off it for a month as I got married and Christmas, but i shall be back on it soon hopefully. During this time stools were loose and a dash was needed, but i was eating lots of protein, cheese and veg. I had a terrible cold the first week of December (not covid) but it was awful and left me feeling very ill. Skip forwards to 22nd December I had my covid booster, come the 24th i felt fluy but I had an ache in my right side/flank very slightly. 25th I disnt feel great but plodded on. 26th I woke up in a cold sweat, had chills, and a slight temperature to which I put it down to the booster, however I really did have right flank pain. I decided to dip my urine out of curiosity and showed I had blood in my urine. I spoke with a 111 practitioner and they said I should be seen in out of hours.
Out of hours...... no examination, but took my temp (slightly high) and pulse. Dipped my urine and it showed blood and leukocytes this time. She said it was a classic uti symptoms and there was an infection. I queried this as I had no burning when I weed, no urgency to go, no cloudy urine, no odour etc. She said I had probably had it a few days and not realised. I asked what the right flank pain was and she said it could be going to my kidney. 3 day course of antibiotics normally but gave me 7. Advised if no better or worse to contact gp.
I had been on them 3 days and no better, felt like i had been thumped in the back. Contact my gp who wouldn't see me and told me to go to a&e which I did.
They checked my urine which was completely clear, ran bloods (no idea what) and I had a ct scan, again all were clear.
The a&e doctor said inflammatory marker was slightly slightly raised but he wasn't concerned. He said if there was an infection it could be that that was causing the pain.
So although it was good to hear things were clear I am still worried as no idea what this pain/discomfort is.
Prior to this episode (since xmas eve) I had an MRI scan on the 19th December (for back problems) and found out I have DDD which can and does cause lower back, hip and leg pain.
Is all of this to do with my back ? I am now worried, is it my liver or is it something else.
I had a whole range of bloods in November which were all clear and good etc.
The last 2 days my stomach has been so noisy... like really bad. I am constipated (like marbles) 1 piece of stools had mucus on which again i have and get but this had some blood within / on it, which wasn't dark. It was a one off and I've not seen anymore since.
I am now worried.
I am doing a stool sample and having bloods done, as I sent a message to my gp today to say about the noisy tummy and is it anything to sorry about etc. They literally just said we can do a sample and bloods.
This niggle/pain/discomfort on my right flank has literally come out of nowhere.
I don't know what i want any of you fine people to say really, perhaps I am here just to vent, or reassurance to find out if anyone else has had this it experienced similar.
Do those with IBS have constipation then loose like water ? Randomly out of the blue, no rhyme or reason to it? Do you have mucus on your stools ?

Ribcage discomfort, upper/middle and lower backache, cramping, bloated, constipation and stool changes. My stress levels and anxiety is through the roof because its a constant worry, its definitely affecting my everyday life because its like a dark cloud following me around because i cant accept that all of this can only be IBS. I'm moody, irritable, short tempered, distant, distracted. But all i get told is to try yoga, meditating and counselling. Good luck trying to get in with a counselor during a worldwide pandemic, so instead i just plod on each day and try and push it to the back of my mind. Does anyone who has been diagnosed with IBS suffer with these same symptoms and if so how do you manage and deal with it? Any help at this point would be appreciated

"Hello,
I'm a 32 year old male, in good shape. Since January 2021 I've had this dull ache in my stomach. It feels like my stomach is distended. It is a general pain (i.e. not localised) that sits just at the belly button level and radiates out from there. It feels a little like when you have a stomach bug maybe, like there is a knot in my belly. It gets worse after physical activity.
I have completely healthy bowel and urine movements, no diarrhoea, no constipation. No problem starting or stopping, no blood in my stool or urine. My diet is healthy, but diet/eating seems to have absolutely no impact on this pain. Whether I eat a little or lot, whether I eat healthy or junk food, bland or spicy the pain remains the same.
It is worst if I am sitting in a chair, it is more comfortable if I am standing or lying down. Nothing I do seems to have an impact on the pain, except that if I do anything physical it worsens it.
I might also add that this pain is coupled with a low level ache in my testicles. At first I approached these pains from the urology angle. I have seen a urologist and he performed a varicocelectomy as that was the only physical abnormality. It has made no difference. I'm now trying to attack this from the abdominal point of view (appointment with gastroenterologist in the coming weeks).
If I'm honest it sort of feels like there is something in there that is pushing on other stuff. If I was to discover that I had a tumour growing in there, or a swollen organ that was pushing on another organ, that wouldn't surprise me at all, that is sort of what it feels like. It might also explain the testicular pain, if something was pushing down onto my pelvic areas. However, what is strange is that there are no accompanying symptoms of the gut.
I'd be really appreciative to hear any comments or ideas about this? It is stopping me leading a normal life, I had to give up cycling (and all exercise tbh) which I loved, but more than that it stops me going out and enjoying myself, as it is hard to have fun when you are perpetual discomfort.
Thanks
Dan

"Hello I’m a 27 year old male.
My symptoms have been present for 2 weeks, this occurred after night of eating and drinking, and ever since the next morning that’s when all this occurred.
I have been having some, well let’s say discomfort in my abdomen. It feels almost as if I have a dull pressure feeling in my right side under heath my rib cage, sometimes on my upper right back. I also get a fullness feeling after eating.
My stools have also been irregular. Sometimes they are pencil thin, sometimes they are what I would call not particularly solid, but also not diarrhea.
This feeling usually occurs after I eat, and it intensifies as my body digests what I eat. I also have been more bloated than usual as well, and it feels as if I have trapped gas.
There has been no blood, no vomiting, no loss in weight. But I fear this is a obstruction in my colon, and this is cancer.

"I cannot get help for my stomach pain. It is so bad that I actually scream. It is so bad that I cannot move. I have been to drs and told it was just a virus or an infection. Trying tell me it is gas. The colonoscopy dr said it was IBS and I have a spastic colon. Then find out the results are inconclusive. I cannot take much more. This is such a severe pain. I have been given Dexilant , among others. There is no relief.

"Hi All-
Going on day 11 with unrelenting mid to upper back pain (and gas, bloating, and constipation). Occasionally, throughout the days I have gotten abdominal pains that can be anywhere from upper L abdomen under ribs to lower L pelvic area. The back pain concerns me the most. It literally feels like a sharp stabbing pain on my left side that starts from just to the left of my spine at my bra strap line and wraps around under my ribs. The most intense spot is my back, though. Almost like an intense muscle strain or pinching feeling. It even mildly hurts to breathe. It was sore enough to keep me awake last night. Occasionally, I'll feel some dull referred pain on my right. It's so deceiving...it makes me feel like I'm having a back issue, but it all started when the constipation did. Can you all share your back pain issues related to IBS? Anyone else have this?

"Hi there, I am hoping somebody can shed light on this. I was told by my doctor that I have IBS. I suffer from anxiety disorder which is all centered around illness fears... my bowel movements are not the problem Amen to that. I usually only go to the bathroom once a day and it is in the morning after breakfast unless i am having a period of IBS, then I need to jump out of bed and GOOOO immediatly. that is usually it for the day.... so my question with IBS is that my problem is a constant ache in my abdomen that can last a week or two at a time ( some days include bloating and gas )? IS this normal with IBS...then it will vanish for weeks or months.... but when i have it, it scares me because i feel like my insides are about to fall out....

"hello everyone,
my name is Anthony and im 36 yrs of age and 161lbs. i was diagnosed with ibs along with having chronic inactive mild gastritis 6 months ago. currently I still have this gastritis and ppis don't help at all so it doesn't seem to be getting better with the mild burning and now I have the cramping going on in my stomach. I've had a upper endoscopy done to confirm the gastritis along with a complete metabolic panel done. My Calprotectin fecal test came back abnormal my level is at 204 when the normal range is 120 or below. I saw the results today and kind of freaked out my doctor hasn't gone back to me cuz the results came today. would the gastritis be causing this high level of 204? anyone else have this happen to them? I've also noticed that I have mild enlarged spleen very mild. and I also have chronic liver disease but all my liver enzymes are fine now and I have lost 117 lb since January of this year and i was really overweight at 278lbs . I am seeing a liver doctor for this. has anyone had a high level of Calprotectin along with their gastritis? i also have hypothyroidism as well.

"Hi, I am having episodic stomach pains, very severe (agonising..dont use the word lightly....been admitted overnight twice but nothing sinister found on blood tests etc.) which follow a very distinct pattern but do not seem to include either being bunged up or diarrhoea. i have been given IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (also was told that as i have had multiple abdominal surgeries, nerve entrapment may well be worsening the condition) and as I am essentially disabled and unable to move without severe pain during an episode was told to ""make domestic arrangements to assist"" (difficult to get up stairs when affected, or sit, or stand up, or anything using stomach muscles no matter how slightly). These episodes started about a year after a gall bladder removal.
I can ""feel"" an episode coming on long in advance..it starts as a stitch like pain in my lower abdomen , anywhere along the lower pelvic area middle or sides. pains can eventually include radiating back pain and pain in the hips. The pain persists gradually increasing over several days or even weeks, eventually culminating in the agony I have described, which tends to start decreasing after 3 or 4 days being essentially bedridden (I actually need help when this is really bad..just to get up and down out of bed or a chair). So far I have had 3 of these episodes this year with no obvious trigger or reason.....I'm not seeing IBS described like this anywhere..does anyone else experience it like this or should i seek another opinion?? thank you for your help.

"Hello!
I am 30 years old woman. I have suffered of comstipation all of my life, since baby. But three years ago, I started to abuse with Cassia, for around 7-8 months. It caused the problem. But in one moment, I decided to stop Cassia at all. And did it. But 18 months after I stopped with any laxatives, I still have this problem and it is not getting better.
After every eating or drinking (only water) my abdomen swell very, very much, as if I have a football gulp in the lowest part ot my abdomen. It happens almost immediately. It occurs even if I chew a gum.
PS: I have tried all of the diets, but no one had there been any effect.
The only thing that slightly relieves is to lie or the best - lift my legs AND abdomen up, so that my body to take the opposite position (legs and back on the wall).
Is this IBS?
And one more question. Is there a medical examination (imaging) which can show if there is a ptosis of the bowel?
Sorry for my mistakes in the English.

"Hi everyone, my name's Maria. I'm writing here as my doctor doesn't seem to care. I've had IBS since the age of 16 and I am absolutely sick of it. I have diarrhea every single day sometimes up to 10 times a day and I've had 16 anal fissures in the space of 5 months. Sometimes my stool contains mucus, occasionally blood and frequently it is neon yellow. I've tried gluten free, dairy free, low fodmap etc. and nothing is working for me. I know this sounds dramatic but I've actually thought about suicide. I would never actually do it I dont think but it is so debilitating that I get to the point where I can't cope and I just want to get away from it all. Its embarrassing and ridiculously inconvenient. I eat, I have to run to the bathroom. And repeat. I am a student nurse and I am terrified this is having an impact on my career. I've had blood tests for crohns amd celiacs disease but apparently my body doesn't show enough inflammation that a typical person with either of these conditions have, therefore it's ""just IBS"". It really annoys me that IBS doesn't get taken seriously. I genuinely pooed myself on my own doorstep on Wednesday. I didn't make it to the toilet in time and was with my boyfriend. Luckily, he is supportive and just laughed it off but how embarrassing is that for me? I just went to my room and cried. I'd be very grateful if any of you have any suggestions for me. Thank you all, a very fed up 21 year old x

"Hi everyone. I'm 30 years old male. For the past couple weeks I've been having floating stools and left upper quadrant pain. The pain has greatly diminished and today its not there much at all but just this morning I had very watery diahrrea with what looked like yellow oil and yellow globs of something. Also there were small patches of foam in the one I didn't take a picture of. Does this seem like mucus or fat to you? If it is fat then I am very concerned about pancreatic cancer because I am a worst scenario person. I have had bouts of what I believe have been ibs in the past and I remember having watery diahreah but I didn't look at it as closely as I do now. The pain I was having made me hyperaware of everything now. My pee is very clear though and no sign of jaundice. Have any of you with ibs had stool that looks like this before? I appreciate any input. Thank you.

"Hello, I'm a 31 year old male who is waiting on the official diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis. One of my many symptoms of UC is red bumps in numerous spots on my body which a few doctors have chalked up to eczema - however these don't get worse in the winter and don't go away with normal eczema medication.
I live in the UK and have had a rough go of it through the NHS. In August I noticed a pain in my left oblique area which I chalked up to a strained muscle after doing a hard kettlebell workout and then golfing 36 holes in a day. I got blood work and a stool sample done and there was nothing alarming (aside from low Folic Acid counts). I was referred to a Gastroenterologist but my appointment isn't until mid February (oh the NHS!).
Over the last 2 weeks I've had really bad pains in my left abdomen but have also had pains in my lower back (left side) as well as my kidney (just below my left ribcage). It almost feels like a pressure buildup that goes away after I pee or pass a stool. My stools & pee look normal and the pain seems to be slowly easing but it's still there.
I'm starting to get a bit worried because I've gone to emergency services. The individual at emergency services literally told me there was nothing he could do and if I was worried enough I should just pay for a private colonoscopy (£1800 or more). I called my GP back and they won't even let me come into the office for a follow up appointment due to COVID health and safety issues. Everything is over a phone and the soonest appointment is 3 weeks from now.
As somebody who is very regimented with what I put into my body, I know this is not from a singular food. 2 things I'm wondering about though are if this could be coming on due to marajuana which I unfortunately smoke too much of (daily user). Also I use a carrying cup for my coffee and noticed a few areas of mould in the bottom of it last Sunday before throwing it away.
Could this simply be a pulled muscle and an adverse reaction to consuming mouldy coffee for a week or 2? An ulcerative colitis flair? At this point I'm just looking for some over the counter remedies get me to my Gastro appointment in February, but I am also making myself a bit paranoid that I have a serious problem and am making it worse by letting it fester for the next 3 months.

"Hello!
I am super worried. I am 28 years old and have always struggled with my weight. I had lost quite a bit through eating vegan only to put it back on when I stopped being vegan about two years ago.
In January I decided to go vegan again after eating a terrible diet (fried foods, pizza, bagels, etc). I was healthy- consuming a diet rich in fruits and veggies and beans and nuts- but then I went on vacation and it threw me off. I was also working overtime for a while which left me with little time and motivation to meal prep and so I slipped to old habits. However, I have been back to eating high fiber fresh produce and plant based proteins and fats for the past month.
Though I can't precisely pinpoint when my symptoms began, I know it was several months ago (February of this year?). I noticed one day my stool was quite wide but flat- almost paper thin. I thought this was odd and asked my mother what that meant. She is a nurse. She replied ""it could mean there is obstruction."" When I proceeded to tell her I was asking about myself and when I started to panic she wrote it off saying that BMs can come in different shapes and consistencies depending on diet. She said I am too young for colon cancer (which is what I jumped to after some quick research) and have no family history of it.
I noticed flat stool from then on after almost every BM. Sometimes it would be long and flat, sometimes small little flat pieces. I also occasionally have long and thin stools. On occasion I would have a normal BM. When I was eating really healthy, high fiber, it would be mostly unformed. The color varies and I think I noticed it's mostly dependent on diet- when I eat more smoothies and higher fiber it's darker brown and looser. I also often notice undigested foods in it. When I eat lower fiber it's more firm and light in color.
Most mornings I have a BM upon waking then typically again after I eat. However, there are days when I will be on the toilet all morning because I have to go again. This doesn't ever happen beyond the AM. Though on these days I can go 5-6 times in the AM alone and then another few times during the day/night. I attributed this to adjusting to high fiber diet as over the past month I have been eating primarily veggies and fruits during the day. However the morning flare ups seem random. I was thinking of tracking my food more precisely and noting when they happen to look for potential patterns.
I do not have blood. I maybe saw light red blood on the toilet paper 2x in the past several months. I also do not think I am bloated.
I do occasionally have a hard time pushing it out and am left feeling like I have an incomplete BM and it causes mild cramps in lower abdomen. However I rarely have pain or cramps otherwise. I've also noticed more flatulence but not to the point where I cannot control it and it causes me public embarrassment, ha.
About a month ago, I had intense sharp pain on my anus to the point that moving and walking felt almost impossible. I made an appt with a GI doctor but they couldn't get me in for 2 months. My primary doctor did not see me but said it was likely hemmerhoids and would go away on its own. It felt like a soft lump and I was in so much pain I had my mother look at it. She told me it was a cyst with certainty. I have gotten cysts in strange places before but because of my other symptoms I panicked for a few days. However after a BM I wiped and it burst- sorry for the image! there was a lot of blood and I did my best to clean it and I put a big hospital bandage over the area (it did not cover my anus. The cyst was located beside it- not coming out of the anus). The pain was immediately gone- so I assume it is not related but worth a mention.
I have no history of colon cancer but after reading online for months and panicking, I am worried that doesn't matter. The only risk factor I have is being overweight, which I have been actively working on losing weight.
Does anyone have any thoughts? I am unable to sleep because I'm so anxious and I still have 3.5 weeks before my GI appointment and another week before I meet with my primary care doctor for a physical where I will tell him my symptoms.
Thank you!

"Dear all,
Any guidance, suggestions, and information is greatly appreciated. My GI has been off for the past few months with relatively inconsistent and loose stools on a regular basis. I completed by labs and bloodwork last week and received all results yesterday. I reside in California, and am in the Scripps medical system. All labs and bloodwork came back normal, except for calprotectin, which was 67 ug/g. According to the lab, the normal range is 50 ug/g or below.
I am an epidemiologist and I suffer from SEVERE health anxiety. My primary care physician has not responded to my calls or emails, which heightens my anxiety even more. I understand that my calpro level is not extremely high, but my anxiety spins out of control.
I would be most grateful for any thoughts or feedback on my calprotectin result. In addition, any advice on dietary or lifestyle modifications would be useful.
Warm regards and thank you in advance,
D

Has anyone else experienced a significant negative change in symptoms during an illness, particularly a non-GI related illness, that have passed once you've gotten better?

"Its been a week since school started and I missed the whole thing.Ive been feeling nausea,a clump in my throat,burping,and sounds from my stomach you'd usually hear when you're hungry but I hear em basically at random but a lot more than what id think is normal.The nausea is the worst of all.
I've gone to the doctor and he sat me down for not even kidding 2 min.He asked what I had and I told him everything and than he asked if I felt pain in my stomach and than I said no and he just told me there's nothing wrong and that its all in my head and basically that I should just get to school and deal with it myself otherwise I'd have to go to a psychiatrist.
I feel like that wasn't even a real visit.Id gone 4 months before back before summer where I missed the entire end of school and then nothing got fixed.I ignored it for the entire summer because i had no reason to care and it got better(most of the time) but than resurfaced as soon as the stress of school started to come to me.
I dont have any mental issues I dont think.I get stressed out or nervous about school but no more than anyone else.This same stress and anxiety about school makes my symptoms go way worse and I tried way back when I first had the symptoms to just go to school since doctors said I didn't have issues but I couldn't get there.I tried day after day and I failed each time,becoming too nauseus to even enter the school gates.
Today now that schools open again this has become sort of like a fear of fear for me and I dont wanna even try getting to school unless I feel perfect because I'm too scared i won't be able to go there again.
Its becoming really mentally taxing because everyone thinks its all in my head and I'm mentally ill or some s**t and I think if this keeps going I might just end up proving them right.

"hi
After years and years of terrible bowel and digestive symptoms I finally got a diagnosis of Sibo. Not one dr ever mentioned Sibo over the years they just said I have bowel motility issues/constipation/IBS but I knew there was more going on than just that. Earlier this year I ended up being seen by someone new who said my symptoms sounded just like sibo and I should be tested.. yes finally! I have constant excessive gas which smells like sulfur. Most of the gas is permanently trapped and makes my life an absolute misery and lying down at night is hell. I find it gets even worse when I have any sugars, carbs, certain veggies, lactose basically a whole host of things. I have been put on a low fodmap diet and given erythromycin to get bowels moving but not antibiotics. The test showed I have quite an overgrowth of bacteria so does anyone know why antibiotics are not being suggested to start with?

"Hello, I am a 24 year old boy.
I have a constant pain more or less strong which is located under the ribs on the right or in the back (but close to the ribs). It is constant 24 hours a day. It has been going on for a week.
I have had this before, last year. The pain lasted for 8 months and the liver, pancreas and stomach tests showed no problem. Except for a small amount of steatosis in the liver which was quickly cured. But nothing justified the pain. She left on her own in March 2021. And she has been coming back for a week for no reason.
It hurts a little less when I am standing or lying down. The pain increases when sitting.
It drives me crazy. Have you ever felt similar things?

"Hello, I am a 25 year old female.
Some background on me. I have a long history with GERD, constipation, etc. I take esomeprazole 40mg daily to keep heartburn at bay... works great. This year has probably been the MOST stressful year of my life. My job is incredibly stressful, I recently moved to a new town by myself, and my mom had quite a year with her own health issues that made me really upset for a good 5 months. So it's been a hard year for me and I suffer from generalized anxiety + OCD as it is. Any way I would love some advice/reassurance about some gastro issues I have been experiencing.
About two months ago I developed this feeling of fullness behind my left rib cage. Came and went and was so mild that I didn't even pay attention to it. Thought it was my spleen but that came back fine. However, over the last month that feeling turned more into ""pain."" I'd actually say more discomfort than pain as is never severe at all. Super mild and comes and goes throughout the day. I have it occasionally on my right side too now. Been having some cramping in my lower abdomen too. The discomfort is all over and changes a lot. Once in a while I'll have a twinge in my mid back. It's weird sometimes it feels like trapped gas, cramps, other times pulling, it's always changing! I have been very gassy lately too. Belching a lot and it feels like there are bubbles in my stomach and large intestine. Sometimes my stomach feels starving even after I have eaten. I have a great appetite through all this. Only time it's affected is when I am anxious over symptoms. I eat everything I haven't tried a specific diet yet to see how it makes me feel. I am also pretty constipated on the regular. My bowel movements take a bit of time to come out and usually are dark brown with mucus. But they are normal size (not thin or soft) My discomfort actually feels like it has gotten better this week but it's still there everyday to some degree. I had an upper endoscopy in Feb. that found mild chronic gastritis but would think the Nexium fixed this? I have been reading the internet a lot and have come across some scary things that this could be. If you have health anxiety you know what I am talking about!! Anyway, anyone else experiencing anything like this? Over these couple months I have had X-Ray, lots of blood work, CT scan, full abdominal ultrasound. Everything has come back normal. I have an appt. with my gastro on Friday to discuss symptoms but thought I'd leave a comment here in the meantime just to not feel so anxious about what is going on. Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks!

"Hello, I'm posting this for my wife. She has a lot of upper abdominal pain/discomfort, especially in the evening. She often says it feels better when she puts pressure on her upper abdomen with her hand. Also, at times she has pain when eating, that makes it difficult to continue eating. She also burps a lot, and she says that it sometimes feels like food is trying to come up when she burps. Her doctor recommended Prilosec, which she has been taking every day. Also, she often drinks warm lemon/honey water in the evening. Both of these remedies seem to help reduce the symptoms to some extent, but not totally. Her doctor had ordered an upper abdominal x-ray several months ago, which showed a lot of constipation. So she has been taking Miralax off and on for that. We are wondering if you all have any idea what could be the root of her upper abdominal pain, and what steps we should pursue next?

"I'm 39. I've actually gone to the Dr for this about 20 times. They've done a colonoscopy, an endoscopy, a sonogram, and blood tests. All came out good except my pancreas was getting close to warning levels on some parts of the blood test. I tried medication to slow down my digestion and clear out bad gut bacteria but neither worked.
Oh, I forgot to mention I was a pretty bad alcoholic for about seven years and I'm pretty sure that's what caused this. I also used to wear overly tight pants during the same time period.
I'm tired of farting 100 times a day and you know what, maybe I might want to be loved for once in my entire life. So I am very serious about doing something. I'm ready to read the damn medical books myself and go to Mexico for surgery.
I haven't had health insurance for years and I'm starting a new job which offers it but I'm thinking about not getting it because it didn't help before. Maybe I will use telehealth?
No combination of diet and fiber pills has ever worked. Maybe I have something like dumping syndrome where food moves too quickly through my stomach and small intestine. idk.
Would you please offer some advice about how I can come up with a game plan. No sense in suggesting I ""talk to my Dr."" That's why I'm here.

At first my dr didn't want to do a colonoscopy, then waited until my insurance lapsed and then wanted to do one, but I had to decline because I can't afford to pay out of pocket for the very expensive procedure. Just wondering if anyone else had something similar and if I should be concerned about it. No blood in stool (none visible anyway), occasional gas/bloating, etc.

"Basically my IBS only started a few months ago. And it started with my appetite disappearing completely and a LOT of mucus, both when passing the stool and on its own. Then the diarrhea, cramps, bad wind and everything else started. 4-ish months later my flare-ups come and go, but on a normal day I still go to the toilet about 4 times a day. I know that this is a lot better than most people and I’m lucky as my Mebeverine controls the cramps quite well most of the time. But the thing is, I still don’t have a proper appetite. Is this normally a symptom of IBS? I cant really find any answers anywhere. My doctor thinks it might be a psychological thing (?) where I associate large amounts of food with pain but I honestly do not agree.
I’m eating like once a day, and going to the toilet 4 times, how does that even work!? Until yesterday I went nearly 48 hours without eating and I didn’t even realise. I know that it sounds stupid, but literally no food appeals to me, I go to the shop, walk around and leave because there’s nothing I want to eat. I try to eat fruit and veg and yogurt when I can but the only thing I have actually WANTED to eat in weeks is crisps and tuna. So I was just wondering if anyone else has had the same strange loss in appetite. Or if anyone has any help they could offer?
My doctor said she might send me to a dietician, but I feel like my friends and family almost think I’m exaggerating things and I’m a bit worried if I go to a dietician then they’ll just think I am playing on things. So I want to try other things before I go back to the doctors.
Thanks for reading at least !

"Hi there. I have had upper right abdo pain for a few weeks and had bowel problems for years. The last few days I have had a disgusting taste in my mouth and my husband said my breath is really bad. I brush my teeth and mouthwash constantly and have recently been to the dentist and had no problems with my teeth. Can anyone advise if these symptoms could be connected or has anyone else experienced similar symptoms? Thanks.

"Hi all
Went to see a specialist senior GI doctor yesterday with my ongoing bowel issues and he said it sounds like I have post infectious IBS and I might have picked up an infection and my bowels are still in a spiral.
Have any of you been diagnosed with this? We are still doing a colonoscopy on Oct 5th but he is adamant he will not find anything.
I really cant believe that he is so positive that he will not find a cancerous tumor though (this is my fear), this has been going on for about 8 weeks now, I have had a few normal BM's from then to now but most of the time the BM is narrow, small & the qty is quite small too however I have also lost 13lbs in 8 weeks due to reducing my calorie intake drastically only because I am so anxious..
One thing to remember my partner started with the same issues 8 weeks ago and we both went to the GP whom requested stool samples which we both did and it was normal, the GP requested Full blood test panels from me (as I saw the dr again after our initial visit) and they were normal (surely if there was infection my white blood cells would have been fighting something??). My partner seems to have gone back to normal now but every other day or maybe more he will be plagued by explosive diarrhea with all colors of the rainbow (sometimes) other times he would need to go about 4/5 times a day where me I just have small narrow stools every morning, they are soft & some mornings it could look like cow poop (all mushy).
So anyone that has been diagnosed with this Post infectious malarkey if you can give me some insight.. - sorry for the long post...

Ive been diagnosed with IBS since April.
Now I get an urge and tummy ache before I need to rush to the toilet in the morning.
Ive been getting a feeling of discomfort under my ribs, off and on recently and wondered if this can be caused by IBS?  It feels like a band at the bottom of my ribcage and it definitely is under both ribs.

Whenever I try to take probiotics, prebiotics, or probiotic type foods even in small amounts, I get pains around my small intestine/ colon area in the midsection.

"Hello, for the second time now I have had a hard white lump roughly the size of an egg in my stool. It's dry and powdery on the inside. I took a picture of it (I am sorry if it's gross).
I was at the hospital yesterday and they checked my blood and did an ultrasound of my abdomen. Everything seems to be normal (liver, gallbladder, pancreas).
Has anybody ever had something like this or similar? I didn't change my diet. But the last few days my stool was also yellow, no diarrhea. Just the colour of mustard. But the colour is now almost back to normal. I would be glad for any and every advice. Thank you very much.

"Hello,
I am a 24 year old male in desperate need of help. Have been suffering from chronic and severe halitosis for past 12 months now. 
All started mildly back in November 2015 and was not too bad and would be gone if brushed teeth, however 4 month later and up to now it has become extremely bad and chronic. 
During this the 4 month had a extremely bad junk food and spicy food diet, having these kind of meals at least 7-8 times a week and always overeating and eating late night and going to bed straight away. 
My main symptoms are horrendous mucus that has always been there from the beginning, and i believe this is is responsible for 90% of the halitosis. The smell is coming through my nose and even when mouth is closed can be smell man feet away.
Other symptoms include chronic rumbling by lower esophagus area when eating and throughout day. Whenever there is rumbling this is followed instantly by a fizzing/popping sound at back of my throat. This get much worse when lying down as well as the mucus in throat. The smell and mucus also gets worse on an empty stomach and rumbling aswell. Severe mucucs production in throat and post nassal drip aswell as diffculties swallowing. Also chronic burping and flatulence after meals for 2 hours, with horrible smelling burps. 
The ENt has also stated my sinuses are very infalmmed due to the LPR and reason for nasal congestion.
I have also been suffering from what seems to esophageal spasms and the pain extends to neck and shoulders. There is also pain in both shoulders after i eat any foods. I have tried EVERYTHING. However nothing has helped me. I am due for a GI appointment tomorrow. 
Please can someone provide any help and let me know if any surgery has helped or what can be done to cure the issue. 
I have had to quit my job, become a total recluse and have suffered from bad depression for past 6 months. Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks

"So I have been concerned about my bowel movements from quite a while. I have soft stool 3 days a week it looks brown some times 2 different shades at the same time with a bad odour(I don't know if this smell is normal). Also I feel very slight pressure on the right side of my abdomen just below right rib. All my blood tests came back normal and stool d/r and occult blood also came back normal plus my upper abdomen ultrasound was also normal. I'm very concerned about colon cancer (which is unlikely as I'm only 18 yrs old) and I'm also an anxiety patient. I also had E.histolytica shown up about 3 months back in a stool test if it helps..

"long story short, ive been suffering with health anxiety and stress for over the past 2+ years. ive been having digestive issues and discomfort for this amount of time and this is where it has stemmed from. Ive had ribcage discomfort, bloating, no appetite, pulling sensation in lower abdomen that feels like its going to tear when i sneeze, backache, mucus in stool, breathing issues, chest tightness, headaches. ive had a million tests done. blood work, CRP blood work, pelvic and abdominal ct scan, abdominal ultrasound, stool sample, mammogram, hip and pelvic x ray, ECG, Holter monitor fitted for 24 hours. Im booked in for another ultrasound to check my abdomen wall next month to see if they can figure out this pulling sensation, my gyno thinks maybe endo or scar tissue from a c section almost 6 years ago. i just dont know what to do anymore. Then last night to make things worse i had a dream i had cancer and now im pannicking that maybe its a sign to keep fighting for answers incase they missed something. or is that just my health anxiety making me think that way. Is there anyone who suffers like this at all? please help

"Hello, I have struggled with chronic IBS-C for 5 -10 years. My primary symptom is that I simply cannot take / handle any type of Supplement / Medication. Everything ranging from Aloe, DGL, Natural Vitamins, Coconut oil, etc etc etc. Last week my newest doctor had me try a very low dose digestive enzyme. After several days I began to experience the common stomach burning / cramping / bloating / anxiety / headaches / weakness / fatigue / insomnia. For my stomach she had me try pepto bismol --- just made things worse.
1) Ulcer -
The only thing my colonscopy / endoscopies have turned up is an ulcer. The diet that works best for me is a 'non-abrasive' diet -- fiber, whole wheat, beans, rice, lean meats. Raw vegetables, high fat meats, stuff like that hurt my stomach (as do the normal irritants -- coffee, caffeine, high sugar, etc which I avoid).
So my question is -- could my inability to take Supplements & Medications simply be due to an Ulcer?
2) Anxiety -
I always go back and forth with my IBS and anxiety. Do the problematic foods, supplements & medications trigger anxiety which causes my IBS, or is it the other way around? Chicken & Egg type deal.
Could I be unable to take Supplements & Medications b/c these simply trigger anxiety?
For example - my doctor had me try vitamin b pills last month - they of course caused my normal symptoms - stomach & anxiety. So, I tried a Vitamin B topical cream -- this did not seem to irritate my stomach, but increased my other symptoms -- anxiety, headaches, weakness (same goes for IV's & Sublinguals).
- Would a Topical Creams reach the stomach? If not, why would this increase my anxiety and other non-stomach symptoms if the primary issue is IBS?
================
I am on about my 25th-30th doctor, I have read up on IBS for years and simply still at a loss as to why I cannot take any Supplement / Medication whatsoever and am even sensitive to topical creams. My family is concerned that if I do not take anything I am never going to get better. And other concerns such as if I had surgery or was in an accident, I would be at serious risk since I cannot handle any medication.
I really appreciate any feedback you can provide - thank you.

"Hi folks,
First time posting and came here after feeling like I've run out of places to look for help. Which is depressing beyond belief as I don't want to consider this could be never-ending.
It's effecting my ability to work to my best ability and my quality of life.
In a nutshell I feel incredibly nauseous every single day - from waking up (typically it's worse first thing) where I feel like I need to vomit (but never actually do) until the end of the day - where it tends to ease off slightly but the feeling is still there.
Some days it includes severe stomach cramps that I can only compare to food poisoning, where I can't get out of bed.
I'm 33 years old, male, and relatively fit and active (when I can)
Not really overweight - possibly a stone over what I feel is my peak (I'm 11.5) But this weight gain feels a bit inevitable when I physically don't feel up to exercising anymore.
I've cut out drinking - didn't help.
I've tried a gluten free diet - didn't help.
And I've done dietary and intolerance tests - nothing came up.
Visited my GP on 6 instances and he is at a loss - initially though it was stomach acid / reflux and have tried omeprazole and now pantoprazole which both seemed to reduce the sickness to a more 'manageable' level initially. I could just about get myself into the gym or run most days (although nowhere near able to put the same effort in as the feeling of sickness still there)
Recently it has gotten worse and worse.
I have been into hospital for an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy where they could find nothing of concern / nothing to explain it.
Now the GP has all but said he's at a loss and perhaps the best thing I can do is stay on omeprazole / pantoprazole indefinitely - but it's not really working now and longterm use is not even recommended.
Sorry for waffling. Bit of a hail mary - I was just hoping maybe someone out there has encountered something similar.
Thanks for listening
Ben

"So it's been like 5 months already, I am having minor headache and I am suffering from excessive flatulence. I consulted a neurologist 3 months ago and told my problems about the headache thing he said it's a tension type headache and he told me to eat my meal at proper time and gave me some anti depressant medicines. Since I started to eat those medicines, my head pain was improved a lot but it's not completely recovered yet. Apart from that I am having this problem of constant urge to go to the toilet every morning as soon as I wake up and I pass a lot of wind throughout the day even if I do stool, while only average amount of stool gets passed when I do stool. My stomach is also bit bloated while My Stool is also like sometimes it is bit loose sometimes it is normal, sometimes it is hard but it's not watery stool till now. I do stool sometimes just once in the morning in fact and sometimes I do it like two or three times a day not more than that. I was worried so I did stool test too, it showed completely normal stool but some undigested food particles were present. Apart from that I also have stomach cramps sometimes, it feels like my stomach is burning especially when I eat my meal sometimes during night time or sometimes in the day and the pain does not happen for a long time, it happens for short period of time and it's gone like a miracle. I even consulted a gastroenterologist and told my problems he said it's the starting phase of IBS and he told me everything is normal you don't need to perform any colonoscopy or any other exams, he gave me some medicines though which didn't work well. My stomach also makes sound sometimes and especially when I feel like my stomach is paining it makes noise and boom the pain is gone. I have never vomited till now since the time 5 months before I had this problem or feel like I am fainting neither I became sick. My weight is also not decreased and it's increasing instead since nowadays i have started to eat a lot. Could someone help me please??? Would be grateful if someone sorted out my problem.

"I am a 25 y/o male, just last year I started feeling tenesmus. Consulted a GP to find out it might be caused by internal hemorrhoid. Took some Daflon and suppositories for weeks and it went well. By March 2021, I started to have tenesmus again, this time around I went to get a colonoscopy, to discover I have mild proctitis and hemorrhoid are getting bigger. Once again, the doctor prescribed me Daflon and suppositories. On July 2021, the tenesmus is back at it again! I went to see a surgeon to find out I had a grade 2 hemorrhoid, so I had stapled hemorrhoidectomy just a month ago. Unfortunately till today I still have this tenesmus, back and forth I had went back to see the doctor and even directed to a urologist cause my prostate was swelling and overly-sensitive. At one point I took levofloxacin, it was starting to get better, down to almost 95% of feeling gone. But just in one afternoon after a BM, tenesmus came back stronger than ever, it killed my sleep few days in a row and I even tried seeing other colorectal surgeon but they can't tell what is causing this problem exactly. Is anyone else experiencing the same problem with me, I am only 25 I don't want to live like this for the rest of my life.. Any good advice or suggestion would be appreciated..
P/S: these doctors somehow never placed ulcerative colitis as one of the possible cause, so I am thinking if I should just get mesalazine myself to see if it would get better overtime or not. Also I am suspecting it could be the stapled line that is still in my rectum that hasn't fall off yet, amplifying the tenesmus.

"My elderly mother has been experiencing severe upper abdominal pain for about a year. She describes the pain as pressure right under her ribs in the area near her stomach and its a pulling sensation. The pain usually results in her being restricted to lying down in bed and it occurs about every other day. She states that it is correlated with eating and primarily starts at night. My mother has changed her diet to a low fat diet but this does not seem to help.
The first doctor she went to found that she had gall stones and they removed her gall bladder last year. Unfortunately, the pain has worsened. She recently had bloodwork and a CT performed which came back normal and recently endoscopy and ultrasound were performed and it found no abnormalities. My mom has become increasingly pessimistic as all the lab results are coming back normal. In addition, the doctors seem to imply that the issue is due to her weight. My mother has a very high pain tolerance and I feel that this cannot be due to her weight. While she is slightly overweight, I do not feel her weight could be the cause of the pain she is describing.
My mother does have a history of adhesions as she has had several abdominal surgeries in the past and actually has had to do exploratory surgery to remove adhesions. Based on what I have read, it appears adhesions cannot be diagnosed with CT/ultrasound. We have discussed other causes, such as IBD, but we are still not certain what is causing her pain. Any assistance or advice would be appreciated.
Thank you

"Hello all, Ibs sufferer for well over 10 years, used to flare ups lasting a few days but ive now been struggling with easily passed stools for 12 days, lots of urgency, wind and whilst this has been mainly in the mornings has continued throughout the day. ive tried different foods to bulk my stools up, ive tried a long course of probiotics that have helped in the past. i consulted my doctor who said its perfectly normal for flare ups to last weeks even months at time.
i dont want to take imodium as that only makes the situation worse a day or two down the line. i work early mornings so this is a real problem for me.

"Hi everyone I am a 28 year old female, I am diagnosed with IBS. With this is have a mix of diarrhoea and constipation, I get wind, daily stomach cramps, nausea and low back pain. I deal with anxiety, I was housebound for 8 years and have started going out over the last 3, my anxiety does make my daily ibs worse.
However every 8 months or so I would have very severe episodes (I do not know whether this is due to IBS or something else so would like to hear if this happens to anyone else) where I have really bad cramps and urgency to go to the toilet, when I get to the loo I have very bad diarrhoea that won't stop, I start sweating profusely and feel very faint to the point I am too weak to sit on the toilet, I end up falling off the toilet onto the floor and have to take all my clothes off. I find it hard to get back onto the toilet even though I am still having bad diarrhoea, as I am so weak and faint, I have passed out before from this too.
As I said before this would only happen every so often, I'd say 8 months or so, however on the 1st jan this happened again and I had to shout to my boyfriend to help me (which was very embarrassing lying on the floor naked having terrible diarrhoea and feeling boiling and faint) this happened again on the 11th jan which has sent me into a complete anxious state. Usually this wouldn't happen so close together, I don't even know if this is a severe case of IBS or something else entirely. I am scared to go out, I have started uni and I am terrified to go in in case this happens as it's not just urgent diarrhoea it's the fact I am having to take my clothes off as I start sweating and passing out on the floor, I can't do this outside my home, this is really horrible for me when I'm a recovering agoraphobic. I wasn't overly anxious on these days so I really don't feel it is linked to that.
I have been eating very healthily since the episode on Jan 1st, mainly salmon and white rice... so am not sure if it's linked to diet as it used to only happen infrequently... I am a scared to eat now though as it doesn't seem to matter what I eat to have these episodes.
I'd like to hear if anyone else has this happen to them with IBS or if they know it's something else causing it.
My mum has severe ulcerative colitis so I worry about developing this too. I have had celiac tests before when I was diagnosed with IBS.
Any help would be appreciated, I am of course going to talk to my dr too but wanted to see if this is something any of you deal with.

"Hello everyone i suffer health anxiety and have already been told by doctor it sounds as though i have anxiety induced ibs but i keep convincing myself i have something more sinister bowel cancer.
Ive always been one to suffer anxiety on and off and every time my anxiety is high my stool becomes more soft, easier to pass and i go more frequent.
but since march it got to the point i was having mushy stool, soft with almost every bowel movement and i also noticed mucus. i then started taking vitamin b12 and noticed a slight difference it wasnt as soft but was more formed. I noticed on a few occasions i had 2 different consistency in one stool for example one side was soft, one looked normal type 3 and 2 different shades of brown.
about 2- 3 occasions ive had stomach pain followed by watery stool both times i had ate fried foods, alcohol and the stomach pain was relieved by going. apart from that i very rarely get stomach pain and dont suffer any bloating at all which is worrying me even more as i seen a post saying bowel cancer doesnt really cause stomach pain

I am 24, and for the past few years I've been dealing with loose, mushy stools a couple times per day, along with lots of gas and being bloated. I've been to multiple doctors and had various tests, including two gastroscopies, one colonoscopy, blood tests, stool tests, lactulose hydrogen test... etc.
I eat quite healthy. Veggies, some rice, some noodles, fish & light meat (chicken, turkey), sometimes a sandwich. Coeliacs & gluten intolerance have been technically ruled out. I don't consume dairy.
But no matter what I eat, I am always gassy and almost always have that loose stools.
I've taken probiotics, motility supporters (trimebutine), I've tried xifaxan and metronidazole, fibre, pyrantelum (in case if it were parasites), but none of those worked. I took an expensive blood test to check for food intolerances, and I only seem to not tolerate tapioca which I do not eat anyways. NOTHING helps. Seriously I don't know what to do anymore, I am 24 and barely leave the house. I have no social life and I don't work and I need to get a job soon. I can't imagine working in a 9-5 office job with my issues. Especially that when I need to poop, I get extremely gassy, farting every 30 seconds, until I empty my bowels (and sometimes I struggle with feeling as if I didn't empty them fully, too).

"Hi,
I've been the doctors numerous times and they have told me it sounds like IBS, but I am not convinced. I have the following symptoms:
Nausea
Feel like ive done 1000 situps, stomach feels tight and uncomfortable
Aching under my left armpit, left lower back and left side of my ribs (bottom)
Minor headache
These symptoms come and go and I have the nausea even if I haven't ate such as when I wake up.
On Sunday morning (early hours ~ roughly 5-6am) I had pins and needles all down my left arm and left leg. I managed to get some sleep for about an hour, but when I woke I still had it. I then managed to sleep again for about 5hrs and no longer had the pins and needles.
My stools are not always diarrhea like and can be solid. I am also never really constipated.
Does anyone have any idea what is going on?

"Hi, this is my first time posting on this forum and tbh I'm not 100% if I even have IBS. I was hoping for some advice from people that do suffer, to ask if the symptoms I sometimes experience are infact IBS related.
These symptoms have been a part of my life for the last 20 or so years but not so frequent that I was particularly worried and mostly put it down to just something bad I'd eaten at the time but now as time has gone on and I have had repeated episodes which are all very similar, I begin to wonder if infact I have either IBS or something similar.
It always seems to follow the same pattern which is: sudden need to empty my bowels, like need to get to a toilet within 2 minutes. Once I've made it to the toilet I am generally completely soaked in sweat, have the worse stomach cramps and then a sudden onset of, basically, diarrhoea. This usually lasts anywhere from 10 - 40 mins and during this time I cannot leave the toilet lol. After its ""done"" and I feel I can leave the toilet I am completely exhausted and almost grey in colour. I usually then just go straight to sleep and wake up feeling mostly OK.
This maybe happened once or twice a year, then not at all for a good 4 or 5 years but over the last couple years it's been happening more frequently, and more aggressively?
Just looking for some advice really as to whether or not these symptoms are something that IBS sufferers experience? Am currently waiting on a GP appointment but at the moment it's a looking like a long wait so any advice before would be greatly appreciated!

"Hi
2 months ago I felt a pain in my left lower ribs (like a stitch from running) but i was just sitting on the sofa. The pain persisted and moved to my upper abodemn so i made a GP appointment. Kidney infection was rules out and my doctor did some blood tests to make sure it wasn't a clot. She concluded it was probably muscular and perscribed me naproxen.
I was still getting the pain a month later and didn't want to waste NHS time so I used the virtual GP service and they suggested because i bloat after eating it could be IBS, they've since referred me to a gastro specialist and the appointment is in September. My concern is that I dont notice much difference between the pain when i eat so im not sure it's related to IBS?
The pain is continuing and moves between my lower ribs and space between the belly button, sometimes my back too. It feels like someone is hitting me in the side with a baseball bat but the pain comes and goes throughout the day!
I was having heart palptations recently and they did a bunch of tests on my iron, blood pressure and sugar and everything was fine. I don't want to annoy my GP by going back with this pain if it can wait til I see the gastro-specialist next month. Does anyone know if I can hold off til next month?

"Hi,
I've had stomach problems for around two years now with IBS related symptoms. I've had ultrasounds, MRI's and numerous medications including mebeverine, amitriptyline, buscapan etc. I've done low fodmap diets, cut out gluten and also dairy. I drink peppermint tea and have done a food intolerance test.
Nothing seems to have worked and my symptoms come in waves. I can have a few good weeks followed by a few weeks of having constant stomach aches and loose bowels.
I can put up with stomach aches to a degree but over the last two years, maybe every few months I get these really severe stomach pains which come with nausea and the feeling of passing out to the point I have to throw cold water all over myself as I have no idea how to stop the pain or stop myself from collapsing.
My latest episode was on Monday and it was that bad my wife called an ambulance. To my horror it was a six hour wait so made it up to hospital myself but after waiting for 4 hours, the pain had subsided and they wouldn't do anything.
It's massively affecting my life as have two young boys and the anxiety is really getting to me.
Is there anyone else in my position?

"Hello, I have been suffering from a bitter taste in my mouth that lasts a week or so and then goes away for a few days, but almost always comes back. This has been going on for about a year or more.
I've checked with a few doctors and their 3 answers are:
Acid reflux
Some medication/supplement is causing it
Yeast infection on the tongue
I do have acid reflux as well as IBS, but the bitter taste remains even though I take a PPI daily. I dont take any other medication/supplement and my tongue isn't very white to suggest infection (it has been white in the past and I did take the antifungal cream which did help with the bitter taste for a small period of time).
I also get nausea - not the I need to immediately throw up type, but the queasy type you get when you take a medication on an empty stomach. The interesting thing is that the bitter taste also tastes like the taste of panadol or other medications when you leave them in your mouth for too long, but I have not taken any other medication other than PPI in several weeks, so that cant explain it. It also tastes like bile which I have thrown up in the past as I have Gilbert's syndrome,
Does anyone else have this issue? At some point I had convinced myself that its somehow has something to do with the increased amount of hand sanitizer that I have been putting on my hands that is somehow making its way to my mouth.

"Hello, I was told I have diverticulosis after a colonoscopy a few years ago, with a suggestion of irritable bowel.
Like everyone today, I'm under a lot of stress, but these symptoms are new.
I get an awful lot of wind when I go to bed every night, and wake up every day absolutely bursting to pass it, my stomach is so painful. Usually there's also a bowel movement, but these are getting much smaller in diameter, though around the same amount.
I have no other symptoms like blood or weight loss, but I would love to be able to stop the wind.

"hello
looking for some advice really iv had chronic abdominal pain on and off for about three years now. iv been to see the GP countless times and after a few tests they said it was most likely IBS and suggested i take Buscopan. for the most part this helped but in resent months the pain has become much worse with sharp stabbing pains. they had changed the medication to mabevarine but to no avail.
A couple of years ago i had an colonoscopy and nothing was found iv been back to the doctor and they say its just ibs and basically deal with it. im lost for what to do now im in agony. also i have kids and they love to climb apon daddy but any sort of pressing on my abdomen causes immense pain.
im moving house in a few mouths and im worried an how this will affect my stomach as im doing the moving single handed.
what do you think i should do? i cant get referred back to gastrointestinal because as far as my doctor is concerned its ibs.
and advise would much appreciated

"Hi everyone. I hope you're all keeping well. I have been having a lot of stomach issues for the past 10 years and I am really coming to the end of my tether with it all. I will explain everything below. If anyone has some advice or is currently going through something similar, I would love to hear from you.
Okay, where to start. Since secondary school, I have been having nausea most days. Now, I call it nausea because that's the best way I can explain it. My symptoms are hard to explain and I always get looked at like an alien when I try to explain it. It's like gas escaping from my stomach without me burping. It is really uncomfortable and gets worse throughout the day. When it was at it's peak, i was working in crawley (about an hours drive from where I live) and when driving home, I would have to keep pulling over to be sick out of the car (gross. Sorry). If it gets really bad I will have stomach pains and sometimes even dizziness
My doctors for a long time insisted that it was indigestion. So I have been on omeprazole, lansoprazole and Ranitidine. Recently, I have been taken off those medications as I stopped taking them for a while and didn't feel any different.
I used to be on anti-depressants which I am completely off now (something that I am quite proud of doing). I was told that increasing my dosage may help but I have tried this and it didn't work.
About a year ago, I had a endoscopy done and they found a hiatus hernia. I was told that they don't do surgery for this anymore because in most cases medication deals with all the symptoms.
I am so tired of feeling like this everyday and it really is effecting my mood. Every time I go out, I know that I will end up feeling ill. I can no longer work a full time job which has effected my income. I am about to turn 25 and I don't have the ability to save up money to move out of my parents house. It's effecting every aspect on my life and the doctors dont seem to care at all. Below is a list of things that I have tried for at least 3 weeks.
lansoprazole
omeprazole
Ranitidine
citalopram
Peppermint oil capsules
digestive enzymes
probiotic
prebiotic
ginger tablets
charcoal tablets
I am currently on a referral list to see a stomach specialist but because of covid it has been delayed. I can't see me getting to see a doctor in the near future. The frustrating part is that if they referred me a couple of years ago when I first started asking to be referred, I would most likely would have missed this delay in hospital appointments.

"Good afternoon, I am a 45 year old male who has had symptoms of lower abdominal/tummy pain, feeling really gassy, bloating and nausea for about 6 weeks, my bowel movements are slightly changeable but no constipation or diarrhoea and no blood in stools. I first visited my doctor about a month ago and after examination I was diagnosed with diverticulitis and given a 7 day course of antibiotics. 2 weeks later my symptoms had not improved and my GP sent me to the local hospital for blood tests which all came back as normal (presumably with no sign of diverticulitis).
This week I went to see my GP as a follow up to my hospital visit, he says I don't have any of the symptoms that would flag up a major health issue such as blood in stools, weight loss and loss of appetite but is still unable to give a diagnosis. As a precaution I have been asked to do a Fit test (poo) and have an colonoscopy arranged for me, I have also been prescribed mebeverine to take 20 minutes before meals.
Is it possible that my symptoms point to a diagnosis of IBS?

It's been 6 months after I identified that there is something abnormal in my digestion when I had an abdominalcramp and diarrhea in september 2020 .
It was a sharp pain and it became mild after hours and it completely went after 1 day.
Then it came after one or two weeks.
Then I started to browse about the symptoms and I found out that it might be irritable bowel syndrome.
And I took decision that I would consult a doctor after my exams are over.
From One week I am noticing that there is red spots in my stool.
I am panicking now.
I don't know what it is.
Next weeks are my Final exams and I don't know what to do.
I browsed about the symptoms and google shows about coloncancer.
But I don't have weight loss,Fatigue,and Vomiting.
I actually gained weight.

Is it Ibs with piles?

"I have been suffering from Stomach issues since June this year. Tightness or pain in the middle upper abdominal (just below the rib cage). Particularly when the stomach is empty or some time after eating food.
Since June the GP put him on omeprazole 20mg daily. Symptoms did not improve much so had endoscopy and biopsy in October
During the endoscopy everything appeared normal - no ulcer or gastritis but the biopsy now releaved H pylori bacteria positive.
They put me on 2 heavy antibiotics and Pantoprazole 40mg twice a day course for 7 days which was completed on 29 October.
After completing the course I was on omeprazole 20mg for 2 weeks then left ok so went to 10mg for the next 4 weeks with the aim to stop completely for 2 weeks and then test again to see if h pylori has cleared.
Its been nearly 6 weeks after completion of the eradication course and I am still suffering from acidity symptoms ( particularly when stomach is empty). the symptoms have been so intense that I am unable to stop completely. In fact I am thinking of going back to 20mg for a few days.
the problem with 20mg is it causes constipation but 10mg doesn't
Getting off PPI is a real challenge a
has anyone successfully eradicated h pylori with the triple therapy treatment and when did you feel normal post treatment?

"Hey first post on any kind of website like this but thought i'd give it ago as everyone i know is pretty fed up of me talking about my problems! So how it started, around 6 months ago when i was 19 (now 20) i was just my usual healthy self until a got violently sick one day, thought nothing much of it until i started getting pain downstairs which went on for a month or two, now here is where the real problems started.
I started developing stomach and back pain pretty severe with a temperature etc, doctors thought it may be gastroenteritis gave me meds didnt help, then they treated me for a UTI and gave me meds, settled down, i had lost my appetite but i managed to gain it back, along with the stomach problems i started to get dry, irritated eyes, now i have been told only recently i have dry eyes and blepharitis, and around 2 months ago i started to get alot of burning back, shoulder, neck pain, muscle ache, fatigue, sore glands, lymph nodes, headaches, slight tremors, dizzyness you name it, the dry eyes are still there pretty bad but the others have eased slightly.
I was a avid footballer and havent been able to play in 6 months. I went for an endoscopy 3 weeks ago and i have been diagnosed with duodentis and gastritis, not caused by H Pylori, still waiting on my biopsies back they took but it's not really looking good for me. They have tested my blood for so much, like lupus, thyroid problems, deficiencies and can't find anything, they call me the medical mystery. I can't eat well at all the last few weeks, anything spicy, greasy, or acidic drinks burn my stomach, i've lost around 10lbs in the last 6 months and i'm only 9st 4lbs which is pretty skinny. Personally I am concerned about an autoimmune disease, hoping for celiac but i fear it could be worse.

"Hey everyone I'm new here and in need of some advice/opinions.
About two weeks ago i had a constipated bowel movement. That night started the pain in the anus/rectal area. Sometimes it feels like something is stuck in me or like there's stool in me that needs to come out. I haven't had any bleeding with bowel movements. My lower stomach also feels really bloated and has a feeling of being backed up or hurt.
My stool has been pretty thin lately too and almost has defined edges on it. My gi seems to think i was just constipated and experiencing ibs symptoms. I feel like i still have to go to the bathroom even after going a few times and producing stool.
The anal pain, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and thin stools has me so worried about colon cancer.

"Hey, everyone! Between doctor visits, testing, and lots of rummaging through forums, I've decided to throw my story here for both reassurance to others and maybe get a few more answers/advice for myself!
This started after a trip to my girlfriend's mother in PA ( I'm originally from FL ), and on our final night there, I was smoking a joint whilst eating and perhaps took a hit too harsh that lead to coughing + throwing up. I was fine, it happens to some people, but it was when I saw red at the end of my puking that scared me. I make it home the next day, feeling nausea and mental off, try to relax at home whilst waiting for a friend, and the moment I walk outside I found myself choking on spit which caused a violent gag and a pain in my lower stomach that felt like it was stabbed. I was on my knees for about two minutes before it went away and I was feeling good enough to talk, and for the next eight days I had a horribly small appetite with frequent mucus in my stool. I stopped smoking during these days and finally got to a doctor, who told me the red was possible bile or food from earlier that day since I had eaten something with red sauce. My loss of appetite was chalked up to my sudden halt of smoking and it was written down that I also had IBS symptoms.
Afterwards, as months went by, symptoms went and came like crazy; from feeling nausea, to very mild stomach pain, to random bowl movements. It was eating my emotional and mental health to death because I couldn't figure out what was going on nor was I told any specific answers to my problem. I eventually was told to try and follow a FODMAP diet + get some basic exercise in ( walking/biking for 30 min to an hour daily ), which did help in many ways, though a small handful of my symptoms linger. I used to just go with a wait and see method for a good bout of my pain, but with IBS, I ended up with health anxiety as I read about cancer and all types of monsters.
Luckily, none of those worse case scenarios seem to be the case, though I've yet to get the camera or any testing as any pain/symptoms only ever reach mild ( my biggest battle was the mental health one ).
My stool was all over the place. There would be times it was just mucus, maybe mucus with two extremely small pieces of stool, just small stool, diarrhea, hard constipated stool, and the occasional perfect sausage shape, smooth stool ( which was always a weird sigh of relief ). I've so far learned that my triggers are anything fried with oil ( air fried food seems to be a blessing in disguise ), lettuce ( salads gave me diarrhea full of undigested lettuce which terrified me at first ), pork, and mayonnaise.
I have an appointment set up with a GI to discuss my symptoms further and I'm highly considering getting tests done to rule out cancer(s) despite being 22. As of recently, my symptoms are still there, but nothing as bad as it was before, though going from decently normal to having mucus, random pains, and slight nausea just from eating one wrong food still punches at my mental health.
Has anybody had similar experiences or any advice? As I've said before, me and my primary doctor are almost certain it's IBS and I've gone back to smoking marijuana two months ago ( it help with my anxiety + symptoms don't seem to be bothered by doing so ).

"I'm 36 and Ive had stomach problems for the past few years, it all started after I took some antibiotics in 2019. I mainly have a swelling on the right side of my stomach which I believe is the intestine, sometimes the swelling is more sometimes less but its always there, when pressed / massaged often ends up in passing wind.
I have been to the doctors a few times about it and had two ultrasounds with no concerns, however it is ongoing and seems to get no better and is especially worse in the morning with alot of stomach churning and feeling very fatigued and a bit nausea, it takes me a while to shake it off in the morning.
I stopped drinking milk with breakfast and switched to kefir as a test around 6 months ago, nothing has changed apart from I’m having much less diarrhoea than I was previously so I stuck to that. I have also tried probio7 tablets for a few months previous to that but it seemed they had no effect at all, I even ended up trying the ultra version of it. I'm not sure what else to do, any suggestions welcome.

"I was diagnosed with IBS and started the Fodmap elimination back in 2019 with an NHS dietitian. It turned out all the fodmap groups were triggers.
As a result, I've been on a very restricted diet (as I am also vegetarian), but it's totally worth it not to get the irritation of IBS.
However, since around Feb, many (but not all) of my symptoms have come back even though I am following the same diet that worked (I've not made any changes).
Because of my bowel symptoms, I don’t sleep well, and I've also noticed that lack of sleep is a trigger, so I don’t know if that's trapped me in a vicious circle!
Until March, I was being supervised by an NHS dietician. But she discharged me saying that she’s reached the end of what she can do and I should stick with the diet and ride out any irritations.
I really am stuck. I now am pooping nearly after every meal (although it comes easily). I also feel tired all the time. I take rice protein powder, which helps a bit with tiredness, but my general energy isn’t that great. I’m worried that being stuck on a restrictive might be harmful to my long term health. However, when ever I try anything new (even foods that are labelled as “yellow” in the Monash Fodmap app or “green” in smaller quantities), I just get a bad reaction.
I also struggle with hunger. At least 6 times a month I wake up night feeling hungry. And during the day, I feel both hungry and full at the same time at meal times, which is not a great feeling.
I don’t know what to do. Any ideas? Thanks!

"I've suffered with bad flatulence/bloating/stomach noises/burning/belching and generally a lot of gas related problems chronically for 8 months now. I also have constipation but it doesn't bother me as much, though it's still constantly there.
I'm on a restricted low carb/low fodmap/low sugar diet and don't snack between meals (only after dinner). Tried a few medicines, herbal teas and probiotics, don't seem to work at all. I've found that the low fodmap diet helps but I'm still really ill all the time and it leaves me depressed.
Anyway, I've been experimenting a bit with a little fasting because I've been having flare ups later in the day recently and I wanted to give my digestive system a break. Started a few days ago (2) when I skipped breakfast. I made sure to eat something light and take ACV before my lunch to get things kickstarted again, and that day I didn't have too much stomach uncomfortableness, only more bloating than I would usually have but that eased down eventually.
The next day I ate breakfast and felt terrible before dinner again, now today I've skipped breakfast again and feel a bit better too. (Worse than the first time but not like I've felt for the past week)
This can't just be a coincidence right? Usually when I feel bad it'll follow a pattern and then randomly change every 1/2 weeks.
What's causing me to flare up about 9 hours later?
I usually eat breakfast an hour after waking up.
It'll be something like poached/boiled/scrambled egg or omelette and lactose free/coconut yogurt with peanut/almond butter or my alternative of lactose free/coconut yogurt, fruit and some kind of nut. (Sometimes I'll have chia seeds. I always love cinnamon with my breakfast too, it adds a sweet kick without the sugar.)
I eat nut butter's sometimes with my meals or as a snack at the end of the day and don't notice any flare up symptoms related to them either. I don't know if it's the timing or what I'm eating, or if just skipping a meal makes it easier for my digestive system.
I hope I don't sound stupid.

"Hi,
So my pancreatic elastase is normal, however I have elevated putrefactive short chain fatty acids, indicating protein maldigestion.
If I have normal pancreatic function, what causes maldigested protein?
Another thing however showed I have low Chymotrypsin, but how can this be when my pancreatic elastase1 result is normal?
Any help appreciated!

"I came to the hospital where I still am on Wednesday (it is now Saturday) for what seemed like a textbook case of appendicitis. Symptoms included pain the right lower abdomen, well below the stomach, and bladder spasms when peeing (though no burning sensation when urinating or trouble emptying the bladder), as well as an elevated white blood cell count.
Although the appendectomy following a CT scan (with a false positive detecting a knot in the small intestine that turned out not to be there) on Thursday was a success, the resumption of solid food and termination of morphine and hydrocodone and antibiotics (the IV) on Friday resulted in the same pain returning with a vengeance, as if the surgery had never taken place. Additionally, the consumption of any food - clear liquids, solids or otherwise - caused severe bloating, cramping and pain in my stomach, in the same spot as before, and with more painful bladder spams than ever.
My hospital stay followed a trip overseas where I did not knowingly contract food poisoning, but that is the only unexplored explanation so far, along with gastritis and ulcers (though neither would cause lower abdominal pain and/or bladder spasms, presumably)
Ultrasounds of the kidney and bladder, a manual review during the laproscopy that preceded the appendectomy, multiple CT scans and blood tests have failed to confirm the source of the pain.
I have also not had a bowel movement in over 72 hours, though the pressure keeps building in my colon. I am able to release gas periodically though.
Any ideas on what else could be going on? To what extent would IBS (which I have) cause these lingering symptoms? The doctors at the emergency ward of the hospital are also stumped.

"Since lockdown started I got some anxiety and panic attack which eventually easy out and I got better, even seen a professional to get some help.
I had some right side pain, which was mostly bloating and I could feel it when I put my hand over it and I helped with some massage, but eventually it did go away but then came back again.
I got in touch with my GP and I got some mebeverine and it helped out and it stopped the pain when bloating.
During all this process, didnt have diarrhoea or sh*titng blood, all was good just bloating.
Also got some blood test to check if I am lactose intolerance and wheat and some liver tests. All came back negative.
Also done some home kit test with letsgetchecked such as colon cancer ( you never know.. ) and Coeliac but all of them came back negative.
I have to admit that bloating is basically gone but sometimes, If I lay down and I put my hand on the right side and I can eventually feel movements and then it starts to get a bit itchy inside or burning ( not sure what is the right term ). If I use my hand massage around the area I dont feel pain, not even if I put pressure so it is all good.
It mostly gets this itch/burning sensation if I leave my hand over the right side. I feel like it might be just normal if you leave your hand and it gets that sensation or maybe can it be an irritation such a Helicobacter pylori ? I ordered a test to see if it potentially is that so I am waiting.
It might sound crazy but I wish I can get that small sensation gone as I sorted out almost everything during the last months, from anxiety, panic attack and bloating.
Btw, I was diagnosed with IBS years ago and over the lockdown I eat more plant base food, but still eat meat now and then.
I have not lost weight and I can eat almost everything without any problems.
I wish I could see my doctor like face to face and explain a bit better but this pandemic made my GP a bit more hard to get hold and almost impossible to have a sit down with him.

"hello, I'm a 25 year old active and usually healthy male however I've had some health concerns over the past 8months or so. This began with sternum pain in which led to me having a panic attack (my first one in my 25 years). I went to the hospital to get it checked out and got a chest xray, bloods done etc and i was advised this was likely an muscoskeletal issue that would heal over time which it did however since this ive had issues from my sternum, to my back ribs and at my lower left ribs. I believe this is costochondritis although its never been diagnosed as I feel I can manage it fairly well and it seems to get worse if I'm stressed. Shortly after this i began having stomach issues that ranged from burning/aching to reflux and general stomach discomfort. This went on for a few months before I was told by the doctor that I had a helicobacter which was treated with a week of antibiotics. The course of antibiotics solved the reflux and thats just about it. Since then I still have constant stomach pain and other issues ranging from cramps, constipation, bloating and flatulence but most notably pain under my left ribs which is almost ever present. My bowel habits are often inconsistent and I've been advised by the doctor to use buscopan and fibogel although I don't feel that these have much impact. I feel that everytime I bring these issues to the doctor they are merely brushed off and my concern is that it may be something more serious. Does anyone have experience or had similar issues? if so what would you recommend. Thanks

"Hi there,
I have been posting on my horrible journey on the mental health/anxiety forum but just realised this onewas on!
I always had digestive issues but for a year/half my condition has worsened to the point where I'm nauseous every single day, vomitting once/twice a week, sleeping 5/6 hours night if I'm lucky..
I am on omeprazole, 40mg a day, 10 to 15mg of motilium and add sleeping pills to the lot as I can't fall asleep as stomach so uncomfortable.
endoscopy and colonoscopy are fine, blood tests too..
I have realised lactose is best avoided but apart from that it is difficult to say, feels like everything and anything makes me sick.
Apart from toast and crakers. But I can't live like this forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would appreciate any advice.. I feel like giving up medication for a bit as nothing but motilium seems to help..

"About 5 years ago, I went to the gym and was lifting a bench press and felt a pop in my chest and never been normal since. I was regurgitating food all the time and needed help fast.
I went to the GI Doctor and they ran and endoscopy and said I had a small hiatal hernia that was too small to be fixed and I was put on pantoprozole (Protonix) PPI and was taking them once a day all the way up to now and still doing so. I was also prescribed Sulcrafate (Carafate) Tablets for keeping myself from having ulcers or barretts esophagus later in life.
5 years later in my current status, I have been to another GI doctor and had another endoscopy to have it return back as normal with no hiatal hernia and then they ran ph monitoring 24 hours and manometry while I was on pepcid and Pantoprozle. They came back normal, with a detection of an abnormality of a centralized pressured area, they said they weren't sure if it was the hiatal hernia or not as results were inconclusive on that.
I now currently am back and forth with my GI doctor and she is not personable and very business straightforward meaning she only really talks to me when I come in or pay money for advice, and I have since then become very frustrated because I do not want to be on pantoprozole like this my whole life due to deficiency issues later that could occur.
She has since gotten me to take 2 pantoprozoles daily with pepcid twice as well and I occasionally use Graviscon and Carafate, and now she wants to put me on Effexor as an alternative therapy.
I am at a loss for what to do, my doctor seems to not be very personable and in my honest opinion care about what's going on with me and I just need advice.
Thank you.

"Hello Everyone,
My issues started when I was a child, coming into an adult it has gotten ten times worse. As a child I had a very hard time with going to the bathroom, I was always constipated, I could never easily go.
Fast forward to my mid 20's, I was constantly getting stomach aches, bad acid reflux and constipation.
About 2 years ago I started getting these ""attacks"". I would start having horrible stomach pain, eating and drinking made it worse. The pain would start in my upper stomach and work its way down throughout my stomach. It felt like someone was grabbing my intestines and squeezing them. With this, my body felt hot but i never had a temperature. I would not/could not poop until the attack was nearly over 2 days later, then it would just be straight diarrhea. I thought it was my stomach issues acting up/IBS or i had a bad reaction to some food.
In October of 2020, I started having one the attacks only this time it was worse, the pain was unbearable so i went to the ER. After some tests they said my pancreas was inflamed and my numbers were off the walls. I had to be hospitalized for severe pancreatitis. Doctors looked at my gallbladder, there was sludge in it but no stones. They took my gallbladder out anyways and said this should cure the attacks I was having.
Well I just another attack last month, similar symptoms, back to the doctor I go. More blood work was done, and i had to submit a stool sample to check for ulcers. All my tests came back clean.
They now want to go and do an endoscopy which i am reluctance because I have a narrow esophagus, I have a hard time swallowing food.
I also am having pain where my gallbladder was, its a dull, sometimes sharp pain which I am reading thousands of others are having similar pain.
I am starting to wonder if my gallbladder was the culprit after all.
I am still having stomach issues, constant stomach aches and bloating, acid reflux, always gassy, and seems like my stomach is protruding/bloating, kind of like i always feel like i ate a big meal.
I did send in my blood-work to a lab to see if i am sensitive to any foods, everything came back fine.
I am starting to feel defeated.

"Hello, for the past month I have had intestines/stomach problems. The symptoms are predominantly gurgling/meteorism after eating as well as when going to bed. I have occasional burping or passing of gas, especially in the morning or after eating. If I lay down on my left side the gurgling is way more than on the right side. I don't have diarrhea nor constipation. I don't really have bloating or pain either. The only other symptom is a feeling of tightness in my throat, I can swallow fine, just seems like the muscles there are tightened up a bit more, especially when I am stressed.
For the past 3 weeks I have been taking probiotics, but have not seen an improvement. I have done parasite tests (Blastocystis, Enterobiasis, worms), twice so far, and the results came back negative.
My diet consists of soups, chicken, dairy (feta cheese and yogurt; I have been eating these my entire life), vegetables (cucumber), and fruit (bananas and apples, although I have stopped the apples now).
Another note is that my brother started having similar (with the difference of also having constipation and bloating) symptoms 6 months ago and with him the symptoms appear to be getting worse, especially the bloating. He has also tested for parasites (3 times negative) and he had secretory IgA test performed (only thing shown there was a high secretory IgA in the stool). He has also tried taking probiotics, no effect it seems.
I also went to a gastroenterologist and he mentioned it is due to stress (I have never had as much stress in my life as in the past year), and prescribed another probiotic. I am not really sure, however, if this is indeed the cause or if it can be something else. I wanted to see if anyone else has had such symptoms? What would you suggest as a way to solve this issue?

"hello everyone i am new here i joined up in desperation hoping someone can help me and any tips to help ease the pain.
so i dont know if it is IBS but id say at least twice a year i get intense abdomen pain that is only relieved by passing a stool. my experience in detail is below to what exactly happened.
i have just had this experience a few hours ago so i woke up with intense stomach pain almost unbearable reduced me to tears almost screaming in pain i tried to pass a stool 1 hard lump came out and that was it, it was like i was constipated everytime i pushed the pain got more intense and started to feel sick and my body temperature must of gone through the roof as i felt really hot kept having splash cold water on my face. i think heat helps on the abdomen i got in the bath and put the shower head on my abdomen this seems to help abit. anyway about 30 mins had passed and i feel like i could pass another stool but couldnt move because of the pain so i passed a stool in the bath this time they were small hard lumps the pain was still there so i continued using the shower head another 10 mins had passed the pain had eased going from a 10 to a 9 so i decided to get back on the toilet this time it was sloppy like cow pat sloppy and then again but then it just turned to water after about another 10 mins the pain had almost gone. now i dont know if anyone else has had this but would be interesting to know and if they have got diagnosed with IBS. what i find strange is going from really hard stools then soft then sloppy then water all in the space of about an hour.

"Hi
About 7 weeks ago I had a bout of constipation for about 4 days, rare for me, then I started developing this pain under my right ribs, like a dull ache which turned into a stabbing pain, exactly where the gallbladder is.
I had a ultrasound as gallbladder was suspected, had blood test (including Liver) and Helicobacter pylori (stool sample), all of these came back fine.
I have been placed on Omeprazole, which is kind of helping, I am not getting the stabbing pains anymore, but I do get the dull pain sometimes directly after eating this can flick between left and right upper chest and sometimes about 1 hour after and generally feels like my lower right abdomen sore.
I also get a pain in the upper back behind the liver, just like some sitting on my chest. I find that Gaviston helps, but I only use that when it really bad. I would say I am an anxious person, I am a worrier, but I try to keep a cool level head, is it possible these symptoms could be stress related, my bowel movement and poo all ok.
I've seen a Chiropractor and looks like I do have tight rib cage muscles, I am in the early stages of treatment to loosen this off, so difficult to say if the entire reason I am getting discomfort.
I haven’t told the GP about the Chiropractor thing yet, though is it possible tight ribs muscles could be causing me this much discomfort? Though things with the GP have some to T junction, I have a phone consult next week, but what should I say to the GP, insist on being referred to gastroenterology?
Thanks for reading

Things i can't eat that have triggered intense cramping, irregular BM, stabbing pains all around the abdomen are: wheat,milk,cheese,cream cheese,beans,fizzy drinks. i never had a problem with these before but now i get bloating, gas its awful. I've always had random one off slight blood in my stool like once every three months. since stopping these foods its made a big difference i still get random pain but not constant.

"Hi guys, not sure if anyone has experienced anything like this before. basically approx 6 years ago, i started very randomly with nausea quite constant and gurgling tummy etc. What followed was lots of tests and things to try that i thought would help such as: stool tests for inflammation, h-pylori, blood tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, hida scan, lactose free diet, gluten free diet, fodmap diet, peppermint, ginger, anti nausea tablets from the doctor. nothing worked. the gastro discharged me with a diagnosis of ongoing IBS which i've had for approx 12 years anyway. I got depressed from feeling poorly all the time, so i was put on antidepressants, within weeks my nausea had gone. So me and my partner thought, it must have been anxiety? eventhough at the time, i didnt feel particularly anxious i dont think?! anyway, it didnt come back until i had a short break from AD's a few years back, so i went back on the AD's and it stopped again. Now i've been off my AD's for 8 weeks and its returned again.
Anyone else suffered similar? Obviously i'm massively swaying to it being anxiety related due to the relief the antidepressants give me from it. I completely stumbled across the 'cure' by accident due to feeling depressed and needing antidepressants all those years ago. very strange.

"About a year ago, i started feeling really dizzy. nauseous, etc. Felt really different than any sickness i felt before, but it went away. This was around last July. Around October 2019, I started feeling very mild abdominal pain and the next month I noticed some streaks of blood in my poo for a few days. Since then ive never seen blood. The pain has just gotten worse. This isnt just if I eat bad I get a cramp, every f***g minute of my life is pain. My entire abdomen (especially the lower right side) feels like theres a constant stitch. I cant do anything. Im 17, I had to leave school and I just cant deal with the worry of it being anything worse. We've gotten an abdominal x ray (they didnt even make me take the stuff to highlight your colon) and a few blood tests and stool tests for parasites and blood etc. They are now refusing to give me a CT scan/colonoscopy because apparently my symptoms dont warrant an emergency and bexause of covid so i have to wait 3 years apparently. I just dont want to live in a world where a concerned teenager thats living in constant pain and stress to the point where ive just been thinking of killing myself isnt right. Nothing helps, no change in diet, pain just is steadily getting worse. Feels like im just waiting to die. Any reassurance would be helpful but ive basically went through any option possible and im still just suffering in silence. Im a healthy kid, i was in shape, theres no reason for this to happen, no family history. But i am extremely lonely and depressed but i doubt that could make me have diaharrea 8 times in one day and be in pain 24/7. Feels like most of my stress would be gone if this st was gone. ****I cant leave my house, I cant do physically activity, i cant work, i cant do school. This is destroying my body and my life.

"for almost the past year i have struggled with what i think is ibs, i started taking ditropan (oxybutynin) for my hyperhidrosis. when i first started taking it i would get burning pains in my stomach usually around midday but that was the only symptom and i continued to use the medication. since around october last year the symptoms have gotten progressively worse. i constantly feel a huge amount of pressure in the left part of my stomach, my stomach makes constant embarassing noises and there is obviously discomfort in this area. i have tried simethicone for gas which helps a little but is shortlived, i have also tried peppermint oil capsules which work very well but are also a temporary fix. my doctor recommended osmolax which i took for 6 days as he thought it was gas buildup caused by constipation from the medicine but still no luck. i have stopped taking the medicine since last week and there is still no improvement. this is causing me to have many days off from school and severe anxiety which isn't ideal as i'm doing ATAR. i have also tried probiotics, a change in diet and all different kinds of gas relief. please help, what am i dealing with here?

"I came across this forum and kind of relieved to read about different people's experiences which are similar.
Short story and and would appreciate feedback on my situation.
I dont exactly know if I have IBS but upon checking other more serious symptoms (blood, mucus, constant cramps/pain)...i dont have those so i think thats a good thing and lend me to believe i may have IBS.
My bowel movements are quite regular (daily or every 2 days). I find it really helpful when i drink 2/3 glass of warm water right in the morning when i wake up and quite quickly after i pass quite a good volume of gas and sometimes you can hear audible stomach growling. the warm water somewhat serves as a trigger to help me activate and go to washroom.
Main point: when i go to the washroom, it often starts soft and pass quite easily but then the second half of it, it goes all mushy, diarrhoea like (just rushes out , not pure liquid but very soft mush). the stool is like a mix and gets me worried that i cant seem to pass solid consistently ...the stool is often a bowl of brown mush in the end. sometimes even after passing, my stomach/tummy still growls with very very subtle cramp like you might have some leftover.
sorry for the long post.
kind of worried...does it sound normal?

"Hi Everyone,
I am a 33 year old male & I have been suffering tremendously for almost 2 years now with a Chronic Gastrointestinal Condition, that has so far been undiagnosed. Below you can find my story. If ANYONE is experiencing the same thing as myself and has found a solution PLEASE POST BELOW. Any guidance is greatly appreciated at this point.
On the morning of October 4, 2016 my life changed as I knew it.
I woke up that morning with stomach cramps and severe rotten egg (sulphur) burps. Within minutes I was having explosive diarrhea. I cleaned myself out over the day, ate something during the night and the next morning it return again. The most off and bothersome symptom was the constant diarrhea accompanied by intense intestinal gurgling mostly felt on my upper left quadrant of my abdomen, the gurgling, the more intense it became the more liquid bowel movements I would have. So off to the ER I went.
There they did tests for C Diff, Bacterial Culture, Blood Tests as well as a CT Scan. Everything was negative. As a pre-caution they sent me home with 14 days of Flagyl. On day 4-5 I started to feel better. We now Fast Forward to 3 weeks off the antibiotics. The symptoms started to return just as aggressive as before. Back to the ER I went. The GI doctor I saw at the ER, scheduled me for a colonoscopy and endoscopy the following Monday morning. Tests were done, biopsy was negative and visually they saw absolutely nothing. I was told you could have IBS.
Over the course of the months following this I suffered tremendously and finally my family doctor sent in a referral to get myself followed my a permanent GI. (Here in Canada where I live, our Health Care if free but with limitations and crowded hospitals with lengthy wait times and appointment scheduling among many other things.)
This Gastro doctor wanted to get to the bottom of it. He told me at this point it could not be infectious due to length of period I had been dealing with it, so his first line was to prescribe me Imodium, Bentylol (Antispasmodics) as well as a Bile Acid Binder called Cholestyramine due to the fact that in 2011 (7 years ago) I had my Gallbladder removed. He also scheduled me for his own set of scoping tests including something called a Push Enteroscopy where they look further down into your small intestine.
I started the anti diarrhea medications. At first it was helping. 1 to 2 pills everytime I was really bad would stop the tap from running and let me go on with my day, as well as the Bentylol for the cramps. The Cholestyramine was being taken at 2 sacs a day but was unsure it it was working just yet due to the fact that it can take a month to see results. In the meantime he performed his series of scoping tests (Colonscopy & Enteroscopy) both were negative on biopsies and visually he saw nothing but clean intestines.
Over time the Imodium and Bentylol started to work less & less. It was at this point that I knew the Cholestyramine was no longer working so I stopped that. He prescribed me Lomotil as a substitution and opening taking it for the first time it reacted just as good as the Imodium did when I started it. While I was juggling with anti-diarrhea medications I was also experiencing with diets (FODMAP, SCD). If I stuck religiously to these diets the Rotten Egg Burps would not be present however I would still get the cramping, burning above my belly button abdominal pain as well as the loose stools and liquid diarrhea.
Fast forward to July 2017. My symptoms have now become so aggressive Imodium is no longer working (I could take up to 10 a day with lomotil and some Bentylol, and still have a liquid bowel movement) at this point my GI doctor thinks outside the box, he sends me for a stool test for my Calprotectin (Stool Inflammation) level and refers me to a doctor here in Montreal who specializes in SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), he also suggest a MRE (Like a MRI but for the small bowel).
The stool test comes back in the massive upper range of 2100 (Normal is below 150). The MRE however is negative. A positive stool test this high signifies Chrons or UC or some form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, however besides the elevated stool level all other tests so far show absolutely nothing. I see the doctor for a test for SIBO, a lactulose Breath Test. It came back elevated but not extremely high and due to the fact I had diarrhea when I was doing the Breath Test which can lower your results he was confident enough to diagnose me with Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth and claimed I got these from taking two many antibiotics during the 2016 year for a reoccuring dental and prostate infections I kept having and then in July of 2016 I came down with the stomach flu which consisted mostly of diarrhea and little to no vomiting which he stated destroyed me intestinal flora composition. His treatment was 14 day antibiotic called Rifaxamin and a decent probiotic to replace my beneficial bacteria.
I took the Rifaxamin as prescribed (which by the way is ridiculously expensive) and followed with probiotics.
While on the medication I was perfect. I thought I was cured..little did I know..this was just the beginning.
As I came off the medication once again all symptoms started to return! So my gastro put me back on it for 10 days and this time had absolutely no result from it. I was lost at this point, no clue what to do to help me or my situation. I had quit school (when all this originally started) was down to working 10 hours a week at a part time job, have a 6 year old daughter and a wonderful fiancee that I could never take part in any daily plans with them due to the fear or me pooping my pants (which has happened many a times by this point).
In a last ditch effort my Gastroenterologist put me on Entocort, a cortosteroid made for the treatment in Crohn's Disease. At first I thought it might actually be working. But after 3 months at the highest dose I realized it was not actually working. He re-tested my Fecal Calprotectin level and this time it came back at a low marker of only 45 so he considered the first test a ""false positive"" reading. I thought the Entocort had lowered it and he told me not from 2100 to 45, maybe from 2100 to 1500 but not that big of a difference. So he waited and tested again and it came back at 22.
As I sit here and type this on the forum I am still currently suffering from daily explosive diarrhea, chronic intestinal gurgling on upper left side of abdomen (which gets significantly worse after food) and sulphuric burps. I am currently on the waiting list for a Capsule Endoscopy however the doctor is convinced it won't find anything due to all the other tests showing absolutely nothing. I have also recently completed a 5-HIAA Urine Collection to check for rare endocrine tumors in my pancreas or small bowel, however I am assuming at this stage if it was a tumor especially in my pancreas it would have most likely spread and I would be hospitalized on the regular.
Below is a list of all tests and medications I have done and taken to try and diagnosis and solve my problem:

CT SCAN + CT ENTEROGRAPHY
COLONOSCOPY (X2)
ENDOSCOPY (x2)
ENTEROSCOPY
MR ENTEROGRAPHY

As well as Elavil and Desipramine which are anti-depressants to help slow bowel motility. I am currently trying Atrantil which is another supplement used for Hydrogen or Methane SIBO and I have been taking it 7 days now with no returned results. If anything my liquid diarrhea has been sent into overdrive.
This can't just be IBS like every doctor is trying to put it off to be. I know people who have IBS and they do not go to the bathroom 10-15 times a day pure liquid and have sulphuric rotten egg burps which accompany before these diarrhea episodes.
ANY ADVICE OR COMMENTS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

"Just realised that for years of having stomach related issues there are things that doctors have not tested me for at all. Had stomach issues since 2013 starting off mild to the point now where im in pain every day and even with a strict diet in still suffering.
Ive never had an mri or ct scan of the stomach, liver, kidneys or the small bowel. Can anyone tell me the benefits of why you would have one of these scans?
All ive had to date is endoscopy (found gastritis) ultrasound of stomach and organs. Full blood tests for celiac and allergies etc.
Not had colonoscopy they refused to give me one due to my age and no blood in stool.
Any other tests anyone can recommend? Doctors never seem to help they just put me on a 6 month waiting list to speak to a consultant which results in nothing...
So once again can anyone inform me of any benefits to having mri/ct scan of stomach areas? Or any other similiar tests to recommend?

"Hey, so here's the story. I've had these persistent gurgling sounds (not overwhelmingly loud but still tangible) in my intestines for about a year now. Nothing too dramatic (i.e. no pains, cramping or diarrhoea), just the sounds and mild constipation which has been with me for the past few years anyway. A couple of times I passed a bit of mucus after drinking the night before, but the main thing is the sounds. Generally speaking I feel them all over my colon but most intensely in the lower right and left quadrants, they are particularly prominent after I have just eaten and whenever I'm lying on my back. At some point last summer it really got on my nerves so I went to the doctors and had all sorts of tests done. Both blood and stool tests came back normal. Eventually my gastroenterologist ordered a colonoscopy. Then there's that. The lining of the entire colon was basically inflamed and swollen and so was the part of the small intestine they could get a look at. Now where I am from (Russia) they would tell you the severity of the inflammation by assigning a number to it or so I figured at least. So severity of my inflammation corresponds to 1 which is the lowest degree possible. 4 or 5 biopsy samples were taken and examined. The inflammation turned out to be about the same in every part of my colon. The diagnosis I got at the end of my entire colonoscopy adventure was ""chronic colitis with no signs of IBD"". Neither I nor my doc was satisfied with the diagnosis and got me to do more tests. Calprotectine, latent blood in the stool, C-reactive protein and tests for coeliac disease among others. All came back perfectly normal. At the end of the day, not a single one of those 4 or 5 doctors that I've visited has been able to pinpoint where exactly the problem lies and dismissed it as a form of IBS. Hence my question: has anybody in here who's suffering with IBS experienced anything similar and had their colon slightly inflamed at the same time? Thanks in advance! Andrej

"Good evening everyone, I am 37 year old male who has been struggling with bloating, nausea, lack of appetite and diarrhea for roughly 26 months now on a daily basis off and on, but no stomach pains or cramps. I have also lost around 7lbs in weight which i put down to lack of appetite and not eating very well. I have had numerous blood tests done as well as stool and urine samples which have all come back clear. I just cant seem to ease my symptoms and was wondering if anyone else has had the same symptoms.
I am normally fit and well conducting 3 lots of physical training sessions a week. I don't smoke and I rarely drink alcohol.
My GP believes my symptoms are IBS related but has booked me in to see a gastroenterologist to be on the safe side. Looking at having a colonoscopy or endoscopy dependant on the gastroenterologist consultation on Monday next week.
My symptoms make me emotional stressed which i have read that doesn't help with IBS but its hard not get stressed when you or the GP cannot pinpoint your symptoms nor diagnose accordingly.
Any help would be much appreciated.

"I’m desperate for answers and I wonder if anyone here has a similar issue.
I’m a 33 year old, normally healthy male.
About three months ago I suddenly had what I thought was food poisoning one Sunday afternoon. It was a feeling of terrible nausea that stayed that way for about a week. Since then the feeing has never quite gone away, and sometimes (three/four times per week) it goes up to an intensity that puts me to bed. Heartburn can often accompany the nausea, but it’s the sickness feeling, almost like a travel sick sensation, that is debilitating. Sometimes I can link it to foods that make it worse; heavy fats, lots of wheat, things that are very sweet. Alcohol seems to set it off too.
I'm taking 20mg Omeprozole
About 18 months ago I had a severe bout of Shigella. This went undiagnosed for some time and so the bacteria was living within me for some months. I wonder if this has something to do with my current issue.
So far I’ve had investigations into gallstones, an X-ray, CT Scan, multiple blood tests, and today an endoscopy. Ruled out are cancer, stomach ulcer, hiatus hernia, polyps, gallstones, blood conditions.
The remaining things to look into seem to be: a general gastritis brought on by the shigella, a food intolerance of some sort.
I am at a loss and my life is being taken over by this condition. The GP surgery is inconsistent with its care and I’m often seen by a new person every time I go. If anyone reads this and thinks they may relate or suspect it would be really helpful to hear from you. Thanks!

"Hey, I am a 24 year old male who is battling with strange abdomen / back symptoms. I will try to keep this short.
Since aug 2020 i've been dealing with symptoms consisting of loose stools, tenesmus, nausea, upper left back pain right under left shoulder blade - not a stabbing pain, more like uncomfortable like i've pulled a muscle.
I only have 1 of these symtpoms at time and they rotate in a random order every day. E.g when i'm nauseous i dont feel the back pain or tenesmus, but when i'm geting the upper left back pain i dont feel the other symptoms.
I've done stool samples, multiple blood tests, colonoscopy, endoscopy and a CT scan with contrast and NONE of these tests have found anything at all. Also went to a physiotherapist with my back problem but it haven't got any better.
I do have a history of health anxiety, I've been worried that this will end with a cancer diagnosis but i really doubt anxiety could be the cause of all these issues.
Symptoms are not geting worse, but its not geting any better aswell..
My doc wrote this off as IBS, but if it wasn't for the upper left back pain i would have accepted it.
So, in what direction should i go? Should i push for a scan for my upper back? What do you think could be the cause of all these things?
Would really appreciate if someone wants to give this a thought.
Take care!

For the past two years ive put everything on hold and i cant see it getting much better, i cant leave my house without needing the toilet ive had to stop working playing football and other activities due to this. Oh and i also havent left my city since too. Ive been trying new things for months i.e working out/diet began jogging again and lost plenty of weight ""needed"". I can go out but there MUST be a toilet near. The symptoms brought on anxiety, panic attacks very rarely but it does happen.
(Im only 22 and finding it difficult to see the positives) Doctors didnt know what it was now ive had several tests done its ***IBS*** i've taken medicine like omeprazole lanzoprazole mebevrine ranitidine and now currently been put on probiotics, none seems to help hoping the probiotic does. I just want to have somewhat of a normal life again and get back on track.

"So my stomach issues have been giving me some concerns, now i check my BMs to make sure there is no blood, and my symptoms have changed over the past months but ill explain what it was like in the beginning.
In June or July of 2020 I went to eat out and the night of i was in horrible pain, my stomach hurt, i felt hot , and pain pills werent cutting it. The pain would then happen 2/3 times a week ranging from bareable to ready to faint. The home i was living at the time was not very good at food upkeep (stuff would be unfrozen and frozen again) so i assume that that could have been messing my stomach. I left the home in december and had expriencee that level of pain once since then (its march 2021) my BMs used to be just pure diarreha not solid at all.
Now my symptoms have changed my BMs are more solid but flat, I feel bloated 3/5 times a week until I pass a BM. I dont know exactly if I have IBS and the pain has just went dormant or something serious.
small details
i am fairly active ( 12k steps a day)
I am over weight
When the pain started I was laying down at home all the time (no job due covid)
if you exprienced something like that please let know

"Hello!
I have never written in a health forum before but I am willing to look anywhere for help. I have always had a tricky stomach--constipation and especially gas. But when I turned 30 everything seemed to get worse. I saw one GI in early 2020 and was officially diagnosed wit IBS. Over the summer I even lost weight because I was so bloated and crampy I wasn't hungry. Since then I have had exams and blood work--all of which come back clean.
I am currently taking Linzess to help with the constipation and bloating--and it has. But, my bigger problem is this gas; even when my stomach does not feel or look bloated...I have this terrible gas. I am talking I can feel the bubbles in my stomach; sometimes even before I have eaten anything. I am on a Low Fod Diet, take Gas-X, avoid carbonated foods and gum. Yet, nothing seems to help.
My doctor says the next step would be an endoscopy and colonoscopy--even though nothing appears to be wrong. She says we can do it but it is a ""soft call"" and would be more for peace of mind. I am just wondering if anyone out there has experienced anything like this?
thank you for any insights in advance!

"Hey, I'm 28M and I've had IBS-related symptoms ever since I was a child. Never had blood ever, though.
Recently (since early March) my stool has been more on the mushy side. It doesn't really hold its form when it hits the water. Also, some of it kind of disintegrates when it lands in the water. My normal routine is that I've only been doing 1 bowel movement a day, in the mornings. Sometimes I'll do a smaller BM during the evening as well. 
I've had a lot of trouble explaining what my stool likes in the past, so I figured I'd just start capturing pictures of my stool so there's no confusion as to what it looks like. Also, I do apologize in advance if posting a stool pic link isn't allowed here!
Stool Picture - WARNING - NSFW (Not Safe for Work): https://i.ibb.co/25XBhxs/stools-1.png
That being said, since early March- I have pretty much not been eating any meat (except chicken on some days) or bread. I've been focused mostly on lentils and veggies like kale & brussel sprouts and there were a couple days where that's all I ate.
Would this be common with IBS or is it a strong indication of inflammation? If so, at what point should I be testing for ulcerative colitis and/or Crohn's?

"Hi,
So, I'm 25 years old and I've been having trouble with IBS type symptoms since Dec 2019. Trouble going to the toilet and straining and problems going to the toilet after eating food, as well as mild cramping throughout the day and then sevre cramping when needing the toilet after eating.
I've been in touch with my doctor in late 2020 and they didn't really give me any diagnosis or insight. The problems have been going on for months and only now have I been able to get in touch with a doctor who is wanting to give me a blood test and stool sample. I seem to be constantly in pain these days and sometimes the abdominal pain is so bad. I've tried almost everything to ease this including changing my diet, cutting out dairy and low fodmap, not much seems to be working. I'm now working myself up and thinking it could be something more serious. (bad I know) I was hoping someone had some tips and if anyone is experiencing the same type of symptoms/constant pain.
I also grt quite a lot of headaches but I've had regular headaches since I was 8.
any insight or help would be much appreciated.

From what I read the PPI never cures acid reflux and when people that start taking a PPI they end up on it for life. And also can the PPI cause a rebound effect even after 8 weeks of use which would mean I would have to slowly wean of them if I wanted to quit?

"Hi all
Please help me - I am a 26 year old female and have been suffering from bloating, gas, pain, mucus in stool, alternating diarrhoea and constipation for the past few months and I have also noticed red bits in stool, but it looks like tomato / red pepper skins.
I have been to my doctor who ordered blood tests and stool tests which all came back normal except I have low iron (not anaemic though). Tests which were normal included a blood CRP, FOBT and faecal calprotectin. Overall, my doctor thinks it could be IBS but wants to make sure all other causes are ruled out and referred me to a GI last week.
However, today I noticed a small amount of blood in mucus after having diarrhoea. I have had brown / orange mucus before but never with a little bit of blood. I did have diarrhoea yesterday / today - could haemorrhoids be the cause? I am so anxious!!
I have an appointment with a GI next week however I dont think I will be able to have the colonoscopy for at least a month - I am absolutely terrified and cant stop thinking the worst!! I really want to talk to someone like my family or partner but I dont want them to worry!

"Hi
i have recently been to the doctor as after a bowel movement i have been experiencing what i think to be a clear mucus leaking from my bum, its near on impossible to wipe myself clean without a shower and even with a shower i sometimes have to return to the bathroom to wipe again.
Ive had a blood test and 2 stool samples tested and the results were all clear, despite this i went back to the doctor as what im experiencing isnt normal, basically my bum feels moist all the time after a bowel movement.
The doctor recommended a low fodmap diet, this did help slightly but i think it was more a case of lower fibre intake so less bowel movement.
Im not aware of being intolerant to any kind of food, I know there is no cure for IBS but do my symptoms sound familiar to anyone elses?
i guess my next step is going to be a food diary and monitor it, chicken and rice here i come

I try to refrain myself from pooping everytime there's cramp. Few days back it was uncontrollable, I woke up with dry mouth and pooped watery stools. Pooped too much that my weight also went down. This is my first time having diarrhoea and cramps for than 2 days and it's worrying. I eat my meals regularly. Will I get better and are there any tips for me to get better?

"Perianal Fistula
My little nephew back in 2016 out of no where said his bottom was hurting and soon developed fever. With almost 2 months of multiple hospitalizations and doctors visits they concluded it is Crohn’s disease. But he had no symptoms none what so ever. His MRI has no inflammation, his Cal proteins were normal. He only had fistula that soon became infected and this kid had setons put in place for 4 yrs and just got healed and is free of setons for the last 8 months. He is on Remicade highest dose.
Today in the routine annual MRI they are suspecting a new perianal fistula in a different location.
What are we missing here?? Is it really Crohn’s or something else ?
Please can someone share any info if you know. Or ask anyone you know may have experienced this.
All GI both at John Hopkins and Boston children’s keep saying Crohn’s but this child has never ever displayed any symptoms as stated until now except that fistula that started back in 2016. Not even a single biomarker test inclined towards this being CD.
Kindly help. Are we missing something else unrelated to CD?
Thank you in advance.

i slept with a new person on December 13th and i had no symptoms of any STD/STI But I was paranoid stressed and freaked myself out thinking i did after my sister said i could have something and i should get tested and ever since she said that i had very mild slight like period cramping pain in my lower stomach/ lower back pain so of course I Google everything and my main problem was thinking i have herpes/hiv but i went to my normal doctor and she tested me for the other STI (they were all negative) besides those two because I showed no symptoms of those specific STD and blood tests are not very accurate she said and she said that im fine Because herpes doesn’t cause stomach pain in less it’s reoccurrence but anyway back to my point lol. i think i have IBS or Crohn’s disease because I’ve always had loose watery diarrhea for as long as i can remember a couple years ago I brought it up to my DR and she said it was from my anxiety but i think the stress of looking and thinking i have some sort of STD brought on that very mild stomach cramping like a flareup of IBS or something because my diarrhea got even watery when i was stressing out about maybe having something.
basically what I’m asking is have any of you that have been diagnosed with IBS when you’re stressed out do you get a flare up?
symptoms I have
I get heartburn quite a bit and they told me I had Gerd or acid reflex i cant remember what they said but i get heartburn about once a week
i’m pretty gassy all the time sometimes I get that slight stomach pain when I have to fart but it goes away after I do
i always Pee a bunch (idk that’s related to my anxiety or drinking a bunch of water or IBS)
i poop like 2-5 times a day (sometimes more) always diarrhea - sometimes more watery with mucus than other times that’s stomach pain comes with that too but goes away after i poop
also sometimes it feels like I can’t completely finish and maybe that’s why I’m always on the toilet
sometimes too right away when I wake up in the morning I have to use the bathroom extremely bad
i usually always have a headache maybe from IBS or my anxiety
i’ve never been constipated before The only time I’ve ever been constipated is the week before I had my gallbladder surgery to have it removed because I had such bad gallstones witch was in 2018
I usually always have a stomach ache after eating anything sometimes I get nauseous to after eating
also sometimes I get these weird leg pains has anyone ever had them with IBS?
i go back to the doctors to get a pelvic exam on the 22 (because I’m turning 21) so im going to ask my dr. all of the same questions but in the meantime I was just wondering if any of you have the same symptoms.

"Over many years now I have suffered with stomach problems that my GP has always said was IBS and this has come and gone sometimes for months, lots of stomach pain.
Lately however I seem to be going to bed at night feeling fine, then being woken in the night with stomach pains which last through to say 10am and then gradually fade away and everything is fine through the evening, off to bed and the cycle continues.
Any suggestions as to what this is and what may help with the pain.
Thanks for reading.

"Hello. I am 48 about 250 pounds ( lost 12 pounds recently) and no health insurance. For the past several weeks I have been super bloated, I might use the bathroom once a day if I'm lucky. I just recently quit drinking and smoking ( 3 days ago ) and I hit them hard for the past 4 years.
My feet and hands are numb, my wounds don't heel. I have open cracks in my heels. Doing some research, it seems I have diabetes and GERD and a poor circulatory system ( I could be wrong on these )
I completely changed my diet past 2 days, basically I'm eating like a vegan ( very difficult )
I'm desperate for help, I want to live so I can look after my ailing mom.

"Hey everyone,
For a very long time I have had pretty bad gassy spells that would last for days. I don't think it's lactose intolerance because it never happens after I consume dairy and it tends to occur in the evenings. Last year I also used to get a short bout diarrhea every month.
I have been reading about IBS for a year now and have sometimes worried that I could have it. Even if my problems are mainly to do with gassiness I still worry that it could be IBS.

"Hi all
I've been having IBS symptoms for the past few months or so and I have noticed bright red bits in my stool occasionally however this has mostly been after eating red pepper or tomato and looks like skin.
However the past couple of times I have noticed red bits in my stool I haven't eaten peppers or tomatoes. The only red thing I have eaten is some watermelon - can this cause bright red bits in stool or is it blood? The red bits also dont look like skins. The red bits are noticeable but dont colour the toliet bowl water red or anything.
I'm seeing my doctor and going to ask for more testing ASAP.

"I've always suffered with IBS to some degree and it got significantly worse after a stressful time 3 years ago.
Symptoms worsened again after some fasting and bad diet about 6 weeks ago. Alongside the usual diarrhea and malabsorption etc. I now have a pretty much constant dull ache/low grade pain in the upper right quadrant of my abdomen. Probably 2 inches to the right of my belly button and an inch or 2 below my ribcage. It does seem to be less noticeable sometimes especially when I first wake up, but it does seem to be always there for the last 6 weeks or so. Passing gas seems to make it less severe but I can't really find any other patterns like bowel movement or eating that have a significant impact on the ache. I have had maybe 3 or 4 days that I couldn't actually notice it but there seemed to be no cause as to why. I also now will get a numbing ache on the left side that does come and go but I think it just masks the pain on my right side when it's happening.
I am going through this with my doctor and will submit a stool sample next week and I have done a little fodmap'ing but probably not enough to make much difference. What I'd really just like to know is if a constant ongoing pain like that is really possible with IBS as well as most of the literature mentions pains coming and going etc. It does have me quite anxious and I won't get answers from docs for a while at least.
Sorry for the long rant, I just wanted to try to get across how it is manifesting.
Thanks for any info/help!

"For the last 2 months I have been having right side cramping (near belly button) and bloating after I eat too big of meals or meals containing a lot of fatty foods. The cramping isn't super painful but constant almost everyday especially when I am sitting and working. It's make it very hard to work and the dull pain really starts to weigh on me by the end of the day.
Cramping is relieved by: Working out, moving around, sleeping, lorazepam and heat pad
Doctor visits: 2 doctors ruled out appendicitis, blood was fine, told me it sounded like IBS
Things I've tried: Cutting gluten, cutting lactose, cutting artificial sweeteners, and a few other foods, doesn't seem to respond to food (besides the overeating/fatty foods mentioned previously)
Medications: I have had panic disorder for 5 or 6 years now so I keep a bottle of lorazepam and when I took one for one of the worst panic attacks I have ever had (from worrying about the pain) it relieved all my cramping. A week later I tried using it again and it worked again and relieved my pain for 2 days.
Not wanting to take lorazepam consistently my doctor prescribed me Hyoscyamine Sulfate (an anti spasmodic) And the Hyoscyamine had absolutely no effect and maybe made the pain worse after using it for a few days. Also tried a peppermint supplement that had no effect.
Does this sound like IBS? Does this sound like something else? I have been looking into the pain and bloating being all psychological so maybe thinking of asking about SSRIs.
Additional information: Bowel movements are fine and regular, no additional sounds from my stomach, I have very little stress and I am very happy otherwise. The pain is definitely making life much harder. I usually get panic attacks from being overly sensitive about sensations in my body.
Thank you for reading.

"I'm a 48 year old male non smoker occasional drinker. I was diagnosed with IBS in 1998 when I was 26 years old and have symptoms ever since. I have noticed when I have gas or heartburn I have a headache which feels like a tension headache, no aura not very painful just like a vice squeezing. I have been to numerous doctors and they pretty much pass it off as anxiety.
IBS symptoms are, diarrhea , heartburn, gas and occasional cramping.
Non GI symptoms headache and lately sexual problems ( which is prolly anxiety related cause my mind is always pre-occupied with the IBS and other symptoms.
I've modified my diet I have cut red meat in half, no potato chips rarely any cookies or other pastries. Anybody experience anything related?

"Hello
Wondering if any of you can help or if you have any similar symptoms?
i started getting abdominal pain in the upper left side of my abdomen around 4 weeks ago, i wouldn't say it was severe pain just a dull ache, the pain seems to move around my abdomen the lower left side the centre and the upper right side. sometimes the pain on the upper right side is more severe and can prevent me from sleeping, however this pain has only happened twice in 4 weeks ( once was a severe stabbing pain the other was cramping like my body was being crushed.
my bowel movements have been changing from constipation to looser stools.
I also never feel hungry anymore, i wouldnt say that ive lost my appetite as i am still eating 3 meals a day but i just never feel hunger pains anymore if that makes sense. I had this symptom early last year during a flare up but it passed.
ive been to my GP who conducted blood tests and a 2 stool samples
the stool samples came back fine. My blood tests were fine apart from B12 and Folic acid were on the lower end of the normal range so was prescribed some folic acid tablets for a month. They also said they did a slight test for coeliac disease which came back as ""slightly unlikely"" that i have it.
My GP seems to think it is just my IBS but i worry it could be something worse as even though i have had flare ups of IBS in the past it passes within a few days to a week, this pain has become more constant so i am wondering if anyone else has IBS pain that lasts this long? I do suffer really bad health anxiety so keep thinking its something bad when it probably isnt.

I am 26 years old and start having attacks in october. It is now jan and I still havent recieved any help from my doctor. I have been sent for ultrasounds, blood tests and now have to see a GI. My pain is exactly as some people written on here. It will start with a cramping feeling and my stomach will start making noises then im in the bathroom hunched over crying and screaming in pain. Sometimes im able to go to the bathroom alot and its non stop for hours in and out of the bathroom and sometimes im only going little bits at a time still in and out for hours. Either way the pain is absolutely unbearable. I feel like I am going to die the pain is so bad. It becomes so much I become light headed and dizzy because the pain is so excruciating. I am honestly so scared and looking for anyone who has any ideas to ease the pain because I cant take it anymore its easily the worst pain I have ever had in my life and I have gone though child birth. If anyone has any ideas or help I beg for them. Thank you everyone.

This didn't seem to work either. I don't know what to do anymore.. And i called my doctor today many times and then was told he was gone for the day. Doesn't matter if i eat or not.

"IM 25 YO MALE
For past 10 days ive had very loose stools like runny ice cream, and a few cases of watery poo, with the odd normal stool,
This morning I woke up and passed a normal sized stool then seconds later followed by agony pains all over my belly, starting in upper middle and going to the left then down then I pass water stools this carried on for 2 hours going to toilet around 15 times.
I also feel sick with this as well
Abit of background
For over a year ive been having on going belly pain mainly lower, Ive had 3 stools samples done 6 months + ago all normal, 2 weeks ago i notice I tiny amount of blood in my poo and then it happened once more next day, 2 weeks later not notice any more.
Ive had ultra sound with normal spleen kidneys gallbladder ect, I have a fatty liver
I had an endoscopy back in February all normal
Ive had an small bowels MRI 5 weeks ago and still waiting on results, ""Consultant was on call for 2 weeks so he hasn't had chance to look them over""
Loads of bloods all normal, A little high CRP infection rate of around 7-10 I think in pass 2 tests
What worries me is bowel cancer or any other time of cancer,
I cant stop thinking the worse when Im in pain all the time and now with this week how bad its been
The only thing ive noticed is the 2 times ive had watery poo in past 10 days is the day before I had a ""fatty"" meal, Like Chinese takeaway or burger and chips, or chip shop
Last night I had a chicken burger and fries from frankie and bennys and 12 hours later I had another episode so to speak of what ive had in the past week.
ALSO 1 week ago I was in agony in bed with my belly, then I passed wind for around 10 seconds then had to rush to the loo for once again watery poo, and why I was on the loo I kept passing so much wind like ive never ever had before it was horrible
Im not saying its linked as I have takeaways alot and never experiences this but It might be
Any thoughts anyone

"Hi,
I've had IBS for years (I'm 22), but since a 6-hour car journey just over a year ago where I had bad IBS-D the whole time, it's caused me severe anxiety. Every service station we passed, we had to stop at, and on many occasions I thought I wouldn't make it to the next one. I've never been so uncomfortable in my life and I felt trapped, anxious and panic-y in the car for the whole journey.
Ever since I've developed severe anxiety (I've always been slightly anxious/nervous but this is way worse) to the point where I went months without even leaving the house, cancelled a holiday last minute because I couldn't face the journey to the airport or being trapped on the plane, and have been to A&E before with panic attacks.
Now I can manage short car journeys (about 10/15 minutes) but anything longer just causes me to freak out because I worry that my IBS will kick off whilst I'm stuck in the car. I have to know where the bathroom is everywhere I go. For the last year I've mainly been stuck indoors, too terrified to go anywhere and having to take medication for my anxiety.
The worst thing is that my anxiety makes my IBS worse, which then makes my anxiety worse, and it's just a vicious cycle.
I really don't know what to do. I've tried CBT (it didn't help). I take Imodium when I do have to go out but that doesn't always cure the upset stomach that I get. I've tried changing my diet but it hasn't helped as I think my IBS is mainly caused by anxiety and stress (which, ironically, it caused in the first place).
I don't know how to break the cycle and I don't know how to start living my life again without constant fear of having an 'accident'. Please help!

"For months my bowel movements have been sticky/fudgy/sludgy and I can't find out why online.
I am 70 and developed IBS-D at 44. It was also the last time I vomited. It came out both ends as I awoke and barely made it into the bathroom. That began many years of misery and accidents. Then about 6 years ago it began alternating with constipation, which then changed over to constipation. but with still a few more D accidents. (I'm glad something made me look up Milk of Magnesia, which is the sure cure for me).
Now it's better than either of the others but still not good. Unless I wait a couple of days to harden it, it's soft and difficult to end without it continuing in small dribs and drabs after I can do no more. There's no blood or other symptoms, and I still sometimes get the feelings I got when I had D for about 16 years when, with no warning, something tells you to stand up to go to the bathroom - and then it's already too late. Three times in one hour, ten years ago. And with this current thing I still get slight feelings of urgency like before, with no accidents, but when I go it's all mush and the problem with that is that it's so nasty to wipe and takes so long to do it.
Another strange thing is if I have no urge to go before a day or so of waiting for the bowel contents to firm up, I'll be solid at first, but the mush invariably follows.
A few weeks ago, around the time the mush situation developed, so did rumbles and horribly stinky rotten-egg farts, which I'd never had before. (They seem to be gone these last few days - and I had never had much in the way of digestive sounds before, either.)
There is no blood. fatigue, or any other symptoms involved. No change in diet or living conditions.
Now, it's better than the other conditions, but still so unpleasant, and I'm wondering just what's going on here? I don't want or need to see a doctor.

"Hi all,
I've never written on a forum before, but i've been having a very tough time, so I decided to give it a shot. I've had IBS symptoms for many years, but just recently started taking medication for it (10mg Dicyclomine). The main issue I am having is that my anxiety gets so high when i'm driving or when I'm in a place that i'm not comfortable using the bath room, that it is very much interfering with my life. I just started taking a small dose of Lexpro and seeing a therapist, so I am praying my life will change.
I guess I just wanted to reach out to anyone out there in this big world who is also experiencing anxiety due to their IBS. I will appericate any advice or information anyone can provide me.  Thank you for reading my words.

"Hi all,
So I was first diagnosed with IBS when I was a child but I never really understood how it affected me. I've assumed I've always gone through life without it! Until recently.
Last weekend, I became unwell a couple of hours after eating a roast dinner I had cooked. I started with horrendous cramps, very very bloated and gassy, couldn't go to the toilet for days, no appetite, just feeling generally run down and wasn't sleeping because of the pain. I immediately knew it was IBS. The cramps are just the worst, I can deal with the other symptoms but the pain is awful.
So I'm on my 4th-5th day of this flare up and can tell it's easing away (thank god!). But during the last few days recovering, I've been thinking about what it could be that triggered it and other related incidents that I never considered before.
Initially - I was dead set it was the cauliflower I made. Cauliflower, cabbage and sprouts give me such bad gas for days after. That's always been the case for years and years and I eat a lot of veg with my food. But usually that's just the extent of it, I don't get anything as severe as I've had this week. So I couldn't help but think it was something else. I thought back to the meat I cooked - I made lamb but usually when I get lamb, I buy a leg and cook it fresh - this time, my partner brought home one of those tray bake ones from the supermarket that you cook from frozen to try. When I cook meat, I do it (usually accidentally!) so it's cooked throughout with no pink. But this time, it was a little bit pink and my partner was happy with it.
I thought back then to just a couple of months ago - we went to a meat restaurant for our anniversary (with a large selection of cut meats) and literally within 10 minutes of leaving, I got this awful cramp in my stomach and as soon as I got home, I had violent diarrhea and was convinced it was food poisoning. I had eaten a cut of meat my partner hadn't and so put it down to that. But now that I think about it, some of the meat we were having was more pink/rare than I would usually have it cooked if I were to be asked. So I think it was IBS for definite now.
So I'm going to have to be careful with the cooking of meats from now on as I don't want another spell like this week. It's really drained me! I feel for those who have chronic IBS and are very sensitive to a lot of foods.
Just wondering if anybody else has similar triggers? I know I'm really sensitive to dishes like curry, certain vegetables and now clearly, red meat! It's not something I've linked together before so would be good to hear from other sufferers that might help me identify if your triggers also trigger mine.
So good to be able to speak to others too. x

"Hello everyone.
I was on antidepressants (Xanax and Clonazepam) around 2 years now, and started tapering it off slowly around a year ago. Since I went under 1mg of Clonazepam per day, these very irritating IBS like symptoms started to show up. Irregular bowel movements, chronic Constipation etc. Doctors cannot find anything wrong with my gut, and I also tried Ayurveda which didn't help. So I blame it on Benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. It's said that cuz nerves in my brain are connected to my Gut, and when those nerves get messed up (like they do when on antidepressents), your gut also get messed up.
So, Do you guys know any way to reduce the IBS symptoms caused by drug withdrawal?
Thank you very much for any input.

"Me: 35-year old white male, slightly overweight (not obese), non-smoker and occasional drinker. I have no underlying conditions and am generally in good health. I rarely even get colds.
Nearing now 4-months ago I went to Urgent Care complaining of mild chest and abdonimal pain. The pain was transient and I can only describe it as the sensation of being somewhat painfully poked in various parts of my chest and upper abdomen. At the UC they did an EKG, urinalysis and chest x-ray. All were normal. The doctor insisted I had anxiety and sent me on my way. I can be an anxious person, this is true, but I know what I feel like when I'm anxious and this wasn't it.
A few months go by and it never fully goes away, but it's more uncomfortable than painful so I just learn to live with it. Then about a month ago I start noticing it more. The chest pains and abdominal pains seem more frequent and hurt just a little more. Again, not so much painful just super uncomfortable and unnatural feeling . I decide it's time to see my GP and make an appointment. The annoying thing is they only do initial video visits because of Covid-19, but it's better than nothing.
A week before the appointment I'm awoken at 4-am to chest pain. It's centralized to the center of my chest and feels like and intense cramping/tightening. I call the 24-hr nurse hotline setup by my insurance and am told to go to the ER to be sure it's not my heart. Once there they do a complete blood workup and another chest x-ray. Normal tests again. The ER doctor is perplexed but doesn't think I'm in any danger as the feeling passed. He's circling some kind of indigestion causing it and tells me to take Mylanta if it happens again.
The week leading up to my video doctor appointment is much of the same. The same chest pains. The same abdominal pains. Sometimes I feel like I have some burning or tightening sensation in my abdomen, but THAT could be anxiety as that's how I normally present and now I actually am starting to get anxious. I try Nexium and Mylanta to see if they help. They do not. In fact the moment I start the Nexium I start having upset stomach, so I only do it for 5-days and stop.
The video appointment with my doctor is pretty much the same schpeal I've gotten with the UC and ER doctors. He thinks it's anxiety, indigestion or it's something muscular-skeletal. I tell him my concerns that Dr. Google told me of stomach cancer and esophageal cancer, but he tells me I'm too young and my symptoms don't really align. Esophogeal he says I'd have trouble swallowing and stomach he says in all his years he's only ever seen 1 case of someone my age having it.
Since the video appointment on Oct. 31st, mild constipation and bloat have set in. I've always been super regular but now when I go and it's not super productive. I will say that my bowel movements look healthy to me when I do manage to go. I don't have diarrhea. I also noticed after meals I have chest pressure that goes away after a while until I eat again. As for the abdomnial and chest pain, the chest pressure seems much the same but the abdominal pain seems to be moving around and now I've had pain in my flanks. The pain doesn't seem to favor a side.
With this extra symptoms I've made an appointment to see my doctor in-person this coming Friday, but I'm at somewhat at a loss. Could it be anxiety? Maybe. Could it be being stuck in a chair all day working from home during Covid-19 and not being active? Maybe. I'm at the point where I am leaning on something gastrointestinal even though Dr. Google tells me all the awful things are happening to me.
Has anyone out there had anything like this happen or can anyone provide any insight? Much appreciated.

"Hi guys, i've read a few of these and was hoping anybody could share if they've had a similar experience of what i've had for the past 2 months.
So started with a pain in my shoulder blade that went down into my arms, phoned the doctor who guessed a trapped nerve and prescriped diazepam and co-codamol.. Came off diazepam and upped co-codamol to 30mg. Took this for another 4 weeks to try and manage pain when one night I took a turn with it and had burning stomach pain. Doctor said to come off co-codamol and gave me something a bit gentler.
Kept going back as pain was persisting and had moved in my lower back on both sides along with the stomach pain (shoulder and arm pain had now gone). Doctor then passed me off to a nurse with suspected UTI (never had pain when going to the toilet so i wasnt convinced) who prescribed 2 rounds of antibiotics, stomach settlers, acid reducers - i think in the space of 2 months they tried 11 different tablets before they saw me face to face due to the covid situation. When the nurse finally saw me she noticed some tenderness in my abdomen on the right side, just below my bellybutton so suspected potentially kidney or gallbladder problems (this is consistent with the shoulder pain i started off with). Blood, stool and urine tests have all come back fine so they havent offered to do any scans.
Fastforward to 5 days ago - back pain has gotten worse significantly on the right side just below my ribs, i can barely eat anything due to the burning pain in my stomach, i've had a high heart rate and a temperature for weeks. Had to phone 111 as resting heart rate was sitting between 120-140 and felt generally unwell. Saw an oncall doctor 4 days ago who rushed me to hospital with suspected bleeding in my ovary which turned out to be fine. Now just off the phone with another doctor (i havent been able to contact my own gp since the start of this as he's been away for weeks).
This doctor has pretty much just told me to stop calling and wait until my gp is available again. He has looked over my notes and says its IBS and I should get used to it and has offered to prescribe me with 2 tablets that should help my symptoms - 1 of which i have already tried and didnt work.
I've looked at the symptoms for IBS and i just don't fit a lot of them. Pain doesnt go away after going to the toilet, i dont have any stomach cramps, there is no mucus in stool and i'm not passing gas more than normal. I do have mixed bowel habits and i haven't noticed any triggers with food or anything as i simply haven't been able to eat enough due to the burning pain in stomach and nausea. The burning pain does get worse after eating though.
I just dont know if i should accept the IBS diagnosis considering i've been offered no other scans so feels much like a way to get me to stop pestering them. Some times the pain is so bad i cant walk normally - i'm 20 years old so im also scared i just dont want to accept that this will be me with this pain for the rest of my life. Any help/guidance or even just your own experience would be appreciated x

"hi people, i need someone to nicely explain why this has happened? it's this: i am a ptsd victim, i have had support off a counselling service which is voluntary. now right at the end of this year, which is what they offer, i am informed by the clinical lead that she'd recommend i speak to community mental health. i was assaulted i don't take medication, i don't have a cpn i speak to, i have NEVER been in a mental health unit and am fighting physical ill health as well as mental ill health. is this where everyone suggests, if so why? doctor's put you on pills, for over 12 years my doctor's misdiagnosed IBS which is coeliac disease! i don't want ANY antidepressants in my system! i was raped, i have comlex PTSD. what else can i do besides have crxx mental health written on my doctor's notes for all to see? i went to just sleep without flashbacks. i know it seems strange putting this on here but does anyone know about the medication side. i absolutely don't want antidepressants! thanks

"Hello everyone,
I'm pretty stressed this year, so I'm wondering if it's causing this new symptom ?
The ibs isn't too bad, but every night when I go to bed my stomach starts churning and bubbling with gas. I wake up a few times in the night and it's stopped, but every morning without fail I wake up bursting to pass a huge amount of wind.
It's not painful, just annoying.
Am I the only one who gets this ?

"Hello
I hope this thread is still open as I am going crazy and I can see you guys are pretty open and share valuable information . here's my story.
About 1 year ago I started having diarrhea while I was in Florida for vacation this went on for the entire week I was there. I came back home had a few more normal stools but I would have diarrhea every 3 days . then after a few weeks it got so bad where I was having it everyday sometimes 4 5 time it was terrible. I talked to my Doctor and she recommended a stool TEST which came back negative and then she said ok fair enough u need a colonoscopy . I had my colonoscopy in NOV. 2016 and it came back no issues. Doctor said my colon was perfect no issues and said my prep was amazing very very clean which makes me happy as I assume he got a good look at it. well after 3 weeks I went back to discus and immediately he said yeah you have IBS. No other tests , Just colonoscopy and he said sure you have IBS. Also he checked my prostate which I was asleep and said that looked good too. SO yeah I am happy about that BUT my life is a mess as I still think something else might be wrong with me. I am just always worried I still have diarrhea/Flat stools and grooves/ridges on my stool it's like someone took a toothbrush and ran it down your poop( sorry for the detailed info) Doctor said it's normal to have ridges grooves as is due to slow transit/ and when body needs water it get's it from there i guess some weird explanation . I also had a CBC test so i can get my blood check after . I wanted to amke sure we are not missing anything.
So I only had 3 tests and been diagnosed with IBS
-Stool test
-Colonoscopy (10 months) ago
-CBC test
all were good.
I am worried that doc might have missed something as I always have either diarrhea or flat groove stools.
I asked the opinion of a different Gastro and said he thinks I am fine and need more fiber but he wanted to do a Barium enema which I said no cuz it was optional. Doc said Colonoscopy si KING and since I already had one there is no need for another one.
I am thinking about getting another colonoscopy JUST to be sure doc didn't miss anything the first time.
Can you guys PLEASE SHARE YOUR Toughs I need someone to talk to I am quite persona nd don't ahve a lot a friends to talk about this subject. thanks guys

"Hi everyone.
I wonder if anyone is going through a similar situation to me.
On and off, for the past few years, ive been suffering with nausea as my main symptom. Sometimes to the extent of throwing up. I'm still able to eat, but straight after eating the nausea starts again.
I've been diagnosed with IBS after having an MRI of my bowels (i haven't had a colonoscopy). I've had an endoscopy, which also came back normal, along with blood tests and stool tests.
the doctors don't seem to understand what is causing the nausea.
As for my IBS symptoms, I mainly suffer with constipation 80 percent of the time, with diarrhoea 20 percent of the time. I've tried eating more fibre and laxatives, this doesn't seem to help my constipation - if anyone else has any advice, id appreciate it.

I also suffer anxiety which makes IBS symptoms worse and vice versa. So I do take 10mg citalopram for that. But feel like if I could better manage the IBS I'd probably have less anxiety.

"Hi, I'm new to the site and hoping to find anyone with any similar symptoms/advice?
It has been almost two years now, I have been suffering with bloating, cramps, and constipation. My doctor took a blood test and stool sample. Results clear. I was diagnosed with IBS. Shortly after I kept getting Anal pain after BM and assumed I had piles or a fissure as a result of constipation. I was taking daily stool softener to help. Doctor examined me and no visible signs of piles but treated me for them as possible internal, treatment failed so next i was treated for a fissure, I used GTN cream and again treatment failed. It has been ongoing for so long and really affecting my life, I have just had a sigmoidscopy four weeks ago and the results were clear. The consultant said it is muscle spasm related.
He wants me to try Amatriptaline medication but I'm really reluctant too and would rather try a natural/healing way if possible.
My anal pain is only after a BM and lasts for the duration of that day. I wake up the next day and the pain has gone. I usually have BM every 2-3 days so almost have a day pain free but then on days that i go I then suffer anal pain. As you can imagine this is causing anxiety and depression and feel stuck in a rut.
Anyone have similar symptoms or experience?
Thanks

"Hello everyone
This is really embarrassing for me, but I don’t know what to do.
In August 2019, I was on a 3 day school trip together with my class and I drank a lot of alcohol and Cocio. (I drank more alcohol and Cocio on those 3 days than the rest of my life combined)
After the school trip I’ve had issues with how terrible my flatulence is.
When I’m at home my flatulence is fairly normal and it is similar to what it was before the trip and it is virtually always relatively loud and fairly odorless.
But when I leave my home and go to crowded places my dead silent flatulence gives a disgusting and foul smell.
It has completely destroyed my self confidence and I’ve become seriously depressed.
Last year I had to leave my school because of this issue.
A few months ago I went to a gastrointestinal specialist, and they performed a sigmoidoscopy on me and said everything was normal. I also had a lactose intolerance test and these results were also normal.
On the 21st October 2020 I'll have an appointment to a specialist again.
I would appreciate it if you could help me.

"Interesting reading all these comments. I am a male age 49 and have been experiencing severe ibs symptoms for several years now.
Lose watery stools, lower abdominal and back pain, hip pain, food intolerance and anxiety and depression.
I have had blood and stool tests, sigmoidoscopy, chest xray and am awaiting ultrasound in a couple of weeks.
I just can't believe how bad I feel everyday and it's just ibs. I am exhausted all the time, just with worry.
I was recently taken to a & e with suspected heart attack, but they discovered a hiatal hernia. I also have diverticular disease.
Could all the symptoms I am experiencing be because of these two issues or is it something else..

"I have a severe form of IBS, a 24 hr event in my life. It is to the point where it cripples me, with my whole lower left side of my abdomen swollen and sore. It makes it hard to eat since I have so much crappy gas and pain. I literally have to drink a large amount of liquid combined with a ""catalyst"" usually the equivalent to 2 cups of coffee, stand up, and bend at at angle to take a bowel movement. Worse yet, is the amount of crappy gas and pain that occurs after I take a bowel movement. Which the only way I can relieve is a combination of large amounts of liquid, occasional sips of an energy drink, and brute force (literally hundreds of push ups throughout the day until my gut feels stable enough to eat real food without feeling like I am going to puke). This is ruining my life. A local doctor has and psychiatrist has classified this as anal retention. All medications have failed and made me worse. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks. It is to the point where I can't sit down during the day or I build up too my painful gas in the lower left side of my abdomen and have to urinate constantly to relieve the pressure.

"Dear reader,
My dad(80) has been suffering from indigestion for some months now.
His throat was checked and fine. Perhaps his false teeth are not sharp enough to chew
causing his swallow issues.
Yet his indigestion remains. He reports eating only yogurts and soups.
Or 1/4th of a meal cause he feels full already.
Like as if it doesnt drop to his stomach and the throat is full or just stays in the stomach forever.
So today his stomach result came and there was nothing found, also fine.
Doc said perhaps his medicine is an issue as he's been using 40mg omeprazole for a while now.
I think 20mg was described to him to treat his heartburn and later when he reported indigestion they raised it to 40mg.
But this stomach doc told us some people actually get worse indigestion with omeprazole so she suggested he tried without.
So i did some googling, omeprazole appearently blocks acid production. And now im wondering, how does it treat indigestion by blocking acid, isnt more acid good for faster digestion??? And why does it work wonders for some and bad for others?
What do you think and do you have any tips for him?
Kind regards,
Hodor

"Hello, hope this is the right category, Im not much of a drinker, I might have a few glasses of white wine every two weeks. But when ever I do, the next day I get gas (lasts about 12-24 hours), burps that taste like rotten eggs. A very sulfer type of smell/taste. But I dont get it everytime I drink wine, only about 50% of the time. Im thinking either its the wine itself or what im eating with it, last time I had wine, I had cheese and peanuts, next day I got the burps, If I eat peanuts or cheese but dont drink im okay, it seems to be only when I combine the wine with the food that the problems starts up. Anyone else have this problem with wine? Is there something I can take before hand to prevent it from happening? Or just lay off the peanuts and cheese while on the wine.

"Hello,
I am 24 years old.
I have lower abdominal pain on the right side that started a little over a year ago.
The pain varies in intensity - times there is almost no feeling of pain and times when it is so painful that I am unable to walk or make sharp movements. When the pain attacks (lasting several days), I have to rest in order to get better - if I continue to behave normally and do not rest enough, my condition does not improve. If I press on the area, the pain increases and lasts for longer.
It is important to emphasize that when I do not have the pain I can do sports as usual without symptoms and I have an appetite.
I could not find a pattern of action that avoiding it would lead to the non-appearance of symptoms (e.g. not eating a particular food), but the pain did occur in the past after eating a large amount of food (mostly fried or dairy), after several days of diarrhea (as a result of eating outside for example), after restraint prolonged exhalation of many gases and fece, after training abdominal muscles, during a stressful period, after a massive ascent and descent of stairs.
I will further note that sometimes I have pain in my right testicle (on the same side) with long walk that usually disappears at rest (and for longer as the rest is longer), but even this pain is not permanent (i.e. I can sometimes strain a lot and not hurt at all).
I did a tummy tuck, I did a testicular and groin ultrasound, I did a bowel ultrasound, I did blood tests for chemistry and hematology (including sensitivity to celiac disease), I did a stool test, I did a colonoscopy and I did a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast material.
The results were normal in all tests and not abnormal except:
In the stool test there was calprotectin 65.
Lymphocytes in the blood were slightly above the normal upper extremity.
Small lymph nodes in the lower right abdomen (location of pain).
On CT, they identified an irregularity in the terminal ileum that goes towards the colon, and a suspicion of infection in the small intestine in particular (signs of inflammation).
CT revealed grade 1 spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 secondary to spondylolysis.
In a stool test they identified blastocysts hominis.
On abdominal ultrasound it was found that the appendix was 6 mm (borderline). However, on CT and intestinal ultrasound it looked normal.
On abdominal ultrasound, two polyps measuring 0.3 mm and 0.6 mm were identified in the gallbladder wall. Both have grown over the past six months (from ultrasound to another ultrasound) by 0.3 mm.
Outside the right testicle is a 5 mm acongic focal and adjacent a 6 mm cystic cavity. A urologist examination is not a significant finding.
When I was a teenager, a surgeon sensitively identified that I had a groin hernia and a (small) umbilical hernia, but a recent ultrasound examination found no such finding.
I am really suffering from the pain and right now I have no direction as to what to do to be able to lead a normal and healthy life. I take into account that maybe it is related to something else (a torn tendon maybe? A nerve that stretches in the area?).
I would love guidance and advice on what to do from here and what I should check out, thank you very much.

"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for years. I also have ibs which doesn't help as it makes it worse and have had it since I was 4. Last 4 years it has been pretty awful.
i have been on fluoxetine, however started to be ineffective so they put me on citalopram which did work for my depression and anxiety and is apparently the best for ibs however it did nothing for my ibs.
after seeing specialists, holistic therapists, trying the FODMAP diet and seeing soooooo many doctors for my ibs, my recent doctor has said basically ""sertraline is something you haven't tried for ibs; that could work for your ibs as well as helping the d and a."" I was like yeh do it, let's try everything. 
I was on 40mg citalopram and he told me to reduce it by 10mg a week for a month. Done, however after 3rd day of no citalopram at all, I had all the side effects Iv read on this forum; dizziness, head zaps, electric shocks, anger, extremely emotional etc.
I am a full time worker with quite a full on PA type offic manager job. I'm so scared about starting sertraline after all the side effects Iv read. The side effects Iv had from withdrawal of citalopram have made me pretty dysfunctional this week.
should I take sertraline? Has it helped any ibs suffereres? 
Please can you recommend anything else that I haven't tried that's worked for you? 
I know exercise is meant to help but to be honest I'm so bloated alllllll the time it's so uncomfortable that I don't want to do anything active. Luckily I'm no overweight.
anything you can say I would be so grateful for. Thank you for reading xx

"hi all,
so for nearly 2 years now, I have not felt brilliant and its really affecting my day to day life as it makes me anxious. I have always suffered with mucus, ears always feel clogged, always put it down to hayfever symptoms but this year has been pretty much all year round. I was given dymista nasal spray amd fexofendine last year for a few months and this helped slightly but when i used it this year it made no difference. at the beginning of the year I was very ill and was so worried about myself, after blood tests and endoscopy i was diagnosed with ibs told to take buscopan, i felt better April may and June mainly due to home working through covid-19 but now symptoms have come back, i can't make out if its ears, sinuses or stomach or of its a correlation of everything?
i have been regularly exercising, lots of cycling but still get symptoms, I get really stuffy nose, clogged ears, my stomach gets cramps and bloats.
i am unable to get doctor's appointment at the moment as won't see me.
this afternoon and has happened before, I get really flushed cheeks and feel like i need to make bowel movement, this also causes me to feel light headed, i try not to panic (not sure why i do panic) and this makes it worse.
does sinus issues cause facial flushing? is it just sinuses or a mix of this and IBS?
mucus always seems to be yellowy and rarely clear, just cant shift it, i bring it up and spit out but never feel clear.
I have bought a Fitbit and my heart rate seems normal.
I'd really like to know exactly what is wrong with me if anything to put my mind at rest.
currently i am taking over the counter antihistamine, and beconase nasal spray, and lepicol pro biotic for stomach.
i have cut caffeine out my diet but occasionally have a weekend Cappuccino, also cut alcohol out also and been careful with foods i eat, nothing seems to make much difference

"Hi everyone,
I am terrified about the chronic pain / discomfort under my ribs. It feels like a trapped pocket of air on the left side and sometimes it goes into my back (Left kidney area). It is very uncomfortable when I'm sitting - moving around helps it. Sometimes it feels more like a stitch between side ribs and belly button.
I have also had a change in bowel movements - sometimes loose and constipated at other times (Usually dark in colour). I have lost a little weight and I'm very fatigued.
I have been told that I have IBS and a little diverticulitis.  Could these symptoms be a flare up?  I am worried about my kidney or possibly pancreas.

I have had most blood tests done and everything is normal.

I am considering paying for a scan privately.  Can anyone help?

"3 Weeks ago I had Constipation and had a lot of white mucus and slight blood in the stool and on paper (attached pic) same again the next day albeit hardly any blood.
Click here to view image
I had the harder to pass stools that were like rock pebbles until the following Tuesday when the Doc gave me Laxido which I took for a day (2 sachets) and for the next week and a bit I was fine no issue at all without it.
Last Thursday again Constipation and on the Friday, no blood though but like always a bit more mucus. On the Sat I starting taking smoothies with fruit and veg in to help with the natural laxative. At first I passed harder pellet stall in morning then in afternoon a mountain like stool, the first part was harder then soft as anything but it came out easily. Again in the evening a greener/brown stall that was easy. Yesterday 2 bigger easy stools that were brownie/green but came out easily. Asides my lower back feeling sore I thought i was through it, today though went to go nothing came out then 10 mins later I passed a soft pebble stool but took a second to push and strain then came out easily.
If it was anything serious (tumour etc) would you get the normal stools then strain etc or could it be I'm trying to go to early when its not ready due to the feeling in my back if that makes sense? I did have to take 10mg of Amatripplin before this started for 5 days for neck pain (day before I was first constipated) but doc said this wouldn't be affecting me now.im 37 not over weight diet isn't amazing maybe lacking fibre which is more my worry for anything serious.

"Two weeks ago I began the low fodmap diet per my doctor's orders. I was on a modified diet before (avoiding trigger foods I found) but now I am on the full diet. I was diagnosed with mixed-type IBS.
Because I am cooking low fodmap foods, my boyfriend is eating them as well (only for dinner- he eats his own lunch at work). He generally has an iron stomach and has no history of IBS.
Since I started this diet, we have both been experiencing diarrhea. While this is better for me than the alternative, I would much rather have normal bowel movements. Is there a reason we would both have our stomach messed up?
As an example, dinner last night was a layered enchilada bake, using corn tortillas, lean ground beef cooked with garlic infused olive oil, low fodmap seasoning, salsa, and enchilada sauce, summer squash, and a small amount of cheese. I have been very careful not to cheat.
Thank you for any input!

"ive been diagnosed with ibs-D for a couple years now. im only 21 so im still trying to understand it. because my main issue is with loose bowels ive been taking anti diarrhea supplements like imodium for a while. ive been worried that ive taken them too often however when i bring it up to a doctor they dont seem too worried! im currently waiting for a referal to a gastro specialist (this is the secound time ive been reffered. but in the meantime im not sure what to do!
After i have a flare up i usually take some imodium (more so if im going out somewhere) however sometimes when i take it i am consitpated for a day or 2 but sometimes it doesnt work at all! when im constipated and i finally have to go the pain is really bad i get these horrible cramps and its hard to pass to put nicely ! however once i pass the hard stool it is instantly followed by a loose one sometime diarrhea in the same sitting' im not sure if this is normal for ibs espeically when using medicins like imodium? like i said ive been using imodium for a while as previou medications pescribed by doctors havent worked or have mad it worse! im not sure if this is a cause for concern so i thought i would come here before the doctors as they will most likely tell me to wait for my specialst appointment which could be weeks from now!

"HeLP !GPS Not taking my pain seriously
im 25 male
Ive had chronic lower bowels pain for 8 months now and its getting worse, every morning I wake up in agony/cramps at the very bottom of abdominal, what stays for hours, Ive had about 4 different type of IBS tablets, ive had loads of anti re flux nothing helps, Ive had bloods and stools done three times and all normal, They tell me as I dont have blood or no losing weight and my age, I can not have a endoscopy done on the nhs as there is no warning sign they say, also cause of my age, My aunty had similar pains and went in to a and e one night and was diagnosed with colon cancer 2 days later by scan, even thou shes 40 and no blood in poo and bloods all normal so I know it can happen, This is what worry's me, that I also have colon cancer.
The pain also comes and goes all day long but sometimes its mild other times its cutting
Anyone had any similar pains like this ?

"Hi everyone. I hope you're all keeping well. I have been having a lot of stomach issues for the past 10 years and I am really coming to the end of my tether with it all. I will explain everything below. If anyone has some advice or is currently going through something similar, I would love to hear from you.
Okay, where to start. Since secondary school, I have been having nausea most days. Now, I call it nausea because that's the best way I can explain it. My symptoms are stomach cramps & it's like gas escaping from my stomach without me burping. It is really uncomfortable and gets worse throughout the day. When it was at it's peak, i was working in crawley (about an hours drive from where I live) and when driving home, I would have to keep pulling over to be sick out of the car (gross. Sorry).
My doctors for a long time insisted that it was indigestion. So I have been on omeprazole, lansoprazole and Ranitidine. Recently, I have been taken off those medications as I stopped taking them for a while and didn't feel any different.
I have been on citalopram for around 2 years and do feel like my anxiety is very much present in my life. I am always reluctant to talk about this to the doctor, as they love to blame anxiety on my symptoms. I know it isn't anxiety because it doesn't get worse when I am stressed and I end up feeling sick whether I am stressed or not.
Recently, I have been put of mebeverine, as the doctor seems to think it's IBS. I have been on that for about 2 weeks and it has improved anything.
About a year ago, I had a endoscopy done and they found a hiatus hernia. I was told that they don't do surgery for this anymore because in most cases medication deals with all the symptoms.
I am so tired of feeling like this everyday and it really is effecting my mood. I have my sisters wedding coming up in a few weeks and I know that I won't be able to enjoy the day fully because I will feel ill.
Every time I go out, I know that I will end up feeling ill. Below is a list of things that I have tried for at least 3 weeks.
lansoprazole
omeprazole
Ranitidine
citalopram
Peppermint oil capsules
digestive enzymes
probiotic
prebiotic
ginger tablets
charcoal tablets
The most recent thing that I have talked about with the doctor is increasing my citalopram, because he thinks that it's my anxiety. I don't believe that it is but I am still going to try it. After that, I don't know what else they can do. If anyone has some insite on this I would be forever grateful. As I have said, I really am at the end of my tether with this and it is effecting my mental health dramatically.

"Over the past few weeks i noticed i am having stomach issues. At first i was led to believe it was as a result of IBS as i googled the IBS symptoms. However, in recent day's i now fear that it may be a little more serious and have done some research on Bowel cancer.The only hope i have that it's not bowel cancer is that i am only 20 years of age and bowel cancer usually occurs in older people.
My Symptoms:
Frequent trips to the toiler
Very loose thin stills
NO blood or mucus in stools but sometimes very very dark
Alters between diarrhoea/ Constipation
Extremely Gassy , both by passing gas and burping
Sometimes during the middle of the day feeling fatigue but goes away a short time later
-Sometimes During the night have the feeling of heavy/crampy stomach.
These symptoms don't come and go but instead have been constant in the past few weeks.
Does anyone know what the difference would be with diagnosing IBS vs Cancer ?
Many people will say just go to your doctor, and yes i will but im just here looking for anyone who would have info or has been in the same position as me .
Thanks

"I've been having issues with my stomach for years and have been diagnosed with IBS. I learnt my triggers as to what I can and can't eat as well as lowering a lot of other foods to help maintain a normal gut.
Since having my gallbladder removed my stomach has been all over the place and I want to know if this is normal ...
Last night I worked out that i was suffering with Constipation, kept trying to go with no bowel motion at all. I had some stomach cramping but nothing too bad. Went to sleep, woke up and ended up going to the loo before leaving for work.. although it was hard and had to do a lot of straining. An hour into work I had to go again. Similar but not as much straining. Finally after lunch I.had.to.go and when I mean I had to go I had to run to the loo... I had diarrhoea ... It wasn't completely water, more of a mush but it just came out and since coming home i've been having urges to go (like diarrhoeaurges) but nothing comes out (maybe a tiny bit of wind). My stomach has been cramping and I feel really really rubbish. My stomach is making gurgling noises, the type of noises you get before you have to rush to the loo. All of this is stressing me out and I want to know if anyone has had similar ibs symptoms to this?

"I am a 27 year old (nearly 28 year old) virgin who is Autistic and has severe anxiety. My doctor said that I probably have irritable bowel syndrome, or endometriosis. He said that I don't have ovarian cancer, or any reproductive cancers. I had a transabdominal ultrasound, where they found a very small questionable fibroid, but that was all. I have a severe phobia when it comes to having the transvaginal ultrasound, and so they couldn't do that even though it's supposed to be a better test than the transabdominal.
I experience terrifying symptoms. Pelvic pain, anal/rectal pain and pressure, vulvar pain, tenesmus, a lot of gas, sometimes nausea. There are days where I have a lot of stool, and it feels like I'm never finished with my bowel movements. I often get constipation and sometimes diarrhea. A lot of times I have solid stools that are frequent. I have solid stools multiple times a day sometimes. The feeling of needing to have a bowel movement goes away briefly after I pass a BM, but I still have gas and pain and the small relief doesn't last long.
My pelvic area feels like there's a lot of pain and pressure. It's mostly always my pelvic area that gives me the most trouble, and then if I lie in a certain position with my legs up to my pelvic area, it seems as though the pressure breaks up and then my stomach has obvious gas that moves and is able to be passed.
The feeling in my anal or rectal area is also like a pressure that causes me to clench and strain sometimes. It feels like something is stuck there, or that there's some sort of tension. My vulvar area gets a pressure-like pain sometimes that aches or burns or is difficult to describe.
Lately I've been having vaginal spotting, but only for a day or 2. It usually happens about 2 weeks before my period. For the last few times, it's been brown discharge, though this time it's pinkish-red. It's very alarming for me. I don't know if this is ovulation spotting, or something more serious.
I am overweight, about 190-200 lbs. I have hirsutism (chin hair growth) which I started getting in my early 20s. I have acne as well. I'm worried that I might have PCOS, and that maybe I have endometrial cancer because of it. I'm also worried about ovarian cancer or other reproductive cancers that virgins are capable of getting.
As for the hirsutism, the hair itself doesn't bother me the way it would for a lot of people, so I never regarded it as anything medically concerning until I started getting other symptoms.
When I was younger, during my preteen years, my periods used to be extremely heavy and sometimes would last up to 2 weeks. I remember there were times when I wasn't on my period when I would get pelvic pain that was severe and I would lie on the floor in agony. I'm not sure if this is related to anything that I have going on now. I still get heavy periods often where I have to use the thickest pads, and I have some blood clots usually, though the duration of my periods are about 5-7 days, generally.
Are there any professionals or anyone with expertise or experience who can tell me what might be wrong with me? I'm so afraid. I live with my Mom and she takes me to the doctor, but I don't know what else to do. I'm so terrified that I'm going to die from this. Please help me in any way that you can. Thank you so much.

"hi everyone.
for years now I have been suffering weekly with debilitating bowel problems. Ive had many tests and have been put on many medications (anti-diarrheals, antibiotics, etc) in hope of getting whatever is wrong with under control. i know i do not have Crohns or UC.
However, the past two weeks I have noticed the brown pigment of my stool disappearing more & more and now as of today my bowel movements are nothing but yellow. When I clean myself up it is florescent yellow on the toilet paper and very mucus looking. it's extremely hard to eat. as when I do, my bowels go off immediately and I can spend hours on the toilet while taking Imodium after Imodium that does nothing..the bowel gurgling & swooshing sounds are also very intense.
Anybody suffer from this and if so did you ever get a answer on what exactly could be wrong with you?
Cheers

"Hello,
It seems that twice a week or so that I get diarrhea, and is worse when I have eaten outside of the house. It doesn't seem to matter whether I eat a little or a lot, healthy or unhealthy. It is worth mentioning that at 10 years old I had a twisted bowel, but was fixed within a week with no removal of bowel. The condition also improves when I take 1mg of loperamide (immodium, but unbranded) in the morning - though I still end up going twice a day just normal. Is this IBS or something else?

"Hi everyone,
I'm 37 and a new poster with a problem that hopefully someone may be able to shed some light or least let me know I'm not alone. It's a long post so bear with me.
For about 4 years I have been having issues with my digestive system. It started off with starting a new job and changing my body clock due to an hours change. I found myself being constipated quite often so taking laxatives was quite a common thing for me.
This developed into having trapped wind and bloating or at least the sensation of it located in my upper abdomen so it felt a bit distended and bloated which was/is very uncomfortable nearly all of the time. The symptoms also involved bubbling sensation around my gallbladder area and mirrored on the left side too. I seem to experience some form of acid reflux at least once a week that takes few days to clear. The only time I was/am comfortable was laying down or getting up first thing in the morning and then would develop the further along the morning went on. I believe it is trapped gas at least that is the only explanation I can give for how it feels.
My first visit to the doctors i was prescribed Lansoprazole to which I had a reaction and developed hives. A blood test showed nothing which was a relief but the symptoms have continued.
I put up with this for a few more years and tried different remedies like buscopan, camomile tea, peppermint capsules and oil and changes in diet. I went to the doctors again and once again was prescribed Lansoprazole. I was hoping that maybe it may be different but again the hives came after a week. I am currently on a course of domperidome which I have to take 3 times a day before meals.
I provided a stool sample and after 2 weeks finally got a result of no issues. This made me extremely frustrated as in a way I was hoping that something would be there and I could have a solution or at least a referral to a gastronenterologist.
Occasionally eating will cause the symptoms to subside for a short time but they do return. I gave up smoking for 2 years and the symptoms were still there too. I still suffer with inconsistent toilet patterns or feel like I need to go and nothing but a little nugget and really smelly gas that sometimes has a sickly sweet or very eggy smell. My stool can be very bitty but I also have a glass of water with Fybogel for fiber and it will put it back to normal for a while. I have found myself subconsciously sucking my stomach in as I have put a bit of weight on and don't like the look of myself in mirrors so that probably doesn't help so I am actively trying to look past my body image issues for the sake of this issue.
Again apologies for the lengthy post but its very hard to actually get across how this feels in a way that can be explained. Is this IBS or something else.
Thankyou for your time.

"long story short, there's weird stuff in my poop. i have zero idea what this stuff is and its kinda freaking me out. a few months back i had an incident with some bleeding when wiping, so i went to my local doctor and got the ol' finger test. they said it was likely a hemorrhoid and that i shouldn't worry. over the past month and a half i'd say, however, i've noticed these strange red... things in my stool. these happen rarely and are not every single time i go. its random by the looks of it and has happened about three times over the course of two months. family said it was likely just food such as pepper or tomato skins, but i'd like some form of outside confirmation. most of the time these red things would be buried in the poo but today they were more visible. it looks like these odd red strips, like bits of tape almost. any help with identifying what these are.
some notes:
i weigh around 14ish stone
i vape heavily
i drink a lot of soda
i sometimes suffer from constipation
IBS runs in the family
there was NO BLOOD when wiping this time, apart from some very light bleeding from wiping/dryness (i assume. i've had that for years)

"back in march, i was having diarrhea 5-7 times a day. i thought it was stress & anxiety causing it because i just lost my dad. so i blew it off. but then later that month i noticed certain foods we're making the diarrhea worse. in April, i went to the ER in horrible pain on the left side of my abdomen. they ran my blood work, did ultrasounds, urine culture, swabbed my vagina, etc. everything came back normal & they gave me a referral to a GI doctor.
i have yet to be seen due to COVID-19. in the beginning of July, i had a #2 accident. i couldn't hold it in & after i cleaned myself, etc i noticed pain in my rectum & it i felt alot of pressure even though i couldn't go #2 anymore. an hour passed, i started having diarrhea AGAIN. 10pm-330am it lasted. the last three times i had diarrhea that morning, i had blood when i wiped. i never went it because i know blood in stool can SOMETIMES be normal.
i haven't had blood in my stool or when i wipe since then but i have had diarrhea atleast twice a day.
does this sound like anything???

"So I have a history of mild to moderate acid reflux and I have been told I have IBS.
The last two weeks my dog got really sick and almost died and it caused and very severe amount of stress in my life.
Starting 3 days ago I began having physical symptoms that may or may not be related. It started off as a pressure on my chest (like somebody put a weight there) I also had a good bit of phlegm that I was hacking up (the phlegm has since gone away). I can take a deep breath with no issues and im not feverish. Anytime I would eat or drink anything, sometimes just moving wrong caused a sharp sudden pain in my stomach that would go away as quickly as it came. I can continually re-aggravate it by continuing to move, eat or drink. I was constipated with diarrhea at the same time, but adjusting my diet fixed that but even having a bowel movement did not help this other part.
Anyone had anything like this? I have a Dr appointment on Tuesday, but im trying to self diagnose beforehand (always a good idea) I know its not a heart attack because its been 3 days and im still alive.

"My only symptoms are rectal spasms that prevent a bm from passing...and an overly toned/tight pelvic floor. Was told flat or thin bm is a result of pelvic floor issues leading to the spasm. These symptoms often feel like constipation which leads people to start taking remedies for constipation....then they screw up their digestion.
The therapist that I saw who is an expert in pelvic floor dysfunction said these symptoms are often included in an ibs diagnosis when it might not have anything to do with it! Has anyone experienced this or read A Headache in the Pelvis?
I am so done with these spasms and pain! on antispasmotics, pain killers.
Diet only affects me in terms of what I can past through the rectal area.

"Hi so I may or may not have IBS, I'm waiting on tests at the moment, but my doctor thinks it could be.
I've had a 'flare up' of some kind of gastro problem (which has been put down to acid reflux), which does seem to be going now, however I've been left with a pain in my hips, pelvis and lower back. Feels muscular. Also when I wake up in a morning my hips/buttocks are sore and slightly numb? Does this sound like it could be IBS. I do also have PCOS and suffer with irregular periods, I started a period last week so could it be something to do with that?
Any remedies you could recommend for this would be brilliant, had it around a month now, worried about it at the minute.

"Hi,
Before I get into this just a warning that the image is graphic -
Hoping that someone might have more information into what I'm dealing with.
My stool every 4 days or so has a bunch of these small yellowish white balls (slightly smaller than a pea) that are somewhere in between the consistency of puss and corn. As you can see in the picture there are tons of these balls in my stool (and no I didn't consume corn or chickpeas). Besides the white balls, my stool is pretty normal (I had a lot of green vegetables which is probably why it has a green tint in the picture).
In addition to this the symptoms I'm dealing with (for about 3 months) are:
diarrhea (about every other day)
poor absorption
fatigue throughout day, don't feel refreshed in the morning (about 4 times a week average)
morning headaches (about 1 a week)
I've been adjusting my diet to see if that would help -
Mostly eliminated sugary food, eating less grains and gluten and diary (except yogurt). Some days this I feel like the diet changes have made a difference but other days not so much.
my bowel movements change pretty often. Sometimes I have to go to the bathroom right after eating (seems that the food just moves through my system), sometimes it's really mushy, sometimes normal, etc.

Most of the time after a BM it doesn't seem to go away and I feel like maybe I can't push all the stool out even if it is soft. I went to my doctor and he did a rectal exam and said everything looked normal but there was stool in my rectum and said to try some Miralax. I did and it caused diarrhea but i still have that feeling. I went to an urgent care doctor because I was so concerned and she thought it could be IBS and referred me to GI doctor. She also prescribed me a small dose of Bentyl to try. I am worried sick and can focus on nothing else but this feeling that won't go away and what might be causing it. Wouldn't the diarrhea have cleared everything out? Why do I still feel like this? No pain in abdomen or bleeding.
I suffer from extreme anxiety about health/body things anyway and this is making me a basket case!

"Hi everyone, I have suffered with IBS for years since my early 30's. It seems as though my symptoms do vary a lot each time. I recently lost my husband and thought I had been coping well but then I had a really very bad attack. I had pain and spasms on my left side which has left my tummy feeling feeling sore and tender. I also nearly fainted, which is worrying being on my own now. My appetite has gone and I'm afraid now whatever I do manage to eat will start the symptoms off again. The thing is, that in the past my flare ups have given me diarrhea/constipation but this time I just had the awful tummy pain on the left, feeling shivery and no appetite. and have put it down to stress and grief, a delayed reaction. I did go to my GP back in 2012 and had a scan which was okay and all she did was give me pills for heartburn! I was just wondering if anyone else just gets the pain with no bowel movements sometimes?

"Hello, my name is Deregue, I am 20 years old, and I wanted to talk to people who have already been through this situation, hoping to satisfy some doubts (Sorry for bad English, my first language is Portuguese) ...
Anyway, due to all this Covid-19 thing, I have been having problems with my anxiety, (I was in a good phase of my life, I was managing to deal with anxiety well, however, being quarantined ended up harming me a lot), too I went through a period of terrible eating habits, eating a lot of unhealthy things ... the real problem is: for about a week, I have been feeling nauseous and heartburn (mainly during the night), on Sunday I decided to change my diet, following a menu suggested by health sites, which say they are good choices for those who have gastroesophageal reflux (I've been eating only white meat, fruits like apples, bananas and papayas when I feel hungry, also drinking lots of water)... having said all this I wanted to ask a few questions and observations:
• How long does it take for the diet to start taking effect? I already feel a slight improvement, but I still don't feel 100% (I thought that at this point i would be feeling better)
• My stools are yellow, does this have anything to do with it?
• How long can this heartburn attack last? (I want my normal stomach back!! hahaha)
• I have been having some anxiety attacks (especially when i overthink about this nausea, things like ""i will never get better from this s**t"") sometimes I think it is more a psychological factor than a physical one (since I haven't been vomiting, nor diarrhea ... just nausea and heartburn)
• At the moment I don't want to look for doctors, we are in a difficult period due to the pandemic in my country (I live in Brazil)
Anyway, thank you very much to those who take the time to help a brother ... Peace

"Hello,
I have had IBS issues noticeably for the past five years. Before I was diagnosed, I did have a bad diet and lifestyle that was sedentary and full of stress. My symptoms are constant bloating, gas, thirst, bad skin and brain fog. Paradoxically, two other symptoms are constipation and the need to defecate after eating. Both problems vacillate; if I add fibre to my diet to combat constipation, I become more bloated and gassy, and if I leave out fibre, I become more constipated. The worst part is the bloating and the thirst— the thirst keeps me up most nights, especially with all the urinating (hence the brain fog). I drink a 4.5L minimum of water every day. Here are the actions I have taken thus far:
Blood Tests
Personal Trainer/Fitness/Healthy Diet
Acupuncture
Hydrotherapy
Probiotics
Going Vegan
Going Dairy-Free
Going Gluten-Free
Glucose Hydrogen Breath Test
Herbal Supplements
Kinesiology
Chiropractic Exercises
Food Intolerance Test
Meditation (To combat any residual stress I might still have)
Being More Mindful of my Food Intake
FODMAPS Diet
Seeing a Gastroenterologists
Endoscopy
Colonoscopy
Diuretics
Fasting
Changing Shift Pattern for Work (More sociable hours)
The only time my bloating shrinks down is when I don't eat anything for a few days, but that is not sustainable. Even when I have had hydrotherapy and diuretics, which has cleaned me out empty, I still have some bloating. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what actions to take next? Could it be the flora in my gut or a water build around the stomach?
Thanks.

"I've always struggled in life. About ten years ago I give myself a gee-up and started getting up early. I felt great and the depression lifted.
Then after a few short weeks I began awaking in the middle of the night feeling yucky, digestion rumbling and diarrhoea in the morning. This quickly progressed to a raise in blood pressure, palpitations and massive headaches. The headaches were like the aftermath of walking into a lamppost.
I of course went through the ordeal of seeing different doctors and consultants without any answers.
I thought I may have to do away with myself. I thought what's the point of trying, and began smoking again.
I had been getting up at around 6am, and was slowly returning to sleeping later and later. I eventually realised that sleeping later was diminishing the symptoms.
I began doing research into the circadian rhythm. I saw a sleep specialist at a Newcastle hospital and she diagnosed “DSPD” (delayed sleep phase disorder). She tried me on a course of Melatonin, but there's not a lot they can do.
I've never been a morning person, in fact I dread having to get up early suddenly, I usually go to bed very very late and sleep into the afternoon. In my case getting up early changed my hormone system, initially good but it quickly went into chaos. The Hormone system runs the show, and if it gets out of order!?!

"Ok so here goes not the best conversation but I am 35 years old and for the last 7-8 months I have 1-2 soft stools a day always first thing in the morning I say soft as not very often they are formed stools..if they are they are only small, lately I have been getting diarreah no more than twice a day though. I get no pain at all except from an achy back but no pain.
I went to my doctors who tested me for all sorts a full blood count and a CEA blood test which all came back clear. She has sent me for the camera only to soley put my mind at at rest as a worry like mad over cancer.
She says I will probably have irritable bowel syndrome but the more I read the more I see you get tummy ache with it and I don't have any. I am worried incase I have something else. Can anyone give me more of an insight of IBS

"Hello, this is my first post on, sorry for how long it is!
Okay so. I've always had tummy issues that come and go, diagnosed IBS.
Also have a very extensive mental health history including emetophobia which doesn't help matters as I know some of this could be psychological.
Last August, I started having reflux, which I'd never had before. Was prescribed omeprazole which I didn't take due to my phobia (I know it seems flawed logic, just how my brain is!).
Fast forward to this year, have since moved and changed GP's.
In Feb, I had a routine smear test which came back minor abnormalities, due to repeat in August (not sure if this is relevant).
Abdominal issues are much worse this year. I've always had bad indigestion but I was getting it most of the day, couldn't eat because of such bad nausea and feeling full very quickly. I've lost some weight through to no appetite, nausea or just unable to eat a full meal a lot of evenings.
Sorry TMI but I am often constipated but do have times where it's the other way. Have had a lot of mucuous, stomach cramps, nausea, sometimes even some blood...
I phoned the GP, agreed to take omeprazole which helped the reflux massively, but nothing else.
I'm on the contraceptive pill but periods are more painful despite being lighter and taking me longer to come on during my break. Currently that TOTM and I have a sharp pain on left side which has gotten worse last three months.
I have raised this numerous times with the GP and I think they're sick of the sound of my voice now.
Finally had blood tests last week, all normal.
They won't send me for an ultrasound unless this continues for another couple of months. No other investigations for gastrointestinal symptoms just seem to be expected to accept this is okay. Been told today to take my contraceptive pill back to back to have fewer periods which I said is fine but feel it masks the problem which they said they didn't understand why I was saying that as what they do is treat the symptoms first then make a decision of diagnosis after..?
Anyway I'm so tired of living like this, I really am. Doctors do not believe groin/ovary area pain and gastrointestinal symptoms are linked and have been told it's likely my anxiety exacerbating this. I know I am not making up my symptoms though. Yes I would agree stress etc will make symptoms worse but the fact is I'm still having to experience this and I feel as though the doctors are tired of hearing from me every other week and I'm expected to just carry on, take a pill to stop having as many periods and continue.
Just to add, my tummy has not been examined at any point during this due to COVID restrictions.
What do I do? Where do I go from here? Is this just my life now and I have to be okay with that? Sorry for the long whiney post!

"hi,
I'm a 22 year old male that was recently diagnosed with IBS. I've had GI issues for a few years now, but in the last 5-6 months my stool has changed to a lighter yellow brown color (pictured). it has been like that for awhile now every time I go to the bathroom. I have very bad anxiety and unfortunately my mind always goes to the worst (pancreatic cancer, gallbladder problems, etc). I wish this wasn't the case but unfortunately its how my brain works. I just wanted to see what everyone thought. Is this IBS symptoms or potentially something else?
My symptoms include the previously mentioned light colored stool, gas, constant burping, floating stools every once in awhile, and sometimes diarrhea. additionally, when i wipe it is always yellow.
I have seen the GI doctor and they did blood tests, a fecal calprotectin test, and a CT scan which all came back normal. When I went over the details of my CT scan, it said ""visible pancreas is unremarkable"" ""liver unremarkable"" and ""gallbladder and stomach are slightly distended."" I am unsure of what that means in regards to a diagnosis. The radiologists/doctors said it was normal. Could the CT scan have missed something or is this just IBS symptoms?
I hate what my anxiety does to me and more than anything want to be healthy and happy. Unfortunately, my brain does this. I have been getting mental health counseling for the past month or so and was put on a new antidepressant (i went off my last one before Covid hit which in hindsight was a terrible idea). I also started a gluten-free and low FODMAP diet recently which has lessened gas and burping but it still happens just less frequently. I started taking probiotics a few days ago as well. So i am working on things but am terrified that I have something wrong with my upper GI track that is dangerous. I know I am very young for cancer/anything terrible like that, but I am still scared.
I would love to hear your experiences/thoughts on the matter. Does this seem like IBS to you? What should I do? Is anybody suffering from the same stuff? I'm just so scared ans anxious about it!!

"Hello,
My Mom is having this lower abdominal cramp after bowel movement. for maybe 2 weeks now. if she does not have bowel movement, the cramp won't be there.
She has no diarrhea and no constipation. Although, she is not eating fruits and vegetables because she will get more cramp with those. so without the fruits and vegetables she is slightly constipated.
She was diagnosed with colonic spasm years ago (maybe 20 years ago) with colonoscopy. and since then, it has gone, and now seems to come back.
she also has GERD.
Can anyone relate to this? I just want to gather some information . doctor said she might be chronically constipated even though she has bowel movement daily.
I'm so worried.

"I've been diagnosed with anxiety aggravated .
The doctor said it's NOT food related.
But I can't work out which comes first, the anxiety or the IBS symptoms. I know one feeds the other.
I've tried all the usual IBS treatments, natural treatments, anxiety meds and psychological counseling. I've tried elimination diets and FODMAP eating plan.
I had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy with clear results. I've been treated for helicobacter pylori and last year had my gallbladder removed.
No change. I still have IBS flare-ups. Mainly stomach cramps. Followed by anxiety, followed by IBS symptoms.
I continue to look at my diet and as the symptoms continue I eliminate more and more foods, in case they're the culprit.
I'm no longer anxious that the symptoms could be due to something more serious now that I've had all the tests and told it's 'just' IBS.
But I'm anxious that the symptoms will never leave and that I can't find any relief for them.
I'm really getting very depressed with waking up every morning to pain which last most of the day. Interesting is that anxiety and IBS symptoms usually disappear in the evening and appetite returns.
Reminding myself that I've had this many times before doesnt seem to jolt my mind into seeing reason.
Anyone else have this diagnosis and if so, how do you manage it?

"Hi all,
I feel at the end of my witts; I don't know what to do any more.
I'm 24, female and based in the UK. I have had stomach issues for some time now and have been assessed by two GP's; first one in person and second on the telephone.
I have had several symptoms for some time and diagnosed as having IBS. I don't believe I have this, but I'm unable to convey this to the GP. On the second appointment, the doctor couldn't explain some symptoms and said that I need to make lifestyle changes (which I have already done).
The symptoms I have:
Severe Stomach Ache
Stomach Spasms.
Severe pain after passing stools.
Blood in stool during periods.
Passing blood from anus (feels like urinating blood).
Stomach Gargling.
Hot/Cold Flushes.
Fatigue.
(Maybe unrelated but Sharp stabbing pain every few months under left breast, difficult to breathe at times).
What have I tried:
Mebeverine regularly on several occasions and this has not improved any symptoms.
Peppermint Oil Tablets.
Blood Tests
Anal Examination
Given up dairy (now Vegan)
Tried giving up gluten-free (no difference)
I don't eat any food that could trigger it either.
I'm on Sertraline for (Anxiety and Depression) and Neditol XL (Painful Bladder Syndrome).
I drink approximately 20 units of alcohol per week.
I don't know what to do any more; my GP isn't listening, and I feel I'm at the end of the road; I cannot carry on with this pain any more.
I cannot afford a private consultation and thought this as a last resort. If anyone can help I would highly appreciate it.
Thank you.

"I will be woken up every morning between 6 and 7 needing a bowel movement. It doesn't matter if I slept at 1am last night I will still get woken up.
Initially I will have gas, and nausea. I'll use the toilet and after going a couple of times the nausea will disappear and I'm right as rain. The nausea doesn't wake me up, it usually takes a minute or 2 for my bowels to fire up which is when I start feeling nausea.
Since I quit drinking alcohol it hasn't been as bad. The morning after a few beers would always cause me to use the toilet about 10 times per morning!
But I'm still using the toilet 2 or 3 times a morning to clear my bowels. I wish it would all come out at once lol!
Does anyone else have this problem and any tips t solve it?

"I've suffered with severe IBS for about 11 years now (I'm only 20) and I was wondering if anyone has heard of this or if it even makes sense. When I was about 14 I started getting these horrible episodes that would strike at night when I would lay down to go to sleep. The best way I can describe it is the feeling you get right before you throw up (hot flash, severe nausea, tension in throat and chest) like i'm going to throw up but I don't , and it just keeps happening for hours and hours (usually all night) to the point where I pray I die because the pain is so unbearable. It is also usually accompanied by 4-6 normal ish bowel movements all the sudden and a lot of peeing. It does not happen as often anymore but the only connection I ever could make as to why it happens is constipation. Sometimes when it happens I realize I have not kept track of how many days it's been since I've went to the bathroom and it was probably multiple days without a BM. I feel like this can play into it if stuff is backing up, but my issue is I don't know how to go naturally without laxatives or enemas. I also just have constant chronic nausea in general but when these night attacks happen its actually pain and its by far the worst thing. And I don't know if its reflux because reflux for me is more a burning in my chest and shortness of breath I think

"Hi all,
After going veggie for one month in January, I reverted back to my usual omnivore diet. Since then, I have had constant issues with my stomach, digestion and bowel movements.
It all started with severe constipation, followed by bloating, pains, gurgling, feeling sick, feeling tired constantly, brain fog, unable to concentrate. My GP hasn't been a huge amount of help - after a few appointments, negative blood and stool tests, they have suggested a low FODMAP diet and prescribed liquid Movicol to help with the BMs. With the Movicol, I have one, usually very (sometimes pencil-like) thin, BM each morning, but all the other aforementioned symptoms persist. As soon as I stop the Movicol, I become extremely constipated again, despite drinking around 3 litres of water a day. My
I have been on a strict low FODMAP diet for around 5/6 weeks (completely cut out gluten, milk, wheat, garlic, onion, etc), which hasn't helped symptoms at all. In fact, I feel worse than ever. I constantly feel and look unwell, with big dark circles under my eyes. being a pragmatic person, I have researched extensively and spent God knows how much money on probiotics, magnesium citrate, Fybogel, enzymes, B vitamins, all to no avail. Does this mean it's unlikely I I have IBS?
I have been referred to a dietician but, given the fact that a strict low FODMAP diet hasn't helped, I'm not sure this is the correct course of action? I have always been a very healthy person, I'm a 35 year old male, I exercise most days, eat freshly cooked meals every day, don't eat processed foods, don't drink much alcohol at all, I'm the fittest I've been in years but just feel terrible.
Is it possible that the sudden reintroduction of meat after a month of abstinence has sent my immune system into overdrive and just hasn't got back to normal after 5 months? This could potentially explain the dark circles, low energy, brain fog, etc. Could I have an infection? Could it be SIBO?
I have my initial appointment with the dietician on Monday. Will their first port of call be change of diet? If so, as I've already been on a strict low FODMAP diet for 5/6 weeks, should I push for something different?
Any help would be appreciated.

"Hi all
Im a 27 year old female who never really suffers with stomach problems, only on the odd occasion.
About ten weeks ago, since the UK went into lockdown, i have suffered from low abdominal pain that goes from left to right and ""mushy"" stool, not liquid diarrhoea. I phoned my GP who advised it could be stress induced IBS and told me to take Buscopan. Buscopan did not work so two weeks later i called back and they prescribed me Mebeverine. I am still having ""mushy"" stool (sorry for the graphics!) and intermittent pains either side of my abdomen and sometimes radiating to my back.
It is really stressing me out as I am worried if it isnt IBS and they are just leaving something to fester inside me. Another part of me thinks its weird it started at the beginning of lockdown so it could well be change in routine and stress.
Just looking for a bit of reassurance or advice from other IBS sufferers if it is normal to not have a solid poo for so long. I have also had crampy pains in my bum which is worrying me.
Any help much appreciated

"when pregnant i suffered with constipation and hemorroids. after pregnancy i stopped paying attention to my bowel movements until I recently suffered with them again. they never bleed but made things uncomfortable.
I increased my fibre intake and things got better, sometimes bowel movements where soft but i was just thankful to be going easily.
i started taking a multi vitamin and everything was according to the bristol stool chart 'normal' however i have now stopped taking the multivitamin and things have become very loose again.
At this point in time a bowel movement for me is every other day and starts formed but ends in mush (not water more like thick yoghurt). but sometimes it can be back to all formed. I can not remember what 'normal' for me was anymore as that was pre- pregnancy.
i recently had a blood test for something unrelated and everything came back fine. could i be looking at something like IBS? i have no other symptoms of this.
am i just eating too much fibre?
could this just be my 'normal'?
it is now causing me anxiety everytime i go to the toilet and when making meals i am constantly wondering if something i eat will make it better or worse.

It started with one movement a week would be different to the others, it would start 'normal' i think im done but not.. then it would be skinny, soft/runny until it felt empty - this could take a while but was what i called it my weekly clear out!
Anyway, now this has been my new normal - every time i go to the toilet this happens. I never feel empty as as long i sit there small bit keep coming? its taking half hour to go each time and im always feeling bloated no matter what i do or dont eat . Gas is crazy too - but no pains or cramps .

"Hello All,
I have never thought of looking for a support group until about 1 hour ago. I have been experiencing left side pain and raw feeling in the bowels for several years now. Taking a cocktail of vitamins and mineral has dropped the symptoms by 75 percent. There is still one symptom that haunts me and is getting worse. I'm not sure where to begin to determine if its food related or something more. Below my tail bone i feel rawness and severe inflammation that encompasses the buttocks as well. My doctors say its all in my mind but i think we all know how absurd that diagnosis is. I'm wondering is the foods i am eating are causing inflammation in my stool that feels like i am passing hot peppers when ever i have a bowel movement. The swelling and irritation lasts all day. I am at the point where i don't want to eat any more. My recent bought has been going on for 1 month and finally had to go to emergency at subject myself to a CAT scan. Everything was normal and the nest day and a half the pain was gone. I thought that i in fact was imaging this but soon realized that i had not eaten in a day or so and had no bowel movements. That's why the pain left. As soon as i started to eat and have movements again the pain returned. Its maddening. Not sure what to do now. I not a fan of medications unless no side affects. Can anyone relate to my story? Am i just insane? Thank you to all that reply.

"hello, this is my first time writing on here as I am very worried about this symptom I have been having for about a week. I was diagnosed with health anxiety and IBS 8 months ago and have been dealing with it as best as I can. lately I have had this symptom where I would have gas, then upon going to the toilet there would be this strange yellow liquid from my bottom and on the toilet paper. I would like to mention that my ibs is mostly a mixture of constipation (pebble stools) and loose stools (not diarrhoea ) and I do tend to strain alot. I probably making this sound very complicated but I'm really worried it is something more serious than ibs, like I have damaged my nerves or something like IBD. does anyone know what it could be? thank you!

"I am a male in my middle 20's who has never experienced similar situations before this.
This has started since the start of lock-down. I have noticed a infrequent pain in my lower back and bum spasms every now and again. I have been extremely constipated and noticed white cloudy bits in my stool. I first believed it to be worms and took the necessary mediations for that.
My stool has been very small and have very difficult to produce. My stomach also feels very bloated and makes weird sounds frequently. I have also noticed that it is difficult to get fully erect and when i try i get a pain in the anus almost.
What should i do? Is this IBS?
I have never experienced this before, but feel if it is IBS that it could have been brought on by stress or hpv possibly. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated as this is affecting me greatly.

"This feeling can simply be described as a heavy balloon existing inside my lower right abdomen area. The feeling is internal (not on the skin). It is painless, but is uncomfortable. The feeling always goes away or reduces when I release gas (aka fart), which I seem to be able to sometimes force out if I lay on my side (with the affected area on the bottom, almost touching the couch/bed I'd be laying on).
I've been having these symptoms for 6-8 months. It generally comes and goes, and I can sometimes go weeks without it (most recent break from it was on a trip abroad for an extended time). Lately its become a burden. I've been to my family doctor who has already had me do two ultra sounds, and it was absorbed that I have a fatty liver, and small gallbladder. Otherwise nothing else was detected. My doctor thinks it could be stress-induced or related to my diet, so I've cut off a number of things including: coffee, protein powder, and mixing too many different foods. I don't feel I've seen that great of an improvement. I've also started intermittent fasting to fully just cat everything out to see if it's food related (Fast from 9PM at night until 3PM the next day), but I still get the feeling, normally around the 1PM mark when I fast. When I eat, it's pretty random at when it occurs, but nonetheless seen it happen on an empty stomach or after meals.
What could this be? I'm on the verge of switching doctors to get a different opinion (amongst other reasons pertaining to my doctor). I pushed her for an answer on what the next steps are, and the only thing she could thing of is getting a CT Scan, but she would rather I just ""Wait it out"" and see if it gets worse. I'm generally healthy (Aside from the weekends where I eat more sugary snacks). I exercise 5 times a week. Though I suffer from the occasional insomnia once a week, I generally average 7-9 hours of sleep a night. I'm definitely not feeling the happiest right now in my life, but I'm also not miserable.
Any help is appreciated.
I've attached an image of the affected area.

I'm 43.
15 years ago I had some kind of infection while in India after which I had a short period of acid reflux problems for the first time, followed by a few months of extraordinarily smelly gas. Like abnormally foul.
Soon after that a curious problem appeared. Every time I ate a slightly larger meal than the usual, I got pain just below the ribs on the right side about 1h after eating or perhaps 90 minutes tops. The pain was only mild to moderate but continuing 24 hour per day, lasting 3 - 7 days, after which all went back to normal. It happened rarely later as I got used to eating smaller meals.
9 months ago it happened again and I also had constipation for some time afterwards. About 2 weeks in the pain was almost gone, but then had a slightly too large meal and it increased again.
It's been almost the same since:
Nonstop pain since the end of March, pain level between 2/10 when feeling good up to 4/10 when feeling depressed. Never sharp, never completely absent.
No diarrhoea and only occasional mild constipation
Pain is neither increased nor decreased by either eating or defecating
fodmap diet - a little less gas, but no change in pain
Ultrasound normal, CBC normal, liver enzymes test normal, stool color normal (ranging between light brown and dark brown, but never yellow or black), urine color normal.
Rifaximin improved stool consistency, but no change in pain
Mebeverin (antispasmodic) - no effect
Antidepressants - increased frequency of movements but no or virtually no change in pain
What do you guys think?
Both gastroenterologists thus far have said IBS, which would be fine if the pain was, say, 5 hours per day, but I just can't manage another permanent incurable pain (I'm living with back pain as a result of surgery 10 years ago).
Thanks (and sorry for a long post)

"Hi! I'm hoping someone out there can shed light on what's happening to my body.
When I feel extra ill, my stool, which looks normal, long, soft, brown, has a deep red-brown cloud around it.
At its worse, I am bloated, constipated, cannot feel my hunger hormones, and get dull pains in my belly.
I was diagnosed with IBS at 15. I am a 24 year old, active woman. I am on a vegan + eggs diet and have been since 18. I had an appendectomy at 15, and the issues began soon after.
It began with bloating.
Ive had a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Everything looks fine, though I had a small hemrhoid from the constipation.
Last year, after visits to the ER, a specialist believes I may have Hypothyroidism. My TSH T3 T4 were all in normal ranges, though 2 were on the border.
My heart rhythym is ""abnormally slow"" and I become cold extremely easily, especially my hands and feet.
A flare-up now looks like: migraine, pain/strain behind eyes, fatigue, gas, BRAIN FOG-- very poor short term/ long term memory, slow healing, excessive thirst, lack of hunger hormone stimulations (am i hungry? am i full?), occasional nausea and violent episodes of vomiting without cause, slow digestion.
I notice soy is an irritant in my body.
I also had Rat Lungworm Disease in 2018. I experienced some nerve damage and have sensitive skin.
I workout 3-5 times a week for 30min-2hours. I try to eat a very balanced whole food vegan diet with eggs.
Triggers for a flare up include: alcohol, soy, stress, strong emotions.
I'm currently experiencing fatigue, slow digestion, gas, brain fog, sore eyes and cloudy red/brown stool. I did consume tofu yesterday.
Please let me know what you think-- thank you!!

"I was first dx with ibs a decade ago after full upper gi with small bowel follow through, colonoscopy and biopsy and celiac blood test. I figured out my IBS pattern, did an elimination diet, and had it under control for the most part for many years. mine is alternating but an emphasis on constipation. the usual pain, gas, bloating, need to use washroom frequently, don't always feel like bowels emptied.
since then, I have added the following symptoms or conditions: GERD, canker sores, nose sores, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, GAD, panic disorder, steatorrhea, hemorrhoids, black stool, tingling in extremities, occasional mucus in stool, food avoidance due to fear, constant nausea, weight gain bc I always just feel starving--the only way I can describe it is like I'm drinking water but never sated, but with food. thin dental enamel and receding gums. I have used laxatives and I've had to go home to change clothes bc I didn't make it to the bathroom. I have attributed any additional or worsening GI symptoms to the ibs and then just collected other issues. also I'm short--my mom is too, and I was born preemie--but where it's weird is I have an identical twin who is multiple inches taller bc I was sickly as a kid, constraint headaches (migraines), allergies & asthma, and stomachaches alllll the time so we just assumed that's why.
when I finally got my fibro dx I was dissatisfied because everything ive experienced seems systemic and autoimmune when I finally stepped back. I didn't realize I had the steatorrhea or black stools until I started having different worse gas and new excruciating localized stomach pain, and when I was going down an internet rabbit hole realized that's what my own stools have looked like and maybe I should've gone back to the doctor already. I have a niggling suspicion I have an IBD instead of IBS so that's why I'm posting:
has anyone had such systemic problems with IBS? or symptoms that got progressively worse, and/or changed or added new ones? are all my issues just coincidence?

"Hi I'm a 28 yo male who have been having this issue since 1 year ago.
Last year around the same time i had a minor surgery to remove a small cyst and they gave me clindamycin for 7 days. Around day 3-4 I developed diarrhea and was told to suspend antiobiotics, however no further testing was done. After this incident I've noticed I've been having loose stools (bristol 5-6) almost daily. I notice some bowel movement and grunting during the morning and after foods . However the max amount of times I had to go to bathroom is between 1-2. I must add I've had lactose intolerance almost all my life and that I have to acknowledge my fibre intakes has been very poor for many years. It seems that overeating or eating food dairy in it that can actually produce diarrhea almost immediately so I avoid it. I also use lactase pills to help me digest whenever I know I'm going to eat food with dairy in it like pizza.
Now I don't feel any pain or bloating at all, however I do get some mild amount of gas either as farts or burps and occasionally I feel slight discomfort that goes away on its own. I know I need to go to a GI as soon as I can to be tested for other conditions before but due to lockdown I'm unable to get an appointment unless it is an emergency.
Have anyone heard similar stories? if this sounds like IBS or you think it could be something else undiagnosed? Thanks a lot

"WARNING: GRAPHIC PHOTOS AHEAD
So first, let me just go ahead & apologize in advance for the gross factor- but I've now had this happen a total of 3 times in the last year. I already have appt. scheduled, but it's not for another 3wks. & I'm really stressed out over what this might be caused from..
I have had this show up in the toilet, each time was during a bout of Diarrhea, only one piece of stool looks like this- everything else looks like 'normal' diarrhea. There is no blood in my stools either, but the color of this looks like a red-orange color. I have inspected it & it has a white 'powdery' type of substance in the center. I had this happen once a few months ago, then again last night when I had diarrhea & then again tonight I had diarrhea again & it happened AGAIN. The first time it happened, I thought maybe it was just a piece of food that didn't get fully digested, but now that it's happened again (2 nights in a row) & only happening during a bout of diarrhea, I'm just getting scared & so confused. It doesn't resemble anything I've eaten, so I don't know if this is just what food can look like during part of the digestive process- OR is it a sign of something serious? I have already shown signs of IBS, which is part of the reason for the upcoming appt. in 3 weeks, but none of my research has shown anything like this as a related possibility. I also have Endometriosis, but again, I don't see any correlation there either. Anyone else experience something like this or have ANY IDEA what might cause something like this? Please, any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!!

"I have suffered from IBS for the past 4 years. I can't quite pinpoint exactly when in came on but I had a Wagamamas (Katsu Curry) one evening and the next day around lunctime I had to run to the toilet and had violent diarrhea. Since then I have never had a solid poo. Every morning I have to get up 30 minutes early to sit on the toilet with stomach cramps and soft stools and even after that I still don't feel as though I have gone to the toilet properly.
About 2 years ago I went to the doctors who did stool samples and blood tests. I was then referred to a gastroentorologist who said that I may have post infectious IBS and then referred me to a dietitian who set me up on a Low FODMAP diet. This didn't work.
I have since muddled on with it completely dictating my life and my anxiety levels are going through the roof.
Since a recent bout of severe diahrrea (which come on every so often with no warning or obvious trigger) I have decided to retry am exclusion diet. Since starting it on Thursday 14th May, I have had 2 bouts of diahrrea. One on Friday and one just now (Sunday 11:30pm).
My exclusion diet plan is as follows...
Breakfast: Almond milk, banana, berry and apple smoothie
Lunch: Avocado on rice cake
Dinner (Thursday) Turkey burgers and sweet potato wedges
Dinner (Friday and Saturday) Coconut milk, chicken, sweet potato and rice with green beans.
Dinner (Sunday) - Naan bread with lamb and salad
Snacks: olives/soy yoghurt/gluten dairy and egg free cookies
Drinks: Mineral water
Any idea what (if anything) might be causing my horrendous diharrea? Any advice at all on anything IBS related would be great because its getting to a point where its all getting a bit too much.
Thank you!

"For the past 12 years now I have been dealing with odd symptoms that have always been put down to IBS but in my opinion have never fitted. I've never come across someone else, with or without IBS, who gets the exact same symptoms as I do.
Just a brief bit of context, the following symptoms are sudden and only last for 1-2 hours. After that, apart from physical and mental exhaustion, it goes away as though nothing ever happened. And the frequency at which it happens has been all over the place being anywhere from once a week (at its worst) and twice a year (at its best).
Severe lower abdominal pain, the kind you get when you desperately need the toilet (sometimes wakes me up during the night)
Sudden, watery (and very rancid smelling) diarrhoea
Overwhelming heat - feeling feverish (despite actually having no raised temperature according to a thermometer), pouring with sweat
Feeling dizzy and like I'm going to faint
Feeling nauseous and sometimes throwing up whilst I am still on the toilet
Up until June of last year these were the symptoms I would get every time it happened. The only relief I get is by taking Imodium right as it happens and just waiting it out for 15-20 minutes before it starts to kick in and the diarrhoea and cramping symptoms ease up. However, in June of last year I developed two new symptoms during one of these episodes that landed me in hospital:
Breathing difficulties - I was completely unable to catch my breath
An all over body rash
That day it was put down to anaphylaxis and having an allergic reaction to something which is still to this day unknown.
Since then every 'episode' I have had has included an all-over body rash but I haven't experienced the breathing difficulties since.
I've suffered from PTSD since that hospital trip last year which now makes these 'episodes' so much worse because as soon as I develop the pain I start to panic.
I've seen an immunologist who did no food allergy tests and put my rash down to my use of ibuprofen which I have since stopped taking but am still having symptoms. I'm waiting to see another immunologist who hopefully does more in-depth testing.
I'm at a complete loss for what is wrong with me. My symptoms seem to fit relatively well with something like food poisoning except for the fact that they come on so suddenly and disappear so quickly. It's actually quite scary not knowing what is wrong with my body, and it's getting to the point where I am scared to eat in case I'm consuming something that is doing this to me (which, by the way, I have tried to find out for myself by keeping food diaries but have had no luck pinpointing anything).

"Hi!
I've always been the gut-anxiety type of person, having loose stools whenever I'm under a lot of stress. A bit over two weeks ago, though, I started having this more regularly, every day I have diarrhoea (but just once or twice a day which is normal for me but the consistency is not). At first I didn't think much of it because I'm having some very important exams these days but now it's been going on for almost three weeks. I'm lactose intolerant and in the past week I cut off any caffeine from my diet, started taking probiotics but nothing seems to help. I also have mild bloating and abdominal discomfort due to that, plus sometimes very loud stomach gurgling after I eat. I have other stress-related symptoms, too, such as poor nights of sleep and constant anxiety but this one thing is new and freaks me out a lot.
I have health anxiety and whenever I try to find solutions or tips for my problem online, the only thing I seem to find is colon cancer. I'm getting really worried and because of the pandemic I can't really get myself checked.
Please help! Is it possible to have bowel cancer at my age? And if it's ""just"" IBS how could I make my symptoms go away?

I'm 35 years old female and just wanted to know if what I am feeling is typical of IBS.
For the last week I have had nausea most day, with lots of gas both burping and flatulence. My stools vary in consistency most days, from normal to looser. I also suffer with the feeling of incomplete bowel movement. Symptoms seems worse when on my period. (TMI)
Can you recommend anything for the nausea?
Is it normal to be given a diagnosis without any further tests like colonoscopy?

"Hello all,
I am hoping someone can shed some light on my somewhat “unique” situation. I’m a 38yo male and live in NJ- USA. I’ve had bowel issues for quite some time-the primary constipation.
.
About 3 years ago, a Dr. suggested an antidepressant, so I started Lexapro. I didn’t “love” how I felt mentally and experimented throughout the time, but always resorted back to Lexapro.
During this quarantine things exasperated so, I used the downtime to experiment.
I discovered, though Lexapro does help my constipation, it certainly does nothing for my mood or cramping and bloating. I’m not sure if the Lexapro is causing/worsening the cramps and bloating (since I’ve always had them) or if the symptoms are just part of my pre-existing problem and Lexapro is not helping or worsening them- it’s just not enough to control it all.
I recently experimented with Prozac first 20mg and then 10mg (20 was too much for me). I discovered the Prozac helps my mood (a lot) and it controls the cramping bloating, etc. the downfall is that it worsens my constipation, even when I take laxatives, I find myself constipated.
My standard regimen for years has been to take a laxative at night so that in the morning I go to the bathroom. Taking it at night also helps avoid side effects during the day- I often end up waking up throughout the night to go to the bathroom which I have grown accustomed to. Furthermore I’ve always taken my Lexapro in the morning along with my daily vitamins etc.
Since they both have pros and cons I don’t know what to do.
My thought was to reduce the Lexapro from 10mg to 5 and take it with my laxative before bed (since it helps my regularity and does cause some drowsiness) and then take 5mg of Prozac in the AM since it helps with my mood and TREMENDOUSLY helps control my GI issues. I have not tried it yet as I’m afraid to over-do it.
I am awaiting a call back from my doctor but I figured I’d get some other opinions in the meantime.
Any thoughts are much appreciated as I’m pretty desperate for answers at this point.
Albert

"Hello......I don’t know If i am even in the right place to ask here.For the past few months I have had in half of times thinner stool. Not in one piece, but a few smaller/thinner pieces. Sometimes my abdomen has been hurting but much less these days. I wanted to ask if this can be related to the fact that my I have been facing with lower pain back for the past few months and some stress on top of that. I usually go to the toilet everday sometimes once in a two days. I have no blood in stool no sputum. I have normal taste. My weight did not change. I am not feeling tired or sleepy. Sometimes my limbs are just a bit tired but that could probably be linked to something else. Should I go see doctor or what could this be? The colour is normal aswell. I have visited doctor with the abdomen pain and they even made x-ray of my entire belly and found nothing. Should I be concerned? Sorry if this a wrong group.

"Hi all,
I'm 23, vegan, exercise a lot, rarely drink alcohol, don't smoke, drink lots of water, and generally lead a healthy life. I've had hemorrhoids for a while (talking like 2 years+!) and had these checked by the doctor who said they will just go by themselves. They haven't! I've tried various ointments, and increasing water and fibre intake and if anything they seem to be worse. I'm starting to think they'll never go and I'm also really embarrassed at having them at a young age and anxious about my long-term boyfriend seeing down there. Alongside this I also experience constant bloating and this is strangely worse after a bowel movement. This goes against what I read about IBS where a bowel movement is meant to relieve the bloat. Does anyone else have this?
I want to go to the gp about it but I also know I have health anxiety and don't want to burden the doctor with it if it's just anxiety (esp during the coronavirus pandemic), but I'm really sick of having all these digestive issues.
Should I bother with the gp? Is there anything I can do to relieve symptoms?

however over the last year, whenever I get an ibs-D flare up I feel exhausted for a good day or more after. like really wiped out.
things have been bad over the last month and terrible over the last few days. anything I eat results in severe pain and a dash to the toilet 30min later. I can't keep anything in at all.

"Hi everyone,
From a year now I've had some uncomfortable bowel habits that have come and gone. I'm 35 and before this never had any issues.
It all started last April 2019 when after having my son I suffered from a massive panic and anxiety episode. I went to the doctors and they blamed all my symptoms on my anxiety, but did some tests to make me happy. They were all negative. One doctor did mention IBS but that was it.
That April I was getting stomach pain, followed by diarrhea then constipation and mucus in my stool. This latest till June.
It went away for a few months then had another attack in November 2019 when I had horrible stomach pain, again with changing stools.
I have now entered another anxiety episode (because of being isolated) and my stools have gone thin and I have had mucus as well when passing gas. No stomach pain but feel like i need to go when I've just been.
Do you think this sounds like IBS? I am reluctant to contact the GP as they just blame may anxiety for everything. I was going to see a specialist but now everything has shut due to coronavirus.
Any thoughts would be welcome.
Thanks in advance.

"Hi All
I've been diagnosed with IBS-A for some time now, I've also been diagnosed with internal hemorrhoids following a colonoscopy about a year ago, which was looking for signs of Ulcerative Colitis and/or Crohns Disease, neither of which were found even with biopsies taken. My bowel movements are usually ok, or I mainly experience constipation when IBS flares up. With this I sometimes pass bright red blood after the bowel movement, which I have been told is a result of my hemorrhoids. Every now and again I get IBS-D flare ups that lead to a very urgent feeling of needing to go to the toilet and end up having very loose bowel movements. I have never bled while having one of these IBS-D flare ups, however they leave me feeling extremely sick and generally unwell for a good day or two after experiencing one of them.
This morning I had an IBS-D flare up, which started with intense and extreme gurgling and churning all around my lower abdomen, which then led to a sudden urge to go to the toilet. My bowel movement was a rather explosive event and was very loose, but did not notice any blood on or in the stools or in the toilet bowl. However, when I started to clean up I noticed on the toilet paper that there seemed to be quite a lot of red blood mixed with mucus. After cleaning up there was no sign of any continuing bleeding.
I'm just a bit worried as I've never experienced bleeding with my IBS-D flare up before, and it has been a bad enough flare up to make me feel really quite unwell for most of the day, although I have improved slightly as the day has gone on. I'm pretty sure it is just a internal hemorrhoid burst but I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced internal hemorrhoid bleeding with an IBS-D flare up?
I'd be extremely grateful to hear your thoughts and views on this.

"Hi Ladies-
I have been having some bothersome symptoms. I have had IBS for years and admittedly it has changed drastically over the last couple of years. There is always a plethora of new symptoms every few months that makes me worry until I can get it checked out. About 6 months ago, I started having pelvic bloating that has never really gone away. In fact, it seems to have gotten a bit worse. Two to three months ago, my GERD started getting out of control with belching, gas, and abdominal bloating. The last few days has been really uncomfortable with the bloating and discomfort in both abdominal and pelvic area (mostly both on the left side). I've been taking licorice root and peppermint, and Prilosec for at least a few weeks. The Prilosec has helped some, but not much. I feel less bloated after a BM, but it's still always there. It's that feeling you get when your pelvis feels like it's jutting out when you're standing up and it hurts the small of your back. I had a pelvic ultrasound in September that showed a small cyst on my right ovary, but nothing else. Just had another one today. How many of you ladies out there have had symptoms in your pelvis that ended of being IBS?

I see a GI next Tuesday but until then I’m not sure what I need to do!:( I’m also 23 I’ve been super healthy up until September of last year. I used to have nausea, acid reflux, vomiting, and fullness in the past 6 months as well.

"Hi all,
Just before last Christmas I decided to go on a Vegan diet, plant based diet, I was already vegetarian anyway, so no chess, milk, fish, I basically started eating foods which I had considered problematic, Beans etc, I started with small amounts, over three months later I'm eating a wider range of foods Rice,beans, Quinoa, Buckwheat pasta, lentil pasta, onions, chia seeds,Walnuts, and more, etc, I have plant based milk, rice or oat milk, anyway the result of all this, no more bloating, no constipation, bowel function much better, feel better, more energy, the reason I went Vegan plant based diet was because I didn't want to complicit in the suffering of farmed Animals, Animals in general and the fishing industry.

"Hi all,
I have ulcerative colitis and have been experiencing pretty bad symptoms over the last year and a half.
My NHS gastroenterologist has run a calprotectin test several times but as the figures come back borderline or low, she says its just IBS and there is nothing she can do.
Can anyone recommend any private IBS clinics in the London area? I want to get my gut flora testes etc.
Many thanks,

"Anyone know if Liquid Gaviscon Advance is suitable for a low fod map diet? I was using the older Gaviscon (which was recommended here) but it's being phased out and being replaced with a new Advanced version, and I am struggling to see if it is Fodmap safe.

"I have stomach Ulcers that is coming from somewhere. I have been on Lanzoprazole for 3 months Lancap for a year and still comes back, Before all of that started I had an issue where it felt that my right leg had a muscle cramp, felt as a warm feeling of a worm creeping inside my leg. That ended the day afterwards, But I am still struggling with an issue that just doesn't want to go away. My left thighs muscles keeps pulling and I keep having a burning and painful feeling in my left side and it gives me a painful headache as though something is ripping through my skull. I cant sit, and my groin keeps moving as though something is causing a uti infection. I have been to the doctors many times and all they did was give me ulcer pills. I demanded a catscan from them from my neck down to my lower back. the pain is still there. I don't know what to do anymore. The doctors keep eating my money and doesn't get the problem solved. I am seriously in bad shape.

"After my IBS started getting worse and unpredictable and I had an endoscopy. I never thought my digestive distress was stomach related. No pain, indigestion or heartburn. Just constant bathroom issues every morning, gas and sporadic lower GI pain. It always seemed intestinal so who would ever suspect an upper GI problem. When I woke up after the procedure my doctor said I had a lot of redness in my stomach. She put me on Protonix (acid blocker) and about 3 weeks later I am a new woman!
My years of lattes, OJ, wine etc. apparently caught up with me. Had I known I had an acid problem I would have been reduced the acid and popped OTC acid blockers and prevented years of distress. I wish my doctor had mentioned gastritis causes IBS.
Apparently all of that acid pours into your stomach and GI tract and viola, you are suffering the effects. I am still afraid to drink alcohol because even on the meds, it kills me the next day. So does ginger ale. I always drank it because I thought it was making me feel better but i was so ill from it the next morning.
I have also given up gluten a but since I don't have Celiac, I'm bringing it back. Reducing it does help prevent bloating and gas but it is really hard to live without.
The lesson I learned is listen to your body and search for a treatment rather than chalking it up to IBS. Don't write things off as stress. What causes stress is having horrible GI symptoms.

"For the past 4 months i have been having these symptoms:
1-Excesive ammounts of flatulence (HUGE ammounts)(foul smelling like rotten eggs), inmediatly after i wake up and even during sleeping time, this lasts up until 2 hours after i wake up (usually), then i have my lunch,then the flatulence goes away for the most part (sometimes i do have it here and there, but not as bad), then during the day i eat at like 5pm (tea and cookies),still nothing happens, then it comes back at night at around 8pm before i have my dinner., and i keep having flatulence non stop, and its not even a small ammount, its a LOT, one after the other, which is getting me worried.
2-A SINGLE diarrhea poop like once a week(big one) when im done pooping it, then its gone for the rest of the day, other days my stools are usually either soft, normal, or im slightly constipated
3-Big ammount of mucus in stools
The weird part is i dont have much pain, sometimes i feel like my intestine is inflamed or i feel a slight pain but nothing big, my biggest symptom is gas and soft stools with lots of mucus, sometimes the one time big diarrhea...
could this be stress? ibs? or something more? ..

"I was talking to a friend about this and she said that perhaps I have IBS which never actually occurred to me.
So it's a bit gross but it has got me wondering.  If I eat particularly fatty foods (especially if I've been on a low fat diet for a while) or if I eat too much, I sometimes get such bad stomach cramps and need the loo.  I will go and it will start off normal (sorry I don't want to get too graphic) but then go into diarrhoea and sometimes I have what seems like almost a clear fatty discharge.  Sometimes the stomach ache will continue for a shortwhile after.  
It made me just think that my body doesn't cope with digesting fat too well but, for instance, if I have a doner kebab (I know, most people think these are disgusting but I do absolutely love them - but don't have them often), I will go through this.  Really bad stomach aches, passing wind and then I'll have a serious need to go to the toilet which will sometimes pass but it'll always come back until I go.
Do you think this could be IBS?  I only ever get it when I eat particulalry fatty foods - which is why I often avoid them - or is it just a simple case of certain things not agreeing with me?

"My story starts 7 years ago when i had a colonoscopy in january 2017 due to frequent diahrrea. I was 20. Neither me or my GI doctor were even considering colon cancer but he did a colonoscopy and it came up clean according to him. Then, a couple months later, a general surgeon from the same hospital who i was seeing for a seperate reason brought up the colonoscopy saying that I had polyps? I dont remember much else of that conversation, so he must not have emphasized any real concern about them. I just forgot about it.
Throughout the years since then, I continued to have bowel issues like diahrrea and for the last 2-3 years at least ive noticed thin and usually flat broken up stools, often loose in consistency. I forced myself not to worry too much and just figured it was probably due to my heavy drinking problem. However, one morning a couple weeks ago i woke up and strained to push out a pencil thin stool very light in color. At that point i decided to look up my symptoms and freaked out when i realized a lot of my symptoms matched colorectal cancer symptoms. I decided to stop drinking and on the third day of not drinking i pushed out a dense, rather thin stool that was coated in blood. I could see blood in the toilet water. At this point i diagnosed myself with cancer. Not having insurance i rushed to a community health center walk in clinic. The doctor gave me reassurance and said most likely hemorroids and prescribed a fiber supplement. I decided to take metamucil wich definitely made my stool significantly thicker but still misshapen and concave. The doctor i saw for my follow up appoint was much less reassuring so i got state insurance and am in the process of scheduling a new colonoscopy. I requested a copy of the report of my previous colonoscopy and it makes no mention of polyps. In fact it states that everything looked normal and no polyps were noted. So why did the other doctor say i had some? im so confused and worried that something that could have been avoided is now haunting me. i feel like im screwed. im worried sick and cant sleep. help

"Last week I was a bit constipated before my period. I felt a sharp pain when going to the bathroom and saw some blood after wiping. I didn't think much of it and everything was fine till 2 days later when I had quite a bit more blood/some pain after going to the bathroom (but no constipation since the 2 days prior).
Then I started my period earlier this week and dealt with lots of diarrhea the day before starting and the first day, which I attributed to IBS. But when I went to pee on the first morning and there was so much blood the water was pink. I've never had this before and was nervous but attributed it to being particularly hydrated (clear urine) and having a heavy flow... But then today (day 5) I have diarrhea again and today, and several times throughout my period regardless of medium/heavy days, I've been getting stomach discomfort/cramps and notice blood in the toilet- instead of just on the TP- when I go to the bathroom regardless of if I just pee or not.
I'm trying not to worry, but it's very odd for me to see so much blood in the toilet bowl. I was recently laid off and don't have insurance any more so I know I'm under more stress than usual, but that also means I can't go to the doctor.
I guess I'm just wondering if others see blood in the toilet even on medium days; should I be particularly on ""edge"" about the amount of blood the first night...?
This doesn't seem ""normal"" for me, but nothing does with IBS. . .

"I have been pooping yellow stool for a month now from 14th of December until tonight (13th of January)... It has been a mixed of soft solid, and soft served (ice cream) consistency. It has been on dark yellow to golden yellow. Never light yellow. It was only one time where I pooped a normal regular brown poop Also, for a month, most of my poop has been undigested food. I have been primarily eating rice, spinach, and long bread. And I always drink water and rarely any carbonated drinks or soda. Although, I have drank 3 shots of vodka on the 31st of December. And on 11th of January I had drank a normal glass of cocktail (Rockstar and rhum).
A few background. On the first week of December, I was taking Amoxicilin with paracetamol for a week because my molars got infected. Then, from 21st of December until January 5th, I was taking Doxycycline since I had an STD scare. I did not take anymore medicine from that night onwards except for vitamin c supplements. Is this normal for me to have yellow poop and undigested food as a side effect of the antibiotics or should I have it checked?

"Hi everyone,
So I've got IBS and have now got the dreaded stomach bug. Woke up on Wednesday morning and had sickness and diarrhea, and all i ate all day was two crackers. Yesterday (Thursday) I wasn't being sick but had bad diarrhea all day long. I started to eat, and had 2 boiled eggs for breakfast, some marmite on toast for lunch, and then scrambled egg and some plain chicken for dinner. Today is the 3rd day (Friday) and I woke up at 5 am with dirarrhea, and have had another bout just now (8am) so it obviously is not showing signs of letting up. I have been drinking lemonade (but adding sugar to get rid of the fizz) and water.
Is it normal for it to last for 3 days like this, with bad diarrhea? And am I doing the right thing in eating? I feel hungry and am also concerned about losing weight as I am already borderline underweight.
I really hope it clears up soon as have missed 2 days of work this week and am worried that it might not have stopped by Monday when I have to go back to work.
I appreciate any advice anyone can give me.
(I also suffer from anxiety - particularly about my ibs - so I feel that will make matters worse).
I always come on here for advice when I'm worried, and find everyone really helpful.
Thanks

"Is all this pressure I'm feeling really just IBS? I have constant pressure in my stomach that radiates to my back and causes pain. But, if I rub my back I burp and I feel better for a few moments or if I pass gas I'll feel better for a little while but the pain is Intense. it'll go away if I don't eat but soon as I do eat something it's a right back. I can't believe all of this bloating and gas is just IBS, is this what it feels? I have constant burping, stuffed feeling, mid and lower back pain that come and goes (better with bowel movement, passing gas, or burping), constipation, and diarrhea. Are these the symptoms? Does anybody else feel the same type of pressure in their abdomen? I like to add, sometimes the pain is so intense I consider going to the hospital but then feels silly like who goes to the hospital for IBS? Other times it tiggers my anxiety because I'm getting nervous that there's something else wrong with me. I have this pain before I got my gallbladder removed and and thought it would go away and it didn't. I'm so over this I just want to feel better. If anyone can relate, has any helpful tips, or at least share some of the same symptoms I look forward to your reply. I truly need the support.

"Im male,33.
3 years ago I had anxiety issues again and I would wake up early, feeling my jaw clinched (which is stress) and after a couple of months I was on a party. I ate and had half a beer, went home and I was heavily nauseated because of an intense indigestion.
1 month later I was on anti inflammation drugs and Muscle relaxants for my back(15 days).And I had a couple minor indigestion occasions where chocolate was the irritant.
Had another indigestion after I ate an apple after breakfast where I decided to see a doctor.
The doctor had me on ultra sound for liver kidneys stomach bowels .Blood tests ,hernia checks nd endoscopy. All clean.Everything seemed normal so she went with IBS and anxiety.
Gave me librax for 10 days but the symptoms of bloating ,indigestion,shivers ,increased heart rate , did not go away.
After I stopped Librax I had insomnia where I would wake up in the morning at 4:30 and I had increased heart rate and muscle spasms.Constipation lasted for 3-4 days.
I went to a therapist and I fixed a lot of issues I had and I have to say I rarely get mild anxiety now but insomnia persists when I eat foods from a long list. Basically I can eat chicken,grapes ,past with low fat cheese, low fat fish.
Most foods take 5 hours to digest and even when the bloating goes away, I wake up in the middle of the night with increased heart rate and Im unable to fall asleep again. Im constipated the other day.
I have a light case hemorrhoids that rarely bothers me, if at all.
Lately I ve doing great but sometimes if I try to eat a bit more or something of my list I get symptoms again. I know its going to take more time but its been 3 years already... Wish me luck good people.

"my doctor has tried me on several different anti-diarrhea medications that have stopped working after a couple of months. My diarrhea has been so bad that I can go over 20 times a day. They now have subscribed me Loperamide, prescription immodium. I take 8 pills a day which does always work. They said to take PeptoBismol tablets if necessary, up to 4 a day. Between all the meds it has slowed the diarrhea done to about 10 times a day.
My biggest issue is the pain and gurgling. I'm always in pain no matter what I eat or drink. The gurgling is so loud that if I leave my house others can hear my stomach. Doctors can explain the pain or the gurgling. Recently when I have a BM, it is a darker brown with a lot of yellow cream colored mucus that is very thick. Contacted doctor about that but still no response.
If anyone has had this or has any suggestions of how to relieve it I would appreciate the advice.

"Hi everyone
So almost 3 weeks ago to the day, when I was a little hungover from new year celebrations, following day I went for a walk along the beach and came over a little funny, legs arms felt like jelly needed toilet for bowel movement. I put it down to hangover and/or bug but have also suffered ears sinuses issues so figured it was either of those! 24 hours passed and still felt crap, really constipated, weak arms legs no energy. After 3 days I finally consulted a doctor as symptoms were still the same.
The doctor checked me over, ears, stomach, breathing, blood pressure, temperature etc. He concluded I'd suffered a stomach virus and possibly mild ear infection which were causing my symptoms . He prescribed me omeprazole gastro tablets x 56 (2 x daily) and to take gaviscon, ive now taken 30 to date.
My symptoms don't seem to be any worse but I do get really bloated and abdominal fullness, gas, after eating main evening meal, lunchtime not so bad and seem ok after breakfast.. I have changed my diet considerably since this health scare eating plain cod or salmon fillets jacket potato or rice, green beans, spinach. Ive cut out meat, broccoli, no caffeine or alcohol for 3 weeks and drinking fennel or peppermint teas.
Could this simply be a case of IBS, side effects of omeprazole causing the above? Ive read ibs and omeprazole can cause fatigue as well as abdominal pain, bloating. I did manage steady 40min bike ride at gym last night and have been doing 1.5 to 2 mile lunchtime brisk walks on my work breaks. I'm not sure whether to stop taking the omeprazole to see if I improve?
Before xmas i did experience bloated tummy on certain days and noisy tummy after eating so I'm thinking IBS is the issue as I did indulge a bit over xmas, beer food etc which could I guess have triggered it.

"Alright. I'll keep this as brief as possible because I know there are a lot of these posts out there. I'm diagnosed with anxiety. Doctor has told me forever my GI issues are just IBS due to anxiety. So much so, they did an abdominal CT scan with contrast in December of 2017 just to prove to me I was fine. It was all normal, however I did have a small umbilical hernia containing fat. Blood work has all been normal for the past couple years. I have pretty much just ignored (or at least tried) my GI symptoms for as long as possible.
Recently, about 2-3 months ago I realized a painful dull pressure under my belt as I sat at my desk on the lower right side. It's different than anything I've felt up until now. I have gained some weight so chalked it up to my belt being a little tight and causing discomfort/pressure as a result. Ever since that pain has remained. Every day at work consistent pressure/dull ache on the lower right side under my belt as I sit at my desk. When I get home and get in more comfortable clothes it settles down some, but I still feel this pressure. Sometimes sharp around my navel, but mostly localized to around where my belt sits. I do feel something in my fat layer that feels like a lymph node or something but it's a mobile round jellybean like mass.
Anyway, I went to doctor 2 weeks ago and after a physical exam was reassured there is no lump or physical palpable mass or abnormality that she was concerned with... she didn't even feel the lymph node like bump I was mentioning. Nonetheless, she ordered an abdominal ultrasound for peace of mind.
That happens Friday. Long short, I'm incredibly nervous. I always have wacky bowel habits... no blood or anything, but diarrhea is a fairly normal occurrence.
I have a 5 month old daughter and I'm 30 and I just can't imagine being diagnosed with something sinister... but nothing I find online describes my symptoms. I don't think it's a hernia, or appendicitis or IBD... but I feel it's something.
I read colon cancer doesn't typically cause pain unless it's far along, but I'm 30 and I don't have a family history... I really just hope that's not it.
Can IBS really just sit in one location (lower right quadrant) for months on end without letting up?
If it's all clear at ultrasound Friday then what?
I can't even think about anything else. I pretty much slept all weekend because sleeping is pretty much the only time I don't feel it.
It doesn't really hurt it just feels like constant pressure. Sometimes it hurts and sometimes it radiates to my navel, but again, typically just unrelenting dull pressure.
Anyone dealt with this? What was it?

"Hi all,
This past week I've been having normal bowel movements compared to other weeks where I was either constipated or had diarrhoea (I do believe i suffer from IBS). However, the last 3 days I've had discomfort / tenderness in the lower left abdominal area.
The last week my diet has been poor, from nearly having takeaway (KFC & McDonalds) every night to processed foods such M&Ms, chips, BBQs, you name it.
Today I passed 2 bowel movements, both dark brown in colour with undigested food found in my stools that were black in colour. They were mostly stringy, looked like fruit skin. But they were grouped together in chunks in my brown stool.
I’ve been able to pass gas, produce stools and still eating regularly without any pain or discomfort.
Is this something to be concerned about? Is it blood? Has anyone experienced this before?
I have flagged this with my GP back in December when this happened once before. I am going in for a colonoscopy and endoscopy next week. I don’t have anaemia as my blood results came back normal.

Sitting is the worst but being up and about is not too bad. With it being Christmas it's been difficult to get an appointment with the doctors but tomorrow I'm going to insist in being seen. I just haven't experienced it so bad this time and my gut health has been troublesome with IBS and even with clean eating I still seem to suffer.

"As the title says - not long ago I was diagnosed with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). I have been going through quite a lot of stress, and IBS has became a bit of a problem.
I know that the best advice is to eliminate stress. But this is of course hard to do (work, univeristy, relationships etc) I am generally a rather paranoid person (but I have been better recently!)
I guess my question is: how many of you suffer from it? As far as I can tell from research I did it is quite common nowadays. So I wondered whether there is some dietary advice you could give me, or maybe types of excercise, or really just any other kind of advice would be appreciated! Maybe some stories from people who managed to beat it? Thank you very much in advance!

"I've been trying to go non dairy for 2 weeks now, but I feel like im suffering more often because of it, most likely from withdrawal symptoms or not getting enough of the vital vitamins.
My current diet is just apple sauce, oreo's, Original pringles, spaghetti, gobstoppers, (water now for 2 days) was ice tea.
Reason for all of this is most likely IBS, as i believe the Gastroenterologist said i might have awhile back, had a colonoscopy and a Upper endoscopy but the doctor only said my throat and colon were just a bit red, and nothing else from what i recall(which was probably from the miralax needed to be taken for the tests), its been some time and i do not have insurance to visit another doctor, for a more updated result.
Currently on Dec 23rd i started having cramps and diarrhea and next day i felt better, till later that day i sneezed and got really sick runny nose and felt like I had a fever, next day still had the ""fever"" but the cramping and diarrhea came back and been having the cramping and diarrhea still with a more mild forehead burning to this exact moment.(also a need to urinate very often not from drinking a lot of water as was doing it before i started drinking bottles of water)
My main question is, will it be best to ignore all dairy and add supplements or other food options to get the other necessary vitamins or will using Almond milk allow me to still eat some past dairy items like mac and cheese, fettuccine Alfredo with tuna? As with these dairy foods i did not feel any discomfort after taking a bite or eating, cept the feel after eating and being full that i would probably need to go to the bathroom, unlike drinking chocolate milk/milkshakes, ice cream, pudding, where after a bite/sip i would start feeling something in my stomach and would need to go to the bathroom soon, but not sure if its just not as bad as those drinks/food but still bad and contribute to the cramps i would often get, i know mac and cheese and the fettuccine alfredo have the packet of cheese/seasonings so idk if even replacing the milk with almond milk would make them fine with those packets still, if replacing milk with almond milk is a perfect was to still have ""dairy"" for IBS people.

Been having symptoms for 18.months and not really got any answers.
I'm 44, female, 64kg, 5 ft 8, active, healthy and a bit of a worrier.
Started with heartburn and left sided upper abdo pain, GP said GERD, gave me lanzo and omeprazole, didn't do anything. I was super stressed at work. She said it was related. Started getting occassional yellowish stools and looser stools periodically. Went back to GP. Told stress related, had a bunch of bloods, all normal except a bit anaemic (heavy periods). Went back again recently and had more bloods, all normal except highish cholesterol and an ultrasound for my gallbladder. All clear. Now, a month on I have loose yellowy stools again and all over abdo cramps including upper left under ribs and up into chest.
No weight loss or other worrying symptoms. Any ideas? IbS? If I go back to GP not sure what else she will do? Oh I quit my stressy job and got a new better one!

"I was diagnosed with IBS about 8 years ago, and the past two days I've been having symptoms which I honestly don't know if they're a bug or not.
I ate some really spicy food a couple days ago, which at worst can give me a few stomach cramps, but yesterday I woke up with cramps, gas and bloating. I managed to get through the day (not eating much mind), but at night had a bout of diarrhoea after eating. It was sudden, and while it wasn't liquid it wasn't solid either. I took some Imodium as I was tired and didn't want to be awake all night. Today my stomach has been churning non-stop and I keep feeling the need to have diarrhoea but not having it. I've had a lot of gas too. I've had mild nausea which I do tend to get with IBS, and a little fatigue but other than that I feel normal. What makes me question whether I have a bug or not is that there's a few outbreaks in my area, but I've had very little known exposure to it.

"Where do I even begin... My IBS problems are mainly bloating, loose stools and recently diarrhea.
This past Friday, I got diarrhea and afterwards my stomach felt super tight and bloated. It has been really bloated ever since. The only thing that works when I'm bloated is Silicea. I took one packed last night (Saturday) before bed and the pain intensified (I think it was due to my dinner though). I have been in SO MUCH PAIN today. I can't even decribe the pain I've been in. But it's like... That soreness in your muscles the day after you workout BUT IN MY INTESTINES KIND OF?! I know it's probably just a lot of trapped gas because it vanished for around an hour after my stomach was grumbling a lot. Then it came back after I drank some blueberry smoothie with probiotics. It's making me nauseous as well.
I don't know what to do. I have been doing stool tests like 3 months ago. I also eat gluten and dairy free, I eat probiotics. After the stool tests, my doctor just said ""you have IBS"". Well, tell me something I don't know.. So I'm not getting much help.
Is this really normal? I'm also having my period right now btw.

"I'd really appreciate some advice on the following.
I was diagnosed with pain predominant IBS just over a year ago at the age of 52. I had had occasional episodes of 'nervous diarrhoea' in my late teens and twenties, then decades without any such problems. My current experience is really different, it's a deep pain like when you burn yourself on the iron, and extremely localised in one place.
When I was diagnosed the pain was waking me up at night and I was finding that in order to pass wind I had to change position, as if it were getting trapped in one place.
I was prescribed various painkillers and antispasmodics. The painkillers allow me to keep my job, though I cannot have any sort of social life or leisure activity, I basically just down my pills, go to work, stagger home, go to bed, and I only go out anywhere else if I have to, because of the fatigue and pain.
I am noticing that despite changing my diet and despite all the painkillers the attacks are closer together and increasingly more painful. I barely have a day of respite. When I first went to the doctor about it, it was a very slight pain that I only noticed when bending to the left. Now it is really hard to concentrate on anything else. I find it really hard to connect the pain I am feeling with the descriptions of cramping and spasms typical of IBS.
I've had scans, X-rays, etc to rule out cancer, and at the time all these picked up was a small amount of diverticulosis.
All I can say is that it is absolutely nothing whatsoever like the 'nervous diarrhoea' episodes of my youth and that the pain feels worse--not just in the sense of 'more painful' but of 'differently painful' as in a much deeper, sharper pain as if I'd eaten a sharp object or something were being stabbed deeply into me. I can feel no lumps or anything else.
It's really hard to explain it in words, but I wondered whether this quality of pain was typical of IBS. Is it normal for IBS to get slowly but inexorably worse? Why does it feel so different, and in a different place, from diarrhoea cramps? Why does wind get trapped until I shift position, and why does the pain go away (completely and instantly) when I manually lift my lower abdomen upwards?
If anyone can relate to this, I'd be very grateful.

I also have some pain below the right side of my ribcage. At first I thought it was a stomach virus, but after going away for 3 days, it has now come right back. I do have GERD, but it has never made me nauseous to this extreme and it doesn't really explain the accompanying diarrhea. It is really effecting my ability to work and being that I just started a new job, I am stuck with a lapse in insurance, so a doctor really isn't an option for the next couple of months.

Long story short, he did a series of blood tests, inc Coeliac screen and all came back negative which was good.
I should point out that I did lose a parent at the start of the Summer, which has been quite stressful with other family members, and am still greiving, even though I feel fine in myself.
However, over the past couple of weeks, I have had a gurgling stomach a lot of the time, and sometimes the urge to go to the toilet (stool) for a 2nd time in the day, after tea, when I always used to just go in the morning.
No blood in stool, no Diarrhea, no loose stool, no pains, but a lot of gas and wind, so sometimes an explosion on the toilet with some mucus.
I have never experienced any IBS before, but with my bereavement etc, does this sound like IBS?
I have spoken to my GP again who has given me perscription to take for IBS.
Also he has said that as I only had a full screen of bloods, and they are all completely normal, that he's confident its nothing sinister.
As I've never had any IBS, i just wanted to check with other sufferers that this is normal for an IBS diagnosis?

"I have had IBS D for many years.
Two years back I reached the rather obvious (although I didn't see it at the time) conclusion that what I eat affects my IBS.
Reluctantly...as I hate giving up foods I enjoy, I looked at the Fodmap diet and started to cut out certain foods, for example, onions, garlic, wheat bread and more. This really made a difference. However, although improvement was a good 80% I still had sessions occasionally. With Fodmap it allows certain fruit for example strawberries, grapes, kiwis, so I continued eating those.
Trying to calm my bowel completely, I decided to cut out fruit completely. This has made a huge difference. Very sad as I like fruit and it's good for you, right..but maybe not for me, or you perhaps, it's worth a try I'd say.

"Hi
Had CT Scan, Ultrasound and FIT test and another type of stool test , also a number of blood tests and all came back clear.
Been diagnosed with IBS and not sure its correct as im bloated daily and also my lower abdomen feels tight most of the day.
I do not have any issues with the toilet and daily use with no issues apart from sometimes i feel i should have emptied a bit more.
My main issue is been bloated and not sure if i should investigate further as not sure what else i can test for.
To add im not losing weight ( if anything putting weight on) and no blood in stools as check regular with home test kits and also the current FIT test at the doctors
Any advice appreciated

"Ive been told I think with my gut. I'm 37 years old and had inconsistency ibs-m since age 18 or so. My stools are mostly on the loose side, mucous, gas bloating, but sometimes constipated for no more than a 32 hours.
In the last couple of years I've made my problem worse by drinking 2-3 beers twice a week. ive ignored my bowel habits for the most part attributed it to ibs and beer. During this time Ive noticed a flattened in diameter stool here and there but paid little attention to it. Figured it was caused by squeezing along with the ibs
About 9 months ago, I had itching for a few month's. I self treated with a steroid cream and it went away then a short time later I had one incident of blood on toilet paper. I immediately went to GP and she said definitely sounds like hemmorhoids but when she checked she only found scar tissue right outside. I told her the bleeding seemed to come from right outside so maybe a fissure. She had me continue steroid treatment and I havent had another incident. However, ive been closely monitoring my stools and noticed they consistently range with some degree of flatness.
I've quit drinking my daily cup of coffee, drinking beer, increased supplements, daily pro and pre biotic, aloe vera mixtures, you name it. Ive been watching my diet and overall my gut feels healthier than ever but my anus feels swollen with a pain only noticeable because I'm paying attention to it after passing a stool. No master what I'm trying it still comes out flat and sometimes when squeezing it feels like the end is being pushed to the left.
ive googled symptoms and dreadfully worried about cancerous growths blocking the stool in the rectum. I have an hmo so its taking a long time to see the gastro doctor. I'm scheduled to see next month.
Anyone else with a similar experience? Is this just my body tensing up from stress and ibs related? Any advise?

"I have had IBS for years now. My story is that I have a flare up, when it's over I may not have another for a week or maybe weeks. I have IBSd which is horrible. Out of the blue I have to rush to the toilet, It's just a huge rush of diarheea. I must then sit close to the toilet with my trouser open as a few minutes later I have to go again when there is another explosion. This goes on until my bowel is empty after an hour or so, with the most awful cramp. My huge problem is that I am scared to leave the house now as I get no warning at all of when this will next happen. I feel I would just die of shame if I had to go and I would not get to a loo in time. If I try to get info on diarheea it usually say s it lasts for days, not with me it is a few hours. Anyone have any help or have the same symptoms as me?

"Six months ago I had sex without a condom with a stranger woman, after 3 or 4 days I've begun to have  UTI symptoms, burning feeling while peeing, after 2 weeks my scrotum started to burn and my bowel movements changed completely... the shape, color, and consistency always changing.  My stools started to have black stains with a considerable amount of undigested food on it.   I've taken several  STD tests(40 days after the symptoms started), urinary/prostate ultrasounds and none of them had show any bacterias, abnormality or positive to any virus....  but the symptoms just keep going.  I had seen 4 or  5 different  Urologists, two of them gave me a prescription to antibiotics like ciprofloxacin and other antibiotic based on symptoms, not tests after I've taken all those antibiotics nothing changed. A lot of discomfort within the anus and some fluid stools coming out during the day, having to use wet wipe to clean my but because normal paper was too painful.
After 4 months I gave up from urologist and started to seek help with gastro,  After a colonoscopy, they found a little benign anal polyp, it was removed everything else was ok... The said that could be IBS, something related to stress and anxiety.
After six months I had a lot of meds, exams, etc.... and I still have flat stools with undigested food, anal discomfort, and scrotum burning.  I don't know what to do anymore, take another round of STD tests,
look for a proctologist to see if a have hemorrhoids(but could hemorrhoids affect my scrotum?). Some times I just wanna give up, my life became a nightmare...  What should I do?!

"I have had IBSd for years. I can go weeks or even months free of it but when I have a flare up it is awful. I have tried all sorts of foods and writing down everything I eat, each time but I just cannot see that what I eat affects me as my diet is more or less the same all the time and because I can go so long without symptoms. All of a sudden, I have to rush to the loo. I then cannot close my trouser because I know that within minutes I have to do a mad rush again. Thankfully I have 2 toilets in the house, so that one is always free for me and is only about 2 metres away for when I have to run. The diahorrea is just like after one has been given a drink to clean out ones bowel before an op. It is just explosive. I have to rush back and fore like this for maybe 30 to 60 minutes. By then I am exhausted, feeling I could pass out and the cramps are horrendous.  After that  I go for a lie down and that's it finished. Fortunately for me, this has never happened to me outside my home because I'd never be able to control my bowel. This has made me terrified of leaving my home just incase as I have no warning when this will happen. My doctor recommended I try Fybogel. I said to her that the last thing I needed was fibre but she asked me to please try it. The first day I knew it was going to help me, though it doesn't help everyone. I always felt as though there was something in my bowel, a sort of needing the loo but couldn't do it. I immediately felt that I could do a proper poo each day. I take 2 orange flavoured  sachets every day. Wonderful. The only snag is that it doesn't stop the diahorrea  when I have a flare up. I just want to say, maybe if you could try it it might be great for you too.  As they say "" it's good to talk"".

"So recently, I’ve been feeling really sick to my stomach. My guts hurt all the time. I have had severe stomach cramps and bloating, and really bad gas. Everything I’m eating gives me diarrhea. Or soft stools. And it’s yellow and floats. And after I have a bowel movement I feel really nauseous and uncomfortable and have a really bad upset stomach. I’ve also been having really bad chest pain and it’s hard to breathe. I’ve been having migraines. And really bad heartburn. I’m also really tired and exhausted all the time. My doctor also said I have carbohydrate malabsorption. I also have a hard time digesting dairy and gluten. And I’ve been having really bad pain and swelling in my upper and lower abdomen.

"Roughly every few days I've been having one loose (mushy) stool with cramps the rest of the day and some nausea, then I'll have days where I go fairly normally, sometimes a bit constipated. When it first started happening I would sometimes get heartburn and pass mucus and nothing else. The mucus and heartburn seem to have stopped now, but the random loose stools, nausea and pain are still happening frequently.
This has been affecting me for 2 months now (started after a particularly stressful event) and it's really getting me down, I have never experienced this before and it has affected my mental health dramatically. I don't want to do anything, go out etc. Should I see my doctor to confirm if this is IBS? What else does this sound like if not IBS?

I have also lost around ten pounds this month, im not overweight and im at college and for sure not trying to diet. i would just assume ibs, but a week or two ago i started finding these red sticks floating at the top of the toilet bowl, at least ten every time. it looks like tomato or red pepper but i dont eat either. i will attach pic. im just really confused why my health is going down the drain, and my parents have crap insurance and cant afford to pay for me to see doctors with any frequency. thanks for any insight!

"Hi,
I am not an English native speaker so there could be a few mistakes in the text.
I have had problems since I was 23 ( I am 28 now ). I used to be always skinny and I wanted to change it. So I started working out a lot and eating way more proteins and carbohydrates than I used to. Of course, I bought things like protein, bcaa, gainer, and creatine. So I gained a lot of weight. Unfortunately, most of the weight was obviously fat so I decided to reduce weight by carbohydrate cycling. I lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time and then it started.
I started to feel weird when it comes to digestion. After pooping I didn't feel the same relief as I used to. Also, my stool was getting quite yellow. When it comes to shape, sometimes it was just diarrhea, sometimes, it was very thin and solid, sometimes just some floating pieces.. but sometimes all was good. Sometimes I feel weird weakness in my entire body, especially in my joints and my digestion seems to be the cause of this. It is getting worse after pooping. I also feel cold sometimes and of course, I am bloated quite often. But sometimes I feel awesome and don't even think about my digestion, I feel so healthy, and then it comes again. It feels like there was some hole in my intestines that sometimes letting all the food inside my body and sometimes the hole is closed. Like today. I felt great since morning until 2pm. Then some food got to my colon and suddenly I feel cold, weak and have weird feeling in my belly. When gas comes out it smells so bad. I am not looking forward to going to the toilet since it is going to be even worse and I will have to use a shower to clean my anus.
I haven't found any connection between what I eat and how I feel. It is just coming randomly.
Of course, I have done all the blood tests, colonoscopy, endoscopy, ultrasound, etc. All was good including my other guts' tests. The only thing that could lead to something was a bit higher bilirubin. I had been working out a lot so doctors said it is completely normal in that case.
I have also tried a food sensitivity test which shows I shouldn't eat gluten products, milk, and pea. Apparently, I could have intestinal permeability which I have tried to fix by eating a lot of fiber, healthy fats, fishes, vegetable, fruits, grains, etc. But it didn't help. Actually, a lot of fiber in my diet made it even worse. My stool was more yellow and I felt worse after pooping. It seems there is no more help for me.
I really hope some of you guys used to have similar symptoms that you were able to fix or at least reduce.

"Greetings. This a lengthy story, all the (Side Note) paragraphs are not important, they are me just spilling my thoughts onto the keyboard. Feel free to skip them to shorten the port.
In 2017 I was hit with a pain so extreme that I was on the ground crying and calling 911. When they came, I was taken to the ER. There they tried to give me pain medicine such as Morphine and others, but the pain would not go away. Eventually it calmed enough for me to be able to leave. For the next 2 months I went to a Gastroenterology to figure out what was wrong with me, he did both an Endoscopy and a Colonoscopy, but found nothing but slightly inflammation in the Large Intestine. He did said I had IBS, but then slowly I just kind of forgot about it. I was able to eat Burgers and Fries and Wings and basically anything. The only time it hurt was when I had diarrhea.
Cut to 2019, about 2 months ago, I had once again, a pain that was out of this world. I was literally screaming and breaking things around my house from the pain. I almost dug my hands into my abdomen and pulled out my intestines just so the pain would go away. I was back at another ER. And again, not pain killers were able to stop the pain, not eve a bit. I was let go because I had ""nothing wrong with me"", even thought the pain was still there. 3 days of constant pain, not as bad as when I went to the ER, but pretty bad. I ate an apple, and all of the sudden, I was crying and screaming again, back to the ER I go. Once again, nothing wrong, and no medicine could help.
(Side note: I was there for almost 4 hours waiting for someone to even see me, I was literally screaming and shivering at the pain and no one even came by to give me a Tylenol or anything. Why are Hospitals like this? If a pain is so severe that the person is shaking from pain and begging every 10 minutes to see a Doctor, why wouldn't that be a priority? There were people literally playing on their phones laughing in the waiting room, and they were patients. Meanwhile I was there scratching at my legs almost peeling my skin from the pain).
Anyway, they found nothing again.
It's been 2 months a few days, and the pain has not gone away. I've seen two separate Gastroenterologist and no progress has happened yet. I had another Colonoscopy and Endoscopy, but once again nothing came up and they only found inflammations in the Large Intestine.
The deal is like this:
It hurts almost constantly Below my belly button.
Pain does happen in other places in my abdomen sometimes, but the one under the navel is always there.
Sometimes I go 3 days without defecating.
Using the restroom sometimes hurts, sometimes it doesn't.
I have not eaten anything other than white rice and soup with only a select amount of vegetables.
Sometimes it flames up really badly and it hurts incredibly bad.
I had Almond Milk one of these days, and I had immediate pain and diarrhea.
I've tried Peppermint Oil Pills and nothing happen (good or bad).
I've lost almost 50 lb in the past 2 months.
I've tried several Antispasmodic but none seem to work.
I have not had any blood in my stool. The stool was dark for about 3 days, but I had also been eating
blueberries all those days.
The hope I had has slowly been drained out of me. I've been essentially completely bedridden for the past 2 months. Everyday I wake up, I want nothing more than to go back to sleep. I don't want to be awake anymore. I've even called the Help Crisis Hotline several times because I've thought about cutting my abdomen open and pulling my intestines out. Nothing cheers me up anymore. I cry almost everyday, I lay on my floor and just cry.(Side Note: I had a full ride to college and I was all set to leave in August, but the pain prevented me from attending and I lost all the money. I haven't been able to work, the only funds I am surviving on are my college funds, but those are slowly draining.)
(Side Note: This pain has giving me so much despair that for a single second, on a particular day, I weighted the pros and cons of ending it all. And ALL of this in the span of 2 months. This constant, unbearable, agonizing pain has been there for 2 months straight, not a second of relief, not a moment of mercy.)
What can I do? I've had so many tests done to me. These include; several Blood Tests, several CT scans, several X-Ray Scans, Several Urine Tests, and a Colonoscopy and Endoscopy, but they have all came clean, all of them. According to these tests I am a healthy human being, yet I am in pain all day.
Can Anyone help me? Has anyone had this type of pain before and have figured out what this could be? Can anyone suggest any form to relieve the pain? Do you have any idea what this may be? Can anyone please help me?
(Side Note: It does suck that I have spend so much money in Doctors and they did absolutely nothing. One of them basically told me to go to another one because he could not find what was wrong with me. It seems they don't even care. They see me and quickly say ""Alright see you in 2 weeks"" while saying next to nothing that can help me at all. But they never forget to tell me to pay on my way out, oh no, that is the top priority here, not the fact that I am barely able to walk straight from the pain, forget that, the money is where is at.)
Thank You for taking the time to read this, I know I seem very angry but I have almost nothing left to try anymore, this pain has traumatized me and made me so bitter at everything. Please Consider leaving a reply, have a great day.

"Hello everyone. During this summer I was working on a stressful job and did not have much free time, so my diet was generally unhealthy, eating often junk food and sweets, and drinking too many carbonated drinks. Also, I was spending many hours sitting, without any physical exercise.
This brought changes to my bowel habits and made me have constipation and diarrhea a few times, but they did not last for more than one or two days so I did not pay much attention to it.
However one month ago I started having constipation and diarrhea more often. Sometimes I even had a combination of both. I also started to have a soft pain in different parts of my belly so I thought I got an outburst of IBS due to my eating habits and decided to change my diet. I stopped eating junk food and drinking carbonated drinks while I started eating less sugar. I also started eating slower and chewing more carefully.
About 2 weeks ago I stopped having constipation or diarrhea, but since then I have a form of steatorrhea almost every day: light brown to orange stools that are fatty and stain the toilet. Sometimes they float, but not always.
The pains I feel are not continuous, they usually come and go a few times a day, regardless if my stomach is empty or not. I wouldn’t say the pain is strong or annoying, but it is noticeable and it occurs in different parts of the belly, upper and lower, left and right. The last few days I also started feeling a soft “stabbing” and “stinging” in some parts of the belly, but this is possibly psychological, since I got stressful about the whole situation.
After various searches on the web, I found out that steatorrhea is usually not associated with IBS, but with pancreatic problems and other serious diseases, so I got worried. I am planning to have medical examinations soon but I decided to ask for your advice as well, since I am anxious.
Is steatorrhea experienced by other people with IBS or it is not common at all? Could it be related with some kind of food intolerance and how can I find out?
I have no nausea, vomiting tendencies, poor appetite or weight loss.
By the way I am 30, male and my family has no history of chronic diseases like pancreatitis or cancer. I am 209 pounds (95 kg) and I rarely drink alcohol. But as I said during the last few months I consumed a lot of fat and sugar without any exercise besides walking short distances.
Thank you for your time!

"Hey guys!
New to this forum and would love some advice. 2 months ago I went through a few strands of antibacterial for an overgrowth that eventually went away. Thank god cause it was painful, however, the gut issues afterwards are even worse...
Lately, I wake up in the morning feeling decent. My stomach starts to grow throughout the day though, about 9am its swollen, noon a bit more and by the time I leave work I look pregnant. Im not consitpated, trust me. I have two large bowel movements in the morning but I never feel quite empty. Ive been overloading on probiotics, vitamins and minerals which have helped my fatigue, but the bloating and inflammation doesnt go away. Peppermint has been amazing for the stomach cramps, but I still look pregnant. LOVE Aloe Vera, just dont know how much it has helped, if at all. Ive dropped 20 pounds since this started as well (im six foot one so I really cant afford to drop below 130 lbs, im at 138 now).
I guess I am just looking for advice, if anyone has had something similar or if you know the timeline one when this will FINALLY go away, that would be great!

"Hi guys,
This is my first time posting in the IBS section of Patient.info but I have ""suffered"" with IBS for near enough a decade (was only diagnosed 18 months ago though).
I have always had a ""dodgy"" stomach but it's gotten considerably worse over the past few years - this culminated in me seeing a Gastroenterologist early last year due to severe abdominal pain (right side) as well as really erratic bowel movements - I went for a colonoscopy & endoscopy - all came back clear but the diagnosis of IBS was made (and it made total sense after years of having all the tell tale symptoms!)
Over the past month I have been experiencing the same right side pain but it's moved to lower in my abdomen, it moves from front to back (or back to front) and is worse when I am sitting up - I have been to see my GP and they seem to think it's muscular. I have also noticed my stomach is making a lot of noise recently & that I am going to the toilet a lot more since the pain started. I also feel like I need to urinate more (even though I dont actually need to go) and just generally feel unwell from my chest downwards.
I am just looking for advise from other IBS sufferers - is this something you've experienced? It may well be a muscular issue that I initially started experiencing and I have become anxious subsequently and that has had a knock on affect with my IBS - just keen to find out if anyone else has had a similar set of symptoms/whether it was attributed to IBS.
Any advice would be most welcome, thanks in advance!
P.s. Male - 33 years old - on no medications/do not have any other helath issues.

"Hello I have had severe IBS for over 50 years. Had gallbladder surgery almost 2 years ago. Since the surgery I experienced all the most horrifying pain and sickness imaginable from extreme gastritis, hiatus hernia, gerd, nausea, yellow stools, horrible multiple food intolerances and unimaginable bloating.
My past reliable IBS symptoms have completely changed with the onset of post gallbladder surgery syndrome. While the first symptoms produced all the above side effects with upper abdominal bloating it recently changed to lower abdominal bloating with intermittent bladder pressure and more consistent lower right side pain that sometimes spreads and most always stays in the same area (about 3 inches to the right and 1 inch lower than my belly button.
My question: has anyone experienced a fairly stationary right lower side pain with IBS or after having gb surgery?
Had many negative tests but a colonoscopy which is advised but would be life threatening due to moderate diverticulosis etc.
Any input would be most appreciated.

The last week I've been forgetting to take my probiotics and other supplements and haven't been up on my water intake; and I'm on my period.

white bread, a sausage roll, a scotch egg etc., basically I went all in back on
gluten.
Then the symptoms came back with full force...
Initially after the first day or so i felt ok and thought
the fodmap diet had helped cure me, but about a day and a half after the gluten
binge the loose bowel movements began, this was followed by abdominal
discomfort over the next several days, with the loose bowel movements
persisting. By day 5 after the initial symptoms flared up my stomach discomfort
had subsided slightly but now my appetite has completely vanished and i feel nauseous
most of the time. It’s about 7 days since the flare up and since then i have
gone back to a strictly gluten free diet, although due to the lack of appetite I
am having to force myself to eat, and my bowel movements are also still loose
and much more frequent. During the last few days I have also began experiencing a really low mood and
quite overwhelming feelings of anxiety, which is not something i am used to.
Basically I was wondering if anyone else experiences similar
symptoms after consuming gluten or during an IBS flare up? And if so how long
does it take for the symptoms to clear up once being gluten free again and how long to feel normal again?
Thanks!!!

"I am 39 and Male. I have been unwell now for around a month. They still do not know what is wrong and it is getting worse.
It started with a gradual pain (getting worse) beneath my right rib cage and noticed blood on the outside of stools and a lot when wiping (which has since gotten worse too), and had also become irregular on movements rather than daily as normal. (perhaps every two or three days now). There is also a lot of white and yellowish mucus and bloody mucus when I go.
I went to doctors had blood tests and a week later had a endoscopy up the arse on my colon at the hospital and a scan on the right side and results came back a week afterwards showing nothing wrong.
I am now waiting for a urgent appointment with a stomach specialist at the hospital which is going to take about 5 weeks due to the state of the NHS.
In the meantime the pain is now intense. It is constant has also spread and I now feel pain around the belly button area with sharp twinges like something sharp is pushing inside and trying to get out. When the doctor pushed really hard on my stomach at the doctors the most pain seems to be between the rib cages just beneath them. I am not hungry but forcing myself to eat and eating normally (if that makes sense) and not having problems eating (Vegetarian and have been for years). I have also had slight discomfort in my esophagus and throat when swallowing, but not sure if this is related as I am prone to get colds and sore throats and still have a cough from the last cold I had quite a while back and just before all this started.
I have seen different doctors at the local surgery which have all had different ideas and given different advice. One told me to take Paracetemol and not to take ibuprofen or co-codamol as it could irritate it. Another told me to take co-codamol instead but neither have helped. I have tried Buscopan which was no help at all, and Mebeverine now and not sure if that is helping or not. I feinted on Monday and have also been having dizzy spells now too since starting the Mebeverine. The pain seems worse when lying down and sitting and better when standing, but is intense and getting worse beneath the right rib cage (like a stitch from running) and inside around the belly button area.
I am slim and healthy apart from that and only other thing I am on is sumatriptan (when required) for migraines as that's the only thing which cures them. I have also had Kidney Stones three times in the past, but that has come on sudden and pain was in a different area.
I have tried looking up online what might be wrong with me. Has anyone else had similar symptoms and what was wrong?

"Ah where do i begin. So a few months ago i was having some serious stomach cramps and constipation and i started bleeding a lot which i guess might have been from a fissure or hemorrhoid because sometimes it would also burn. I would see some blood like like every other week. It finally stopped after about a month or two but i started to feel pain when sitting, the pain didn't come from my anus actually it was located a little bit above my left butt cheek near the tail bone i assume. And i noticed that i was still straining during a BM and my stools started to look a little flatter, not paper thin just more squished looking. I went to the doctor for a slightly unrelated thing they used an ultrasound to check my pelvis and was told i had cysts in my ovaries. Now i read that having them can also mess with your bowel movements but i forgot to ask my doctor. She recommended more fiber and half a year later it actually has helped and i no longer see blood or have anal pain but almost every time i have a BM i keep feeling that discomfort in my tail bone and I'm not sure if i should be worried and get another check up.

"I'm in the process of being diagnosed for my IBS-like symptoms. My gastro did all possible tests-IBD panel, celiac, food allergies, autoimmune panel, thyroid and stool studies, including testing me for infection and H-pylori. Everything came back normal but the fecal fat is elevated. I did some medical research and saw that people with IBS tend to have higher levels of fecal fat secreted in their stool, above the normal 7 ml. Also, raised levels of fecal fat can often point to EPI-pancreatic inefficiency (which I doubt that I have because I have no known problems with my pancreas/symptoms or previous trouble with digesting fats). Is anyone here who was diagnosed with IBS has/had an issue with elevated fecal fat levels or familiar with this issue?

"Hi All-
Have had a bout of IBS - M for a few weeks now. Started out as diarrhea and bloating and now I'm dealing with constipation and bloating the last couple days. The problem I'm having is the lower back pain. I have days where I have no pain at all, and then days it's there all day (starting when I wake up with gas). It's the type of back pain that aches and makes me feel like my lower back is out. I can also feel my stance is different from the bloating...like its jutting my stomach more outward and arching my back more. I notice my back even pops more in that area when I bend over to try and relieve this discomfort. I had taken Bentyl when I had the back pain with diarrhea which took it away, but I can't take it with the constipationbecause it slows my bowels too much and it does nothing for the back pain with the constipation, anyway. I, also, have cramping all day off and on, but produce very little stool. Heat packs help some, but not a lot. Has anyone experienced this? What did you do to help the pain?

IBS symptoms completely wore off after I changed from sunflower oil to lard while frying meat. I think those oils from plants are highly cancerogenus when used for frying. Now I feel well.

"For the past 4 weeks, I have had a stomach pain, more uncomfortable than pain really, in the sides of my Stomach. Some bloating, and some twinges, twitches, as well as gurgling, and noises which I don't usually have.
I don't know if this is stress related, nerves, or something else.
I have visited my GP on numerous occasions and he has checked me over and given me Peppermint oil to settle the stomach, which hasn't really helped.
I was also given Lanzoprasole, again which didn't do much.
My GP thinks it could be stress related, as I have been through quite a bit over the past couple of years, and he also had some blood tests done, for Celiac Disease, and blood counts.
All came back negative which is good.
I have had no Diarrhea, no loss of appetite, no bleeding, no sickness or vomiting, just stomach cramps, and occasional feeling of needing the toilet.
I also tried Wind-Eze, Senokot, and IBS tablets all of which did a little, but it came back.
It has now subsided a little, and for the last couple of days, had pain in my testicles.
I have never suffered from IBS or anything before (I am 46) or I am thinking it maybe a sudden Food Intolerance, but I have been told that most of the Intolerance Tests online are poor and awaste of money? and the NHS doesn't carry out anything like this.
Could this be trapped wind? as I hear it can make its way anywhere on the body and cause pain.

"I have experienced IBS since 25 years of age. The thing that has helped me the most is a medication called Levsin. Sublingual tabs are the most effective because you slip it under your tongue and it stops the pain within a couple of minutes. Ask your PCP or Gastroenterologist about it - it has been life changing for me but the key is to keep the medication with you all the times because getting it under your tongue as soon as the pain begins is the key for effectiveness. You can purchase a little card with an opening at the top that you can keep the tablets in and it fits in your wallet like a credit card would. Keep medication in a medication bottle by your bed also. I promise you it will be life changing in managing your pain. You can also place your head on your knees if you feel like you are going to faint and are sitting upright or lie down on the floor and put your feet up on the sofa or if that isn't possible just try to elevate your legs somehow to slow down the dizziness/nausea (if you have nausea. Sometimes an attack can cause a fast heart rate (A-Fib) and this impedes blood flow to your lower extremities and you can experience a syncope event or fainting and thus falling. Hope this helps!
As already mentioned a heating pad helps especially after the attack is over to help soothe your colon.

"Hi
I recently had a bit of a change up in my diet. I used to get ibs years ago, alternating between normal most of the time, sluggish/constipation some of the time and spasmodic colon a little of the time.
Since about March this year, I noticed my bowel getting very sluggish, the BM's were normal but it could go up to 5 days before I had a movement. The only dietary change was that I stopped adding nuts to my morning porridge - I'm fine with nuts except too many give me loose stools.
I was also starting to get a lot of colds so decided to improve my diet to get my system moving. I added the nuts back, got things going with some nightly warm lemon water and started to have fruit with my lunch instead of cake. Usually an apple or nectarine, plus small amounts of grapes through the day.
It really worked brilliantly, bowel in top condition. I stopped the lemon and cut back on the nuts but was enjoying the fruit do kept on with that.
Everything has been fine the past couple of months but 3 days ago, I had a perfectly normal morning BM, but about 10 mins after lunch, with an apple, I had the urge again. I never ever go twice in a day, and this was loose. Nothing following day, then the last 2 days I've just had morning BM's and both gave been very loose.
I know things likes apples and grapes can be a trigger, but would they start to cause problems almost 3 months later?
A couple of years ago, I started drinking more fresh OJ, but had to stop as it gave m diarrhoea, but that was about 3 weeks after starting it.
Just wondering if this could be a separate issue as I'm not sure what made my bowels so sluggish in the first place. The slight change in diet definitely helped, but could this now be sending me too far the other way?

"Unknown Bowel Issues……….Please Help!
Hello All,
I am reaching out in pure desperation in hopes someone can shed some light on whatever is going on with my body.
I am a 37 year old male who has had GI issues the majority of my life, however the past two years have been a nightmare battling constipation. I know the basics regarding what causes constipation, etc. This is more so an anatomy issue, at least I think.
Basically my body will not allow me to empty out. Gas feces, etc. collects in my lower abdomen- mainly my lower left side or under my bellybutton and just stays there.
No matter what I do I can not get my body to relax and pass things. I’ve taken Linzess, Trulance, Motegrity, etc. and nothing changes the problem, in fact it gives me the urge to go and the pain builds up.
This happens with gas too so I know it’s an issue with my body. It’s as if one part is turned off while the other is on. If I take laxatives before bed I’m able to wake up and go a bit. I have also taken Valium, Xanax, and Lorazepam and they too help a bit. I was also given prednisone for inflammation and that doesn’t help.
I have been to a ton of doctors and no one seems to get what is going on.

"Hi All,
For about a month now I've been having bowel problems. I started intermittent fasting and exercising a great deal. My husband and I went to a fair and I had a funnel cake and some fried oreos to break my fast which I usually break with vegetables and a protein. The next day I had this cramping pain in my stomach that I had never experienced, it felt like my lower intestines were being squeezed and rung out . After passing mounds of gas and going to the bathroom the pain was relieved. Suddenly (literally overnight) I became extremely constipated unable to pass any bowels. I stupidly rammed my finger up there in a frantic effort to pull something out and there was blood on my finger and then finally when I pooped there was mucus. I rushed to my doctors days later and the nurse practitioner looked back there but saw nothing but two huge scratches presumably from my finger. In the past month I've had days with normal bowel movements, diarrhea, and constipation consistently for a month. Some days my bowels are normal, other days their stringy, sometimes their flat, other times their skinny. Its so unpredictable its freaking me out. I got tired of reading about colon cancer and rectum cancer and GOOGLE somehow sent me here. My doctor is a quack and doesn't seemed concerned at all, he actually suggested that I take senna tea daily since that seemed to help. I'm at my wits end with this. I have a new doctor but won't see her until September. Oh and the only time my rectum doesn't feel tensed is when i take an Ativan. Not sure why that is. PLEASE HELP.

"Hello,
It is the second time I come here. First time I was trying to find something to control my symptoms. So I am using probiotics, CBD, anxiolytics and following a low FODMAP diet. It is not too bad, after a few months, I experience much less symptoms but there are some complicated days and I cannot continue the diet for long, as I noticed* I have lost 7 kg after starting it*, while I am not trying to lose weight and I am eating three times a day (sometimes even too much as I notice it triggers the IBS). I am not a great cook and do not even have an oven, so I do only simple things with not too many ingredients, although I added more and more slowly.
I think I have tried almost everything to relieve the possible symptoms due to eating and stress. Now I would like to ask if anyone here has tried the Fecal Microbiota Transplantation to cure IBS? It is rather new but it has proven very efficient against other diseases (and promising against many in the future); however it is on the experimental stage as far as I understood. This could be a nice solution to the problem, as it works in less than one day usually (and when it did not work, there was no negative side effect, only positive ones). And in this case, we can stop all other treatments. So, what do you think about this? I found it by myself, no doctors talked to me about it.

"Hi Guys, first post so a bit of a background about my situation.
I'm a fit and relatively stress free 30 year old male and about 4 months ago I began experiencing bad stomach cramps, lack of appetite, constant nauseas feeling, urgent and loose stools, fatigue. After a week or so I visited a doctor who suggested it was a stomach infection and to drink plenty of fluid and that my appetite would soon return.
A few weeks later I could still only eat the bare minimum, even that would be a struggle. And in the first few weeks I lost a over a stone, which is a lot for me as I'm already on the skinny side.
After a month I visited the doctors again and on request provided blood and stool samples, all which came back clear. After the first month I tried going gluten free to see if that helped, initially it did and my stools are much firmer as a result, however the fatigue and stomach cramps never really disappeared.
After 3 months I started to feel better and thought I was coming out of it, and then last week I suffered another flare up, although my stools have remained solid I'm experiencing constant abdominal cramps and lack of appetite, along with major fatigue. It's a viscous cycle as without having an appetite I can't maintain any level of strength in order to combat the fatigue.
I have also visited the doctors again this week and have been referred to a gastro consultant, although the doc did suggest it is most likely IBS.
I take colpermin capsules to ease the cramps but I find there effect are minor.
I've always been on the anxious side, but have never been depressed or anything like that. But I feel this condition is seriously effecting my mental welfare and close relationships at the moment, and I'm now avoiding/dreading social situations because of it. Its so frustrating how I can't understand how or why it has come out of nowhere.
Currently i'm not really eating during the day at work due to the nauseas feeling, and I'm only really eating at home during the evenings (which is a struggle).
I was wondering if anyone has been through and come out of a similar situation? in particular how to recover from a complete loss of appetite due to IBS? And if so do you have any advice on how to regain it?

"I know the title sounds odd--but do other sufferers find that they can't relax at all, and feel constantly on edge because of the IBS? I find I'm unable to enjoy things at all, and when I try to work out why, it's always because of the constant nagging pain, both from the IBS and from fibromyalgia. I just can't feel comfortable in myself. Recently I had a general anaesthetic for a different issue, and on coming round I was having a beautiful dream and was relaxed in a way I hadn't been for years, since before the IBS began. TBH I am dreading the prospect of decades of life which I can't enjoy any more.

"Hi all,
I’m 23 years of age and around 3 years ago I had food poisoning in Ibiza, from then my bodies not been the same. Loose stools/constipation, flatulence, an under active thyroid, persistent bloating, mucus in stool etc. At times I notice a musty/sour odor too. I was unable to leave the house for around a month, had tests and was diagnosed with IBS (as it seems everyone with gastro issues is). I then was able to go private and had a breathe test that diagnosed SIBO - I completely changed my diet, following low-fodmap, gluten free and dairy free. Pain and inflammation subsided although I was still going to the toilet up to 10 times a day. Although the stools are usually soft, I sometimes have to use my finger to prod in aiding the stools to release. I started to feel better as I was able to control the symptoms more and it helps when your stomachs not always in spasm. In December last year I also discovered I had parasites (maybe the reason for foul smelling stools/wind). As far as I’m concerned these were eradicated after a few months with the help of a dietician/herbalist. I then went travelling as my symptoms had died down and unfortunately had another bout of food poisoning in Singapore and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis - after antibiotics, activated charcoal and probiotics I felt better and more in control of my symptoms again. So recently I’ve been having a burning sensation in my stomach, abdominal tenderness, fatigue, loose stools, urgency and excess mucus in stools as well as persistent bloating, foul smelling stools and uncontrollable leaky flatulence. I’ve been to the doctors a fair few times and the blood testshave shown everything is working ‘fine’, I’ve been tested for parasites several times and nothings showed up. The only thing that is off is my white blood cell count - it’s quite high. My doctor explained this is due to my body fighting off an infection - but has no idea where from or what it is as there are no markers shown on the blood test. I’ve been given antibiotics (shock) and am hoping it is just an infection that I can get rid of. I’ve also been referred to have further testing (an endoscopy and a colonoscopy) I was just wondering whether anyone’s had a similar experience or thinks all the symptoms have persisted over this duration of time due to this undiagnosed infection doctors didn’t know I had?
As most of you who suffer from gastro issues know the anxiety that comes along with it isn’t very pleasant. I’m currently not working and have to put my life on hold to some extent as my symptoms are too intense to be able to sit at a desk all day. Always need to be close to a toilet and the thought of being on public transport puts me on edge!
Would appreciate your opinions/advice... thanks!

"Several months back I joined this forum because my doctor said I had IBS. I was told to trust my diagnosis from numerous people. I felt that something was not right so I continued to have multiple tests: ultrasounds, colonoscopy, endoscopy, blood tests, fecal tests, urine tests, xrays. Nothing could be found so I was told it was IBS. Turns out that persistence pays off. I never had IBS although I had all the symptoms. I had SIBO which is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Experts think that 80% of IBS case are actually SIBO. I finally got treatment and after 5 months the overgrowth is gone.
I wanted people on here to know that you should not always accept the IBS diagnosis because it could very well be something else. If I had accepted that diagnosis I would still be suffering horribly.

"I got diagnosed with IBS about 7 years ago but recently I've had cramps and pain in my stomach and my stools have changed drastically. They look shredded, tend to be light brown, normal and dark all at the same time and there are whole bits of undigested food/yellow chunks. (The stool isn't tarry or foul smelling) Is this normal during a flare up? Has anybody else experienced anything like this?
This is the first time its been this bad and the anxiety is getting to me.

"i have never been officially diagnosed with IBS but i am pretty sure ive always had it. i usually called it my nervous stomach because it always seemed to correlate with times of bad anxiety. for example, before i fly which is my biggest fear, i have to run to the bathroom multiple times. ive almost missed flights. ive had to run to the bathroom during takeoff etc. what comes out of me is almost liquid and not pleasant but luckily its usually centered around the anxiety trigger and it passes within a day or so after i calm down. This flare up seems to be following the worst stomach bug i have ever had. its going around the Phoenix area where i live, almost everyone i know has had it and i caught it from my 20 month old twins who had it first. it was severe for 2 days, worst headache ever, fever around 100.5, and the worst diahrrea i have ever had. it was like my insides had turned to liquid it was just awful and the gurgling and cramping was relentless. i felt better after about 3 days and didnt have diarrhea for a couple days i almost felt constipated but that was short lived and i have diarrhea every morning, often twice in a row if i have coffee and eat. i also started feeling like i had to urinate very often. the worse my stomach is feeling, the more i feel like i need to urinate. i was scared and went to my gyno who did a urine test and a very thorough pelvic exam because i was freaking out about it being a gynecological cancer and i was panicking. i just had my female yearly visit in march as well. she said everything still looked and felt great and since i am very skinny she said during a pelvic exam on skinny people you can easily feel if things are enlarged or tumors which she felt nothing bad in my pelvis. my urine was also fine besides she said trace anounts of red and white cells which is not unusual but no uti bacteria. as i type this i have this uncomfortable feeling like a pressure in my rectum like im going to have diarrhea but i already did twice and now nothing comes out but damn it feels like it wants to. it has been very loose and ive seen mucous a few times now. Does anyone get these feelings especially the frequency of urination feelings??? and anyone else who has had a bad flare following a bad stomach virua??? thats the things that are really freaking me out. after i eat dinner and get in bed my stomach gurgles and churns too. im ok all night but i wake up in the morning and have diarrhea. please anyone have any stories that are similar??

"I went to my primary care doctor with symptoms of IBS-which I had since May 20th, bloating right after eating, urge to go after eating, cramping on my lower abdomen and gas, also frequent urgency to go. Some days I'm almost ok and normal and then the next couple of days everything repeats. I do not have a diarrhea or constipation type but rather a mix (one large piece will come out solid and the other broken down-small spastic-colon chunks and pieces will follow, or when my tummy is really upset it will just be a soft pile of mush). No blood in stool, no red flags or fever, my appetite is good otherwise. He did not seem to care or listen, I literally had to hold his hand down just to do a basic metabolic panel blood works-which came back yesterday as completely normal. He suggested that I take probiotics and go on elimination diet, to exclude all dairy, sugar and wheat and see if my symptoms improve. Did not want to do an MRI or CAT scan. He also gave me a referral to see a gastro doctor if my symptoms did not improve and I still needed to go. I started taking probiotics and slippery elm and my symptoms seemed to have improved for a few days and then came back. So basically it varies day to day, one or two days are good and then I'm back to square one. Naturally, I'm feeling very anxious with this unresolved issue. Unfortunately, I currently do not have a private insurance/money to see a better doctor and tied to this medical group and the gastro referral that he gave me was to see a doctor/s on the edge of town (the only place/gastro that takes that type of insurance) where there's a homeless corridor and the doctor is rated 2 stars had numerous botched perforated colonoscopy jobs-thus I would never entrust such people to perform any invasive procedures on me, let alone a colonoscopy! So, I'm stuck and worried sick, assuming the worst things, of course. If these symptoms do not improve I have no other option but to go to an urgent care near my home which is sort of a mini hospital because they can run tests and have a CAT scan and an MRI inside and maybe I can persuade them to do some testing.

"I Have been diagnosed with IBS in 2015 and have had colonoscopy and endoscopy later in 2017. Colonoscopy showed some red patches which dr seemed to consider them as hemangiomas which he accidentaly found and I became incredibly scared about but since so many other dr assured me nothing to worry about I started to forget about. Last year I did another endoscopy because I had stomach problems and it seemed like h pylori had caused some problems along with a hiatal hernia. TREATED the hernia and then symptoms went away gradually. Since then I Have had bouts of ibs here and there but not even close . I mean not even virtually close as to what I am having right now. I have extreme tiredness, nausea , a lot of gas, as soon as I eat I either have trapper gas or need to have a BM and a pain on left side where stomach is which radiates to the back. Can this all be due to IBS? Can it feel this extreme? I feel like a living hell and have no idea what to do about it. I did have a ultra sound of abdomen and all blood work came out normal yesterday.

"44 years old female. Good fitness shape with a decent diet for years. IBS suffering for more than 8 years. I managed with it, with the right foods, the right mindset, acupuncture, exercise,, supplements ect.
About 1 month ago I started feeling a sharp pain in my left side, of my abdomen (see picture) it's so sharp and hurts. It's taking over my life, all I can do is lay in bed, it's depressing me and scaring me.
I went to a CT scan, 2 sets of blood tests (mri scheduled for next week) I went to gastro/family doctor and finally , in despair to the ER!
They ultimately said I have poop backed up in my colon. They gave me stuff they give out for colonoscopy prep to make you poop things out. I took it. I pooped a lot. Pain is still there. Then I went to doc today again,, suggested I do an mri, and gave me more colonoscopy prep drink. I've drank it 2.5 hrs ago and haven't pooped.
I've always been bloated and have sensitivity with constipation, bloating ect!
What is this sharp pain
Have anyone here experienced this? It's taking over my life. Please. . Any insight and guidance is appreciated....

"Hi,
I have an appointment with GP tomorrow to see if I have IBS. I'm feeling very stressed out, I've had symptoms since the end of May. I've been feeling gassy right after eating, frequent urges to go, feeling relief after emptying my stomach and then feeling of incomplete evacuation. The stool is never normal again in terms of shape of consistency -it's neither constipation or liquid but very mushy but my rectal area feels very strained and irritated afterwards. No blood in stool and the color is normal to light, just a lot of undigested pieces. It also varies from day to day, one day I will pass just one stool and feel almost normal but the next day will go around three times and never a normal solid poop and only a little bit will come out! I'm terrified of what tests they will offer to do. I cannot have a colonoscopy and refuse other invasive procedures and I know that first thing they do is insist on a colonoscopy ! What tests did your doctor conduct to diagnose and confirm IBS? Can I avoid a colonoscopy and get an MRI or a CAT scan instead to rule out any abnormalities?

"Hi, I have suffered with IBS for over 40 years which meant leaving the house each morning was a tribulation unless I had ""been""! My bowel was such that it didnt not work at all or it demanded instant relief! Being GI & lactose intolerant didnt help re food choices, but at least there were eventually lactase enzyme pills to digest dairy products for me! To cut a long story short I have been forced to have colonic irrigation a few times for really bad constipation, & the last CI therapist did tests on me & gave me a diet chart to follow which included Gluten Free rolled oats for breakfast & chicken bone broth for collagen intake. She also gave me enzyme capsules to take which covered lactose, sugar, protein, carbohydrates, & vegetables. Within one week my gut health improved & by 2 weeks & was experiencing normal motions that require a little pressure to evacuate, you know , like a normal person. Instead of jetsom & flotsam in the harbour there have been battleships, aircraft carriers & submarines!Only stress has any bearing on the fleet these days, however I am very shaky today after taking psyllium husks in rice porridge yesterday to substitute for GF rolled oats I had run out of & as a consequence upset my gut!

"I'm a 38 year old male, farily active and healthy. 
About 5-6 years back I began to develop unusual toilet habits, (unable to completely evacuate, softer stools, bloating, undigested food in stool/fast transit, and blood on tissue after wiping). They didn't appear all at once - it's been a gradual transition over the years.
I've had a conlonoscopy (about 4-5 years ago that found non-cancerous polyps that were removed anyway), a flexiable sigmoidoscopy and a hemmorhoidactomy. I also had some prolapsing tissue removed a couple of months ago (that was misdiagnosed as a hemmorhoid and coninuted to 'fall out' of my back package). My bum has been poked and proded by doctors fingers and instruments more times then I'd like to think about. About 9-12 months ago the Doctor told me 'it must be IBS'. I've had bloods taken and a few other things, too.
Some of the symptoms come and go depending on what I eat, but no matter what I cannot stop 2 symptoms:
1.Bleeding on toilet paper after I wipe. The blood isn't there straight away - but after around 7-8 wipes it's like something opens and all of a sudden blood appears on the paper. 99% of the time it's not too much. It's always bright red. I admit that I clean my bum thoroughly and am a bit obessed with it. I've had prolapsing piles in the past that have made it difficult to keep clean, so I am in a bit of a habit to ensure it's spotless down there. This has been going on for years now. 
Incomplete evacuation. The majority of the time, I'll go in the morning and it feels as though there's more to come out. I'll continue with my day and an hour-2 hours later I'll 'finish' my poop off. This has occurred over the last 2-3 years. 
I'll most probably go back to see my GP, but I get the impression I'm annoying them with my frequent visits about my rear end and my toilet habits. I've had at least two GP's tell me words to the affect of 'from what I can see, there is no need for any further tests to be done'.

"Hi Everybody
Just wondering if anyone tell me if an IBS attack can come on really suddenly, with no warning at all.
I only ask as all day I have been feeling fine until about an hour to go when I started getting some discomfort in my lower abdomen. The discomfort turned into painful cramps in no time at all from the initial discomfort feelings, then I had to rush to the toilet which ended up being a rather messy and smelly event. I also had some red blood dripping from my bottom, but I was diagnosed with hemorrhoids at my last colonoscopy about a year ago, so I'm presuming the force of my bowel movement has aggravated them a bit. All I'm feeling now is pretty drained, quite a bit of nausea and abdominal cramps.
I have been diagnosed with IBS, but I've never known it to happen so fast, I usually get a bit of notice before I will need to go, but this attack was much quicker than usual. The other weird thing is I will not need to have another bowel movement, I get IBS but without the need for frequent trips to the toilet.
I'd be grateful for any thoughts and comments on the points I have mentioned, especially whether it is normal for IBS attacks to happen so rapidly.
Many thanks in advance.

"I'm hoping that someone can shed some light on my symptoms. I've feeling a lot of gas and bloating. More like passing gas all day long, sometimes the symptoms ease up but they get worst after I eat or sit down. I have a lot of rectal pressure-almost the feeling like sometimes is stuck in there or an irritation. I have frequent urges to use the bathroom but not much comes out and when I do go I feel like I haven't emptied my stomach all the way. I would say that the gas, constant rectal pressure, and feeling of not emptying my stomach completely are the most prevalent symptoms. I do not have any blood in my stool and my stools range from normal consistency to a soft mush. The same thing happened to me one month ago and went away-so I just assumed it was a stomach bug, but now it came back again and I'm really concerned. I know that a sedentary life style and stress can cause IBS-I do sit around 8 hours at my desk and have a lot of stress in my life. Could this be IBS? I'm terrified to go to a doctor because they are obsessed with performing colonoscopy and endoscopy and I can't have them.

"Good evening. I've been feeling generally unwell for about 3 months. It started with really frequent urination and stomach pains and doctor said just a urine infection so was given antibiotics for a few weeks. The urine part cleared up after 3 4 weeks but I'm left with stomach and back pains and feel really tired all the time. I've hardly been to the doctors before but have been back 3 times now. the stomach pain is better but a dull stabbing in my lower groin made worse when I push in this area. the back pains are mainly lower back and sides but do seem to go up to the shoulder blade sometimes. I am yawning all day long and feel so miserable but not down about anything about from this. Doctor had said uti and did a finger up the you know where exam! He said the prostate was normal but a little inflamed because it hurt but nothing to worry about. He suggested Biokult which I have started a week or so ago, is this a normal thing to suggest rather than antibiotics etc? He said we all have a bit of IBS and I probably have that too as I said the pain in stomach seems to relate to eating and going to the toilet. Anyway to make matters worse I have fresh red blood when I go to the toilet. Even though I think I can feel what I can only assume is a hemorrhoid this has made me super paranoid and convinced me I have bowel cancer. I'm 40 and Male, I feel like I am detached from my body and in a bit of a daze most of the day, any advice appreciated.

"Hi everyone,
I've been suffering with IBS-D for a few years. I heavily rely on immodium, but have found that I usually need to take 5 or 6 a day now in order for them to work. I do take them almost daily, even as a precautionary measure.
Since the weekend before last, I took 4 immodiums in the morning but I was feeling nervous as I was going to a BBQ. I felt an upset stomach coming on, but didnt have access to a toilet (it was on the beach) so I took a 5th immodium. I somehow managed to last a few hours, but when i got home a had a bad bout of diarrhea, followed by another about an hour later. I then took 2 more immodiums - total of 7 that day which is the most I've ever had. I then was okay for the rest of the day/evening.
The next morning i passed about 3 solid stools (took 5 immodium), then I had bad stomach pain, and then diarrhea came on again, so took another immodium. I was okay for the rest of the day.
Then the next day, I couldn't go at all. I went to work, then came home for lunch. All fine, then all of a sudden I had an urged to rush to the toilet and had a bout of diarrhea again. Later on, I passed a solid stool.
Next morning, passed normal stool, but whilst eating dinner in the evening I got anxious and diarrhea came on again.
I then got myself into a really anxious state (I suffer from anxiety).
I took the next day off work - had solid stools all day - but spent the whole day worrying about eating dinner as I thought this would bring the diarrhea on again, and then 2 hours after dinner I had two bouts of diarrhea again.
The next morning I had sort of normal stools again, took 4 immodium, got worked up about my evening meal, and had diarrhea again 2 hours after dinner. But I was literally thinking about my stomach all day and how it would be upset after dinner.
The next day I took 6 imodiums which seemed to stop me having any more bouts, but my stomach hurt all day.
Then on Saturday I had diarrhea for most of the day, even after 5 immodiums. I took a 6th and this seemed to stop it.
On Sunday I decided to go without immodium. I had a couple of bouts of diarrhea and then in the evening it was more solid.
I then read about silicol gel and started taking this sunday night and have taken 3 times yesterday and once so far today.
It seemed to be helping a bit yesterday, had a bout of diarrhea in the morning, but in the evning I was going a lot but it was solid.
Today I am having lots of bouts of diarrhea.
My anxiety about it is out of control and I can't stop thinking about it and panicking about having diarrhea. I feel like this is never going to stop and this is my life now.
I'm also worried that I've damaged my stomach from all of the immodium.
I can't get out of this panic and upset stomach cycle.
Has anyone else experienced this? I can't stop worrying about my stomach, which is making it worse, which is making my anxiety worse and so on.
Has any one else gone through this? Is there light at the end of the tunnel?
Thank you in advance for any advice.

"ive been having another round of odd symptoms that may or may not be connected to ibs. Pain at the top of the butt cheeks and hip pain and then i felt pain in the back of the thigh and eventually the front thigh and then the entire butt area feels like its burning but right now the burning is only on the right side. I dont get the classic radiating feeling that sciatica has so dont think its that but again i could be wrong. The bottom of my spine also hurts to touch and i feel stiff in the lower back in the morning. Also have anal discomfort and pain when I squeeze the butt muscles in . Did research on these odd symptoms and came up with conditions like sacroilitis and pudendal nueralgia. Apparently sacroilitis should be detected on an abdominal ct which ive had so im leaning more towards the other one..but does anyone with ibs also have been diagnosed with these other conditions? or at least experience these issues and ibs? it seems to be worse at night and less during the day. I get cramping in lower abdomen at night too. Ive been referred for physical therapy and hoping that could figure it out.

"Hi Everybody
I've been diagnosed with suspected IBS for some time now following numerous tests, scans and scopes all came back clear. Up until a few days ago I was feeling quite good, then that afternoon I started to experience some very extreme bowel spasms, best described as something moving around inside my bowels trying to get out. Since then I've had almost constant churning, gurgling, popping feelings and noises going on inside my bowels, so bad that at points you can actually physically see these noises and feelings on the surface of my skin. I've had moments like this before but never so prolonged and intense, and it's starting to freak me out a bit. Physically I don't feel too bad, no nausea or sickness, bowel movements haven't changed and are still pretty normal for me, it's just these mad bowel movements and sounds that are quite unnerving.
I'd be interested to know if this is considered normal and whether other IBS sufferers experience the same?

"Hi, I think I have IBS, down to eating too much bad food and sugar. I'm trying to stop now of course. But I was wondering, do any of you have issues with going to the toilet frequently during the night, when you have an IBS flare up?
I do drink a lot of water during the day, and have a few protien shakes. But I do not drink after 6pm, but I'm still waking up all night and going to the toilet. I have even had to move into the spare room. I have been using disposable bottles, to gauge how much sometimes I go 2 pints worth!!
I have had a PSA blood test to check for prostate cancer..
Does IBS make the body retain water? I only have a problem when lying down. I wake up most nights and have to take a Co codamel.
Does anyone else get bloated, water retention, which leads to my toilet trips during the night.
Thanks.

"Hi there,
I have struggled with IBS for about six years now.
Last July, I developed what is known as an infected anal fistula from my (as you probably know!) more-than-regular toilet usage. I was then diagnosed in August by a consultant with the problem, the only treatment being surgery under general anesthetic.
Since then, I have been on painkillers such as Codeine which are terrible for the stomach, but the fistula pain is so overwhelming at times that taking painkillers is unavoidable if I wish to continue with ordinary life.
I then moved house and due to a change of area, the hospital in that locality would not let me book an operation, but made me go through the dehumanising process of seeing a GP, then consultant, and so forth to book my operation again. During this time I was hospitalised twice as I could not walk from the excruciating pain, and continued to up my medication.
After finally being given an operation date in January, this was then cancelled during my pre-op due to a hereditary heart issue that I needed to be cleared for, despite it not impacting your life until you reach old age (I'm 27).
Following an all clear from my heart test, I attempted to rebook my operation and was told to go BACK to the GP and book further heart tests, despite them previously saying to rebook it straight with the hospital following the all clear.
Therefore, I went to the GP where she helpfully wrote a letter saying I did not need to be referred for more tests, and to rebook my op. I rang the operations department for the millionth time, and they told me to wait, and they'd get back to me on the day. Two weeks later, after hearing nothing, I called, and they said I would have to go back to the GP and begin the entire process again with a doctor's appointment, then consultant referral, tests etc. Ridiculous, I know.
Anyway, after telling them that was unacceptable (in a stern fashion) and speaking directly to the colorectal surgeon's secretary, they booked my operation in for this Wednesday. However, today they rang to tell me that it was to be cancelled as they were too busy with other operations and mine was not a priority, despite it being cancelled previously for spurious reasons (as the doctor conducting my pre-op assessment suggested).
They said it could be in two weeks, but is liable to get cancelled again. I have suffered for over 9 months now with this pain, and the regular consumption of painkillers and inability to perform properly at work and so forth is severely impacting my physical and mental health.
I am now at my wits end with this situation - and nearly in tears when I think about it, the pain is truly unbearable and has resulted in many sacrifices, such as giving up my beloved dog as I could not provide sufficient exercise. So my question is - would an official complaint get me anywhere? And has anyone had experience with such complaints? I do not want the added stress to only be turned away again by the frustrating NHS system.
Thank you for your time,
Ed

"So last year in August I had a colonoscopy which came back all fine. The last 10 days I have had loose stools going to the toilet about 3-6 times a day. The first stool seems to be covered in mucous. I just came off antibiotics and anti-acids before all this started for treatment of h.pylori. I had an endoscopy done last week which came back showing only very small amount of inflammation in my stomach and the doctor said nothing to worry about.
I was diagnosed with IBS years ago but it has always been constipation related never loose stools. I had a stool test done only 2 months ago to check for parasites because my constipation had become worse and I had noticed large amounts of mucas in my stool which the doctor said is likely just ibs.
I am highly stressed and am wondering if that is why I have been getting loose stools.
Today I had a very small amount of fresh blood in my stool however I think it's just from hemorrhoids as I have had blood from hemorrhoids before so I'll wait a few days before going to the doctor if it continues.
I has an ultrasound done on my stomach only 2 months ago because I was severely constipated and had stomach pain which has since subsided. The ultrasound had come back normal.
Has anyone else experienced these symptons with IBS and is it likely due to stress?

"Hi everyone,
quick back story on me: September of last year i had my gallbladder taken out. Had a lot of digestive problems. I almost died as i couldn't hold anything down. 2 months later, i was diagnosed with c diff which is a bacterial infection of the colon. I took Vancomycin which is a antibiotic, 2 months later i relapsed with c diff, put on another vanco course, then Dificid which is a antibiotic made especially for c diff. i just finished it this past Sunday.
Now i'm still having nausea, loss of appetite, i'm now constipated, i get heartburn sometimes, pass a lot of gas all day, center of my tummy is tender, i burp a lot, i'm losing weight because of the nausea and loss of appetite. My heart rate stays up past 100. I get stomachaches sometimes. When i use the restroom, when i wipe, it's yellow. i feel weak and shaky. Can't sleep right. I'm on a bland diet, have been for 7 months.
A few months ago, my GI did bloodwork and everything came back normal. i've also have had CT Scans, Upper Endoscopy. Those came back normal. I had a MRI, and it showed mild inflamation in my colon, but my GI wasn't worried.
I'm depressed because of all of this. i've been dealing with this for 7 months. The nausea is the worse. I can't work right now. My GI can't figure out whats going on.
I just want to know what is going on with me.

"I'm a 44 y/o female. I was diagnosed 15 years ago with IBS-C. It never bothered me a lot until the last couple years. I've had a couple of flare ups and my IBS seems to have changed to IBS-M. Last year in February and May respectively, I had an abdominal CT and a colonoscopy, both which showed some mild inflammation, but nothing concerning. December I had another flare up which lasted 3 weeks. In early January, I started a new regimen which included no dairy, no soy, no eggs, and no gluten. I started several supplements including juicing 16oz of celery every morning taking Ester-C, Methylfolate, Cat's Claw, B-12, and zinc. in addition to what I had already been taking Curcumin twice daily and Melatonin 5mg x 2 years. At first, the celery juice caused my stomach to be upset, but after 3-4 weeks, I felt great! I felt energetic and healthy. Then, in mid-March I started feeling like my peri-menopause symptoms were getting worse, so I added Maca root to my supplements. Within a week, I was having nausea, loss of appetite, watery diarrhea alternating constipation, gas, bloating, belching, delayed digestion, and mid abdominal tenderness and severe cramping (especially after eating or drinking ANYTHING). I stopped ALL supplements and went back to a regular diet. It took a week, but the cramping and nausea subsided for the most part and my appetite got better. (I did notice the cramping and nausea returned when I tried to start drinking my celery juice again.) I have been consuming 1500-1800 calories daily in the last week, but oddly I'm still losing weight (down 3.5lbs in a week). I have loose stools (sometimes watery) every morning once sometimes twice - no blood- but it never changes color- always yellow/orange. Today, I ate a lemon poppy seed muffin and saw the seeds in the commode 30 minutes later. Oddly enough, at times, I experience constipation by the evenings. I have an appt with my GP, but has anyone had this experience? Is this IBS? A malabsorption issue? Exacerbation from supplements? I know no one has a crystal ball...I'm more asking about others experiences with this and what was causing it. I'm stumped... If this is IBS I've never had it like this before.

"hi all,
For the past 5-6 days I had instant constipation with no pain at all from a takeaway. I've eaten loads of fibre and hardly anything is happening I'd be lucky if its half a stool or it would be a really sloppy stool and that's it and even then it is a struggle for me to poo. I also have a lot of itching around my anus which I think is piles or hemorrhoid. I have had NO blood or pain anywhere in my rectum or bowel. Could this be a really confusing constipation or something else. I am quite worried due to this never happening before and that I can poo but then not get anything else out.

I have been prescribed paracetamol by my doctor and amitryptiline at night in low doses (c. 30mg). I've tried different antispasmodics without success. Is it normal for the pain to be this severe?

I've also had sort of a pinching pain in the lower left abdominal area close to the groin. I have, for years, had a general dull pain come and go in that area but have not had the pinching pain. It's not constant. But it will come and go.
The only thing different I'm doing is taking a new type of enzyme to help me digest the iron I take for iron deficiency anemia. I have to take one or two pills per day or every other day. I'm thinking it could be the iron. I've taken it for about two years.

"Hello,
I would like to talk about the FODMAPs diet. I can follow more or less easily the monash app recommendations but I do not understand how FODMAPs cumulate. What happens if I eat 5 kg of food per meal but only allowed food in appropriate quantities? This should be too high in FODMAPs, right? How do I know the limit since each ingredient may have different properties and different sugars? Can I eat 500 grams of meat if I am hungry since it is low in FODMAPs and has green light? These questions are puzzling me. As the offer in dietitians in my city is not broad and very expensive, I would like to seek advices here before going bankrupt to get an appointment.

"Hello,
I am used to take Valium or Xanax in case of general stress and it works pretty well. My former doctor also told me that Atarax was more fitted for gut related diseases. But my new doctor prescribed promethazin instead. It does not look like a regular anxiolytic (I read it is a neuroleptic and I have never taken this kind of medicine). I have read also it contains wheat and lactose, so I have two questions for people who have taken some of these anti-stress pills. I asked for cannabidiol but she did not consider this option.
Do you think promethazin is a good choice for IBS? Especially if I start a low FODMAPs diet?
From your own experience, which would be the best anxiolytic to take in this case (or also cannabidiol)? It has become hard to go to work due to the disease as I was going up to 15 times a day to the toilets during several months even when taking several pills of loperamid per day. It has calmed down a bit now but I still feel pain, exhausted and fear to go outside.
Thank you for any help.

It is the best thing for severe constipation and diarrhea this is what is causing all stomach problems ie pain/bloating/worry/stress........
And for long journeys or Important day out take
diarrhea tablets
I have used it for years and given me comfort throughout the day
Forget all these things Buscopan crap all in the mind doesn't help underlying problems
All these monitor foods hard to keep track what reactions caused
I believe my IBS linked to Diabetes/Dairy/Gluten and if too much spice
Eat Healthy and Exercise
Please don't comment Fybogel negative without trying few weeks/months
Good Luck

"Hi
I've not been on the forum for ages because, although self-managing my IBS and diverticulosis symptoms, being afforded the ability to work from home during a flare up meant that I felt I was coping with this chronic condition.
For some reason, my employer has now decided that they no longer want to allow me the flexibility to work from home. An Occupational Health review in Apr 2016 said that I was fit to carry out my contractual duties at work and the only reasonable adjustment required is to allow me home-working during a flare up. In a team of 7 full-timers, 4 of us are able to work flexibly, although I'm the only one that does this due to reasonable adjustments and on an 'as needed' basis instead of a set pattern taken weekly / or alternate Fridays.
I've averaged 14 days of flare ups since 2015 and have only needed to take sickness absence for non-related issues on 2 occasions totalling 4.5 days. Yet, in spite of not reaching the absence management trigger, and only working from home for 8 days of flare ups, my employer felt it necessary to review my occupational health arrangements. I had questioned the validity of the request, but when assured it was to check to see if they're supporting me all the ways that they can, I happily agreed first to an OHU referral, but then it was amended to a 'Request for Medical Records from a GP'.
In my GPs response, he pointed out that I have the two chronic conditions that had been diagnosed by their referral to a specialist Gastroenterologist, and by following the fodmap food management programme 'and the support you provide by allowing home-working', the GP confirmed that I'd not needed their support with the symptoms since Feb 2016. And here's the problem...
...it was suggested by my line manager that because I'd not been to the GP each time I'd had a flare up, that this meant the GP's report was of little use. So, having spoken with HR, they were only going to allow me the flexibility to work from home 6 days a year; any IBS flare ups occurring after the 6 days meant that must take sickness absence...and be monitored through the absence management process?!!?!
I've requested clarification from HR on the following points:
why must I take absence when I'm fit for my contractual duties with reasonable adjustments?
why am I denied the ability to work flexibly when 3 other team mates are allowed to do so?
HR have come back and said they'd like to arrange an informal meeting between the 3 parties. Can any of you offer me some guidance in preparation; particularly about the legitimacy of their claim that once diagnosed, I must still seek medical assistance whenever I have a flare up? Out of our full team of 12 L&D professionals (I design the online learning and manage the online library of content), my line manager has 4 direct reports. Her management style asks us to fill out a daily WIP sheet, so she can see what we're working on and how much time it takes. This isn't a problem, once analysed it shows where we've been productive or where we can streamline a process. But the point is that my line manager can see in real-time my productivity levels as I keep this up to date when working from the office or at home. There is no reason to believe that when I'm home-working, I'm NOT working.
I've got access to all my systems, my emails, and my team when at home; the only thing I don't have is a work phone. My manager said that the rationale for not letting me have the reasonable adjustment to work from home is because if someone needs me urgently, they have to wait for me to have read an email request...and that is unacceptable to the business apparently?!?!?! All 12 of us L&D professionals are either in and out of meetings or delivering learning through coaching or workshops, so we all have an agreement that any request will be answered in 24 hours. It makes no sense that a person needing to wait a few hours for my email response - or me calling them back from my personal phone - is in someway detrimental to my business?
Again, any guidance or clarification is much appreciated.
Many thanks

"Hi there. TMI. A bit of back story. I had constipation in November 2017 and i ended up bleeding. I was so scared, i went to see a GP who did a digital Rectal exam and diagnosed me with an anal fissure which healed on its own and i had since a normal bowel movement. In March 2018, i had a relatively normal bowel movement but when i passed it, it felt like razors cutting. When i wiped, i saw blood. I immediately scheduled an appointment with a a physician. She did a DRE and diagnosed me with an internal hemmorhiod. I was not convinced so i scheduled another appointment with a GI and pushed for a colonoscopy. This was done 10 days later and the results were a normal colonoscopy no hemmrhoids or anything.He just said i might have had an anal fissure that healed on its own. I was asked to up my fibre intake and fluids. This has helped pretty much and i am pretty regular with normal round stool until i started seeing a groove/ridge in my poop (i check my poop). I am not sure if it has always been there. This doesn't happen all the time but its does. 
Anyone experience this? Should i be worried? Do you think i need another colonoscopy? My anxiety off the hook.

"OMG, can anyone help? My poor bowel has gone back in to spasm, but nobody has suggested an antispasmodic, a liquid one. I am already taking Fybogel twice a day but only got told about this on Friday
Oh help, what on earth can i do or take, the doctor has suggested buscopan but their tablets, can you crush or get a liquid? This feels dreadful. My sister has panicked me today because she says i drink too little liquid. Do you know what fruit i could try as they were all pretty much stripped when i did the fodmap diet years back. I just want the pain to stop and my bowel not to hurt! Where would i get a liquid antispasmodic from? Boots?

"i have been told for 12 years i have IBS. The last few weeks though i have burning acidic pain in to my stomach up into my throat. I had got to the point where whatever antiacid i was taking wasn't working so i saw my doctor yesterday who put me on lansoprasole. But. (And it's a BIG but) i told her i had a gastroscope in 4 weeks time in hospital and from what i've read i can't have a proton pump inhibitor. Have i gone mad? Should she have given me this? I am awaiting her call back. I am NOT very pleased!

"So recently I’ve been feeling a small lump in my lower left abdomen. Around the belly button. And it causes me so much pain that I can’t breath or walk and I have to be laying down when it strikes. The thing is, is I can always feel it and it’s always there. But the pain isn’t quite so much, it’s more uncomfortable. But when it does become painful. It just strikes and it’s such an unbearable pain. That there has been times where I collapse to the ground because it hurts so much. And when I touch it to put pressure on it for relief. I can feel the bump. But when I talk to the doctors and they feel around my stomach they don’t feel anything. And I’ve had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done. And I’ve had x rays. And they said they still can’t see anything. So I don’t know what to think, or what it could be. But it hurts miserably. The doctors said its probably constipation. But I’m not constipated. My bowel movements are fairly normal and so is the consistency. And of course I still have my terrible IBS attacks and that’s when the bump in my stomach hurts the most. So what do guys think this is and what should I do?

"i forgot to mention when i posted the other day that when im not having diarrhoea , I often pass normal/ constipated pellet size stools but with like a ribbed texture on the outside of them - this has been happening for years ( i once had them tested for parasites as i thought it looked like little worms on the outside - but all negative) i know pencil thin stools are a worry but these arent thin they are just kind of lined ( sorry tmi) google seems to suggest its to do with the shape of the colon and the contractions due to ibs but im still abit worried - any one else get similar ?? thank you

"hi , i have had ibs symptoms for several years but only diagnosed properly a few years ago , i get flair ups with certain foods ( beans, sweetcorn, onions, tomatos, pizza, nuts etc ) - and when stressed , i used to get quite constipated but for a while i have started taking prunes to combat this - i have maybe 5/6 in the evening with some yogurt - but lately i have abdo pain and increased wind overnight which sometimes keep me awake farting !! followed by a loose bowel movement i the morning , if i dont take the prunes though i get constipated again ?? its a vicious circle - any advice please ? does it sound like the prunes causing the wind abdo pain and diarrhoea ?? after the early morning loose stool i normally dont go again - although occasionally do once or twice ??

"I started recently on Gabapentin to treat abdominal distension and pain from IBS-C. The doctor started me on a very low dose (50 mg), and now that I've been on it for 2 weeks, I'm increasing to 100 mg.
Has anyone used Gabapentin to treat abdominal distension and pain? If so, did it help? What dose were you on when it started to help? I've read that 200 mg is required to make a difference.
If your abdominal distension and pain were treated by some other medication, what was it, and did it work? The doctor, after prescribing Gabapentin, told me Cymbalta would be better and recommended I drop the Gabapentin and start Cymbalta. Cymbalta carries a risk of bringing back my old problem, Lymphocytic Colitis, so I'm hesitant to start it. Would love to hear from anyone with experience with these two problems and any treatment.
Thanks!

"Hi,
My dad is 69 yo and is suffering from the following symptoms:
-Lost 26kg in the last 2 years.
-Gets severely bloated and his abdomen cramps up immediately or 30 minutes after drinking water, chocolate, bread, red meat and most foods. It seems to be very random. Pain below stomach and small intestines. Sometimes gets bloated before even starting to eat. This has started 6 months ago and gotten progressively worse. This is our main concern because it saps all his strength and disables him to the point where he can't even lie down comfortably.
-The bloating, cramps and pain spikes up really quickly within a few minutes and then slowly drops off over a course of 2 to 4 hours. If he drinks water in that time it gets worse.
-Been diagnosed with parkinsons disease 2 weeks ago. However the parkinsons specialist says the bloating is a separate issue and cannot help.
-His prostate is 4 times larger than normal and that was found 3 weeks ago. He is taking medication for it now.
Extra information:
-We have given him soup and he doesn't seem to bloat from it.
-CT scan was done on his abdomen and nothing was found other than mild diverticuloses. I want to have a MRI done ASAP.
-He does not get nausea or have any blood in his stools.
-Needs to drink Movicol twice daily for his bowels to progress so that he can pass his stools otherwise his body simply does not do it. He once went 4 days without going to the toilet.
-Blood tests and heart pressure was done and everything is fine. He did have some low blood pressure once.
-Was tested for celiac or gluten intolerance and is fine.
I am trying to organize for him to see a Gastroenterology specialist ASAP.
I really would appreciate any help, recommendation or guess as to what could be happening thank you.

"So I was writing a comment on someone else's post today and wanted to share it with everyone on here.
I've had IBS all my life (I'm 29 now), or at least up until the last 6 months ago. No matter how much water/hydrational fluid I used to drink or the various different other diets/medication I tried, none of them worked beyond a bit of relief for a few weeks. On average, I used to have a poo about once every 2-3 days and had to sit on the toilet for 20+ minutes every time. I also got pain, cramps and bloating on a regular basis.
I didn't go vegan thinking it might help with my IBS, but I've been a vegan now for 6 months and it has almost completely cured it.
On average now, I'll have a poo twice a day and when I go, It comes out easily in 5 minutes or less. I get a lot less pain, stomach cramps and bloating since becoming a vegan as well.
Regardless of how you feel about vegans/veganism, I would recommend you giving it a try solely for the chance that it could cure or help with your IBS.

"I have had IBS-c practically all my life. Because of multiple diverticulosis and pain, I had sigmoid resection surgery five years ago. It did help quite a bit even though IBS and bad habits of colon are still with me. I was able to help my constipation problem by taking 6-8 ounces of diluted prune juice as first thing every morning. Believe me, it helped me a lot-more than a lot of high powered medicinal treatment. So constipation is being managed all right. Bloating and high level of colon discomfort/pain is still with me.
If others have gone through some similar experiences, it would be very helpful if you please share your story here. Thank you so much.

"Hi all, I've been trying to treat my ibs , and other health complaints including severe depression and anxiety, for many years, and it really seems like diet could be the answer. I could just do with a bit of advice from others who may have similar issues and experiences, as there is still so much uncertainty about whats helping or hindering.
I'll try and keep it brief - i get pain, wind, constipation and diarrhoea from eating a variety of foods - most severely from milk, wheat and alcohol - and i also get some other problems which may or may not be related, some a bit strange, such as anxiety, insomnia, sore eyes, skin complaints, joint problems (diagnosed hypermobility, pain,stiffness) and bleeding gums.
My gums have bled every day for years, but for some reason cutting out all grains stops this. Not sure why.
Cutting out dairy and grains has significantly reduced the diarrhea, but i eat extra fruit, veg, nuts and dried fruit and this gives me as much wind as ever, but helps to keep me from getting too constipated.
The skin seems to be improved by no grains or dairy.
I do in fact eat natural yoghurt, and i was told by a dietician that this should be ok as there is very little lactose in it. It sometimes seems to help the pain and constipation, but it might be adding to the wind - unsure about this.
Most meat and fish seem ok.
I've cut out eggs and nightshade veg and this seems to be a good thing, despite being extra hungry with so little left now!
OK, that wasnt as brief as i'd hoped, but i would like some opinions on this if possible.
It also could be useful to add that my concentration levels and memory have always been terrible, and i get hungry very quickly which exacerbates this. I experience light headedness, mild to moderate fatigue and some mild confusion.
I have experienced spells of better gut health and mental health while trying different restrictive diets, but it hasnt always been a hundred percent clear what i might have done right or wrong during these times.
i'm a 31 year old male from the UK. I work as a guitar teacher and support worker - just about hanging in there, with all these issues work is a trial!
Official diagnoses: IBS, anxiety disorder and depressive episodes, joint hypermobility, gilberts syndrome.
These issues have been present in worsening degrees since my teens - roughly 17 years.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"Hi all, I've been doing some reading, when you get constipated they say a good remedy is prunes this is because it contains sorbitol, the problem is sorbitol is not absorb very well and ends up in the large intestine where gut bacteria feast on it causing a huge amount of gas leading bloating and considerable discomfort, so in my case I won't be having any more prunes, I stepped eating them a couple of days ago and now have totally reduced the bloating, so what they might be good for you turns out a real problem, IBS is a right enigma, anyone else had trouble with prunes. ,

"Hello community,
Please read this letter and let me know your thoughts/experiences. There is a summary of symptoms at the end. So far the only thing the doctor has done is an endoscopy, and he prescribed Protonix. He did find an ulcer, but he did not find H. Pylori. Stool test from a different doctor also did not find H. Pylori.
His condition causes him to lash out frequently and very irrationally toward myself and my almost 4 year old daughter. This causes many tears. He generally had a sweet and loving temperament before (although he is mildly on the autism spectrum). He does not do any drugs and has stopped even occasional alcohol since it is a trigger for him. He does have clear days or parts of days where he realizes he needs help and that he is unwell. He feels badly for how he has acted afterwards, but he is not able to show he is sorry with actions because he is too fatigued/foggy.
I am due to have a baby in two months, and I am very afraid to spend my postpartum in this toxic environment. I want my sweet and loving husband back, and I don't know how long I should wait for him. In the back of my mind I know I will have to leave him if he cannot get well, because I am not willing to raise my children in this environment.
What I wrote to his doctor:
The heartburn and ulcer is only one of many problems. His condition is very serious and we are willing to try absolutely anything at this point.
We need a doctor who is going to take this seriously and be willing to try things, because not doing anything is not an option for us.
This condition is affecting his personality and causing memory loss. He is having extreme fatigue and extreme mood swings. He is not under any external stress, but regardless, he will suddenly become enraged and cannot cope with everyday tasks. He was never like this before.
When he has a ""flare up"" he feels pressure in his head and red marks appear on his face. His face will appear puffy and he will smell strongly like garbage or rotten sausages during these times.
He also becomes bloated and has very foul smelling, loose bowel movements. Often it is explosive diarrhea.
He also gets insomnia with all these other symptoms.
To summarize:
Symptoms:
personality changes
memory loss
mood swings and fits of unprovoked rage
pressure and puffiness of head and face that lasts usually a day or two
red marks like line shaped bruises appear when face is puffy
extreme fatigue
brain fog, inability to think clearly, inability to make good decisions
emitting strong smells of garbage/rotten sausages
bloating
foul smelling bowel movements
explosive diarrhea
insomnia
frequent burps
heartburn
Known Triggers:
Beer
any alcohol
sweets or pastries
refined carbs or sugars
Halal kebab food
cured meats
sleep deprivation
Possible Conditions:
leaky gut
imbalance of gut bacteria with or without candida overgrowth
liver issue?
other infections?
possibility of multiple underlying causes?
I cannot stress enough how severe this issue is for my husband and our family. We are desperate!!!! Please help him!

"I had a colonoscopy one year ago [march 2018 to be exact]. I had it because i had a bout of constipation and i had rectal bleeding. Around that time, i had lost a friend to colon cancer so my anxiety went off the hook. I went to a doctor who did a DRE and said i had an anal fissure. But since this incident, my bowels never stayed the same. I had frequent bowel movements i.e -3-4 a day. This i still experience to date. I started experiencing mucus in stools. I went to see a gastroentrologist and pushed for a colonoscopy. It came back clear no polyps, no hemorrhoids. My bowels pretty went back to normal with no mucus and no blood apart from two incidents where i was passing large stools that came with a streak of blood but nothing alarming. My worry was the continued frequent bowel movements [3-4 a day]. Yesterday, i had a bit of abdominal discomfort, bloating and i was passing relatively normal stool only that this time, it came with mucus. Globs of white mucus.
I am now getting worried. Could something else be going on, why is it that my bowels never went back to what they were, could the colonoscopy have missed something, should i push for another one again,

"I don't normally post on these sorts of sites/forums but I'm pretty much out of options at this point. I've been to over 20+ doctors in the past 6 years and all of them have just given me things to mask my symptoms.
In the Fall of 2012 I started having a strange pain below my left rib. I went to a doctor and they told me I had GERD and gave me some medication but it never did anything that helped. Over the course of several months I developed more symptoms including TMJ, tension headaches, and swollen sinuses. I went to another doctor for the TMJ and headaches and they said they it was caused by anxiety (I had just started going to college at this point and I was pretty on edge so I believed them). I went to an ENT doctor and they looked through my sinuses and found nothing. These symptoms never went away.
In 2016 I went to a chiropractor for my TMJ and he adjusted and stretched my jaw muscles. The next day I felt amazing, all of my symptoms had gone away and I thought that was it. After a couple of days all of my symptoms came back and nothing the chiropractor did ever helped again. This has happened several times. I will find something that fixes all of my symptoms for one day, and then they all come back and what I did to fix them the first time never works again. I'll list everything I've done to fix it here:
The first time I drank a lot of alcohol, the next day I actually felt amazing.
Stretching chest muscles with a foam roller
Stretching Hip flexor muscles
Flexeril for a short time
Xanax
Stretching Jaw Muscles
In 2017 I saw a TMJ specialist who made me a special appliance to help with my TMJ. It worked for about a week and then all of my symptoms came back. In the fall of 2017, one night I was trying to relieve my TMJ pain by stretching my jaw muscles before I went to sleep. In the morning my left ear was ringing like crazy and I couldn't hear well out of it. I went to an ENT and found out that I inexplicably lost the high frequency hearing in my left ear. I had an MRI taken of my head to make sure it wasn't caused by a tumor and they didn't find anything. I noticed that every single time I went to a doctor my blood pressure was high and they just kind of ignored it. I went to a doctor specifically for my blood pressure and they officially diagnosed me with high blood pressure. I'm a 25 year old male who exercises regularly, and eats fairly decently. I should not have high blood pressure.
This is where my symptoms all come back to abdominal pain. That slight pain under my left rib never really went away, I just got used to it because doctors always told me it was from GERD. One day I was sitting in a bean bag chair watching a movie and that spot under my rib made a crazy noise, I could feel it gurgling, and my stomach growled as if I was hungry. ALL of my symptoms immediately went away, but again it only lasted for one day. I told my doctor and they said they had no idea what that could be. I've told this to every doctor I've seen since and they all have no idea what I'm talking about and sort of avoid the subject This has happened a few times now. The first time I ever used Xanax, my abdomen made this same noise and all of my symptoms went away. A few weeks ago I was sitting in a weird position on a chair and it happened again. Same thing, I felt great for one day, and then it never worked again.
Recently I've been going to a chiropractor who is trying to help me with natural treatments. They said that I had a hiatal hernia, and I thought that was the cause of the abdominal pain but after they fixed it, I still have all of the same symptoms. They've done blood work and a food sensitivity test. I've taken all of the foods that I'm sensitive to out of my diet. My blood works shows that my body is trying to fight something off but it doesn't really show what it could be.
I'm convinced that all of my symptoms have something to do with this strange pain in my abdomen that doctors seem to just want to ignore. It's the very first symptom I ever had and when I feel it growl/gurgle, all of my other symptoms including my TMJ, go away.
Does anyone know what the heck it could possibly be? Could IBS cause all of this?

could Aerophagia be the reason people are suffering from IBS. Having read about it it can be caused by Depression .
But what comes first , surly people would get depressed if constantly in pain . loose dentures ,bad teeth, not chewing food properly, gulping down food, talking with there mouth full. all causing Bad Wind . plus amylase, lipase. the digestive enzymes in the mouth to aid with digestion , then constipation or diarrhea,
then on top of all that pain killers. indigestion remedies . to which makes it all worse , hemorrhoids ,altered bowel movements, gallbladder working overtime trying to aid with digestion with bile.
Simple cure maybe not . but might be a help . just to look how people eat . just me but i think it is Wind in Stomach that moves around the stomach that causes the pain , right side ,left side, bottom of stomach .top belly.
plus a lot of medication people take for other illness. Aspirin a big one. plus many more .

"Occasionally, like 1-3 times a week, I'll get a sudden sharp pain under my left rib (more toward back and flank) that comes and goes within 5-10 seconds. It seems to get better when I can take a deep breath in and expand my chest...but it hurts like a mother until then! It's almost like a cramp of sorts...but sharp. Anyone have this with IBS? Trying to figure out if its IBS or GERD related.

"Back in 2017 I had posted on this forum regarding some symptoms I had been having for a while which consisted primarily of abdominal pains and stool inconsistencies. My doctor had me do a barium enema and CEA test which was all normal. I also followed up with a visit to the GI specialist which did other blood tests and a test for h pylori (all negative).
Convinced it was really IBS I let it rest. Now late last year (November) I went to the bathroom and saw alot of blood on the toilet paper after passing stool. I did feel like something hard was passed out. I went to my GP which examined me and said he didnt see a tear and it could be an internal hemorrhoid.
I still have abdominal discomfort and my stool does seem to still be inconsistent. I have noticed what seems to be light red streaks in my stool but nothing bright red. I can't really identify anything in my diet which could be causing this. Needless to say, I'm yet again very much worried.
All this concern come about especially because I now know through research that barium enemas are not as effective as colonoscopies at identifying the ""bad stuff"". I want a colonoscopy but need to schedule another appointment with the GI and then I'll need to get the funds together as its alot more expensive. All this has me constantly concerned. Wanted to reach out to the community for some thoughts.

"i had steak and prawns 4 years ago not knowing my symptoms of IBS! ( full meal )
i suffered a terrible pain from my anus going upwards throughout the whole night, lying down in bed i thought would help me, it would get worse.
i took pain killers yet it would not change, i suffered beyond anyone would know. i stopped eating prawns and steak since then.
today after 4 years i thought let me try eating again since i am on medication anyway i had only 2 prawns at lunch and within 4 hours i felt the same pain from anus going up but not as bad as i had 4 years ago.
has anyone experienced this?

"Hi all
So I'm in desperate need of some advice please about IBS and how to control it. I've had it for many years now, and I've always managed to deal with it and still live a normal life, but these past few months I've been struggling like mad. I've always had a good relationship with food, and I knew what foods to avoid but now it seems like whatever I eat will make me bloated and nauseous, to the point where I'm scared to eat. I've lost over 3 stone in a few months because of this (which isn't necessarily a bad thing as I will admit I was a little overweight before but it's unintentional weight loss and even when I've been on diets in the past I've never lost it this quickly). I've tried cutting out gluten, dairy, low-FODMAP, low carbs, but nothing seems to make a difference. I've also been getting this horrendous lower bowel pain, which are slightly different to my normal stomach cramps (usually, mine are higher up). It feels like someone is stabbing me, and it makes it really hard to go about everyday life. I've tried taking anti-spasmodic drugs but they don't seem to really help. And something that's been worrying me the most is I've been bleeding from the back passage. I've had exams done and the doctor couldn't find any piles or anything, so this has been really worrying. I've been to a specialist and am getting tests done, but he said it's most likely just IBS. I'm just terrified they're gonna send me away and not offer me any help, which is what all the doctors in the past have done after giving me the old 'it's just IBS'. This is seriously affecting my life at this point, I am constantly feeling unwell, I don't really go out anymore. I'm nearly 20 years old and in university, but I don't feel like I am. My stomach dictates my life, and what I do, and I'm really sick of it. It doesn't help that I have a severe phobia of vomiting as well, so obviously feeling nauseous 24/7 is very stressful. I know your mental state can affect IBS, and I've been to multiple psychs (as I also have depression and anxiety) but this change, this pain and the bleeding is just on a whole other level.
I'm just looking for some advice really on what I can do to ease this a little bit, whether anyone here knows of any different diets or medications that have helped them in the past. At this point, I am willing to try anything.

"Around two this afternoon I got the strangest cramps. I felt them everywhere, not just in my stomach or abdomen but in my rectum too, and they were the most terrible cramps I've ever felt. They've been persisting intermittently for almost 12 hours (it's now 1:00AM). They feel better when I pass gas, but I haven't been able to go to the bathroom because it hurts too much. I woke up around midnight and tried to go to the bathroom but just got nauseas and shivery (might be from anxiety too). I've been snacking on prunes and water since then, but am very nervous. I've never had trouble like this before.
Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms- I know all are common with IBS, just not for me or at least not to this extent.

"Hi,
I tend to get symptom flare ups when I'm anxious and the past 4/5 months my mental health has been awful. I can usually tell when symptoms are flaring because of anxiety though and this feels different.
I recently changed my diet a bit. Ive never had a good diet - no fruit/veg and pretty much the same meals daily for my whole life because I'm so picky. I have been trying to eat veg but I'm struggling with that because it makes me heave so have been having a lot of fruit instead. This means Ive cut back on my junk food a lot, I'm now only having about 1 thing a day.
For days now Ive had horrific cramps and I feel like someones twisting my insides. And then at night time I have awful diarrhoea and terrible nausea. My mum said it may be due to my diet changing and my body needs to adjust but its making me feel so ill. The reason I decided to change my diet is because I dropped out of college 4 months ago and I don't leave the house other than for appointments so I'm terrified of gaining weight; I haven't gained wait in a long time but since Ive cut out my college walk, I no longer get any exercise.. I didn't get much anyway because of chronic pain and other physical health stuff but Ive never put on an weight and it was enough to give me enough muscle to help stop dislocations.
My question is if this could be due to my diet changing, I never experience symptoms this bad... and if my body will adjust to it soon, as its horrific and I'm not sure what to do.

"So I posted last year when I was having issues, but can't seem to find my post now. Of course, its been a year, so I can't remember the symptoms I was having at the time either. I've been doing my best not to get anxious about my symptoms, and this always seems to help...so here I am!
I noticed about a week ago, my BMs went from loose to larger and slower to pass. I was still passing daily, but not as much as usual when i have loose stools. Then, this last Monday, I woke up with back pain that started in my lower back, but then progressed up my left flank and into my upper back by the middle of the day. My back almost feels ""out"", but I know its not...just had an adjustment. My back and flank muscles feel sore like the day after a major workout and they feel strained when I try to stretch them out. In the mean time, I've been trying to have a BM, but still don't feel totally empty. Feels better in my back for a bit after emptying some though...but comes right back after eating. Anyway, I keep second guessing myself whether this is IBS because despite the fact I've never really had back issues (at least not like this), this feels so close to what i would think a ""back issue"" would be like. But...then it comes and goes throughout the day depending on whether i have eaten or evacuated my bowels or whatever. Anyone else experience this? I really need to write these symptoms down so I'm not freakin' myself out each time this happens!

"I have had diarrhea every day since the end of November and nothing is working. I have tried everything you can think of. I’m not kidding. This constant diarrhea has definitely lasted longer than 4 weeks and now going on week 6. I’m starting to think I have chronic diarrhea rather that just acute diarrhea. I have severe ibs so this is making my symptoms worse. And it’s getting to the point that this is unbearable and uncomfortable. I’m going to doctors at the end of January, so we can see what’s wrong and why I have had this for this long. Even water makes my diarrhea worse. No meds or anything works and the diarrhea just keeps coming and I’m so tired and weak. So I’m like either dehydrated or have even worse diarrhea. So what do you guys think? I also can’t digest foods now anymore. I see it in my stools and sometimes I see black in my stool. And after the 3rd of week this diarrhea I saw some blood in my stool. I don’t notice blood at the moment but it’s still concerning. This isn’t normal at all right?

"I've had IBS with diarrhea and constipation for the past 10 years and it has definitely gotten worse over time. All tests have come back clear and just got left with leaky gut, candida, and functional dyspepsia. My diet is very bland, can't eat too many fruits or veggies. I've been gluten and dairy free for almost a year. I've been noticing that every 3 or 4 weeks I've been having stomach flu symptoms. Random watery diarrhea out of nowhere, nauseous, weak, exhausted. Mucus in stool. The diarrhea lasts for a couple days but the sick feeling lingers for like a week. This is not my typical IBS as I've controlled this type of diarrhea with probiotics. I'm wondering if anyone has suffered with this? I think maybe I came down with a bug, but then realize I cannot keep getting stomach bugs every couple weeks.

Crap with them. Finished them yesterday and today felt so ill on waking - have felt all week like I've got another bug loosish stools inflamed feeling in the stomach and my bowel feels open or inflamed.
I'm hoping I feel this way because I also have started getting sinus and ear congestion which I read last night can make you feel nauseaous.
Throughout my 7 months I hardly ever had nausea with the ibs so this is really upsetting me - I was told after the flagyl if it didn't work I'd have to just stay on the fodmap diet and normafibre.
I just feel so down - thought having the procedure and nothing sinister to report I'd start dealing with it but now this has upset me so much
Have I opened up another can of worms having the procedure?
Did anyone get sick like this after their procedure and will it settle down?

"I've had a tight feeling about two inches to the left of my belly button for 4 months. It's not an unbearable pain but it's always there and it's hard not to let it get me down. Certain movements seem to make it worse. Standing up straight or making small movements such as when cooking are when it's worst. It's not so bad when I'm walking fast, sitting or lying down - it's still there but more vague.
I've had blood tests and yesterday had a colonoscopy which was clear. I'm relieved but just want to know what it is so I know what to do about it. It doesn't seem to be related to food. I experienced a few months of loose stools which resolved, but then this pain started. It's like there's a knot to the left of my belly button. It's not so bad when I first get up in the morning, then it gradually gets worse as the day goes on.
My doctor says it's irritable bowel syndrome, but I'm not sure. Has anyone else experienced this?

"Hi All
Just after some fellow IBS sufferers experiences during a flare up to compare with my latest flare up, which was quite a bad one for me. For your information I suffer with IBS-A (alternating) but I generally suffer more with IBS-C symptoms, although I generally feel worse when I experience bouts of IBS-D.
My latest flare up started Wednesday evening and only now do I feel like I'm starting to get back to normal, so that makes a total of about 3 days. My flare ups tend to last anywhere between 3 to 10 days, so the length of time this latest one has gone on for seems quite normal for me, I'm wondering if this sounds like a normal length of time to experience a flare up?
The more worrying issue is how my flare ups actually make me feel. When they hit the reaction is usually quite quick to come on, I get very bloated and burp a lot, I also get a lot of sharp, random abdominal and chest pains and cramping. I also get this lump feeling in my throat and I physically feel like I'm struggling to draw breath. My heart rate tends to increase, and I also get this dizzy, lightheaded, wobbly feeling come over me in waves, I also feel like I could just fall asleep at any moment. My flare ups really do make me feel really unwell, and at points very worried. I'd be very grateful to hear experiences of others IBS flare ups, and to hear whether the symptoms I experience are likely to be the result of my IBS flare ups?
Many thanks in advance.

"Hey Everyone,
By process of elimination (had every blood test, stool test, tube stuck up and down me & scans besides a capsule endoscopy) doctors have diagnosed me with severe irritable bowel syndrome. I am a 34 year old male and it's hard to believe this is actually IBS due to the severity of my symptoms.
The most disturbing symptoms are chronic intestinal noises (swooshing, popping and gurgling non-stop), sulphur burps from time to time and diarrhea that can become pure liquid & is not the ""one and done"" style but I keep going every couple of minutes so severely that it takes me at times a overdose (8+) of Imodium combined with Lomotil and Anti-Spasmodics medications to stop it, it also smells quite horrific and has a yellow tinge to it. For those who suffer with chronic diarrhea as a symptom of your IBS how severe can it get for you & how long does it last? and do you have tips of strategies to normalize your bowel movements that have worked in order to be able to live a semi-normal life. Ive tried almost every technique and medication, FODMAP diet, Dycyclomine (anti spasmodics), Imodium, Lomotil, Anti-Depressants, Calcium Supplements, bile acid medications, and none seem to be a permanent fix to this ongoing problem that has controlled my life now for 2+ years.
Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

"Basically, I've seen a lot of posts where people talk about IBS or stomach/gut/health problems but never mention their water/hydrational fluid intake per day. Delving further into nutritionists' guidance, they'll commonly say you should drink 2-3L of water/hydrational fluid per day, but I'm interested to see what other people on here drink and whether they find increasing or decreasing this amount makes a difference to their health/bowel movements etc. (Note, when I say hyrdrational fluids, I mean stuff that isn't water, but isn't coke or coffee. Examples of this would be fruit juice, herbal teas, squash etc.)
As a starting point, about a year ago I was drinking about 1.2L of hydrational fluid a day, but about 2-3 months ago, I was advised to start taking supplements for CFS by a nutritionist, so I thought it'd be a good idea to up my fluid intake as well. Since then I've been drinking about 1.9L per day and have found that I generally feel a bit more alert/have less brain fog.

"Hi guys, new here.
I wanted to share my story and found this forum, from reading through some of the posts I can see I am in the right place and definitely not alone! I've been having a flare up now for about 3 weeks and my main symptom is the gurgling of the stomach... or bubbling..or as another poster put it is the mouse running around in there. I occasionally get diarrhea but mainly the way it manifests in me is the opposite - the feeling of needing to go, not being able to or just a small amount, repeat x 5, or more. At it's worst it makes me feel sick with burping. Sometimes I get stabbing pains that are extremely painful, like someone sticking a pin in my guts, but as quick as it comes it goes again. Gas is an issue. It can cause me to wince with pain temporarily and its gone again.
It's my belief that the symptoms are not caused by diet in my case, as I have had many months in a row with no symptoms. I do believe there is a link with stress, but this is hard as sometimes it can take the symptoms for me to realise that I might be stressed, I'm not 100% this is an exact science.
For context I'm male and 37 years old, and first had symptoms about in about 2011. I remember I got the stomach flu, which the first time I had really had a major stomach issue that lasted beyond a couple of days. I'm a runner and have got more into running this past two years, which I believe has helped with my symptoms as I have seen a decrease, but this past three weeks it has prevented me from going out on many occasions. I run with a club, and the gas issue combined with feeling sick has put the brakes on for me.
I just wanted to highlight that I definitely believe this most recent flare up has been potentially caused by stress and the mental impact this has had on me. Not being able to go out running has meant I've felt sluggish, it's a vicious circle as this then makes me feel more stressed/ down. I know that if I can go for a run I will probably feel better, but I've had a this past week to compound things (when your body is down, it's down right?) . I'm personally a bit fed up of the symptoms and the constant stomach churning and when it's there it's hard to shake off my mind. I know others here will relate to this, it will be good to hear some other opinions. I find it hard to talk my wife about as I feel like I'm moaning and don't want to bring her down, I am an extremely positive person generally and this is the major blip on my health CV.

"Hi I have been diagnosed with IBS and would like to share my symptoms to see if anyone else has the same and how do they cope.
I think my IBS is bought on by stress. I know if i have an important meeting or am travelling with work i get bouts on diarrhoea and my stomach swells and cramps. I know it is stress because once i have the meeting or arrive after travelling the symptoms miraculously disappear. Over the years this has got worse with even a visit to the hospital brings on a flare up. Think i worry to much that i will get a flare up so it is a self fulfilling prophecy.
I have heard that maybe you can get a small dose of an anti depressant and this may help.
Does anyone have experience with the same symptoms and how do you control this as it is beginning to take over my life.

"hi all,

ive had a recent flair up and this time ive had a new symptom. Today i've been feeling a little more acidic than usual. i also feel as though something is stuck in my throat. has anyone else had this before? i can eat okay but it feels like something is lodged there. i have also been taking Omeprazole if that changes anything.

"Hey everyone, it was only a few days i started getting serious gas stomach pains, which would continue to come and go, move around my stomach like cramps, and I could feel the remains and know it was still there whilst touching my stomach, with a mix of diarrhea, small and hard stools.
Before this, I would have minor bouts of diarrhea, and it would go in a day, now this has continued for three days, and you know I dont care anymore, im used to it, and its sad but i got hope it will go away again (hopefully not in a year again lol), but yeah of theres any suggestions would be kind, but i have tried nearly everything to put it away a year ago, and i didnt know what did the trick. But all good if not. Im 18 and other symptoms include:
chest pain (after ibs ended) and phelgm sounds in chest
stomach sounds, movement (cramps)
feels in remission when Im asleep (or just wake up)
painful lol
thanks

"My stomach issues from ibs are getting worse! I don’t know what to do! In all honesty. I feel fine when I’m not eating. But as soon as any sort of food enters into my stomach. I am always so sick! It doesn’t matter what food is being put inside me. I will always feel sick, I’ve even been following the fodmap diet and I have tried so many different kinds of medicines and none of them have worked. It doesn’t matter if the food I’m eating is healthy or not I will always feel sick, bloated, constipated, or feel like I have diarrhea. And I am in so much pain and nothing is working and I feel like food is just making it worse for me and I don’t know what to do. I don’t ever wanna eat, so I’m just eating like small things like a banana or a protein bar and that’s all I eat. But then I only eat a little, I’m still in pain and I feel like I’m gonna vomit. I’m headed to the doctors soon hopefully this month or next month. So is there anything I can ask my doctor that I can do different. Or different ways of eating where I won’t get sick and I can maintain a healthy weight. I was wondering if a feeding tube would work, and if people with ibs have actually ever used a feeding tube? Is that something I could ask my doctor or he’d recommend for me? I just don’t wanna eat anymore. Ever! I have a friend who needs to use a feeding tube. Because she can’t digest and absorb nutrients like me.

I am hoping this is over but now I am back to constipated after diarrhea for a week. When do the bowels return to normal or is this going to be there forever?

"Hi everyone, it must of been a month or two now I went to visit my doctors as after I have had food I feel pretty bloated and sometimes i am finding I have lots of wind which is hot and very smelly. 
When I visited the doctor, their thoughts was it was a combination of constipation and IBS. I’ve never been aware I have had IBS. I am a 21 year old male. I have just started to get back in to gym. The only thing I could think of is that I eat pretty fast. Any answers or guidance would be highly appreciated.
Many thanks

"I downloaded the app for the fodmap diet. I went through the list of what I have been eating to see what may be causing me problems. This morning I decided to eat breakfast foods as singles and then wait an hr after each to see how belly responded. Oatmeal - fine, eggs - fine, low fat yogurt - tummy grumbling and pinch of pain in back. I was eating yogurt to calm acid in stomach since I have some issues with that currently.
Now would my body react to the food right away or am I going about this all wrong? I did not want my breakfast all at once because then I would not know what is causing me problems so I just spaced everything.

Any suggestions or resources? Like for example this site that I found really helpful with great low FODMAP recipes https://casadesante.com/blogs/low-fodmap-meal-plans-low-fodmap-recipes I also tried following their meal plans. So far so good!

"I am waiting to get a CT scan to rule out something sinister before moving onto possibly more tests to get a diagnosis. Doc says I have symptoms of IBS but there are a few things I am dealing with that do not show up under any IBS forum comments or info. Anemia - doc thinks it is because I have very heavy menses since the numbers go up and down. Burning stomach and acid reflux. I have been told I have GERD by one doc a yr ago but now that has changed to gastritis or ulcer depending on who I speak to and the omeprazole and sulcrafate seem to be making me sick (dizzy, short of breath, shaky, anxious) but when I stop taking them the stomach burn returns vicious. It also radiates to my middle back. (pancreas and liver tests can back normal).
My other odd one is that food seems to be going right through me. What I hate before 6 pm yesterday came out as mushy poo today. Does anyone on her with IBS have that happen? When I wake up in morning my stomach is so empty. Last night it was empty and bothering me so I ate a banana at 12 pm and paid the price. Had pain under right rib that finally went away with bm this morning. Do any of you digest food this fast?
I have lost a ton of weight because I lost most of my appetite and also afraid to eat because I don't know what will set off stomach burn or stomach pain. I cannot stop thinking this is stomach or colon cancer. I know no one can tell me it isn't, I just feel so unwell. Not just the abdomen pain that moves around or the mushy stools alternating with the straining to get it out, I feel sick. Is it normal to FEEL so sick ith IBS? I don't even leave the house anymore.

"Back in Oct around ovulatio I was woken up
at 3 am with extreme nausea followed by severe stomach burning. Thought it was stomach flu. Nausea left within minutes but burning stayed. Over 3 days it was on and off w/wave of nausea followed by burning. Yogurt or food would calm the burn. I was severely bloated and passing gas like never before in my life. Suddenly I started getting stabbing pains over right ovary and that evolved into radiating pain to thigh, back, under rib. This also includes constipation with weird soft bms (when I strain to get it out). Then pain started in left ovary. I was certain it was ovarian cysts but I had pelvic ultrasound (internal and external) and the report says everything is normal. No fibroids and no cysts. Yet my gyno said she felt something during pelvic exam. As my menstrual cycle was coming to an end I had less bloat but intermittent pain still present. 2 days after that the pain is less (mainly in hip) but now the bloat is back. Doc says we can do colonoscopy as a next step. He gave me a med to clear out colon to see if it helps.
Does this sound at all like IBS to anyone or should I be looking at something else? I have no idea what to do. It all hit so suddenly.

"My doc and I are back to trying to figure out if what I truly have is IBS. Developing a burning stomach that radiates to back threw him off. I am waiting on test results for pancreatitis and liver function. He feels the radiating to back sounds the pancreas but I saw a diff doc today since he was out and she thinks ulcer and she thinks if we can cure ulcer then it may improve other symptoms like the pain moving all over and the constipation that magically turned into diarrhea for a hot second today. Back to constipation now.
Here's the thing, the burning pain is worse with movement. Yet I went to gym today and did elliptical for 25 minutes and it helped keep burn in stomach and mid back pain away. But it got bad again hour later and stayed through night even after taking med to sooth stomach. On day two of omeprazole and that is not doing anything.
When I sit and drive car I noticed burn radiating to mid back is also worse. Does and did anyone else experience this with IBS? Did movement make abdomen pain worse?

"Hi all,
For the past 7 months i have been having severe abdominal pain, very loose stools, bloating, heart burn a sense if immediate fullness even after eating small portions and very bad groin, hip and low back pain, i also have bladder sensitivity and feel like my bladder us extremely full. M pain is mostly on the right side and is continuous. I have had all kinds of blood related tests, been also testes for celiac and other food allergies, had a CT scan as well as xrays, been teated for helicobacter pylori and all results came back negative. Next Saturday i am scheduled for a colonoscopy. The pain is so debilitating that i have convinced myself that its must be something more serious that the doctors are missing out! my insides feel so sore and at times it feels like my abdomin is twitching like a muscle would. It would be so helpful if I could receive any feedback from anyone who has experienced anything similar. I'm finding it so hard to believe this is IBS as my doctors and gastroenterologist are suggesting.
Please help!!

"I had posted a week or more ago about some symptoms I was having that came on rather suddenly. I originally thought it could be an ovarian cysts but tests rules that out. Now I am so suppose to see the doctor tomorrow to discuss further testing but today almost all of the symptoms are gone. Each day since I last posted things have improved. Stomach burning is down to almost non existent, the pain in abdomen is pretty much gone except for last night it returned following an anxiety attack along with back pain and then later I had only one twinge in night, no bloat. Prior to this the pain was bouncing from lower right abdomen to side to back to under right rib., to hip. The only thing hanging on now is the inability to have a bowel movement without straining and stool is still not my normal appearance. 99% of pain is gone, the bloat is gone, the gnawing stomach is gone.
I lost a lot of weight through this but I can't tell if it is from my anxiety disorder causing a loss of appetite or something else.
My question: would you still go through the tests to eliminate other issues or would you wait and see if this problem I had happens again?
Would IBS do this...appear suddenly and then slowly disappear?

"What probiotic brands do you trust? Do you ever change strains?
I've been using Culturelle as recommended by my GI, but I notice that it only has 1 strand of lactobacillus GG so I added Rainbow Light ProbioActive which has Bacillus coaguluns- I believe that strand helps with diarrhea which my IBS has switched to lately. I've also been thinking of switching to Garden of Life Once Daily Women’s Probiotics- which apparently has 16 strands and 50 billion cfu- when I run out of both the Culturelle and Rainbow Light.
Although, I am also curious if anyone takes Heather's Tummy Fiber which is prebiotic acacia, and/or Garden of Life chocolate plant protein which has 2 billion cfu of bifidoacterium lactis Bl-04. I am a little concerned that I might take too many probiotics if I take both the Garden of Life protein and probiotic supplements.

"I know this is probably silly but I wonder if someone can shed light on the matter.  In the past I used tap water enemas to relieve  constipation.  From time to time, it seemed the water would go up and get stuck.  It almost seemed like there was a door that could open to let stuff in and then  close and not let stuff out- I know this is a very poor analogy but it's the best way I can describe the feeling.  
I also feel like this happens with gas too where the gas is right there but something internally blocks it from coming out and no matter how bloated and distended you are it won't release.  
Or if I get the feeling I have to pass gas but the timing is not appropriate.  However when I finally get to somewhere private the gas won't come out, like you know you have to and it was ready a minute ago but it went back in and now you are in pain from it.  
Again I know this sounds silly but I feel like whatever this is, is a big contributing factor to my problems.  
Any information would be appreciated.

"I was dealing with some constipation issues and took Milk of Magnesia, after having tried a couple handful of prunes and my normal fiber/water dosages. I took the standard 30ml dose of MoM before bed. Despite terrible stomach cramps in the night, eight hours later it still hadn't worked. So I took another15ml- the max does in 24hrs is 60ml. That worked within about ten minutes, but the whole day after that was absolutely terrible!! The following day (yesterday) things seemed to have gone a complete 180. I was able to pass some very small movements that were about a 6 on the scale. Today has been even less, but still a 6 and some pushing to get even that out. I've taken about half as many prunes as I did the day before yesterday, half my normal amount of fiber- and plan on increasing that a bit tonigt, my normal probiotic- a strain of Lactobicilicus that I forget, and another strain of probiotic.
Also I've had lots of gas and cramping this past week.
Even though I technically have passed something over the last 48rs it's not much and I'm on the fence about taking some more MoM, or Dulcolax even, tonight...

It says to take 20 min. before eating. Yesterday I forgot to take one before supper, then had diahrreah so took one before going to bed.
Would it be ok to stop taking it now and only take it when it comes?
The doctor did say to keep taking it, but when the symptoms dissapear stop, if they come back again take it.

"Hello all,
When I was 16 or 17, I suffered extreme trauma to my back passage, it was bleeding for three whole days, out of three different parts.
Here’s how it happened, I was sitting on the wheel arch in the back of a Van, we were going fast and the driver slammed on his breaks making half my body to move forward and the other half to stay where it was, right away I knew something was wrong, I felt a sharp pain about 1 inch below my belly button but right deep inside me . The bleeding started almost right away (this was on Friday about 7 am) by Saturday, the bleeding was worst, and there was an awful smell.
Me thinking that the smell was just the blood, I didn’t go to the A&E or a GP (the smell wasn’t their b4) after Sunday the blood cleared up, but the smell was still there, and even today, after all these years the smell is still there.
Now, let me tell you that I have a shower every day, clean down there in the shower and after I go to the toilet, making sure there nothing down there which shouldn’t be, I still can't get rid of the smell, so pretty much since I've had this Trauma, all I have managed to wear is Jeans, its the only thing which can keep the smell in, and have had next to no exercise.
There also something else it happened down there during the Trauma, so I thought it was just the blood. Every time I need the toilet, it starts to sweat extremely usually (down there), so bad that it makes sweat marks in my boxers, and if I wear light trousers (like combats/cargo pants) the sweat goes right through (that’s another reason why I can only wear jeans) and that’s when the smell starts EVEN although there nothing down there which shouldn’t be.
I've been in and out of Hospital for the past couple of years getting all types of operations done and seen GI nurses and specialist, but no one can seem to find anything wrong.
Here is a couple of pictures of what its like when I need to toilet and how much I leak, although they can't seem to find anything wrong, after one operation the leaking isn't as bad as the photos now, but still leaking and the smell is still there.

"Hi, I’ve been suffering with IBS for a few years now (more so now than then) I have an hours drive in the mornings, I try to use the loo in the mornings but never much luck - 10/15 minutes into my journeys I’m in trouble and need to go. Sometimes I need to stop 2 or 3 times which is embarissing as the choice of toilet isn’t always great. I’ve tried seratine to see if it was nervous belly but that didn’t work? I’ve cut out nearly all dairy from my diet but doesn’t seem to be helping .. it flares up and goes away for weeks, but comes back with a vengeance! Any help would be great

"I am a 63 year old female and over the last 6 months or so have been getting a lot of constipation, a nauseous feeling that seems to originate from just beneath the rib cage in the middle. Sometimes it feels like this slight nauseous feeling goes right up to my throat. When the symptoms are present I feel very tired, have no energy and feel as if I am just about functioning.
I used to get these symptons maybe once every other month but lately they have been increasing and I now get them for days at a time followed by days of feeling ok.
I eat normally and havent lost weight.
I have visited my GP who has given me Mebverine tablets to try but the literature he gave me to read says further investigation is needed for these type of symptoms over age 60 as IBS does not normally begin at my age. One of the tests is for ovarian cancer.
Do you think I should push for further investigation as the GP thinks it is IBS?

"37 y/o M. Generally fit and healthy (running, general gym exercise, etc). 
So here is what I'm experiencing (slowly gotten worse over 1.5-2 years) - any advice would be welcome. 
When I get up in a morning, after around 5-20 minutes of pottering around the house I have a sudden urge to go for a BM (bowel movement). It's normally always extrmemely loose or only parlty formed stool. 
After a dash to the loo I have a forceful BM where I feel the stool exiting quickly....before it suddenly stops. I know there is more to come out but it just completley halts. I don't wish to strain (I've had a haemorroihds removed before) so I have to begin cleaning up. 
After cleaning up (which can take a while!) I continue with my morning; feeling full, uncomfortable, feeling a bit dirty and unclean and sometimes lethargic. Luckily I spend a fair amount of time at home with my job but it does sometimes kill my drive and enthusiasm.
Then, after varying times, sometimes a few minutes, sometimes 30 minutes, sometimes an hour, I have another urge (not as strong as the first) for another BM, which is obviously the 'left over' from the initial toilet trip. 
The second time is normally a lot easier to clean up and is a little more solid (still not sausage shaped, though) and leaves me feeling completley empty with a spring in my step. Sometimes I have to go 3 times, but normally twice does the job.
This can sometimes happen in the afternoon (around 3-4) and/or in the evening (around 8-9), too, but the morning toilet trips are always the worst. 
I know people sometimes 'feel' they haven't emptied their bowels properly after a toilet trip even though there is nothing in there - but for me there IS still stool in there as sometimes a few minutes later I'm passing another stool.
I sometimes have other IBS symptoms, such as a bloating in my belly, passing wind (which sometimes I have to suck up at the last minute as I think something else may pop out!) but the morning routine is BY FAR the most frustrating thing. 
I follow a heavily plant-based diet with hardly any meat or diary, so I don't need to add any fibre to my diet (I may need to decrease the fibre). When I first switched to beans/lentils and lots of veg, I noticed my stools were looser (as I sometimes became constipated), so was very happy and it all came out in one go. 
I have also tried some anti-spasmodic tablets, which seem to be a little hit-and-miss.
I've had various blood checks and swabs to rule out other things and have had a colonoscopy, too. 
Any advice or comments would be welcome.
Thanks, guys.

SO, I will try again:  Over the past month I have had discomfort in my lower belly, burping, and loose stools.  I don't feel like eating.  I get something similar once or twice a year, but I think I forget how uncomfortable it was.
I get colonoscopies every five years (had one last year) and they were all negative.  My mother, aunt, and daughter all have (had) IBS.  Does this run in families???  I know for sure anxiety does - we all have  (had) it, and I take the prize for this most intense case!  
Does this sound familiar with anyone?  I would love to talk with someone,so thanks!
Best wishes

"Hi
Im hoping that if i tell my story then maybe somebody can help
Im 35 years old. Up until about 2003 i had perfectly healthy guts and normal bowel movements but then i suddenly began to suffer from extreme constipation and stomach cramps. Basically i would go about a week without a bowel movement and then wake up one night at around 3am with horrendous diarrhoea.
Eventually i began using suppositories on a daily basis which allowed me to have a bowel movement more or less every day. This stopped the diarrhoea although i do still get it ocassionly . However i do still get cramps every day and i never feel i have fully emptied my bowels.
i have continued like this for the past 10 years dealing with pain on a daily basis but as i now have a child i feel that i need to figure out a way to make a significant improvement.
Any advice would be appreciated.

"Hi guys. I think I have IBS, I very rarely go toilet, I feel bloated, passing wind a lot, burping, back ache, headaches, I have had mucus before too. My question is, could ibs cause me EXTREME fatigue? My doc has diagnosed chronic fatigue syndrome. I’m 23 Male and a regular gym goer. Could my IBS flares be causing this? To the point where walking around for 20 minutes makes me want to fall asleep. I don’t really have stomach cramps but I have done a few times, I know that not every one gets the same symptoms. 
I’ve not been toilet for 3 days now, that’s 3 days of big meals still in my stomach, surely that could cause extreme fatigue and tiredness and malaise?

Since July 13th I have been in hospital, had 3 ops on my back and am now in a spinal unit. This being so I have lost all control of my bowels and bladder, but the good thing is I have only had a couple of accidents in all this time. The reason for this is because I am on a bowel regime. During the day I take 2 dulcolux, 2 senna tablets and the following morning i have 2 gglycerine suppositories and it works brill as it empties you for the day.

"Hi all the clever 'experts"" who sit on this forum. I have a really serious question to ask so I would please ask for some honest straight forward responses. My question is: I have depression that is worsening though continuing worse physical health. I went to see my doctor who insisted on putting me on an antidepressant but I am really scared because I was dumped on 1 years ago and left on it for years. I have a vicious cycle that I live in with both physical and mental health worsening bit by bit, to the point where I wanted to end my life on Monday to stop all the pain and illness. My question is what do you experts on here think of SSRI's? Have you used them? How did you get on? Did they control your IBS pain (these would be the only reason to consider using one)? Which one would you try if you had no choice? Lastly does anyone know if they stop/interfere with fertility? Please help , I know I need to take something as I sense I'm getting worse but I am so confused. My family's attitude was just to dump me on antidepressants and leave me there, I have past sexual issues that family should have responded to at the time, hence the original lot of antidepressants. There's a lot of pros and cons but I really need some decent advice. Any straight forward honest comments please, this is really messing with my head! Sorry to be so insistent about this, this decision has to be right. Also which one works quickest and takes least time to leave your system?

"I've suffered with bowel issues for almost 20 years, starting after a massive course of antibiotics for a serious cellulitis infection. Pain has never been a main feature of my IBS, more bloating, gurgling, wind and mushy bowel movements (sorry!). My GP recently repeated some blood tests, liver,kidney,FBC, thyroid,CRP etc, and all showed ok apart from a low Vitamin D level. But my GP couldn't really give me an helpful advice regarding the issue I went to him with, namely that my assumed IBS is really getting me down and making me incredibly depressed. He thinks my stress levels are to blame because I've had a lot of stressful events in the last couple of years, my partner of almost 10 years left me, I have to care for my elderly and unwell mother and more recently I have the threat of redundancy hanging over me. Any advice would be so appreciated as I'm getting to the point where I just don't want to eat because of the way my bowel movements are and as a consequence I've actually started losing weight which I can't afford to do as I'm only little. Please help if you can. Thank you for reading.

Hi
a cry for help please. I'm desperate for some advice as its really impacting on my life..
I'm 49 year old male, I've over last year/ 18months been suffering from some problems with my stomach. in last couple of months they appear to have resurfaced and got steadily worst. I had similar symptoms last year but they seemed to go away.  Symptoms as follows-
Very Tight and bloated feeling in stomach, (often after food) with subsequent sharp pains that come and go.hot flushes - again irregular - come and go and not always daily. Sometimes straight after food.
I wake up feeling relaxed and the bloating / tight feeling develops during day.
Some weight loss - I've recently checked and noticed I have lost weight.
Floating stools, colour medium to dark brown. I've never been a regular checker of my stools but on reflection they appear to often float. Sometimes I've noticed what could be mucus on them. Sometimes they are smooth/ sometimes  sausage shaped, cracked and lumpy- sometimes a mixture of both. Have not spotted any blood.
Stomach that 'rumbles' and growls a lot, both day and night
Health history- I've been healthy apart from a kidney stone 20 years ago.
I've been to Doctors recently and described the symptoms, I had been getting some pain in kidneys too and thought it maybe related to  a stone developing again but this appears to have subsided and I'm still getting issues with my stomach. He has put me in for a CT scan to look at my kidneys / diverticulitis but I'm thinking he may be looking at wrong area...
I am a person that suffers from a level of anxiety and realise this maybe compounding the problem but in all honestly it really now having an impact on me and I'm getting very concerned about it. I often jump to the worst conclusion and it isn't helping I know.
Any help/advice would be very much appreciated, thankyou all.

"In the past month in a half I have been trying to gain weight because I was skinny and I just wanted to put on a few pound while also building muscle. I started taking a mass gainer supplement/protein with creatine. And to my surprise in 1 month and a half I went from 117 pounds to 132. Which is crazy to me considering I had a hard time gaining anything in the past 5 or so years. Ever since I gained all this weight I feel bloated after eating. I also have been having anal discomfort and feeling like there a small rock stuck down there. Went to the doc for that and he did a rectal exam said everything felt normal but I could possibly have prostatitis because I also have a burning sensation when I urinate all the time(doesn’t hurt any more or less when I have a bowl movement and I have not noticed any blood). I also started noticing I was constipated so I started taking laxatives which didn’t do much, so instead I started taking probiotic supplements which actually helped.  Also my throat recently started hurting( feels like a  lump in my throat when I swallow)which I went to the doc for and he prescribed antibiotics for. But I don’t even think I have an infection because i don’t have any other symptoms.  I had abdominal pain which I went to the ER for and they did a ct scan and blood work and said everything looked normal and that I had moderate stool build up. Any one know if any of these symptoms sound like Ibs. Please let me know. Thanks.

"Hello all, I was diagnosed a few months ago and have been prescribed mebeverine, amitryptiline and paracetamol for pain. I have pain predominant IBS which means I do not suffer from some typical symptoms such as diarrhoea or constipation, but I have pain with little respite--perhaps a day and a half between flares. I can tell when one is coming on because I feel light-headed and extremely fatigued, and my mind doesn't work--I can't think of the right words and I make lots of mistakes. My muscles are very weak and ache. After that initial stage the pain sets in in the whole lower left-hand quarter of my body, and I am even more useless for several days until the flare ends. My worry is that although the medications do help somewhat with the pain (e.g. reducing the severity of it after eating), they don't really address the other problems such as mental fuzziness, weakness and extreme fatigue, and these are having a very severe effect on my ability to work well. No matter how much I rest or even if I go on holiday, it doesn't seem to prevent the next flare. For this reason, I don't know whether it would even help to take time off or (as my GP suggests) cut back on my hours. How do others cope with the impact on work and pace themselves so as to manage the condition?

"Hi all. I'm 26 years old and I've always had issues with my digestive system. I used to ALWAYS be constipated. Then I had a surgery for a bowel obstruction several years back. That greatly helped my regularity and I just assumed that was the underlying reason for my constipation.
Fast forward to now- I have the opposite issue-diarrhea. I've never felt such an intense urge to use the bathroom. And when I finally do, I'm there for at least 30 min. The best way I can describe the symptoms is literally just the most intense spasm/cramping that only seems to be cured by emptying my bowels completely. The cramping is so bad it makes me break out in a sweat/shaking. Then afterwards I'm left feeling faint and weak. Usually I'll lay down.
I don't have this all the time. But when I do, it will occur in bouts. Sometimes it will last 2 weeks or more. Then go away for several months and my digestive system seems to be fine.
This is the longest bout I've had and it's so exhausting. I'm on week 3 and having this issue at least 4 times a week.
Is this IBS or possibly something else?

I had a Colonoscopy just before Xmas last year as had terrible pain, frequent diahorrea and blood in stools.
It all came back clear and the biopsies also.
Had a couple of polyps removed during the procedure.
Well, I must say, the IBS symptoms I am experiencing have increased dramatically.
Severe diahorrea with nausea, spasms, cold sweet and agonising unrelenting pain, as bad as childbirth but with very little break in pain!
Sometimes it goes on for hours.
Other times I have agonising pain but with no bowel movement.
I’ve been back to my GP twice and I keep getting fobbed off, as my Colonoscopy was clear, and it was ‘ just IBS ‘...
  I’m starting to think, as my symptoms are worse since the colonoscopy procedure, that would it be possible that something may have been damaged or disturbed, during the process of using the wire and camera inside me?
Has anyone else thought this, or experienced worse symptoms since the procedure?

Now it's a constant pressure/pain that seems to get worse if I'm sitting/lying down and it has spread to my right side back a bit. Pain ranges from an inch below belly button to 2-3 inches above, an inch to the right. Standing offers some relief. Occasionally the pain is very sharp, but it usually just a constant mild pain. I get pretty bloated after eating now.
I have had some changes in bowel habits. Sort of alternating C/D when before I was constipated for years.

"Hi, just wondered if anyone has taken Turmeric (in tablet form) nd it cause an adverse effect on their bowels  or have any knowledge of the effect of it on IBS?
I was taking one tablet for 3,5 weeks then suddenly a few days ago woke up at 5.30 in the morning with diarrhoea and my stomach was unsettled for the remainder of the day. I didn't take a tablet that day but the following day woke up with D. again. After a couple of days it settled own. I had a normal BM yesterday and today but first thing in the morning my gut feels a bit unsettled.
I don't ""suffer"" with IB as such but will get the occasional flare-up, normally due to something causes irritation. Last time it happened was by adding too many nuts to my diet (causing daily half/half stools or normal and runny) and the time before that I had the same effect when drinking 2 x daily lemon water. 
This was proper liquid D, though. Does anyone thing the Turmeric could have been responsible? It's listed as a possible, though quite rare side effect.

"Is it common for IBS to cause frequent ruination during a flare up?
usually my body gets really hot and I have the urgency to have a bowel movement while simultaneously having the urgency to pee. I’ve had a flare up today and I’ve been peeing a lot, like almost every hour for the last 6 hours. I think think this is due to a urinary tract infection though because it doesn’t hurt to pee. It’s like my bladder is still full after peeing. Could this be a prostate problem instead? I’m not exactly sure but the frequent urination and lower abdominal discomfort is very bothersome. Anyone know how to treat frequent urination?

"I’m just wondering if this sounds like IBS to anyone? I get belly aches all the time and I have done for many years now. Whenever I have anything dairy my stomach starts to really hurt and I pass a lot of wind. 
I pass a lot of wind anyway, straight after I eat I have to go to the toilet! It is really annoying especially if I am out at a restaurant or something, I will get a belly ache because I’m holding it in. 
It’s not occasionally though, it’s every time I eat, not something small just a regularly lunch or dinner and I will need to just go to the toilet straight after it’s really weird. I’m tired all the time, I don’t really have much energy.

"Hi, I'm a 56 year old woman. After four months of bowel issues and tests, I've been told by the Dr that is more than likely ibs. I'm still a little unsure myself. What I wanted to know was is it normal to have quite alot of mucus on your stool everytime you open your bowels. Only everytime I go to the toilet no matter what I've eaten my stool is always the same colour and has a slime on it, plus for the past four months alot softer and have an oniony odour, even though I don't eat onion. My stomach also rumbles and churns alot through out the day and night. I am extremely anxious which I know won't help the situation. Sorry to be a bit graphic, but if anyone could help, I'd appreciate it.

"First of all I apologize if a similar post exists.
I've dealt with this issue of upper right side pain under my lower rib for 3 years now. My dr thought it was my gallbladder so sent me to a surgeon to speak with. I had an ultrasound that came back negative then a HIDA scan which showed my GB fraction rate of 65% which I was told is normal. Then finally a CT scan which was also normal. My CBC blood tests have all been normal as well. I'm thankful of course for negative test results but dumbfounded as to what this is. Also I really don't notice a difference in a bland diet vs a richer diet. I recently lost my health insurance so the scopes I was going to get will have to wait and have to wait until January unfortunately. The pain use to come and go over the 3 years and I'd have what I called flair ups. Well 4 weeks ago this pain came on in full force with pressure, fullness, acheiness that has been constant. It is driving me insane. It's worse when I sit upright and my bra seems to aggravate it too. I'm not sure if that's all in my head because I can't stop focusing on it. It's definitely causing anxiety. My question is does this sound like IBS? Does IBS cause this type of localized pain for anyone else?

"I'm a 21 year old male-
Since about July 17th I have been waking up every morning with diarrhea and a feeling to throw up. The diarrhea has been constant this entire time period. However the dry heaving is on and off. At the end of July I went to 3 different doctors to seek help but they all said it was a gastrointestinal virus and it would pass soon. I then went to Italy for 2 weeks but the entire time I was there I had severe diarrhea and dry heaving. The oddest part about all this is it only happened in the morning and once it became around noon, I'd feel fine the rest of the day. I ended up in the Florence hospital while I was there and got a EKG, Ultrasound, and blood tests. Everything came back normal. When I returned from Italy I felt sort of normal for the next 2 weeks. Until the last week of August. I have now been to a gastrointestinal specialist twice and he really hasn't helped. I've done a stool sample with him and nothing came up. Throughout this entire period I've had headaches, lightheadedness, fatigue and dizzyness. However, all of this could be from the dehydration of diarrhea and throwing up. In the morning once in a while, I have been taking dremamine, imodium, and this anti nausea powder I drink with water. At this point I'm begging for help cause I don't know if it's something I need urgent care for because it's almost unbareable dealing with this every morning as a college student. Any information in the right direction would be much appreciated!

"Hi I’ve suffered with Ibs for years usually it’s the awful cramps and diarrhoea and a flare up lasts about two days. Most days I take Imodium and probably have bowel movement once or twice a week. This time my flare up started on Tuesday it’s now Sunday but this time it began with constipation bloating trapped wind and very hard stools. This morning I’ve had a loose stool, but the last few days I’ve had muscle aches a headache that won’t shift and I’m hungry but nausea is there too. Is this all likely to be linked. These symptoms usually happen with the flare up but I’ve never had it last this long before. Doctors have also mentioned to me in the past that I may have fibromyalgia.

"Since May I have been having various bowel issues . First started as small pebble stool with white speckles . I went to my gastroenterologist in June . He was not concerned . He reassured me that it was not something that was cancer ( my constant fear ). I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy 4 1/2 years ago . Nothing found except hemorrhoids and gerd. ( no polyps ). At that time I was experiencing urgency and loose stools . He mentioned ibs at that time .
So my Gi dr. told me to increase my fiber intake this time around . I did not quite follow through . Anyway , symptoms have continued until this past week where my stomach has been gurgling non stop , been feeling less hungry and been having loose stools . I also for some time have been feeling that need to go to the bathroom even when I don’t have to. Feels like something is there . I know my hemorrhoids have been extremely irritated . 
There has been no blood in stool or toilet  just a little bright red dabs on tp which I know is due to my hemorrhoids . No doubt there . No weight loss or though I expect some this week as I have not been eating too much . 
I am scheduled for another colonoscopy this Friday as my dr back in June asked me what could make me feel better . 
So what does everyone think it is ? I know he was not concerned about cancer . I suffer greatly from anxiety , especially from health anxiety . 
Just so tired of feeling this way . Want to feel healthy and not be afraid that I have cancer . I know most colon cancers are slow growing so since my previous testing showed nothing , it is most likely nothing . Would love reassurance . Thanks .

"Hi everyone, 
I'm a 15 year old female with no health problems, relatively healthy eating and exercise usually, don't smoke or drink.
So a couple of months ago, I began to feel ill to the point where I had to sit down and later on that night I threw up around 3 times and had a little bit of diarrhoea. The next few days I still had this stomach ache and eventually went to the GP where I met with an advanced nurse practicioner, did a quick urine sample and was told I had a UTI then was sent home with some tablets (can't remember what they were called) which I had to take for 3 days. I took them for 3 days as stated and no signs of improvement. All while this was going on, I lessened what I was eating due to a loss of appetite so thats what I'm presuming was causing my constipation. Got booked another doctor's appointment, this time with an official GP (not knocking the nurse of course) and waited a good 17 days or so for my appointment. During the waiting time, I was having a whole range of symptoms which was pains just generally anywhere (put down to anxiety as I suffer extremely badly with health anxiety, which of course doesn't ever help!), stomach aches which were made better with food and just a fluxuation between constipation and looser stools, never properly diarrhea though. I found a small amount of blood, less than enough to cover a fingernail and it was bright red and obviously I panicked and told my dad who told me it was probably due to all the straining I was doing. I brushed this off as hemorrhoids and went to the doctor's appointment that finally arrived! So I told the doctor all the problems I'd been having and she put it down to an inflammation in my stomach due to my ongoing use of nurofen/ibuprofen for my terrible period pains and due to braces pain as well. She gave me omeprazole and said I could have a blood test as well so I agreed just to be on the safer side. Right now, I've just finished the four week course of omeprazole and I am feeling a lot better however my bowels are still all over the place. For example, one day I had a large orange ish coloured stool (which I read can be caused by antacids so I accepted this) and then another day it was slightly darker brown constipation. More recently, yesterday I was constipated and went twice in the day but however today (which has caused me significant worry) I had looser stools which were easy to pass so I'm not quite sure if they were normal or loose as they did keep their form but one ""part"" had a smear of blood on it! This has been the first time in ages so I will keep an eye on it because I have been straining a lot recently. I have been crying a lot because I am just so terrified as I've never been ""unwell"" for months and the blood has completely just knocked any resistance to the anxiety I was having. As well as this, I've been having quite a bit of wind, excessive stomach growling and I passed clear mucus from my bottom. Also, before having a bowel movement in the mornings I get a really nauseous feeling in my stomach that usually passes after I've gone. Despite previously feeling better after food, now usually if I eat something particularly ""fatty"" like I had takeaway pizza a few nights ago, I feel so ill and bloated.
Obviously, you never truly have something until you're diagnosed but honestly I'm terrified that I have bowel cancer. Now I know I'm young and I don't have a history of it (to my knowledge) but can anyone give me some peace of mind about what this sounds like? I've been trying to tell myself that I've probably gotten IBS due to the stomach inflammation and my stress triggering it. Furthermore, I think my nan might of had something wrong with her gut as I remember distinctly asking why she couldn't have something and she said she couldn't eat certain foods and she drank probiotics daily. I also remember my mum having troubles with bowel movements etc. Now obviously, that's not very useful as it could just be a food intolerance but any info helps I suppose. My mum passed away from heart complications in late April which has just inflated my anxiety about my heart and just my general health (like the symptoms I've been having)as she was only 46, 47 in May. Any help or advice would be appreciated (other than my dad being typical and saying just ignore it) and I wish you all well.
EDIT: the blood test was taken on the 30th July and it has been almost a month and I still haven't received the results. Me and my dad are going to the doctor's on Wednesday morning to ask about these results as it's been a while and I'll update this post after I've received the results. It was tests like CBC, liver function, kidney function etc

"In Jan of 17, got burning pain under both ribs. Dr diagnosed GERD. Two months later, same issue, plus, started noticing change in stool color. Went to gastro dr, in a panic. Did bloodwork, stool test, and abdominal ultrasound
. Everything came back good.
Fast forward 14 months. Out to dinner one night, burning pain back. For a week or so, able to have bowel movements, but not much coming out. Side note- I take a fiber supplement each day and eat fruits and veggies.
Now, i start obsessing over stool again. Talk to a friend who is a dr, who tells me to relax. I start taking pics of every bowel movement. Some are very normal in size, some flat or ribbon like, some short(2-4 inches long), some thin. Color all over the map. Brown, light brown, tannish. Some soft and mushy, some normal. Some even look colon shaped. Abdominal pain rarely present- a twinge in diff places here and there. Pain under ribs comes and goes. At no point is the pain overwhelming.
Back to dr. Tells me ""indigestion happens."" 2 months pass, where i am obsessing over all of this. More bloodwork done. Came back good. Since dr appt, I have lost 10 lbs. One dr tells me it's probably the stress I am putting myself through. Friend who is dr says same. This has also turned into a social anxiety issue, because I don't like staying out of my house for long periods of time. All I keep doing is believing I have cancer, either in colon, liver, or pancreas. Docs look at me like I am crazy. Now, ever since last gastro doc appt, I had 4 straight days of lower abdomen pain while defacating, with small super soft stools. This morning, short, thin, but well formed, and not super soft.
NOTE- I am 49 yrs old, amd have had stomach issues since I was a kid, but never diagnosed with anything. But at the end of my rope, driving all around me crazy, self included. Made psych appt as well.
And insight would be appreciated, and I will answer any questions as honestly as possible. Could this be IBS?

"Hello, its been a while since I was back here. I hope everyone else is doing better.
I got some tests back that nearly completely rule out anything other than IBS. I had the colonoscopy and it was clear. The only one i haven't got back yet is the small bowl xray and I think that will be ok. The hospital didn't chase me up on it so they mustn't be concerned. I Had many months afterward were my symptoms were managed well.
However yesterday I woke up with chills, a temperature and the worse bout of IBS (pain, foul diarrhea) I've ever had. What could this be? A stomach infection that's aggravating my IBS or something else? If so is there anything i could do? Is it a cause for concern or should I just wait it out?
Thank you
Bob

"I am writing because the word needs to get out.  Chronic appendicitis does exist!  Here is my story.  My son was a freshman at college and became ill in November 2017.  His stomach hurt, had lower right quadrant pain, vomited and had diarrhea.  His symptoms would lessen and worsen depending on the day and he began to come home every weekend.  He consistently had diarrhea and would also have flare ups where sometimes he would vomit (though not always) and his pain in his stomach lower right quadrant would worsen.  As we got into January of 2018, he also began to develop chest pains and other body / joint pains along with an elevated heart rate.  The pain would at times radiate to his sides and back.  Over a period of six months, I took him to the emergency room five times and every time they sent him home with no particular diagnosis.  He had every test under the sun including MRI’s, CT scans, ultrasound of the abdomen, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, video capsule endoscopy, gallbladder function test, SGI blood test for IBD, stool cultures, over 25 blood tests and the only diagnosis he ever received was IBS.  The only abnormal finding that came back from his MRI’s was minor swelling of his mesenteric lymph nodes which the doctors wrote off as a remnant of stomach virus.  Nicholas saw 12 doctors including four gastroenterologists, three rheumatologists, two general practitioners, two general surgeons, and an oncologist.  We ultimately settled on a gastroenterologist who diagnosed him with post infectious IBS and put him on low dose antidepressants to help with the pain.  I knew in my heart of hearts this was not IBS.  Nicholas would show up on my bedroom floor at 2:00 am in the morning in agony and I would rush him to the ER.  We kept him home for his second semester of college so that we could work on getting him better.  When we would go to the ER, I would always suspect that this was the visit that was going to produce an MRI proving he had an appendicitis but it never did.  By January 2018, I began to spend my days doing research and immersed myself in my son’s illness and how to get him better.  I learned a tremendous amount about a lot of various potential diseases and kept coming back to something that I read about in the blogs called chronic appendicitis.  I asked his gastroenterologists about the prospect of chronic appendicitis and they all basically said that there is “no such thing as a chronic appendicitis”.  They explained that if he did have an appendicitis then his white blood cell count would be high, he would have a fever and an appendicitis would show up on the MRI’s that he had gotten while in the ER.  They diagnosed him with IBS, the go to diagnosis when they can’t figure out what is wrong.  I began to reach out to general surgeons on my own.  In March 2018, we met with two surgeons, one who said that he would do surgery but was not optimistic and another who said he would do exploratory laparoscopic surgery and while in there take the appendix out.  This surgeon said that over his 20 year career there had been several situations when an MRI had come back negative and the patient had lower right quadrant pain and he went in and removed the appendix and that person felt better post surgery.  He was willing to do the surgery and said that while he could not guarantee Nicholas would feel better, he said it was reasonable to do.  I took this news back to my son’s gastroenterologist and was met with a reaction of “a chronic appendicitis does not exist” and that he strongly cautioned against the surgery and that it was unnecessary and would fail – in so many words questioned the surgeon’s ethics and said that it would be irresponsible of me to move forward with this.  So, we were in a holding pattern with things not having gotten any better and by this time it was May and once again my son was in my bedroom on the floor in pain and I told him we were going to the ER.  I met up with the surgeon while in the ER and we agreed that it made sense to move forward with the surgery notwithstanding what gastro said.  Nicholas went into surgery that morning at 8:00 am and the surgeon came out about 30 minutes later with a picture of an appendix that was clearly inflamed to his naked eye and was confirmed by a pathology report two days later as an appendicitis!  When Nicholas woke up from surgery I could immediately tell he felt better just by looking at his face.  His symptoms were gone; no more stomach pain, no more right lower quadrant pain, no more diarrhea, no more vomiting, no more flare ups.  Long story short, he fully recovered from surgery in about three weeks and he is now back at college (August 2018) feeling 100% with no remaining symptoms.  Textbook (excuse me, this is not in the textbooks) case of a Chronic Appendicitis.
I don’t know why the gastro community is so against considering this as a diagnosis but they are and it is frustrating.  I sent Nicholas’ gastroenterologist an email with the great news and his only reply was “glad he’s feeling better”.  Without reading other peoples’ stories about their chronic appendicitis, Nicholas would still be in pain with diarrhea and heading to the ER every month.  I felt it was very important to give back and fortify these peoples’ stories with additional proof.  Now, I’m sure Nicholas’ story is the exception rather than the rule but here is my non-medical trained checklist of a possible chronic appendicitis (not all are necessary): right lower quadrant pain (his pain would come and go), stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting during flare ups, other body pain (chest pain, join pain), your symptoms don’t change based upon what you eat and you don’t have excess gas and bloating.  If you have these symptoms and your gastroenterologist tells you chronic appendicitis does not exist he is just flat wrong.  Challenge that and go see a general surgeon.  Best of luck to all of you searching for an answer and I hope this story helps at least one person.

I first started with IBS symptoms around January time (stomach cramps, loose stools etc) I had my bloods tested for intolerance, stool samples etc - all came back fine! In general, my symptoms flare up when I'm stressed/worrying about things & due to the fact that this year was the year of my A level exams, explains why my symptoms were frequent! When my exams stopped, so did my symptoms! But now that I'm going to Uni in a few weeks, I've had another flare up & I know it's because I'm worrying constantly about it all! Has anyone got any advice on how to deal with this kind of thing? (Must also be noted, that even though I would describe my symptoms as being IBS-D, I don't suffer with frequent diarrhea. I tend to have a loose stool once a day/every other day) But how can this be controlled if its deriving from being nervous???

To cut a long story short for 3 years I was back and forth from the GP they said I had ibs and kept giving me so many pills i knew in my head that something wasn’t a 100% right I booked a final doctors appointment after endless google searches and looking up symptoms I thought I’d found something everything started with my back every so often I would suffer in so much pain couldn’t walk sometimes.so I pushed hard at the doctors to be referred to see a specialist as I was loosing feeling in my lower back and it was now more painful than ever the dr told I wasting everyone’s time and if they referred me to a specialist I’d be wasting there time too I didn’t get angry I pulled out of my bag a massive book and showed the doctor all symptoms I was going through she responded this is all in your head I responded I know my body any something isn’t right and I’m not leaving until you referred me to a specialist at this point I thought I wouldn’t succeed but she said ok I will push you through to two specialists one to do with bowl and the other being Physiotherapy but I’m telling you now it’s ibs.
I attended Physiotherapy straight away they found a lump at the bottom of my spine and told me the out come of what they thought it might be but to really know they had to send me for an MRI scan.
Which I had and the result was a slipped disc at the bottom of my back I was then referred to hospital to see another specialist and give the option of spinal injections or surgery.they then prescribed me a pain killer called amitriptyline in the mean time I was on so many tablets at this point not just pain killers but laxitives to help me go to the toilet.
I was told that this was a pain killer and a antidepressant tablet at this point I thought if I could tackle one problem I’d try it.it took 2 weeks to kick in and my bowels starting working better I wasn’t going every day but it was a start over time it got better and the bloating stopped and the acid reflux I have since been moved to another tablet called noratriptline and bam all the problems have come back I’m now in the process of going back to the other tablet as that had a better result.
I wanted to say it’s hard when you know there’s something wrong with your bossy and everyone tells you it’s in your head but I really pushed hard to find I had something else going on as well that the doctors were not prepared to listen to me about.but the key I think is relaxing the mussels and mind that plays a massive part in ibs.
I hope this may help someone else but I know what works for one doesn’t always work for everyone.but amitriptyline gave me my life back and improved a lot more.
sorry for the long message.

"Hi I have posted here before about possibly having IBS or something else..My symptoms have been occasional trips to the restroom right after I wake up..Mucus most of the time with or without stool.. My stool always come in different shapes and sizes..I pass so much gas.Lots of low back pain and now I get pelvic pains especially before a bowel movement or when gas gets trapped..Sometimes it’s not so bad but today was pretty painful..It went away right after I went. I also get pain on my right side stomach 2 inches away from belly button..This has been going on for 2 years already..I don’t see any blood or haven’t lost any weight..After seeing different doctor’s,  blood work, ultrasound and xray which all came clear I’m scheduled now for a colonoscopy for the end of next month..Doctor said she thinks it’s mostly IBS but wants to rule out other possible causes.. I’m always in fear that it’s C.. I’m always worry looking at my bowels.. Now I’m getting leg pains but not sure if that can be all connected or it’s do to something else..Maybe stress??I don’t know what to expect during my colonoscopy I’m somewhat frightened..  I believe I suffer from health anxiety..Any little pain scares me..I had been on antidepressants over 2 years ago due to health issues..

"Hi again,
I joined 2 years ago and made a post at the time things got really bad.
To summarise, I've had odd tummy aches since I was 16 and 2 years ago when I was 22 things got extremely bad. Initially, I tested positive for h. Pylori and had antibiotics. I felt better for a week and then it all came back a vengeance. Back to the Dr's who said the h. Pylori must have not caused me any issues and that the antibiotics had tricked me into feeling better and that it seemed more like IBS.
I've seen the doctors a ridiculous amount of times for this issue now and I'm just at a loss.
In the past 2 years I've tried the normal ibs medicines (mebeverine, buscopan, alverine citrate, peppermint capsules), I've also tried aloe gel and capsules & silicol gel. Tried probitoics. Tried FODMAP, gluten and lactose free diet. In March I had a sigmoidoscopy & everything including the biopsies returned normal.
Most recent the doctors have just given me a limitless amount of Imodium and sent me on my way. So I'm relying on Imodium to get through work when I make it in. With the amount of Imodium I take, I struggle to go the loo throughout the week (mixed d & constipation) even though really needing to (or I go very little bits and feel awful) and so I take fibrogel or sometimes a similar product from the doctors that I can't remember the name of - then it all hits at once & I start the cycle again.
It makes life stress and work miserable to sit through (I enjoy my job, like everyone I work with & everyone is super supportive) but obviously nobody wants to go to work with constant tummy cramps, pains and D.
Nothing seems to cause it and nothing seems to help it.
Other symptoms I have are fast heart/palpitations often and very irritable/numb/tingly legs (all of these combined when I try sleep). Mentioning this to the Dr, I'm told it's normal of IBS.
It's almost as though they read IBS or hear me say IBS and aren't prepared to consider anything else.
Whilst I am grateful nothing life threatening has been identified, I just don't know what else to do. I don't feel right 80% of the time and I'm so fed up of having to let people down at work when I can't settle my tummy down.
Now I think it is worth mentioning that I'm a bit overweight and would be naive to not consider this to be an issue of any kind.
Sorry this has turned into a rant. I'm just so beyond knowing what else to try.
I've now been referred to a dietician, but aside from re-trying FODMAP and gluten/lactose free diets, I'm not sure what else they'll do for me.
So anyone tried anything I haven't? Or had joy losing weight to help ease symptoms? Any advice is greatly appreciated at this point.
Thanks for reading!

"Hi there.
I am a 17 year old boy, and I have been encountering some discomfort in my stomach/digestive system for around a year now. The thing is, I was losing a lot of weight and I had ended up losing around 60 lbs in less than a year, and now I am on the path to recovery and I am feeling the healthiest I have in the past few years. I have been getting regular exercise, watching what I eat to avoid trigger foods, but through all this time, one thing has stayed the same...
Every Saturday, I get up and go to work, and I am always faced with extreme pain in my abdominal area, and with that I have very frequent, loose and mushy bowel movements, which are oddly very painful. It only ever happens now on weekends, and it's like my symptoms are gone all week and then they swell during the weekend days. Why does this occur?
I do not drink alcohol, or consume any form of recreational drugs. I oly take my anti-anxiety medication (mirtazipine) which actually seems to help my stomach discomfort;, and my asthma inhaler.
Can anyone explain this? Thank you for reading this.

I took early retirement about a year ago but I have kept myself reasonably fit.
Really the only thing that has changed is I used to wake up at 5:45am now about 8am
What is happening is I’m woken about 6am with terrible stomach cramps. I get up go to the toilet go back to sleep.
About 45 minutes later the same repeat until I get up.
It is very demoralising and tiring.

"Hi everyone. I have recently been diagnosed with IBS ,but I feel like the doctor is just diagnosing me with something so Ill leave her alone. I have upper right and left quadrant pain (feels like tender ab muscles). I go back and fourth between diarrhea and constipation. When I do have diarrhea it floats or looks greasy as if I am having malabsorption issues. I am more convinced I have pancreatitis ,but within the past year i have had multiple sonograms (most recent being a few weeks ago), and one CT which showed that everything looked normal. I also have blood in my stool from time to time (I have had a colonoscopy which also showed everything looked normal). All my blood work which looks at pancreatic and liver enzymes are all clean as well. From my understanding IBS pain is more in the lower quadrant correct? Does IBS also cause malabsorption issues? Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? Im driving myself and my family crazy because ive been battling these issues for so long and am not satisfied with this diagnosis. I feel that I may need a second opinion.

"Hi there
So about 3 weeks ago I had a blood test, the very next day I got a phone call saying that I was low on folic acid but everything else was fine with the tests and was told to collect some folic acid prescription done and dusted I dropped the stool sample off a couple of days later as I forgot to on the day of the bloodtest the same day I picked up the prescription, I heard nothing since handing it in 3 weeks ago and Im coming to the end of my folic acid (was advised to take for a month)
How ever today I got a call asking to come in and discuss my test results this upcoming Monday, Im wondering is this a bad sign? Surely they would of got back to me sooner if something was wrong and not wait 3 weeks? Also would this be to do with my stool and blood tests (maybe go more indepth with what the results were because I never really was told other than it was all good) or one or the other 
Also to note im in the process of getting diagnosed does this mean anything?
Thanks

"Hey everyone!
I'm posting here just to hopefully get some thoughts from those that are probably going through the same thing as myself somewhat. It might turn into a bit of an essay but I'll do my very best to keep things as brief and easy to read as possible.
Just to start, I'm a 33 year old British bloke. 6'3 and at a healthy enough weight, 14 stone. For the last couple of years I've suddenly had digestive issues that really get me down, especially when I think back to just a few years ago when I could basically eat what I wanted, when I wanted, and didn't have any issues.
So my main symptoms are indigestion, belching (I have constant wind!), constant stomach grumbling, nausea most days and also constipation with occasional soft stool, usually as soon as I wake up in the morning. I also have some problems outside of that including what seems to be constant inflammation in my ribs and sternum area, joint pain and really dry skin and constant muscle twitching, the latter which has started over the last few weeks only. In regards to my stools, they are often pebble shaped and seem greasy/oily, but now and again I will pass loose stools that smell like nothing on earth. It's a foul smell but doesn't actually smell like a stool if that make sense.
Now, admittedly I have suffered with generalized anxiety for the last couple of years, and understand that may have something or even a lot to do with it. I have very little exercise as I have lived like a recluse for those couple of years because of anxiety, and I know I wont be doing myself any favors. But something in the back of my mind is telling me that I'm not causing my own symptoms and that they are caused by something currently that hasn't been diagnosed. 
I know that anxiety can make symptoms worse, as can a lack of exercise, but they surely can't be the actual reason for my problems? Does it sound like a typical case of IBS? Is Celiac Disease possible? I contemplated going on a gluten free diet on more than one occasion, but it's so damn expensive! Granted, I haven't lost weight which seems to be a common symptom which seems to be a common complain with anyone that is Celiac. Your thoughts and opinion would be very much appreciated, so I look forward to hearing from you.
Cheers! Ty

" Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the drug Linzess? I take it for constipation, I try not to take it every day because of the side effects, however as my symptoms worse and I feel I am most likely going to have to take it daily. The only reason why I don't like taking it is because, regardless of the doors whether it be the Lowest dose or the middle dose 145,   Once I start going to the bathroom I do not stop and have diarrhea for a good portion of the day. I also noticed that once my diarrhea is over  which usually takes hours, I often feel gassy and bloated, almost like the stool is still there.  If I eat or drink something to bloat gets even worse.   The diarrhea from the medicine is usually when I take it in the morning on an empty stomach.   I was wondering if anyone had any remedies to stop the diarrhea from the medicine. The medicine is definitely a miracle drug, it just has major side effects for me like the diarrhea bloating and gas I feel like if it didn't have that it would be my miracle drug.  I thought about taking Imodium or other anti-diarrhea medicine but I am afraid to take something like that if I suffer from chronic constipation  any help is much appreciated as I am running out of ideas.

"Just wondering does anyone else suffer with high fatigue due to ibs or other stomach related problems?
I have had IBS for awhile now and somehow always coped but lately I have been waking up absolutely exhausted and it's been getting worse daily. Its not a ""tired mood"" but I feel absolutely knackered, even walking downstairs is an effort as my body feels like a groggy lead weight. Its like i just have not slept at all, despite having a solid 7-9 hours.
I have just started a new job and seriously struggling as I can't perk up or wake up at all. My mood is however sinking now. I did have a bit of a breakdown yesterday over how tired I actually was. I only wanted to do a simple task in the house and couldn't manage.
All tests from GP point of view are fine except for a stool test which shown high inflammation. I am seeing a specialist next week and hope for some answers, but apparently this is a colitis indicator?
No idea how to get some energy back. I have an anxiety problem as well which never helps and take propranolol but I have been on this long term without any fatigue.
Can anyone relate?

"Hello all. First allow me to say this. At times in my life, I've had the Stomach Flu where I'd have diarrhea, nausea for a couple days and then it would go away. I've hard random days and nights where I may have a little indigestion and heartburn. These day were few and far in between, sometimes I'd take an Alka Seltzer and everything would be OK. Things are a big different this time. Around last Thursday, I had a ""bubbly stomach"" and headache driving to work. It was fine once I got to work, but when I returned home, I had th same symptoms again. A bubbly stomach with a slight headache. No real nausea or anything. I assumed that I must've just had some mild stomach blu or bug. Well, a week has passed and I'm having the same symptoms (bubbly stomach, diarrhea, slight headache, and at different times, heartburn). It doesnt feel as bad as when I have the stomach flu, but it's been a constant nag of these symptoms (frequent urination too, and I drink a lot of fluids). Does this sound similar to anything you guys might have been through. I have no idea if I should tech meds and wait it out or does it sound like I need to professional medical attention? Tonight is even the first time I bought anything to take for it, because the heartburn was really bad. I took 2 Alka Seltzers and the heartburn is gone, but my stomach still feels hot and I have diarrhea still

"Hello! I'm literally at my wits end with all of this and need some others opinions. It's a bit lengthy so bare with me. Everything will be as raw and honest as possible so keep that in mind if it'll gross you out at all.
In the beginning of June I got food poisoning and haven't been right since. I got it after our fridge broke and I ate chicken that had gone off (precooked chicken that got too hot), I vomited orangey coloured sick twice (one straight after the other) and that was that. It was awful as naturally I'm not a sickly person and the last time I was before this was years and years ago (at least 6, likely more) but that was that, it took me about a week to start eating to my regular diet but I was back and fine, then a week after I had orange juice and just plummeted again. I felt sick every day (but wasn't), my stomach wouldn't stop hurting and groaning and all I had was gas and more gas. My bowel movements were still somewhat normal but when I was anxious they were worse. I had times where I felt incredibly ill and times where I felt semi-okay. They did a stool test and that came back clean.
So, same thing, I recovered from that and was somewhat okay - not great, I stuck to the food I knew was okay and ate a lot of that (sandwiches, certain crisps/chips, etc, nothing out of the normal for my regular diet).
Then a few days ago I had battered sausage and chips and curry sauce from the chip shop and oh.. it was awful. I felt fine at the time, maybe a little bloated but not too bad. However I woke up at 3 am in so much pain and the next day I was on and off the toliet all day, doing small bowel movements that ranged from being normal to runny but there was so many. I went to my doctors and she gave me imodium and that was that, I didn't eat for the rest of that day because I was too paranoid. So the next day I ate nothing but plain rice about twice, but still woke up the following morning around 3 am with awful stomach pains. The next day I upgraded jacket potato and nice biscuits and woke up at 5 am with somewhat bad pains and then that brings us to today where I've had wholemeal toast with a butter oil spread, hula hoops (crisps).
I keep getting a burning sensation in my stomach for no reason too, I kept dismissing it for hunger but after looking into it, it seems stomach ulcers can cause it too, after suggesting this to my doctor he just got annoyed and said there's no way I can have one as none of my symptoms match (which is false from what I've seen about them) and that I just have IBS. I was also told my IBS would pass but it's been three months since I got the food poisoning and I can still hardly eat. After eating anything, no matter what, I generally get heartburn or indigestion. I don't know why I'm waking up at these weird times, I generally don't even need to go to the toliet after I wake up. I don't really get much bloating (which is strange considering it's the most common IBS symptom).
Through all this I've not really improved, since the food poisoning I've just felt nausea almost every day, had stomach or back aches, stomach pains/burning and just generally felt awful.
I've had blood tests ran and found out I'm lacking quite bad in vitamin D and they're retesting me for some more blood tests (not sure what off the top of my head, feel free to ask if you're curious and I'll find out).
Another little piece of info, I think I've always had a lowscale form of IBS as I've always had cramps after sex and small reactions to food that last for a few of my bowel movements, not the entire day like last time. Any questions please ask, I'm honestly at my wits end and unsure how much more I can take with this all.

"Hi all,
Whilst I’m new to this forum, I desperately need advise regarding IBS. I was diagnosed about 7/8 years ago. However, upon being diagnosed my flare ups were manageable until last week. Considering I haven’t had flare up in a long time when I started getting a horrible stabbing pain on what I thought might be right on my left ovary, I was blinded by what might be causing the pain but never considered it to be my IBS.
I called in sick at work last Monday, but to be later admitted in to hospital, various tests showing nothing, I was later told that I have been getting spasms in my colon but not being told if it was IBS. During this period my manager said that I had triggered high absence and wants to do an absence meeting upon her return from holiday. Can I be dismissed?
I was given buscopan which worked wonders but now isn’t seeming to work on me? My pain has returned which is seriously the worst pain I’ve ever felt, it literally cripples me and shoots  through to my hip to which I find so hard to move. I have no idea how I’d get myself to work tomorrow and just feel so lost.
Your advise would be grately appreciated.

"Hello friends...I have been an active member in this forum...I found out something interesting regarding antacids ( proton pump inhibitors)
So, for a week or so because i had late night dinner and then immediately had to go to sleep and also with bad sleeping habits I got acid reflux...So i decided to take antacids for a week or so.....and started taking it in the morning with empty stomach..
Now, as i go to my study room and start studying i couldn't focus and felt tired with muscle aches....I didn't had any other issues, last antacids i took, when initially i got diagnosed with IBS and then stopped it....I had same feeling that time but thought that might be due to IBS and some vitamin deficiencies that time....But this time neither my vitamins levels were low nor i had IBS attack...So i thought why am I feeling like this...Then as i reviewed what did i do differently this week and  i realized i stated taking omeprazole...and i also realized for 1-1/2 days i forgot to take medicine and that half day i felt normal.....then i went to web and searched for the new researches done on this drug...And to my surprise  they have found out that many PPIs can cause muscle aches and feeling of tiredness...this is the post marketing survey of phase 4 trials....
Click here to view image
I am not telling this side effect can be experienced by everyone but as IBS and gastritis usually co-exist and many people with IBS are also on PPIs, i just want to convey that if you are feeling muscle aches, tiredness and lil bit sluggish in your brain function and if you are on PPIs then try to reconsider your options, there are other class of antacids like zantac and many more are available in the market.....

"Hi all, anyone taking multi strain probiotics?, are you having any benefits regarding bloating etc ?, I'm taking a multi strain probiotics supplement which seems to have a good effect on reducing bloating, I've just ordered a specific probiotic supplement it's a single strain one especially studied for IBS, this strain of bacteria is Bifidobacteria Infantis, apparently research says it can work well for IBS symptoms.

"I’m 16 and I’ve been suffering from what the doctors say is IBS since October 2017. I had 2 weeks in October/November where I felt really nauseous 24/7 and could barely get out of bed, I went to the doctor and they sent me to hospital because they thought it was my appendix as I had tenderness there and all the symptoms of it. I had a ultrasound and it came back clear and I went home. To my surprise all the symptoms suddenly stopped. In May this year it started up again, I got laryngitis while sitting my exams so I put all my symptoms down to that but it persisted and the throat symptoms stopped. I’m now still struggling in August so it’s been 4 months since the symptoms came about again but now I have a tender right side and have a cramping/sharp pain there which I’ve had for about a week and a half it doesn’t seem to be getting worse but it also doesn’t seem to be getting better. The doctor said I have IBS but I’m really not convinced as the tablets I’ve tried do not work and I don’t experience very bad cramping unless it’s on the right side, I’m also constantly bloated and it doesn’t go down and I still feel ill no matter what I eat, it really doesn’t make a difference, I also get very dizzy and exhausted even though I’m a good sleeper normally. I’ve also had constipation for about 3 weeks on and off with diarrhoea aswell occasionally and something unusual has happened, I’m on the contraceptive pill for my heavy periods which I’ve settled into normally with no problems but for some reason my periods are lasting for 2 weeks at a time and as I speak I’ve been ‘on’ for 4 weeks, none of it has been red blood it’s all brown and black (TMI I know) but I’m pretty sure all of these symptoms and how they’re occurring do not correlate with IBS so I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions or knew what could possibly be causing all of this?? I’m not in agony with the pain but it’s completely put my life on hold as I’m terrified to leave the house because of it.

"Hello, I had been fine until about 18 months ago (I’m 52) apart from a brief spell in my late teens of alternating diarrhoea and constipation. Then more recently the pain became very distracting and highly localised in one place. But I had none of the other classic IBS symptoms, only the pain. I had many tests which ruled out everything else and was told it was possible to suffer from pain predominant IBS. I was put on antidepressants which did help my sleep, as do painkillers. But I am wondering whether this is a lifelong condition or whether it goes away (or goes into remission for phases longer than a couple of weeks)?

"To give you some background on myself I went to Thailand in 06/05/2018 to 18/05/2018.
I got few mosquitoes bites which lead to my arm swelling which I got some anti inflammatory tablets then few days later they gave me anti biotic which cured the problem but I started getting mucus in my stool during the last week of the holiday.
Soon as I got back to UK I did have weird tingling sensation in my arm and I felt bloated and gained around 8 lbs and really felt it on my stomach with small amount of pain in left side of my body, I visited the doctor and shown them picture of my stool with mucus and they palmed me off saying much off been food or something when I was in Thailand that's upset my stomach but I had unusual bowel movements and different eating patterns.
Few weeks later, I didn't feel hungry and couldn't tell when I needed to go to the toilet as the sensation was different feeling so, I went back to doctors who did stool test and blood samples. My ferritin levels came back as above average but my stool came back as normal but that was one of the few times my stool was normal when I gave it to them. Usually it has been lot of diarrhea. They scheduled another ferritin which same results it was above average. They then did a iron blood levels which came back as normal.
During the last 6-7 weeks I've completely changed my diet to limit gluten and cut out processed sugar and carbs and eating more fruit and veg and going organic when I can which has helped reduce the pain and there is no more bloating and I've lost over a stone (likely due to healthy diet) but I still got a discomfort feeling in my gut and mainly diarrhea and unusual stool.
Doctor are saying they think it's IBS but I think it potential parasite due to unusual things in my stool and just thought nice to have 2nd opinion. I've never had any other bowl movement problems before visit to Thailand.
I've included the photos of the stool here:
I'd much appreciate your views or opinion, thank you.

"Hi, I'm 17 years old and suffer from a condition called Hypermobility Syndrome which causes chronic muscle and joint pain as one of the main symptoms - I wanted to mention this because I've heard that having this can cause GI issues. I also suffer from Acid Reflux, nausea and Indigestion (unsure as to whether this is relevant in anyway.) I had an endoscopy for this but it came back normal.
?Around 3 years ago, I begun to notice I would get episodes of diarrhoea which meant  I needed to have time off school. In my last year of high school when I couldn't hold it and ended up having an accident outside the school gates. No one to this day knows about it but that's when I noticed things getting worse. During my first year of College Ive noticed more symptoms and they are at the point now where my life is really affected. I wont leave the house without diarrhoea relief, I don't see my friends, I'm always in bed feeling under the weather, I'm always having time off etc. 
?I will suffer from constipation for a week or so and feel okay other than cramps, until the end of the week when my back hurts and I'm nauseous. I will then suffer with diarrhoea for a week or so with cramps and nausea. I've also noticed my energy levels getting worse (although this is another symptom of hypermobility syndrome.) I do also have odd few days or weeks where other than cramps I don't feel to bad and I will also have days where I have the urge to go, but cant and literally the same day episodes of diarrhoea. I also upon doing research saw that 'problems peeing' can be another symptom of IBS. I have to go a lot, can't hold it for long and sometimes really need to pee but cant.
?I've been trying to figure out if anything triggers it but I have a very limited diet, I eat the same food day in, day out. 
I take diarrhoea relief quite often and Ive started 'Colpermin IBS relief' to see if that helps. I want to see my GP about this but I am too embarrassed to go; does anyone have any advice as to what I can do / what to say to my GP. 
?I take 30/300mg Cocodamol, 20mg Esomeprazole, 300mg Ranitidine, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen (I do try to avoid this), Allergy tablets, Contraceptive pill (Microgynon 30) and Prochlorperazine some days too. 
?I don't think these medications are contributing to my symptoms but I thought I would include them incase anybody knows anything about them. 
Thankyou.

"Hey everyone. I hope I get quick responses to this since I'm sooo soo tensed. 
so this thing started more than a month ago. I had a bad stomach flu. Went in emergency and the doctor treated it with instant drips and a week's medication. it was fine till then and soon after the medicines ended, I started having episodes of diarrhea again. I notices that this was happening whenever I was eating outside food or something spicy. This time I consulted a gastronentrologist and he gave me a medication for another week and uncountable blood and stool tests. i got all of those done and everything came out to be normal. On 16th july i again had diarrhea. This time I went to another gastroentrologist since the previous one's appointmenet wasnt available. i took all the reports and he told me that this according to him is IBS. As it started after a stomach flu and it triggers specifically when you're eating bad or taking dairy products. 
Now since then ive started to take care of my diet a lot. Im a big foodie and I havent even tasted anything junk since then. But I'm loosing weight despite my stools are now normal. I get stomach cramps whenever i take some kind of tension or stress and feel like i need to empty my bowel. But as soon as I relax myself, the symptom goes away. 
My major concern is that Im eating way too less like hardly one time in a day properly and that too extremely nonspicy and nonoily. So can I suppose that this is the reason why I'm loosing weight? 
Did anyone else too loose weight in IBS?

Im just soo worried that Im unable to eat anything properly.

"Hi all,
So I've been struggling with symptoms for a good 5-8 years now. I'd say I suffer from IBS D, but it's a bit more complicated. I get trapped wind on a daily basis and have the urgent need for the toilet 5-6 times a day (loose stools...But I wouldn't say it's D really). I take Imodium Plus Comfort sometimes before I'm going out, but it can leave me constipated the next day.
One thing I've found is that when I do have diarrhoea or an upset stomach (mostly in the mornings), I then find that I've cleared out my whole system so don't need to go again for a majority of the day. So I was thinking, would it make sense to take a laxative or perhaps coffee (I know that stimulates it, I don't drink coffee personally) in order to get the bowel moving in the morning so then I'm OK for the rest of the day?
Would love to know your thoughts and suggestions!
Thanks

"Since about 11 days ago I have been having occasional belly aches, alternating between diarrhea and normal poops. I do have OCD and obsess a lot. Around the time that my symptoms started a close friend got a colonoscopy, then another and then another. I went to a few gastroenterologists just prior to my symptoms to have a screening for colon cancer. I want a sigmoidoscopy because I don't want sedation. I was addicted to benzodiazepines at one time and I am afraid to take them. In this stupid country I live in they will not do a colonoscopy w/o sedation. And now they will not do any sigmoidoscopes for cancer screening unlike the UK. So I am in a bind. I don't drink and I don't smoke and there is no history in my family of colon cancer. Any thoughts as to what to do?

"Hello, I've been suffering for almost a year with stomach pain that has led to loose stools and diarrhea pretty frequently (several times a week).  I lost about 20 pounds over a couple months and I've had a colonoscopy, ultrasound, and bloodwork which all has been fine.  Within the past few months the painful diarrhea has calmed down and I've maintained weight but my stool just doesn't seem normal anymore.  
My stool is always loose/soft and floats.  It is semi-formed so not complete diarrhea but it is in several pieces and they never sink.  I would say its a type 6 because it's semi-formed and it seems like steatorrhea but the stool is not fatty or super pale looking (crayon size but little bigger).  Sometimes I will have a normal type stool that is not broken up but it usually floats as well and rarely does anything sink.
I've cut out milk from my diet and experimented with gluten free but didn't notice any changes. 
I'm wondering if this sounds like steatorrhea from a malabsortion issue and I should go back to the doctor for further testing or if this is typical of what people experience with IBS.  Sorry for all the details just not sure what to do at this point

"In January 2018 I experienced extreme constipation and went to ER. They did a CT scan said no cancer but moderate bowel throughout colon. Was told to get Mirilax by GI doctor and later do colonoscopy and upper endoscopy. Have a bad fear of being put to sleep plus some heart issues so postponed that for now. In the last month and half lost 20 pounds. Continued anxiety and stress from this. Drs jus did CT again yesterday in ER and said all is fine and may have an ulcer. Given Prilosec and told gluten free diet needed. Sometimes I can barely eat, afraid the docs are missing something and getting thinner in face and the butt I did have is no longer there. People who know me see me nd say wow you’ve lost a or of weight. I’m scared to go out I know most people are thinking cancer or aids. Does anyone know of best way to put back on weight and find a good gluten free diet? I was told the FOMAD diet but still hard to find food. Also by bowel movements are frequent. Not diarrhea but just about 30 minuets after a meal, long and light light brown. I try not to google because just about everything leads to cancer or some doom. I suffer from high anxiety now just about 75 percent of the day. Is there hope from this?

"Don't want to drag this on so in a nutshell folks I was diagnosed with IBS yesterday after years of bad stomachs mainly due to stress.
Pain all over stomach, lower back pain, sore tensed neck & shoulders, heartburn & acid, flatulence, diahorea, headaches, feeling of total dread etc etc etc.
Off on holiday tomorrow to Italy with family & grandkids which should be a happy occasion but all I feel is the fear that I won't make the holiday, letting everyone down, being taken ill whilst I'm there etc etc etc, get it weeks before everytime I go away either by boat, car or plane then when I get to my destination it clears up within a day but believe me it's absolute sheer terror the day before I go on holiday.
Always suffered with stress unfortunately for years now which is probably why I also have psoriasis & AF. Doctor gave me sore buscopan, I've had 3 up to now & whilst it is a miniscule improvement it's not brilliant up to now, im also on omeprazole for psoriasis & bisoprolol for AF.
I've found that when im busy or occupied it's not so bad but when im alone with time to think it can be really bad & quite frightening.
If anyone in the same predicament could offer advice it would be much appreciated, many thanks.
Andrew.

"I am wondering if anyone has had the same symptoms as me before, to put my mind at rest that my new symptoms are IBS related.
I have had IBS for 20 years, and have taken fibre supplements every day that seem to keep it largely under control. But earlier in the year I had a major flare up, taking my IBS off the scale.
I had a Colonoscopy, and all was clear, confirming it is a flare up. I have been trying a new FODMAP diet that has worked a treat, and really calmed things down (would highly recommend it). But I am having real problems down below. This include:
- A stabbing pain in my bum hole and or it being very itchy
- Blood spotting
- the urge to go to the toilet, and almost like I am 'ready to go' all the time!
- I am starting to get a bit uncomfortable when I wee as well.
I have been checked out and have been told I have not got Haemorroids or Anal Fissures, nothing untoward. I am being told this is all down to IBS, but I I am not bloating at the moment, and the upper part of me seems to be much calmer recently. It is all in the bottom!
Before I go back and ask to be checked more about this, I just wanted to ask the wider sufferers if anyone has experienced the same. I wouldn;t midn so much if my IBS was flaring, but it seems to be much calmer...or does it take a while for all other symptoms to calm down...waffling now!
Interested to hear...and would be comforting to know if anyone else has similar things in the past...is it IBS or am I being fobbed off.

"Hi! I’ve been diagnosed with IBS recently. I’m on a low fodmap diet but it only seems to be helping my stool- no diarrea or constipation. I still feel bloated with wind. I use colease when my tummy cramps and peppermint oil tablets. I’ve also tried iberogast. I get episodes of illness occasionally- nausea, vomiting, cramps, gas, diarrea, flushing etc. Like gastro but not gastro. It incapacitates me and I end up in bed for a day or more. I wake up nauseous most mornings so I’ve started taking protein whey shakes to fill my tummy and stop the nausea. Sometimes it feels like theres something pushing up in my esophagus but not burning. I burp a lot after meals. I have no idea what to do anymore. My tests all came back normal. The endoscopy was normal except for some candidiasis in my esophagus- the dr doesn’t think its Barretts syndrome. Tonight I’m trying apple cider vinegar! Please help!?

"I’ve had bowel issues for many years now, and about 3 years ago I was diagnosed with IBS-C. I haven’t been able to go properly since, I used to get really bad stomach pain randomly and I don’t get that now, I still get pain but it’s not a big issue like it was back then. For the past month or so I have been going in little bits but still feel blocked after going. I took laxido for a bit but stopped as 8 packets wouldn’t even work, laxatives aren’t working as well anymore I still feel “blocked” after and they’re making me feel ill. I have had a blood test for celiac and it was negative, my ferritin is 10, vitamin D is low and ESR is 20 (slightly raised, but they weren’t concerned since the previous blood test in 2015 was also like that) I always need to pee, I can go and need to go again straight after sometimes. But I do drink a good amount (around 3 litres) but I’m very active, walking, running and weights. I’m going back to the doctors but had to wait 3 weeks for the next appointment. I’m worried they’re going to say it’s in my head, that it’s IBS (as that’s what the last GP passed it off as) but I feel like things have changed but not got better. I think they has been an increase in passing bits but I can’t remember the last time I felt like I had a complete evacuation, and although I’m passing very small amounts they’re soft and thin. I’m always tired and feel breathless. 
I just want some advice on what to do until then, any suggestions or opinions that I should go? I don’t want to be accused of wasting time or be told I’m being  dramatic. 
Does this just sound like really bad IBS or does it suggest something else?
Also it seems most of my levels like Full blood count have all decreased slightly since 2015.
I had low ferritin in 2015 at 28 (wasn’t told this at the time) although I was already on iron tablets and stuff. 
Also my TSH was 1 and T4 was 14 which have decreased since 2015.
I know that they’re in range but could they be too much on the normal low side and that could be the issue?
I’m just fed up with it, the bloating which is almost always present, and constipation is really affecting me.

"Hello all,
After some advice.
I have dealt with IBS for a few years and know the pain well. I also have developed pretty bad anxiety as a result which never helps.
I am really worried about my stomach health now. I feel a right mess.
For about 3-4 months I was passing blood when I went the toilet. Being a guy a thought, leave it, I was under high stress, it will go. It didn't and progressively got worse. During this time my toliet habits completely changed. I was consistently getting painful cramps at night, really bloated, gassy and exhausted. I was waking up at 4am just to run the toliet and pass blood (no stool..). It was horrible. The fatigue horrendous, not due to poor sleep just shear fatigue.
I can't eat much, everything upsets me. Sometimes I can go the loo 3/4 times in an hour, especially the morning!
I have developed bad reflux which I have never had as well which I think is due to the bloating.
I went the doctors who asked for a few bloods and stool tests as I was getting a mix of symptoms. It's hard to distinguish stomach health from anxiety...
Basically at the moment I am:
Congested constantly (throat mucus) and have panic attacks because it chokes me.
My eyes are swollen, red and itchy.
I have cramps, pains, gass and bloating.
Irregular toilet habit and frequent urge to go.
I can't stand on the spot?! My body just feels like a lead weight pulling me down and I get very dizzy all the time.
Migraines and tiredness
Allergies and balance issues ruled out by ENT after two years continuous tests. And Apparently the congestion and eye problems are related to my stomach issues?!
My stool tests came back positive for inflammation (pretty high) and blood presence (which I expected).
I have been referred to a gastroenterologist now. Apparently my results indicate chrons or colitis.
What can I expect and can anyone relate / give some advice of how to get better?
Thank you

"I have wonderedfir a while if I had an intolerance or possibly IBS. We go to Florida each year and when I'm there I literally have diaoroah 4-5 times a day. I have always put it down to the fatty food. However been getting it more regular when in the UK. What prompted me to go to GP, is for the last 6 months a week before my period I get an awful spasming pain in my upper stomach. Really painful. My GP told me that the hormone rise before a period can affect your bowels and it's these that are going into spasm. She has giving me some antispasmodic pills. I don't seem to suffer with constipation it's the diaoroah that is the problem. Sometimes I can hardly make it to the loo.
I'm going to keep a food diary. Today I had Burger king for lunch and an hour later the runny tummy starts. My GP said IBS is not good related, however I thought it was?
I feel extremely tired all the time and wiped out.
Due to go to Florida in 3 weeks and dreading the tummy issues.
Any advice would be really great. Is it ok to take anti-dioarah pills while I'm there?
Thanks in advance.

"Hi everyone, I’m a 16 year old with IBS. I’m wondering if IBS can cause some pelvic pain or uncomfortableness? Sometimes feels like sharp pain in my pelvic region. Today, I was swimming and noticed my pelvic area was hurting a little (like near the underwear line or something like that) . Like right in the middle of my pelvic region. The pain was from slightly below my belly button and a couple inches down. It hurts more when I press on it. Well, not just the pelvic region, it’s bascially my whole abdomen, from upper to lower. It hurts more on the lower left side or the very lower middle. I kept having the urge to pass gas but no way will I do that in a place with so many people.  I started having sharp pains and then it went away a little while later. I was burping a few times too. I notice pain in my pelvic region a lot more than usual because I’m like afraid I have bladder cancer or something. I’ve been getting frequent urination, like something is pressuring my bladder. My urine seems normal? The color is yellow to clearish yellow.  I can’t smell any odor. Well I noticed that if I didn’t drink a lot of water, my urine would be a darker yellow and it has a stronger than usual smell. But usually, it doesn’t have smells nor dark color. I don’t think I have blood in urine by what if I do and it’s like..microscopic?!!?!? I keep making me think about the “positive” stuff, like what are the chances of me having cancer, but then anxiety comes back with a question like, what if you like 8 different types of cancer right now and you don’t know it?  This week has been horrible! I didn’t have pain, my IBS stuff was better, I did constantly feel like I need to pee or my “bladder” hurts just a few days ago. It all started Tuesday after reading some vaginal care and UTI stuff articles. I felt fine but after reading those articles, I couldn’t help but think about and google symptoms. And then boom, I started getting symptoms after symptoms and now I feel horrible. I don’t really wanna go to my doctor. I haven’t been to the frightening, terrifying, hospital in 3 and a half months! I was anxiety free for almost 3 months! Why come back now?! IBS is flaring up. I’ve been so bloated these past few days (especially before  and during swimming). I did have some Pepsi before and it was gassy...I also had chicken nuggets and fries yesterday and then felt terrible after. I’m also noticing a lot of pain, just like before. Upper abdomen, lower left, lower middle, lower right, around my belly button. Some pelvic pain. I’ve have had pelvic pain like this before but I never paid attention until now. Anxiety is getting worse each day. I’m off of CBT for 3-4 weeks because vacation but at this point, I’m probably just gonna google the whole time I’m there. I just have this bad, very bad urge to google symptoms and more symptoms. Knowing very well I’ll scare and stress myself out more and more..............help??

"Ive had IBS for more than ten years now,on and off, so I've been able to sort of manage my symptoms. But recently I've been having burning or warm sensation on my face and neck. Does anyone ever have this? It's annoying because I don't feel feverish and it cause sweating and I'm not hit to the touch. I feel like heat trapped in my body.
I'm also suffering from anxiety and depression, so I'm pretty confused.
Any feedback would be very much appreciated. Thank you!

"This story could be so much longer but I will try to summarize it. This past December 20th I ended up in the ER with bad pain that everyone said sounded like appendicitis. The ER couldn't see the appendix in the CT but saw inflammation in the ""area"" and sent me home with antibiotics and tramadol . The pain got much worse before it got better and I also developed a fever . I took 10 days of antibiotics with a few days between then 7 more days given by another doctor. The bad pain was gone but my fever wouldnt go away and it was getting up to 101.6 off and on throughout the day. I had never had a fever that did that before. It ranged from low grade to high randomly throughout the day and my eyes would burn. I got so tired and weak and finally, I got a surgeon to agree to do a diagnostic laparoscopy. He ended up finding some things. He found what caused the initial pain. It was basically like my colon had a bulge in it. From what I have read and heard it is like a single diverticilum that got inflamed ? But I don't have diverticulitis . The surgeon also found that I had a cyst on my right ovary and adhesians pulling my left ovary downward and connecting it to my abdominal wall. This was strange because I have never had any previous surgeries or infections. He also said that my uterus looked very enlarged. He went ahead and took my appendix out just to be safe. I healed from that but I still had the same symptoms. My fever wasn't getting any better and I was running a temp literally every day all day. I was so sluggish. Work completely drained me. I also had irregular and unusual looking stool the entire time and what felt like nerve stings down my right leg and in my right shoulder sometimes. So many different consistencies and colors. Finally an infectious disease doctor put me on some major IV antibiotics for 8 weeks. Finally the fever had come down. I still have the strange stool but I had a stool test done that showed nothing was wrong. I was very shocked at that! I also had a colonoscopy to rule out cancer and crohns disease. I even had an EEG and some nerve test done after a random TIA that happened in the midst of all this. Now I feel much better, but I still have weird gut feelings, weird stool (though not near as extreme) and ""hot head"" as I call it when I will feel like a fever just flares up randomly. None of the doctors know what was wrong. I had soooooo much blood tested. They tested for every kind of parasite, infection, and disease they could think of. I still have the leg stings and achy gut. Any ideas ? Any similar ezperiences? Oh ! And my gynecologist says my uterus size is normal, but the other doctors disagree ...lol

Now it feels the pretty much same but much worse I always feel the need to go but either nothing comes out or if it does its just a small amount. I have no pain at all just the urge to go which stops for 30 minutes or so after I have managed if that makes sense

"Hey everyone, I have been driving myself nuts since going to the GI doc the other day and having to schedule a colonoscopy. I know that there are many reasons for a colonoscopy being performed, but I just keep thinking the worse. Might I also add that I am 25 years old and my grandfather had colon cancer, but not until he was in his 60s. 
This is a summary of my story. Last October, I was having problems with my bowel habits (started going more frequently, wasn't fully emptying myself, gassy and some bloating). This was going on for a couple weeks. Went to GI and they gave me Xifaxin, which seemed to clear up my issues. I had a few episodes since then, lasting only 3-4 days, but then last month it was all of that and lasted for a couple weeks again. Seemed that it was just like the last time in October. It got better and now I am dealing with the same things. Went back to the GI and I am scheduled for a colonoscopy next month. I am so nervous and keep thinking the worse, so any help or information would be helpful. 
Currently, I go to the bathroom a few times in the morning (not diarrhea or constipation, just having frequent BMs that are usually normal amounts), and then go a few more times throughout the day. Sometimes I feel like I haven't completely emptied bowels, so I push and only a little comes out but I know I shouldn't be doing that. Then throughout the day I have some bloating and increased amount of gas. Not really cramping except if I can tell I am holding in the gas. 
Over this whole ordeal, I have not lost any weight. I actually have gained about 7-10 pounds since last October (intentionally). I have not had any blood in my stools (there have been some incidences of blood, but that has been due to continuously wiping and irritating my skin down there). No fatigue or weakness, and no vomiting. I know all of these symptoms would lead my thoughts to be more cancer, so I am thinking I have IBS or something else but I am a generally anxious person and constantly stress about my health and well-being. 
Now I have 5 weeks until my colonoscopy and I know I will be thinking the worst this whole time. 
Sorry this is long, but any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

I've never had any bowel problems in my life. I'm 26 and currently going through a time of quite bad stress/anxiety.
Out of nowhere 3 weeks ago I woke up with painful trapped gas. It took all day for it to pass along with some watery stool.
Every day since then I have woken up feeling like I've been inflated, my stomach will start gurgling for ~1 and I'll become bloated at random times of day. I will often but not always have soft stool but no mucous or blood.
I've seen my dr a few times. Stool test was normal, waiting on bloods. She says it sounds like a stress/IBS type reaction and that it should pass.
The thing is, I have the gas/bloating every single day even despite full dose of buscopan.

"One of my symptoms is constipation which I know can be a symptom of IBS. But I also have a muscle spasm in the genital area and bottom (kind of like a twitch you can get in your eye) as well as groin pain and bladder issues like feling like my bladder isn't emptied properly every time I go. I have muscle pain in the buttocks as well but most of the time only the left one is affected. I don't have a UTI and have been tested twice. Does this sound like IBS to anyone because I think there's a possibility I might have it but I'm not sure because I haven't been able to find much information about these other symptoms I've been experiencing.

"I don't know a lot about IBS as I don't have the problem.   A friend was suffering for years from something which was diagnosed by GP and specialist as IBS
On her own initiative she had a gut Biome study performed,   This was claimed to reveal deficiencies in the balance of microbes and ""things"" in her gut.   As a consequence they were able to define what she needed and then supply the right things to correct her balance.   She has been feeling better for the last few months than for the previous 20 years and eats almost everything.    She doesn't know if the original diagnosis was correct.   Perhaps this is common.
I dont know much more about this but I suggest you discuss this with your medical experts.
I searched this forum and I didn't find anything about being able to analyse the persons biome and then produce a tailored cure    -  sounds wonderful and it worked for at least one person.

I had a colonoscopy in May of this year
And all was clear inc my biopsies
My bloods for celiac and thyroid were clear too
However I still have symptoms and am very stressed and anxious 
I have hated my diet some what and lost lots of weight like a stone
I also had a go map test and most was clear apart from some high levels of certain bacteria inc Candida
My elastase was borderline
I have just had a retest if my stool by the nhs after sending them my results.
When I had my colonoscopy they found to hemroids and I have seen small spots of blood
The nhs hav allowed me to have another colonoscopy this coming week
But reassured me all my recent tests were clear.
I have discomfort in my stomach quite often and I am worried sick
Is this normal 
Am I alone here?
Please help guys 
What else can I do to get reassurance?

"I am 25 year old male who weighed about 190 lbs 6 weeks ago. Now i am sitting currently at 178. I have lost 7 lbs from keto and another 5 in the recent two weeks from the nausea that is apparently due to ibs.
My story starts about 3 months ago where i had a gnawing burning constant pain in my upper left abdomen. I didn't think much of it as i had acid issues before. The pain actually got better as i ate PPIs(Lansoprozole) but it got triggered again through eating spicy food. My doctors at the time maybe thought it was an ulcer so an endoscopy was scheduled for two weeks ago that came out clean. Eventually that burning gnawing pain subsided. But a week prior to the endoscopy i went on the keto diet for 8 days to lose weight as i thought i was getting fat. I abruptly exited the diet however due to keto rash, and introduced carbs straight away into my system. This is where my ibs symptoms began. The day after i first introduced carbs, i drank a fruit shake with milk in the morning for breakfast and it completely rattled me, giving me nausea and heavy gas. These symptoms eventually worsened and gave me tightness/pressure in my back and abdomen which i am currently suffering from. I suffer from loss of appetite, nausea(worse in the mornings) and the back and abdomen tightness/pressure.
I've been to the ER, all my blood tests and ultrasounds/xrays for the abdomen came clean. They didn't give me a ct scan because i had one 2.5 years ago that also came back clean. I recently had an mri without contrast done at an imaging center, all my abdomen seemed normal according to the report. I recently went to another GI, and am having stool tests done as well some thyroid tests. I also plan to get a SIBO(small intestine bacterial overgrowth) test shortly from another gi specialist, as mine currently did not offer it.
I feel like i have done every test in my power to rule out the bad things, maybe another colonoscopy could help idk. I feel like if my nausea was a problem of anxiety and stress it would have subsided, but it only feels like im getting worse. I feel drained after eating as well, just a feeling of weakness. I have lost drastic amounts of weights over a short time and am starting to doubt the tests i have done.
What should i do? Should i be worried about my weight loss and neverending nausea? Is this tightness in my left back and abdomen normal? I start burping immediately after i eat for a very long time. Starting to become very concerned even though i have convinced myself that i have done everything in my power to make myself feel better.

"I'm 17 yrs old and for the past month, I've been having changing bowel movements and I think I have IBS. It started when I went to this one fast food place and I got diarrhea from it for 3 days. Eventually, it stopped but then it seemed that when I ate deep fried foods, I would get diarrhea right after. I decided to quit eating fried foods for good right after this realization and it helped. But it would give me some constipation that would stop. My bowel movements were finally normalizing themselves but then I had a grilled chicken sandwich from another food place and that made my diarrhea come back. I was disappointed and almost distraught. Like what do I eat, what do I do? It has been stressing me out for the past month.

"Basically i have the symptoms of ibs which are attacks after eating certain foods that r stomach might be sensitive too. in addition to this i have trapped wind and it’s been getting worse and worse ever seen i developed GERD which is a reflux problem and is causes a lot of burping and heartburn sometimes. I am 99% sure i have it because i did three main things to start it that are known causes: i age late at night, it was a big meal and i ate it quite quickly. As long as i don’t eat the trigger foods for it my symptoms aren’t controlled.  
but one of the strange things about my symptoms is that i get nerve pain and Muscle spasms and sometimes this happens as i hear the sound of bubbling in my abdominal area it’s like the wind is affecting my nerves if that makes sense! When i lay down the wind tends to go out through the other way and i fart. 
I’m worried that it is something else but i have booked an appointment with the doctor and i am going to ask if i can get a colonoscopy to see if anything’s wrong but i don’t just want to put it down to IBS if it might be something serious and i’m a bit nervous.

"Hi, 
So I've suffered from IBS for about 3 years. I use imodium several times a week to help with it. Some days I'll just take a couple, sometimes I'll take 3, and  if I'm having a particularly bad day, or if I'm out for the whole day, or going to a meal, I'll take 4.
Sometimes 2 doesn't bind me up completely, but 3 or 4 usually seemed to do the job.
Occassionally recently though, I've found that when I take 3 in the morning, I sometimes still need to pass a stool at lunch time. Yesterday though, I had firm stools in the morning, but as I had a meeting at work, I took 2 at about 7.30am and then one more at 8am in the hope this would stop my stomach playing up. However, on my way to work I suddenly felt a bit sick. I think I then worried that I was ill (i have a bit of a phobia of being sick), and the anxiety I was feeling made my stomach play up after another hour or 2. I then at about 10.30am felt desperate to go to the loo but I hate going at work as it's embarrassing. I took an early lunch so that I could go home (i only live 10 mins drive from work) and go to the toilet. I didn't have diarrhoea, but my stool wasn't firm, and my stomach felt really unsettled. I had to go 2 or 3 tines within the next couple of hours. I then took one more imodium which bound me up for the rest of the day.
I still felt sick for a few hours, but it eventually eased off, so I don't think it was a bug. Might be worth mentioning that my period is due today, so I might have felt nauseous because of that?
Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone has had imodium fail on them like this before? Does it sound like I am building an immunity to it, or maybe it could just be a blip as I wasn't feeling well anyway?
I'm really worried now that imodium isn't going to work for me anymore, as I honestly don't know what I would do.  Imodium has really helped me in the last few years to try as best as I can to carry on and do things, but if it doesn't work I feel it's going to stop me doing things like going out.
I'd be really grateful for anyone's input or experiences with imodium.
Thanks 
Vicky

"I have ibs-d and for the last two months it has been so out of hand. I usually run into issues within 2 hours of getting out of bed! I don't eat breakfast so it must be triggered by moving around. Once or twice a week it hits. But weather it be D or a regular bowel movement, I need to get to a bathroom or can have an accident!!! This problem started 8 years ago (I am a 55 yr old femake). It has ruined my life. I live around IBS. No one understands how embarressing it is. I am on Colestipol. For some reason that worked a bit. I also take 1 probiotic a day (1MD complete probitic) and drink 1 Pronourish a day. My diet is pretty bland to begin with. I do not get much pain with IBS, just that if i need to go i need to get to the bathroom ASAP. Does anyone experience that same issue?

"Hello, I’m 26 year old male I’ve had ct scans with contrast done on my abdomen and showed no signs or abnormalities maybe 2 weeks ago blood work has been good. I have been told they think I have ibs but haven’t been properly diagnosed with a colonoscopy, I have a endoscopy consultation coming up. But not sure what I feel is like pressure or the need to relieve myself tha area is located left side right next to your belly button it’s a sharp or pressure pain like I have to go #2 usually when I eat I get it sometimes i don’t have to go and sometimes on a empty stomach I can feel it, not sure if this can be ibs pain or a flare up?? New to this so any help would be appreciated was told also I may have a stomach ulcer but I don’t feel much burning like I was a few weeks prior, bloated pressure in my stomach and besides that lower left stomach pain I feel nauseous usually most of the day. Any help would be greatly appreciated or similar symptoms? Thank you!

"Hi guys,
I'm a 22 year old female and I've had ibs for about 6 years. I've had MRI scans, blood tests etc and nothing sinister has shown. I have tried EVERYTHING and I'm having not much luck.. I went through a stage of it not being so bad and having an attack of sweating, cramps, nausea and diarrhea very occasionally and just everyday bloating (which I am now very used to) the last month or so I don't recall ever have a fully formed BM- they are always loose without fail and it's driving me crazy. I woke up this morning with the most agonising stomach pain, I felt sick and had diarrhea.. it passed after about 2 hours but it leaves me feeling weak and horrible.
I know that anxiety plays a huge part and that's something that I want to get rid of.. any big occasion and it's so bad- my graduation was spent on the toilet and crying in pain, trips to the cinema, my birthday, when I went on holiday I had diarrhea the whole journey there. It's ruining my life and making me nervous to do anything too far away from home- can I see a therapist on the NhS? To help deal with the anxiety? I'm basically just wondering if anyone has any ideas of things I can try- I rely on bucopan, peppermint tea and a hot water bottle when my attacks are bad. But I've tried- Colpermin, charcoal tablets, probiotics, Fodmap diet etc and I just want to feel normal ????

"I am an IBS sufferer and ever since I was put on Strong antibiotics by my dentist for an abcess my tummy seems to be upset all the time with having odd bouts of diarrhea . I have a bloated tummy and have put on weight around my tummy and at times I get a niggle towards left side BT ribs but, below the breastbone or boobs. It feels likes perhaps, it is a nerve niggle and feels at times like something digging in. It is nasty when I am sitting having a meal, whether it gets squashed up with fat when, in that position, I just don’t know. Does anyone else get this and what caused it as can feel myself getting anxious about it. Would like to hear if you can enlighten me, thank you!

"HI guys,
so I'm finally getting a CT colonography in 5 days, I'm terrified actually - mainly of taking the prep - barium sulfate to be exact.  It says that there have been fatalities whilst taking it and it's freaking me out, that and perforation!
Anyway I guess I""m worried that it's something else now - that my IBS isn't actually IBS but you know what I mean, I""m too scared to even say it.
I've had non stop IBS for 8 months now, with little normal poop in between, sometimes, I get all the bristol stool chart in one poop!
For me it's worse in the morning, I ALWAYS wake up with gas, pain - like period cramps (for the woman) and then an urgency that I need to go - it's normally a number 5 on the bristol stool chart, followed by a 6 then maybe back to a 1.
Anyone else relate?
I'm so tired of this - diet doesn't help, I've tried everything, now my motto is f$c% it, nothing works, so I just eat what I what, however not PASTA!
I should give up coffee and other than that I eat a pretty healthy diet, green smoothie every morning, toast or oats, salad for breakfast and fish and salad for dinner  - the occasional fatty food but I'm a good eater, always have been - stress and having an anxiety disorder are my two worst accomplices.
Anyway sorry this is really long, I'm just tired of having IBS, looking forward in a scared way to the CT - at least I'll know what it is or not and then can move forward without freaking out all the time, or freak out more but move forward.
x THanks for listening, love to hear your experience with CT and/or IBS

"Male 24 I have had right side stomach pains for 2/3 years. Been going to the doctors on and off and kept getting told I had ibs, anyways there finally give me a colonoscopy in October 2017 it came back clear, there didn’t take a biopsy as he felt like there was no need. Any how still getting the pain I had an ultersound and that came back clear. There then sent me for a ct scan which the doctors have said that my right colon looks inflamed. I’m a bit confused as the colonoscopy came back clear and i have had stool tests in the last year which showed no signs off inflammation, could there have got it wrong and if not would that mean I have colitus. I’m just a bit worried as I can’t get to see the doctor until next Thursday. When I got the letter back from the doctor for the ct scan it said call for an non urgent phone consultation. Thanks

Dry pasta does this too but not on such an extreme (durum wheat is a big no i think) I have trouble with lentils too. Trouble with pastry too. Cant do sweeteners with ""ol"" sorbitol etc.

"For many many years of my life I always have sore stomachs and nausea. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and emetophobia (fear of throwing up) and my stomach problems are always just blamed on anxiety. I have them all the time though and it's just exhausting and worrying. I always wake up feeling sick and just feel sick or get sore stomachs every single day, even when I'm not feeling anxious. I struggle to get to sleep at night usually until after 12pm due to feeling sick. The feelings range from bloating to nausea to aches or a full feeling. I still eat quite a lot but sometimes I don't feel like eating because I feel sick (but usually I still do)
I also have bleeding when I go to the bathroom, I went to my doctor about this and they gave me an ointment, it did work when I took it, like usually there was no blood but once I stopped taking it (I took it for like a week, you're not meant to take it for more than 4 weeks) it just started again. I always feel tired because I struggle to sleep, and I always struggle to concentrate at school. I'm always so stressed because I want to get things done but I'm too tired and exhausted. I also get body aches and pains in my arms and such.

"Today I started to develop a burning sensation in my lower abdomen which caused me to have the urge to frequently pee and have a bowel  movement. After I peed and had a bowel movement it burned really bad and still burns after I go. It’s like an intense internal burning sensation in my penis and rectum. I basically feel really hot on the inside but I have no fever. This has happened to me before, it usually goes away eventually but comes back weeks or months later. I have had constipation prior to this, could this be a bowel problem or a prostate issue such as an infection? It’s been about an hour and a half and my symptoms are still present, anyone have any suggestions? I could definitely use advice.

"Hi all!
I am new to this group,
it was around 7 months back when suddenly i got severe gas, burping and stomach pain, the stomach was tender to touch.
The pain continues till today, I get stomach pain mostly on top of belly button and left side and the entire area has point tenderness.
Stomach pain is irrespective of eating.
I have done all kinds of blood tests and upper GI endoscopy twice and ctscan.
Only thing that came up in endoscopy was Antral gastritis with hpylori negative.
But I wonder if gastritis can cause that much pain and tenderness.
My doctor says its a functional pain and can be IBS.
I feel so depressed and miserable to think about the pain staying forever.
Please reply if anybody experienced the same.
Thanks!

"Hi,
I was wondering if anyone has taken anti-anxiety medication to help with their IBS?
I suffer with anxiety, and I also suffer with fairly bad IBS. My stomach is pretty much on my mind all the time...then it plays up...which makes me more anxious...which makes my stomach worse...which then makes me more anxious. So just a vicious cycle.
My doctor did recommend a couple of years ago that he thought that I should go on anti-anxiety medication as he said that that would be tackling the route of the problem, but I said no. He said he thought it was strange that I was happy to take medication for IBS (imodium, buscopan etc) but not for my anxiety.
I think I'm just worried about taking something that is going to affect my brain chemicals etc. but I feel like I've got to the point now where my anxiety is getting worse, and I can't really deal with these stomach issues any more!
Just wondered if anyone else has turned to anti anxiety medication for their IBS and if it made a difference?
Thanks in advance.

"Hi All,
I am new to this discussion board and I am after some advice. I have always had unusual stomach symptoms from a young age and they seem to be occurring more often with time. I am 24 and I was diagnosed with endometriosis 2 years ago. My stomach symptoms are stomach cramps (can be everywhere and sometimes really sharp right at the top) heartburn, burping, really bad nausea, lots of flatulents and loose stools as well as random body pains (like a pin prick), dizziness, headaches and shortness of breath. I am also very fatigue and sleepy. I sometimes will have loose stools up to 8 times a day and when these symptoms have been really bad, I wake up at 2/3am from my sleep with horrible nausea (thinking I’m going to throw up) but it ends up being a runny bowel movement. After going several times a day, I get a small cut in my bottom that bleeds. These symptoms happen at random times triggered by antibiotics, coffee and lactose and suddenly they stop. I’ve tried a FODMAP diet and it made me loose weight and I had to stop it after 4 weeks. My blood tests and stool tests have come back clear twice now, although I am always low in iron, vitamins D and my liver enzymes are slightly off. Doctors think I have IBS. I finally saw a gastroenterologist last week and had more blood and stool samples done. I am due to see them again in 1 week for a follow up on my results - they told me I’d need an endoscopy and colonoscopy depending on the results. I’m a bit scared of the two procedures due to the risks. 
Since my appointment, I’ve had random days of feeling queasy and episodes of feeling dizzy in the middle of the night and waking up dizzy in the morning. I’m so exhausted with no energy and random things ache.
All I know is I am lost for words and I feel so down, I’m over feeling so sick. It is making me anxious. Anyone having the same issues? Can IBS really be making me so ill?

"3 months ago, I had heavy bleeding after each bowel movement. Had stool samples taken which were clear and an examination which showed no sign of piles, haemorrhoids or such. I had this for almost 3 weeks and was exhausted by having three or four bowel movements followed by the bleeding every day. This suddenly stopped but the bleeding has now come back followed with extremely sore lower back pain on the right, to the point I can't stand up properly. I've had two bowel movements today followed with blood and the back pain is not being relieved by heat compresses or ibuprofen. I'm not due to go for a colonoscopy until next month.
Anyone else suffer like this? Does it sound normal for IBS? It's not just a wipe of blood, there is quite a lot. And the back pain this time round is unbearable.

" Hi,
From the age of fourteen, I have suffered with chronic constipation which came on suddenly from what I can recall despite having a healthy diet, drinking lots of fluids and exercising most days of the week. My parents and I have literally tried everything under the sun only to be met with little to no result. I began to suffer from severe depression at the age of eleven after losing my auntie whom I was extremely close to and I then began to suffer from severe anxiety from the age of thirteen to the point where I had really bad panic attacks on a regular basis until the age sixteen when I was prescribed citalopram for a reasonably long time. I developed anorexia nervosa at some point during the ages of eleven or twelve which I believe lasted until the age of seventeen even though I had many relapses during that time.
My father started to subject my mother to horrific forms of abuse when I was between the ages of eighteen to twenty three and my stomach problems really started to take a turn for the worse during that time. I was that anxiety-ridden and stressed out on a daily basis to the point where I really couldn't leave the toilet since my stomach was what I would image hell would feel like. My stomach still gets like this even to this day whenever I am stressed or I am in a difficult situation.
Things finally came to ahead where I said: ""Enough was enough! This is not normal for me and I genuinely feel I am in need of medical attention right now.""  not so long ago where I was unable to pass gas for four days, experienced horrible abdominal cramps, felt nauseous, completely lost my appetite, had great difficultly even passing the smallest pieces of stool and my abdomen was extended to where I looked like a pear. I decided to wake up my mother, I then explained the situation to the best of my ability and she finally agreed to take me to hospital due to how persistent I was being as I genuinely felt as though my constipation progressed to the next stage. I was told to go home and increase my movicol which my home doctor prescribed to me two years ago (I was on three sachets daily and the doctor at the hospital wanted me to take six sachets in total on top of two senna each night.) after he examined me and did numerous tests only to find out my stomach was full of stool. The six movicol sachets and two senna each night did seem to work somewhat after three days or so. 
I was at my home doctors yesterday afternoon in regards to my visit to my local accident and emergency department and he didn't want me to take senokot. He prescribed me dulcoease tablets and advised me to take two each night on top of the three sachets of moviol throughout the day. All I've had is different types of laxatives and stool softeners thrown at me including the usual advice ever since I began to suffer with constipation and I've never had any procedure done etc to find out the exact cause of why I am always constipated. I have had a thought in the back of my mind for quite some time now that it might be irritable bowl syndrome since it not only gets worse when I get stressed but also when I consume certain types of drinks/food (This happens occasionally, not all of the time!) such as diary and pizza etc. It usually only happens when I am going through a hard time though.
What do you think? Does this sound like irritable bowl syndrome? If so, how would I go about getting diagnosed? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

So for the last 3 weeks, I have been having an issue. Practically every morning, I awaken to a twisting, cramping, sharp pain in my lower abdomen, well below the belly button. It feels like gas or the kind of pain that is immediately followed by passing a very loose stool. Indeed, on a number of occasions, I have gotten out of bed to use the bathroom in the morning. However my stools have been completely normal as far as I can tell.
I have certainly been feeling abnormally gassy and bloated. The pain seems to subside or lessen when I pass gas or have a BM, but usually returns soon after. It is not a constant pain, though it is consistently present several times a day, every day. But like today, for example, while playing basketball for two hours, I felt no discomfort at all.
In addition to having this painful feeling in the morning when I wake up around 6:30-7:00, I also notice that it seems to intensify when eating meals. And I mean the reaction is simultaneous. I will be eating and the pain will start all the way at the bottom of my abdomen. I have read that the act of eating can trigger your colon? It seems like that is what is happening.
Overall, my stools have been normal. Always a shade of brown, never red or black. They have been normal shape and consistency. Nevertheless, the pain remains. It is the oddest sensation in the sense that I would swear I was about to pass watery, loose stool based on the discomfort I am feeling. Nevertheless, the stool is normal.
I did see my GI a week ago for my acid reflux/hiatal hernia issue and mentioned this all to him and he did not seem concerned at all seeing as I ""was not loosing weight, having bloody stools, or intense pain."" He did give me IBGard and I have been taking that 3 times a day. Not sure it is helping at all though.
A month ago, I also had an abdominal ultrasound ordered by my GP because he suspected I had an inguinal hernia due to an injury from basketball/weightlifting. The results showed no hernia and revealed nothing out of the ordinary except a left renal cyst that they will check again in 6 months.
Lastly, concerning my history, I can honestly admit that there have been a rather large number of times in my life when stress/anxiety/nervousness has directly lead to abdominal discomfort and loose stools. Whether getting ready for a presentation, or seeing a doctor, or waiting for a CT scan result on a lump that turned out to be nothing, I always seemed to have such problems. This feels very much like those times, except it is lasting 3 weeks now and the stools have been normal.
I also am aware that certain foods upset me. Greasy pizza, scrambled eggs, french toast ... often lead to loose stools and abdominal discomfort. I have had none of those things over this 3 week period, however.
So three questions:
1.) Can a person have IBS without having constipation/loose stools?
2.) Can an IBS flare-up last weeks?

"For past couple of weeks, i have been drinking alot of water (3 litres in the morning and 3 litres in the evening) and i have also uped my fiber intake. I drink about 3 litres during one hour. My schedule is as follows;
a) When i wake up in the morning, i have a normal bowel movement.
b) Shortly after, i take 3 litres of water and a fruit. I then immediately have another bowel movement that is relatively normal and sometimes mushy.
c) Within a few minutes say 30 minutes, i have another one which is a bit mushy as well. 
d) I then have another one later in the evening but this is a normal round bowel movement.
I am not sure if this is something i should be worried about. I do not have any abdominal pain, nor blood and no other symptoms apart from going 4 times in a day. I had a colonoscopy in march and a stool test which all came back normal.

It's in the upper part of my abdomen. The pain feels...full and sharp. Like sharp tearing (I don't think anything is tearing because I would be in a lot more pain). I had 3 slices of pizza earlier and some coke and a lot of chicken wings. I had to go poo earlier but I had to hold it in cuz no way am I going into those public toilet house thing. Like the one where you have to do your business in a hole, no flushing nothing, you can see everyone's...waste. Well now, I'm constipated and it's causing me pain. Passing gas does help.

"I’m new to this forum, and have join In the hope of some reassurance and support.  I’m currently undiagnosed !! 
I’m 49 peri menopausal. Over the last 8 or 9 months we ve had enormous stress.  I’ve had stress related migraines and anxiety. But over the last 4 wks my bowels have changed.  
So for about two weeks I literally would have movements quite hard to pass then I d have a day of “toothpaste “ texture. ( much softer than my norm). Then about 2 weeks ago I had diarrhia when I woke up and since then my bowels are just not getting back to normal.  
The seem to go between toothpaste texture to formed lumps covered in mucus ( orange mucus and floating stools). No awful smell , and VERY easy to go. Definitely not constipated.  
Dr is saying give it another  couple of weeks with no advice at all.  The only pain I feel is immediately before I open bowels  and it generally feels like a period pain.  
Does this sound anything like IBS ?  
TIA xx

"So since February on and off I was getting loose stools. It usually happened about twice a week and I'd get the cramps every now and then. About May time after it got worse and was happening every other day, I decided to go to the doctor just to check it wasn't anything else. All my tests came back clear (they didn't so any scans however so I'm not sure if I should ask if they could be done just to be safe?)
They said it was most likely ibs after eliminating possible other causes but couldn't give me medication as I breastfeed. They suggested probiotics which helped initially but now do absolutely nothing.
I'm now living in a constant hell of having loose stools and the worst cramps which sometimes get so intense that I can't move and I have to stop trying to go to the loo. My stomach always feels bloated and I just always get so nauseous too. It's a living hell.
I take imodium but it's so damn expensive. I tried an alternative with a different active ingredient but it did absolutely nothing. I took imodium yesterday after all evening the night before with watery stools and in the morning and it settled. Now when it's worn off it's come back to watery stools again.
I'm honestly at my wits end. I have a 14 month old and I can't keep sitting on the toilet for half an hour at a time, multiple times a day. He gets so restless and I end up getting frustrated as I can't get up and have to deal with him whining at me.

"Thanks for taking the time to read my post first of all.
Basically my story is this:
Before starting university 3 years ago I can recall having completely normal and easy bowel movements. When uni started however things started to go downhill, I would spend longer on the toilet, I was able to push most the stools out with relative ease but could not for the life of me push the last bits out, feeling like I had no control of the stools at the last part of my rectum. This led to much frustration and discomfort, I would have to CHOOSE a time where there wasn't a stool halfway out so that I could clean and get out. I would feel gassy, uncomfortable and extremely conscious.
The obvious suspicion was diet; which changed a lot during uni, so I introduced more fiber, fluids and fruit/veg, experimenting for the next 2 years. Nothing worked, even laxatives proved to help only slightly. I have tried fiber supplements (psyllium husk) and eating pro-biotic yogurt, Even when I'm at home with the same diet I had before uni, the problem persists.
I am a generally fit and healthy young (22 year old) male and have a normal BMI.
Finally, 3 years on, I decided to visit a doctor. He performed a digital rectal exam and reported no signs of hemorrhoids or other abnormalities. He did however insert a plastic device in my rectum and asked me to push as hard as I could, when I did he said that it felt as if I wasn't pushing at all.
He prescribed laxatives and said he thought everything was normal :s
This has frustrated and upset me and I am in search for anyone with similar experiences or even possibly a solution?

"Hi Ive been dealing with constipation for years now. Ive been taking miralax for almost 3 years which worked good until now. Sometimes I would use it on and off and use others things in between like magnesium and lactulose. Lately my existing fissure and haemorrhoid has gotten worse because I had hard stool which scraped (my stool is usually hard if I don't take something). I should also mention I can and do use the bathroom 1 or 2 times per day on my own even without laxatives but is terribly hard over the years. So I have had to up my miralax dose but it stopped working as good so I combined it with docusate sodium (colace). Now I am finding that I have to keep upping the doses because my stool has gotten even harder. My diet is mostly veggies and soup. Can someone please help me to understand this. I am feeling sick having to take these things in high doses and it still is not as good anymore. What should I do? My butt is killing me.

"I've suffered from IBS now for at least 12 years - my symptoms have been daily diarrhea and intense cramping before every bowel movement. It had lately become debilitating as it would always affect me after lunch at work and I don't have the type of job where I can run to the loo. I'd had to start skipping lunch altogether because eating a meal would be the trigger for the pain to start. In the past I'd been prescribed buscopan which had done nothing for my symptoms.
I'm due to start a new job in August and couldn't bare the thought of this continuing to affect me. I spoke to my doctor who prescribed Mebeverine which apparently works differently to Buscopan. A week after starting the pills, I'd had minimal relief and was considering sacking them off and then all of a sudden I realised I'd gotten through a day at work without the usual pain. I thought at first it was a fluke but more and more days passed without any pains. Granted, my stools were still looser than what I'd consider to be regular - but the diarrhea isn't really the issue, it has always been the pain that has impacted me most.
It's now 4 weeks since I started the course and three weeks since I had any bowel pain. There have been no side effects and the diarrhea seems to be calming down also (I was actually slightly constipated yesterday for the first time since my teenage years - most likely due to a lack of fluid consumed through the day as it has since resolved itself).
Anyway, this post isn't so much a 'help me' post but more a sharing of my experience. IBS crippled me for years and I didn't realise that there were other medications out there. Hopefully someone will read this and find the same relief!

"Hi everyone.
I’m new in this forum, I have a MRI on my small bowels tommorow. Anybody know how long will take for results?.
Also, I got referred for this due to having a faecal-calprotectin test. Gp suggested level should be under 50 and mine was 117, I believe that is still low when I have seen people on various groups who have levels in the 1000s!
So my question is. Could it be raised for any other reason other than Chrons/Colitis?
Thanks in advance

"I've been having flare ups once a month. What I experience seems to be different than what I've read on here. I have IBS with constipation. When I have an attack, I can't pinpoint any certain food that triggers it. I call it a trapped gas attack. It starts very low in my rectum and groin area. It is very sharp excruciating pain. It feels like I need to have a bowel movement or pass gas. I am usually unable to do either. Then the pain starts moving up to my abdomen and covers my entire abdomen area. it is so excruciating that I can't sit in any position to make it feel better. I can't stand, I can't sit, and I can't lay down. Though laying down is the best position for the pain. No matter what I have tried for the pain, nothing seems to work. I just had a flare up the night before last that is still happening now. I ended up in the ER last night to make sure it wasn't my appendix. It wasn't my appendix. I took Motrin 800, Tylenol, liquid Mylanta, hyoscyamine, and Xanax for the anxiety that the pain is causing. Not one thing took the pain away. I was able to have two bowel movements but they did not give me any relief. I wasn't able to even really get out of bed. The pain hurt so bad if I moved. I was just wondering if anybody else has the same symptoms that I am having. I don't feel cramping or diarrhea. I just feel Sharp Shooting gas pains like I'm being stabbed over and over. It's causing depression because nothing makes the pain go away. I'm very frustrated.

"Hi all, first time poster so please bear with me if this has been answered before or needs moving. 
For 6 months now I’ve been getting a pain in my upper left abdomen, almost under the rib but definitely abdo not chest. 
It started just after a kidney infection, it cane and went in two or so week fluctuations, it was irritating but not severe. The only was I can describe it is sore? Like it’s not a cramp or an ache, it’s a soreness.
Over the course of the next 4 months it gradually got more often and more intense and I noticed no specific foods that set it off, except maybe that straight after a fatty meal it can be worse and maybe fizzy drinks. The only clear pattern is that it’s worst early morning and I tend to wake up with it every day now, and it comes back when I am hungry - conclusion from me that it’s worse on an empty stomach. 
Drs tried to tell me IBS but have also had a blood test and ultrasound which came up clear. Tried me on mebeverine which did nothing and this week I’ve been given Buscopan and told to take it for at least 6 weeks before I go back!
I am really worried that this is not IBS & that the doctors are just being lazy, and so far the Buscopan is giving me headaches and hot flushes too... 
Does anyone have any insight as to what it could be? Does anyone else’s IBS only affect the upper abdo? 
All advice welcome!

"Normally my bowels would move every couple of days.   
On and off I get cramps and some mild abdominal pain. The pain isn’t unbearable, but it’s quite uncomfortable at times.  
I also have problems when on the toilet. Sometimes I would be sitting on the toilet and would break wind and this light brownish liquid would come out.  It’s not like diarrhoea, at least not like any diarrhoea I’ve ever had in the past.  Sometimes the fluid is completely clear.  The fluid only seems to come out when I break wind while sitting on the toilet - I purposely avoid breaking wind unless I’m sitting in the toilet for fear of having an accident.  
 I could be sitting on the toilet and would break wind and a piece of faeces would unexpectedly come out, as if it was trapped and me breaking wind had released it in some way.  This is embarrassing and uncomfortable.  
 I though it was taking too much fizzy drinks, so I cut them out and the pain and cramps persisted. I have tried swapping my diet around, eliminating things like dairy and the symptoms remain.  
these symptoms are much worse on the days I’m working!    I work three days a week usually by the second day of work my IBS starts to flare up.  If I’m not working I get some cramps, but never the mucous.  When I am working I would never be able to do a proper bowel movement.  It’s like working throws off my routine.  
I’m wondering if these symptoms are anxiety related, given that they are worse when I’m working ?  I suffer from anxiety, and have done for over 20 years, but my bowels have just got worse over the past 18 months. 
Does anyone else suffer from the symptom of breaking wind and then having mucous coming out?  That’s making me feel the worst,  I wish I could get it to stop.  
Any tips or home remedies on how to relax my bowels is appreciated.

"Hey Guys, I'm working on sharing my story, and would love your feedback and thoughts on my journey:
For as long as I can remember, my life has been ruled by my stomach. Riddled with a constant stream of major stomach and digestive problems beginning as a child, I’ve had issues keeping down my food, and finding foods that wouldn’t send me running to the toilet. By evening, I often couldn’t pull my pants up over my swollen belly, or even stand up straight. I would crawl to my bedroom and try to sleep the pain away. I took numerous trips to the doctor, all in vain. I was told I was everything from lactose-intolerant to suffering from IBS or IBD, maybe Crohn’s disease, or maybe just an emotional stomach. Every kid loves to hear that. All the pain you are experiencing is just in your head. Over the years, I tried so many different diets to no avail. I tried dairy-free for years, the FODMAPs diet strict to the guidelines, the AIP diet, as well as vegan in which I was so low energy, all I did was sleep and nap. Not the answer, especially during grad school.
I was beginning to accept that this was my life. Missing night's out with friends because I was too swollen and in pain to wear pants, throwing up at work to quietly and quickly brush my teeth before my next meeting, or an unexpected sneeze that soiled my pants. I had normalized these situations and accepted that this was my life. Eating, as routinely as possible, in small portions to stabilize my blood sugar while not upsetting my stomach was my daily chore. Trying endlessly to figure out what was wrong with me and why I was having such a hard time digesting food even with probiotic supplements and digestive enzymes. I eat well. I eat organic. Or so I thought…
So, when my husband mentioned to me that he wanted to try a new diet that was very different than anything I had tried, I jumped on board. Anything is worth a try, right? I was desperate for a true solution to my problems and not some mystery diagnosis or random medication. And I am so glad that I did!
Keto is so different from any other diet that I have tried. This is the only diet that actually fundamentally changes your metabolism and your body’s relationship to food and energy. After my quick ""Keto flu"" spell in my first week of transition, I have hardly been sick at all! As someone who was pretty much sick every day and swollen with cramping pains every night, this alone has changed my life. The last six months of my life have felt incredible. I can’t believe I spent years following traditional dietary advice of high grains, low fat, and low red meat. It just blows my mind to realize how much I have learned and what I have discovered about health and wellness through my personal experience.
On top of that, my energy levels are amazing. For the first time I can remember, I wake up in the mornings with energy. I have sustained energy throughout the day without the routine afternoon crash. I don't have to stick to a strict eating timeline throughout the day, and can miss several hours without eating and without getting hungry or the “hangries” which I used to be famous for. This may sound over exaggerated, but for the first time in my life, I feel in control of my body and liberated, not stifled, by my eating.
It is so easy to place the blame on something or someone else. It so easy to just accept that this is my fate, and I will always be sick, tired, and in pain. It isn’t my fault, it is just that my stomach is weak. It is so frustrating to try every diet under the sun, just to have nothing work and feel forced to give up. It is so disappointing to have doctors tell you there is nothing wrong and you just need to get over it. I’m sure there are many more people just like me, who have seen countless doctors, just to be given advice that doesn't alleviate the problem or makes it worse. The exact opposite of what we want to happen! Have you felt this way too?
I know we’ve all experienced some kind of health issue in our life, and it is so easy to blame anything and everyone for our failure. From the poor advice we receive to the food we eat and the habits we have made. Oh, I just don’t have time, I’m just so busy. The truth is, our health and happiness is totally in our own hands. And stomachs, so to speak.
There have definitely been roadblocks and slip-ups on my way to healing my gut. The fact is, our culture promotes the very foods and habits that make us so sick in the first place! Fast food, soda, low fat, breads, pastries, desserts, oh my! I can totally relate to how hard it is to look past the media and see the truth behind all the advertising and advice we have at our fingertips.
What I have learned from living the Keto lifestyle has literally changed everything for me. I have my life back; I have energy, I have confidence, I can focus on my life instead of my upset stomach. My career is going better. My husband has even told me that I am a new person, full of energy after a long work day and excited to interact with my husband and play with my puppies. My husband and I even did our first Half-Century bike ride on a tandem bicycle. I could never have done that before my Keto lifestyle. I now have control over my future, my health, my energy, and everything that’s important to me.
So, if you are truly ready to make a change, and you want to take control of your life and your health, it is never too late to change things. It will be hard work and you have to be committed. But anything is possible, with the right mindset. It is true that the Keto journey can be hard to implement and stick to, but armed with the right tools, it can change your life. It is never too late to take control of your health!

"Hi guys
Once I was diagnosed with IBS i was over whelmed by how suddenly my life was changing and how everyday seemed like a struggle. It seemed that IBS has a way of creeping and infecting every area of your life. Financial, love life,family life, work and social life. Dealing with the constant pain and adjusting to a new diet I have found  myself changing. I don't recognize who I am anymore..
I thought that because i changed my diet. I wanted results. I expected change and I wanted my life back. I have changed soo much of my everyday routine. The more my life has to adjust to an IBS life style change the more it felt like I was loosing a part of myself.
It is only through a loved one I have released that just following the new diet is not enough and that I spend most of the time feeling sorry for myself and missing my old IBS free self that in the end I'm not helping myself. 
I don't particularly like reading up on IBS and following peoples success stories because it always made me feel sad that this is now my life. I could not move past this feeling and again only through tough love from my partner do I now see that this is a very negative way to approach it.  
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE!!
Logically i understand the need for a more positive change where as emotionally I don't feel so confident.
How can I emotionally deal with my struggle?

"Hello recently I had a crazy fungal rash between my groin. I went to the doctor and they gave me clotrimazole and it went away from the sides of my groin. But during this period I was stressing so much then I got this weird tiny red dot on the side of my stomach. It burned like a cigarette, burned like crazy! Then eventually it peeled off and turned in to a scab. But ever since that I been getting a very warm/burning sensation on that side of stomach when I’m sitting down. Its on my lower right abdomen side of my stomach if I was looking down. Then I ended up getting another rash on my buttocks thats burning like crazy, two circular spots that burn.... I may have missed it with the initial rash of my groin and the patient first recommended I use clotrimazole for that as well. Photos are below. I just got health insurance again so I made a dermatology appointment and going to go to a gastro doctor or something but any hints or advice would be much appreciated. This stomach feeling started after I got that fungal rash on my groin which probably was caused by a yeast infection (I’m a male)

"just looking for a little advice - I have been getting acid like chest pains and gurgling for a week I have totally lost my appetite but I feel full and my stomach is bloated. I went to see my GP and prescribed me with antibiotics for acid reflux and diagnosed me with extreme anxiety. An hour later I got a call saying they want me to do a stool sample for a stomach ulcer I then went into major panic mode and went to emergency room with a heart rate of 130 from the anxiety. They took my blood and ruled out appendicitis and any other infection related pain and he believes I do not have an ulcer as the pain isn’t severe but to still do the stool sample. Before yesterday I didn’t have stomach pains but now I have stomach cramps and feeling bloated but an empty stomach pain, I also can’t stop urinating and feel constipated and I also feel tired and generally unwell. 
Could this be all IBS related due to all the stress and anxiety?

"I am a 57 year old female. I was diagnosed with gerd a year ago after having a endoscopy. For most of my life I have suffered from acid reflux off and on with upper quadrant pain, right and center . About 2 years ago I was on Augmentin for sinus and 3 months later doxycyline for a skin infection. 2 months after finishing the doxycyline I became very sick with body flu and also diarrhea and acid reflux with stomach pain. I got over the flu but not the diarrhea or acid reflux. I had an mri and they only found a liver cyst of no concern. My symptoms did not improve but gradually got worse. After 3 months I had an endoscopy that showed possible barrettes esophagus and they did biopsies, the results were gerd and I was put on Nexium. The Dr told me I would maybe be on it for life. I lost about 10 lbs during this time. Not good, I am 5 ft 6 "" and weighed about 103 lbs at this time. The nexium worked wonders, within 3 days I was back to eating and my stools had improved. I was however concerned about the drug and after 1 month I weaned myself off and changed my diet to the blood type for O+ added enzymes, probiotics and larch powder. I seemed to be doing better. I also went to see a naturopath and he put me on some supplement also. My blood panel he did looked pretty good. I carried on with life and was feeling pretty good. Gave up coffee , was eating right although still having my daily 2 glasses of wine. During this time and a few years prior to ,my daily bowel habits were about 4 per day all food motivated but normal. I felt pretty good though and would have occasional burgers , dessert of no consequence. About 2.5 months ago I started having gerd symptoms again and had introduced coffee back about 4 months ago. I made sure though I only had a 1/2 cup. I took my enzymes and probiotics every morning along with my Larch powder and was also taking prebiotic to build a healthy biome. Eating pretty healthy with occasional burgers etc. My reflux seemed to be acting up pretty regular and I came down with a sinus infection mid April 2018. I was getting ready to travel to Mexico City and went to my Dr for my sinus, she put me on Augmentin. 2 days in I developed morning diarrhea. I figured since it was morning and not all day I would get over it after I finished the course. I didnt, I went on my trip and it continued but was not severe. Day 5 of my trip I developed a situation of nothing but mucus and gas for about an hour which then turned into diarrhea. I had cramping pain but made it to my flight home ok. I figured I picked up a bug and it would pass. I have spent the last month believing I would be over this soon. Upped my probiotics and tried to eat carefully. 4 days ago I went to see my Dr after 2 days of explosive diarrhea she suggested based on my story it could of been started from the Augmentin and then maybe picked up a bug or parasite. She did not test my stool though. This was a guess. She put me on Metronidazole and 3 pills into treatment I had to stop. Had severe stomach pain ,nausea belching, acid refux, still diarrhea, feeling angry and disoriented. Terrible side effects including a white tongue. She then called in Cipro for me ,that I did not pick up for fear of the side effects that go along with that drug. I am in misery, still doing probiotics eating the brat diet, tea, water, still yellow ragged stool and yellow diarrhea, upper gastric pain, stomach pain, feeling like I am fading away, very tired and pale. At this point I am waiting for tomorrow when my Dr returns to discuss what is next. I considered putting myself on Nexium just to see if it doesn't help but am afraid because If I have something like cdiff , it could get worse ,and Nexium scares me. I am trying to eat as much potatoes and soup as I can to keep my body with nutrition although I don't even feel hungry. Not sure what to do? Could this be nothing more than Gerd/acid reflux that is causing my diarrhea or something else more sinister? Been to a lot of sites reading and am really baffled why the brat diet has not helped. Would love to hear any good ideas out there, similar stories and how to approach this and the outcome.

"Hi All
I've been diagnosed with IBS, yet earlier today I was in a lot of pain that has made me wonder if there is something else wrong. Just wondering if anyone out there can give me some view, thoughts or advice.
About an hour and a half after lunch I started to get some pain located around the top of my stomach area, just below my chest, which gradually got worse. It was a sharp pain that had me writhing in agony, it was painful enough to take my breath away, and it radiated pain through to my back and up to my chest. The pain would decrease and increase in intensity during the next 45 minutes to an hour when it decided to ease off gradually and eventually go away. During this time there was an increased need to burp, however I didn't feel bloated. This has happened to me before on a couple of occasions, but was then located in my lower abdominal area.
Just so you know in the last few years I've had numerous tests and investigations including endoscopy and colonoscopies, blood tests, ultrasounds, X-Rays, etc and nothing untoward has ever been discovered. The only things to note were polyps which were removed and benign, two positive faecal calprotectin results however last colonoscopy with biopsies a few months ago was fine and low vitamin D levels for which I take supplements now and again.
I'd be very grateful for any comments to know if this sounds like an IBS symptom, especially if there others that have experienced this type of pain.

"Wondering if  anybody out there has multiple bowel surgeries where you didn't end up with a bag. In theory sounds great however I have not had good use of my  bowels since   And over the past few years everything has just worsened to the point that during flare ups I break big blood pressure numbers and my heart struggles through the pain. The pain is specific to the area of operation.  I have tried all meds all alternatives.  Drs seem to avoid looking you in the eye and saying any truths. They just pump me full of ondansetron and hydromorph and  fluids and hope the flare up passes. And if it doesn't seems the only tool they have to get good money fom healthcare is a colonoscopy.  Then I find they don't really believe in ibs.  Especially if post op related.  Anybody any honesty would help. I also suffered through c diph during a post op wound infection and didn't eat for months after that. Thanks for any help.

"Hey guys... got a list of symptoms here for you all.  My doctors suspect possible IBS.  My symptoms are extreme gas.  I mean constant.  Burping and farting almost all the time.  The gas pain creeps into my chest making it feel had to breath sometimes.  Stomach pains all over.  They used to be one sided (LEFT) now the pain is all over my stomach at times.  I get occasional heart burn while burping.  My stools are all over the place.  Sometimes I have really bad diarrhea.  Sometimes it seems normal.  Often times I can see undigested food through out it.  Sometimes it mushy and floats and other times it is solid and sinks.  Sometimes I go days without a bowel movement and other times I go about 1 or 2 times a day.  Nothing seems consistent.  Sometimes I have blood on the tp.  Small amounts.  I have had a hemorrhoid in the past.  Sometimes it feels like a fart or stool is right at my poop hole and wont come out.  But mostly its the gas and bloating and pain.  The pain that goes into the chest scares me when it happens.  I recently had a endoscopy a few days ago.  They said they saw some redness and inflammation down near my stomach and where my intestines begin.  They biopsied it and Im waiting to find out the results.  They said they wanna do a colonoscopy next.  They tried me on the low fodmap diet and it didn't seem to help much.  Seems like no matter what I eat it messes me up.  To the point that Im afraid to eat half the time.  I have lost nearly 40 pounds in 2 months.  Unintentional.  Does this sound like IBS??  Oh and I have really bad dry mouth and white coated tongue also....

"Hi,
So for the past 6 months I've been having what would seem to be IBS flare ups. These flare ups generally coincide with when I'm on my period, or if I go through a period of eating unhealthy. I'm in my last year of college, and have my exams in a few weeks, so throughout most of this year, my stress levels have been through the roof! I've tried keeping a food diary, but generally something that can give me a flare up one week, can leave me feeling absolutely fine the next? My doctor wants me to take a stool sample to see whether or not my bowel is inflamed. If this test comes back positive, is it likely that my problems are due to some kind of intolerance/bacteria? And if it comes back negative, is it more likely that its just stress related? (Kinda hoping it's just stress related!) I'm 18 years old, and am already quite slim as it is, and I don't want to get into a habit of restricting my food if this is something that isn't going to help. What do you guys think?

"Hi, I've had IBS for about 10 years (Alternating between diarrhea and constipation). It has gotten a lot worse over the past year and a couple days ago, I developed this horrible stabbing pain that kept coming on every 5-10 minutes, lasting about 5-10 seconds each time.  When I push on my stomach to try to figure out where the pain is coming from, it hurts the most right below my belly button.  However, I am feeling the pain in the center of my stomach, above my belly button as well.  So I feel like it is radiating to different parts of my stomach.  It hurts even more when I stand and even walk, like a heavy feeling that I can feel with each step I take.  I have been having diarrhea with this pain, and I can't seem to eat anything without having to run to the bathroom.  However, when I push to go to the bathroom, I feel pain in my lower abdomen.  Has anyone ever experienced this before or have any idea what it could be?  I will say it started the first day of my period and has been going on for 3 days now, without any relief.  So I'm worried it might be endometriosis?  This has never happened before during any of my other periods, so this is new.  I'm not even sure if it is related. I have been trying to do a lot of research on the topic.  Any help would be appreciated, PLEASE!!

"I recently had a hemorrhoidectomy about 45 days back. Since then, I have been going through extreme pain and stress. Every other day, something new happen to give me trouble. I am not able to go for work due to this.
Initially, I was struggling to completely evacuate the stools. Gradually, I started feeling a continuous urge to pass stools. I had to go for passing stools 10-12 times a day.
My stool is pretty normal. Neither I am constipated nor I am having diarrhea. I don't experience any cramps or abdominal pain as well.
My GP has started giving me a medicine( Mebeverine + Probiotics) for IBS from last 10days. Now, my frequency to pass stools has been reduced to 4-5 times a day. But complete evacuation of stools is still not happening. Every time I finished passing stools with some left behind that doesn't come out inspite being there inside.
It makes me restless and uneasy throughout the day. I also started passing lot of wind which I never experienced before. However, my urge to constantly go for passing stools has come down.
Please help me to figure out, do I actually have an Irritable Bowel Syndrome or is it something else which is giving me trouble.

"Hi All
I was diagnosed with IBS, along with Fibromyalgia, CFS and Anxiety, following two colonoscopies, one with biopsies, endoscopy, chest and back X-Rays, abdominal ultrasound, head MRI, numerous blood, stool and urine tests, and after seeing a Gastroenterologist, Neurologist and Rheumatologist. The only things found during all these investigations were slightly raised platelets from my very first blood test, however the subsequent 11 to 12 blood tests have been fine, two positive faecal calprotectin results, three rectal polyps that were removed and were benign, haemorrhoids and low vitamin D levels.
My question is whether anyone knows if it is possible to have constant IBS symptoms?
I suffer with alternating IBS, however I mainly experience constipation with only having 2 bowel movements a week, although I can set my clock by their regularity, no blood and small traces of clear mucus now and again. I do get the odd bout of diarrhoea but they happen very rarely and I don't need multiple trips to the toilet. I almost always have bloating, burping,\ and stomach / bowel churning and gurgling, and just a constant feeling of being slightly groggy. At my worst the symptoms are accompanied by sharp, random abdominal pains, increased bloating to the point I look pregnant, hot gassy throat feeling, feeling unsteady like I'm on a boat, some shortness of breath and face feels flushed at times. My symptoms are alleviated if I can get active, unfortunately the CFS and Fibromyalgia don't allow me to do that often. Doctors have basically suggested I'm the picture of health, just wish I felt it.
Any thoughts, views or opinions on this would be greatly appreciated.

"I have suffered with IBS D for at least 20 years.
Last autumn we went on a cruise and I had very little trouble. This led me to ask myself what has changed. I though perhaps it was dairy but that made no difference then maybe fruit we had a large bowl each evening. Cut fruit right out and was better but not perfect.
Thought I'd look at the fodmap diet. Kept avoiding it as don't like cutting food out. Anyway I've discovered wheat onions and garlic are my enemy and found sourdough bread a tasty alternative. I can eat wheat in cakes and biscuits but not bread other than SD.
My stomach is so much better and diarrhea has stopped. I won't say completely cured as these things have a habit of returning but fingers crossed.
Have a look on line easy to follow and this video is very good

"Hello all, Here is my story.
I am a 29 year old male who has suffered from IBS type symptoms for the last 10 ish years. I've always suffered from C and D (sometimes in the same BM), gut pain, abdominal cramps, very burpy and gaseous, but the main aggravating symptom was pitritus ani (or itchy anus). Up to July last year this has been my biggest gripe. I've been to the doctors about this countless times and the only thing they have given me is hydrocortisone creams, steroids, and a stool softener. The creams will make the symptoms subside for a while but it always recurs. I've only recently found that steroids thin the skin so I won't ever be using them again. I've also had anal fussures (cuts) which have been caused by the constipation which I was given the stool softeners for.
I have consistently tried all the online suggestions - I wear cotton boxers, cotton gloves to bed, nails short, wash thoroughly after each BM (in fact I have a shower after and don't even wipe as it gets too sore), i only use aqueous cream to wash, fragrant free shower gel, fragrant free washing powder, no spicy foods, no wheat, gluten or dairy, I take piritun at night to stop skin reaction. I've wormed myself about 5 times in the last 3 months. I've even tried tying my hands up at night to stop me scratching. However, I think I must be a descendent of Houdini as I always seem to get out of my shackles and wake myself up scratching.
In 2010 I started in the gym as I wanted to put on some weight (I've always been quite skinny - think DJ Qualls off of the film Road Trip).
At the same time I also read about the benefits of an OTC drug called ""5 - HTP"", so I started taking a small dose every day. After 6 months my anal itch symptoms had gone and I was feeling the happiest I had in forever. My BM's were predictable in occurrence and consistency and I went up to a weight of 74kg (162lbs). Everything was rosy.
My life was changed when hit by a car whilst riding my bike to a football match. I sprained my wrist quite badly and had severe lacerations to my face and gums since my face went through the cars windscreen - this meant I had to eat through a straw for a couple of months and stopped exercising. After 4 months I was able to get back to the gym - but I had lost all my weight, back to 60kg and the worst thing the anal itch had come back. I immersed myself in the gym and work, to try to get back to the winning formula that had got me there. sadly this failed.
At this time I started having some other problems with sex organ sensitivity. I also read somewhere that 5-HTP could cause this so decided to stop taking it.
After a few months of failure I decided I needed a specialist to help me, and tried to get my incompetent GP to refer me explaining that all the treatments that she and the other doctors had tried before had failed. At this point she refused to refer me as I had evidence of anal fissures so she me prescribed lactulose to soften my stools to allow for healing. It made sense so I took this for a few months but it never seemed to stop the problem. The doctor also told me that I had IBS, gave me a little leaflet and said that I would need to manage the symptoms myself - possibly through diet control. (she refused to refer me to a dietician on the NHS).
So I went privately to a dietician - she was very helpful asked lots of questions, did a stool analysis test which found an overgrowth of candida albicans and another weird bacteria.
The dietician advised that I would need to follow an anti candida diet - first strengthening my gut with probiotics and then killing off the candida with tanalbit. I was poised to start this. Stupidly I decided to go to Global Gathering (a dance festival in England) to have one last alcohol fuelled weekend before accepting a life of mundanity. This turned out to be possibly the worst mistake of my life.
Whilst at the festival I started having intense constipation and horrific gut pains. Then the stool that I finally passed was tarry/dark black
not great when you're in a grimey festival toilet. Constipation, horrible gut pain and black stools persisted for a few days until i got back home. I then passed a stool that was black and very bloody. A huge pool of blood along with a lump of what looked like my intestine came out. I rushed to A&E who did some stool, blood and urine tests but found no problems. But would need an endoscopy and colonoscopy. In total I had 3 blood covered stools. Within 4 weeks I'd had an endoscopy (horrible experience) which found no problems and within another 4 a colonoscopy (even more horrible) which found no physical problems. Only that I had a very spasmy intestinal wall.
In these 8 weeks my guts became increasingly painful, constipated and bloated. I couldn't pass wind. I've tried to describe the pain many times - the closest would be a combination of twisty cramps, bloated, stabby, hot pain. Meaning that I had to leave my job and move back in with my mum. The mebeverine (anti spasmodic), movicol (to reduce constipation) and nortriptyline (anti depressant) that the gastroenterologist prescribed didn't noticeably help.
After the colonoscopy the gastroenterologist advised that I have IBS and referred me to a dietician - also mentioning that I would be put on a FODMAP diet.
Since I was in such excruciating pain I decided to research this and start following this diet.
The low FODMAP diet to reduce IBS symptoms is from researchers in Australia. They have coined the term FODMAPs to describe a collection of short-chain carbohydrates found in many common foods. FODMAPs stands for Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides, and Polyols - which increase gas and distension.
I had been waiting to see if the specialist was going to prescribe any steroids or anti biotics before I started the Candida diet - now that it didn't seem as though this would happen and since the FODMAP diet and anti-Candida diet are quite similar I decided to start both at the same time.
The FODMAP and Anti candida diet seemed to have an immediate affect - so much so that I could start to do some mild exercise again. I found that eating boiled low FODMAP vegetables reduced my symptoms noticeably. If I add meat it causes a lot of problems feels like my body struggles to break it down. Also the same for vegetables that are uncooked. I can almost feel the undigested foods travelling through my guts. It is very uncomfortable and I have to take a pain killer.
So after 2 weeks of consistent exercise - running 40 minutes every other day and going to the gym, doing yoga, eating soup, drinking lots of water, taking laxatives 3 times a day, along with mebeverine with Nortryptaline (and magnesium) at night - I feel like I can reduce the symptoms to a certain extent. It feels nothing like normal but at least I'm not in agony.
To make matters worse for the last 3 months I've had severe and persistent anal fissures which was probably caused by the constipation - I was prescribed Rectogesic 4 weeks ago. Applying this 2 times a day along with 2-3 sitz baths a day has thankfully and finally healed them up. Even the horrible headaches were worth it.
Since the fissures have healed up the anal itch has returned with gusto. Its a horrible niggle that drives me crazy in the day, but I can control the urge to scratch it. At night its a different story and I'm finding it impossible to stop myself scratching my anus to pieces.
So this brings me to today. It would be great if any one has any comments or if they've had any similar experiences. I feel like my life has ground to a halt and don't see a real future at the moment.
Has anyone had any similar symptoms? How have they managed them? Has anyone tried the Anti Candida diet?
Has anyone has a persistent anal itch and then found a cure?

"Hi everyone, I'm a 12 year old girl who recently got diagnosed with IBS. I also got diagnosed with hypochrondria and anxiety almost a year ago. I noticed that I've been have a minor issue with urinating. No, I don't see blood or feel any pain. My urine is still yellow or clear, depending on how much water I'm drinking. Nothing darker than occasional dark yellow from dehydration. Never had brown urine orange. Basically no weird colors. Just that I feel like after peeing, I still feel like I need to pee more? Or if I sit there long enough and try to pee more, a little more urine would come out but not a lot. Like its probably around the same amount of urine I usually produce. Just feel like my bladder is pressured or something. I've been EXTREMELY anxious and stressed these past few days. I also just took notice to this about 2 days ago. Like its not overly uncomfortable. I can still go on with my day and not feel like I still need to pee, usually just when right after I pee and still sitting down, it's like my bladder is pressured? Or when I'm constipated and have to push, more pee would come out even if I just peed a few minutes before. I've been so worried about abdominal aortic aneurysm these last few days and I'm convinced I have it and it's probably pressuring my bladder? I don't know, it's just my weird and annoying worries and thoughts again. It all started when I suddenly took notice to this pulse in my stomach thing that I had for a really long time whenever I lay down or apply pressure. I suddenly had an idea and made the stupid decision of googling...I'm a bit calmer since people have been telling me it's rare for people my age and since Ive never heard of this condition in my family or smoke, im all good until I'm older then I can worry. I also don't think I have high cholesterol or blood pressure since my doctor said everything looks fine the last time I went there which was in.. January? I don't know, just really stressed and freaking out over everything. I think another girl is also going through this AAA scare and she has IBS too! It a bit relieving to know your not alone...my friends can also feel a stomach pulse too?

"I am a male, age 58. I've had some worries with my stomach all my life. I had heartburn over a decade but currently it is not a problem. My stomach gets easily upset if I eat apples, beans or some other stuff. This is something that I've suffered from childhood. Last year I started to feel slight pain very low right side. I also felt very bloated almost all the time. Doctor took some lab tests and my stomach was ultra scanned. Everything was ok. No problems in the toilet. No diarrhea. Colonoscopy was not done. My prostata was also checked and was ok. The doctor adviced to start FODMAP and after about 2 weeks all the pain went away. That was in December last year. Everything was ok for over 2 months. Then the pain come back and now it is worse. It is not constant but if I bend forward I feel the pain and a feeling of fullness on the right side. The worst place is very down. There is also pain on my back. There are days that I'm almost ok but in the evenings the pain gets worse. I've tried to follow the FODMAP but is is very hard as I eat lunch in restaurants during working days and there is usually something suspicious on the plate.

"Hello, my GP diagnosed me with IBS after i finally got checked out. I've been having almost exactly monthly problems for the past 4 months (unrelated to my cycle which hasn't been regular for 10+ years). Starts out feeling like a regular stomach ache but ends up with almost like contraction type cramping behind my belly button, lasting around 6-8 hours, the 'contractions' bring with them nausea although it's not yet made me sick, chills and sensitive skin, dizzyness & confusion and extreme almost to the point of passing out pain.The pain turns to discomfort down to the right by my pelvis and next day it's like a very painful football stuck there. I was prescribed Buscopan to be taken when i feel an 'attack' coming on but this last time the pills did nothing. I had a urine test last week pass clear and blood tests at the same time which so far i havn't been called back for. I've been keeping a food diary which hasn't shown a certain trigger i havn't eaten before when i've been fine. My GP said she doesn't suspect my appendix so didn't feel the need for scans and prodded under my ribcage for gallstones but i really don't feel this is just simply IBS. Every time the pain is getting worse and i'm at my wits end with it with not being able to find a specific trigger in my food diary. Has anyone else felt like this? xXx

"Hi, I'm a 25 year old female. A few months ago I had seriously bad food poisoning. Vomiting and diarrhea. I went on antibiotics and probiotics and got better soon. However, afterwards I was left suffering from anal fissures and hemorrhoids. For about two to three weeks. I believe they eventually cleared up as the pain went away. During that period, and even at present, I have to strain to make a bowel movement. I thought in time it would pass but it hasn't. To this day, I have not been able to pass stool normally, it feels strained and my stool comes out in irregular shaped pieces. I mostly have a feeling of incomplete dedication. Then this morning I discovered mucus in my stool. What could be the cause?

"Idk why but my stool smells like rotten onions almost. Onion is the closest I can I think of. It doesn't really smell metallic. I do see streak of bright red blood on every piece on one side only and freaked out only to realize that my period is still here and it's only been day 4 (3-4 days are the main days, the rest is spotting for me). I was eating a salad with onions and beef. I'm a constipated currently. I hate the alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation because I can't tell if it's going to be constipation today or diarrhea and sometimes both in one day! So yea, I don't think I have blood in my stool (period blood on the outside, yes). Just the onion? smell. Is this just my ""IBS"" symptoms again or anxiety or even worse, cancer. Oml. I'm 16 and I keep getting cancer worries even though everyone tells me it's probably IBS and I'm absolutely fine. I think my constipation made me gain a pound or 2. Ugh, I'm just stressing out over anything and everything. Mostly health anxiety but also a whole bunch of not health related stuff. My therapy session is still one week again so basically one more week of constant anxiety. I swear, I'm gonna get gray hair soon, probably by the time I'm in my twenties.

"Hey yall. I'm new here. My name is Kylie and I'm a 14, almost 15 year old female. This is gonna be quite long so brace yourself. I've been getting really really bad anxiety for the past few months and I feel like the worse the anxiety gets, more symptoms show up. Its like anxiety and worries and stress had taken over 90% of my life. People think I'm the normal happy girl I was a few months ago but that's only because I'm pretty good at masking my feelings and always smile a bright...but fake smile. I started to open up more to my closest friends and then some more friends. They think I'm delusional, which I probably am. They think I'm completely and look absolutely normal, which I really am probably just normal and all fine. The anxiety first started out as being scared of claustrophobic places and always thinking about the worst case scenrios. It's always the what ifs. What if this, what if that. And then I started to develop health anxiety and have had convinced myself I have breast cancer, stomach cancer, heart disease, liver problems, kidney problems, ovarian cancer, brain tumor, and then colon cancer but many people think I have IBS. I heard IBS is common in younger people, females, and those with high anxiety? I also have a few people in my family who has IBS. I don't know anyone or even anyone in my family that has colon cancer, or even any genetic cancers at all, so I'm a bit relieved. 
I have all kinds of cognitive symptoms. Like lightheadedness, dizziness, headaches, not remembering much, fatigue, overlying stressed and worried, anxiety in general. And this is really weird but I feel like I think and worry so much about something, I actually start  to like..hallucinate or get delusional kinda and starts to feel like or ""see"" it even though it's probably not even real or there. I get frequent cold hands and feet. I think I've always had that but never really thought much about it until my anxiety started. I bite my nails because of the stress. My mom forced me to stop or she's going to ground me for a whole year! Biting my nails makes my nails more brittle and hurts and  bleed sometimes but sometimes my hand comes up to my mouth and my teeth starts to move sometimes without me even realizing. 
I also have some bowel issues. I get occasional indigestion. Frequent constipation and diarrhea! Occasional thinner stools than usual but upping my fiber intake helps a lot. My stool have been pretty thin for the past few days but probably because I've been stressing so much that I'm just eating and eating unhealthy food without caring and have not taken my daily fiber supplement or eats lots of fruits and veggies lately. I think I gained a pound! Or maybe I'm just constipated. I get abdominal pain-a lot actually. I wouldn't say anything close to severe to unbearable but it hurts frequently and not just one particular place but has happened everywhere throughout my abdominal. Usually the part above my belly button, upper abdomen I think, and the lower abdomen. The lower abdomen hurts the most frequently, especially the lower left, when I'm constipated. The mid abdomen had some pain too but not as much as upper and lower. The upper pain is usually indigestion, bloating, or constipation. It's a bit weird that I can sometimes feel my poop traveling down my colon because I'm so constipated (the pain slowly started to travel down, to the left). And then diarrhea is that super urgent thing. Had it RIGHT before my choir concert last month, probably because of the anxiety. I also have this yellow substance around my stool! And sometimes my poop smells bad, not overly and worth gagging bad, but a bit more smelly at times? I get so stressed sometimes, I either don't want to eat or I just want stuff my face forever with food. I have never ever seen blood in my poop. Had beets for a 2 days straight and my bathroom trip was not very fun and absolutely terrifying. My blood is generally medium brown in color. Rarely dark but more medium or light, I don't know. Basically, my stool appearances always change. The consistency, the color sometimes (never red or black or clayish or white), the size and shapes definitely, and has food particles in it a lot of the times. I often freak out over some tomato/tomato skin looking thing because it's looks like blood. I haven't had a lot of weight loss. There was a time I was really depressed and stressed that I didn't feel hungry and just wanted to lock myself in my room and cry and think about life, how unfair it can be. I didn't eat a lot that week and dropped about 7 pounds. My mom saw how depressed I was and planned really fun things for us to do and soon, I started to eat and have fun again and then I gained back like 3 or 4 pounds. I'm staying at thisome weight for months, hasn't gone down, but sometimes up but back down again. Read something about random fevers being a sign of cancer. I haven't had a fever since a veryyyyyy long time ago. No vomiting or vomiting blood. Sometimes I feel nausea when I worry to much.
Please help, is this just my brain and anxiety or does it really sound like cancer? I've been getting colon cancer scares but I learned there's something called IBS and apparently, everyone thinks I have it and severe anxiety. My doctor just waved me off, told me to calm down and the problems will slowly start to go away.  The problem is, I can't calm down. He recommended therapy but I never really like to sit and talk in person with someone, especially about my worries because I'm trying to push it away instead of remembering it and telling others.

"I have had IBS for 10 years and i was diagnosed with inflammation a few months ago. When i was diagnosed my doctor said i would have another blood test in 3 months to see if i still had it and gave me 10 mg Amitriptyline. The tablets are working and when i went back the doctor she didn't give me a blood test and just gave me more tablets and told me if the pain gets really bad i can take another tablet and to come back if it keeps me awake at night again. I feel like she can't be bothered and am just wondering if she should be investigating further. She had also done tests on a stool sample which came back all clear. I hope someone can tell me if i should be concerned and if there should be further tests or is my doctor doing the right thing.

"hi everyone. I haven't gotten diagnosed with IBS yet but my doctor said it's very highly likely that I have IBS but for right now, he recommended therapy because most of my symptoms or all of them is anxiety related. Also because my symptoms usually go away when I'm not stressed or my anxious for a period of time. Like once, i was stress free for a month and my symptoms started to go away or maybe I just don't notice because I was happy and no anxiety. And then it all came back..currently, I'm still freaking out over colon cancer. It's good that I don't have alarming symptoms like unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds or more, never seen blood in stool, and I've never heard of cancer in my family. If there is cancer, I don't think they're genetic. I'm also 14 so that's pretty young, I guess. But I'm freaking out that I've seen small and thin stools before, right now too actually. I noticed that this last week, my stool has been thinner. But I also haven't been really healthy this week and didn't take my fiber supplement my doctor said to take. Fiber does bulk up my stool I think. Is thin or skinny stools a symptom of IBS? I don't get thin stools all the time, the size and shapes are constantly changing. Even consistency. I've been really stressed out lately. Is thin, sometimes pencil thin, stools a symptom of IBS or is it CANCER?!

"Hi all,
I'm hoping somebody can help me, for a long time now i've been suffering from issues  with my bowel, mainly stool size and the occasional bit of discomfort, my stools vary but  change from small millimetre thick pencils (not even the thickness of a finger) to medium cow pat consistency stools neither of these feel solid but are regular each morning whatever the consistency, i can not remember the last time i had a normal shaped stool!,
i've tried psyllium husk on its own and with added probiotics which works to some degree but has recently worked less day by day and now not at all which is confusing to me since it's meant to bulk the stool, my diet is fairly consistent and contains wholemeal bread, meat, carrots etc, potatoes, fruit and i drink quite a fair amount of water during the day.
I'm hoping somebody can help me out, with any product suggestions or with what i'm doing wrong  :D

"Hello,
I'm a healthy 42 yo male who's lived with IBS for >10 years  But recently my situation changed.  My new symptoms started about a month ago with what I presumed was an intestinal infection (fever, diarrhea for a day).  Stool cultures were negative.  Since then I've had pretty much constant abdominal pains that are mild, occasional cramps and are located mostly left lower, lower and right lower.  Lots of churning and gurgling too.  My stools are frequent, mushy but have never been bloody and the diarrhea has very much improved.  My appetite is poor and I have trouble sleeping due to churning / gurgling and cramps.  Occasionally I've woken up in the middle of the night to have a BM.  Had a colonoscopy recently that showed a couple areas in my colon and terminal ileum of ""focal, mildly active inflammation and cyptitis"".  Pathologist said ""not characteristic of Crohn's but cannot rule it out"".  GI doc is not convinced it's Crohn's, thinks it's more likely a post infectious inflammation that will eventually calm down.  Plan is to wait a few months and see what happens.  Anyone else have a similar experience?  Did your symptoms get better with time or did you end up on treatment / diagnosed with Crohn's? 
Thanks for any insight!

"so about the liver/gallbladder disease stuff I posted so much about, I'm almost over that fear because everyone is telling me Im fine and I think it's slowly making its way in my head this time. But yesterday my anxiety fueled up again because I noticed how the past few months, my upper abdomen looks a but swelled, not always but sometimes it looks bigger. And of course abdomen swelling is a symptom of liver disease. But my mom reassured me it could be constipation and possible IBS symptoms I've been experiencing. It's not right under my rib cage, more like above my belly button. It's like a line almost, across that area about 1 inch about my belly button. I usually wake up and it's gone? Or have a large bowel movement which I haven't been able to do in this past week. It's would get big again after a large meal. I also feel some pain there. Well, more like fullness. This week, my anxiety is getting realllllllllllllly bad. But luckily, it less about health. I have a lot going on, like a choir concert that I have a solo on, presenting my art project at school because I think fell in the top 5, getting ready for a big field trip and vacation right after field trip (packing), finals/exams, my orchestra concert, AND my honor roll ceremony, all this week, Monday to Thursday. I'm really stressed out and very very very anxious. I got 2 headaches just today. Does anyone else get this head pressure feeling or lightheadedness after being really anxious? I also notice a lot of mucus in my stool (brown-yellow substance). My stool, today is a green brown? I haven't had a lot of greens yesterday or today but had a large salad with avocado spread on bread on Sunday. I am a bit constipated so maybe that's why it just turned green today? My neck also hurts, however my right shoulder pain thing kinda subsided. Help, is this just simply IBS and anxiety?

"I am a 12-year-old female. Recently, I developed the ""Googling Syndrome"". I don't think it's a thing but that's what my friends came up with because I google wayyy to much. I had went from one health anxiety to another. From breast cancer, to ovarian cancer, to colon cancer, to now, I'm convinced I have a liver or gallbladder problem. I don't think I have yellow skin or eyes. I did begin to ""see"" a yellow tint but I stopped worrying about the yellow and now, I don't really see the ""yellow"" anymore. I asked so many people if I look abnormal, like do I look yellow, do my eyes? They all say I look absolutely fine and no, I don't look yellow at all, it's just the anxiety causing it. My stool can be pale sometimes (like a yellowish color or sometimes even as light as tan, no white or clayish or black or red) but it's usually a medium brown color or light brown. My urine is nothing close to brown, so that's good I guess. Is pale or clear urine the perfect urine color? That's what I always have with some occasional dark yellow if I don't drink a lot of water. I also have been getting changes in my bowel habits. Like it can be constipation and suddenly diarrhea. The appearances change also. Like undigested food particles, changes in color (green, orange, yellow/tan, and mostly any shade of brown, rarely dark), changes in size. Abdominal pain and gas/bloating is a big one too! Hence, my speculation of colon cancer but turns out, it can just be IBS, a benign condition with the almost same symptoms. I get upper abdominal pain, mid abdominal, and lower abdominal pain. Lower and upper most often. I don't get a lot of lower right pain but more of lower left. My upper abdomen pain is usually after eating, bloating/gas, or simply constipation. All of my pain are relieved by a BM, though. I also have terrible terrible terrible terrible anxiety to add to my digestive problems. Or even maybe my anxiety is what caused the digestive problems. I noticed stress and very unhealthy foods trigger my symptoms. I wonder if this is a symptom of IBS, heard anxiety and IBS are linked. I'm a bit overweight but I did manage to lose a few pounds with eating salads and drinking plenty of water and exercise. But also this past month, I've been lacking which probably is causing more digestion issues are showing up. It's near finals and I just got over state testing. Family problems, friends, and health problems are making really depressed and making me even more stressed! I started to eat unhealthy foods again and sitting in front of my computer googling this googling that. I think that is also causing my vision to worsen and my shoulders hurting (especially right, which of course, is another symptom of liver disease). I do lean towards my left side and my right is always in the air or an awkward position which is probably why it hurts more. My hands can get red but apparently, again, everyone tells me I'm fine. Actually, my ""abnormal"" hands look very normal lol. My hands don't look extremely red, only when it's super hot. And now I'm stressing over edema. I also get indents from socks but it could be because I wear them like all day everyday. I take them off at night and the identations go away in the morning? And now that I'm stressing over my legs, especially feet and calves for any swelling/water retention, I feel like it's a little bit more swollen than better, Not much but a little bit of extra skin. I also get headaches and lightheaded a lot, usually after a stressful night or day. When I press on my calf or feet hard, it does make this pitting thingy like it would on skin. Once I release my finger, it returns to normal immediately. Like I said, I'm a bit chubby so my arms are kinda fat too, not just the feet. I also had this weird chest pain. It wasn't that painful or unbearable. Sometimes it's near the heart region which makes me scared and sometimes my armpit? Like the lymph nodes or something, I don't know. Right now, I feel full and my abdomen is a bit..big? It usually goes down after a large bowel movement or usually in the mornings, my stomach gets flatter again. I also get indigestion sometimes. Occasional upper right abdomen pain which is the reason my liver/gallbladder worries start even though the pain is very slight and dull. I don't get a lot of pain on my right side abdomen, usually the middle or left. People say I'm scaring myself with things that may be absolutely normal. I mean, I think they're right, I just can't stop all of these thoughts. My doctor told me I seem pretty healthy but that was what..4 months ago? What if an illness can suddenly all happen in 4 months. I'm 12, I don't want to have to worry about my health, well, worrying about you're health is good but probably not like this. To make matters worse, I have family history of liver disease, 99% of them due to excessive drinking. I also have family history of IBS. And my mom suffered from moderate depression and OCD when she was younger. I'm not sure about cancer, but I know there are GI disorders. Help? I know none on this website can diagnosis me but please, some opinions?

"im a 12 year old girl and lets say, my mental health is not at its best and I think it have been messing with my digestive system. Many people including my doctor thinks it's either anxiety or IBS, even both! But lately (which is a few days for me), I've been getting gallbladder/liver diseases fears. My urine is never darker than yellow, and never have been orange. My stool, however, can get pale. Usually when I have diarrhea but even just randomly sometimes! It's not white or clayish, just sometimes a paler color. Like tanish yellow or very light brown. It would usually go back to my normal light-medium brown color. I also sometimes get upper right abdomen pain but it happens after eating. Having a BM and passing gas helps a lot. pain in this area doesn't happen a lot and it's quite mild. I get lower abdomen pain and cramps A LOT, especially the lower middle and the lower left. The upper abdomen overall is what I think is due to bloating/gas. Passing gas almost always or even always relieve the pain? I sometimes get mid abdomen pain too, I don't know why. Sometimes the mid right, sometimes mid left, sometimes my belly button. I also got right shoulder pain and it's, of course, a symptom of liver disease. My parents thinks it's because of how long I spend on my computer and then ""unhealthy"" position I'm always in. I don't know why, I always find myself in a position where my left side if basically resting but my right is always in an awkward state. My parents reduce my computer time and tried fixed how I sit and I think the pain is getting better. To make matters worse, I have family history of liver disease! But 99.9% of them are due to excessive drinking. I don't drink cuz I'm barely even a teen yet. Is what I'm describing sounding like anxiety and IBS or liver/gallbladder issues? Why does my stool look lighter in the water than without? Also, I have like 4 people in my family who has IBS, my mom use daily to have depression and OCD, if that's makes anything different. My dad, he's a whole other mess. He's been getting really bad digestive issues but no cancer, he went to so many doctors and non of them can diagnosis him, it all conclude to weak stomach or something like that. I don't think there's cancer running in the family.

"I've been dealing with left lower stomach pain and soft floating stools along with diarrhea for about a year now.  It all started with a really bad case of diarrhea last summer and stomach pain that lasted for a week and ever since has reoccurred every few days (5-10 times a month).  
The pain is always located on the lower left side of my stomach and I'm sometimes very gassy and have a gurgly popping pain in that region as well.  I've lost about 25 pounds over the course of several months (some can be contributed to not eating as much due to pain and working out anymore).  I don't have any other alarm symptoms besides weight loss unless floating stools qualify.
My stools have changed to very soft stools that are often mixed between both sinking and floating in the same BM although they float the majority of the time.  On the days I have diarrhea it normally runs it course and then is over the next day only to reoccur 3-5 days later again.  I've cut out gluten and dairy for awhile and have kept a food diary but haven't figured out anything.
I did go to the doctor and ran bloodwork for celiac which was negative and had a normal colonoscopy about 6 months ago.  My doctor had recommended a HIDA scan (I don't have gallbladder type pain though).  Since I've been dealing with this for a year almost now is this just normal IBS stuff or should I get further testing done?

"Hello,
I'm a 41 yo male, healthy (don't smoke, not overweight, exercise regularly) who's suffered from IBS-A for many years.  Had a negative colonoscopy 8 yrs ago.  However over the past few weeks things seem to have worsened and I was wondering if anyone's experienced anything similar.  About two weeks ago I had what I assume was a viral stomach bug (a day of diarrhea, chills and nausea).  This only lasted about a day.  Never had any bloody stool.  Felt okay for a couple days.  But then a few days later had terrible lower abdominal cramps and had the urge to have a BM every 30 minutes or so all morning.  Since then have had pretty much constant crampy abdominal pain (mostly below my belly button but sometimes all over), bloating, some nausea, loss of appetite and even lost a few pounds because I just don't feel like eating.  The diarrhea has resolved, now just having some intermittent hard / soft stools with some mucus.  Also woke up one night in the middle of the night with cramps and had to have a BM and couldn't fall back asleep due to the cramps.  Saw my GI and had normal stool cultures (no c. diff, crypto, giardiasis or bacterial infections) and a normal CBC. i have a colonoscopy scheduled for next week but I'm freaking out about something more serious (i.e. cancer).  My wife thinks a lot of my symptoms are ""psychosomatic"" as I have a pretty strong history of anxiety.  She thinks a lot of my loss of appetite and resultant weight loss are more because of anxiety and stress.  I know it seems unlikely to develop cancer just 8 years after a normal colonoscopy but my mind likes to go to bad places  Thoughts?  Anyone else have a similar experience with a flare of post infectious IBS?  Thanks!

"Hi all, I'm getting to the bottom of this fibre ratio, so I've been having quite a few Chia Seeds, high in soluble fibre, seems to work well to stop bloating, only downside large stools pretty tough to pass, soluble fibre slows transit time, but I was ok, so now I'm adding Bran which is high in insoluble fibre and speeds up transit time, so basically I'm trying to find the right ratio of fibre, I'm trying more or less 50 50 just now, will post results for better or worse.

"you guys might know me because I post so much lol. But today, I saw a lot of red in my stool! No my stool is not red, it's more of an orange brown. I freaked out because there is this one piece that has a lot of red pieces/streaks in them. The toilet water is not red or anything, I think there is a little mucus which I get often. My stool today is not very bulky but really really long. It's extremely gross but I got so scared and decided to investigate (I used a stick...) and it looks like skin? Like red skin. I did have A LOT of tomatoes and red bell pepper yesterday. Does this sound like blood. It doesn't really look like blood to me but Im still scared. The streaks turn out to be the longer pieces of ""skin"". I feel like it's the red bell pepper. I ate half of a whole bell pepper. The red pieces float and they're really hard to break up. I'm really sure it's undigested food but of course, anxiety gotta creep in and make me freak out!

"Hi all,
I was surfing the web and stumbled across this page for a product called The SCD Lifestyle by Steve Wright.  
At first I just thought it was a blog of someone sharing his IBS-C story but as I kept reading I realized it was an advertisement for I guess a book and diet plan.  The cost was $40.00 US which is fine but when I did a search it looked like the program required customers to buy their products/supplements etc.  
Any information is greatly appreciated.

"Hi , I was recently diagnosed with IBS.
Since then my life has changed - and not by my own conscious decision .
New life:
- pain , pain pain every single day. Yes some days the cramping and the pain is better then others but can we please not categorise mild pain and nausea as a good day.
A good day before was waking up doing a bit of exercise , having an actual meal of eggs and bacon or toast and peanut butter and coffee or whatever the he'll I felt for before setting out the rest of my day.
A day not filled with pain, a day where food does feel like torture. A day that's actually filled with some brightness regardless of the plans, cos I had an able body an able gut.
I exercised by my own choice, reduced the sugar in my coffee by my own choice and ate a side of vegetables instead of oily fried chips by my own choice.
Now I don't get a choice. Eat only this and avoid anything that smells or looks delicious cos it is now bad for me.. I want to sit in my room or runaway the moment I get the smell of ""normal,regular"" food because that's what I would rather eat.
I'm not saying all vegetable , or gut friendly foods tastes bad but I did not choose to be on this overly restricting diet ! So run , hide in my room or just avoid a normal social life cos it's torture being in a room filled with able bodies enjoying life , enjoying food ...
Exercise that's supposed to help deal with my sadness. Another method that's no longer my choice but something needed to relief IBS symptoms.
IBS and symptoms and diet and information and home remedies and this medication or that article or this website.... This is my new days. Nothing about this is bright. It's not a good day cos the level of cramping is less or because the meal I eaten was prepared excellently.
There is never a good day with IBS. It's just a new life. A life filled with rules and symptoms and diets. A life that ""happiness"" or brightness has to be measured on a different scale to regular normal way of life cos essentially nothing can compare to the freedom of your own meal and absolutely no pain.
So be grateful for my ""good""days. Keep to my diet cos the cramping has reduced. Some how bring myself to exercise to control my anxiety to reduce a possibility of a flare up. An IBS full day and let's not forget about my constant occurring yest infection. .
I am struggling and I'm afraid to accept this as my new life. I miss my life.

"Hi, I’m a 45 year old female. Lately I’ve been having pain in my lower left side and sometimes goes to the right side. For the last few weeks when I go to the bathroom I feel like I can’t empty my bowels completely. Also my stools are hard and sometimes followed by mucus. I went to the gastro and after a few questions he said I have IBS. I asked if I could have a colonoscopy and he said didn’t recomend because I had no family history. I have another appointment wit another gastro next week, but I’m really scared. A year ago I felt the same pain which went away by itself. But since maybe 2 months ago my bowels changed and that is driving me crazy. Do you guys have similar experiences ? Oh, I also have back pain that irradiates to my leg.

"I'm in my early 20s and have had IBS for years, but the most recent flare up has lasted for about 3 years (the longest one I've had!). I manage it with low-fodmap diet etc, but still often get constipation and diarrhoea. 
I've had blood when I go to the toilet a lot over the last couple of years (I'd say about half the time), and have been to the doctor about it and it doesn't seem to be haemorrhoids or a fissure. I'm currently waiting to have a colonoscopy, but today there was more blood than usual, with clots in it - so now I'm a bit worried!
I was just wondering if anyone else with IBS gets regular bleeding or if it's likely to be ulcerative colitis or some other kind of IBD. also just if I should be worried / do anything about it before I have this colonoscopy?

"So I've read a few posts on the forum that relate to this topic, but haven't really answered my questions, so am hoping somebody will be able to help me out? I'm 18 years old and for the past few months, I haven't had a ""proper"" period as such. I randomly get spots of brownish coloured blood, but nothing major, (TMI I know) but this then isn't followed by an actual period? Coincidentally, I've been having IBS symptoms that have started around the same time as my periods messing up, and whenever I am ""due on"", that's when I get a bout of diarrhea (but this isn't sustained, I'll get diarrhea once and then thats it). I already know that periods can make IBS worse, but that's not what I want to learn about more. I want to know if anyone knows of whether or not IBS (diarrhea predominantly) can be CAUSED by periods/hormonal imbalances etc and whether or not IBS symptoms can be confused with something that is actually more to do with menstruation.

"Hi,
I've had IBS for jus over a coupleasure of years. I suffer with loose stools and diarrhea a lot, and take immodium a few times a week if it's bad. I've been off work this week so am having a break from taking the immodium. Over the last 6 days however, I have not been able to stop pooping all day long. I'll get most of it out in the morning, but for the whole of the rest of the day I keep getting cramps and feeling a despray urge to go. When I get to the toilet I feel blocked up, have a lot of wind and then usually pass a tiny stool, which is sometimes very watery, sometimes just mucus, but then sometimes it's solid. I might have a bout of diarrhea a bit later in the day, then it goes back to being more solid.
All day long though I have a constant feeling like I need to go, and I am passing stools literally 15 times each day. Each time I go, I still don't feel empty, and can get stomach pains straight away after I suffer from bad anxiety so I am wondering if this could be causing this as it's on my mind all the time. I can't concentrate on anything else.
It's really worrying me that this is never going to stop, or that I'm causing some damage to my bowels by going to the toilet so often. It has completely ruined my week off from work and I've got a wedding to go to next weekend and I am really anxious that this will stop me going.
I'm not sure whether I should take some immodium to stop it, or if that would make matters worse.
I would really appreciate some advice.
Thanks

"Hello, first time posting here, I hope someone has advice for me.
I do suffer from hypochondria so as some of you may know any little pain will send me into panic. 
Since a couple of years ago I was 'diagnosed' with IBS. As in, not much testing apart from a blood and stool test and hearing my symptoms out. 
Two weeks ago I started having this dull ache in my right side and abdomen. And it was *constantly* there. I'd say it was 2 from a 10 scale. It was mainly my side and it radiated towards my hip, back and towards the center of my abdomen sometimes. Anyway go to the doctor, get a pelvic exam, doc says it's just my bowels acting up. Blood test and urine test (for smth else) come back normal.

I know this sounds stupid to a lot of you who luckily don't suffer from health anxiety, but all my brain is saying yep your colon is getting blocked by a tumor, that's why the constant pain in one place I both want to and don't want to go back to the GP, but I'm pretty sure they'll just roll their eyes at me and tell me not to waste their time. Which I feel I do, even though I don't see them that often! 
I just want advice, I'm pretty sure IBS flare ups shouldn't last for weeks

"Good afternoon..Here I am writing my IBS journey and what I hv learned through my personal experience.. If  this might help someone in a little manner also, I will feel I did something right.
So I was diagnosed with IBS-predominantly constipation type around 9 months ago.  Before that I had to go through so many tests and antibiotics courses as IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion.So once everything was rued out including my small intestinal biopsy result was non specific, I was given diagnosis of IBS for my symptoms like changing bowel habits between constipation and diarrhea, Bloating, feeling tired and muscle aches and also some unexplained rashes and trouble in concentrating and also couldn't control my anger( Yes that is a symptom)...I believe so many people might be going through the same or more who are suffering from IBS.
Concurrently, I was found severely deficient in vitamin D and vitamin B12 and also had moderate gastritis....So I was started on supplements...after which I felt GReat....But to my surprise I noticed that now I can not tolerate gluten...I was tested for gluten sensitivity also but the test came negative but somehow My intestine can not tolerate wheat and as soon as I eat Wheat I feel bloated and I hv to go to toilet to relieve my bloating...So At the time of my diagnosis I had those symptoms every day....But now I get it once in a few months...It has reduced significantly.....Now I will let you kw how...
So, First of all Thanks to my doctor who didn't even treat my symptoms of IBS but he also focused on treating me as a whole...As he was very well aware of the gut mind connection....So my doctor gave me one mild dose of anti depressant and advised me to have some yoga and meditation classes along with IBS treatment....For my constipation he prescribed me ISABGOL...very effective...It helped me a lot in my constipation and I still take it...It is very safe to take...and some anti spasmodic...
Guys, I am a medical student and may be I was overly sensitive towards my illness and the medications I was taking and I knew there is no absolute cure for IBS in allopathy as it was all symptomatic Rx, I decided to go to Ayurvedic doctor....And whatever the medicine I was prescribed by my Ayurvedic doctor, It did wonder for me... I still have 1 year course of those medications left....But I am feeling well now...well I was advised to eat anything I like but I didn't feel good after eating wheat so I still avoid it and try to experiment with my food....
 So few things I have learned through my illness especially IBS and also helped me in my illness;
1. stay happy and keep your mind calm..Do yoga/ meditation...(As there is connection between gut and mind)
2. Antidepressant does help as it contains serotonin which is common chemical in brain and gut.
3.keep your vitamins level in appropriate range.( It helps with the energy)
4. Be mindful what you eat...your body will tell you what it likes and doesn't like you just need to pay attention after eating...If u eat something and after eating feel good and your mood is elevated then that food is good for you and If you feel down after eating certain foods avoid those food...your body doen't like it...you just have to be mindful you will know immediately. I prefer to Eat every 2 hourly that provides me energy to go through the day joyfully.
5. Isabgol is wonderful for relieving constipation. Don't take it during diarrhea episode.
6. Take good care of your gut's healthy bacteria..they are also your family..This is very important for any gut related issue or so many other illnesses... we don't pay much attention to it and take it for granted...but not now...So eat yogurt everyday, if it is not contraindicated like lactose intolerance etc.
7. I am myself a medical student and I do believe in medicines but with my personal experience I hv realized that we are more responsible for betterment of ourselves than our doctors...Stay informed and change your lifestyle...Total lifestyle change is the key.
I am writing this article because when I was in dilemma about my diagnosis, I went through so many forums finding answers and searching for people who was suffering from the same illness...Reading about complains and their solutions gave me relief and I could find my life again ,back on the track...so I think I owe those people who take time to write on these kind of forums and gave us strength...

"Hi. I'm wondering If IBS can cause this onion-ish smell in stool. I just had a quite large BM. It was a bit flat, but the width is normal. The color is light brown/medium. I don't see blood or any odd with it except flat stool but I had that before and apparently it's a sign of IBS. I think I had this oniony smell from my stool. It's not excessively bad, just has more of an onion/smellier smell than usual. My dad gets this a lot, actually. I heard diarrhea can cause the smell but my stool is formed. My anxiety is acting up again because I read someone's comment somewhere about how her mom has colon cancer and had blood in her stool which would smell like onion.

"Hi,
I sometimes drink a fybogel orange sachet just before bedtime for IBS-C. I say sometimes, because, usually I eat a couple of slices of papaya and it does the trick.
So, I only use fybogel, if I haven't bought papaya (or don't have a ripe one to hand). Anyway, they are both just as effective. Recently, I ran out of the fybogel sachets and they are not available in pharmacies/chemists in Vietnam. So, went online and searched. Pretty much all the sellers shipping to Vietnam have only the Fybogel in a container. Not the sachet type. See pic attached:
Has anyone used this? It says on the container use a spoonful (5.4g) with 150 ml of water. I was wondering how many doses can you get from one container?
It says 100g on the container, so it should be over 15 doses right? (the container must weigh at least 10g). I just can't work out how it can hold even 10 doses, because the container is so small. The picture is nowhere to scale.

My dad was diagnosed with IBS when he was a teenager.   So that runs in the family.  My symptoms are:  bloating, acid reflux, feeling full easily, having to use the bathroom right after eating sometimes, fatigue, gas, and my stools are interesting.  Everybody says with ibs you have diarrhea or constipation.  My stools are consistently the same, they’re in the shape of normal stools but they look like they’re not so structurally together.   And when I flush the toilet they sorta mix in with the water.  It’s not diarrhea because it’s not just liquid and they hold a shape.  Does anybody else have this?

"I have been struggling with ibs-c for about 4 years now. Lately, it is much more bloating and slow digestion than constipation. It is very painful and uncomfortable all the time. I have tried everything for help (prescription laxatives, colonoscopy, ultrasound, sibo test, diet, etc). I have been trying to avoid taking antidepressants, and I think it's just because I am in denial that I may actually need them. But after trying everything else, this feels like my last real chance at getting some relief.
I'm feeling anxious that it may not help. I have read some reviews and don't feel very confident. I was wondering if anyone could tell me their experience with SSRI's for treating IBS, specifically constipation. How long did it take to start seeing improvements? Did you have side effects and did they go away eventually? What dosage best helped alleviate your symptoms? Did it help your mood at all too? Thoughts on zoloft to treat ibs-c?

"Hi Everybody,
First time on the forum. I've been a long time gut sufferer with IBS for over 15 years. I've been down every road as many of you have as well.  Recently I've been trying work with a SIBO diagnosis as well. I live in Canada, and in Toronto it feels things have been moving very slowly with gut issues that don't fall under a Crohns umbrella. SIBO and IBS we all know could or can be very closely entwined. I feel strongly that motility is a major factor and further more bacteria and the trouble that come from where they are in the gut.
I know the topic of IBS has many angles to it. The one I'm focusing on is the bacterial side of it. What brings me here is that I wanted to put out there to Canadians that I have petition to get Rifaxamin an indication for IBS. I know that it's under review right now for this indication and though it may not be right some people it is a strong tool for others - if they can afford it. That's all I'm trying to do - get health canada to review the request with a more compassionate lens.

I wish you all well and hope for science to catch up with one of the worst scenarios in life - a badly functioning gut.
If the group wishes to be apart of the petition let me know. The government responds to groups better than individuals.

"Hi,
Can anyone help advise how they got to the bottom of the food/ingredient causing their IBS? My symptoms are severe nausea and loose stools. Are there any clinics out there that can work with you to figure it out?
I have tried elimination diet of what I think it could be but then still have flare ups. I tried the FODMAP diet previously before for a short time however I am so scarily underweight because of this and struggle to put weight on. I am 27 years old! I can't afford to cut out loads of foods like the FODMAP diet requires you to do. When I have a bad flare up with nausea and loose stools, I feel like on those days I don't eat much, I actually lose some weight!

"I know some people might already be tried of me posting but I'm trying to see if anyone else is experiencing the same thing, get some advice, and just overall, learn more about IBS and symptoms of it. Ok so for the past week or so, I've been experiencing constipation. The pieces are either small and pebbly, small and thin, or just a thick log (not very long) that's hard to push. I having some diarrhea too but I still feel like my bowel is still not emptying fully. It sometimes not the size but the amount recently. More come out with diarrhea but it doesn't fully come out in one go. I found myself having to go multiple times a day but can only poop out a smallish amount every time. My stool color right now is about medium brown, not dark dark but a bit darker than the light brown stool I've been experiencing (ugh, blood in stool scares again even though I never see obvious blood). So yea, anxiety acting up, got extremely stressed last night, diarrhea in the morning (just not complete but about 80-90%?). It really annoying how my brain always thinks of worst-case scenarios like cancer, or something extremely serious. Help? Still haven't been officially diagnosed with IBS, yet.

"Hi well I never thought I'd be posting on this group again after two years of being ibs free apart from a couple of bouts which I could handle. Six weeks ago a flare up started out of no where (I since remember having a strong coffee that I never drink which could be the cause). I thought it was another quick one but this lasted till last week. The pain became unbearable. I became a pain at work and a pain to my family. I was sinking and I started to drink to try and take away the pain. Bad move. In the end I broke down in the Dr's and was put on a course of setreline 50mg and signed off work for 2 weeks. I am quite an anxious lad and I guess this along with my diet, drink and stress took its toll. The last week has been a blur as anyone on sertraline would know. I have gone to try and repair my system with plain foods for a few weeks and hopefully the meds will cure my anxiety and calm me down.

"for the last ten years or so , I have had bouts of extremely painful trapped wind. It used to be only a few times a year but has for the last few years been once or twice a month or sometimes more. It starts after I have woken up and got out of bed. I can feel like a curl of discomfort in my stomach which gets more and more pronounced as time goes by. It builds up in intensity until I’m unable to walk unless doubled over and it makes me moan continually! I’ve tried everything, sipping cooled boiled water, colpermin, ginger, ginger /peppermint tea, peppermint, Rennes, deflatine, Andrews, gaviscon, bending over, squatting, ....pretty much every preparation on the market. Except buscopan, which I have just bought and not yet tried. My question is this, what causes this? I’ve read that swallowing air does it. I’ve tried not to do this but I’m not sure if this is what does it . I eat slowly and chew well. It doesn’t happen specifically after a particular food like beans. I eat broccoli regularly so it doesn’t correspond with that. My GP suggested I had IBS years ago before this started and I’ve not wanted to bother them with this particular problem. My stomach has been better from an IBS point of view since I started eating kefir probiotic. Things have calmed down considerably , the shifting feeling when I lie down in bed, the noises, I’m more regular too, so I continue with the kefir daily. But it has not stopped the trapped wind, it is driving me mad, I’m starting to not want to get out of bed in the morning because I’m afraid to feel that curling feeling!  Oh, and as time goes by I can feel it start to move very gradually , until after 24 - 36 hours later, I feel it leaving me.... Has anyone else had this experience? Any tips? Thanks for reading. J.

"I just has soft, mushy, and loose stool, not watery however. It has the poop smell. But when I was wiping and examine to see any signs of something different like blood (I always do this,  it gives me anxiety but I still can't help it sometimes). I guess I was too close (ew) and smelt the poo. It smells a bit weirder, I wouldn't say foul or super bad smelling. I can't describe it but I guess it smells like iron? Well actually, maybe not iron, iron (I might have to check again in the next BM). I just can't really explain it. Again, I don't see blood, just the smell. Does this happen to anyone else? Especially when they have diarrhea? When I'm constipated, it doesn't really smell.

"I started having lower abdominal pain in the middle of my lower abdomen. The first few days it didn't go away no matter what. I passed gas and had bowel movements but it wouldn't go away. Now it seems to just come and go. I was diagnosed with ibs 5 years ago after a colonoscopy showed no polyps or anything wrong. The only bleeding I've has has been determined to be hemorrhoids and I only get dark black looking stool after drinking too much grape juice in which it goes back to normal after a few days. I have all of the other ibs symptoms and have had lower abdominal pain before but it was never like this and never lasted this long. Has anyone else with ibs ever have lower abdominal pain that lasted for thks long of a time before? Is this just a new symptom of ibs I'm having?

"Hello, 
Last time I got bad pain I was advised to get Buscopan - it was in the left hand side - and it did sort it out.  Started being ""active"" on Friday with LS ++ had an off colour weekend, but bowels have settled.  But I have had a weird pain, felt a bit like period pains - I had the menopause 10yrs ago - and Buscopan hasn't really helped much.  Today it started very low across the bikini line, weird gripy, didn't respond to Buscopan, by this afternoon it is on the right side of my Belly button, the rest is just a dull ache, but my Belly button feels like I have a waistband digging in - that type of discomfort, like a pinch.  OK when up and around, just general discomfort, but when I sit it is a nasty little dig.  I have been wearing my loosest joggers so I know my waistband isn't digging in but it sure as hell is annoying me.  Its like a thumbnail size area.
Is this related to my IBS?  Has anybody had this kind of discomfort before?  Am going to try Nurofen Plus with buscopan to see if I get any relief.
Thank you in advance x

"OK....
I am a born worrier.  Don't know why but I have always been a glass half empty type of person.  So after numerous investigations this year my GP finally diagnosed me with IBS.  I had for years and years suffered with varying bowel habits, including urgency.....much urgency!!  But never had pain until last year.
In March got some Buscopan for lower left sided pain and it did the trick after a day or 2.  Been OK since until last week when I started I think Friday with urgency then the next day vague abdo pain across the belly, although the bowels settled.
Since then:
Extremely tired - have actually gone to bed for an hour each afternoon I am so shattered
(never ever do this)
Very little energy so have done very little other than walk the dog and mooch around.
Pain (was sharp stab but felt quite shallow) in belly button which I posted about the other day - has now disappeared thankfully.
Pain *gripy dull constant ache) in left side, now not being helped by Buscopan
Pain across the very very bottom of my belly - feels like when you are a bit constipated and get that dull ache - but also down into my nether regions - like you get with a UTI but I haven't got one - drinking lots and piddling clear
Piddling more than usual - having to get up during the night.  
Very poor appetite.  Just want to nibble on comfort things but think also that is partially because I don't feel up to standing and preparing a meal
Under bra strap bloating.  Feels so uncomfortable until I take my bra off.
I am just a bit worried because normally I suffer with bowels rather than pain.....and these symptoms are a bit out of the blue.  I haven't even bothered putting make up on or going anywhere.
I have made an appointment with GP for next Saturday 28th, but I know I will worry until then - does this all sound like IBS that I have been lucky to avoid until now?  And should I ask him for anything specific?  I have looked at Fodmap - and to be fair I tend to eat mainly low anyway.
Thank you in advance x

"im 14 and I'm a girl. Im waiting for a diagnostic of IBS so I still have a little doubt and worries. Ok so I was looking at colon cancer symptoms and those things (my anxiety is REALLY affected now and my symptoms is a bit worst from the amount of stress). It's says lump in the abdomen is a symptom so I started feeling my abdomen. Well I found that my right abdomen part is slight firmer than left. I'm kinda constipated and can't really empty my bowels. I couldn't find a ""lump"", it's the whole side that's firmer than the left. Does this happen to anyone else? I'm a bit scared.

"Hi, I'm a 14-year-old girl and I'm waiting for my results (everyone I asked and even my doctor is suspecting IBS). Ok so today, I had a BM and I saw these dark bits in my stool. The stool is not dark or black or red. It is kinda orange-brown? So well this morning, I had slight diarrhea, I didn't see any of the black bits, however. But my most recent bowel movement had lots of these black/dark bits. It's not really specks, more like ""strings"" (not sure how to describe it) and the sizes vary. I'm scared its blood or something like that. I did have lots of dark leafy foods and the bits does looks like chewed up, undigested food. But I'm still a bit worried and stressed. I occasionally get specks too. Would this be bleeding or just food I ate?

"Last month after jogging i felt a dull pain in my lower right abdomen that did not go away. The first gastroenterologist i went to acted like she didn't really care and just gave me meds for gas which did not work.
I went to a different doctor and she was nicer, she told me to do some work ups, i have done blood tests, urinalysis, pelvic ultrasound, abdominal ultrasound, whole abdomen ct scan, gastroscopy and colonoscopy, all of which were normal/clear.
She put me on antibiotics for a week and meds for my GERD for two weeks, i have had gerd since 2007, the pain went away for about a week but came back. My doctor was out of the country when the pain came back so i went to a different doctor, He told me take Pantoprazole and Domperidone and spasmomen for 2 weeks, he suspects it's a movement problem. The meds help a little, sometimes theres dull pain, sometimes i feel nothing. The past few days i noticed that i feel the dull pain at night before going to bed, the pain moves to the left side now too. I have no diarrhea, I have no problems with bowel movement, i do that normally every morning. I plan to go back to my original doctor this week since she is back from her trip.
About the same time when i felt the pain in my stomach last month, i saw a bald spot on my head. About the size of a coin which freaked me out of course. The dermatologist said its alopecia areata. My thyroid was checked and it was normal, which is good news because it means the cause of my alopecia was stress and not something serious. Hair is starting to grow back in that spot now.
In the middle of going back and forth to the doctor last month, one night at home, i had a panic attack. I haven't had a panic attack in years and i had one again because of this. Maybe it was the stress of not knowing what was wrong, the stress of going back and forth and doing a ton of tests.
Since january, its been stressful and tiring at work. I have read articles that stress can cause tummy aches.
I am holding on to the fact that it's nothing serious because all of my tests are normal. But it would still be good to know what's causing the dull pain. I try not to think about it anymore, trying to live my life the way it was before all these happened.
Has anyone experienced something similar to this? It's very frustrating. I'm thinking could it be IBS? I am also thinking of talking to a psychiatrist, maybe it's all in my head? But how can it be all in my head when i am feeling physical pain.

"Hi All
I Have been diagnosed with IBS, which has generally alternated from constipation to diarrhoea, however in recent weeks this has changed to sort of merge in to the two. Let me explain.
I am quite regular when I pass stools, however I only ever go every 2 to 3 days on average. However when I do go there is always a sense of urgency and I do get lower abdominal pains. Stools themselves are very watery to begin with, almost like the end of Picolax bowel prep when having a colonoscopy, which is then followed by loose stools, following this I've sometimes had bright red blood. These bouts leave me feeling generally very ill and terrible for about a day, and then it seems to ease, until I need to go again. I would like to add that when I do have one of these bouts, I only ever pass stools once, not many times as most IBS-D sufferers have to endure.
I had a colonoscopy a few months ago with biopsies taken, and apparently my colon, rectum and terminal ileum looked very healthy, no visible problems, and the biopsies came back clear, the only thing found was haemorrhoids, and from what I saw quite prominent ones as well, so the bleeding is pretty much guaranteed to be that. What I'm querying is the not going for a few days, then when I do pass stools its watery diarrhoea, and I only have to go once that is making me question my diagnosis of IBS.
Does anyone else go through these sorts of episodes? I would be interested to know other peoples experiences, especially if they are similar to mine.
Any thoughts, views and comments would be greatly appreciated.

"Really hoping someone will read this and be able to help. For the past 18 months I've been experiencing discomfort in my back passage. When I first went to doctor I was told it was piles. I was given cream and sent on my way. The cream did nothing so I went back and was given fybogel and still no improvement. I had a colonoscopy late last year which showed nothing. One doctor even tried treating me for prostatitis again to no avail. I really am going out of my mind now.
So my symptoms are a constant ache and feeling of pressure in my back passage. I do get piles come down when I pass a motion but they always retract after. I get intermittent itching sometimes severe to the point of making myself bleed. I have had a dre as recent as last week to check my prostate and wasn't told I he felt any abnormalities.
I also have aching that seems to radiate into my legs and can make them very restless specially at night.
I really don't know what to do anymore, I suffer with health anxiety anyway which I'm sure exacerbates the problem but no pain killers or treatment is working.

"Hello all.  I'm a 36 year old male living in The States and I've suffered with GI issues since I was a teenager.  In 2002 I had my gallbladder removed which I think was the beginning of the end.  Unfortunately I think my issues are the aftermath of yo yo dieting, diet pills and anorexia in my teenage years.
Though my symptoms have changed over the years, I currently suffer from constipation, gas bloating, and cramps.
For the most part I seldom get the urge to go to the bathroom.  If I let the problem go and don't use medicine, I typically feel uncomfortably full and have a heavy feeling all day, I usually won't eventually go.  
Usually, to alleviate the issue, or prevent it from happening, and have a bowel movement in the morning, I either take senna or some type of over the counter colon cleansing/laxative agent the night before, or take mineral oil and or a stool softener the night before.  I've also, in the past, tried Amatiza, Linzess, Movantic and trulance.  
Recently I've started to combine the use of tap water enemas with using suppositories- as the med's/supplement oftenbcause diarreah. 
Though I'm often able to relieve some of my constipation, the second part of my problem is that I'm often gassy, bloated, and  cramped.  I know it seems these symptoms are due to the constipation or meds but I'm noticing even when I do happen to go to the bathroom without ""assistance,"" I still experience gas bloating, cramps, etc.  the gas I have is moreso intestinal, it's not just farting a lot (to put it bluntly).  It sloshes around in my gut and feels like marbles traveling through a tube.  My pains/cramps are typically in my upper right abdomen or my lower left side near my peivic bone.  Sometimes the gas causes the pain and sometimes it doesn't.  I notice the enemas cause more of these symptoms than the medicine.  Sometimes it feels like the water is still stuck up there even after I expell it.
All in all, the only time I feel somewhat normal is when I do not eat.  For example, if I want to go out on a Saturday night and not feel bloated, cramps, etc, I'd have to fast all day Saturday.
I know I have two separate issues going on, however, At this point, I feel like if I was able to have a complete bowel movement some of these symptoms would subside.  I've had every test and nothing is ever found.
My question to readers is: are there any recommendations to help with constipation (whether it's medicine, supplements,  home remedies, etc.) that could help prevent the constipation but not flare up the other symptoms. Ideally something that will just make me ""regular."" 
I am absolutely desperate and welcome any input.

"So about 3 months ago I ended up getting a random sharp pain in my lower left abdomen, didn’t think anything of it until later that night I went out for a birthday party and ended up having a really upset stomach and diarrhea. Symptoms persisted so I went and seen my GP and was told just a stomach bug, had a follow up with no changes so I got blood work, urine, and stool tests done everything came back good. Symptoms getting worse as the weeks went by, I had persistent pain in my lower left abdomen, slight change in stool so I went to the emergency room and had a CT scan done, blood work again, and X-rays with all results coming back clear. They didn’t find anything wrong with me but suggested I go see a GI doctor. Scheduled an appt and the first thing doctor told me is I have ibs and prescribed me bentyl, with my symptoms not getting any better and having trouble sleeping at night now because the pain would wake me up in the middle of the night I went and seen another GI, had an colonoscopy done and it came back clear. He took tissue sample for biopsy but haven’t gotten the results back. He diagnosed me with a spastic colon, told me to keep taking the bentyl because it will help. I feel pretty good during the day but it’s at night where my symptoms get worse, I wake up in the middle of the night with this pain in my lower left abdomen, it’s like someone is squeezing my colon or as if I have a knot there that isn’t relieved no matter what I do. Can anyone relate to this?

"I was diagnosed with Barrett's back in 2015 following an endoscopy. I used to get bad indigestion and burning in my chest. I had a two year check in December 17 and was told that the Barrett's was about the same but I also had a hiatus hernia. Biopsies were taken which showed no cancer. I also suffer from IBS.
?In the last four weeks my symptoms have been getting worse and apart from constant indigestion (despite taking Pantoprazole 40mg a day and Gaviscon) I am now getting pains in my stomach and trapped wind which is really painful. I used to have a healthy appetite but this has reduced and I now get pains after meals but only eat small portions as feel full pretty quickly. I do sometimes feel sick but not enough to think I will vomit. I haven't so far lost weight but with my meal reductions this could follow and my bowel movements are not unusual. 
?I guess I will go back to my GP who will tell me that as the last endoscopy was clear, it is either my Barrett's playing up or my IBS and send me away. I haven't had pains like this before, obviously my mind thinks of stomach cancer as some of the symptoms match but as I have had an endoscopy would this be picked up with that ?
?I just wondered if anyone on here who suffers with IBS had something similar.  Thanks.

"So my symptoms started a few months back. I started noticing my symptoms and googled it and one condition that keeps popping up is IBS. I got curious and decided to learn more about it and the symptoms and so far, I have ALL of the most common symptoms. I have frequent alternating between constipation and diarrhea. I learned that mental health problems can affect this and for the pass year or so, I've been feeling more worried, stresssed, and not always happy (sometimes easily irritated). I took quizzes to see if I have anxiety and if it's mild or bad and I also searched symptoms of it and it seems like I have pretty bad anxiety problems. And also, the biggest trigger of my anxiety is the fact that my symptoms could also indicate colon cancer and I'm getting really anxious because of how similar symptoms of IBS and colon cancer are. The only difference is that I don't really see any trace of blood in my stool (a few weeks ago, I wiped and saw a little bit of blood so I go at mirror and saw that I have a cut right next to my butthole but I think it healed), I don't really have anemia(not sure what that is either), no unintended weight loss, no fever or constant fatigue (I do get tired sometimes but it's from staying up late on my phone, I trying to stop though). I do have abdominal pain and it would decrease from a bowel movement but it would keep lingering on for a few more minutes because going away. The pain is usually lower abdomen or lower left abdomen (especially when I'm constipated). Sometimes even upper but only occasionally. I also noticed undigested food like red bits that look like tomato skin, onion skin like pieces, sometimes black specks when I wipe, and these mucus thingy (more water kinda help reduce mucus in my stool, I noticed). I'm only 12 (I'm slightly overweight by a few pounds but not much) I think I had some medical history with constipation that my doctor said is nothing serious, which was a few years ago. I don't have anyone in my family who have any sort of cancer I pretty sure. But there is a gene of digestive problems on my dad side but they aren't anything too serious either. So yea, I have all of the symptoms for IBS and now I'm trying to be more active, eat more healthy. Not sure if Its working yet because I'm still lacking a bit but I'm trying. I exercise more frequently and I think it isn't working a bit but not a lot because I've started just recently (probably a week or so). Im really scared and I feel like the anxiety is really triggering my symptoms like yesterday I was really stressed and then I had pretty bad bloating and gas but it could also be from the amount of ice cream and dairy products I consumed. But anyways, I'm really hoping it's not cancer or anything life threatening. I'm too scared to tell me parents but I know I will tell them soon. Sorry you had to read this really long paragraph but please reply if you can!!

"Hi! I'm writing because like many of you, I'm at wit's end and I want to see if anyone has any suggestions. 
I'm a 34-year old Canadian who has had a sensitive digestive symptom my entire adult life. Mostly I'd have frequent bouts of diarrhea, fissures, intense bloating, stomach aches, gas and occasionally, heartburn.
1.5 years ago, I had an episode where I woke up in the middle of the night, nauseous and insanely hungry which no food could satiate. I had something very vinegary that night and believe I picked up a stomach bug from my nephew. A month later, my stomach was still sensitive so I took Pantoprazole for a month without any noticeable issues. Abdominal ultrasound returned unremarkable.
10 months ago, my stomachaches got worse and the weird hunger pangs started again. The dr. prescribed Zantac and Pantoprazole. After upping to a high dosage on my dr's recommendation, I started experiencing really bad acid reflux and non-stop belching. It felt like a bubble was over my chest, I had trouble swallowing food and I lost quite a bit of weight. I stopped it about 3 weeks later after a colonoscopy/endoscopy returned normal except for some mild inflammation in my colon. But since then, I have had daily digestive issues with alternating symptoms between upper and lower GI tract.
I'm seeing a Gastroentologist but I've come to the conclusion that he will not help me.
My symptoms over the last 10 months:
Constant symptoms
* Violent burping. Loud, large, long embarrassing burps. Sometimes, I get the sensation of a burp spasm in my upper abdomen but air does not expel. Occasional hiccuping too. 
* Nausea, often after eating or drinking lots of water. Can be relieved with burping. So I believe it's from trapped gas.
* Low satiety. I'm often hungry after eating.
* Lots of undigested food in my stool
* Alternating between loose (but not diarrhea) stools and constipation but having daily bowel movements
* Intense bloating
* Extremely loud stomach which makes very squelching, sloshing and other noises
* Feeling of liquid in my nasal cavity
Occasional symptoms
* Mucus in stool or pellet-like stools
* Heartburn 
* Reflux
* Swallowing problems - food feels stuck in my chest - which seems to happen when my reflux is bad
* Intense hunger pangs which get bad when I have ingested something acidic like an apple, red wine and vinegar. But it can happen even without acidic food, especially when I wake up. Food doesn't usually help. Having a bowel movement can sometimes help. I don't experience this symptom all the time.
* Left-side pain
What I've tried (nothing has helped so far):
* FODMAP diet and Gluten Free/SCD diet, eliminated all refined carbs, fruits, added sugar. (with the help of a dietitian). Sadly, other than acidic foods causing me hunger pangs sometimes, no pattern to food and disturbances to my tract.
* Probiotics (Florastor and Bio-K). Trying align right now
* Meditation
* Naturopathy (I'm skeptical but I may try a different one again)
* Acupuncture
* Aloe Vera
* Apple cider vinegar
* Allimed, oregano oil
* Digestive Enzymes
* HCL
* Domperidone, Metoclopramide. The former made me feel worse
* Pantoprazole
* Iberogast 
Currently trying Nexium (on day 4) but I'm actually quite scared to be taking it given the last reaction I had to a PPI. I've decided to trial it for 2 weeks. On the diet front, I'm mostly eating chicken, fish, zucchini, spinach, bananas, oatmeal. My reflux has been better the last couple of weeks but it seems to come and go. I still have the feeling of liquid going up my nasal cavity sometimes.
I'm a normal weight (it's been fluctuating but I haven't lost significant amounts), BMI of 19.5, fit body type, very active (not as much of late) but I do love carbs/sugar/salt. About 2 months after the digestion issues got really bad, I started also getting irregular periods after having experienced regular ones my entire life. I was later diagnosed with bilateral polycystic ovaries but I don't know if I have PCOS or just PCO.
Friends/family are concerned and are suggesting different things like body detox, colonics, chinese medicine, iridology, naturopathy, and more. I'm not really sure what to do at this point. Anyone have any suggestions as to what could be the problem? And potential solutions. 
A few things I've though about:
* Diabetes? Dr is checking right now and I don't think I have it, my blood sugar was low last year. But reading up on PCOS, it makes me wonder if insulin issues could be contributing
* Hormonal problems??
* SIBO??? Gastroentologist was dismissive. What is the likelihood of me having this after my PPI bout?
* Malfunctioning sphincter?
* I've also have had significant anxiety since these issues started last year and I cannot stop thinking about it. I've stopped obsessively looking for symptoms and potential causes but the burping especially has really impacted my social life and the nausea means I can't exercise like I used to. I started Zoloft but worried about the effect on my brain, I stopped it pretty soon after. I wondered if the burping was due to stress but I don't think so.
Thanks for reading this long long message.

"for a while now have had problems with constipation it's due to the medications I take for blood pressure. I have tried over the counter stool softeners, which relieved the constipation song however it had to be a nightly thing as well as taken Metamucil. Then in mid summer of 2017 I started having nausea, abdominal pain, cramping and contacted my gastroenterologist. He thought that my problems could be related to problems with my High hernia. Tested for that with an upper GI everything look good so then he diagnosed as me with IBS with severe constipation. He then gave me a high strength of Linzess and that cause diarrhea with severe cramping. I went back to him he ordered a CT scan of my abdomen for nausea and constipation. Test came back good , so they're just going to treat me with a lower dose. So far not helped wth the cramping and lower back pain.

"Hi,
Here looking for some answers.
In September, I had a gastroenteritis sort of bug. Symptoms were diarrhoea, bloating, cramping, sweating, and there was a night where I woke up with an itchy rash that quickly died down. I had no appetite and lost weight. It lasted 3 weeks, maybe slightly longer. I felt very drained. No vomiting, though. Eventually, I felt better.
Months after, I have experienced IBS symptoms. Just a dodgy stomach, really, waking up with quite an unsettled stomach in the morning and after dinner sometimes. 
I had a stool test to test for things like E-Coli, Campylobacter I assume. All came back clear - I had none of it.
So, what could it have been? Not knowing is what worries me. 
Kind regards.

"I’m a 35 year old female. I exercise regularly and no serious heath concerns. I am on Zoloft 100mg for anxiety, and I’m also on the Nuvaring.
10 years ago I had a colonoscopy because I had some bloody stool and all came back clear.
I have had IBS type symptoms my whole life. Nervous stomach so to speak - running to the bathroom frequently when anxious or upset. 
Lately I’ve been SUPER gassy, and it stinks too, lol. It’s usually fine in the morning but then bad at night. I cannot for the life of me Make a connection with food. I am gluten free, don’t drink, eat very little dairy and eat healthy overall.
I also tend to use the restroom frequently, 2-4 times per day although not “big” bowl movements necessarily. Like today I’ve gone 3 times already at 4pm. They were normal but just not big if that makes sense.
Trying to figure out if A) this soundslike typical IBS  and/or B)I should try to see a gastro?  I do have terrible health anxiety/hypochondria already which makes this worse. I don’t have diarrhea often but do occasionally get it for no real reason (but not frequently).

"Hi all,
I suffer from IBS-D. I go to the bathroom 4-5 times in the morning. Each time I release a large amount of loose stool (not diarrhea). I then take my Lomotil which stops me from going for the rest of the day. If I don’t take the Lomotil, I will continue to go to the bathroom throughout the day. 
Here’s my problem: on Thursdays, I start work very early in the morning and when I wake up that early, my bowels are not “ready” to move. So I take the Lomotil and go to work but because I have not expelled that morning’s stool, the Lomotil doesn’t work and I find myself needing to go to the bathroom throughout the day. I’m a teacher, so it’s hard to get to the bathroom when I am in the middle of a lesson. It’s gotten so bad that I started taking Imodium on Wednesday nights, but even that is not working. 
Has anyone had an experience like this? Where you don’t get to expel in the morning and then you find that the pills don’t work? If so, have you found any remedies? This is an awful way to live!
Thank you for any advice.

"I'm a 31 year old male. For almost three years now, I have been experiencing a mysterious right side pain, directly under my ribs.  I have been to the doctor countless time and had what feels like every test under the sun. Multiple abdominal ultrasounds, chest CT scan and xrays, abdominal CT scan with contrast, Echocardiogram, EKGs, Endoscopy, and spinal MRI. All bloodwork comes back normal, except for  slightly elevated bilirubin (had this all my life). Lately I have what feels like a CONSTANT rumbling/gurgling in that area.
I am at my whit’s end- nobody can seem to explain what it is. I am told it’s anxiety or IBS, but it’s impossible to believe that either of those can possibly cause this level of misery. Anxiety has caused other symptoms in my past but nothing like this.  Has anyone dealt with anything like this?

"So this is my story,
During the summers of 2014 I started getting constipated and it was severe I thought I will die of it. However, after using few home remedies I got control over it and started to accept the fact that this is how my stomach is going to behave. I will have bouts of constipation then some days I will have diarrhea, not profuse though. Constipation with incomplete evacuation was my main trouble. I would go to loose multiple times to make sure everything last bit of faeces is out of my system. Then after a year or so I started Losing weight. Through out he year I had a loss of appetite but it didn't effect me much. Sometime s I would eat fine, sometimes I would be in stress and I won't be able to eat. However, it was after one year I started getting weaker and started feeling that I am losing weight. My bowel habits remain problematic but I was not doing much about it. Now after 4 years I have started feeling really weak. My leags and arms have gone so thin and I practically shake. I get tired and exhausted so easily. I am unable to concentrate on studies and I feel like sleeping all the time but when I lay down I just can't sleep. Few more things relevant to the topic are bloating, increased as hell flatulance, nausea, getting tired after eating and sometime s getting cramps which are relieved once I pass motion. I have anxiety issues as well. When I get stressed out or anxious I feel a lump in my throat. I can go a day without eating and it has been this way for years now. I can't control my anxiety at all. I am 24 years old and I am so weak compared to my friends.. I feel like a old age man. Everything I eat feels like going down the drain. My anxiety or whatever the cause maybe doesn't let my abdomen rest at all. I am losing it now. I have lost friends and I am lacking behind in my studies. I am just so confused.
I can feel bones in my body and my veins are so prominent. My eyes have sunken and I just don't feel active anymore.

"Hi everyone
I’ve had a long term unknown condition with my bowel from the start of 2017 and I have had a blood test and a stool test and both came back fine. I used to get bits of blood in my stools but has stopped for months now. But today I saw a clay coloured stool it was half clay and half normal brown and I’ve had this before and I never saw it again until now and it has really worried me, I always have mucus on the sides of my stools all the time which the doctors know about. And I’ve been told it could be my diet and in the past I’ve changed my diet to fruit and other healthy things like no coke and it got better, but now I’m back to it again and I guess it’s gone back to where I am now. I’m only young and I just need some information of what could be causing it, please respond!

"I am 19, an international student, study in United State and I was diagnosed IBS-C in October 2017, and have tried FODMAP for two weeks, didn’t do s*** at all, and didn’t care about the disease since then.
My symptoms are quiet different than the other types of IBS, my stomach always  inflate, I can’t feel any hunger, I feels like there are always a “cloud” of gas stuck in my stomach and don’t go anywhere, my stomach doesn’t hurt, I don’t have any diarrhea, I poop well as long as I consume enough fiber(eat veggie, have brown rice, etc). lt just bothers me and a bit annoying. The good part is, you do eat less. 
When I eat certain food, my stomach will inflate to the point where you feels like you have a ballon, instead of organ, but the symptoms will go away in 3-4 hours. 
After researched for days, I found this forum and read marurice’s post, and I want to give it a try. But the point is, the pill medicine in US is super expensive and I am just a student with no insurance, have anyone tried any generic pill of this medicine, if you do, how do you get them?

"Does anyone have to do this? 
I feel as though I need to do this quite often, but I don't always.
I have loose stool that come out no problem (probably a 5 or 6 on the Bristol Stool Chart) but towards the end of passing the stool, it just stops.
I'll then have to go again to eliminate the rest of it anywhere between 10 minutes - 1 hour after. I don't need more fibre - in fact, Drs have told me to have less fibre to try and firm up my stools. 
 I'm currently doing pelvic floor exercises to see if that helps. 
Just wondered if anyone else has to do this from time to time and what you know about it?

I'm still struggling to work out what I am eating. I've had a really bad flare up just a few days ago and I struggle to eat with the nausea so severe. I hate how much it affects my life.
I've kept food diaries and think tomatoes are an issue but think something else is causing it too. I think I can eat tomatoes based things in small portions and very spread out.
Can anyone recommend any help I could get to try get to solve this? Or any websites that could give me ideas of usual foods that are issues?
Also any gut/bowel cleansing products that may help clean out any bad bacteria please?

Being the anxious person I am I started to google Colon Cancer and to my surprise I was experiencing a few of the symptoms listed. Later in the day I started to experience constipation, the feeling of needing to let go of gas but can't, and so on. I don't know if this is largely due to my anxiety or if I actually have an issue. It should be noted that my uncle suffers from Chron's and my dad has IBS. One more thing, I have had hemmorhoids for quite some time now and my mom said that could be an issue, but I would really appreciate some feedback to help take the stress that I have been dealing with off of me.

"Okay so the title sounds a bit weird, but hopefully you’ll find there’s a method to my madness!
So I’ve had IBS for about 6 years now. It’s a mix of IBS c and IBS d. The main issue is the diarreah (due to food insensitivites) which doesn’t happen too often luckily.I suffer with anxiety because of it - worrying about needing the toilet etc etc. 
Another issue, which might actually be worse than that, is that I’ll go to the toilet and then a minute later need it again and again and again. Not diarrhoea or anything, just constant. 
At first I thought this was technically d, because I’m having to go a lot. But in a way it could be constipation cos when I do go, im obviously not releasing it all.
Now, so far the only thing that has had any help for me was Imodium plus (it’s Imodium but with simethicone which calms the stomach - Normal Imodium gives me stomach aches). However I find it works for the day I’m using it, but the next day I have bad constipation.
So what I was thinking was, should I actually be trying to completely clear my bowel in the morning instead of trying to prevent it with Imodium? For example I often find that, when I have actual diarrhoea, I feel much better afterwards and to be honest if laxatives were to mean that I had a terrible time first thing in the morning but felt good the rest of the day then I’d definitely go for it.
What are your thoughts? If you think I should try, what products would you recommend? I’ve tried Prunes as natural thing, but they make me feel worse (bloating and gas).

"Hi,
Can anyone tell me whether it is highly unusual to have a constant flare up of three months or more.
My symptoms seem to be getting worse. I have intermittent severe back pain and intense pelvic cramping pain on a daily basis. I pass hard pellet like stools and also mucus. There hasn’t been any blood. Some days it feels like I have an urgent need to go but I can’t.
I am due for a colonoscopy in a month although my GP is certain it’s IBS.
I have been quite stressed before the flare up and to be honest the flare up itself is really concerning me.
My life is being ruined with these symptoms. I would be grateful if anyone who has experienced something similar shares their story. I’m starting to worry it’s more than IBS as the usual remedies (Buscopan, colefac etc) don’t work at all.

"Hi I'm Laura. 
Let me start by saying that I am losing my mind and very scared.  I seem to think the worst and act the worst when things start to arise.  All i keep telling myself is I have cancer and that i am never going to see 40 years old.  I am 39. 
Back in the summer of 2016, I had a back surgery for my L5-S1 with a Microdiscectomy and it seems all my problems started from there.  I went an entire year with lower back and numerous MRI's to check to see if they were OK.  Every-time I had a scan the doctors told me I was fine, but it never really got better until recently that the nerves in my lower back have settled down. 
  However, about this time last year, i was tested for Low-Vitamin D and it came back that I was significantly low in the D.  I thought Red haired people made their own D.  I was also taking Protonix at the time for my GERD.  Well it turns out that the 50,000 units I was taking in D would make me jump out of my bed.  I couldn't sleep, every time i would doze off, My brain would fire off again.  So you are probably wondering why I am posting about Bowel problems but talking about Nerve problems.  I'll get to that.  I took the protonix for about two months and then stopped because I thought it was raising my blood pressure.  At the same time I was still shaking at night time, so i stopped taking the Vitamin D and it sort of subsided.  Doctors kept telling me Vitamin D doesn't do that to you.    Fast forward to summer of 2017, I was low again in Vitamin D and I took the 50,000 Doses and it happened again.  Stopped that immediately.  Mind you I also had problems with swallowing and got put back onto protonix for the Gerd, thinking that this was silent Reflux. I also went to an ENT and he said that after a swallow test I was fine.  I stopped taking the protonix and vitamins again and the throat lump went away.  However, I ended up having severe headaches for two months after stopping the protonix.  I was also on the wrong dosage.  I was supposed to be on 40mg. a day when it was really 80mg i was taking due to a pharmacy error.  I got an MRI of my brain and they said everything was fine.   I had a cold tried taking Sudafed, made me shake,  tried Paxil for anxiety made me shake.  I'm afraid to take anything now.  Headaches finally stopped too.  .  I'm afraid any drug I take will make me shake.
Now onto the current events of bowel problems, As of a month ago, i started feeling strong pain going through my abdomen into my back after large meals.  Then all of a sudden I started to have Watery yellow poop and constant cramping in my right side.  The cramping moves from the lower end of my appendix up to behind my ribs and sometimes across to the other side and down below at the left side.   This has been going on for a month.  When it started my shaking at night was pretty bad, to the point I was feeling like I was convulsing.  It was hard to relax because I kept thinking I had cancer.  They did an ultrasound of my abdomen and they said all my organs were within normal levels.  However, I ended going to the ER when i felt like I was dizzy and couldn't breath.  I also feel like someone is pushing down into my pelvis and sometimes i cant feel if my bladder is full.  They took my blood- fine  Took an x-ray of lungs- fine- Did a CT scan with dye- Fine.  A little fatty spot on my liver.  Mind you I am also not a healthy weight. However, since all of this has started I have changed my diet.  No diary, No fatty foods, No Carbs- except sweet potatoes, gluten free stuff.  No vitamins either.  Tried some exercise but I am tired now.  My poop is constantly yellow from soft to watery at times.  i drink only water now and nothing else.  The pain is worse at nighttime laying down.  The shaking still happens but not as bad as a few weeks ago.  
I just had a panel of bloodwork done for my liver- waiting for results- had a hyda scan done yesterday of gallbladder function, waiting for those results.  Did a 24 hour Urine test for Cushing's- waiting for results.   Having an endoscopy\colonoscopy on Tuesday.   All of this is driving me crazy, my husband is going crazy, and my 5 and 8 year old need their mommy back.  
I keep thinking that this is in my Large intestines and I have colon cancer and I am going to die.  I am completely scared and I need some sort of support.  My GP thinks I have somotoform disorder and that I'm healthy when I keep having systems.  My face is having Acne and My hair is brittle and drying out.  
I am at a loss and scared.  I don't want to take anxiety drugs because I am afraid they will cause more shaking at night and I cant sleep.  I wake up about every two hours at night and I know it is not completely restful.  i just don't know what to do anymore.  Thankfully my GI doc is running this gauntlet of tests to help me out

"About 18 years ago, aged 46, I was  very poorly with IBS general symptoms, diarrhea, pain, weight loss. I ended up passing out and in hospital having checks, but nothing found treatable.
I had already heard that in my area there seemed to be a lot of stomach problems. I noticed that when living away from the area my condition drastically improved.(particularly when abroad ). So what was my easiest and simplest form of action?
I took the decision to stop drinking our tap water which had a tendency to smell of chlorine. I have to tell you that my 'condition' has virtually vanished since then.
Some regard chlorine treatment as an old fashioned method of purifying water that is being replaced in many countries by other means. Most people can take this treatment, and is perfectly ok for them, others can't, may be due to a thin bowel lining, I don't know.
I would say that it is worth a try; I have largely lived on bottled water since (and it makes better tea too!). 
This could be a simple solution for you too for IBS, its worth trying.
Best of luck

"Hi everyone,
I posted on here initially back in January after a prolonged illness - never got to the  bottom of what it was. Symptoms included persistent nausea (but no vomiting), extreme fatigue and subsequent weight loss and feeling low.
I have had plenty of tests, and then as quickly as the illness came on it left. However I have never fully recovered since. I am 21 years old, keep fit and active, eat good food, don't smoke and only drink occasionally and never to excess. The only health issue I have had is IBS. My current symptoms are as follows: every 2-4 weeks, I am hit with severe nausea. I have never vomited with this, but I will never go far from the bathroom in case I need to. I become extremely tired and need to sleep. Bowel movements don't change significantly during these spells. It lasts 2-3 days, then I go back to 'perfect health.' 
I understand my symptoms are not red flag ones. I'm just becoming more and more depressed about it. I'm awaiting to see a gastro specialist but there is a 6 month wait; I've been waiting around 4 months already. In the meantime, my GP has temporarily diagnosed me with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome - even though I'm not vomiting! 
I work 12 hour shifts in an ambulance control room, so my job is not pro-active. I suffer severe abdo pains during my shifts from my IBS and often spend most of my breaks on the toilet, embarrassingly. I have noticed that when I getting a really bad bout of these abdo pains then the nausea tends to follow on a day later. The best way to describe the pain is it's like my lower abdo is actively expanding. It feels like I need a movement yet when I go I am generally constipated for a long time before eventually having loose stools. 
Does anyone have any advice? I would welcome your comments. Has anyone heard of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome, or is anyone experiencing my symptoms? There is nothing fun about being unwell, especially as before 2014 I was NEVER ill. 
Thanks in advance guys! 
Regards,
Dec

"I all, I know how miserable it can be to have IBS.
I thought I would let you know I have cured my IBS twice now.  No doctors, no prescriptions and no over the counter remedies.
But ....it takes time and can be quite expensive.
My method is simply to take two Actimel Pots after my weetabix every morning.  On the two occasions I've done this I have cured my IBS but it will take (in my case) four months.  Yup, that's a long time!
When you think of what IBS is, spasms of your stomach, you need to make it as easy as possible for food to move through your intestines and the way this happens is by making sure you have plenty of good gut bacteria to break down your food before.
I'm really confident in my method, I know I'll always be susceptible to IBS, but life is easily manageable when you have the solution.
I've seen some posts where people suffer anxiety and depression and the fear of going out in case they get caught short needing the toilet.  I totally understand this, I was there for YEARS!  This will go away almost straight away - without being too OTT with the information, the day you wake up and have a regular bowl movement without stress, you'll be out the front door and going all over the place, confidently knowing, feeling good inside that you don't need the toilet.
I am now going to toilet once a day - stomach is completely fine with 3 meals a day, I no longer think ""what time am I going to need the toilet?"" - The answer is always ""Tomorrow"" :-)
Good luck!

"I've been suffering for 2 years now with loose bowel movements and really bad nausea. I use to go to the toilet once every 1 or 2 days and my movements would be formed and now I go everyday and very loose, like sludge almost on bad days. On the days I feel really sick, I can go up to 4 times a day. It normally starts with feeling really sick then I'll need to keep going to the toilet. This can last several days, some times up to a week before I start to feel better.
I have been in hospital twice in the past two years with this and had numerous tests that have failed to show anything. Bowel samples have been tested too. The only thing I've never had done is a colonoscopy. I was also tried on buscopan which made no difference whatsoever.
I have kept food diaries but can't work out what is causing me to feel so sick and my bowels to be this way. I can eat the same thing one week and be fine and the next week not! Is there any easy way to work out which food or foods could be causing this? It's extremely frustrating and I hate feeling so sick all the time!

"Hello Anyone on the forum with IBS C who has done the low fodmap and found that although it improved bloating it make constipation worse.  I have been trying to do the elimination stage albeit not strictly and have found whilst it helped with bloating somewhat my constipation has come back.  I down loaded the app and joined a lowfodmap group for advice and it was suggested I sprinkle groundflaxseed on my porridge.  I have been adding just a teaspoon  plus some blueberries.  Does any one know how much I need to add without causing bloating etc.  Before this my gp pushed a high fibre diet to avoid getting an infection with my diverticulosis diagnosed 1 year ago after colonoscopy.  Luckily is just that at the moment no flares.  I have read how much some suffer with this horrible condition and I feel for them.  Going back to the high fibre I started having Branflakes for breakfast( having eaten them for years with no trouble) and adding beans to stews etc.  This was great for constipation even though the stools were very bulky but caused awful bloating.  The bvloating was the reason my gp suggested low fodmap.  I am beginning to think this diet is not for me or at least needs adapting.  I have been taking fybogel.mebeverine for 1 year and even increasing it to 2 doses has not helped.  I am fed up with each wondering have I drunk enough water eaten enough fibre should I have eaten this or that.  No way to live I have enough other problems without having food on my mind all the time.  It seems I can't win high fibre bloating or low fodmap constipation.  Any ideas.  I should add I suffer from anxiety and wonder if this is at the heart of it but so difficult to deal with (I see a counsellor) when you don't feel well.

"Hi All,
I had rectocele and spincteroplasty surgery 3 days ago. I agreed to have this surgery thinking it was going to a walk in the park and I could go back to work after 5 days. I've had two children, a hysterectomy, neck surgery....but recovering from this is the most uncomfortable painful feeling ever. I am on pain meds but they offer minimal relief for only a few hours at a time. Warm baths do help - I take 3-4 baths a day. I have not had a BM yet. I am taking Miralax and a stool softener. I feel best when lying down on my side but walking hurts immensely! My husband has been taking care of me. Thank goodness because I am too uncomfortable to do anything!! Will this pain ever subside?

"Hello all. I've always had problems with my bowels and I'm regularly getting diarrhoea often, usually it only happens after I've eaten something that doesn't agree with me, like takeaway. About 7 years ago when I was at school, I was dealing with a lot of stress and ended up with upset stomach almost daily, causing me to miss lots of school. Recently, I've been suffering with severe anxiety, which causes IBS-like symptoms almost immediately (diarrhea, bloating, stomach pain) and makes my anxiety so much worse. Over the last few weeks I've had stomach pain and upset tummy almost daily, and the only way to stop it is to take Imodium. So I'm currently in a cycle of Anxiety ? Diarrhoea ? Imodium ? Blocked up for days ? Diarrhoea ? Anxiety ? Imodium. I know anxiety can cause stomach distress anyway, but I'm wondering if I have IBS too that's made worse by the anxiety? I've been to the Doctors about it and I'm waiting on results to make sure I haven't got a stomach bug.

"Really hoping someone can shed some light on my symptoms. Over a month ago now I started getting trapped gas, mainly feeling it in my chest which would cause a lot of gurgling. My stomach for the most part has felt fine. I'm occasionally getting a bit of heat in my throat but I think that's from me trying to push out the gas and causing a mild acid reflux so not another symptom. When I first had it, the gas was mainly stuck so my chest hurt quite a bit, however now it tends to pass a lot easier so the chest pain is less. It pretty much went for just over a week after I started taking probiotics I had in, but I ran out after about a week and it came back. I'm back on them now and waiting to see if they help again. Some days are worse than others, where I'm gurgling pretty much constantly, the entire evening. It tends to stop once I lie down in bed. I have never really been able to burp, it happens at random about 3 times a year,but this past month it's happened a few more times. When I was younger, it was common after I ate to 'gurgle' in my throat for a couple of hours, this never caused issue and just stopped at some point without me even noticing. This is worse than what it was like when I was a kid though.
I'm 28, female and I walk for about an hour a day, sometimes longer. I eat lots of salad and vegetables. I do drink coffee but have switched back to a coffee/chicory mix. I did stop coffee for a bit but found it got worse. I don't smoke and I don't drink alcohol or fizzy drinks. Despite a good diet and exercise, I am a bit over weight. Could this be a case of IBS? I had been suffering anxiety prior to this and was having some palpitations after a time of bad stress but that was months ago now. Any help would be greatly appreciated as my Dr isn't helpful and I tend to try treat myself naturally first.

"I've had bad ibs-d which only just died down in the past year or so with the odd once a fortnight flare up (instead of all day every day). Because it got better I stopped taking Citalopram in December as I felt fine anxiety and ibs wise. But this week I've had a sore stomach with d every day so far.
It could be down to stress as I'm planning my wedding for September. But I'm no more stressed this week than any of the past few weeks. I also take probiotics and thought they played a major part in me feeling better.
Calling for a docs appointment tomorrow anyway as I can't go on feeling like this in work its making me feel down and I feel sick about the possibility of this being my life again.
Has anyone had similar issues and found anything that helped? I also came off Citalopram as thought it was what was killing my sex drive but it's not returned so guessing it's my contraceptive pill causing that. So wondering if I'm best to just give in and go back on Citalopram.

":? My GP thinks that I may have irratable bowel syndrome, but I am not at all sure that this is the cause of my stomach problems I am experiencing.
He prescribed Mebeverine Hydrochloride to see how this worked out.
Within 45 minutes of taking the tablet, I found I was dizzy, disorientated and felt very weak and was driving at the time. This passed after about 5 minutes.
I took my second tablet and again 45 minutes after taking it the side effects were much worse than with the mornings tablet: My face and neck went very hot and the dizziness and disorientation began, I decided to work through it, but pretty soon, I felt the muscles under my ears and into the jaw line, not behave as i was expecting. I felt my jaw begin to lock and it was very very frightening. I swayed when I walked back to the kitchen and my husband, and sat down, as these symtoms continued for at least 15 minutes more, I rang the NHS Direct No. and 2 doctors told me that my symptoms were definately due to the drug taken and that I should never use them again. None of these symptoms are displayed on the contra-indications on the tablet leaflet though.
I thought after this and it suddenly came to me that around 25 years ago, a previous doctor has prescribed this type of IBS relief tablet and these too had the same effect on me and I had to stop taking them after taking 2 of them.
I would be interested to hear of any other patient who had experienced any of the symptoms I did, as I feel I cannot be the only one who has a reaction to this type of drug.
I now take no medication and my GP says to try and manage the situation with Mint Tea! I will give it a go, but dont old out much hope of help.

My symptoms have become impossible and I need to do the fodmap diet but i feel so overwhelmed by it all. I had already restricted my diet because of the gastritis. What I'm really looking for is help from the UK with brands and specific snack ideas and what gluten free food i can buy and from where. It would be of massive help to me. Do you go completely dairy free to start with or buy lactofree products?. I'm a really fussy eater from having allergies as a child and I've already become underweight from the gastritis so really can't afford to lose more weight from just being nervous of eating the wrong thing.

"This is a bit of a long explanation I’m afraid. I suffer from celiac disease, although I very rarely get any symptoms. Around 3 months ago I started to get pressure in my rectum along with a dull ache under my right rib. I just presumed it was my celiac disease so decided to sort my eating out as I wasn’t exactly sticking to the gluten free diet. Since then, the pain under my right rib remains but it often spreads down my right hand side and I often get a bout of burping. I also seem to get stomach cramps every now and again aswell. I’m fairly regular to the toilet (2-3 times a day) no change there. I have had a liver function test aswell as a full blood count and all came back normal. Iv had an ultrasound of my liver, gallbladder and pancreas and they have all come back normal. My doctor seems to think it may be a stomach ulcer, although she has admitted herself that’s shes not overly sure what’s wrong. I’m now 3 months later and still this pain on my right hand side and under my ribs remains. Just wondering if any of this could be IBS related? It’s not a condition I know too much about.

"Hello All
Just in need of some advice from IBS sufferers about what I believe to be an IBS flare up, but would like some thoughts and views about.
I was coming to the end of my breakfast when I noticed some loud churning / gurgling coming from my lower abdomen, this was then followed by some passing of gas. Within a very short space of time I started to get random, severe lower abdominal pains, almost like someone was pushing a blunt object inside of me, and then the sudden urge to go to the toilet came on. As soon as I got to the toilet I started to pass stools which were very watery and quite smelly. The passing of the stools has eased the lower abdominal pains, but I'm now left feeling extremely tired and groggy, with some nausea.
I've had bouts of this in the past but not so violent, and it doesn't happen that frequently, on average about once every couple of months. This whole episode lasted no more than 5 minutes, from hearing the churning to coming off the toilet. I can guarantee that I won't need the toilet again today, when I do get these bouts they seem to be one offs.
I'd be very grateful for any views and thoughts on this, especially from IBS sufferers, to me it sounds like a classic IBS flare up.

"Hey,
I was hoping I could run past some symptoms with you guys to establish whether I might have IBS?
On Saturday 11th of March I woke up with a distinct spasm to the left of my belly button (internal) I couldn’t feel it by touch but it felt as though someone was holding a vibrating toothbrush to my stomach.
It’s worth mentioning the night before I had a McDonald’s - the cheeseburger was stale at one side on the top which I thought was strange. 
Ever since then I’ve been experiencing the following:
Loud audible gurgling - all the time and I can feel it as well 
Cramping stomach 
Loss of appetite
Nauseous (occasionally) 
I’ve had one instance of diaorhea and two of hard stools but not fairly normal 
Sharp pains around belly
Pain mid way up back on either side (not sure if related)
If been to the doctors twice - once 4 days after it started and again today - the first time they said stomach bug bit today she said maybe gastroenteritis which may have caused transient IBS. 
It’s doing my head in and it’s really uncomfortable. I thought the best thing to do was ask someone who’s been through the same. 
Google is no help - according to them it’s stomach cancer, chrons disease or ulcerative colitis!
Not experiences these symptoms before so any help would be great. 
Thanks

"Hi Everyone, not sure I am in the right place but will post here too. Will try and explain the best I can. Just over 3 weeks ago I had a very bad bout of flu, because of this I didn't eat much, took lots of night nurse (constipation side effect?) and stopped smoking for a while because of my chest.
Couple of weeks ago I had 2 0r 3 days with no bowel movement at all (normally go once a day in the morning) then since last Saturday I have had rabbit pellet poo,mixed with mucus and also mucus coming out on it's own...also gas with mucus going into underwear.
3 days ago I decided to try some Fybogel which the next morning seemed to produce a normal bowel movement with very little mucus..but again this morning I seem to be back to the small amounts of poo and the mucus (horrible)
I have suffered some of these symptoms on and off to mild degree most of my adult life. Can anyone offer any advice...although these symptoms sound like IBS, I do not have any pain. I am thinking at the moment that I may be very backed up from a change in normal routine, but if so, why all the mucus? Also, is there a time frame for seeing if things improve before I see a Dr? No blood BTW.

"Hi,
First post so go easy!
I have had a sensitive enough stomach with a few years. I knew certain foods would cause me trouble, but even when I risked things, it was generally ok ish. Recently over the last few months things have gotten much much worse. I went through stages of daily diarrhea etc and for the first time every, dropped alot of weight (11 stone down to 9 stone). Food that I always relied on to have an ok stomach suddenly stopped agreeing with me, and food that was dodgy before, was so much worse now. I have went to doc and got blood tests etc done and he thinks it is IBS as I am not celiac . I am now a bit better (reasonably well formed stools accompanied by loose mushy stools).
The puzzling thing is I do not get much cramps/bloating/gas and genuinely feel fine until the next day. For example I could have dinner at 4 o clock and it may be something that does not agree with me.. this reaction will not be felt until the next morning when i am awake??(these stools may start well formed but at the end become mush and loose).. I can eat anything without a sudden or soon reaction - it is the next day when there are issues!! Is this similar to anyone else???
I am very curious as I know a lot of people who get immediate trouble with cramps/bloating/diarrhea. This is not the case with me...?
Thanks in advance!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Hello all,
I've been experiencing ""sudden exhaustion"" symptoms for a few days now.
What happens is I'm usually out, busy, doing something, and suddenly I start to feel tired, lethargic, sleepy, and nauseous and as minutes pass, it gets worse and it suddenly hits me. I'm wiped out, I can barely move my body because of weakness in my bones, I feel nauseous, and I just need to sleep. (The 2nd time this happened, I knocked out in the bus because it happened while I was going somewhere and I woke up 20 minutes later feeling very out of it but okay enough to move and walk around to look for a place to eat).
At work when this happens (I'm currently an English teacher in Korea), since I can't randomly take a nap, my body seems to throb/pulse/shake as if I'm feeling the ground shake a little and my brain feels like it's zoning out. I don't think it's brain fog, I just can't concentrate.
And I'm not sure if it's related, but I currently have hemorrhoids (a lot of bleeding).
I'm genuinely unsure why this sudden exhaustion happens so I'm just trying to post in every forum that is related to everything else I suffer from to see if it could be related to something (anxiety, acid reflux, and ibs). 
I've also gone to my GP yesterday (who did a urine test and said everything came out fine) and he said I might just be very exhausted.
I am also not pregnant.
I have also just started taking yoga 2x a week for 2 weeks now and this sudden exhaustion has never happened to me before this past weekend.
I am looking for a reason this is happening and how I can stop it because it is GREATLY ruining my quality of life.

"Hi all, hello to everyone, I've been reading the forum for a number of months now, but this is my first post.
I began to develop abdominal pain following a course of antibiotics presecribed for an overactive gland back in October last year. Since then my condition has worsened to the point where I exprience lower abdominal pain on a daily basis. Often the pain can be present all day and I can find no way to relieve it. The only other symptom I have is occasinal bloating, but no consitpation or diarrhoea (always been regular and that hasn't changed). My health in general is very good and I exercise regularly (swimming and running).
At first I was prescribed Mebeverine but I found it had very little effect. I have had numerous blood tests, a urine test, and also an ultrasound, all of which were clear.
Around 8 weeks ago I was referred to a specialist gastroenterologist and my appointment is in 3 weeks from now. 2 weeks ago I visited my GP again because I was experiencing an unusually degree of pain. She said she would expidite my appointment with the specialist, however this is something she has been unable to fulfil, in part due to bad communication between them and the gastroenterology department and also due to the fact the specialist only works two days a week.
At this point I haven't been diagnosed as having anything specific, and If I'm honest I kind of feel like I've been hung out to dry by my GP whose answer on most occasions has been to wait and see, which suggests they aren't taking it very seriously.
My question really is, is it possible to suffer from IBS but only experience abdominal pain and bloating?

"Ok sorry for the long explanation but want to make sure I cover everything.
I was diagnosed with ibs 6 years ago due to cramps and needing to go to the toilet etc. After my son was born 3 1/2 year ago I had abdominal pain which turned out to be gastritis and I'm still taking 30mg lansoprasole daily for this.
Back to ibs question, I've had what I thought was 3 flare ups of ibs since just before xmas. Shooting pain up anus which seems to spread to lower abdomen with severe pain but unable to pass stool or wind. (Previous flare ups were diarrhoea which eased cramps after). 
Once the pain has subsided I'm left feeling bruised and unable to go from standing to sitting without wincing and unable to wear trousers that put any pressure on my abdomen this will last 3-4 days. Does anyone else have symptoms similar to this? 
Also I've been having lower back pain not sure if that's related to this or whether that's due to my job which can't be quite physical. 
Any replies/reassurance would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance

"Hi people, can you help.  My doctor is threatening to put me on antidepressants for the sake of my mental health being poor at the moment.  As I have not long had a diagnosis for diverticulosis I need to know what effect a drug like amitriptyline will have on my bowel please?  I am unsure, all the doctors do is bugger the consequences, it seems, to give their anti depressants out like sweets.  Don't they mess up your whole system?  I know both ibs and diverticulosis are not diseases/illnesses of the mind but I don't want to make my physical health worse.  I am not ruling out medication completely but would be willing to try something natural like Evening Primrose which does the same sort of thing.  I am scared of taking anything new incase it makes my health worse.  Any advice, not vile nasty comments gratefully received.

"I have been having pain lower RHS of abdo for the last 4 years.  4 years ago i had lower abdo ultrasound, CT scan and colonoscopy nothing was found so IBS was diagnosed.  the pain had always been like a tightness upon movement rather than cramping etc.  Ever since I have had random nighttime bouts of Diarrhoea and severe cramps then once that has passed waking in the morning just the usual ache.  Usually once in a couple of weeks.
in Dec I was referred to A&E by GP for severe upper RHS abdo pain, unable to sleep through and was constant. suspected gallstones/pancreatitis.  Bloods ruled out pancreatitis but was sent away for a follow up upper abdo ultrasound for 4 weeks later.  All this scan showed was a cyst on my liver but no issue with gallbladder. 
Ever since then the pain has changed from the severe acute pain in upper abdo to a pain similar to a constant stitch which seems to wrap around to my side and back.  This discomfort never goes away, just can get worse.  
I am also now randomly sick in the night too, no more diarrhoea or cramps just vomit then back to sleep and back to normal the next morning.  This happens at least once a week but I havent yet been able to link it to any particular foods or food groups only that any alcohol whatsoever appears to guarantee it.  I have obviously given up any alcohol but i was only ever an occasional drinker anyway.
I am aware that everybodies symptoms for IBS flare up differently but has anybody ever experienced anything similar or any idea what it might be?
I had my appendix removed 20 years ago so its not that.  I am waiting for my apt for gastroscopy.
thanks in advance.

"Well I finally got the courage today to call and make an appointment with a gastro. Going next Tuesday for a consult.
There is colon cancer in my family so I get super anxious about it. In fact, I get anxious about anything health related really... and stress is a trigger in general for IBS like symptoms so that doesn't help anything.
Recently though I have noticed an increase in gas in my belly, and some of it smells so bad, especially at night (poor hubby) and I can't seem to link it to food. I've eliminated gluten, dairy... avoid certain veggies and still no clue.
I am really healthy-- doing my first Ironman this year. Rarely get sick. But I've always had what I call a ""nervous"" stomach... would be pooping a lot before exams or events as a kid and teen.
These days I seem to always have a normal BM in the morning first thing or shortly thereafter. Then some days I'll go up to 4 more times, but it will be smaller and harder than the first of the day. I have frequent moving gas like pains and frequent ""urge"" to go. Sometimes mucous in stool. Gassy like I said.
I had one bout of red blood in stool 12 years ago, which was my first visit to gastro and they did a colonoscopy which came back completely normal and they said it was likely a hemorroid that had already healed. Sent me on my way without even a followup, lol.
Anyway wondering if you guys think this just sounds like typical IBS symptoms. It does to me, and I'm hoping that is just it, but made an appt anyway. If nothing else to ease my mind.
Also, I do take Zoloft (antidepressant) for anxiety, priobiotics, digestive enzymes daily and recently picked up IBGuard (peppermint oil).

"I've been struggling the past 6 months with diarrhea, weight loss, floating stools, and stomach pain (always lower left side) and really wondering with what this could be.  It all started back in July after some days of stomach pain followed by a really bad episode of diarrhea that woke me up in the middle of the night and lasted a few days.  Since then, I’ve had reoccurring stomach pain and diarrhea usually every 3-4 days.  When I’m not having full blown diarrhea I usually have weird floating stools that are a mix of normal looking or soft and not complete.
I can normally tell when I wake up if I’m going to have stomach problems or not as I have really bad gurgle noises and popping gas on the left lower side.   This is normally followed by a soft or floaty BM and then I have 3-4 rounds of diarrhea.  I’ve lost about 20 pounds in the past 6 months, mainly from either being in pain or not knowing what to eat.  I’ve tried a food diary, cut out gluten and dairy, tried taking probiotics, but nothing seems to work.
I’ve also had a colonoscopy which was normal, blood tests and celiac test, and an ultrasound which was fine.  The next steps they want me to do is either a HIDA or CT scan of the abdomen but it’s all getting really expensive.
Should I accept this as IBS or does anyone have ideas of what I should do?

"Hi there, I'm a mid-40's female, with a 20 year history of IBS at varying levels.
I'm under Gastro at my local hospital - they suspect I have slow gut transit (nothing sinister), so I'm going to be having a couple of tests.
This week, Monday I've had to do liquid laxative clean out ""Klean-Prep"" (yes it's every bit as disgusting as it sounds and nothing clean about it) and worse than any over the counter lax you can buy.
Out of the 4 Sachets (which make up 4 litres) I've only taken half. I had to stop when it made me sick, left my anus red raw and bloody.
I am still having clear out, I'm so so bloated and my belly is in so much pain - cramps and spasms.
I'm not 'deflating' - I've been massaging my stomach but it's not moving things along.
Can anyone help or advise me, please, I'm at my wit's end.
Thank you. X

"I'm Kevin. I'm coming up to 64 and a few months back had a really bloated stomach and change in my bowel movements, diarrhoea alternating with mild constipation and often a sudden need to go ""now"", often very soon after eating a meal.
My GP had a prod around and listened to my stomach but, apart from confirming there was a lot of gas, didn't really seem too concerned.
As nothing much changed I went back after a few weeks and she arranged a blood test and ultrasound scan. When the results came through she said nothing really showed up so suggested avoiding things like cabbage which can cause bloating but nothing more and told me it was probably just IBS.
I have always been a worrier and in addition my role as a fulltime carer for my wife for the past 20+years hasn't been easy. I had of course done some reading up on my symptoms etc.. and given my age was obviously worried that it was something worse so GP eventually agreed to refer me but only as a routine case so I won't get an appointment until mid summer. To be fair I haven't noticed any blood or weight loss (and my worrying about things will be causing that anyway!) but my actual bowel symptoms are still erratic to put it mildly.
Would appreciate any thoughts and thanks for taking time to read this.

"Hi,
I’m new here and have a few questions. I’ve just been prescribed Mebeverine and need to take 3 tablets a day. 
I have taken one and noticed I have been to the toilet a few times since 11 this morning. 
I’ve been having bowel problems and ive had to do a stool sample and the dr noticed I had a lump in my stomach that moved and it had a pulse it was on the left side and very large. He said it might be blockage do you get this with IBS? 
I have to take these tablets for two weeks to see if it helps me as I get constipated a lot and feel as though I’ve done a good stool and it tends to be tiny.
Just worrying as google is making out I have the big C. I do suffer with swollen lymph nodes and my bloods came back normal range so I’m a little confused if IBS can cause swollen moveable lymph nodes

The gas seems to get trapped and won't come out. I've been to different doctors and have had sigmoidoscopies, colonoscopies, scans, etc. The doctor gave me hyoscyamine, but it does nothing for the pain. I've tried heating pads, GasX, Tylenol, Motrin, Mylanta. Nothing helps. I'm desperate. I am going into my 19th hour of pain. Does anyone have any suggestions?

"I've been having some symptoms. a feeling of something being in the rectum, also nausea. what's interesting is that when I suddenly pass gas, the symptoms go away. my rectal area builds back up with gas again quickly, but this whole time I thought it was a lump, seems to not be. also I had a rectal exam the other day and he saw nothing, so... idk
if passing gas relieves my symptoms, its probably not cancer, right? when I pass gas the nausea goes away too. thanks

"Hi. I am currently an 19 year old college student. For the past month or two, I have been dealing with on and off constipation, but I never really thought much of it because I was still having BM and the stool appeared normal. The past 2 weeks has been different. I can only seem to have a BM after exercising and drinking lots of water. The stool seems to be soft, and disintegrates upon flushing. On days where I don't exercise, I don't have a BM or its very small, thin stools. This had caused me to worry, and I'm wondering if that has something to do with the reduced amount of BM. I also have been eating lots of fiber and avoiding foods that often cause constipation, but it is not seeming to help. Does this sound like normal symptoms of IBS?

"Hello again,
My GP diagnosed me as probable IBS around 8 months ago following scans, bloods and CT with contrast.  Have had episodes of the urgency, LS, sometimes constipation, sometimes just quantity etc etc.  But never really any pain.  Was never given any medication but in fairness other than the urgency it hasn't caused me so much of a problem.
I am Female aged 55yrs.  Had menopause around 8 years ago.  Previously had endometriosis.  
Last night I developed a really low abdominal grumble - like a cramp that went literally across the very lowest part of my abdomen.  Overnight it settled like a pin point pain in my left very lower abdomen.   Reminded me of period pains.  Makes me feel nauseous, can't get any relief with paracetamol etc.  I am windy, but stools OK, been only about 4 times today.  But I do feel a bit dizzy / strange.
Is this likely to be part of my IBS or is it possibly something else?  I don't want to mither my GP if it is IBS related.  But I don't want to ignore it if it doesn't sound like that is the cause.
Do I need to get some medication?   Sorry for the ramble x

"Hey. In the past 3 months I've been having issues with my stomach and bowel movements. I have also felt nauseous a lot and its really annoying. I have been to the doctor and had a stool sample done, but its been 3 weeks now and I haven't heard anything. 
I have also had cold symptoms on and off with coughs and fevers and a stuffed nose, sometimes coughing up mucus. I feel like I've gotten better but it won't completely go. Then it will come back and I'll wonder if I ever got better from the last time because I've never felt completely well again. My stomach is starting to cramp a lot lately and feel incredibly bloated, I could have constipation and then the next minute have diarrhea, and I'm just wondering what is going on. I can't think of anything that could of made IBS so much worse, but now its really starting to affect my day to day life. I have also had bloody stools but that has stopped happening now. Any ideas what this could be? I just feel generally unwell with this. Thanks

"Hi,
I'm still struggling with stomach/bowel problems for a few years. It all started with h pylori bug about 3 years ago but my stomach/bowels have not been the same since. I have been tested for everything that I can see with cameras up and down.
So I still get pains in my stomach and down the sides, sometimes too tender to touch and the pain sometimes is in my bladder region, oddly the pain is never in all of these places at once.
The only times I have relief was a) taking omeprazole and more recently Cimeditine which stopped the pain for a short while and b) glugging tesco heartburn and indigestion liquid with every meal.
My question is can the omeprazole and cimeditine give only temporary relief? My dr said this is impossible as they either work or they don't work so I'm perplexed.
Thanks in advance

"I’ve been on the low carb Keto diet for about a month and most of my issues have disappeared. I’ve been IBS-C for over 8 years. I’m lactose intolerant and allergic to raw garlic and onions. However, now that I’ve cut out carbs I’ve had NO bloating. I think it’s worth a try for anyone with IBS. It’s an easy diet for me because I can eat what I love and giving up sweets and bread, etc. is not difficult.

"Hi there. I'm getting an ultrasound tomorrow to rule out gallbladder problems and I was wondering if your doctor sent you for one right after you described your symptoms to them?
Some background: I've had GI issues my whole life, I have high anxiety so I always associated it with a nervous stomach. I get bloated, gassy, and sometimes get what I call 'poop attacks' that have me running for the bathroom. I reluctantly went to my doctor because along with these symptoms I've always had, I've started to have some pain in my upper stomach area that when it comes on makes me so distended, it hurts quite a bit. It almost feels like acid churning/burning. Weirdly, eating a bit seems to help settle the pain, which I read can be a symptom of ulcers/functional dyspepsia.
Three years ago after a long day at an outdoor festival with a lot of alcohol and not enough water and food I woke up with terrible pain in my right upper abdomen and went to the ER. They gave me an ultrasound that came back normal. I was told I could have an ulcer and was given omeprazole, but I've stopped taking that as I found I didn't need it as much and is expensive.
My doc told me if tomorrow's ultrasound came back clear we would look more into an actual IBS diagnosis.
Has anyone had symptoms similar to mine, got a referral for an ultrasound, and had it come back ok? I know gallbladder issues can still exist even if an ultrasound can't pick them up...I guess I'm just crossing my fingers for IBS instead of gallstones at this point. It's frustrating because so many of the symptoms overlap. Any insight would be appreciated.

"Hi there! My husband was diagnosed with IBS-D several years ago. We have been working to find triggers and eliminate them from his diet, but he still has major flare-ups on occasion. The problem is, he is overweight, and it is wreaking havoc on other areas of his health (he also has severe depression, sleep apnea, and insulin resistance). I cook most of our meals from scratch (I have celiac disease), so I am confident I can cook for just about any kind of diet. However, I have no idea what to feed him to help with his weight loss since he cannot tolerate foods such as oatmeal, salad, many veggies, and whole grains at all.

"Tried alverine citrate for a while, was concerned that it may be having side effects so I tried mebeverine, which was an awful drug for me.
It was like I was not even on medication. I was wondering whether other people have been through similar experiences and what type of IBS it is for really.
Some studies show that it is no more effective than a placebo.

"Anyone else have IBS symptoms that..
I have a very normal BM almost every morning like clockwork.
Then as the day goes on, I get super gassy and bloated. I usually have a couple more BMs during the day which are small and hard. 
My time of the month I go more and it’s closer to IBS-D, which I know can be normal. 
I eat well, exercise daily and avoid mytrigger foods that I know. The gassy everyday thing is super annoying though.

"I have been suffering from stomach problems for some time now. Everything I eat seems to effect me. The pain keeps me up nightly.
It feels like a ball of pain inbetween ribs stomach area, then sweeps through my body. I bloat so much it's unbearable. I get really restless where all I want to do is pace to room to try ease it. This never does! I was given omroprezole by the Dr for a month but this didn't help. I've had blood and sample done to see if it was an infection but these came back clear I've had more bloods and x-ray the only thing that came up was vitamin D deficiency.
The doc initially said it could be an ulcer but now changed to say it could be ""Just IBS"" I am slightly annoyed at this because this doesn't change the fact that I'm in agony every time I eat anything more that a mouse's portion. He has given me tablets for IBS mebrevine but these don't help at all. I really am at a loss now. Currently lying in bed in agony wondering what the heck is going on.
Symptoms:
Pain in upper abdomen like a ball of pain
Bloating
Restless whole body hurts
Rock hard stomach
No reflux or heartburn feeling.
No such foods cause it but if I eat too much it's awful.
Can anyone relate this to being IBS? And if so how you manage it?
Sorry for the long post just at wits end now.

"Hi All,
I am suffering from IBS for about a couple of years now. Recently this is getting worse and making my life complicating. Sometimes I have IBS attacks so suddendly and unexpectly that I have to leave work because I can't stay in the office any longer. The only thing that makes me feel better is laying down. When the pain arrives I can't sit or stand up either. Sometimes I feel like I am going to faint.
Just been to the GP and what he did (WITH NO SURPRISE) was just prescibe me some antispasmotidcs called Mebeverine and even if I tried to insist I want to go and see a specialist he did not do anything. He just said it's not worth it!! SO what shall I do? take tablets for all the rest of my life? Make up a diet on my own? Leave work, friends every time I have one of this painful attack that take my breath away?
I am really really upset and hopeless. :cry:
I can't handle this anymore. I am always bloated, look like I am pregnant :oops: and feel tired with no energy. When I got one of this attack I just want to go to bed and the pain usually alleviates a bit. But this is affecting my social life and if I think I am only 26 and this can last a life time, how can i cope with it?
If anyone of you there reading this message has found a most effective solution to tablets and diet I would be happy to know.
I heard acupuncture may help? Anyone experiencing that?
I would not be afraid of anything and ready to do a colonscopy right now if this could help but as my \""dear\"" GP said is not worth it. SO question is: WHAT DOES IT REALLY WORK AGAINST IBS? what is worth doing?
Thank you so much for reading my message and I am closed to everyone who like me is suffering from IBS.

I’ve suffered with IBS for years, diet, stress, anxiety any sort of change in plan/life style I get an insanely bad stomach. Can last for days on end. To top it off I also have a real anxiety about using bathrooms. I have about 3 toilets I can use comfortably without freaking out.  If I’m going anywhere where one of those toilets is out of reach, I take Imodium, I know it’s bad and it leaves me feeling crap for days buts it’s the only thing I know will stop me needing the toilet!

before a bowel movement i will just start to feel so sick.  Stomach burning, and just a over all sick feeling. My stool will go from normal to horrible diarrhea.
From the moment i open my eyes in the morning, I have horrible gas and also through out the day.  
After I eat, i can just hear and feel my stomach and insides making all sorts of noises and of course comes more gas. 
I've been to my regular doctor several times and have had multiple blood test, urine test, ect and of course everything comes back normal. 
I have now been recommended to see a Gastroenterologist on Thursday. 
Does this sound like IBS?

I’ve tried quitting caffeine. I quit smoking weed just to see what effect it would have. I tried the low FODMAP diet and other dietary changes. I’m on an SSRI for anxiety.
I have spent so much time and money on this condition and what have I got to show for it? Nothing. Alcohol dependency was the biggest of obstacles to overcome but dammit I did it, and it achieved nothing. My IBS is still just as bad.
I have no idea why it’s so bad. I can’t sleep properly. I get woken up everyday by gas, discomfort and the urge to go. My bowel movements are small, broken, flat stools and I have incomplete evacuation every time. Nothing bulks them up properly. Discomfort and urge to go after every meal.
I’m nearly at my wits end. I’m going to be addressing my sleep problems with melatonin soon in the hope that helps but if it’s doesn’t help then I’m clueless.
Has anyone else found that there is nothing that helps them? I’m beginning to feel quite alone, and fear I’m doomed to live with this debilitating condition for the rest of my life. Ha, if you can even call this a life...

But after the 3rd trip to the loo my anxiety creeps in the stomach noises/rumbles happen I have horrid cold shivery feelings all over, I have to go again!

"Around this time last year I was concerned that I had a pancreatic problem.  Had the most dreadful almost water loose bowels around 7-8 times a day, with literally a couple of minutes warning, and particularly after eating, often explosive, greasy, floating etc.  Lots of other symptoms too, lost over a stone, dry mouth, intense deep seated pain in the middle of my left ribs, nausea, unable to stand ......anyway, GP did bloods, USS and eventually CT with contrast thorax to pelvis.  Pancreas was OK and he diagnosed IBS.  
I had developed this during a period of acute personal stress, but continued to work.  I had had strange bowel patterns for some considerable time - probably years - alternating Constipation and loose stools, occasionally this sudden need to go within 60 seconds of getting a deep grumble in my belly (which reminded me of period aches) but none of the other symptoms.
Around 3 months from first seeing GP, and 4.5mths from first onset of symptoms.  Things settled, I regained weight and life went on.  
My Mother became very unwell at the end of November, and I spent all my time driving back and to to be with her, until she died in January.  You go totally into overdrive.
But this last 2 weeks I have had increasing heartburn (which I put down to too much wine over the couple of weeks following Mum's death but which I stopped drinking when the heartburn started), a feeling of like a pointed hand being stuck in my belly half way between my breasts and my belly button, not a really severe pain but a discomfort, but it is intermittent.  The same ache in my left ribs and back.  And then alternating between being really constipated to having profuse diarrhoea, very often at very short notice, and returning a couple of times within the hour.
Last night I was woken at 3am with that dragging period like pain lower belly, and within a couple of minutes had the most profuse diarrhoea, and was back to the loo 4 more times before 4am.   Nil since.  However there was quite a lot of fresh blood when wiping.  I have had this occasionally before with both C & D but not as much as last night.
So I am assuming that my GP was correct by putting my ailments down to IBS.  I don't particularly want to go back to him but wondered if anybody could give me advice in how to keep on top of it, minimise it, and also if the bright red blood is something I should be concerned of.  Again this has not appeared since.
Thank you in advance x

"Hi there,
I am absolutely new to this site so please forgive me if I am resurrecting a previous  threads.
i am into the fifth week of Symprove for IBS-C with excellent results. It is my intention to complete the 12vweek programme and then possibly reduce to a maintance dosage-I am retired and can not afford the full dose cost!
At that stage it would be my intention to introduce Organic Sauerkraut that has not been pasteurised at very small doses given the concentration of bacteria.
Has anyone adopted this approach who was taking Symprove and found that no adverse effects or regression of the IBS occurred when a fermnented was added.
I cannot see any reason why the bacterial profile of Sauerkraut would be too dissimilar from Symprove and that there would be competition between them.
Many thanks

"Hi All.
Just a quick question to you fellow IBS sufferers that I'm looking for thoughts and views on, hoping some of you can help.
I suffer with IBS-A (alternating), but during a flare up I sometimes get some rectal bleeding, and at the same time get what can only be described as gurgling / fizzy sensations anywhere in my lower abdomen. The flare ups last about a week, but the bleeding goes on for a few days after then stops. I usually go weeks to months before it happens again. During these bouts of bleeding I tend to feel more generally unwell. The blood is bright red, and usually after passing a stool (red blood on toilet paper, maybe a drop or two in the toilet bowl), but has been known to come out before passing one, and sometimes it can look like there are blood clots on the toilet paper when I wipe, however I do produce a lot of mucus with my IBS and wondering if this is a combination of loose stool, blood and mucus. I'm currently going through one of these bouts now, and experiencing IBS-D at the moment, and there isn't a huge amount of blood, but its there. The last time I had bleeding, I was going through IBS-C, and there was quite a bit of blood. This made me go to the doctor, who prescribed me suppositories for heamorrhoids, and at the end of the course of suppositories the bleeding stopped, this was about 6 - 8 weeks ago, but now I'm bleeding again. My doctor has referred me to a Gastroenterologist as he feels a colonoscopy would be wise. I did have a combined colonoscopy and endoscopy a couple years back and all that was found was that I had a very long and mobile sigmoid colon, and polyps which were removed and found to be benign, no other issues.
Sorry to have to be so graphic about my toilet habits, and I hope some of you can give me your thoughts and views on this, especially if you do suffer the same as I do.
Many thanks in advance.

At one point I fainted while on the toilet and my mum rushed my to hospital and they told me it was due to the amount of pain I was in. I have spoken with my local GP and he suggests I have IBS, but I feel it is something much more severe, I am being referred to the hospital but that can take up to 40 weeks. I have been kicked out of college 3 times due to my absences with my sickness & it is now effecting my job. Other symptoms include; bloating, itchy skin, depression & fatigue.

When I go to the bathroom and release I still feel severe discomfort in my stomach. I’ve been vegan for about a year, and I’ve recently cut gluten out of my diet in hopes it would improve which it did a little bit. However, it’s always unpredictable some days I’ll feel normal (rarely) but I’ll try to poop in the morning and sometimes I do but then I get excessive gas afterwords. In addition, I never feel like I’m done pooping, ever. I always feel like there’s more but It won’t come out. I’ve tried activated charcoal to allievate gas but it’s hasnt helped, and I’ve tried drinking more water and trying apple cider vinegar, still no change. I feel so hoplesss because I don’t want to keep living this, always being in discomfort, excessive amounts of gas and bloating, constipation, and never feeling like I’m done pooping.

It does affect my day to day life because, I am doubled up in pain so I can just about manage work then nothing much else for the rest of the day which isn't me as I like to be on the go.

I usually only go once in the morning but it’s always around a number 5 on the Bristol stool chart, usually small, easily passed, soft, raggy pieces and it’s driving me insane with worry because I have it in my mind that a normal healthy one should be like a smooth sausage (which I almost never do!).
My gp has given me Fybogel but I’m reluctant to take it as it contains aspartame which my stomach does not like.

"Hey all,
I was curious if any of you experience the same symptoms as me and might know what's causing the problem and how to remedy it.
For the last few years I've been having flat (or inconsistent), sometimes pale-brown, stools that are always broken up into many pieces. I don't usually have a lot of difficulty passing the stools except at the end of a BM where it feels like the last little bit won't come out. I've  not had a well-formed ""log"" that left me satisfied in a long time. The incompleteness leaves me with some discomfort and the slight urge that I need to have another BM all throughout the day. Discomfort is most noticeable shortly after eating a meal and is located primarily in my lower abdomen and in my rectum. Accompanying that discomfort is me being more sensitive to touch, like when the wind brushes against the hairs on my body it's super annoying. As well as that I'll jiggle my leg a lot because I'm irritated by the incomplete feeling. On occasion I'll need to go to the toilet just minutes after eating, or even when I'm only half way through my meal! I'll often try to ""stimulate"" a motion while alone in my room  so I can just go to the toilet to get it over with and somewhat relieve the discomfort. I also feel bloated and ""tight"" or full all day, my belly never feels flat anymore and I can sometimes hear/feel trapped gas moving around inside.
I've also noticed that when I have my BM I tend to open and close my anus rather than push in one motion if that makes sense - I think that's because the stools are broken, it doesn't come out in one go. Just lately I've also been experiencing some pain in my abdomen and lower back in the morning which is relieved after a trip to the loo - it seems to only occur if I eat before bed though.
I'm sick of having this problem and spending so much time sitting on the toilet or having to go 3-4 times a day, and being afraid to eat because of the discomfort I'll experience shortly after. I'm going to Europe with my family in 3 months and I can't even be excited for it because I'm worried about my bowel function and toilet access when I get over there. It's ridiculous! I've been to see a specialist and I've had tests done that will find out if I have celiac or inflammation which I'm waiting on the results for. It's stressing me out though - all the waiting and hoping I'll be cured before I go away. I've tried probiotics, fibre supplements and various other things with little or no results. Can anyone help me?

"Hi all,
Maybe someone can relate to an experience I'm having. I'm not quite sure if this is because of IBS or not but I have chronic constipation and for the past 2-3 weeks I have had pain in my lower abdomen (left side) It was bad a few days ago, I went to the ER and they diagnosed me with Gastritis.
That made me stop worrying for a little bit but the pain intensified after I had been constipated for a week and a half. I started taking miralax, stool softeners, eating bran. I finally went to the bathroom but it wasn't bulky, just very small and watery.
I went back to the ER because the pain in my lower abdomen was STABBING, it woke me up in the middle of the night and caused anxiety attacks for me because I was so scared of an infection or something blocking my intestine. 
They took urine, blood, CT scan. They saw that I had an ovarian cyst on my right side, and the ER doctor ruled the stabbing abdominal pain as just IBS. 
Is there any way this could be an infection or something serious and it was overlooked because I have IBS? Let me know if anyone else has experienced this. 
I have an appointment with a gastrologist in 6 days but I can't help but let my mind wander.
The pain gets worse when I try to go to the bathroom (straining to poop)

"So I have no idea if what I'm struggling with is IBS, but I'd like to see what people think. I read that IBS flare ups after the flu are pretty common, but there are also many other things that this could be.
I think this started about 3 weeks ago when I got my wisdom teeth out, and took antibiotics for about 5 days (Amoxicillin.) I had to stop taking them because I felt very ill and nauseous and could not participate in any normal activities. And then this past Tuesday, I became very ill with the flu. I had no energy, had a fever, cold chills, stuffed nose, cough, and a painful headache. Many of these symptoms started to go away by Friday or Saturday, but what replaced it was a severe stomach pain and nausea. Friday morning I woke up extremely uncomfortable, and it is now Monday and this has not gone away. For the first three days, the pain would go away when I was eating, and it almost felt like I was back to normal until I would stop eating again. Now, it's pretty much constant. It feels like a hollow/empty feeling in my stomach, and I do not really feel hungry or full ever. The nausea affects my chest, head, and throat, and I have also felt extremely low and depressed the past couple days. I do not have diarrhea and have not vomited and have not been able to, even days when I felt I needed to. I saw a doctor and he prescribed me anti-nausea medication but it has not done anything, and I have also been trying calcium supplements in case it had to do with Acid Reflux. I'm wondering if this could be something like the H. pylori infection, or if it is IBS. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

"Hello, after many months of tests etc my clinic physician now thinks I am suffering from IBS, slightly atypical in that the main symptom is pain. I was on codeine which helped, but he thinks this was making the pain worse in the long term. He recommended paracetamol for pain relief, but it's not very effective. I've also just started amitryptiline which has knocked me out and today I have the triple whammy of severe pain, severe fatigue and dopiness. I am struggling. Does anyone have experience of an effective form of pain relief I can use to cope--I cannot do hot water bottles and deep breathing in work meetings!

"Hey guys. I made a topic here about a month ago. This was before my stool test came back and I was having some serious concerns.
So I had another blood test along with the stool test and they both came back perfectly fine apart from a slight folic acid deficiency. I was given some meds and told to come back in a month. Meds were ineffective, still had inconsistent stools and pain. Came back and gave me Mebeverine. I've been on it a few days now and my pain has improved significantly along with cramps. So I thought I was in the clear but tonight I had a stool that i'm convinced had blood in it.
How can I have a perfect stool test less then a month ago then have a movement like that? I had orange pepper a few days ago but how could it become red? I dont understand. Can anyone help me out?

The pain is usually around the belly button to the right or it can be upper and lower abdomonal pain always the right hand side. Sometimes get back pain and groin pain towards the right the pain usually last a few seconds. I also suffer with indigestion and gas.

After a year and a half of going to the doctors there Finaly sent me to a specialist who gave me a colonoscopy and a ultrasound which also came back normal.  The doctor told me that if I was still getting the pain he would give me a ct scan which now he is telling me that there is no need and basically told me there nothing wrong with me and if the pain gets worse go to a and e. So now I feel like I’m at a dead end and unsure what to do as the pain doesn’t seem to go away. Has anybody else experience this im worried it could be my appendix.
Thanks

"Hi there, has anyone tried fennel water for very bad gas. I’m really struggling with gas and the foul smells I make! I get cramp with it. I do drink fennel tea and take buscopan and mebeverin but they do not stop the smell! My husband is now asking me to stop passing gas and I just can’t! 
Hope someone has had experience with making fennel water and it being a success to ease wind!

"Hi my name is Robert I am 19 and I have had irritable bulls**t syndrome my whole life. 
You know, the collection of symptoms they label ibs and tell you theres nothing wrong with you? Yeah that one. 
All the way up to 13 I was malnourished,  extreme bouts of diarhea, the whole shibang. Was told nothing was wrong with me, that it's anxiety, all in my head.  
I know my body.  So we requested tests and found out I have celiac disease along with ibs.  I sprouted up but still have issues pooping.  I can't fully evacuate and it comes out fatty/sticky hard to wipe. I go multiple times a day still and am in the bathroom for hours usinf hundreds of wet wipes. 
Doctors still tell me I have celiac, nothing else, its in my head, that idk how to wipe my ass.  
Fast forward i take the breath test for sibo, tested positive.  My dumbass gastro puts my on low fodmap and xifaxan for only a week.  Nothing else.  I felt a little better but after that she gave up so we moved gastros. 
Other diagnosis following that are 
Exocrine pancreas insufficiency
Chronic fatigue 
Depression
Anxiety 
White tongue coating
Recently ive been doing so much research and have demanded my zinc copper and rt3 levels tested. 
Zinc and copper were low and rt3 is high. 
My doctor tells me its a reflection of my gut health and that once i fix it my levels should normalize.  Thanks you f*****g moron. 
Gastro then tells me she has no idea what to do and recommends me to a tertiary. 
 I am now seeing a new doctor and he put me on fibercon and gnc megaman which is helping with my energy so far.  Hes going to look for what is causing my symptoms etc.  not worried about the rt3 and tells me the rest of my thyroid is fine so not to worry. 
My doctors dont listen, my parents dont listen, so im just really scared. 
I went on xifixan again for two weeks along with 101 billion probiotics, 40g glutamine, 2 tbsps of metamucil, and had actually a few normal bowel movements but things regressed once i got off Xifaxan.  Seeing how this fibercon etc goes. 
If anyone has any questions, this is my life and i do hours of research a day so maybe i can help you out.  I also work at a GNC and have supplement knowledge.  
Also if anyone could give me insight on the low copper, zinc, high rt3 i would appreciate it.  I think i have a case of hypothyroidism as well. 
 Godspeed to all of those dealing with this made up bulls**t syndrome.  We will find a way.

"I'm going to see my Dr on Wednesday, just be clear, I'm not one to go Dr's but this has me panicking for some reason. 
So since about 14 (20 now) I've had acid reflux, but I only went to the Dr's for it once at 16, was on Lanzo for about a month, and never went to get re-prescribed or anything. I get it often enough, sometimes it barely bothers me most of the time. I have like a constant lump feeling in my throat, which worsens rarely but it is constantly there, doesn't effect my breathing or anything. 
But just recently (2-3 days) I've been having a sort of dull, pressure, sometimes slightly painful feeling bang in the center of my upper abdomen, right below the breastbone. 
I have't had a number 2 in 24 hours now, but I don't feel any normal constipation pain, I don't feel nausea, and don't feel particularly ""weak"" or anything of the sort, which is why I'm worried. Ontop of that, and sorry for TMI, but last night at work on two seperate occasions I badly felt like I needed a #2, but a see through sort of gel like substance came out, nothing else. I don't have any rectal bleeding, but have had it in the past, but it's from the surface/anus area, not from the actual rectum itself. 
Am I just being overly paranoid? My family has no history with cancer or anything like that, but because I've put myself in a state of fear I constantly worry that I've developed colon canceror something similar. 
Kind of just looking for re-assurance or if anyone who has had the same symptoms could give me a hand. 
Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!

"In the last few years my IBS has gotten worse and so too has my sleep. I now wake up every morning with gas, discomfort and urgency. I have to get out of bed to have a bowel movement and cannot get back to sleep, especially since I have discomfort from incomplete evacuation. My sleep also never feels refreshing.
I suspect my antidepressant (Fluvoxamine) is also causing me sleep problems. I often feel tired, but restless at the same time. It’s difficult for me to even take a nap. I’m seeing my psych soon so I’ll be able to discuss that with him. Is there any medication that has helped any of you with sleep?
I have tried giving up alcohol, and giving up caffeine with no real difference. Weed used to help, but doesn’t anymore.
I kind of question which came first, the worsening of my IBS or the poor sleep. I know lack of sleep can make symptoms worse. I guess it’s kind of become this vicious cycle where they affect each other now. What can I do?

"This, for me, is one of the most annoying symptoms of IBS. 
How long does it take you to do your 'business' and clean up? 
For me, it takes a few minutes to pass a stool, but then 10-15 minutes to 'clean up'. There seems to be (most of the time) extremely small traces of stool every time I wipe. If I stop cleaning up, and wait for a bit, it's almost as if my anus closes up properly and then there is none. 
If, however, I 'dig' a little deeper there seems to be more stool there. 
So, I'm unsure what to do. Try and get rid of all the stool or leave it? I do suffer from the 'morning rush' and sometimes will go twice within an hour. 
I have also had a haemorrhoidectomy middle of last year and not sure if there is any side effects from this?

"Hello
I've had IBS since 1985, yes that's not a misprint, and in 2014 I had a Colonoscopy and was told I had Diverticular Disease.
So now it would appear that I have both at the same time, not sure if IBS has caused Diverticular to occur ? 
In all that time I have had regular bowel movements which I am so thankful for having read many posts over many years and spoken with several who suffer with this over many years of dealing with IBS.
My major problem is the swollen colon, most of my swelling is in the Transverse colon this in tern pushed my stomach up and results in extreme discomfort & pain.
I get periods where the swelling backs off for no reason I can explain, then the swelling starts up again and lasts for months at a time which is so exhausting, I bet this sounds familiar to many reading this.
ONE question, has anyone found anthing that lowers the swelling of there colon either natural remedies or perscription drugs I would be very interisted to hear your remedies on this, any relief would be my dream come true.
Good luck to everone who is suffering with IBS and ALL related problems thatseem to run into each other with a host of different names.

"-21 year old male
- chronic backed up type feeling
- random VERY brief minor abdominal cramps every day( brief as in 10 seconds max largely spaced out throughout the day but more common at night). This is also accompanied with gurgling/ stomach noises etc.
-had bright red blood(like a nosebleed) on a few occasions back in May but don't have any of that anymore. This occurred with intense itching and burning on the outside of the rectum.
-currently have a chronic feeling of being backed up and usually only have a easy movement in the morning but the second time I go( 2 has always been normal) the stool is hard to pass yet it isn't like pebble shaped( probably #2 on stool chart, sometimes 3 or even 4 can be hard to pass) 
- family history of Ulcerative colitis(my mom has it). 
- stool colors all over the map except for black but I have seen dark green(looks darker when wiping but not the stool itself although a Christmas green color will seep out from it after sitting in toilet bowel for a few minutes). The stool itself in this instance is usually brown but has sometimes been grayish green. 
- seen yellowish orange stool a few times during ""more normal"" feeling movements.
- have seen bright blood on stool twice during hemmoroids(around the same time as the blood on the paper)
-have also seen two really small black spots on the SURFACE of the stool(like when a wart turns black).
- often experience itching after a bowel movement(no blood)
- prone to anxiety but don't notice a correlation between anxiety and the symptoms(maybe the abdominal pain)
-overall feeling of passing less per movement despite still going twice a day. 
- taking Prozac 40mg per day( was 20mg a few months ago) 
I plan on scheduling an appointment but I'm posting here in the meantime while I wait because I'm terrified that there's a chance I may have colon cancer( assuming the worst but still). I'm only 21 years old and I read that once symptoms like this are present it has already advanced pretty far. I know it's a worst case scenario but I'm just hoping someone can give me some piece of mind while I wait to schedule an appointment. I just think what else would cause all of these symptoms. Im starting to think it's IBS less and less.

"For the last 10 years my stools have been very small flat pieces when having a bowel movement. It ALWAYS leaves me with incomplete evacuation, and I ALWAYS have some level of discomfort and urge to go after every meal, snack and glass of water. After exercising and showering too. It’s driving me insane! It’s so uncomfortable, I never get any relief.
I have tried everything including the low FODMAP diet which helps a little but even when following that my stool is still just little pieces and I still have discomfort after meals. Metamucil adds a little bulk, but not much, and it too adds to my discomfort.
I don’t know what else to try other than maybe Amitriptyline since that is supposed to be quite helpful with those who have diarrhoea/urgency/loose stools. Does anyone have any experience with that?

"I am feeling quite lost on how to handle my digestive issues. Some context: I am a healthy 21 year old female. I have had no digestion issues until about 2 years ago, when I went to the ER with EXTREME pain in my lower right abdomen. Like, screaming, sweating, crying pain. It was worse than dislocating my shoulder. It went away in 8 hours, and the ER gave me no answers as to what happened. I got an ultrasound and there were ""floating masses"" in my bladder. These have been largely ignored since then because apparently they did not show up on the next ultrasound...but I saw the first ones myself clear as day. Like dark bubbles floating around in an oval, clearly. No kidney stones, no appendicitis...So I was sent home, and the next morning, I went back with the same pain. This time it lasted 6 hours and I still had no answers when it subsided. Ever since then, I've had BAD stomach problems that come and go, but never go away or really improve.
I've never had that kind of extreme pain like I did then, but I do experience pain almost every time I eat anything, in cycles of 1-2 weeks about every other week, so 2/3 of the time. Could be a banana and some cucumbers or a deep-dish pizza, it's all painful during that 2/3. I am extremely bloated in the morning. I am woken up by pain and gas but I can't go to the bathroom until I've been active and upright for a while in the morning. After that I need to go to the bathroom 3-4 times before I even leave the house. I don't go on runs anymore that aren't on a treadmill near a bathroom. Throughout the day my appetite is normal but I still get sick when I eat unless I graze on tiny foods like a mouse ALL DAY, which is almost impossible to do with a busy job that's not always at a desk. Even then...I've had to change my lifestyle a lot. 
I eat a very healthy diet and exercise every day. I rarely drink, and I've tried many exclusion diets: gluten, dairy, etc. I've tried low FODMAP. I've had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, nuclear scan, CT scan, ultrasound, urology testing, blood panels galore...nothing. I feel like I've tried everything. 
My doctors and parents ignore it, but I sincerely think that 2 years ago when I went to the ER, something was messed up in my insides. I'm continuing my research and ignoring my latest doctors' advice to ""keep a food journal and deal with it"" because I found a decent amount blood in my stool this morning. Never happened before, but here we are. Again, I was tested for Crohn's, so...I'm drawing a blank. 
If ANYONE has even an IDEA or VAGUE SUGGESTION literally send it my way I'm leaving no stone unturned. 
Thanks a million

"Hello there,
I am a 25 year old male. Over several years I have had all sorts of medical examinations. Doctors did not find anything out of the ordinary and ""on paper"" I am extremely healthy. They decided its IBS.
I do not remember when my symptoms have started, but I believe it began when was 19 years old and it just became worse with age.
Firstly I poop a lot. Very rarely do I only poop once a day, it's usually like 5-7 times per day. My work/life schedule allows me to be able to do that almost all the time, so it's not that tragic. Nevertheless, I believe it interferes with my decision making. I do not like to sleep over at someone else or go on trips that I will not have a comfortable way of 'going' for a longer time than usual. I believe that that affects my social life and it's not really making me happy either. Another problem with that is that my anus often hurts, because of the frequent pooping. If I eat less than I need, this sort of fixes the problem, but I start losing weight really fast and being hungry does not really make me happy also.
After I eat something I usually instantly feel bad. It has come to such a point that I actually am quite afraid to eat. That doesn't mean that I do (I don't have eating disorders). It's just that I eat because I am hungry, but have that feeling that I will feel bad after it. And I usually do.
The worst part of my day is when I wake up. I always feel really bloated and in need of a poo. Sometimes I can go straight in the morning, sometimes even then I can't. Or I can and then after one hour I need to go again..and again. It seems like I don't poo it all out in one go or something, because between my bathroom visits I don't seem to eat anything. Sometimes I feel as if if I put food in my body, then it pushes out the food before and that is why I need to poo. It's like my capacity is small or something.
Now about my daily routine and habits. Because I know that I have a sensitive stomach (or how do you want to call it) I've learned to adjust my lifestyle according to it, to make it more bearable. I always go to bed at 23:00 and wake up at 7:00 (I understand that having the same sleeping schedule not only should increase my health overall, but should make my body learn when I will eat, go to the bathroom and stuff). I think this helps a little bit but no significant changes. My diet is fairly good. I almost always eat home cooked meals. Eat three times a day. Always at the same time. I always drink a fruit smoothie in the morning (this actually helped a bit also), eat something like chicken with rice and a lot of vegetables at 12:00-13:00 and then something healthy at the evening. My calorie intake is totally average and I don't overeat so I don't really know where the poo is coming from.
Bad habits: I smoke. Quit for a few months to see if that helps and at first it did, but later it just came back to what it was. So started smoking again.
Alcohol. Alcohol always increases my symptoms A LOT. It usually happens a few days after a party, not the day after. Even a few beers may cause symptoms to burst out in flames. I strongly reduced the intake of my alcohol because of that. So now I don't really have these sudden bursts, but overall, I still feel bad most of the time and it did not solve my day to day problems.
In conclusion, I lead a healthy lifestyle, my weight is normal, I exercise. I have a strict routine, I wake up and go to sleep at the time. Eat at the same times and eat healthy. I have never in my life liked sweets, so I don't use sugar probably at all. I drink one cup of coffee a day, at 10:00 (if I drink it when I wake up it just upsets my stomach). My colleagues and friends are all really impressed with how I take care of my body and it seems like I have the cleanest food intake and the most dedicated schedule of everyone around me. I put a lot of effort to do this (not exactly effort, it's just a habit, but I would really enjoy being able to go of rails sometimes, without harsh consequences). 
This kind of makes me depressed (or maybe just sad), because I put so much work to feel at least like a normal human being, while everyone around me do exact opposite and they feel great and I feel like s**t most of the time. I do not think life should be fair, but this is ridiculous, right?
At this moment I don't even ask for happiness, just a little less pain. Also, medicine for pain - does not help. I do not really understand why, but it is what it is.
Forgot to mention, that I've tried various diets. Thought maybe I'm gluten intolerant or something. Also - did not help. What I haven't tried is going vegeterian, but I don't believe that meet is what kills me. I can go all day without it, only with other foods and nothing really changes.
I hope I did not forget to mention something, I thought it would be easier to describe the situation I'm in. I am not even sure its IBS. But I believe that people here also suffer from same thoughts and symptoms and maybe I missed out on something on my lifestyle that could honestly help or even fix me.
Thanks in advance, amigos.

However, nothing much is said about back pain. My IBS spasms start with bad back pain which then spreads round the right side to the front (I think it's called the epigastrium).
It mainly starts in the evenings and can end as abruptly as it starts for no apparent reason, leaving me feeling pretty tired. Otherwise I go and lie down and it eventually eases off.
Does anyone else get this with IBS?

"Hi there, I’ve been diagnosed with ibs since I was 12 and I’m now 21. I can’t seem to find any successful treatment. Imodium does help sometimes but when that wears off the diarrhoea is still really bad! I was wondering if anyone can recommend anything that has worked for them? I am going to try enterosgel as I’ve heard that might be effective but would love to hear from other people!  TIA

"Hi all,
I, as my name suggests, am single. Due to my IBS and IBS related anxiety I find it really hard to meet people. I have a fear of restaurants and eating in front of people and struggle when I am in a situation where it would be embarrassing to go to the toilet. 
I was in a long term relationship and my ex understood what was wrong with me but now I feel at a loss. I don't want to be alone but going out and panicking is crippling me. Plus, explaining to a prospective partner that I have IBS-D is a huge no no before you get to know each other. 
Does anyone else struggle with this or have any advice?
Sorry for the ramble

"Hi. I hope someone out there can help or give me reassurance/clarity.
I am a 48 year old (just) male who suffered badly through teenage years with suspected IBS.
It was never officially confirmed as that way back then, as the condition was still in its infancy in terms of diagnosis and awareness. My GP fobbed me off with 'suffering from nerves or stress.'
I was ill on and of right up to my mid twenties when things began to settle down. Since then, I've had the odd flare up - but nothing too bad or too long lasting.
But then half way through last year, the symptoms returned in full force and have stayed with me ever since.
Because I was never officially diagnosed with IBS, I'm questioning whether it is indeed that, or something more serious. Getting a Doctor's appointment is like gold dust, so I have to wait several weeks until I can see my GP. So I found this forum and thought someone might be able to identify with my symptoms and offer me advice or reasurance.
Firstly, I sometimes have to go to the toilet six or seven times a day. Occasionally more. I can go and then five minutes later feel as if I have to go again. Sometimes I do - and sometimes I don't.
I feel as if I'm going to get diarrhoea and run to the toilet - only to sit there and nothing happens. Yet other times I have to run to the toilet and do go. 
Sometimes, it's full blown liquid diarrhoea. Sometimes the consistency is more like sludge or slurry. Sometimes it's just lots of tiny pieces. And sometimes it's a mixture of all of those.
Going to the toilet can often be preceded by cramps or the feeling that my intestines are 'moving' or being squeezed. It feels as if food is being forcibly pushed or squeezed out of me.
I feel bloated - uncomfortably so, as if my stomach has been pumped up and inflated.
Having read posts from other members, this all sounds familiar to a point. But here's where it then starts to falter.
I often feel like I have a raging temperature, like my head is on fire and is bright red. This normally precedes an attack of the other symptoms and barely lasts more than an hour or so. I NEVER have a temperature nor is my face actually flushed. But it does feel hot to the touch. Does anyone else experience this? And if so, does anyone know why?
Just before and during an attack, I also find I have to urinate a lot more frequently - and urgently. But I can't fathom why the connection could be? Anyone else experience this?
I also feel lethargic and tired. I could quite happily sleep for hours and often fall asleep in front of the TV or on the train on the way home from work if I've been suffering from an attack. Does this sound familiar?
I have a healthy diet - little red meat, lots of vegetables and fruit. I don't smoke and only drink on occasion. 
I try so hard to stay positive. But it's so demoralising. I find myself feeling down more often than not and am wary of going out or away as I don't ever feel I should be far from a toilet. It's kind of depressing.
Do these symptoms sound familiar to anyone?
Thanks in advance for your comments or thoughts.

"Basically... I was on 2 courses of antibiotics (amoxicillin) and whilst on them I had bad diarrhoea (sorry tmi) and towards the end of the course I had just plain pasta and cheese and within about half an hour of eating it I was crippled over in pain, I had never felt pain like it! After roughly an hour it had passed and I didn’t have any problems again. Until about 2 weeks ago I had pasta again and the same thing happened, although I used to always eat pasta (a few times a week) with no problems! Since then I keep getting lower abdominal cramps and currently my pelvis area is very tender and achey and I struggle going to the toilet sometimes! Could this all be caused by the antibiotics? Sorry for the long question!

"To make this as short as possible my husband has been having abdominal issues for years. Like 8 yrs. It started off milder and has progessivly gotten worse. Constant knawing pain in upper left quadrant sometimes into his back. Slightly better after eating and worse first thing in the morning and later on in the day when he is tired. Makes him feel exhausted and depressed. He says it feels almost like nervous knots in his stomach but it is there even when he is not nervous. Daily diarrhea several times a day. Stool floats and/or sticks. Doctor dx'd him with IBS and anxiety because he has had perfect endoscope, colonsocopy, ultrasounds and mri focusing on his pancreas, ducts, spleen and gallbladder. The only thing to ever show was high lipase on bloodwork amd the doctor was not concerned and still said IBS. We live in Canada where public healthcare is free but you can't easily change doctors. Unconvinced with that diagnosos we paid for stool tests privately and sure enough there are irregularities. Have any of you IBS sufferers had quite high calprotectin (787, normal <50) and high steatocrit (33%, normal <15%)? He also had low secretory IgA (6, normal 510-2010). And ideas? I realize we aren't doctors here but any ideas/experiences are appreciated as I am needing to advocate for his health. We have an appt for a second opinion in 2 weeks. Thank you all so much

"Hi everyone I’m new to this forum. I’m 25 years old and as of 3 days ago I was diagnosed with IBS Type A (Mixed). My doctor prescribed me Mebervine and advised me to take peppermint oil capsules. I only picked up the prescription yesterday and I’ve only had 1 tablet. After taking the tablet I felt as though I could barely stand up and my chest had a pressure feeling to it. I then ate as instructed. After eating I felt awake very suddenly and very alert. I had no bowel movement or anything either. However for the first time in a long time I didn’t feel sick after eating. I thought ‘this is great! I feel normal’ until a few hours later when I got the worse pain ever in my chest. I soldiered through despite the pain and went to bed. I’ve woke up this morning and my lower back is in a lot of pain and my chest is in even more pain than it was yesterday. I keep feeling like I’m going to be sick as well. I feel really rubbish! And I feel even more bloated than I did yesterday!
I was hoping someone might be able to advise me if this is normal with Mebervine or not. Whether it’s worth continuing to take it because the pain I’m in isn’t nice at all. I feel worse off than I was beforehand. Obviously with the weekend being here I can’t contact my GP and the hospitals around me are all hit with the norovirus so I don’t fancy my chances with that one.

"I've had this almost every day now and I don't know why. When I pass gas it's hot and has a very strong sulfur/egg smell. I have to spray the room every time I pass gas as it's appalling. My stomach keeps popping inside and making noises while this happens as well. I've tried taking peppermint capsules and some other medication to ease the upset stomach but it only works occasionally. My diet hasn't really been the best lately (eating more junk), so is this the reason? It seems like if I eat more than twice a day I get this. I know it's probably the reason but WHY is it happening? Is it just IBS? Or could it be something more serious?

"I have IBS and I have really been suffering with it lately. 
I am also prone to anal fissues and have a hemorrhoid which I've had for months since the prescribled cream didn't work.
The other night I was very constipated and when I went, It was an extremely painful experience. I tore myself in numerous places and had a huge hemorrhoid afterward, and now i'm afraid to go again.
I normally used to drink very strong coffee to help me go when I felt I might have problems, but coffee has started making me feel very nauseous throughout to day, so I feel reluctant to drink it.
I haven't had any problems like this for months, and I have a well balanced diet, which hasn't really changed, so I believe this problem is down to my IBS. 
I really want a strong and effective laxative to use until this problem passes. Can anyone recommend anything please?
Thank you.

"Hello,
I have suffered from daily diarrhea for 5 months. I worked in England for four months, and sudden diarrhea suddenly occurred.
Daily I have up to 6-7 bouts per day.
I have a little swelling and bruising on my stomach.
She cuts me so hard sometimes that I'm not sure if I'll get to the toilet.
I took strong probiotics did not help, I tested an antibiotic from which I got worse.
- Blood tests as normal
- thyroid gland in norm
- f79 gluten test at normal rate
- Shigella, Salmonella and Candida were not found in faeces
Interestingly, in the morning when I wake up, I have a more normal run,
then 2 cheeses and in the evening I finish with diarrhea.
And all my stools in the water become small dust.
Whether it's diarrhea or do not fall into the water, they begin to become dusty and settle down on the bottom as a passionate food ...
I sleep for 7-10 hours without waking up to the toilet.
I have no loss of appetite, I do not feel dropped or anything else. I only eat boiled rice, baked potatoes, roasted apples and rusks
Sometimes I have severe diarrhea, the next day I only have 1 walk to the toilet and on the third day again diarrhea by eating the same food

"I wish I had the money to go private so my GP surgery would stop treating me like I am making things up! I am getting so distressed and upset I don't know what to do anymore. I cannot change surgery as I live in a really rural area and this one is the nearest and it's 18 miles away and feeling so ill I struggle to get there!
Shortish story. Was diagnosed with IBS when I was 19, I am 33 now. It was manageable for several years but when I got M.E (CFS) in 2009 my IBS went downhill badly with severe constipation non stop. I was simply given a range of laxatives to try and ended up having to take the maximum dose of something I forgot the name of for months.
Last year things got really bad and I started having bad pain in my right side under my ribs aroud the front of my body (not the back). I was sent for a Colonoscopy which came back 'normal' with some colitis. I was told this wasn't a problem and was normal due to the flushing out procedure prior to the exam.
Fast forward to now and the pain in my right side is bad and constant and I've had it for 3 months now, it started around the front and also spreads around the back as well plus been getting twinges in my right groin and sometimes my right hip hurts. I was left for a month as the GP said it was a muscle strain and was given Voltarol gel (didn't work). I went back after a month and handed over a diary I kept of my messed up digestive system and they did blood and urine (checked basics and gallbladder and liver function), all those samples came back as normal and I was told it was 'just IBS' and told to buy Buscopan, I did and it's done nothing. I begged and cried that something was wrong and they scheduled an ultrasound of my Gallbladder wondering if I may have gallstones but the GP acted as if I was a time waster because he kept saying ""for your piece of mind, even though your bloods are fine, gallbladder and liver issues are picked up in bloods and yours are fine"".
The local hospital is so stacked up I have been told I will not get this ultrasound until the end of August. That has left me in dispair as the surgery refuses to push it forward because I am walking and talking and my bloods are fine.
I am now getting pain on my left side under my ribs as well and I have been experiencing explosive and watery diarrhea first thing in the morning which leaves me feeling faint and weak and aggrevates the pain in my right side.
I was told not to take any painkillers incase there was something wrong with my liver so I am hurting with no relief except a hot water bottle which doesn't really help, neither does a cool pack.
I have begged and begged and even written a letter to the practice manager but to no avail, I have just been told to wait for the ultrasound. I am terrified I am going to die of something before the ultrasound (sorry but my Dad died young and suddenly of Liver and Pancreatic cancer because Doctors told him he had IBS) or if I make it to that ultrasound I am worried it will come back as 'normal' and I'm going to be left in agony suffering forever.
I don't know what's wrong, no-one cares and I am struggling to cope emotionally and physically. I cannot leave the house anymore as it hurts to drive and I feel so so ill everyday.
Does this sound familiar to anyone? Is it really 'just IBS'? If it was why do none of the IBS pills work like Buscopan or Colpermin? Could it be Gallbladder? I always thought you had an 'attack' for Gallbladder pain, not constant pain for 3 months? What else could it be?
Thank you so much for any help given, I feel very alone in this, least of all because I have moved house and have no friends or family nearby as this all started a month after I moved.

"I first developed symptoms in my mid teens. A definite need to visit the bathroom twice every morning before my 90 minute journey to school was required to avoid any embarassment. At this time I also developed the occasional but severe abdominal pain and urgent need for a bowel movement about 5 minutes after finishing eating. Very difficult if eating out with no toilets in the vicinity. I have miserable memories of a Sunday School village trip to Aberwystwyth in the early 60's when I spent the whole day walking back and fore between the beach and the public toilets half a mile away! These symptoms continued throughout my time at university and actually got worse with long periods of diarrhoea which on one occasion lasted months. Not good for an active social life. I got little help from the university doctor who after negative results from stool tests was adament that it was just a case of exam worry! I don't think that many medical people at this time had heard of IBS. I do remember at the time of self medicating with the bottles of Kaolin and Morph as mentioned by one of the other posters. It did work but I was always questioned at the chemists when buying it. On one occasion I was prescribed some small white tablets for diarrhoea and I remember them well as they had DF 118 stamped on them. They worked well and I tried save them for important occasions.
About this time I joined the University Air Squadron and had a full RAF medical during which I did not make any mention of my symptoms for fear of not passing. The medics were more worried about me having a possible heart murmur but I passed the medical and was allowed to join the Squadron as an engineer and get the occasional flight to keep me interested. My symptoms remained but with careful management of a couple of trips to the bathroom before doing anything that may last more than an hour, coupled with not eating anything much unless being in close proximity to a toilet I managed. In 1971 I joined the RAF full time as a pilot, and managed to get through the 3 years of training to get to the front line as a Lightning pilot. This was not easy as it required a constant regime of working around my symptoms. This usually meant getting up earlier than most others so I could get breakfast early (one has to eat before flying). This allowed plenty of time after eating for bowel movements, before going to work. I did use the kaolin mixture quite a bit but this was unofficial as I'm not sure it was cleared for flying use. I also avoided eating much during my working day. I was fortunate to get through on to fighters, only 2 of my course of 15 avoided the 'chop' on to bombers or transport. I am sure if this had happened to me then my IBS would have posed a real problem but, with fighter flights lasting rarely longer then 90 minutes I was able, as before to manage the situation. A good job really as when out over the North Sea I was sometimes more than 200 miles from the nearest toilet!!!
I also found that the concentration required while flying did usually help put the IBS out of the mind most of the time. In 1974 however, things came to abrupt halt. I had another long bout of diarrhoea and had tried to keep going as best as possible. I had avoided eating much as everything was just going straight through me and this resulted in some not so clever flying, I managed to scrape the tail on my plane while doing a landing at too lower speed. This was not too unusual with the Lightning but my boss was not very happy. While waiting in the Medical centre for a couple of injections prior to our departure for a month in Cyprus I went flat on my back with a faint, much to the hilarity of all the rest of the guys. They all thought it was the sight of the needle but actually it was the culmination of the diarrhoea and my not eating for days. That was it , the cat was out of the bag, I stayed in the Medical centre for a few days and had to explain all to the 'doc'. I was grounded much to my annoyance pending investigation. A month later I spent 2 weeks in St Marks Hospital in London having every test under the sun from both ends of my digestion system. This was the first time that I heard the term IBS. The only bonus was that I managed to get them to let me out for one afternoon and I went to Wimbledon and managed to see Chrissie Evert who was, and still is a bit of a stunner!! I was given a variety of things to try one being Colovac fibre and a variety of tablets. The Colovac did not help at all and the problem with the tablets was finding something the Medics were happy for me to take while flying. The medical profession are very concerned with the secondary effects of drugs hence the warnings on most things these days ie do not drive or operate machinery, avoid alcohol !! Well a Lightning weighs nearly 30 tons and does Mach 2 and fighter pilots drink beer, so I guess they had to be careful. After much haggling they allowed me to take a low dose of Codeine Phosphate which for me made a fantastic difference. I only take a 15mg dose (this is very small), usually once a day, and it really helps to stabilise my bowel movements and it gives me confidence that I will not suddenly by rushing off to look for a toilet. I have continued to take this for 34 years with no side effects that I know of . The codeine is an opium derivative so people tend to be concerned that you can get addicted. I have not noticed this effect.
After leaving the Airforce I continued my flying career in the Middle East and I have a word of caution here. Most countries there have strict drug laws and codeine is a banned drug. I was fortunate that it was relativly easy for me to take in my own supply of codeine phosphate although it was done with my employer's knowledge and I always had letters in Arabic to explain what the drug was for. Things are different now and quite a few people have been arrested going in to Dubai for having readily available tablets such as 'Cocodamol' which contains codeine. Looking back the DF118 tablets I was given back in the 70's I now see are a dihydrocodeine.
I have now retired and I must admit that life is a lot easier now. The ability to have the option of staying home and not having to do anything on a BAD day is by far easier than having to go to work and hoping all will be well. I do feel that without taking the Codeine I would not have been able to have continued in what was an intense, demanding, stressful BUT fantastic job. Throughout my flying career I always felt a degree of envy of my fellow pilots who did not have to contend with similar IBS problems,and I do feel I had to work a lot harder to succeed. I am not sure that the use of Codeine Phosphate would be allowed for Civilian flying in the UK, all my flying was Military and the use of the drug was always approved by them. I now have the tables issued to me on a repeat prescription from my local health centre.
As a note my Father had an heart operation 4 years ago, some of his follow on drugs gave him diarrhea. Coincidentally he was given Codeine Phosphate tablets by his doctor to help his problem.
So if you have any of my symptoms i.e. the need for more than 1 bowel movement in the mornings, sudden gurgling in the abdomen with pain in the small of the back followed by the urgent unavoidable need to a bowel movement which is usually diarrhea, especially after eating a meal. Then maybe, Codeine Phosphate may be a help to you. I hope so!

"I've had some IBS symptoms (stomach aches, loose bowels, cramping) since around 15 years old. I'd never gone to the doctor for it because it was manageable and because I have a major distrust of doctors. I've also struggled with OCD my entire life and, after a bad flare up last October, decided to try a no dairy no gluten diet to see if that helped my OCD symptoms.
With the new diet, I was eating an increased amount of protein and fiber; which lead to diarrhea. From my research of diet changes, this was normal. The problem was after time, the symptoms kept getting worse, not better. I eventually abandoned my new diet because of worsening nausea and diarrhea, but the symptoms still persist after a few weeks. Nearly two months have passed and all I can eat is white rice and a small amount of yogurt without being nauseated or getting diarrhea shortly after I eat. I feel like I broke my digestive system by eating too much protein and fiber. It sounds dumb, but that's what I feel like. 
Has anyone experienced severe symptoms after changing your diet drastically? My doc also did some blood tests and a stool sample then immediately said it was IBS. Should I trust this? She didn't recommend I go to a GI specialist or get a colonoscopy. 
Last question, have any of you been tested for SIBO or done a round of antibiotics to see if it helps the symptoms.

"Hi all,
 Let me start the story with a bit of back ground, my mother’s side of the family all have IBS, for years I’ve had bouts of what sounds like IBS flare ups but have not formally been diagnosed. These flare ups have been triggered by coffee, I would cut coffee out for about a week and that normally sorts it.
Back in April I was having some ongoing sinus issues, I do have anxiety/OCD issues, whenever I’m ill I think “that’s it I’m dying”, I don’t want to think those thoughts but that’s what my OCD does. With my sinus infection (which is not totally gone but 90% reduced), I was having a lot of anxiety issues, I was also swallowing a lot of post nasal drip.
Around early October time I started getting an ache in my bowel when lying down.  Bowel movements were ok at the start, now I get constipation (sometimes), broken up bowel movements, then a normal Bowel movement, during this I had 7 Text book bowel movements in a row then back to broken up bowel movements. In the mornings, my bowel is full (I can feel its full with my hands), I would have some prune juice and within 30 min I have no problems passing it. It could be broken up and soft, or it could be normal, every so often I get a large bowel movement. When passing I get a sense of relief, within 5 min the nausea kicks in. it can last for a few hours or a whole day. This cycle repeats. The anxiety has now transferred over to my bowel.
 It’s taken 3 weeks to get a GP appointment but because of my age (30) I’m not getting taken seriously.
 Is it possible that this bout of possible IBS be caused by Anxiety and worrying? I do find it strange that my bowel issues had started when I was currently out of my mind with my sinus issue, now that my sinus issue has reduced the bowel issue has taken over.
 Thanks for reading.

"Hey everyone this is my first post on here,
I have had symptoms of IBS for about 5-6 years before doctors finally diagnosed me with IBS about 6 months ago. 
My pains have always been quite severe (had lots of trips to the ER) and low in my abdomen. I also alternate between diarrhea and constipation but mostly suffer constipation. Another symptom I experience is gas/flatulence and rumbling or gurgling in my tummy along with bloating. 
I have been prescribed colofac or colese for the pain which does ease the pain but doesn’t kill it, and I also use a heat pack to have a hot bath which really helps with the pain. 
Yesterday morning I was woken up with excruciating sharp stabbing pains all over my abdomen but mostly up high near my stomach, this was not like my normal IBS pains, I felt fine otherwise, no headache, nausea, vomiting or back pain, just really intense pain and nothing would even take the edge of it, I saw my doc and she said everything felt fine in my abdomen and I could just be constipated, so she gave me buscopan and some powder for the constipation. 
Just asking if other people have had this sort of different pain before and/or pains in the upper section of the abdomen with IBS?
Thanks in advance!

"Hi all, sorry to post this but I wanted to ask you all a big question,
About a year ago I started getting this feeling like I had something just inside my anus, just annoyed me a little so. I went to the doctors and he sent e for a camera... I went and it caused me to much pain they had to stop, I went for another and the prep didn't work... Although the feeling had gone anyway for several months.
So now I'm here again and have this same feeling. I also get a feeling I need to go then nothing.
I have a exam from a doctor the other day (finger up my butt) he said there was nothing there I also took on still samples and had bloods just waiting for results.
I'm 27 and ATM the symptoms I have are a little weird.
I use to have IBS D, I could nearly control my bowels, well recently I don't go as much, when I do it feels like it's difficult for it to come out. And when it does it's all lose, it does burn a little when I go as well. And I get a little stomach pain from time to time. Feels more like wind some times.
And I am passing a lot more gas.
Other then that the only issues is my tail bone kills to sit or touch.
I have no blood, no weight loss, I eat fine. My diet has never been good but I did start eating a bit more. Veg recently.
Does anyone have any ideas? I think I'm going to push for another camera up there.
Thank you all for reading.

"Hello everyone, 
I have recently been diagnosed with ibs after numerous doctors visits and a few months of discomfort, altered stools etc. 
I am just a little worried, I struggled with bulimia and anorexia for five years of my life and I was wondering if the pain I am feeling would equate to ibs? 
Could anyone tell me if they have felt the same: 1)  acute, sharp abdominal pain (at anytime) 2) burning, chronic pain lower and mid abdomen 3) dark, yellow or black stools on occasion 4)tender, gassy stomach. 
Again, I have seen my gp several times and I take regular peppermint oil etc now but would be so appreciative if anyone could data they’ve shared any of these symptoms.

"I was wondering if anyone has itchy skin and sensitivity to temperature related to their IBS? 
I often itch all over my body, but most noticeably on my face and scalp. It seems to be worse in the morning, and especially if I wake up constipated. I have noticed I’m also quite itchy after drinking coke or coffee sometimes, and sometimes after a nap. It’s quite irritating sometimes. 
I also am very sensitive to temperature. In winter I’m often overly cold and shivery. Drinking cold drinks, in winter or not, also makes me feel cold and shivery. I constantly have to keep adjusting the temperature in my room and when I take showers too. 
Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

"Hello. My name is Nate. And I'm getting kind of worried... but it might be nothing.
I am a 27 years old male and overweight (225 pounds at 5'2"", so could be worse, could certainly be better... and I'm dieting, which I'll explain later), and have been since my late teens.
For YEARS, I've had some problems with constipation and never feeling fully done. But it was merely a minor nuisance. It's never been as bad as its been in the past couple of weeks.
I have no issurance, so getting checked by a doctor could be steep.
My symptoms for years have been...
--constipation, mild. pretty regular other than needing to struggle a bit
--feeling of needing to go, but being unable
--occasional diarhea
--pretty frequent gas, hard to pass
--groin and lower back pain when these were really bad
--blood in stool (and on toilet paper) maybe two or three times a year, maybe for a couple of days. most likely hemmorroids, to be honest, brought on by straining from aforementioned consipation
--a small pain in my right abdomen. not really that bad, never more than a few minutes. again, could be completely unrelated and be from a crappy diet
Now, up until a few weeks ago, I ate like CRAP. I mean, not Big Macs everyday, but still really greasy food with little regard to how it'd treat me. What IS interesting, is that I'd eat sandwiches a lot, and bread has a lot of fiber, right? So, shouldn't that help with constipation? Note, that I'm a linguist, not a doctor, so I could be totally wrong on that one.
My symptons for the past few weeks...
--constipation, pretty bad. maybe once or twice a day like normal, but very difficult and very little
--narrow stools. not like pencil thin, more like flatter charcoal pencils. kind of oblong. if they even HAVE a shape
--constant feeling of needing to go
--very frequent gas, even harder to pass
--groin and lower back pain when these are really bad
--no blood in stool
--no pain in right abdomen
The worse constipation and narrow stools are what're bothering me. Could this be IBS? And it's just getting worse? Or could it be something more sinister, like colon cancer?
Now, my diet is... kind of crappy. It's basically eating store-bought health TV dinners with the occasional salad (and I like the salad I make! I'm just not always in the mood for it). Keeping calories down, at least. What I think is missing from my diet is fiber. Could the change in diet from some fiber but crap everything else to decent stuff to little fiber just be exacerbating my original problem?
Now, the diarhea certainly gets bad after a cheat day, where I revert to my previous diet for a day, plus maybe a salad. So, I think that just makes sense.
I don't have much abdominal pain, except when it'd make sense, no increased nausea, and I haven't vomitted since I was maybe eleven. I'm an occasional coffee drinker, maybe a cup or less a day, maybe twice a day if I have D&D that night (or else I'm totally useless to the party).
Thank you anyone who can provide any help, solace or orders to go to the emergency room.

"(first about me : 32 white male 5 foot 5 225lbs)
oct 8th was given fluconazole for something on my genitals that the doctor said was balantitis.
fast forward 10 days, treatment is complete and began experiencing the following symptoms that continue to today:
fluctuations in bowel movement frequency, consistency, and color(orange, light brown, normal color. never any sign of blood). including soft bowel movements, lots of pieces jagged edges, diarrhea, and thinner(not pencil thin at all. more like a range from dry erase marker size and just a bit thinner than normal. some appearance of mucus in stool as well as undigested food (red vegetable skins, lettuce, nuts)
abdominal pain and cramping that is intermittent and never severe. excessive gas also hemorrhoids twice since oct 8th (this today has resulted in a narrow dry erase marker size stool presented with the usual lots of pieces jagged edges and undigested lettuce, nuts, red vegetables )
i began taking a probiotic and something for a reoccurring acid reflux problem on dec 22. this has helped with normalizing frequency of bowel movements to once a day either morning or evening, as well as adding more fiber (oatmeal) to my diet
none of this appears to be a serious issue as it does not inhibit day to day life in any way nor is anything so severe i've considered going to the er or anything nor has significant weight loss occurred
could this be ibs/ibd/chrons?

"I've always had IBSsymptoms going back to when I was a kid. Over the past 6 moths I have acquired most of the classic ones- abdominal pain that moves around, excessive gas, bloating, cramps, urgency that relives pain most of the time and inconsistent stools. However recently had an episode that changed my bowel movements considerably and made me feel pains in my back, I was also reminded that my dad has Colitis. This made me quite concerned.
So I went to the doctor and he ordered some tests. My blood tests came back normal (including the inflammation marker and normal celiac reading), I haven't got my stool test back yet.
Over the past few days. I've felt a little flushed sometimes without a temperature and watering eyes. I also suffer from extremely strong anxiety and I don't know how much that's contributing to this.
Obviously I can't rule it out yet but can I get some opinions? I don't have any symptoms of colitis or chrons apart from slightly irritated eyes but it's that family connection that's troubling me deeply.

"Hello, I'm kevin borjas, I'm 21 years old. a few years ago my father had a colonoscopy and he was told he has IBS. so for awhile know I had been scared about having IBS.
A few months ago I started having symptoms, including bloating, abdominal pain, and excessive gas
This was most scary when I had rectal bleeding, I freaked out,and I started thinking my symptoms were from something else more dangerous like colon cancer .I had rectal bleeding when going to the bathroom for 2 days and then it stop. I had lift a lot of weight that week in work, so I assumed it was hemorrhoids. 
I still took a fecal test and it said negative for blood. 
So the bleeding stop and everything else kept going, I'd like to point out that at this point my stools were perfectly fine. 
but then 2 months later I started having weird looking stools. The day before I had a normal and fine stools, but this one day I had a really thin stool, and I got scared again. 
Since then my stool was never fine again, it's really inconsistent, some days its thin, and some days its normal size, some days its watery and some days its loose and some days its narrow. its been a months since the first time I had a thin stool. My stool color is the only thing that has been consistent, its brown, and sometimes pale brown, but no other color. 
Is this normal in IBS or could this mean something worse?
My stool changes worry me.

"Today and part of yesterday was pretty unpleasant, because I've been having a painful throbbing sensation in my abdomen on the right, along the hip, and in my mid back. All of it is on the right side, which is only adding to my worry. I know that logically this could be a flare up, since I had a lot of bread yesterday, which is a trigger food for me, but I can't stop worrying about appendicitis and other horrible and deadly diseases. The pains sort of feel like muscle spasms and they're really driving me crazy. I'm also feeling a lot of nausea and some shortness of breath. Is there some way I can calm myself down, or maybe sooth the pain and/or nausea? I don't want to freak out and run to the hospital again but I'm really worried, and I need to somehow get myself to stop jumping to the absolute worst conclusions first. I've done the press test on my abdomen quite a lot and I haven't felt anything besides the usual discomfort that comes with jabbing myself in the gut, so logically I should be able to rule appendicitis out but you know me. I'm always dying of something.

"Hi. I was told years ago that I have IBS. It started with pains that I am so sure kicked in due to nerves. I've always had that hair trigger mind-gut connection where if i felt any anxiety I pooped right away. Burning pain in pelvis at 39, but nothing else. Pain in left quadrant, colonoscopy clean, doc said it was nerves. Supposed GERD attack at 42, huge pain in my stomach, turned out I had a tiny hiatal hernia. If figured the pain was due to that. I figured the nerves caused it. 
March 2015 clean colonoscopy. Not many pains in before that. November 2015, had a cuban coffee, felt spasms down my gut and then 5-6 weeks of diarrhea, intermittent with it trying to form, and a feeling like my rectum was swollen. THen it normalized. No pain.
2017, I had an attack the morning after Thanksgiving. Ended up in the ER with what they called colitis. Midway in Transverse colon down to the descending colon. IT said ""Consider infection/inflammation over ischemia"" and the doc said it was ""focal point colitis."" He said I'll feel better but to follow up with my GI doc.
GI doc is thinking it's infectious colitis. I had symmetrical arthralgia ( pain but no swelling) in shoulders and in my spine weeks before this, and even felt soreness in the corners of my mouth, but he's not convinced it's Crohn's at this point, though when I brought it up, he acknowledged that there's a small possibility.  He gave me the ""you have to manage your stress"" talk and ""think of the glass half full, you don't have a Crohn's diagnosis"" thing. 
If this IS Crohn's, it's been very slow to advance. I'm 48 and my first ever gut issues started around 39 I would say. I had chills and dizziness in the ER but no fever. Right now except for the pains in my sides and the difficulty in having a bowel movement any time except mornings ( I feel no pains in the mornings), I feel perfectly normal. In fact by and large I feel like I could play in a baseball game! It's just my gut. 
Still, I'm going for a 2nd opinion Jan 2nd and I'm concerned. I don't want to miss anything important but I don't want to be over diagnosed or mis diagnosed either. They say ""Keep looking for trouble and you'll find it"" and of course, I saw a Crohn's list post where one patient said ""I hate 'IBS.' I have so many patients who come in saying they have IBS and it's IBD!?""
Click here to view image
So anyway, I looked online and saw a paper that said ""IBS with colitis Neutrophils"" and of course I saw something else along the lines of saying IBS can have immune mediated effects.
So I have no idea what to think. It's about Christmas and I hate to ruin my holiday with worry. Worry won't help and will only hurt.
Has anyone here with IBS had reason to think they really had IBD and they were thankfully wrong? Some people can have BOTH! And there are overlapping symptoms at times. Hoping for some responses that can give me positive things to think about.
Thank you!

My stool is all split up into lots of pieces so I have loose stool but not diarrhea. Stool seems to get all separated as it travels through me and causes incomplete evacuation. When I eat, or exercise or whatever my gut moves the stool along so that I keep feeling the need to go even if the urge isn't strong enough to go yet. There's not enough bulk in my stool for nice firm pieces to come out.

"I am 29 yo. For the past month I've felt like I have something in my rectum, like I haven't emptied it completely and I have a piece of something stuck in there.
Sometimes I can even feel a sort of tickling there, it's very annoying and disturbing. I feel it more when I focus on it and this symptom started after I've been paying attention to my BMs because I thought I saw bits of red in it (which were proven to be food). But the feeling of fullness, tightness and foreign body inside persists. Some days it's better, but in the last 4 days it's almost constant.
I don't have diarrhea or constipation, just gas and minor bloating in my colon. I go around 2-3 times a day but the feeling persists even after a BM. And it's more noticeable when I stand up.
I also had this feeling last October after a bout of diarrhea and it lasted a couple of weeks and disappeared. And it started again this January after being stressed over my BMs.
Is this feeling common to IBS? Or maybe hemms? I'm a huge hypochondriac and worry about having a polyp or a cancer there.
My last colonoscopy was 4 1/2 years ago and nothing found.

"Does anyone suffer from IBS and could you tell me if this sounds like it?
For too long now I've always struggled with constipation or diarrhea. I can sometimes go days without emptying my bowels. My stool is sometimes little lumps, sometimes diarrhea (quite a lot) or I can't push anything out at all. It keeps changing continuously.
Lately I've been under a lot of stress and anxiety due to another health problem that has been sorted out.
However, now sometimes when I eat I'll get a cramp pain just below my belly button, it will last for 5 or 10 minutes and it will go away.
Today I ate a sausage, egg, bacon and beans sandwich and after I ate it the same thing happened. I ended up with a pain below my belly button that got worse as I walked. It's like a cramp, tightening feeling all along my stomach under the belly button. The pain doesn't last longer than 10 minutes. When I got home, I managed to empty my bowels for the first time in a few days and the stool was in bits.
I don't know if this will help but When I'm on my period the cramp makes me want to crawl, it's agonising and I get shooting pains in my anus sometimes and stomach (this type happens on my period).
Also, I feel a lot of wind lately. I either struggle to pass gas or I'm passing gas too much.
Sometimes I can eat a lot of food and sometimes I can't. It just depends.
Does this sound like it?

"Hi all, 
Sorry if this is gross, or in the wrong forum, but I'm very concerned and would really appreciate if someone could help me.
For the past month or two, I've been experiencing a strange bowel movement that has me concerned. When it 'hits', it feels like I'm going to have diarrhea. I go to the restroom, and there's a lot of pressure, and then a huge, loud, explosion of gas. With it, there is nothing but a small, string-like, clearish-yellowish... thing? I will have this several times in a day, and it will go away after I have a normal bowel movement. 
Can anyone explain what this might be, if this is an IBS symptom, if this may be something serious? I am planning to see a nutritionist and a gastroenterologist in the new year, and I have been tested for food allergies. 
If it is not something serious, does anyone know how to fix it?

"Hi,
I have had bowel issues for the last 7/8 years. I have had blood and stool tests for celiac and gluten intolerences, diary intolerences, everything, and everything has come back normal. Ive had a barium x-ray (normal) and a CT scan of my bowel which showed I was 'impacted' and the gastro I was seeing at the time simply prescribed really strong laxatives which have caused nothing but more symptoms of nausea, bloating and diareah in an attempt to clear my bowel.
I suffer from bloating, nausea, infrequent upper abdominal pain, gas with wind, and anything I eat seems to go straight to my bowel making it feel bulky and impacted straight after I eat even though Im constipated. I spend hours in the bathroom everyday trying to pass stools and feel like I havent 'gone' properly had my bowel is just generally sore and, bulky. Ive tried eliminating pretty much all foods on the FODMAP diet and everything containing gluten and nothing has helped. Im at a point where Im eating very little because im frustrated and cant bare to eat in fear that im going to feel sick and uncomfortable (which means im now very underweight).
Can anyone shed some light on my situation?
Thanks

"Hi all,
I am female 34 years old and recently have been noticing symptoms that I believe are IBS. Now I think about it I have probably had many of the symptoms mildly for some time.
I always wake up feeling a bit uneasy in the tummy and have never been ae to stomach breakfast until 10am or so despite getting up at 7am.
The main thing I am noticing that is new is a tightening feeling in my colon area and it feels tight amd bloated. Is that a common thing with IBS?

"Hello all,
Lately I've been dealing with an assortment of digestive issues. I'm an 18 year old male, 5'3, 115lbs (gaining, not losing weight). Three weeks into my first semester of college, I was having some digestive issues in terms of it felt like I had to use the bathroom but anytime I'd try, nothing would come out or small amounts of feces(solid) would come out and some mucus. I went to the doctors and they did a liver blood test and took a stool sample, all checked out fine. A week or so later, I ended up being diagnosed with bronchitis and being put on a course of antibiotics to be taken twice a day.  A week or so after finishing the antibiotic, my stools were really loose and had red spots and red thin sticks in or near them. I told my doctor about this and they gave me a pancreas blood test and set me up with a GI doctor. I ended up getting a colonoscopy which detected some inflammation on my lower rectum that biopsies showed was not chronic(i don't remember what they told me it officially was other than to not worry about it). Now, lately, I've been still feeling pressure there, sometimes after peeing I need to wipe my butt as well and there will be some green liquid and there's still the red sticks when I poop. Also, my poop sometimes will come out different shades of brown on the same stool. Can anyone give me any information on what any of this could mean and how it's related? I'm seeing the GI doctor again on Thursday, but this has been seriously bothering me.
Note: I'm not diagnosed with IBS, they said it's a possibility.
Thank you.

"Hi everyone
I've recently been diagnosed with IBS c.
My GP finds piling me with laxatives is the solution yet i find these can often make me worse.
I wonder if i struggle to tolerate fibre due to low transit after suffering with an eating disorder for 11 years. I'm now at my best weight in over 6 years but things are just getting worse because I can't seem to find a solution to help me with my symptoms. I have done some research of my own as i feel my GP is just making excuses to why my digestion is as bad as it is. Often I get told it's all in my head,but i know what I am experiencing is not normal and is effecting my life and wellbeing. I an hoping to get a slow transit test to find out if food travels to slow which could be the main cause but I have no idea how I would do this. Does anyone have any advise how I can self refer or go private and what cost I would be looking at?This is my last bit of hope now x

"I've had problems with constipation and general digestive discomfort for years, mainly due to adhesions restricting digestive transit and IBS. One of the main problems is the shear amount of gas I get, that is also trapped and difficult to get rid of, unless I'm alone and completely relaxed. I have to curl up on the couch to get rid of it, nothing else works. Even then it's difficult. It has being ruining my life for years, I can't socialise, go on holiday, have friends round to stay. I'm pushing my boyfriend away cos I'm in pain whenever he is around. I can't stay anywhere new, even on my own without it making constipation and trapped gas worse. Things are really bad, I'm isolated and getting down. In the last two weeks, it has somehow managed to get even worse, I'm struggling to make it through the day at work now, due to gas pain, despite getting up early in the morning, 2hrs before work to make sure I have time to get rid of gas and go to the loo. I spend all evening farting too. Is it worth going to the GP? Or do they just fob you off with advice to try eliminating things from your diet and try daft remedies like simethecone and charcoal.
I'm already on Laxido and Ispagula Husk for constipation. I've tried everything herbal and drug remedy there is and tried eliminating things, but nothing works. Only thing I've found I have to careful with is too? much products with yeast in, ie bread. Any thoughts guys?

"In Jan 2016 when I went to the toilet I noticed I had blood in my stool and I went to the doctors who said it was probably just a tear. Feeling relived I hoped it would go away however every time I went to the toilet there was always blood. Then I had constipation and felt like I never needed to go so back to the doctors and they gave me laxatives. These didn't really work and when they did I had a upset stomach. I began feeling unwell and had pain stomach pains and went back to the doctor who eventually arranged a colonoscopy. I was terrified, during the procedure they found a polyp in my rectum that was sent away and came back it was not cancerous. They advised me that the problems I had should now go away. A year on and I still cannot go to the toilet I don't go for a week and then i end up taking laxatives which make me feel ill. I have gone back back to the doctors and they said there's no more that had be done and could be ibs. I'm struggling and feeling ill, I've had bad stomach pains and never go to the toilet only if I take laxatives. Anyone know why this could be? I'm worrying a lot and during the colonscopy they didn't enter both the small and large intenstine (only one) can't remember which one It was.

"Hi! First post here. I'll give some background info, I'm 18 years old, female, and up until around September, I always had a normal digestive system. I went through a small cycle of not eating enough and overexercising around July-November, and that's when it all went south. I have had constipation and diarrhea problems since then. When I do have a bowel movement, it is forced, sometimes bloody, and extremely hard. I never feel like I can fully empty my bowels. Around september (the time that the constipation began), I also started to get acne. It's spread out in random spots, but never seems to heal fully and always comes back in the same place. Due to it's inability to respond to topical treatment, I'm wondering if it could be a result of my IBS. Has anyone else dealt with this, and does anyone have solutions to treat this? Please help, I am desperate for any kind of solution at this point. I have bad stomach cramps and I'm tired of my skin looking like this. Thanks so much.

"Hi I need some advice on how to solve the issues I have been facing.
Some history, early this year I started to notice rectal bleeding, went to see the doctor who dismissed it as hemorrhoids after performing DRE and gave me laxatives. The laxatives didnt help much however the bleeding stopped after few days. Few months down, I suffered from very stressful time including sinus operation and other issues. Post operation, I started to have bleeding again and after much convincing and after several GP visits, was sent in for sigmoidscopy (during this whole time I was very concerned and continuously worried). The investigation was all clear and nothing was found. I continued to have symptoms like some rectal bleeding, gas, occasional abdominal pain, right rib cage lower pain, rectal pressure. I was still under stress and after having more bleeding was sent to see a gastroenterologist who didn't perform colonoscopy but diagnosed me with IBS-C and detected internal hemorrhoids (proctoscopy) . I had been straining but did have BM every day for several months prior to this. Till that points I had to go several times but never felt fully empty after BM and had all symptoms. I was reassured that i have ibs-c and nothing else. However with continued worry about not having the colonoscopy, I went in to see the GP several times more to convince them to get me further investigation as I still had symptoms. Finally the GP agreed and I had the colonoscopy.
The colonoscopy came back all clear. Colon, rectum and anus was checked and all was clear. 
Post colonoscopy (as it was clear, i became relaxed) however now I started to have worst BM (in terms of very hard stools). Although I had been going almost daily, it seems the constipation got worse (again in terms of hard stool and not being able to fully empty). Few weeks after the colonoscopy I went in to see the GP again who did DRE and felt big internal hemorrhoids/lump on one side, that is the side I feel pain on when wiping after BM and that was the main reason I went to see the GP. It is a specific point on one side that hurts but I do not feel any lump or mass but the GP while DRE could feel big lump further inside. The problem now is that although the investigations are clear, I am not sure why i feel the pain at a point on one side on anus opening. Can it be due to nerves that get touched on wiping (eventually) linked to the hemorrhoids? The doctor has told me it will takes weeks for hemorrhoids to settle down but hasnt given me any cream or ointment to use.
The question I have is firstly related to IBS, how can I sort it out. it seems that is no exact answer. i have been taking fibre and eating more healthy stuff and drinking more water but symptoms still persist, although my stress levels are way down now. I do understand that IBS might take long to sort itself out.
Secondly if the pain I feel in the anal reason is due to hemorrhoids, how can I get rid of them or why they keep coming back. I will confess that I had to strain and have had really hard stools (post colonoscopy). I have also seen small red flakes for last few months as well, that seem local from the anal region and maybe related to the hemorrhoids but I guess i still have some worry about the anal region, if that pain is due to something else. I do not want to annoy the doctors as I have had the clear colonoscopy and clear sigmoidscopy.

"Please. Anyone. Ever since the second week of July, I don't think I've went more than 4 days without symptoms. It started with what I thought was just a stomach bug. I was driving to work when all of a sudden I got really anxious, started sweating and felt that ping in your stomach when you think you're about to literally crap your pants. I knew I had diarrhea, as soon as I pulled in to work I ran up the stairs and went. Thought I was going to die. Texted my boss from the bathroom telling her I was here but sick. Ended up going home. I'm going to be honest, I don't remember my symptoms after that. I remember A LOT of gas. It wasn't until August when I went to Indiana with my now fiance that I was still feeling sick. Nausea, stomach cramping, anxiety, sweating, chills, loss of appetite...went to a doctor who referred me to a gastoenterologist. She scheduled a colonoscopy, it came back fine minus some internal hemerrhoids. It is now almost December and all I have is a ""supposed"" IBS diagnosis. I have had 3 of what I now call ""spells"" since then. I get extremely nauseous, panicky, feel like I'm going to throw up and pass out. I shake, it almost feels like a constant tremor. The last week of September, I couldn't eat for 3 days. I had no appetite, I was having a ""spell."" Went to Urgent Care because I knew I was dehydrated and I literally felt like I was withering away as I had called off work all weekend. They took a urinalysis and said I didn't have a strong infection but she noticed some cells clinging to the dipstick as she pulled it out. I had some slight discomfort in my lower left side towards the back, and I had also been peeing a lot which idk how because I hadn't eaten anything and was barely able to drink water. She said it was a UTI. Put me on omnicef, antivert and zofran for nausea to try and get my appetite back. 2 days later my boyfriend proposes to me, unfortunately while I was still sick (but YAY!) Anywho, I have been going to a psychiatrist because I know my anxiety isn't helping and I'm stuck in a loop. I can't get out. HELP ME. I am literally starting to become suicidal and depressed. It's tearing my life away from me. I feel SO terrible that my fiance is putting up with me, it makes me wonder why he wants to even still marry me. My gastro I haven't seen since my colonoscopy because she's been so booked. I don't go until 12/15/17. I never want to eat. I'm TERRIFIED. I don't have an appetite, I'm dizzy all the time. My IBS is mostly constipation, but today now that I got all of that out, I have D. WTF. I am literally so scared to ever leave my apartment. I'm afraid of all the things I used to love, such as food, socialization. I feel like this is more than IBS and anxiety, honestly. I want her to test me for a parasite, there HAS to be something else going on. I am so unhappy and I just don't know what to do anymore...someone please help me. I printed out papers for FMLA but I know I have a slim chance of her signing the papers because I struggled with a WPA for work so I can go to the bathroom when I need to go. I'm so scared I'm going to lose my job and that this is never going to go away. How does anyone live like this...
I'm so sorry for the long rant, I am just literally at wits end and find myself crying sporadically because I have no other idea what to even do. I can't even get into counseling until 12/5...and I booked that the beginning of October....

I could have diverticulitis and when I was in hospital wasn't given any pain relief and even my doctor didn't give me pain relief. I've rang my doctors today in pain and been informed I can take Mebeverine, yet again which doesn't help so was offered domperidone instead but have never taken it told it's a tablet and it's small.

"My symptoms started well over a year ago. I had a sudden onset of constipation which went on for a few days which I managed to remedy.
I remember when that was going on that I felt bloated and discomfort under my ribs as if something was struggling to get out from under them !
This was particularly noticeable under my left rib.
After that BMS returned to normal and no issues since but I still have the almost daily discomfort of this feeling that something is swollen under my left rib.
I have also had occasional flare ups of what might be described as a swollen lymph node on my neck. It can happen either side but never both.
Not long after the initial onset of alleged IBS I had a UTI which I think is not common for males. GP confirmed with test in surgery which showed white blood cells and minor trace of blood indicating infection.
A course of antibiotics cleared this and no recurrence.
I have no apparent urinary issues related to prostate etc.
Have been reviewed by GP a couple of times and both times examined, and stated IBS
I often monitor weight and BP and all is normal.

"I am a 25 year old female.
So Ive been dealing with ALOT of digestive issues for over a year now. It had started when I was experiencing terrible pain in my lower abdomen and I went to a walk in and they had sent me to the hospital because I guess they thought it could be my appendix. So i went there and got a ct scan done. That showed I had colitis. They put me on antibiotics and such and then a couple weeks later i had a colonoscopy. My doctor said it was all clear. That it must have been an acute infection and must have cleared up. Problem was even after that I was still having terrible pains all the time! He had said I had ibs, but was like in between or something. Because i wasnt always constipated nor was it always liquid. This continued for a couple months. Pain, exhaustion everything.
Then I ended up being woken up one morning in so much pain I couldnt even move. I told him about it at my next appointment. Got an ultrasound sound done. And found out I had gallstones. Then had surgery to remove my gallbladder. Fast forward a bit and nothing has changed. Im still in pain every single day. And going to the bathroom was sooo painful. Id be in the bathroom for like up to an hour sometimes. And there were times where I would start to feel super light headed and dizzy and nauseous. And my body would feel like it was on fire, I would just start heating up and feel like I was gonna pass out. When I told my doctor he was super confused about that!!
I have terrible reflux that even the nexium he prescribed me wasnt doing much. It took away the burning, but I always have this like lump feeling in my throat. He finally decided to do an endoscopy. And that showed I have a hiatal hernia and gastroparesis!
He told me that I hadnt eaten in over 12 hours, but my stomach was filled with food. He was stumped saying that usually the cause of that is diabetes, which I dont have! He never even gave me an answer as to why I have it. Instead he said something about how maybe my bowels arent moving things so its backing up and thats making my stomach back up too? Like a motility issue thru my whole digestive tract. So he put me on Linzess. So I take that every other day now, and its helped a lot. Im not in pain nearly as often, but all those things are still there. Just less often.
I have figured out a few foods that aggravate the symptoms more and stay clear of them. Biggest one if ground beef! big no no.
So Im wondering if anyone has gone through anything similar and what ended up happening. Im just annoyed I never really got a real answer about any of it. LIke i feel like its way more than just ibs. Ive tried doing some research and stuff about the vagus nerve comes up a lot. But Im not sure. Just wish I had an answer.

"Hello,
I'm looking for advice from other people in this forum regarding some unfortunate symptoms which has taken over my life since recently.
About a week and a half before April of this year I noticed a funny feeling in my stomach. It's hard to explain but the feeling was uncomfortable. When April began, I started experiencing mild abdominal pains and a change in overall bowel movements (sometimes solid other times loose).
I went to my GP who said I was saying I'm too young for these symptoms and even asked if cancer runs in my family (a bit odd but it doesn't). He sent off a CEA (cancer marker test) which came back normal and also did a Barium Enema test which also showed no abnormalities and that everything was normal.
Upon bringing the barium enema results to him he simply seems to suggest it could be IBS or something else, prescribed meds which he said I should take if I have ""another attack"".
What puzzles me is, what attack? I've pretty much told him that these symptoms have pretty much persisted from the start of April (some days it's hardly noticeable). After the Barium Enema test, my symptoms had eased about a week but they're pretty much back. I've also noticed pain near my rib section and on my left side and the mild pain in my stomach still continues.
Full Symptoms:
- Abdominal pain started around navel section but is now general throughout my abdominal area
- Growling stomach
- Diarrhea (semi-solid to diarrhea)
- Felt sudden pain in left side of stomach/rib area which was worst when lying down. That was just one night.
- Sometimes using the bathroom relieves me of symptoms for a while
- Mild pain usually comes on throughout the day but is never really felt in the morning when I wake
I really want to know for those with ""IBS"" does symptoms last this long? Based on research it seems IBS should not persist this long (typically 2-4 days then goes).. So, all in all, I'm confused and a little worried. I've booked myself to see a specialist since he wouldn't really recommend one but I'd like to know the thoughts of others.
Sorry for the long ""essay"", looking for some advice. Thank you for listening.

Stomach problems have been the worst of it, and over the last couple years it always seems to feel like my body is being 'attacked' when I get constipated. I will notice it being hard to use the bathroom then all the sudden usually at night my stomach will start to hurt then I will have diahreaa like bowel movements repeatedly throughout the night, also accompianied by feeling hot and cold and shaky and my face will get flushed as well as miserable overall.

"Hi Everyone, hoping someone else has experienced this. Whenever I eat foods that contain MSG such as sauces from the Chinese that are no doubt laced with it. Or just Chinese food in general, no more than 30 minutes afterwards i'm in agony with the normal IBS discomforting pain cramps diarrhoea and all the other wonderful effects of IBS. Even if I try to avoid MSG it sneaks in somewhere and knocks me for six. Today was some M&S Satay chicken skewers, being M&S I thought I would be safe. Well nope.. 30 mins later like clockwork I was absent from the table in agony in a guests bathroom. Really embarrassing and not at all convenient, especially when no one else suffers from it, so doesn't understand what its like or how it feels. The usual culprits for MSG are Chinese food, sugary sauces like ketchup or brown sauce. Does anyone else get this? I know most people sometimes suffer from an upset stomach following a curry or Chinese and MSG is normally to blame, but even in very small quantities it seems to ruin my day. Wondering if anyone else's IBS just wont tolerate MSG?

"Hi there,
I am a 17 year old female, diagnosed with IBSD when I was 10. I have always been stuck in as cycle of anxiety and IBS, and find that occasions where I feel as though I cannot easily get to a loo make me anxious and have a flare up spurred on by anxiety attacks (e.g. on public transport, in social situations, even when I'm in a long conversation with someone that I feel as though I can't get out of). I also have IBSC symptoms when I have a few days with no events that will make me anxious (e.g. no school at the weekends). I have been to many doctors appointments, been prescribed loperamide, mebeverine, peppermint capsules, buscopan, and amitriptyline to name a few. I have searched many forums also, had CBT for over a year, had accupuncture, tried the FODMAP diet (leaving me with little foods left that I could eat with no symptoms), homeopathy and felt a bit at a loss. I eventually came across a forum recommending Manuka Honey. I, like you probably, didn't believe it would make a difference and pushed it to one side but two months later stumbled across the same forum and decided to give it a go while Holland and Barrett had their penny sale on as it's very expensive. I'm pleased to say that in the span of 3 weeks since i started taking 2 teaspoons (UMF 24) a day I have not had one bout of diarrhea. This has reduced my anxiety greatly. I'm so pleased to have found something natural that works for me and wanted to share it with anyone that has similar issues to me.
P.S. If anyone is going to give this a go, I found out that legit Manuka will always have 'UMF' and then a number, which should preferably be 16+.

"Hi there, both new to this forum and newly diagnosed (3 months) I have suffered years with both flare ups of constipation and diarrhea. Normally with a flare up I have loose watery stools once and then my stomach is fine again, but over the past few days every time I eat (anything) I have had watery stools straight after but otherwise feeling completely fine.
because of this I took Imodium yesterday. The watery stools have stopped now but my stomach is gurgling really loudly pretty much most of the day and I feel as if I need to poop but nothing is coming out. For the people who do suffer with IBS does this sound more like a flare up or just some kind of stomach bug I picked up?

"In my previous posts I've explained about Ginger use for people who have a cold , or influenza ...
But for the ones who suffer from IBS like me,
Ginger is an amazing remedy for any bacterial disease and infection in stomach and intestines.
Even it cures burning pain in stomach and reflex.
Unfortunately, I have reflex, and Ginger during a short time made me feel better.
I also suffer from IBS and constant bloating and constipation.
Recently using Ginger has helped me ,to a large extent, to get rid of the gas in my abs.
?Try to dissolve a half teaspoon of Ginger in hot water and add have tablespoon of natural honey to make it sweet and drink it when it is a bit warm.
Three times a day is enough.
Keep drinking this herbal tea for a few days and see the fantastic result of that.
I always try different remedies and if they work for me , I will share them with you.
I hope they can help some of you.

"Dear All
I am hoping someone out there can help. Brief history female ages 54 take blood pressure tablet once a day and have a hiatal hernia for years last camera down to check it was in May of this year. I take anti acid tablets when I have a flare up of indigestion.
For the last 2 months I have had a fist like feeling in the middle of my abdomen at the bottom of my breast bone  my GP has put me on some strong anti acid tablets as he thought it was the hernia, this has made no difference at all. I have a lot of wind both ends and it is feeling like cramping pains here there and everywhere . In my sides under my ribs but nothing in my lower stomach. It moves around all the time. Sometimes a get a sharp stabbing pain in my right side around my ribs. My GP has not suggested IBS but could this be the case.
I have had a CT scan on Tuesday because the medication is not working. I don't feel sick i never have much of an appetite anyway so nothing different there. No weight loss GP checked that. I normally go to the toilet first thing in the morning nothing changed there. I do sometimes get the feeling I have to go immediately though.   I am taking gaviscon   all the time.
I was told my CT scan results would be back at the GP by Tuesday unless something urgent showed up. They are not back today.
Anyone out there got any ideas. At this time of typing I have a nagging pain in my right side which feels like a muscle spasm , a tightening and releasing and a dull ache. The fist feeling is there all the time  .

"Hi i am suspected to have IBS C, i have had the issue for around 6 years now. From what i have read i don't have the severe symptoms that others seem to have, but my symptoms are bad enough that they can cause me to be in a lot of pain occasionally and disrupt everything i do. 
I have tried most of the generic recommendations in terms of supplements, removal of things like caffiene, tea, fizzy drinks and processed food from the diet. My diet has always been well balanced and for the past five months i have only really eaten Spinach, Brown rice, Sweet potato, Quinoa and oats as the main parts of my meals whilst excluding almost completely wheat, glutten and milk.

I generally eat small meals 3 a day sometimes with a small snack, drink enough fluids etc. i'm working on eating slower and reducing stress, which i tend to get 
My main symptoms 
constipation/hard impacted stools
excessive bloating after meals
bloating after not eating for roughly 5 hours
occasionally stomach cramps 
incomplete emptying of bowels 
I am currently looking to experiment with bringing back wheat, glutten and diary foods back into my diet and using a very high potency probiotic. I am also considering getting a comprehensive stool test done, and a breath test to check for intolerances but i am not sure about these options. 
I am looking for someone who has similar symptoms to me and has experienced success with a method of some kind any recommendations would also be really appreciated.

"Hello I have posted here before and various other groups.  I am 70 years old and female.  I was diagnosed with IBS around 7 years ago with a tendency to IBS C.  I only had mild flare ups and was mostly ok although my long standing anxiety did not help.  The last 18 months or so have been very stressful and my anxiety has been bad (I am now having some counselling but early days).  In April of this year following a long bout of constipation and blood in stool I had a colonoscopy.  Thankfully nothing sinister found just one polyp which turned out to be benign and a diagnosis of small internal hemmeroids and multiple diverticular down left side of bowel from transverse colon to sigmoid colon.  The surgeon said the bleeding would have been from either but could not say which.  Fast forward to the last couple of months.  I also have arthritis in spine and knees so used to some pain but started getting awful upper/mid back pain and chest pain which after an examination by gp was told it was tight muscles etc probably from my anxiety.  Well although the back and chest is not so sore I have still have this awful back pain which seems to come on with walking bending etc.  Here is the things I do not understand.  The pain in the back seem to coincide with stomach bloating and burping and sometimes feels like roof of mouth and back of throat is lumpy.  The back pain does seem to be related to the digestion.  I have no heartburn.  Incidentally I thought a couple of years ago that I might have silent reflux.  Most of the symptoms had improved by the time I got seen at the hospital and after a throat scope was told everything ok but was given advice on voice care as I sing in a choir and given a diagnosis of perennial rhinitis.  Unfortunately I can't take the treatment for it as it causes my eye pressures to go up and I already have glaucoma.  Going back to the symptoms they don't really bother me at night although I do wake early.  They seem to come on mid/late morning and last until after my evening meal which is most odd.  My bowels r fine I go once a day easily in the morning as I take fibrogel/membervine drink before breakfast.  My gp gave me ranatidine as I can't take PPI's.  She has sent me for an upper endoscopy  although I have asked to have a consultation with the gastro doctor before I have it done.  I want to make sure it is really necessary.  I wondered could it be an ulcer or gallstones (gp thinks not).  Just had complete annual blood tests and all ok.  I did go to and A and E about 3 weeks ago as I had awful bowel spasm on the left hand side which usually go but this time it lasted hours.  I was worried it might be the start of a diverticular infection.  They too took blood tests all ok and gave me buscopan which worked and sent me home saying probably just IBS but return if the pain gets worse.  It eased off over a few days.  I also wonder could this be anything to do with anxiety it is hard to believe it could but I have read you can get quite severe physical symptoms with anxiety. It is so frustrating not knowing what pain is caused by what.  I am finding life difficult but am trying to still go out and about when really all I would like to do is curl up with a hot water bottle.  Sorry to have gone on and on.  Hope some one can identify with any of this.  I go to see the gastro doctor on Wednesday.

"I'm just going to write my entire experience with what I suspect is IBS paired with extreme anxiety down here and see what everyone else thinks of it. In late July, the 21st to be exact (I remember because it was my mom's birthday), I went to the hospital because of a week long bout of constipation. I didn't pass a single stool that entire week. I just physically could not do it. I was given some x-rays and prescribed a bowel prep laxative that I took later that day. To make it short, it was an extremely arduous 9-hour long process that drained me physically, mentally, and emotionally. I remember crying and snuggling into my mom's bed that night because I was just so miserable. 
The following morning I woke up feeling sluggish, nauseated, and full in the belly. It felt like something was swimming around in me, like contractions but they weren't painful. I went to the hospital again three days later and got more x-rays, and the doctor told me I was still full. He told me to take magnesium citrate. That was also an unbearable ordeal but not so unbearable as the first treatment. That didn't seem to work either. So, I visited my normal doctor and got yet another x-ray, where they showed me the scans personally and determined I was not full as the hospital doctor said, but I did have a lot of gas. I had a massive panic attack when I got home from that appointment, as I'm terrified of x-rays and I'd had a lot done. I was inconsolable for a week after that.
Then, I had another bout of constipation. I was so drained and exhausted that I just went to my normal doctor again. She told me that MiraLax would probably work best, and it did. I cleared out in just under two days and I felt pretty good for a little while. I also finally calmed down about my x-rays, and convinced myself that it wasn't that bad.
But then, it got worse. I started having regular cramps, and bouts of chest pain and an immovable lump in my throat. I started getting dizzy, I got more and more frequent headaches, and I started worrying about each and every medical condition on the planet. To date, I've self-diagnosed multiple types of cancer, a brain tumor, an ulcer, a prolapsed colon, gangrene, heart failure, appendicitis, and many more. This worrying seems to have really set off my symptoms as they seem to be bothering me more these days.
Now, four months later, I sit here worried to go to sleep because I'm legitimately afraid I will not wake up. The idea of sleeping puts a dark pit in my stomach and it's been like this for a long time. It feels like there's a heavy weight in my stomach, and sometimes I'll get a stabbing pain right in the center, which I have Googled (against everyone's wishes) and have convinced myself is something that's going to kill me, because all terrible diseases seem to start with pain behind the navel. 
My digestive symptoms worsen my anxiety, and my worsening anxiety makes my digestive symptoms worse, and it's just a big horrible cycle that I just can't break no matter how hard I try. I can't concentrate on anything anymore, I have regular panic attacks because of all the x-rays I've gotten in my chest and abdominal region, I get tension headaches sometimes multiple times per day, and I'm so convinced I'm going to die that when I make plans I think to myself, ""if I'm still alive to be there."" I sincerely don't know what to do and I need help but I don't know where to start. 
Has anybody else had an experience similar to mine?

"Hi
So to cut a long story short I have recently had a bout of gastritis after taking naproxen for a shoulder complaint. I only took 2 tablets but it was enough to cause damage to my stomach lining. Anyway, this has triggered anxiety which is the worst thing I have ever dealt with in my life. I have been struggling with it now for 3 weeks and have lost a lot of weight. Anyway, my doctors believe that I now have IBS as my stomach should of technically healed by now but I was still experiencing tummy issues and loose bowels. I have been prescribed mebeverine to help with this and it seems to have helped my tummy to calm down abit. I have had to do a stool sample and am waiting results. What I’m wondering is. Has anyone else ever been on this medication before. How long should I take it? ( until the symptoms go? ) or ( until I’ve finished the whole prescription? ) is it normal to feel a little sick between taking them? Or do you think that is just another symptom of my anxiety. Also if anyone has any tips on the type of diet I should be following now that’ll be great. I have no appetite anyway, but think it’s important that I get back to eating normal again soon. Many thanks

"Hi all,
I'm at a bit of a loss of what to do and wondered if anyone has been in a similar situation before/can offer advice on my current situation. This post will be pretty long, so THANK YOU if you take the time to read it - I really appreciate it!
Over 12 weeks ago now, I started having reoccurring episodes of getting sick. It would usually start with a mild headache, slight nausea and heartburn, before progressing to severe nausea (sometimes vomiting) and diarrhoea. These episodes would last for around half an hour to an hour and then I'd pretty much go back to 'normal' and be able to eat again. I put this down to IBS-type symptoms and didn't worry too much at first.
However, as the weeks went by, these episodes would become more and more frequent, last longer and be more severe. Eventually, about 6 weeks ago, I got to the point where I was ill every couple of days and had to keep leaving work early. I was gradually losing my appetite and getting ill off food.
I went to the doctors numerous times up until I got severely ill and they suspected an inflammatory bowel disorder. I was put on the waiting list for a colonoscopy and endoscopy.
about 5 weeks ago, I got very sick. I was waking up at 5am each morning with severe diarrhoea, unbearable nausea and/or vomiting and a gripping/burning pain in the lower right of my belly. One morning, the diarrhoea was black and tar-like as if it had blood in it. The diarrhoea and feeling in my belly was unbearable. At my worst,
I even had diarrhoea on the sofa and didn't make it to the bathroom. I completely lost my appetite to the point of where I could only eat a small pot of jelly a day or suck on an ice lolly. I had a temperature, was sweating, couldn't stop shaking, couldn't stop urinating and had horrible burning in my right hip and lower back.
It got so bad that I went to A&E multiple times and on the worst day, ended up calling an ambulance. After blood tests, physical examinations, urine tests etc., they eventually admitted me after I came in the ambulance.
I was in hospital for 6 days in the end. They did stool tests and more blood tests, but nothing was coming up. On the 2nd or 3rd day, I experienced excruciating 'pain' in the lower right of my belly... I felt like something was going to explode. After a couple of hours of pain, I felt a strange 'pop' sensation and heat radiated throughout the lower right of my belly and my back. It was the strangest sensation I've ever felt... it felt like sunburn on the inside of my body. I explained this to a doctor and they got me in for a CT scan 2 days later. All that showed up was a small cyst on my right ovary, but they said the scan was very shaky from me moving about too much (I was in too much discomfort).
After that 'pop' happened, I very slowly and gradually started to be able to eat a bit more. I'd lost 9kg in total throughout this illness. As I was admitted, they moved my colonoscopy and endoscopy dates forward and I had them performed on my second to last day. Everything, including these tests, came back normal.
After 6 days, I was discharged with a 'suspected' diagnosis of an ovarian cyst and spent a further 6 days or so at home being very ill still. However, it wasn't as bad as before that 'pop' happened. Last Wednesday, I woke up feeling much better and started to eat meals again. It was the best feeling. I was 'well' again for just under a week, with the occasional bout of illness and feeling pretty weak/tired throughout the day. Despite my improvement, I'd already made the decision to go private and proceeded with my appointments. The consultant didn't suspect my experience was down to an ovarian cyst and said these cysts would never cause diarrhoea. However, she booked an ultrasound appointment in for me to be on the safe side.
A few days ago, I started to get ill again. Not to the same level as before, but still with the horrible diarrhoea/nausea in the mornings and gripping/burning feeling in my lower right. I attempted to go back to work for 2 days but I just couldn't cope. I've been off for a month now and have been told not to come back until I'm better.
I had my ultrasound scan yesterday and all it showed was a small cyst again, but not anything that would be suspected to be making me ill. The technician asked me if I'd had my appendix checked after hearing my symptoms, but I've had blood tests and scans and nothing has shown up. I left the appointment crying at a complete loss of what to do. I have a consultation Saturday but these appointments are costing a fortune and I'm not getting enough income with being off work.
I'm really starting to think it may be my appendix... I was leaning more towards the ovarian cyst issue before, but now I'm not so sure. It feels like something is swollen and rotten inside of me... I don't even know how best to describe it. I'm desperate to get better and I'm at the point where I'll do anything. Does anyone have any advice on the best steps for me to take? Has anyone been through a similar experience?
Thanks for reading!

"Here's my story. I'm a 37 year old male. I've never really had stomach issues my entire life and then earlier this year around March 1 I woke up in with horrible stomach pains after a big meal the night before. My abdominal pain is usually on my lower right side. I had a CT scan which came back fine but showed I had a lot of poop stuck in me. I cleared that out with medicine and went on living my life with on and off stomach pains.
About a month ago the pains got really bad again and I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Everything came back normal except my intentness were a bit inflamed possibly from gastritis. This rules out Crones, Colitis and Cancer. After I cleared out my system with the prep kit from the colonoscopy, I felt like my great old self again for about a week. I has also lost about 8 pounds though. Now I gained the weight back and the pains are slowly coming back and I've has diarrhea for a couple of days.
My Gastro doctor wants me to get an abdominal MRI with contrast and some blood and stool tests to rule out other things but he suspects IBS. He gave me IBGuard and Colon probiotics but I'm not sure they do anything. I am going to try the FODMAP diet that everyone on here says seems to help. Any tips for my particular situation? I'd love to have my old pain free life back again at some point. This really wears you down. Stress does seem to trigger and make it worse. It's nice to see that I'm not alone in dealing with this. Thank you.

"Hello, 
I was diagnosed with IBS a few years ago and it effects me everyday. I always have bloating and always have loose BM's. The main thing I'm concerned about is whether my IBS is causing panic attacks or vice Versa... I never thought I was having panic attacks and just assumed it was abnormal ibs attack. I get the stomach cramps, diarrhea and then I sweat, uncontrollably shake, feel short of breath and this all lasts about 3 hours (mainly at night)- I take a couple Imodium and a hot water bottle and wait for it to finish- this then leaves me feeling really weak. 
I just assumed this was normal but a friend whitnessed me having one recently and said she thinks I have panic attacks. Whenever I'm in a restaurant and the thought of ordering food it gives me an 'attack' which I now think is a panic attack... my graduation was awful because I spent the whole day on the toilet. My dads wedding I had diarrhea- it's as if my body thinks I should be nervous so it sends me into this viscious cycle. I'm getting married in a year and a half and the idea of having diarrhea or an 'attack' is freaking me out to the max. Can't get excited about my wedding because I just keep picturing myself feeling nauseous, panicking about food and having diarrhea and having no where to go (we're staying at another hotel so don't have a room to go to). I feel like this is completely ruining my life- I feel like if I get on top of the anxiety and whatever is bringing on the panic attack then I can get on top of my ibs. Is this something my doctor can help me with? 
Any help would be really appreciated Thankyou

"First off I'm a 21 year old male that's pretty healthy and I weigh 130 pounds. I have had anxiety for a few years and always stressed. I've been having abdominal pains, excessive gas literally all day, constipation with pencil thin stools and flat stools. I believe I have an internal hemorrhoid as well since it I only seem to fill it when I sit on the toilet. I tried using hemorrhoid suppositories and it gave me horrible stomach cramps and made me have a small BM within minutes of using it. I feel like all my symptoms lead to colon cancer or something more serious but With me being 21 I feel that's it's almost impossible. I've been on miralax the past couple weeks since I deal with constipation but the only time I have BM's it's just small flat pieces or pencil thin. I don't know if that's because of the miralax or something is blocking my BM's such as hemorrhoids. I haven't noticed any blood in my stools at all as I literally inspect every BM that I have because I can't stop thinking about it. The constipation, constant gas, abdominal pains, hemorrhoids and everything else is just driving me crazy. I've tried eating healthier and nothing seems to help. I thought about stopping the miralax to see if I can have normal BM's but then I'm worried about getting really constipated. I had a CT scan about a year ago, blood work, abdominal x-ray, and urine tests about 2 months ago. Someone just help me figure out what could be going on please.

"hi everyone,
After suffering from an h pylori infection I have had extreme bloating and pain after every meal, as well as breathing problems when moving around, for the past year. I’ve had a gastroscopy since and I’m now clear of ulcers and gastritis.
The doctors keep trying to put me on PPIs (speculating that acid is causing the breathing problems - despite the fact I’m not getting heartburn or anything) despite me telling them it doesn’t help and, in fact, has been making the bloating worse. I went to a private nutrionist who speculated that my stomach has still not recovered from the infection and is not producing enough acid (which apparently can also cause reflux). He gave me some stomach mucosa supplement stuff to try for a while. I did. The pain has decreased but the breathing and bloating are the same.
As an experiment, I did the at home low acid test with baking soda. It seems to point to the nutritionist’s theory, which goes against what the doctors said. I’m trying some hcl supplements to see if it helps. I’m taking some now, but I’ve not seen any positive or negetative changes.
Does anyone have any experience using them. How long should it take to notice a difference? Any general advice?

I have read various websites about what can help the pain but many of them are either unrealistic (cutting out 101 amounts of foods) or to avoid foods that i have eaten and do not make the pain any worse.
Does anyone else suffering with the condition have any pointers or tips to make the pain better?

"Hi all
I'm going to cut a very long story short here as I doubt nobody would have the time to read it!!
I have already been to see my GP on 5 separate occasions over the last 5 years in relation to the bloating, belching and constipation that I have been having since 2012.
I have already had many tests including colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, certain blood tests, stool test for fecal calprotectin and elastase, h.pylori, and various diets including low fodmap & candida, but I am still no further towards understanding the reason for these ongoing symptoms which are getting worse.
I have been trying to self diagnose for the past year or so, because I found that I was getting nowhere through my GP, and I got frustrated. 
I've decided I'm going to pay to get a comprehensive digestive stool analysis test done to try to find out whats really going on.
Has anybody had one of these, and did it help highlight any problems which led to a solution ? who did it ? who interpreted the results for you and did anybody suggest actions based on them ?
I have seen a place called Genova Diagnostics which you can order them from, and wondered if this is a suitable supplier (i'm in the UK).
Thanks

"Hi, was diagnosed with bile acid malabsorption currently taking questran which has stopped the 12 toilet trips a day and poop is now brown not yellow ! I had my gallbladder removed prior to diagnosis so was told my right hand side pain is PROBABLY adhesions. 
I am getting absoloutely unbearable pain in my stomach I can only describe it as like a hunger mixed in with someone squishing all my stomach downwards. I can't stand up straight when this happens. 
I was told due to diagnosis of bile acid malabsorption you always have ibs aswell due to stress and anxiety (haven't left house in 4 years except hospital appointments so anxiety is bad) but buscopan doesn't really do a lot for the pain, 
Was diagnosed with angiodema and uticaria from possibly food allergy but they refused food allergy tests. 
Had colonoscopies reveal adenomas and abnormalities not abnormal enough to say chrons. 
Blood when I'm going to the toilet followed sometimes by an intense burning like a knife has gone up my bowel and stabbed me in the stomach. 
When I'm going to the toilet I have huge yellow balls of mucus and I mean huge as in 5-6cm large at least. 
Asking due to my chrons testing (apart from calprotectin, needing to do a sample) and the GI said chrons if I have it is blatantly in my stomach or small bowel and a diagnosis of BAM is hand in hand with chrons AND ibs. 
I also create no vitamin D so take monthly pills, not sure if relevant but periods for me are HELL completely unbearable leave me bedridden until it's stopped. They are more painful than my gallbladder removal. 
Thanks for any advice,

"Hi there.
It all started 2 months ago with what i thought it was a stomach bug..but after three weeks i went to to gp and she said it might be IBS. My symptoms at the moment were..nausea, absominal discomfort like period cramps and mucous in stools. I dont have diarrhea neither constipation. She ran blood tests and everything was fine. But i seem to be the same or even worse.. i stil suffer from nausea (specially after opening bowels) stil with period cramps like. And now i have this very annoying and discomforting hip pain and very tired and moody all the time. And i havent had my period this month. Is this all normall for IBS? Missing periods? This is weird cos i am very regular and also annoying cos i am planning on having a second child and not possible without my period obviously.
I would appreciate any suggestions or knowing if this is normal for IBS or maybe something else is going on.
Thank you for your time.

"Hey, I'm pretty new to this IBS thing. I'm still not 100% certain that I have it as I have not yet ruled everything else out, so I was wondering how people who have it feel their pain and discomfort. For me, sometimes it's more in the stomach area, and other times it's in the abdominal region, or the back on very rare occasions. Does anybody else sort of switch back and forth between main focuses of pain/discomfort?

"I know, it sounds weird, but it's been happening for a while now. A month or so ago, I had a tooth filled at my dentist's office. I was reclined on the chair at a slight backwards incline, so I was upside down and leaned back just a bit. While I was laying there, I started feeling myself kind of lurch upwards at the stomach area. This happened at least five times during the procedure. It wasn't painful, and it wasn't pronounced enough to cause problems for the dentists, but it was definitely annoying. Afterwards there was some pain, but I'm used to that since I have IBS-type symptoms.
I noticed it again last night and just now. When I lay down is usually when it happens, and it's always when I'm on my back. It still doesn't hurt, and it doesn't seem to be leaving any pain behind when I stand up, but it's annoying and definitely unsettling and if it keeps up I'll start panicking again and lord knows I don't need that. As it is I still can't stop thinking about it and waiting for it to happen again so my ability to concentrate is significantly impaired.
Does anybody else have this? Is it another symptom of IBS? And, is there any way to calm them (and myself) down?

"I was diagnosed with functional IBS three years ago now but...
I am at the end of my rope.
I'm going through something right now which no one seems to have any idea what it is...
It's been the third week now of an upset stomach.
I got  Diarreah frequently in the beginning, this past week it's only been slushy and runny when I go to the toilet which is usually when I get up in the morning.
I feel nauseous all the time. My poo is a yellowish colour, not pale but like bright yellow mostly.
I have lost weight because I've literally been eating clear soups and toast for three weeks, and drinking water, that's it.
My stomach just feels sore and raw from my neck to my anus.
I've had colonoscopies and an endoscopy about two years ago. they came back negative apart from I have a small hiatus hernia.
They came to the conclusion it was IBS, but I am doubting this.
I cannot believe a flare could go on constantly for three weeks and make me feel so ill like this.
I'm weak because I haven't eaten anything of any substance, and when I have tried it's given me worse Diarreah. I'm scared to eat anything at the moment.
I have been off of work for three weeks now and do not know when I am going back as I am unable to work in my job with diarreah.
I honestly feel so depressed with this, I cannot make any plans for the future whilst everyone else is just going on with their life. I'm so sad. I feel so ill. I don't know what to do anymore.

"Hey guys if anyone has any ideas to what’s wrong that could help that would be excellent. Ok, I got gastritis from some ibuprofen last year and was put on ppi’s. During the ppi treatment I noticed my stool wasn’t normal so I stopped the ppi’s. Instead of getting better slowly over this past year it kept getting worse starting from Nausea after taking any supplements that progressed to really bad bloating no matter what I eat, and now to I lost 35 pounds and no matter what I eat can’t gain any weight. No matter what I do to my diet the bloating is permentent. I’ve never had a digestive issue in my life before those ppi’s. I wake up bloated and by the end of the day the more I eat the worse it gets, im not sure what those ppi’s did but it definently started this. If anyone has any ideas I would greatly appreciate it.

"My doctor has recommend Constella and gave me several samples.  I found the higher dose is too much,  and am considering taking the lesser dosage.  
This is a a fairly new drug in Canada, only having been approved in the last couple of years, but has been available in the United States for a longer time.  Pharmaceutical companies are handing out these samples to family practitioners to distribute as 'an easy laxative'  Easy?  NOT FOR ME - but it is a last resort.
I've been told that your body 'gets used to it', but am sceptical of that.  I take it when my regular laxatives don't work (periodically).  The continual cycle of constipation and the opposite  are a continual source of stress.

"Hello,
Apparently strange but beneficial technique, I've noticed recently in my case about severe bloating that I really suffer from is breathing techniques,
I do regular exercise -pilates and Yoga- and I thought why still I can't get rid of bloating, I know there are many like me out there,and we are looking for a solution finally!
I'm not certain if -learning deep breathing techniques- may work for everyone!
But,
In my case which was really annoying bloating and gas in my intestines, it worked to some extent.
If you are also interested, for a start, give it a shot for a week or so and see hopefully the changes in the amount and the times of having gas...
?Something you should do is at the time of each bloating not let your gas get free from your abs instead keep it and start breathing deeply from you abs,
Put the palm of ur hand on your abs and make sure you are inhaling deeply to ur abs and not CHEST...
By practising afew times you will learn it very easily.
?Sit normally, like in yoga position,Try to inhale from nose and keep your breath for 5 seconds and exhale it from mouth...just concentrate on ur breath , listen to it, and keep this process when you feel bloating,
-the thing is, by this action, the blood in the walls of ur intestine will suck the trapped gas in that and direct it to lungs- and you exhale it through ur mouth.
Repeat this function conciously -whenever you feel gas in 'your abs' , do it as much as you can until you will notice the gas in your intestines disappear.
Each time you have gas and feel bloating do not let it be removed,
Just do this technique,
For me, gradually, I can see some subtle changes...
P.S. remember any exercise from pilates to even martial arts which needs deeper and longer breathing can teach you how to concentrate on your breath and solve this annoying problem like bloating.
To make your chest capacity more, start with
PlANK exercise-stay on that position for 1 min. and by time increase it up to 2 to 4 min. -search on the internet to find more information.
Hopefully, it works for you if you stick to it regulary for a month or so and do it correctly and share your postive results with others.

"Hi all,
I've already shared a post about my constant bloating and constipation, no solution yet, of course.
However, following that, Just a quick question ,
Since two days ago I've got a terrible flu,let's say bronchitis, which I've been successful to destroy my lungs and sinus infection only by drinking 'ginger power' mixed in boild water, I did both take it and gargel it several times a day during the last two days, the only miraculous medcine which worked amazingly!
Need to mention, I always drink water , but in that two days I drank water even more,
-----The weird thing is, my intense bloating that I can't get rid of it by any sorta healthy diet, suddenly has disappeared for the last two days,
I thought, at first, its because of ginger but then since today that my flu got a little better my bloating is back, bear in mind , I'm still taking that home-made medicine .....
Im wondering if that terrible, virus-Flu can stooop bloating or what????
I'm confused!!
Can any one of you see any reasonable connection between such terrible flu and temporary bloating-stop?!
How it's possible!

I've experienced the following discomfort for the past few years with varying degrees of severity but it's always there. I've had blood tests (although a while ago so perhaps this needs revisiting) that didn't flag anything apart from slightly low iron and an endoscopy that didn't show anything either. 
The discomfort is in my left side only and sits in line with/under my left ribcage. The area it covers is quite broad but it's only my left side and it's not a concentrated pain. I can feel it on my left on the front, side and on the back - almost like it wraps around that side. There is often a stabbing pain similar to the stitch pain you can get when you go for a run but it's not something that would stop me moving, it's a duller pain than that. The constant feeling is more of a tenderness that is really uncomfortable and often feels full up and like theres stuff sloshing around inside - the same as the feeling you get when you drink too much water in one go.
I often feel the discomfort more if I'm full up and can often feel very nauseous but I'm never sick, but it doesn't tend to be a particular food that sets it off. If i lay on my back and tap on my left side, it can sound very hollow. If I drink big gulps of water, it's like I can feel it go down my left side and often if I'm hungry my left side gurgles more than the rest of my stomach. It is also always worse if I lay on my right side - this feels like my left side is sloshing around all over the place.
This flares up regularly and even when it's not flared up I can still very much feel tenderness in the are of sensitivity. When I feel it flare up, I can often feel it more if I take a big breath in too. Sitting with a hot water bottle sometimes helps, especially when I feel like my stomach needs to do what I can only describe as a big gurgle.
Often if I eat a very big meal, or eat out I sometimes get very bloated and gassy which can be fairly painful. this exaggerates the discomfort on my left and can also be helped by passing wind or having heat on it such as a hot water bottle.
If i push down on my left side front it is very tender and sore. I can also feel tenderness on my back if I poke around at the bottom of my ribcage.
I don't get diarrhoea, although my bowel movements aren't always the same. sometimes quite soft and other times I can go a few days without going to the toilet. 
The thing that makes me question whether it's bowel related or not is that sometimes when I urinate I feel a wave of pain over my left side where the discomfort is.
I also suffer from lower back pain but I don't know if this is related or a separate issue.
I am so fed up of feeling this way, it's making me so anxious and did the awful thing of googling my symptoms which put the fear of god into me as there's just so much out there and you always pick up on the worst case. 
I hope someone out there can shed some light, or has shared similar problems.

"Having diarrhea on weekly or bi weekly basis for about two half months , when I first got it I was passing stalls that where all shades of brown from pale to medium brown. Colour has now levelled off to a mediumish brown . However I get diarrhea which is watery explosive but will only be once or possibly twice, worst ways 3 times in that day. However I have noticed on days that I have normal stools I sometimes feel that I haven't completely cleared my bowels, if I sit there and persist this will either result in soft stools or diarrhea if anything else comes out. On some days I have a lot of wind , upstairs , downstairs and stomach .
I've had full blood tests twice with nothing showing up, had several stool tests, only one which showed anything out of ordinary was faecal Calprotectin which shows intestinal inflammation which was elevated . Even an abdominal ultra sound showed nothing. My GP has referred me to a GI specialists but my appointment is not till mid January. My GP does not seem worried , that doesn't count for me , I'm scared.
Other symptoms I have are random abdominal and lower chest pains front and back, and a slightly bitter taste in mouth some days. Initially I lost some weight and appetite (some of which was down to anxiety ) however my appetite is good now and I've put back on some of lost weight. I don't tend to pass blood, however on the odd occasion i have I think was down to aggravated haemorrhoids (according to doctor).

"Something I've noticed fairly recently (perhaps as I've been checking my stools more rigorously) is that I sometimes food passes through me extremely quickly.
A while back I noticed that chunks of mushroom and corn would appear in my morning stool after eating them the night before (approx. 10-12 hours) which, I suppose, isn't too bad, but recently I've noticed some food items, such as salad leaves and skin from beans/lentils) have appeared as quickly as 2-3 hours after eating them. 
I know undigested food in stool is a common thing in all people (especially vegetables) but I'm a bit concerned about the  - 6 hour transit time as that seems pretty quick.

"I am a 21 year old female and have been experiencing (mostly) bright red blood in my poo for the past couple of months. At first it didn’t happen very often, but has gradually got worse so I bleed with nearly every bowel movement now. Sometimes I feel like I need to rush to the toilet, only to release gas and bloody mucus. This happens a lot. I also get very bloated sometimes, and have stomach pain. Just the other day I got the flu, and that has caused me to get chronic diarrhoea with blood. Normally I won’t go to the toilet more than 3 times a day at most, but now I’ve got the flu I am going at least 10 times a day. 
Last year I had digestive issues and was told I probably had IBS. At that point I had no bleeding, but now I am getting very worried as it is happening with every bowel movement. 
Any ideas on what the issue could be? Also what foods should I maybe avoid eating?

"At the end of July, I had a fit of severe constipation, excess gas, a 'swimming' feeling in my guts, and nausea. It lasted about a week or two. During that time I was put on aggressive laxatives, including GoLytely. Just typing that name out makes me flinch-I sat on the toilet for upwards of nine hours that day and I got nothing. After that I was given Magnesium Citrate, which also made my life hell for no reason. Eventually, the constipation passed on its own and I was recommended MiraLax for any future fits. 
The doctors at the hospital tested my blood, my urine, they did x-rays and pressed around and found nothing. (The doctor during that session severely overtreated me, so when he said he thought it was possibly a stomach ulcer, I didn't entirely believe him. We'll get back to that.)
After that my symptoms kinda winded down, but there was always some persistent discomfort. I can't quite recall exactly what went down, but basically the symptoms kept changing every week or so. I had bad bloating, the occasional shifting, excess gas from both ends, and just an overall feeling of unease. I was losing sleep every night because of the awful contractions in my guts as well as the awful acid reflux that burned at my throat whenever I laid down.
This is where I should mention my severe and often debilitating anxiety I've had my entire life. This all was made a thousand times more stressful due to it, and I found myself worrying about an early death. At eighteen years old, I was lying awake at night crying my eyes out wondering if I was going to see tomorrow. I looked up the symptoms of stomach ulcers and had a panic attack when they matched, but I didn't follow the prescription due to my inability to see a GI for multiple stupid reasons. I noticed one of the causes of stomach ulcers is NSAID pain reliever usage, namely Ibuprofen. I've used Ibuprofen quite a bit in my life due to my constant migraines, so certainly that could be a cause? Who knows.
As of now, the shifting in my guts only happens when I eat whole wheat. Within minutes it gets so awful I feel like stabbing my stomach out to make it stop. There's a persistent tight feeling in the left side of my abdomen that flares up and simmers down at random, the occasional stretch or mild stabbing pain in the same area, and I get stomach cramps pretty often. I pass gas through both sides a lot throughout the day, and my stools are loose and frankly really gross. Sometimes, if my abdominal pain is flared, it hurts to try and pass stools as if something is on the verge of bursting. Additionally, it sometimes feels full like it would be if I'd drank a small glass of water. It's extremely unpleasant and does absolutely nothing to soothe my anxiety. It's bothering me pretty badly right now but I ate some over-seasoned chicken a couple hours ago, so I'm wondering if it really is just a flare up.
My bathroom habits are really getting in the way of my social life. I can never tell when I'm going to need to sit on the toilet for thirty minutes, and the last time I was with a friend I ruined it by making her stop the bus early on so I could find a bathroom. I try to only eat foods with lots of fiber once or twice a week so I don't get overloaded.
I have a case of minor, untreated scoliosis that I suspect may be causing my back pain whenever I stand idle or sit. I find that my right side presses down a little more than my left whenever I sit straight up. I'm not sure if this could contribute but I felt like it was good information.
My biggest question is, does this sound familiar to anyone who's actually diagnosed with IBS? I've done the press test multiple times so I think I can rule out appendicitis, though when I press too far on any area it doesn't feel all that pleasant. I'm scheduled to see a doctor soon so I'm hoping to get some answers, but for now, is there anyone else who struggles with these symptoms? I'm sick of jumping the gun and convincing myself I'm going to die before I'm twenty.

"Hi, I’m a 16 year old female and I was diagnosed recently with ibs. I had been going through the diarrhea phase of it for a very long time, whenever I had a bm it was normal or it was dirrahea. Back in July I had to go to the hospital because I wasn’t able to have a bm for over a week. When I followed up with my doctor she did some imaging but then after told me I had ibs. I’m still in the constipation phase, I’m having bowel movements most days, but some days it’s very hard to go or I’m unable to go.

"I have had this problem before but i had pretty much solved it through very strict eating.
I eat potatoes sweet potatoes peas kale chard coconut oil honey brown sugar all poultry and fish. Fruit really messes with me so i dont touch it. Lots of food bothers me.
Anyways ive been pretty much totally ok for 1.5 years now when all of a sudden it came back. The only thing i can think of is i got busy and was eating less before it started. Ive had this inability to take a deep satisfying for nearly three weeks and its only getting worse. I saw my doctor who said it was my costocondhritis or anxiety. She was sure its anxiety but i am sure it isnt. Its the damn gas!
Right now i am only eating small small amounts of kale potatoes and poultry. I made a soup and try to drink that when i have no appetite. Ive had diarrhea which is rare for me now.
I also have costochondritis but i feel like this inability to breath is related to the terrible trapped gas. Its not coming out the rear its always burps.
Im losing my mind. I feel like total dirt. I dont want to live my life like this but im at a loss as to what to do. I can go on ppis but i have put that off for so long.
Is there any way to fix this? What is going on

"I'm 24 and I've been dealing with serious bowel issues for the past year, and minor bowel issues for ~8 years.
It started with pain when I was ~16, I'd get sharp stabbing pains in my gut/intestines, and occasionally further down in the rectum. This went on pretty steadily for ~6-7 years with no further issues. More recently over the past 1-2 years I've noticed further changes in bowel habits, changes in size, severe constipation/feeling blocked, color, texture. More recently I've noticed the sharp acute pain becoming more localized to the rectum rather than intestines. It's just getting worse and worse, bowel movements are mostly diarrhea or small and floaty and sometimes multiple different colors/shades in one turd. One day I was so backed up I had severe localized pain in the colon area. I'm going to the washroom multiple times per day and passing gas constantly. I seem to also have difficulty/frequency urinating as well, but maybe that's my caffeine habits.
I've yet to actually see definitive signs of bleeding, and certainly nothing regularly, but I'm wondering if I'm just looking for the wrong thing and my doctor is relying to much on my ability to know what to look for. I've mentioned the occasional variance in shades/colors but haven't actually had any tests done so far other than a blood test and urine test for the urinary issues. I don't have any unexplained weight loss yet but I also have a binge eating disorder so... My doc is ~65 years old and seems to be of the opinion that bowel cancer just doesn't happen to young guys, after some research I'm beginning to realize that is nonsense. I meet most of the risk factors, overweight, lack of exercise, typical fast food western diet loaded with sugar, recovering from a couple years of alcoholism, I don't smoke but that's more related to lung cancer anyways. 
I'm not sure what I can do here to convince my doc that bowel cancer is a very real possibility. I seem to have a few too many symptoms for typical ibs, and neither Crohn's nor Colitis seem to match up all that well? I'd really appreciate some info on whether any of this is common with ibs, I know I won't have anything more definitive until I can at least convince my doc to do a sh!t test to check for blood and other cancer related markers. It took me many months to work up to courage to even go over this stuff with my doc/get over the embarrassment, and now that I'm over it I've spent another 6 months or more just waiting on things to get worse to the point where I'm either bleeding, can no longer crap, or I lose significant amounts of weight... That seems to be the only thing the doc is interested in pursuing any further.

"Bit of a sensitive (in both meanings of the word) topic. After being diagnosed with IBS, I got some medication which luckily helped, and I no longer fear going out for longer than a couple of hours anymore.
However, where my stools used to be just very soft/diarrhea-like, they now have 'improved(?)' to a more solid state.
To get to the point, I noticed that going to the toilet took a bit more effort than what I had become used to, and it started hurting just a little bit. Nothing too uncomfortable, just noticeable.
Now I noticed in the shower that there is a lump around my anus. Touching it doesn't hurt at all, I just felt it while washing. Could those be external hemorrhoids that are caused by the fact that my stools are more solid now that the medicine for IBS is working, and that I actually have to 'put in some effort' for lack of a better term?
If they are, will they disappear after a while? I'm going on vacation soon so I wanna be sure they're nothing to worry about before leaving the country for three weeks.
Thanks in advance,
John

"Hi! I'm a 36 year-old male and have had IBS-like symptoms for over 10 years.
Recently it has got worse - my bloating and stomach cramps often wake me up during the night or early in the morning. This is always accompanied by back pain and often with cold-like symptoms (blocked nose, phlegm in throat, fatigue). 
After I get up the pain does usually improve but I feel spaced out / fatigued for most of it. 
My girlfriend gives me a back rub every morning which sometimes helps to relieve symptoms (burping / farting) but I really want a fix as it's making me depressed and anxious.
I've tried going wheat-free, alcohol free, the FODMAP diet, Omeprazole, etc. If anyone has similar symptoms and / or possible remedies  please let me know.  
Thanks in advance...

"It seems pretty hard to find a good answer to this question cause I hardly see it mentioned online. My question is about the true definition of diarrhea. Can you have ibs d if you DONT have soft or watery stools but you have an increase in normal consistency bowel movements? Gotcha example I am currently awaiting diagnosis via colonoscopy but I wonder if my symptoms still have the potential to be ibs if I have increased normal consistency bowel movements. Basically these movements don’t follow much of a linear pattern except that I Switch between irregular periods of increased normal consistency bowel movements that come with a sense of urgency and yet are somehow still solid and even occasionally sorta(not very but the feeling is there) hard to pass and released in a rather normal amount of volume. Then on other days I feel backed up and constipated but I am able to pass solid broken up short logs if I sit on the toilet for a while and strain slightly. Even when this occurs I end up going more frequently but with less volume than the other symptoms mentioned above. I also want to mention that during this phase I experience the feeling of backed up gas that feels stuck in my lower back for a few seconds before I fell it being moved to my rectum. This whole process leads to invcressed gas but the intermittently trapped gas doesn’t cause pain only a kind of mild annoying pressure. Lastly I want to mention that I am 21 years old and only experienced liquid diarrhea after eating relatively spicy foods about 30 miniuted after. I noticed this pattern of liquid stool after spicy foods 5 times in different occasions. Every time it occurs it only forces one liquid bowel movement and then it’s over. The rest of the time the two other patterns mentioned above occur without any remission.

"Hello guys, my name is Nikolay and I'm from Eastern Europe, and I'll try to explain you my problem and hopefully find a solution for it.
I never had any problems with my Stomach, occasional diarrhea and stomach pains weren't common at all, maybe once a month or something, so I was always happy with it and never even paid attention to it.Soon after I turned 14sh, I started to encounter a huge problem with my stomach and my digesting. From that point to my life started to become a huge Roller coaster of emotions and huge level of depression. My whole life started to orbit around my stomach, most of my thoughts were if I was going to get diarrhea or when & how I emptied my bowels. It came to that point that I was too afraid to even go to my highschool which resulted in bad grades, but somehow I overcame that problem and managed to finish my school, had a lot of problems but I could simply cheat with a simple paper from my doctor that I was sick, and they bought it. My social life went totally numb, I rarely socialized outside of my Home, and even on very rare occasions, when I was 'forced'' to go out, I would do my research about the nearest toilets around that place and how much would it take me to take a cab, and ride home in case of an 'emergency''. As I said, this problem ruined all my chances of a stable life, most of my weekends, are watching tv-series and chatting via social medias. When I started going to the college (around 3 years ago), during the first year I had no problems with attending it, I still had diarrhea, but never really cared about it, and my stomach problems were reduced for some extremely peculiar reason, I never cared about it, and my first year went extremely good, so good actually,that I forgot about all those awkward situations I was put during my highschool years, I started to socialize, my life got a lot better etc, you get my point. But at start of my second year at the college, the problems came back for some strange reason, and are still going on (I just started my third year at the college). And everything is bad as it were a simple timetravel to my highschool days, I have severe depression the reason being my constant fear of diarrhea, diarrhea itself, and bloating. I started to eat less, lost a lot of weight and rarely go out, almost never, and even when I go out, I always have to have some backup plan in case my stomach wants to co*kblock me again. I really don't know what to do, its becoming an extreme problem, in a year or two I will become a teacher at some school and I cannot simply cancel my classes and such.It started to mess up with my mental health to that point that even a single bowel movement would be indicated as a diarrhea and my panic attack start to happen. Any insight is HUGELY welcomed, thanks in advance
PS: I never consulted my doctor for some reason

"Hello!
So I have recently (the past week or so) been having more pain in my abdomen than usual. I used to deal with IBS-C, now it seems to be a mix between both constipationa and diarrhea (sorry, we’re getting really personal)
I felt totally fine (minus my usual anxiety stomach pain) until I ate at 6am a couple night ago and for the rest of the day (it lasted maybe 24 hours) I had really bad stomach cramping, and acid reflux. It felt like trapped wind and I was definitely passing gas through both ends. I had a bowel movement and it made me feel better temporarily but then it came back again.
I’m not really sure what to do (as I have this pain again tonight)!or if anybody has any advice, but if you do, that would be very helpful! I’m starting to panic because I have bad health anxiety!

"So for seven years I have had constant diahrea, sickness and unbearable stomach cramps, dealing with all this has obviously made me depressed.
Most doctors and specialists told me I was making it up and you know what after being told that for about 5 years I started to think I was losing it.
They also tried to just fob me off with IBS as they had done all these tests and they kept coming back normal. but I kept pushing that there was something wrong with me.
Well recently I had a test to look for bile acid malabsorption... And guess what it showed up that I have it. And this is the reason for all my horrible symptoms.
They have prescribed me colesevelam and I was just wondering if anyone on here has been prescribed them.. Or if anyone else has bile acid malabsorption
I must say it feels fantastic to know that there is actually something wrong with me.
I hope this is the right place for this post I didn't know where else to post it.
I look forward to hearing from anyone.
Thanks x

"A week ago I was given Mebeverine tablets by my doctor for IBS and so far I am experiencing little, if any, change in my symptoms. My main symptom has been chronic stomach pain, nearly always late evening/early hours of the morning. Perhaps it has helped to make symptoms appear slightly less frequently but certainly in terms of easing the pain there is no change. Am I expecting too much too soon?!
9 times out of 10 my pain is in the middle of the night (not every night thank goodness), and I have to get up for several hours as I can't sleep. This has been going on for a couple of weeks now. Needless to say I am tired and starting to get upset and stressed by it, which I doubt is helping!
I am seeing my doctor again this week but feel almost at my wits end, so any advice about whether Mebeverine needs a little more time to kick in, or whether others were prescribed this and it didn't work and something else was given to them instead would be useful to know.
I stumbled on this site by accident some days ago and like others have said, it is just reassuring to know that it is not just me, and other people know what it is like to have their life disrupted and controlled by IBS.
Thanks for any advice you can offer.

"I've been battling 'IBS' for some time now. 29 yr old male - blood work as recent as end of May came back great. Last year had an upper GI and colonoscopy and everything was normal. Have no reason to believe there's an issue with liver kidneys pancreas etc. 
There are some things I eat and perhaps stress results in a variety of results in the toilet. It doesn't seem to 
Matter if I eat healthy, don't drink, etc. so intermittent which leads to anxiety because I work out religiously and consider myself the picture of health.
It seems like there's always an 'issue' that I deal with the average person doesnt worry about.. that's a whole different issue.
One concern arose this morning - I had a couple of beers on Sunday and had 2 bowel movements Monday which were a little less than desirable. Monday I had some 'bars' with fiber, a 'green cold pressured juice' and a small kale salad. No alcohol.
This morning my stool smelled 'fermented' is the best way I could describe it. Not offensive just an alcohol like quality. 
Anyone else? Anything to be concerned about?

"Hi There, 
Following sooo many tests I have been diagnosed with mild gastritis which was diagnosed via endoscopy and my colonoscopy was clear. I have have had endless bloods taken and also a stool test and they were all clear. Following a large bout of diarrhoea and nausea about 11 weeks ago, of which my GP thought was gastro or food poisoning things have just been different. I feel I have not fully recovered. Just wondering if anyone else bowel movements can be so inconsistent. I went the first 8 weeks with water like diarrhoea only and then finally they thickened up to be harder but have never gone back to my normal. I had a few weeks recently where I thought maybe my IBS was improving as my abdominal pain/discomfort had improved but I still had bad gas and bloating when I ate. Then bam!, about a week and a half ago I started to notice I would eat well (good appetite) and I notice for one day it sat well but I was starting to bloat, but no real discomfort, then the next day no bowel movement and still feel ok discomfort wise, but would still be bloated and have gas. By late arvo on that day, I would start to get stomach aches around my belly button height and below and a burning sensation in my bum as if I need to go but didn't. I would also get a grumbling, groaning sound in my intestines. The belly aches would come and go that arvo/evening and the next morning. During the belly aches time, I noticed when I passed wind they were very warm and fowel smelling. That next morning I would have a real urge for the toilet and today for example I went and my bowel movement was sloppy and mushy but not water like. After I had finished I still had the burning sensation, as if I hadn't finished but I had.  I then ate some breakfast and not long later I had the urge to go again and this time it was more runny 'water' like diarrhoea. After this movement, I felt implied. The burning sensation went and I felt cleaned out. Today I am fairly comfortable, eating well and my belling is a little grumbly, but waiting to see if the same pattern occurs over the past few days. Does anyone experience something similar. My doctor tells me it is IBS, but my anxiety has me worried it is something more, even though I have had a colonoscopy.
I see my gastro doctor again on the 16th of this month, which is my first consult following my colonoscopy and endoscopy. She has consulted with me over the phone though to advise all my biopsies have returned clear and she gave me a report with pictures after my procedure. I am taking nexium for the gastritis/reflux and today I started Vitamin C and multi-vitamins.

"I've never been diagnosed with IBS. I've never had an issue with bowel movements or anything. Recently I was diagnosed with gastritis because of pain under right rib and tenderness. I've had a CBC, a liver and kidney functions test, a hep panel, I asked for my pancreas to be tested (I have anxiety), a d dimer, X-rays of chest and upper back and a urinalysis, all which came back normal. I know it was a bad decision but I wanted Chinese for dinner, so that's what we bought. After eating, chicken lo mein, I started having mild stomach pain and lower abdominal cramping. I went to the bathroom and felt much better after that but it was pretty much watered diarrhea. The super weird thing though was that there was mild burning, sorry TMI. I'm 26 btw. I don't have a very great diet but since the gastritis I've been trying to eat better, tonight was my slip up LOL. Could this be IBS or possibly the gastritis? I know we aren't doctors on this forum but no harm in asking. Thanks!

"Hi all,
I'm looking for peoples' inputs on whether they've experienced the same symptoms as me  and I really only have IBS or if I should head back to the doctor.
Long story short I have IBS and recently moved to Korea so I had access to IBS medication (because Koreans have medicine for everything). I was told to take it for 2 weeks, but a day or two before I was done with my prescribed medication, I had to switch medicines for a gum infection. The gum infection medication came with a stomach medication as I showed them what I was already taking. But in the process of taking the medication for 2 weeks and until now, I feel like my IBS has gotten worse. My digestion seems to be okay, as I can still eat and have an appetite for everything, BUT I physically can't. When I eat too much (which isn't too much), I get EXTREMELY bloated in my lower stomach area. Like I feel like the food is stretching my stomach to its maximum potential and I can't breathe or move around. And it lasts pretty much all day. I'm basically bloated slightly from the moment I wake up and then it just gets worse throughout each meal. + this is a pretty low symptom, but I have upper stomach pain as well. I can't tell if this has to do with my IBS, but it usually hurts most when I'm really full and my bloating is really intense or when I feel like I have trapped gas.
So my top symptoms are extremely heavy CONSTANT bloating with having taken medication that didn't help at all. I feel like these 2 symptoms are pretty unusual for IBS as I've read bloating shouldn't be 24/7 as mine seems to be, and medication should have helped if it was really IBS.
Thank you in advance for any input or answers or advice!!

"Hi so I've made a post before about broken up bms but this is rediculous.
Every time the past week I've been for a bm which is pretty much once every day I would first fart and there is a lot of mucus, today there was a larger amount than normal. Then I will go fairly easily and there is a lot however when I wipe it won't clean. It's very soft and mushy and doesn't seem to form properly. Don't judge me please but I currently have a weird addiction where I clean inside my bum because of my OCD, I've been trying to break the habit but currently that seems impossible to do.
After I have been once I clean inside and there is loads there, the stool has broken up and some is stuck which is what was happening before, however now it's really difficult to pass the rest. And because it's so mushy and there is mucus I'm scared of it leaking out. When I do eventually go I go the exact same as before and it is so big it looks like I've gone for the first time, this normally happens 3-4 times so I spend about 1 hour just pooping it's horrible. And then after that is done and it still won't clean I keep doing little bits at a time until eventually I can wipe.
I don't think I can break my addiction (I am receiving cognitive behavioural therapy) until this is solved or managed because I know for a fact I will not be conftable leaving the toilet knowing there's some stool stuck there.
Please help and don't judge me I really need to improve somehow as in going to be rediculously busy soon due to school exams. I'm 15 btw.
Anyone asking about seeing doctors I've seen a couple people, my GP has ran out of options I saw a pediatrician who dismissed everything I said and just told me to deal with it and now I couldn't see a different pediatrician privately at the same hospital because they don't want their doctors to look bad if they find something. I'm currently waiting on a appointment at a different hospital so currently I'm losing hope of ever getting better and not feeling terrible every day.
Thanks for reading and please help me.

"Hi everyone I’m pretty sure you’ve seen one of my posts a couple of times for e.g. the mucus and blood stuff. But I have been to the doctors 2 times now I’ve had a blood test done and that’s come back normal and no action, and now I’m getting 2 stool tests done on Tuesday. And I am waiting to hear of a doctor. But recently the blood and mucus had calmed down and what I mean by this is I’ve had no constipation and hardly and mucus and I rarely get blood in or on top of my stools just sometimes at least 1-2 every 2-3 weeks really but I’ve had no mucus really just maybe the odd bit. But my stools have been alright I guess for the last 4 days which is good. But I’ve had this new thing that’s popped up it’s like a stabbing pain in my really low left side of my belly basically the top far left above my genitals but it is on my stomach it’s just like 1 stab and then goes but it doesn’t bother me when I’m doing stuff or anything and it doesn’t stay on my mind and I’ve only had this symptom today. I have also been getting a little bit of cramp I guess you could call it at the top of my stomach. 
So could anyone give me any ideas or even something or anything to help me ease my mind. Oh and also I forgot to menstion I’m only a 15 year old boy. And have had no family history off any health issues or problems!

"So I posted in a couple thread about ibs symptoms a while back ago. I had my Gastro appointment last week and am scheduled for a colonoscopy for October 28th. The doctor also wants to do a CBC, a CRP, Liver tests, and a test for Celiac disease(forgot the specific test name). I'm hoping that the only reason the doctor wants a colonoscopy is because of a family history of ulcerative colitis. I also just learned that the cancer my grandpa had years ago(I was really really young) was actually colon cancer. Unfortunately this made my anxiety much worse. Would the family history I mentioned make ibs less likely(I'm 21) or would it be a greater chance for ibd or if I'm very very unlucky colon cancer?

"Hello. I am not sure if I have IBS so I can move this discussion is need be, and apologies in advanced if this gets TMI.
For the past couple months I've been having to defecate constantly. Often, I will wake up with either diarrhea or a large amount of very soft stool. After that I have to go again maybe 5 or more times? They are long and thin stools, somewhat soft. It's not causing me pain but it is really hindering my life. I get anxiety going to work because I've had to leave my post to deal with diarrhea, and I keep turning down opportunities to hang out or sleeping over for the fears of this happening.
I eat a vegan diet. I try to eat healthy but I defiantly eat a lot more sugar than I should be (horrible sweet tooth) Maybe that is the cause of this. 
Any suggestions? It's getting to the point where I am considering to fast on water and not eat for a couple days just to get some relief. My mom thinks its just because I am vegan but I don't think this is normal. Thanks for any tips xx

"Hi,
Ive recently acquired a Pro Biotic (PB) for my IBS.
A lot of the information online is conflicting, some stating its better to take the supplement with meals and some saying 30 mins before and some saying on an empty stomach.
Im just looking to find out what works for other people.
I don't have breakfast as I do 'intermittent fasting', for those of you who don't know, this is a pattern of eating where you have an 8 hour eating window throughout the day, for example '12 - 8'
I drink green tea in the AM, so if I was to consume my PB in the morning or 30 mins before my first meal how long would I have to wait until the effects of the heat of the tea were gone (Apparently heat destroys the beneficial bacteria?)
Its confusing as some sources say the pro biotic should be taken on an empty stomach when acid levels are low, and some sources say it should be taken with food to avoid the destruction of the PB, due to stomach acid - can anyone shed any conclusive evidence on what works here?
From what I've gathered my plan so far is
1) Get up about 6AM and have green tea
2) Take PB around 10/11 (if this is long enough to avod effects of tea?)
3) Have Meal 1 around 12
Im hoping this is enough time for the heat of the tea to be diminished and also long enough to take before my first meal.
Hope someone can help, advice is massively appreciated!

The first time i saw it, it was like a round white egg looking thing stuck in my poo and then like a week later, the other day i saw it again and this time it looked like a round yellow egg. And now today I took this picture of my poop and im guessing this the same thing again. Im not sure what these round egg looking things are and im starting to get very scared as I have read online about parasites and worms. But apart from these round things i haven't noticed anything else in my poop so i doubt its worms. But please reply back if you can and if you know what this is please try an explain to me as im getting really worried and im not sure if i should go to the doctors or not. PLEASE HELP.Thank you.
Sorry for the picture I know its not something you wanna see, but I had to put it up to help you get a better idea of what Im talking about.

"Hi everyone,
so I haven't been officialy diagnosed with IBS, but I've been having stomach problems for almost 4 years now.. mostly pain after eating, bloated A LOT and windy. I also have a huge problem with going to the bathroom, it's very stressing for me and I have a tendency to hold it in. I suffer from constipation very often.
My question though is - can this all be in my head? All my medical results are okay, I don't have any health issues. 
Also, I might have a depression. Lately I have no appetite, I feel very sad and pesimistic. I've been struggling as I am studying abroad and it's been a really hard time for me.
Do you guys think, that if I manage to get out of that mental state (with the help of a therapist) my stomach issues will dissapear?
Love for all of you.

"Hi all,
I've suffered with IBS for over 10 years. It's evolved from IBS c to d. Last year the nausea symptoms really kicked off. I lost a stone as I was vomiting anything I was putting into my stomach. Even water. Having had an endoscopy a few years previous and told it's just IBS and to live with it I was nervous about going back to the doctors. However I did and had the full range of tests; bloods, stools, colonoscopy, gastroscopy, lactose intolerance, bile re-absorption etc etc. my gastroenterologist has officially diagnosed me as IBS d. 
I have all the symptoms, the full array of the Bristol stool chart in one day, constant cramping and pain, constant bloating ---> lots of wind (both ends). All the classics. But the one that get's me the most and leaves me unable to do a single thing is the nausea and vomiting. Sometimes this affects me everyday, sometimes it'll affect me once a week. I was on Domperidome (currently swapped to Ondansetran due to being put on Amitriptyline - for gut reasons (low dosage) - will be going back to it soon. Which is really great, and has helped massively. But I do still suffer.
During a flare up it often starts as cramps in my gut then waves of nausea in my stomach. Which deepen quickly and usually ends in me vomiting. which does help, but obviously you don't want to be vomiting everyday. Whilst this is all happening I develop a temperature, i feel light headed and extremely exhausted. I cannot do anything, I have to lie down/be sick. Which obviously on a daily basis at work is impossible, as is taking time off. If I take a tablet this usually eases after an hour. I will still feel nauseous and unable to eat, exhausted and my stomach is tender, I struggle to walk as each step pulses waves of nausea and my stomach is so clenched and have zero strength. The only thing that helps is sleep, rest and water.   
If this happened once a month I'd be able to cope with it, but when it's almost everyday it's crippling me. I work as a freelancer so taking days off means I don't get paid but also struggling with this means I don't get re-employed because there are physically fit people who are actually capable of completing a working day. 
Just wondering if anyone else suffers this symptom as it seems rarer than the others and if they have any remedies? 
Please note I take mebeverine, paracetamol on a daily basis. Colpermin, Imodium when needed. 
I take probiotics everyday and have done a lot of tests with my diet (fodmap, lactose and gluten) - of course there are triggers but these symptoms go well beyond food as I can eat a banana and throw it up. 
Naturally tiredness and anxiety hugely affect it. 
Any tips and hints would be much appreciated. 
Thank you!

"Hi all,
I posted a few days ago about all my symptoms and got 3 replies from people saying I have classic IBS. With that, I had a peace of mind and was eating well and was not stressed as much, but yesterday was rough for some reason and I've never felt this before (even when I had acid reflux) so I'm wondering if this is just a new symptom of IBS or something else?
I ate a looot for lunch yesterday and was full and bloated for hours. I got home and pooped alot and rested and started to feel hungry so I slowly took the time to make dinner. When I was almost done making dinner, I was feeling kind of nauseous but definitely hungry so I sat down and made myself eat to see if it was because I was so hungry, but just a few bites in and the nausea was really bad so I stopped. I really ate about 4-5 bites and I was super nauseous and when I stood up, I was super bloated. I think the nausea was really bad for about 30 mins and then slowly started to subside over the next hour. I put a heat pack on my stomach later and went to bed basically without eating dinner, but feeling full from gas or bloating. This has never happened to me before, because I used to have really bad acid reflux and nausea, but it never was accompanied by heavy bloating after just 4-5 bites.
Has anyone else not been able to eat before because of nausea from IBS? This episode made me really worried because it was so sudden and intense and I was eating so so well for a good number of days.
Appreciate any input!! Thanks everyone!

"Hi, so about a year ago i was diagnosed with GERDS... (or acid reflux disease) after suffering for about 9 years, in which i now take tablets for. However, in the past 6 months i have noticed that i am now feeling nauseous after eating, normally about 30 minutes after a meal, am constantly tired, thirsty, feel dizzy when standing up and moving around, get out of breath very easily and sometimes get a sinking feeling in my heart/chest. I also, which i have had for longer than six months, suffer from my stomach bloating out like a balloon when i eat or drink anything however small the portion. I do have a history of IBS in my family, however i do not experience symptoms like stomach pain or irregular bowels like others with IBS therefore it has been seen as being unlikely that it is this.
I had an endoscopy a year ago to confirm my GERDS and nothing else was found apart from having a weak muscle at the top of my stomach. I have recently been back and forth to my GP and have had blood and urine tests all of which have come back normal. I am a normal weight, 19 years old, have a good balanced diet and try to exercise at least two times a week, so am completely confused as to why i have all these symptoms. My doctors have no idea what could be wrong with me so i was wondering if anyone could help? Has anyone had the same symptoms and got a diagnosis, i'm fed up of feeling like this and would just like some answers!!!

"I was prescribed Buscopan a few months ago and, as they are working, have been taking them once or twice a day on a regular basis.  However, I'm not sure if they're contributing to a dry eye flare-up and have decided to cut down.
I've read that some people just use them as and when, but don't really understand how this works.  My IBS shows itself in severe cramps after eating, followed by a rush to the toilet.  Buscopan takes 15 minutes to work, so, if I take a tablet when I get the pain I presume it will be too late at that point to do any good.
I'd be interested to hear other's comments on what is the best way to do this.

"After every meal I experience discomfort in my rectal area, and the urge to go. The urge to go is sometimes weak, leaving me with the feeling I need to go but can't quite yet. Other times it's strong enough that I will be able to go. When I do use the toilet my stool is broken up into many pieces leaving me with incomplete evacuation. I often have to strain towards the end of a bowel movement to try and push the last few pieces of stool out, often unsuccessfully. After I'm done having a bowel movement it's not long before the urge to go creeps back in. It's very frustrating feeling like you're done, only to feel like you need to go again shortly after. It's not just a sensation either. Sometimes I need to go several times during the day with more coming out. Sometimes a lot comes out and other times it's only the tiniest little bit. I also experience discomfort and the urge to go during exercise. I often go for walks, and about half way through the urge to go creeps in. The urge is very rarely painful, it's just annoying as hell. I can sort of feel stool sitting there, like a slight pressure. It controls my level of enjoyment in everything I do because it is so hard to ignore.
Do any of you experience this also? Have you found any medication, supplements or a diet that helps with this problem? Thanks.

"Hi there,
I'm a long term anxiety sufferer which over the years has switched between general and health anxiety.
It's for this reason i'm trying to be logical and not immediately panic, but cutting out googling symptoms has left me unsure. Apologies now for the detail but as an IBS forum i'm sure you've heard it all.
It has been suggested by doctors that i could have IBS triggered by my anxiety but not, to my knowledge, advised by the doctor as an official diagnosis. I've been prescribed to take fibre gel in the past. I had a barrium enema years ago for anal pain which didn't show anything of concern, so i was advised it to be proctalgia fugax. The pain i get feels like its right in the center of my anus, sharp sometimes radiating to my lower tummy/groin and usually lasts a few seconds and goes just as quick.
I use to get it maybe once every other month with no clear triggers. I seem to get it more often now (maybe once or twice a month) and when i do i get a sudden urge to go, sometimes hard painful stools, sometimes soft/pebble like (though i've never had what i'd class as consistent bowel habbits), sometimes a bloated feeling and in the last several months mucus passed a little while after a bowel movement...this isn't always but feels like i've had this more recently than i can recall. I seem to get alot of flatuence when this happens too.
It's the mucus that worries me most. Tried keeping a food diary but haven't really been able to identify a trigger yet.
I guess what i'm wanting here is advice on whether these symptoms sound normal in line with IBS and based on experience what foods may be causing the flare ups (if any). My stress levels in terms of anxiety tend to be hit/miss but with todays 'mucus-ee' episode i've been ok.
Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read and reply.

"Help! I am 16 years old and for about 5 weeks now, I have been incredibly sick- when i eat, I'm digesting my food way too quickly and I'm having to go to the bathroom 30 min-1hr after eating and it's very visible that my food isn't being digested. Right before using the restroom, I get really bad stomach pains and stop after I've gone to the restroom. I've had really bad diareah this entire time. I've lost close to 20 pounds in the past 5 weeks because NOTHING is agreeing with my stomach. My GI has done stool samples (all negative) and time blood work and all that showed up is my white blood count is very low and I'm allergic to cows milk. I removed dairy from my diet a long time ago so I know it's not allergies. This is not the first time I've had these symptoms and usually I get rectal bleeding also.
I haven't been able to go school because my constant need to go to the restroom and not being able to control when I have to make a bowel movement. I haven't been able to sleep at night and have been very dizzy and Nauseous. My stomach is tender to the touch. The next step is a upper and lower endoscopy,  but my doctor can't fit me in for 3 weeks. At this point, there's nothing I can eat, not even bland food is agreeing with me. Colon cancer and colon problems do run in the family, but my doctors believe it's either IBD or IBS. The doctor said he can't do any treatment until my procedures. But I'm a student and athlete and I can't lie in bed all day or sit on the toilet for another 3 weeks.

"Hello! I was recently diagnosed officially with IBS, but always was 99% sure I had it for about the past few months. I knew it because my symptoms seemed to match with the IBS descriptions, but now I've been having longer/more symptoms so I'm wondering if this is more than IBS. Does anyone relate to any of these symptoms I have?
?(Brief backstory: I had a stomach bug in Dec 2015, suffered for about a year and a half with very intense acid reflux after that and got better around summer 2017. Starting from winter 2016, I had a lot of gas and bloating that was difficult to get rid of and could sometimes force rumbling noise in my stomach and both those issues I still struggle with today aka what made me think I have IBS. A little more than a month ago, I moved to Korea to teach English and had the most stressful first 3 weeks here settling down getting everything I need to and working at my new job my 2nd day here. After having stomach discomfort and bad digestion and extreme exhaustion, I went to the doctor who said I have a bad lower stomach with IBS and a bad upper stomach with digestion. She prescribed me medication because Korea has medication for everything and I took it well and felt amazing for the first few days, but it seems like the medication is dying off now and I have my bloating and bad digestion back again.)
?- Nausea... sometimes I can't tell if I feel like I'm going to throw up because of something I ate (I have emetophobia aka the fear of throwing up) or because my gas is just really that bad and it's making me feel nauseous. 9/10 times I always end up feeling better when time passes and I burp a few times.
?- A lot of gas and bloating that goes on throughout the WHOLE day and makes my stomach protrude and feel heavy (I read that classic IBS is bloating in the morning and it lowers at night, but I have bloating almost all the time and the most bloating at night...)
?- I don't usually feel hunger as much... or if I do, I can never feel STARVING like I used to. Most of the times my stomach feels like it's so filled with gas so there's not much room for food, but when I start eating just because it's time to eat or I want to eat something yummy even though I'm not hungry, I can eat well.
?- I have back pain/discomfort when I feel like my bloating is strong
?- I don't fart as much as I used to.. really only in the mornings and a few no-noise/restricted ones throughout the day
?- I am usually chronically constipated except for a few mild bouts of diarrhea here and there or a good poop here and there
?- I don't digest well. Some days I have good days and other days I have very bad days, but usually my digestion is just slow and bad in my opinion. Or it's the gas that's just uncomfortable for me every time I eat.
?I'm a pretty anxious person in terms of always stressing out and being an EXTREME hypochondriac, which is why I'm posting here. I think my biggest worry about my symptoms is that I'm pretty much ALWAYS bloated from the moment I wake up and it gets more intense throughout the day till the moment I sleep and my digestion is bad, and I've heard IBS fluctuates with bloating and digestion isn't supposed to be affected so I'm wondering if I have something really bad.... I've also been waking up in the middle of the nights here and there with nausea/stomach pains but I'm not sure if it's from stress, IBS, or I'm waking up with the need to pee and that's just how my stomach feels haha.
?Please feel free to write anything on your minds about my symptoms or ask for clarification!
?Thank you for any and all your inputs!!

"I was diagnosed with IBS several years ago.  The symptoms have changed over the years, but I will describe what I have been dealing with lately.  Constipation is usually the problem - accompanied by lots of gas and burping.  If I do not use the bathroom in a few days, I  take Miralax.  It usually takes a couple of days to work, then I am in the bathroom for three days in a row, and urgency is the name of the game with diarrhea. I have had several close calls, but have somehow managed to find a bathroom.  I feel like I cannot leave my home.  Today  was going fine, but all of a sudden I had to leave my groceries on the supermarket checkout to run to the ladies room - embarrassing.  I cannot go anywhere that I do not have immediate access to the bathroom. About a month ago I started taking Citrucil, but I am still having these issues.  I have been to the gastroenterologist, but she has been unable to help me.  Thoughts?

"After years of being on Mebeverine, to no effect, I went back to my GP who prescribed Hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan).  This has worked really well for me and, for the first time in years, I don't double up in pain after eating a meal.  However, my eyes have become extremely dry (I've seen my optician who did a test) and I'm on my third trial of eye drops to help things.  One eye has become rather inflamed and they're both sore and itchy.
I'm taking three tablets a day at the moment, but am thinking of dropping down to one or two and see if that helps, even though I may suffer from it because of the IBS.  It's a balancing act, isn't it?
Is anyone else on Buscopan who is suffering from the same problem?  If so, what did you do?

"August 15th I was sick for about 4 days, I could not eat a single thing and if I did I would throw it up in the next 15-30 minutes. I was not weak or tired and was experiencing no pain or weight loss at all during this time. After the 4 days, I had very loose stools for about a week which then slowly went back to a more normal looking stool. Then for a few days every morning I had to rush to the bathroom because I could feel like I needed to pass the stool immediately. This happened for about 4 days and it was really loose but still not watery loose. Then I was ok for about a week until I started getting stomach pains. These pains are not just in one spot and they can occur at random parts around my belly button and side of my gut at random times because the pain is not constant. Depending on what I eat (usually dairy) my gut will feel like its popping with gas and every morning I have to wake up at 7am to go pass a mud like stool. I will experience mud like to ribbon like depending on the day and time but I am never constipated as I go at least once a day and there is no blood from what I can see. I suffer from sever anxiety and have had a couple anxiety attacks followed by puking last week. I just have never felt the same since I ate undercooked chicken during that week in AUGSUT.

"Hello,
 I am a 26 year old male and for three years now (since I was 23) I am having colon problems. In these three years I have probably visited the doctor around 20 times and I have been send two times to two different gastronologists. I remember a period within these three years were my symptoms disappeared but other then that they are always there.
 The first symptom I remember related to the colon is mucus on the toiletpaper. After I noticed this I started to pay attention to my stools. The next symptom is the shape of my stool. This varies every bowel movement. It is often loose en shapeless. When it has shape it is mostly flat or pencil thin but always soft. Sometimes it seems normal or even very thick but this is rare. Now lately I also notice that my body cannot digest some types of food. For example mushrooms and onions come out as they came in. Yesterday I ate asparagus and today I saw them coming out as they went in. So this is another food I cannot seem to digest well.
 There are two x-rays made of my stomach. The first one showed that my entire colon was full of stool. The second x-ray (1 year later, last February) showed that my colon still had a lot of stool in it but not as much as on the first xray.
 My doctor subscribed fiber supplements and I have been taking these for probably a year now. They don't seem to do a lot. The gastronologists said I have no worrying symtoms and don't want to do a scope. The first one called it IBS and the second gastronologist said it was a lazy colon.
 But I am worrying a lot. I am thinking about it almost 24/7 and am always googling symtoms. I am planning another visit to the doc this week for the undigested food and to share my worries with him.
 In the years leading up to these problems I have been experiencing severe/extreme stress (still stressed to this day but its getting better, while I did developed a panic disorder). I could not eat most of the time and I almost eat a bunch of bananas each day, since this was the only food i could eat easily). Today I am eating healthy, starting every day with a smoothie and eating a lot of fruit. Plus taking fiber supplements three times a day.
 To summarize, my symptoms today are:
- Mucus in stool (almost always)
- A different shape/structure every BM (pellets, loose, pencil, normal, etc)
- Undigested food (asparagus, mushrooms, onions, spinach)
- Stool almost always floats
- Often a acid smell 
- Anxiety disorder
 One last thing, a couple of months after my colon problems started I developed a breathing disorder. It all started out of the blue one day. I was thinking about my breathing and ever since that day I could not stop thinking about it. I had to breath manually for 2 years. It was horrible.. I am over it now (except in stressed situations it can come back) luckily. I don't know if this has anything to do with the colon problems but I thought I should mention it.
 I am curious to your thoughts and experiences on what could be causing my symtoms.
 Thank you!

"I had indigestion, gas, bloating, constipation, fatigue, depression, pale skin and weight loss due to malnutrition. I thought i had leaky gut, IBD , candinda. All experts tell us to drink 3-4 liters of water everyday or else we will be dehydrated and we will die.
But water is a dehydrant. By definition, in order to hydrate, water has to enter the cell. In order for something to enter the cell, insulin is needed. Water doesn't trigger insulin, which is why people are told to drink it to lose weight. Water needs to be bound to other nutrients to enter the cell, as it would be in meat (20% water), vegetables, fruit, milk, squeezed juices from veggies & fruit. If water somehow enters the cell on it's own, it will dehydrate it. Water accumulates in glycogen stores and the skin, which both together cause bloating.
So my problems were solved when i stopped drinking water and replaced it with fruit juices and milk. I used to pee 15 times daily and sweat like a pig. Now i go 3-4 times and the color of my urine is yellow and not like water.

I certainly dont want to bore people with my medical history, but briefly I'm 51 years old and for around eight years I've been trying to find out why I feel sick/tired/constipated/loose and generally unwell for most of the time. I also struggle sleeping on my side and feel sick and have back pain when I try. I also urinate a lot!!! My doctor has diagnosed IBS and I'm currently trying the FODMAP diet, but my question to everyone is: Has anyone ever beaten IBS, or at least got it under control so they can live a decent life. Any positive stories I'm sure would be greatly appreciated for anyone suffering, I'm now going to try to find a FODMAP friendly restaurant! Wish me luck!
and thanks everyone in advance

"Hi everyone,
I've been suffering with unexplained digestive symptoms for nearly a year. I've lost a lot of weight and the bloating happens after I eat anything, even though I've cut out everything, tried every type of diet under the sun and tried several probiotics.
Ive had gastroscopies, colonoscopies, CT and MRI scans, a SIBO tests and others.
Im not working and miserable and I desperately want to find a solution, or to find a way to manage it at least so I can go back to doing normal things.
One gastroenterologist I saw said that hypnotherapy can help. I don't feel stressed but apparently your stomach and bowels get into a habit or something. Trouble is there's a 12 month waiting list so I might have to pay. Does anyone have any experience with it? Do you know if it can help?
thanks,
Dave

"Hi guys I've had stomach issues for the last 15 years. Send many doctors and specialists. Had heaps of blood tests and stool tests. Xrays, scans, colonoscopy etc. Anyway I'm seeing a new gastro specialist, he has ordered some 3 stool tests and blood tests. The blood test and stool test are normally free where I live, but he said these are more complex and have to be sent interstate for testing so a few $$$ out of pocket. Now I cannot see the specialist for up to 3 more weeks. If something came back on the test would he ring me before that time? I hate waiting the brain ticks over, and I'll start Googling symptoms. Ahhh. Cheers

"I'm now 21 and have been suffering with ""ibs"" since age 16. 
I take loperomide and buscopan when needed during this time. I've cut out foods that cause a flare up along with alcohol and caffeine and eat a very basic diet. This doesn't seem to have helped. I've been to see dietitians and now have a very low lactose diet. 
Also I think it's worth mentioning that I've been suffering with mental health issues from age 11 and are still in the process of getting a diagnosis. 
Now I've given some background, I'm just basically so fed up and hopeless. I've taken steps to help myself but it's so frustrating that nothing seems to work. My social life has been affected (practically non existent) I barely have any friends. My main issue is travel even if for only a short time as when I need to use the loo I have very short notice so I find myself turning down lots of opportunities. There is just nothing more terrifying than being stuck on transport with no access to a toilet. It's so embarrassing and it's ruining my quality of life. 
Does anyone else experience this? If so can you provide and tips? All help is appreciated.

"It all started August 15th ish where I started throwing up after eating anything for about 3-4 days. I tried to think of any possible reason as to why I was throwing up so much and I remembered a day or 2 before the throwing up started I ate some undercooked chicken. After I finished throwing up I had loose stools but I would not consider it watery, for about another week. Fast forward to this week and I am having some discomfort above my penis and it goes anywhere from there to my waist line. I would describe the pain as a nerve pain but sometimes as a pressure. I went to the family doctor and he said it could be a pulled muscle or I pulled my abdominal wall. I do not know whether or not to believe him because there is no pain when I play sports or walk. As I type this I do feel some discomfort and my stools are sometimes loose (usually in the morning) and ribbon like closer to the end of the day. I am not constipated and it does not hurt to go to the washroom. There is also no blood, and I do not feel the urge to have to have a bowel movement after I have one. I have been crying the last couple days and have had many anxiety/panic attacks followed by puking and I need some reassurance. I have had a urine test, blood test, and ultrasound on my abdomen and testicles and received positive results. I feel like I suffer from anxiety just like my mother and it is making me think I have colon cancer. My mother and father have not been checked and are 56-58 years old and otherwise in good health and no one that I know of on either side has had the disease. Im 21 years old.

"So I'm in the middle of a really bad IBS flare at the moment. Over the last 5 weeks it's gone from cramping and loose stools to exteme cramps that cause me to be doubled over in pain every time I eat followed by urgent runs to the toilet for severe diarrhoea. I'm always in the loo within 30-45 mins of eating anything- even plain crackers or toast.
I'm pretty good at force feeding myself (hence why i never loose weight from my ibs) but it's getting to the point now where I don't want to eat because of the pain. I never skip meals but yesterday I hardly ate, then had eggs on toast for dinner and bam- straight through me.
I'm pretty lucky at work at the moment as I've been doing some office work so can run off to the loo with no problem, but that's stopping soon and I need to go back to treating patients and you're not allowed to just run off whenever you like! My only option appears to be don't eat all day, but I'm on my feet a lot and I have low blood pressure, so not eating greatly increases the risk of me passing out, which I don't want either.
I've never talked to anyone about my IBS but it crossed my mind to go to my manager but it's so embarrassing and most people don't understand. I've been told IBS is 'just a tummy ache ' before!
Has anyone talked to their work about their ibs?

"Hello
I'm new here and would love some advice. Last week I started with a tummy ache, gurgling tummy and backache. I had this for a few days then it eased but has come back. I have a constant growling tummy like hunger pains but I'm not hungry. I'm eating more to try get rid of the very loud noises but it makes it worse. I can't get to sleep because of it and when I do it wakes me up. I'm had some heartburn too but not bad. I've had a few of loose stools over the week but then normal stools. I've not been diagnosed with IBS I had a colonoscopy last year as I was passing mucus and blood but all came back normal and they blamed constipation. Are these symptoms of IBS? My GP looked disgusted I went with a growling tummy like I'm wasting her time but it is driving me mad. There is no let up with it. Its constant. I've not had bad tummy pains just dull aches. Never experienced this before

"Some quick context: I'm 18, IBS-A since 14. Biggest issue is constant flatulence. 
School is coming up in a couple of days and I'm panicking as the past few school years have been a living hell with the flatulence. It's so embarrassing and everyone hates me for it. I feel so bad and guilty for making the students around me in class having to be near me, so I just stopped going to school. My attendance for the last 3 years has been around 50% and dropping. 
I'm doing my A levels. I want to go to uni. I want to succeed. But the guilt and embarrassment and stomach pains just make me forget all my aspirations and it's so tempting to drop out of school and just hide forever. 
I've tried every medication the doctor can recommend and prescribe, I've done every diet, every online cure. And at this point I've given up. 
I'm not entirely sure what I'm trying to achieve with this post, but I guess I just needed somewhere to vent a little. 
So if anyone reading this has any advice for coping with IBS  in school/work/public, they'd be greatly appreciated. Or even just stories about their own experience in these places. It's nice to know we're not alone even though it feels that way.

"Hi I'm a 15 year old boy teen.
About a week ago I started getting mucus on the side of my stool, it wasn't a lot but I knew it was there.
In that week I also kept getting constipation and a little bit of diarrea when I finally could go to the toilet and do my business.
My symptoms are
Constipation
Mucus around stool
A bit of blood on stool when constipated
Rumbling stomach after food
A few minor cramps
Itchiness around bottom area only at night
diarrhoea
A bit of darker colour on stool ( but only once or twice )
I've been to see a doctor and she suspects it could be IBD and is sending me to get a blood test.
I just keep worrying that I might have something different and a lot worse. I don't really get pain anywhere at all, which I know is a good sign. 
But just need to know if anyone else has this or the same symptoms as me.
I know the age for IBD is 15 to 40 and I am 15.
Please can someone help me ?!
It will mean a lot ?!
I know I put this in IBS section but it could be IBD or IBD.

"This is a mystery. I had two severe painful attacks in the right mid quadrant side. I was on vacation and a nearest hospital was no available. Came back from vacation feeling ok, I started to pass yellow bowel movements, therefor I started the investigation.
I had so far 3 Ultrasounds done and everything looks good, my Liver enzymes are all good testes 3 times, Albumin, INR, AST/ALT, GGT! (My GGT is even lower vs lab range which is strange)
I had endoscopy / gastroscopy they found Hpylori which I was treated for with triple therapy antibiotics. After that stools sometimes were light color sometimes darker it would always switch up but for the most part more on the pale, side took some probiotics and had times where the stools were a mid brown share. All of sudden I started to have diarrhea that came and stuck around for 2 weeks, I decided to do a CT scan which came back clean.
I am confused at this point it doesn't seem its my pancreas, all tests fine (except Amylase and Lipase coming in lower 1 point vs lab range) - 3 ultrasounds , 1 cat scan normal with contrast.
Stomach pain is very minimal, almost none I am not in any pain which is crazy last 3-4 months i was in moderate pain I think due to gastritis, but as gastritis healed most of this pain away. I am thinking of doing a HIDA scan to check if my gallbladder maybe is not emptying properly, I have done stool tests to check for bacteria and that came all clear.
Running out of options what you guys think? what further tests should I do? Do I just move on with my life it's been 9 months since the symptoms have started. I lost 20 lbs and now gained most of it back. Basically i was 170 went down to 148 when i got hpylori treated it went back up to 160 now i am down to 155.

"Hello folks, 
So I'm currently in the middle of a medical investigation, trying to figure out of my symptoms are from anxiety/stress, Zoloft, IBS, or possibly something else. I'll divide my story into sections. 
Gradeschool: 
I was shy, anti-social, had problems making friends. 
I was diagnosed with being hyper-active, and placed on Ritalin. 
When my ability to focus in school worsened, I was sent to biofeedback therapy-and it did work: My grades improved. 
I had anxiety a lot as a kid, usually in socially heavy situations- like parties, ceremonies, and events like that. 
I also had anxiety when it came to taking vacations, long car or plane rides often did it. 
The most common symptom I had: Diarrhea. 
During trips, multiple stops at rest areas would be needed.
During parties or ceremonies, I'd have to sometimes rush off to the bathroom. 
I was also one of those kids who preferred going to the bathroom at home, so in my earlier years I often held it and rushed home after getting off the bus. 
High School: 
I was sent to military school my freshman year, and I can only describe the experience as a nightmare. I was picked on, couldn't make friends with anyone, overweight, and extremely homesick- so my anxiety was through the roof around that time- I felt totally alone and powerless there. On top of that, my body didn't respond well to the military drills they regularly put us through- I ended up being in the bathrooms for a long time afterwards: Diarrhea. 
After that, I returned home and went to public school- which was much much easier- I felt more comfortable. 
I still had trouble focusing, so I returned to biofeedback, and sustained decent grades. 
I had a panic attack once- in the middle of class. I don't know why it happened, but suddenly it felt like something scary was coming. I looked at the door, and the fear just made me think: Something bad's gonna come through that door. My entire body felt paralyzed, I couldn't move, and for several minutes I felt absolute terror- but I remained silent the whole time- nobody could tell I was having a panic attack. Eventually it passed and everything was fine- but I'll never forget it. 
College:
This is where things really got interesting- I'm convinced I experienced potentially psychosomatic symptoms (but I'll explain that in a minute).
Stomach issues I had in college also revolved around diarrhea.
Every time I underwent a big night of drinking, the next morning: Horrible diarrhea.
Every time I was under intense stress: Bouts of diarrhea.
Here's where the psychosomatic stuff happened: I was in a failing relationship, and during that time I developed a sharp pain in my right side. 
It started happening often enough throughout the day that my parents had the hospital look at me, but after all the tests: Nothing. Everything looked fine. 
Soon after that, the relationship ended, the pain stopped, and I haven't felt it since- which can only mean 1 thing: It was in my head. 
Post College:
I took a job with an incredibly mean and verbally abusive manager. 
His personal life was so messed up, and he had such a horrible attitude, that every day he'd basically treat me as his personal punching bag, and verbally take it all out on me. 
I alerted the upper staff, but nobody did anything- so it continued. 
Eventually the stress from that job triggered Alopecia in my system, and I lost all my facial hair and developed patches on my head. I had to start shaving my head so it didn't look so weird. Then my cousins started asking me if I had cancer. (That couldn't have been more awkward)
Soon after that, my manager and I had an argument, and that point I'd had enough- I quit, walked out, and never went back. 
Soon after THAT, my father started getting worried about my stress/anxiety, and suggested I see a therapist- so I went. 
The therapist diagnosed me with ADD, OCD, and Acute Anxiety Disorder. 
She placed me on Zoloft, and within 6 months my hair grew back + my anxiety seemed to decrease a bit- it was nice. 
Several Years after College: 
I moved 3 hours from my home town to attend school, and I wasn't sticking with my medication very well (procrastinating refills- I was just being lazy and dumb).
Whenever I'd be off of my medication for a few days to a week, my anxiety would start to physically surface- and I'd start feeling split-second sharp pains in my chest. (palpitations)
I'd be emotionally shaky too, very irritable, almost as if I were paranoid. (And maybe I actually was)
During this time, I was also having significant stress- due to school, relationship, and employment issues- so I started having bouts of diarrhea and thin stools again. 
Eventually school ended, I was able to move back home, and my stools became thick and regular again. 
The past 3-4 months:
I've been having alternating bouts of diarrhea and thin stools. 
Every bathroom session the stool is different/irregular.
I've also been having chronic gas too. 
So I went to my doctor, and he suggested that maybe I'm lactose intolerant. I've avoided lactose as best as possible the last several weeks, and my gas HAS decreased- so I think he was right. 
As for alternating bouts of thin and loose stools, here's what we've tested so far:
All conditions pertaining to average blood work- negative.
Thyroid issues- Negative. 
Celiacs Disease- Negative. 
Diabetes- Negative.
Small intestine conditions- Negative.
He inspected my anus, felt around: nothing. All Good. 
Sent in 2 fecal samples: Came back good. 
So everything keeps coming back negative, but I'm still having alternating bouts of thin stools and loose stools. 
As it currently stands: I don't know what's going on with me. 
Zoloft is known to cause constipation, thin stools, upset stomach, diarrhea, and several other side effects- but after being on it for several years, I would think the side effects would've stopped by now- it's strange. 
It COULD just be IBS- that's what my doctor thinks. After all the tests have come back negative, he's placing all his money on IBS- and seeing as how I have a history of anxiety problems, perhaps my anxiety and stress are effecting it. 
That plus: 
Alcohol gives me diarrhea/thin/loose stools the next morning- even these days. 
Lactose gives me horrible gas.
Caffeine triggers diarrhea/thin/loose stools for me too- even ""decaf"" (it's not completely caffeine free). 
Maybe it's a combination of Anxiety & Zoloft Side Effect-induced IBS. 
What do you think?

"About 5 months ago I started to have frequent diarrhea. I eat very healthy expect for the occasional night out. My symptoms began to get worse and worse. ( diarrhea, followed by a day or 2 of constipation, vomiting, pain on left side of abdomin, abdomin spasms... the list literally goes on) I've don't CT scans, ultra sounds, colonoscopy, blood work, and stool samples. My dr took very long to get me into these things and my flare up had seemingly gone away or got better during most of the test. I feel like my dr's are missing something or don't believe what I am saying. Recently, I started to notice black spots in my stool and I waited to see if it was just once or it was more frequent. After about a week I told my dr and she responded with ""good thing you had a colonoscopy to rule out inflammation"". I feel like if I didn't have inflammation during this time I could still have it now. Has anyone experienced this? Thank you in advance!

"I'm hoping someone can either give me advice or just soothe my mind a little. I'm 21 and I've been suffering with ""IBS"" since I was 13. 
At first it would only be occasionally and generally started because of something that I had eaten, but since I've been roughly 18, it started to get a lot worse. 
I know it can be triggered by stressful circumstances and I'm aware that that's what sets mine off, but in the past year/18 months, I'm constantly ill.
I suffer from chronic diarrhoea and go to the toilet up to 20 times a day. 
I've seen so many doctors and had every test done but not even a food intolerance comes up. 
It's gotten to the point recently where I cannot actually make it to the bathroom anymore and much to my embarrassment, my partner suggested I invest in some adult nappies (he wasn't being mean, he's genuinely concerned but it made me so upset)
At the age of 21, I shouldn't be so dibilitated, but IBS literally makes my life a living hell. I'm exhausted all the time, my skin and hair feel awful and despite the fact  that I cannot retain my food, I'm gaining weight. 
I'm so fed up of the way I feel and I feel I need reassurance to know I'm not alone in this and that it's actually real, because a large portion of my family and friends believe I make myself ill from panicking and that I can just turn it off in my head. 
If anyone, anyone at all has any advice on how to calm it or any foods to try to help, I'm all ears.

"Around 2-3 weeks ago, I started constantly at night nearly every night waking up with upset stomach, feeling sick and not being able to sleep or move without sitting there for around 2 hours with something warm on my stomach to sooth it. At first I thought it was Acid Reflux as I've had that several times before and it wasn't going to be a surprise either. Tried taking Rennes and Omeprazole I think it's called and it didnt take it away.
I googled my symptoms whilst on holiday last week and found that everything that was happening especially my change in toilet habits. I normally go 2 to 3 times a day and now I was constipated and then suddenly turned into diarrohea. I knew I had IBS. I've been taking buscopan for the past week used all the 20 tablets over a period of 7 days and now it feels a lot better through the day and the last two days at night has been fine. I felt a little sick last night from it and the hot compress worked a treat accompanied by one buscopan.
my question is: Is there any way I can get rid of this for good? It has been a pain for the past 2-3 weeks, I've never had it before, I'm 20 years of age and a healthy weight. Last week it almost ruined my holiday and I'm going away in November to Budapest and I don't want to have that ruined.

"I've gone to a GI doc and he confirmed my diagnosis without tests, but I wasn't too impressed with him and felt that he wasn't as informed as he could've/should've been and really only prescribed an expensive probiotic that stopped working after 2 weeks and an anti-spasmodic that doesn't help me treat the underlying cause of my presumed IBS.
I'm planning on asking my GP for a recommendation for a nutritionist/dietitian and/or naturo path doc to help with an elimination diet. 
But I also read somewhere that they can do a blood tests to find elevated markers that show up with 90% accuracy in those with IBS and celiac's I believe. http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/294195.php
So I'm going to bring this up to my GP and see if he'll do that and maybe even a SIBO test too.

"I am not sure if this is IBS I have.
Symptoms are: feeling really sick, sometimes more severe than others like I am about to throw up. Usually on the same day or the following day my bowels will move several times and are very soft with the urgency to go. Can also experience a lot of wind when feeling sick.
I have suffered for several years with this and been in and out of hospital. Lots of tests done which have all been clear. Been put on anti sickness tablets which helped so I was able to eat as this was a struggle when feeling so sick. Also tried on Buscopan which made no difference. Kept lots of food diaries and cant work out what could be causing this. I can eat the same things one week and be fine then the following week not be!
Does anyone else get this? I don't suffer the usual symptoms that most people get with IBS like stomach cramps etc. Main symptoms with me seem to be feeling sick and the softer bowels, going several times.

"am a 21 year old male who has experienced symptoms of ibs(I hope) since April 2017. It all started with ONE single episode of bright red blood in the toilet bowl(I also felt a pop and was likely straining so I assumed internal hemmoroids). Let's just say that that never happened again and was isolated. Fast forward probably about a month when I had blood on the toilet paper(same color as like a bloody nose and probably a similar amount). At this point it felt like hemmoroids that I got consistently like this for about two weeks until it stopped(there was a single time where there was bright red blood on the outside of the stool but no other time). Then I had a week of normal until i got blood on the toilet paper for a few days(prep H made this all better every time). The thing is after this ALL of the bleeding stopped and for months now my movements have been very inconsistent. I would have loose stools one day and constipation the next(sometimes it changed like this during the same day). Pretty much every time I go now i felt either itchy or burning after(like roids again). My stool lately has also been green probably 50% of the time( lime green) and aren't close to diarrhea at all when they are this color. And I have started to get gurgling and mild abdominal discomfort for the past two weeks now(seems to increase during the afternoon and is more common when at school). The reason I think this is probably ibs is due to the inconsistent pattern of these symptoms. That being said my mom has colitis so idk if that changes anything.

"Hi there
I have been diagnosed with IBS by my GP and a Consultant. This was after I became bloated one day and since then it has never gone away.
I was tested for celiac, pylori and general things and all came back fine/negative.
I am bloated 24/7 regardless of if I have eaten or not. From first thing in the morning until I go to bed I am constantly bloated.
I feel no pain or discomfort though which I am grateful for. I have frequently bowel movements and go to the toilet on average 3-4 times a day.
Some foods are not disgusted properly and I see them in the toilet bowl like they haven't been touched. From this I can tell that the food I have eaten only hours ago (possibly 4hours) have already passed through my system
A doctor just said that my intestines is not pushing my food through as quick hence gas builds up...but this contradicts my frequent bowel movements.
People say write down the foods that elevates your symptoms but I find that only one kind of thing i eat will increase bloating and thats oily foods...i.e. olive oil in salads as a dressing, deep fried food like KFC. Apart from this I have not noticed any severe effects from what I eat.
I have tried probiotics, charcoal tablets with no effect. My GP said to try low fodmaps so I am yet to do that. But I don't have much confidence in it considering that I am constantly bloated and it doesn't vary much.
I am at a loss as to what to try next...
Anyone with the same IBS symptoms as myself?
Thank you

"Hi I'm a 15 year old boy, a couple of days ago I went to the toilet and I noticed I had mucus on it not a lot just a bit. I still sometimes see it now.
My symptoms are
Constipation
Bit of diahrea in the morning
Lots of wind after a meal
Rumbles in my belly mainly after a meal. ( can last up to 10/13 minutes )
And minor cramp
I have told a parent and she said I have a poor diet I don't eat vegatables or fruit at all.
I have no past family history of anything serious there.
I just really need to ease my mind and stop stressing about it.
I don't know if it's IBS or IBD I've just seen the symptoms that I've been experiencing.
Thank you... please help!

"Hello, I am a teenager, and for as long as I can remember I have had stomach problems. When I was younger I was sensetive to my mother's milk, and as I grow I find im lactosentalerant as well, with just a sensetive stomach overall. But my biggest problem was when I was diagnosed with IBS- or whatever you call it for children...
It was a problem because it would cause such intense cramping and discomfort that at such a young age I couldn't deal with it and went to the emergency room screaming often, most of the times my mother thought my appendix was going to explode because no one should be in that much abdominal pain!
A few years later when the problems still persisted she took me to a doctor and they eliminated everything, than diagnosed me with (pediatric name...) IBS. I was put on this teeny tiny pill- anti depressant mind you. Which in the end made me depressed actually.
Now I have been to the doctors multiple times to try and find a new medication that does not harm my mental state, nor my physical one for the most part. It is a struggle for sure..
For now, besides the normal- Eat right excersise right, sleep right; does anyone have tips on how to deal with IBS?

"I am a 28-y-o with 2 kids and I have been suffering from urinary incontinence for a little while, investigations so far are pointing towards pelvic floor damage.
Until recently I had no bowel problems, but I've recently started getting sudden urges to pass stool and I'm often (average once per day) not managing to hold on till I get to the loo. Sometimes it's loose stool but often it's just normal, not diarrhoea - I just can't hold on for long enough. Typically I'll be in the middle of something and suddenly need to go, crampy stomach pain, and if there's not a loo within about 30 secs walking distance I've had it.
Could this be IBS? Or something different? I know I should go back to the doctor but I feel so ashamed and embarrassed.

"Hello all, i am newly diagnosed with ibs about 2-3 weeks ago. I am starting to think i am misdiagnosed and may have whats known as Celiac disease. I think this because i also had an ultrasound and blood tests. I had elevated liver enzymes and this was confirmed to be fatty liver based on the ultrasound results. Also gallbladder sludge was found on the ultrasound. I will say i am not a drinker because im 19 years old. So i was doing some research to find a correlation between Fatty liver, gallbladder sludge and IBS symptoms. I came across celiac because with it you are more prone to devoloping gall bladder and liver issues (along with other issues). So unless I am the unluckiest 19 year old kid ever having all these issues and being a physically fit guy and maintaining a pretty healthy diet i would say Celiac would be an option to consider. I want to see what you guys think before i get tested, does this sound like celiac or what? Also i want to post this because my Gastroenterologist does say IBS is common it can often be misdiagnosed. So if youre an individual like me who hasnt been benefitting too much from some of these medicines or eating better i would talk to your doctor about celiac.

"I've had IBS for over 2 years now, the first year was really hard but I eventually cut out all meat (except from fish, mainly just tuna) and I also cut out all dairy products. Since then my IBS had been so great for the majority of the time, sometimes it would act up but I could handle it and wasn't afraid to leave the house. Now for some reason over the last 5 weeks, every time I go for a poo it's always diarrhoea and I can never predict when it will come, making me terrified to leave the house again. Nothing in my diet had changed when this started, I go for regular long dog walks so I do get some exercise during the day. I recently joined the gym and have been going twice a week, I actually joined around the time the D started. I have tried eating very bland and minimally throughout the day and nothing has worked. It's starting to make me incredibly miserable, and I'm going to be starting uni soon, which is making my anxiety about my IBS worse. I don't want to take loperamide every day because I'm scared that my body will get used to it and it will have no effect. Every time I have D (which is daily) I want to cry. I started taking a probiotics supplement yesterday because I heard they can help with IBS and diarrhoea symptoms, but I don't have much hope. Can anybody help me?

"Hello sorry I'm new to this forum so I hope you mind me sharing my experience with you. I've always had a sensitive stomach and have suffered on / off with a painful bloated stomach.
However, the last 6 months I have had really bad symptoms. I  wake up every night feeling very sick and can't lie on my side so I have to sit up in bed because I feel like my stomach is bloated and there is a heavy feeling in my lower stomach that doesn't seem to move. I then feel throughout the same day that same feeling of pain and bloated in my stomach. It's unbearable and when I go running I can feel this lump that's right inside my stomach that's causing this discomfort. I'm convinced it's more than IBS but every time I go to the docs they say it's IBS and give me Omeprozole which gave me bad side effects so I stopped taking them. Now I'm just freestyling and trying to find foods that are making it worse.  I've never before had this feeling and it's affecting my day to day life and I don't know what else to do??
Please can anyone relate to this and offer any help? Does this sound like IBS? Thank you

"Hi, I guess IBS isn't very common in males - but I wanted to find out what other males/females are doing to help with their IBS?
I'm now on week 3 of a flare up - not complete consistant but i'd say a good 80% of the time I feel awful. I'm suffering with extreme gas, which seems to get trapped, nausea/sicky feeling and loss of appitite. 
The docors don't really seem to be interested just labelling it ""IBS"" which is fine - but there has to be something that can be done? I only started getting IBS about 2 years ago when I was 26 - all i've had so far from my GP is a stool sample test (which came back fine)
Is there anything I should be doing differently? I'm literally at the end of my tether now - ruins my day-to-day life now as many days I dont have energy, or just feel too sick!

"One night about a month ago I had to keep running to the toilet with diarrhoea. I didn't feel sick in any other way, but just had diarrhoea and couldn't seem to relieve it. Out of desperation I took several Imodium. As expected, this made me constipated, however what made it worse was that I had this constant discomfort in my stomach/lower abdomen.
Just to be safe, I saw a doctor, who said that the discomfort was just due to the Imodium. A few days later, the constipation ended, but the uncomfortable sensation remained. On top of that, while I was able to go to the toilet, I always felt as though I could not entirely empty my bowels, and this was highly frustrating. Nevertheless, I left it for a couple of weeks and went back to the doctor, however this time it was a different one. I explained the symptoms to him and said that the main reason I was concerned was because it had been so long and nothing had changed. He didn't seem to think it was anything too serious, and said, like his colleague, that it was likely just the Imodium taking time to get out of my system. He told me to get Lactulose, and take it twice-daily. I did this, but after four days it still felt as though I couldn't entirely relieve my bowels.
It has now been over four weeks since this occurrence and, although the symptoms have gotten more bearable, the constant discomfort and inability to completely empty my bowels has been making me feel depressed and has been causing me to have broken sleep and wake up early. I have looked online (which I know is generally frowned upon), and it seems possible that I have IBS. However, neither doctor ever mentioned it. I am about to go on holiday for a couple of weeks (the sickness came at a really inconvenient timing), but will see a doctor when I come back, assuming the symptoms have not disappeared.
But in the meantime, do I have IBS? I think it's quite possible, but my mum believes it is too much of a coincidence for it to happen at the same time I had the initial diarrhoea, and she believes it to be a stomach bug of some sort. Although I am not in pain, thought of having a long-term illness and having to deal with this constant discomfort possibly for the rest of my life is quite scary, and it's all I can think about.

"I was diagnosed with chronic constipation when i was 12 and went through many phases of different medications wo try and keep me regular. only when i was 17 was i diagnosed with IBS. it has been a constant battle with different GP's to try and say to them nothing you tell me to do works. I am now 22, tried so many perscription laxitives painkillers and fibre drinks im almost at my wits end. i took things into my own hands as i felt as if i wasnt being properly listened to at me gp. all they would say is ""eat more fibre"" ""drink more Water"" i even went to a dietician and gave up when she said "" i dont understand why if your doing all this nothings working?"" so i gave up. if you dont feel like anyone takes you seriously why bother trying to listen?
i started a new diet where i ate the same breakfast lunch and dinner every day. i had yoghurt with fruit in the morning, 2 ryvita crackers with peanut butter with a handful of cherry tomatoes and a basic side salad for tea. this went hand in hand with 3km runs 5 days a week. i did this for about 3 months and lost weight felt great and was beaming.
This was 3 weeks ago. ever since then ive been battling with small attacks and when i have an attack i cant run. i know when an attack comes on because i feel bloated, i get a shooting pain that comes and gos down my right arm, i feel so constipated that i feel is if im more than ready to go to the toilet, but nothing moves. its as if i have a blockage. this will last a few days until i cant deal with it- i limit what i eat and drink mountains of water and do as much squats and my cramps in my stomach let me. 
2 days ago i went to the pharmacy and got ducolax to try and ease my discomfort. yesterday was absolutey horrible. from one extreme to the other and i was never off the toilet with horrible cramps and a stomach in knotts. feeling sick and having sweats. i was taking peppermint oil tea, ibuprofen and had my hotwater bottle all day.
had a bath last night and started to feel a bit better. now this morning ive had to phone into work sick again. i worry they dont actually understand how bad an ibs attack can be. my insides burn/ sting/ under my ribs up my back up my sides- which lets me know its not my stomach that is affected by my ibs. i feel nauseaus im so tired after sleeping all night i have a headache.
i just dont know what to do. does this happen to anyone else? is there anything anyone knows i can do to make myself better today as im starting to worry about my job but not only that my sanity and own health. what am i doing wrong?
what i wanted from my doctor / dietician was- do this. not "" you have ibs, deal with it""

"Hey, I'm Katherine, I'm a 14 year old girl and I was diagnosed with IBS a little over a year ago, it's ran in the family unfortunately. But ever since I have had IBS it's basically ruined my life, I've been embarrassed in school more than once because my school nurse thought I was lying and made me to back to class rather than at least letting me sit in a quiet space on my own. At home when I am in agonizing pain of a IBS episode of diarrhea after I am left either shaking or in tears due to the pain, I'm normally in pain for over an hour with a minute lasting cramp that feels like a massive knot and hurts like hell over and over again. The buscopan tablets that I have been prescribed with do help but not fast enough. Anyway, while I'm in a lot of pain does anyone know a way which I can at least calm myself down so it won't hurt so much? Also is it normal for the pain to be worse on a period? And also I notice I have also been having a lot of sickly burps and/or other gas lately and I'm wondering if that's anything to do with the bloating of IBS?  Many thanks, Katherine Pierce

"Have always suffered from loose ish stools with my IBS. Was only diagnosed earlier this year after going through a stressful event. Have always been able to treat my symptoms with Mebeverine as food didnt make much of a difference it was triggered by anxiety and stress.
Said stressful event is now arising again and my IBS is worse than ever. Have had loose watery stools for 4 days. Maybe one day imbetween without anything. Mebeverine isnt helping anymore. Can hardly leave the house.
Doctors cant see me till next week however have been confirmed with IBS so was wondering how people got on with immodium? Does it help to stop D all together? I dont want to be taking a number of them every day.
Im already on anxiety medication which i have been on for years. Trying to eat plainer foods but it isnt making any difference.
Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated.

There's no point wasting my time taking the buscopan or mebervine the dr suggests as it doesn't help me, after repeatedly going back with the same symptoms and a look at my family history (my dad has ulcerative colitis) I was referred for a colonoscopy, had this December 2016 everything came back normal and was told I have a healthy bowel. I don't necessarily have any triggers as such but I have noticed the past few months anxiety has been a big issue for me, but I'm anxious about my ibs flaring up, the more I think about it the more it happens. I've resulted in taking loperamide hydrochloride to stop myself going to the toilet completely when the pain and poop urges come. Does anybody else suffer with anxiety triggers and what helps them and if I went back to the doctors would they prescribe anything for anxiety? Also I am trying to find a way that I could possibly work from home or freelance so that I'm relaxed and free to use the toilet when I need to (the toilet at work isn't so private) just wondering what types of jobs are recommended for ibs D sufferers as I can't carry on like this for the rest of my life....

"I had IBS symptoms for three years, following a bad dose of flu. Before the flu I could eat anything and my bowel habits were like clockwork with no problems at all. I was certain that the flu made me sensitive to something but what was that something?
I had most of the classic symptoms - cramps and wind, urgency for the toilet, most of the time it being very loose, and most times only just making it there! Sometimes it would be all ribbony or just mucus. I never had any bloating or nausea but the cramps and toilet thing really got me down, sometimes I would go several times a day.
I am vegetarian and eat healthily, I'm 53 now and have been the same weight since I was a teenager (just over nine stones) so this was rather galling as well.
Last Spring (2006) I saw my doctor who sent me for a barium enema and the results came back negative, also several blood tests which also were perfectly OK, so I was told that in view of this 'it looks like IBS'. As my doctor didn't offer any 'cures' I decided to help myself and started a log of my toilet habits to see if there was any pattern - the only vague pattern I could see was that at weekends it was slightly better (Hmm, I never have lunch at weekends...). I racked my brains for an answer looking at all manner of causes, even down to the phases of the moon! Could it be stress at work as weekends seemed to be better? But I like my work and could not see how stress could be it - I wasn't stressed at work! Then June 2006 I amalgamated my lunch of cheese and tomato on toast with breakfast and cutting out some of the breakfast namely two slices of bread. Almost immediately my symptoms were a little better but by October they came back. Then at the end of January this year I stopped having lunch and felt better for it.
The breakthrough came at the start of February when I cut out bread altogether, the cramps went more or less immediately and my toilet habits started to get better. Since then the cramps have disappeared and I go to the toilet normally first thing in the morning and generally again at some point in the day normally too. (Before all this started I would go to the toilet two times a day normally). There is no urgency now and it being a normal consistency too.
So it seems in my case that bread is the culprit, or rather the yeast or maybe the consistency of bread. It cannot be a wheat intolerance as I have a large breakfast of Shredded Wheat, bran and muesli, and I also eat pasta, cake, biscuits etc.
The other week I had some mild cramping and thought 'oh no it's come back', but then discovered that the milkshake I had drunk an hour earlier contained yeast! The rest of that went into the bin.
I was always of the opinion that, in my case anyway, that it could not be caused by stress or some 'mind' thing, I was convinced it was a food related cause and I am keeping my fingers crossed that I am right in my thinking that the problem was yeast, especially in bread.

"All my problems started last year at the end of August, when we were on a vacation with my family. I had symptom(s) of: strong diarrhea, feeling that my bowel is not emptied totally. 
By now all have symptoms like: fatigue (reason could be falling asleep at 1 AM and waking up 7-8 AM), since a few months ago I started waking up every morning to that I'm passing a lot of gas, and feeling the need of passing stool (it is always succesful,sometimes i go twice or three times in the morning too), my stools are thinner (not always), sometimes I see blood on my stool surface (i think i also have fissure since i checked it out with mobile phone camera (LOL), and it looked like a wound sooo yeah.), also I have sometimes nausea which is most of the time comes with lower-right abdominal pain which is sharp or dull. When this pain is present and I go to the toilet more than 2-3 times it'll hurt even more and I can't pass nothing but ribbon like stools. I also have sometimes pain in my left-middle part of my upper abdomen which is stabbing. I've realized that, after eating pizza or food which is spicier I'll have diarrhea in the next day morning. Do I have colon cancer? I'm 19 years old and I'm very very afraid. Please if someone has/had the same symptoms reply!!
P.S: sorry for my english.

"Hi everyone, I am new to this site, so I apologize if anyone has already posted something similar. 
So, my stomach has been acting super weird since last Saturday. I started having very mild cramps in my lower abdomen, but it was so mild, that I was able to let it go and still have a great day. Sunday morning, however, things got bad. I started having bad pain throughout my entire abdomen... from my lower abdomen, to the left of my belly button, to above it. It hurt so bad that I sat with a heating pad on my stomach. My fiance' had me take some pepto bismol, which helped ease the pain. The pain felt much better that I even went to a basketball game and had a blast. The pain came back later, which I took more pepto, and once it eased up again, I went to bed. Everyday since then, I have been getting better and better. The pain is very mild now and has settled in my lower abdomen and has been bothering my colon. Today, however, got a little weird. I woke up feeling totally fine, but I had a chocolate muffin for breakast, and those muffins often go right through me, but I made a dumb decision to chance it today. Well, the cramping got really bad and was able to use the restroom but it was a lot more loose than usual. I called my doctor and got in to see her early this morning. She did a very thorough exam and asked me all kinds of questions. At the end, she concluded that I may just have something weird just going through me and it's making it's way out. She said she does not suspect anything serious and just wants me to start taking more probiotics. 
I just want to know what everyone else thinks... has anyone else gone through anything like this? Could this be the start of IBS. I sure hope not because I'm only 94 pounds and don't want to lose any more weight. If you have any other suggestions, let me know!
Thanks!!!!

"Hi, just a random question.
Are there any specific blood tests that can help towards determining GI disease is present? I don't mean anything that can definitely diagnose a specific condition but just something that would indicate there could be an issue. For example, low iron levels could indicate a GI bleed, etc. I'm also aware of coeliac screening. Is there anything else at all?
Also, I've been have some BM issues and will be making an appt with myGP. Would it be appropriate to take a stool sample along with me (I have a couple of urine sample test tubes and could use one of them) or do you need to wait for GP to actually request one?
Thanks for any help.

"Anyone experience this?
I am unsure of what I am feeling.
Was diagnosed by Naturopath as having ibs-c. Constipation under control after almost 5 months. No more ab discomfort. Huge diet change. Also had rectal pressure for awhile but that is steadily getting milder and milder. Some days none at all. But now for the past 4 days I have a feeling of something sliding up and down in my rectum. There is no bleeding.
I thought it was a hemorrhoid and tried a glycerin suppository which helped. But the next day it was back. Tried a hemorrhoid suppository and it hurt really bad and made the problem worse so I stopped.
I do not feel this issue until later in the day. There is nothing sticking out of my rectum!
Has anyone experienced this?
I am making an appointment with the doctor but I am very scared.

"HellIo  I am having a colonoscopy on Thursday afternoon of this week.  I am due to take my moviprep first lot 7pm Wednesday evening and 2nd lot 6am Thursday morning.  On the leaflet is says to eat nothing after a light lunch before 1pm on the wednesday eating white bread rice chicken etc obviously nothing high fibre.  It says with moviprep there is no need to start low fibre diet a few days before as in the past.  I suffer from IBS C and having been taking fybogel/mebeverine for around 8 weeks. only in the morning.  I go everymorning fairly easily but sometimes the stools are still either1 or 2 on the bristol scale but sometimes 3 or 4 although they are easy to pass.  I did wonder if it is the fybogel clearing old stool from the body.  I am having the scope because I have had blood in the stools for a few weeks.  I am 69 years of age.  The hospital doctor said I will probably having stomach cramps when I start the prep as I have IBS.  My husband had a scope in February and had no pain  whilst doing the prep just the usual flatulence after the scope.  Any IBS sufferer who has had a colonoscopy offer any advice.  I also suffer from anxiety so you can imagine my state at the moment.  I have convinced my self that it is colon cancer and I can't get it out of my mind.  Any advice appreciated.

"Hi. I'm a 23 y/o female and I was recently diagnosed with IBS. I just wanted to see if anyone has had similar symptoms. I'm skeptical and also a little paranoid it could be something else. My symptoms typically seem worse in the morning. Some mornings I wake up feeling constipated, but I'm usually able to go in about 20 mins, although I feel as if I didn't ""go"" all the way. With this comes a crampy stomach feeling and bloating. There are some mornings where I wake up extremely nauseous and it can last for a few hours. There are days where I feel bad, after I've eaten terribly I can feel bloated and have bad stomach cramps, but this doesn't ALWAYS happen when I've eaten bad. And sometimes my symptoms in the morning follow a day where I ate well for the most part (like yesterday I ate healthy all day, but I did have a handful of Mike & Ike's candies). Does anyone else have these symptoms? I've had experiences with dr's incorrectly diagnosing me, so I would love some confirmation of possible.

"Hi, I've just signed up to this forum desperate for some help.
For the last year / 18 months I've been suffering with IBS symptoms such as constipation and bloating / wind but I'm really at any wits end as to what to do about the constant gas.
It is non-stop from when I get up to when I go to sleep and gets worse as the day goes on. I have not been to the doctors out of sheer embarrassment so have tried everything under the sun to combat it but can anyone suggest any other remedies or if I go to the doctors is there any medication that can help??
To clarify I:
Do not eat cruciferous vegetables anymore and haven't done for about 1 year
Do not drink fizzy drinks
Do not drink milk
Eat a VERY healthy diet (i.e. No processed foods other than the occasional treat - all my meals are home made every day with meticulous care as to what is put in them to prevent gas)
Take peppermint capsules and drink peppermint tea
Tried taking activated charcoal - made it worse
Take Windeze / Deflatine like they are sweets
Tried probiotics and prebiotics which seems to make things worse
I would really appreciate any help as shy of stopping eating / drinking completely I'm really at my wits end with it all.
Thanks

"I suffer from IBS D which is stress related as I suffer from anxiety. My symptoms are managed with Imodium. I was referred to a consultant at my request, but my doctor warned me that he would probably suggest a colonoscopy which I don't want, not because of the scan itself, but because of the preparation with the laxative powder. I don't think I would be able to go through with taking the liquid. Also other people who have had it done have said how awful that part of it is. When I explained my worries to the consultant he suggested that a CT bowel scan would be easier for me. I readily agreed but when I picked up the information pack at the hospital today, to my horror there was a bottle of liquid meds that has to be taken the day before, which will cause diarrhoea. The consultant didn't tell me that, so I am thinking of cancelling it as I really don't think I can go through the prep. I thought this test would be a straightforward scan. I'm already a nervous wreck thinking about it. Has anyone had this scan done?

Just until recently for one month I have been going to the gym five days a week and eating way healthier then I was, but I'm still costipated and if I haven't gotten any stool out my stomach just feels like I have Togo. When I goto the bathroom I'll spend sometime 15 minutes trying to get just a little bit out and sometimes it feels like I got it all out. And that will relieve some of the pain if I just get a bit out however when I feel like I get it all there won't be any pain. But in hour or two the stomach starts feeling like I got Togo again and if I try and go it's just costipated and I might get a little out or all of it out but it's just so repetitive, it's like this 24/7.

"Hi All.
I was diagnosed with IBS about a year ago now, and I have these bouts of symptoms that I'm linking to IBS, but I was hoping some of you might be able to confirm that this is more than likely typical of IBS. I'll explain what has happened over the last few days so you have a picture of what I'm experiencing.
On Sunday, I woke up feeling ok, then I went to the toilet and my bowel movements were very loose, not diarrhoea, just very soft, loose, smellier than normal and there was a substantial amount. After passing these stools, I felt awful and experienced the following symptoms:
Nausea, feeling lightheaded / faint, bloating / burping, stomach cramps, feel hot but had chills / shivers, a slight feeling of finding it hard to breathe, increased heart rate, burning sharp pain in centre of chest, lump in throat, random lower abdominal pains and generally feeling ill for most of the day, but improving slightly as the day went on.
On Monday, I woke feeling fine and didn't have a bowel movement at all that day, and felt fine. Then this morning I woke feeling ok again, went to the toilet and passed a small amount of quite hard stools, almost like I was verging to the point of it being constipation, however still felt fine after this. A couple of hours later, I had a sudden urge to go to the toilet again, yet this time the stools were as they were on Sunday, loose, very soft, a bit smellier than normal and a substantial amount again. Following this bowel movement I am again experiencing the same symptoms as I was on Sunday after that bowel movement (symptoms mentioned above)
To me it seems to me that the symptoms I get that I have listed are linked to the loose, soft and substantial bowel movements I have. My IBS is alternating, for a few days I can have normal bowel movements and feel fine, sometimes I get constipated but usually feel fine as well, then I get these loose, soft, substantial bowel movements, and I feel awful after them, never before them, always after them.
Are these symptoms I mentioned indicative of IBS flare ups? What could possibly be causing the symptoms? Are there any other IBS sufferers that experience similar symptoms to me? I'd really appreciate your thoughts, views and comments on this.
Many thanks in advance

"I've started to see a massive massive improvement in my symptoms, just 2 flare ups in the last 15 days compared to almost daily issues before. I've got a new less stressful job which I guess is defining factor but I've also:
- cut out all fizzy/carbonated drinks
- eat at set times and sensibly - e.g. No spicy foods
- don't eat any chocolate at all
- get a decent nights sleep
- take one 600mg calcium and 1 strong probiotic tablet with evening meal.
- drink plenty of water or diluted fruit juice
I would certainly recommend the calcium, seems to be several articles online that say it's great. Hopefully this may help someone else!

"Many years ago I was diagnosed with IBS. This past year I was newly diagnosed with diverticulitis. Truthfully, my symptoms with my last bout of diverticulitis felt more like something else..all over abdominal pain, bloated, constipated, no appetite, but the CT scan showed mild diverticulitis. After 7 days of Augmentin, I assumed I was ok. Symptoms persisted (mildly) for a few days, but now...a few days after the antibiotic ended, every symptom has returned and I'm back to square one. I have hirrible abdominal and stomach pain, no appetite and extreme bloating. Although I had a fairly normal, loose BM this morning, it didn't feel like my bowels had emptied. I'm miserable! Can't even stand the pressure of my waistband against my stomach. Also have low grade (99.4) temp, which for me feels like a fever, since normal for me is under 98. I just don't know what to do, besides cry. Does this sound like IBS or not? I also suffer from anxiety and don't want to keep running to the ER if this just sounds normal. Your input is welcome!!

I had severe gas attack and rumbling and I had to go to the loo just for mucus. After am hour went again for bm. Since then feels like I am on a circle. 2 weeks normal then same routine of gas and mucus and bm . I go at least twice a day. Two days ago I had the morning rush after I had to go around 2 am
One thing different is the stool is most of the time neither C or D. It is a normal stool. Has anyone experienced this not having either constipation or diarrhea. But still have all the other shenanigans.
I have watery stool twice a month may be. Constipation never. Now the anus is itchy and burning.

"Hello!
I posted something few days ago but I didn't really ask this question and has been nagging at me for months now. I did make an appointment for my GP on Wednesday. I wanted to get to the bottom of my symptoms because it has been at least 3 months. 
Anyways I was wondering how many you who have IBS suffer from frequent urination? and sorry to be explicit how does your bladder feel?
I don't have any pain and I don't wake up in the middle of the night to go to the washroom. I just get this pressure feeling in my abdomen/pelvic region and it feels like I have to pee. I tried to experiment cause lets face it going to the washroom every hour to hour and a half is annoying so I've been trying to not go washroom until at least 2-3 hours. It is uncomfortable but I can do it. I even lasted the whole night when the last time I went to the washroom was at 8pm and I slept at 1 am.  I am worried that this might be ovarian cancer, even though I am only 18, and yes I do know cancer happens at all ages but at the same time it is a slim chance. Also I'm worried since it is going on with my colon symptoms which I have been told from other posts that it seems like IBS. I also worry that this is diabetes though the only symtopm I get is this; I am not excessively thristy. I also woke up two days ago with lower dull back pain that is still lasting, feels like an annoying muscle ache.
I also would like to ask if I should demand my GP to do the necessary tests? if I should, how should I do it?  Last time I went to her in September I only had constipation symptoms and she told me to up my fiber intake and come back in a month if it persists. I didn't because I wanted to observe it since in the summer I kept coming back to her for a persistent cough that I thought was lung cancer. I was afraid that she would dismiss my worries like she did that time by taking at least two months to request an x-ray of my chest even though I asked for it the first time because it was ""unecessary"" (it was because the cough did go away in the beginnings of september but still if nothing was working from antibiotics to asthma inhaler I would think I would try to see if anything was wrong internally).

"Hi everyone,
So yesterday morning I had a migraine come on. It got a bit worse by the afternoon, and in the evening I ate my dinner, but struggled as I didn't really feel very hungry. About 45 mins after my dinner I started to feel really sick.
I went to the toilet and was a bit constipated and passed a very solid stool. Straight afterward I vomited. I thought it might have been the migraine that made me vomit, as I used to have vomiting very badly with my migraines (although haven't been sick with one for about 7 years).
This morning I woke up and passed more solid stool (like rabbit droppings - sorry if that's too much information), and then passed a couple more stools like this throughout the day. I haven't eaten much today as still feeling a little delicate. I've just had toast in the morning and egg and rice for lunch.
However, just now I had sharp stomach pains come on all of a sudden - went to the toilet and passed a formed stool followed by diarrhea. Now I'm worrying that I've got a stomach bug instead of the migraine causing the sickness. I have IBS so often get diarrhea, sometimes it is after a solid stool.
I was just after some advice though - surely if it was a stomach bug, wouldn't the diarrhea have come on at the same time as the vomiting (which is usually how it happens for me), and that this bout of diarrhea might just be my IBS? Or do stomach bugs sometimes come on like this? Vomiting and then a day later diarrhea?

"Hi I wonder if anyone can help. I was diagnosed with IBS three weeks ago. I have seen my Doctor twice. It is very difficult in my Health Centre to have the same doctor. I have had a very bad time with IBS and looking for some help to cope with this.
I saw my doctor on the second occasion. She thought I was taking Luxido too many times and to reduce it to one every two days. I was also prescribed Mebervine to take 20 minutes before meals.
I do suffer from stress. The problem I am having is very loose stools like diarrhoea and smell really bad despite limiting the Luxido. After an episode like this and I have been on the toilet for a long time. I am absolutely exhausted and have to go to bed. I read somewhere that the bowel can pass a small stool and then very loose stools and then a hard stool. I think it is called overloading. I wonder if anyone can help. I am not sure if it is the Mebervine causing the problem or stress. Also I do not know what foods to eat as I have always had constipation which was ok as I knew to have high fibre food. If this is a different kind of IBS I am not sure what I should eat and what would aggravate the situation. I know stress is one cause but I would be grateful if some one could help with this problem and has anyone had this type of IBS. I have to see my doctor in a week's time and I have to have a colonoscopy. I also suffer from Barrett,s Oesophagitis and acid reflux and I am on Omeprazole.

"Hi all,
I have been diagnosed with IBS-C for a while now, had stomach/digestive problems most of my life. I manage my IBS on a daily scale with drinking plenty of water, taking golden linseed/flaxseed supplements and eating more regularly but smaller portions. It seems to help with everyday symptoms such as the constipation and bloating.
However, since about October 2015, I get these flare-ups where I will start to feel stomach pains, then it feels like my digestion has come to a complete stop and I will become very bloated and gassy, with pain often focused in my right lower abdomen. A few hours later, I will get debilitating stomach cramps for hours on end. It will often change my bowel movements to looser (but not diorrhoea). Recently I have also been wretching and almost vomiting from the pain (but nothing seems to come out...). I have tried buscopan to no avail. I was prescribed mebeverine to try for a month, but I struggle with taking tablets. So my GP has given me another antispasmodic that I will collect next week(the name escapes me, think it began with an A...). However when I asked about the size of the tablet they didn't know what it would be like, so I am in a similar position to before really.
I was wondering if anyone with the same symptoms could recommend something that had worked for them, and if anyone knew of an antispasmodic that has small tablets/capsules.
Would appreciate any advice!
Thanks

"To preface this, we have recently moved to our new residence -- so stress may be a factor here. I have a history of high stress and anxiety, as well as potential IBS and diagnosed acid reflux.
The past few days I have been 'backed up' thanks to the stress of moving, and I simply haven't had the time to actually 'go', or if I did, I gave myself a time limit despite awful stomach cramps. (On either side, in the middle, or in my lower back.)
I've always had trouble with constipation, so this wasn't really new--neither was the cramps or as TMI as it is, the awful smell. No doctor ever really was concerned with it. While I've been having fewer movements, today I noticed both white specks (more prominent) as well as what seemed to be one specific area that had a red speck -- I can only assume it was blood, but it was bright. The stools themselves were normal-colored, so I wasn't all that concerned until I noticed the former.
I've gone from IBS, to anxiety, to worms (I fear I contracted them somehow, even though our pets don't seem to have them and I wasn't in an infested area.), to colon cancer ( My grandmother was diagnosed this year after having awful cramps--you can see this train of thought.) in potential causes -- I was hoping someone here had similar symptoms and might be able to ease worries on anything severe. I'm going to be 18 in a few months, and as far as I'm aware my family doesn't have a history with anything bowel related, so I don't know if I have anything genetic or what to look out for...

"Hi,
So since Monday this week I have been experiencing an IBS flare up. First thing in the morning I will have stomach ache (which is pretty normal for me everyday anyway), but my stool will be soft, then get progressively looser (this is pretty 'normal' for me on a daily basis though), but the problem starts to kick in after about an hour. I keep getting cramps and need to go to the loo. Even though I feel desperate to go, when I get to the toilet I need to kind of strain a bit most of the time for anything to come out. And when I do pass anything, it's only small amounts. It seems to alternate between very loose (almost diarrhea), sometimes it might be slightly firmer (but still not what someone would call a 'normal' stool) and other times it's just mucus. The frequency that I am having to go is really bothering me though. Once I've been, I might only feel comfortable for about half an hour or so, before getting cramps again and having to go back to the loo.
I guess I just wanted to know if this sounds like typical IBS flare up symptoms? Does anyone else experience it like this? I don't think it's a bug, as I think that would be full blown constant diarrhea.
I took codeine phosphate on Monday lunch time, and that cleared it up for the rest of the day. Yesterday I didn't take any pills, but it seemed to settle down in the afternoon and I didn't have any more bowel movements.
As soon as I woke up this morning I was worrying about how my stomach would be...and it seems to be just as bad as it was yesterday morning.
I'm off work this week, so I think maybe the fact that I'm sitting at home fretting about it is possibly making it worse? I suffer from anxiety, so I tend to obsessively worry about things (my stomach issues usually being my main worry). My stomach is on my mind all day long, so I think this isnt helping matters. I'm going to Wimbledon on Saturday, so I'm also panicking that this won't stop before then. I was also trying to lay off the imodium until then, as I didnt want to block it all up, and then have a blow out possibly when I'm away from home for the day.
I do usually take imodium when it's bad, but as I'm at home for a few days, thought I'd try to just ride it out, but it's really getting me down.
I guess I just wanted some reassurance from other sufferers on here that they experience flare ups like this. :-)
Thanks in advance

"Do any of you experience a pretty constant urge to go? For me I always have incomplete evacuation, and discomfort after every meal. My stools are broken apart into many pieces and appear flat. It seems as though my stool get's all seperated through my bowels so there's always pieces in my lower abdomen/rectum triggering the urge to go. Sometimes that urge is weak, sometimes it's stronger. Sometimes my bowel movements are loose, other times I feel more constipated. Quite often I need to strain, at least towards the end of a bowel movement, as little pieces get stuck and there's not enough bulk for them to be pushed out easily. I get some relief after a bowel movement, but the urge to go creeps back in shortly after.

"So I have suffered with ibs for many years. Both Ibs-d and ibs-c though the ibs c is only ever needing to strain to pass pellet like stools and the ibs-d side of things is loose stools. Before I go on I'm going to mention to explain my situation I will need to go into detail.
3 days ago, I got what I thought was a tummy bug as it was more painful than a spell of ibs-d and more frequent visits to the toilet. This lasted 8 hours and stopped after I took one sachet of dioralyte dehydration. I gathered as the D had stopped I'd go back to my normal combination or C habits which is normal to me on a day to day basis. I normally visit the bathroom at least 3 times a day if not more.
But The next day came (yesterday) and I found myself unable to release my bowls even when I was feeling the urge to. This lasted all day yesterday, no movement- a little mucus but that's it. I started getting pain in my lower back and a bloated tummy, (obviously) and also burning pain in my lower abdomen which normally happens when I have a ibs-d flare up. This started happening at around 8 o'clock last night, so I went to the bathroom and tried again but nothing happened.
I woke up this morning with the urge to go and prayed this would mean I could pass something but that was not the case. It's is now half past 5 pm and I still haven't been able to pass anything, each time I go to the bathroom I do pass unrine but I never feel like I need to it just comes out when I strain to try pass stool.
I have never ever gone one day of my life since having ibs, without at least emptying my bowls once a day. So I am concerned.
Yesterday I took 30ml of lactulose to try and help it along but that didn't do anything (which normally does work if I find it hard to pass stool) but this time I feel like there's nothing there to pass, accept I know there should be and when I feel the need to go I feel throbbing inside my rectum and it feels as though when I clench my anus, I can feel a mass within my rectum but it is not stool as I have tried manual evacuation incase im backed up ,after talking to my gp on the phone and she advised that.
So I'm confused as to why I feel something in my rectum/anus when there is no blockage ect and why am I needing to go to the toilet when there is nothing to pass and also why haven't I got anything to pass over the last 48 hours.
So I'm worried if this persist how likely is it that my bowl will explode, and what can be the reason for this type of constipation as I have never suffered with it like this I have always struggled to pass stool but never been entirely unable to! Do I need to visit the doctors urgently? I'm confused as hell and don't particularly want to take laxatives if I don't need to

"Hey I'm just wondering does anybody else experience anything like this? When I have the urge to go I often get like shivers or chills. My skin feels sort of ticklish/tingly with goosebumps. It can be quite annoying sometimes. It's much less noticeable after a bowel movement when I've managed to empty out. Unfortunately though I get incomplete evacuation so rarely do I get full relief. Clothing can be uncomfortable with this problem because they brush against my skin/hair making the ticklish/tingly goosebumps feeling worse. Does anyone experience this or know what it's about? The only other thing I can think of that might be making this problem worse is that I take antidepressants but I'm not sure if that's related or not.

"So, around three or four days ago by the time this posts (July 3rd), we had celebrated the fourth of July a bit early--grilling food and whatnot (keep in mind, this is different from my usual diet -- it's not healthy by any means, but...) , and after eating I became nauseous an hour or so after and was in the bathroom for an hour or so after that -- for once I think I managed to completely empty my bowels, because aside frmo the occasional cramp, I was okay. Anxious as could be due to being an awful hypochondriac and suffering from severe stress alongside that due to the symptoms a week prior, but okay enough.
Since then I've gone three or four days without a 'decent' bowel movement, despite knowing I've eaten well enough to produce one. I had passed mucus, and maybe one stool the day after my sickness, but nothing substantial. I do drink coffee/had fiber over the course of a few days and it has had no effect. I've had cramps both on my lower back (mainly on my left lower quadrant, but it can span to both.), around my naval area, and just my abdomen in general. I don't think I'm bloated?? But I'm never quite sure when it comes to that, due to being partially overweight. ( Embarrassing to admit, I'm not terribly over where I should be, but it's enough to notice. ) 
I haven't been feverish, I don't think -- but I have been extremely stressed/anxious thanks to the pain. Any idea on what to do here?

"My stool is always broken up into pieces. Most of the time they're very little pieces, or ""shards"". Sometimes they're a bit longer but will appear flat, and rough. It feels as though stool moves too quickly through my intestines and doesn't have time to bulk up. This ALWAYS leaves me with the feeling that I could not fully empty my bowel during a trip to the bathroom as pieces of stool always get stuck behind. What can I do to bulk up my stool?

"Hey guys, so I’ve been dealing with IBS symptoms for a few months now. It started in January where I would get sort of clear leakage. It happened for a month straight and so I decided to see my doctor. They did a rectal exam and everything looked normal and a few basic blood tests which came out normal. I got referred to a GI specialist and within the two week period between my initial doctor appointment and my GI appointment, I began to get nauseous and had a feeling of what I call excess acid in my stomach. It lasted about a week and then went away.  I was stressed during that period, which I think exacerbated the symptoms.
At my GI appointment, I explained the symptoms and the doctor he had no explanation, so he suggested a colonoscopy in order to get it done and out of the way as well as to ease my mind. He said the risk for my age would be minimal and suggested he would probably not find anything based on additional blood tests he ordered. Everything came back normal.
After the colonoscopy I noticed a change in stool color, would be dark, then light colored, then pale, then yellow, and back again. Sometimes normal looking and consistency sometimes not. Alternating between diarrhea and constipation as well. Then I asked the doctor for some more testing so we did Liver, Pancreas, and stool tests. All came back normal.
Within that period, additional symptoms came up, such as feeling tired (I slept 16 hours one day), muscle twitching and weakness, testicle (saw a specialist for that and an ultrasound revealed everything to be normal) and leg pain confined to my left side, bladder issues, weird abdominal sensations, weird heart palpitations, acid reflux, excess mucus from nose when having a bowel movement, and a load of others.  Everything took a toll on my life and I was exhausted of having to deal with doctors and pain.
I went on a trip to Mexico and my symptoms were unbearable, I was unable to eat as much as I would like because my stomach would feel full with just a few bites and I was constipated. I messaged my doctor and he suggested we do a barium swallow x-ray (moving x-ray). Everything came back normal.
Here I am today, where a lot of the symptoms have gone down and I’m able to eat more normally, have more normal bowel movements, and go to the gym like usual, but now for the past two weeks I have had a constant headache. I have been taking a lot of vitamins which I assume have helped the symptoms. But this headachehas me concerned. I literally keep thinking I have every type of cancer and now this headache makes me think I have brain cancer. I also went to the ER a few days ago for a really bad cough which the doctors said was probably just a virus and my x-rays were normal.  Do you think the headaches are related to the IBS symptoms?

"Does anyone else find food triggers their symptoms within minutes after consumption? I often get the urge to go to the toilet very shortly after a meal.

"Hello there,
I need advice.  I have IBS which has been giving me a fit lately.  I also have Diverticular Disease, which has ALSO been giving me hell lately.  What I am confused by is the general yucky way I feel.  I can't tell if this pain is IBS or DD.  It is deep and achy... it is under my rib cage, and around  my back.. it's also in various places in my abdomen.  Sometimes the pains get quite sharp... like knives.. other times it's just a general achey nauseating kind of pain.  My intestines feel ""fat"" today... if that makes any sense... can someone tell me if you can relate to what I am feeling?  Usually with DD there is fever.. and i have none.  But the pain is definitely annoying and I am not hungry either... that's another taletell sign of a flare up... but which one is the question...

"So last night we had our 4th of July meal early...you know the works, hot dogs, hamburgers, all on the grill. Stuff like that. I didn't eat all that much, just two grilled hot dogs, and within an hour I was pretty nauseous, and by the end of the night I was in the bathroom for a good hour or so. TMI, but relevant.
Though, it doesn't go without question that I've been particularly stressed over what I'm only HOPING are severe stress/anxiety symptoms, which I'd elaborated on in a previous post--they've left me bedridden and particularly sore, which...just makes matters worse.
I went to sleep with tingling feelings in my hands and that same feeling + soreness in my joints/legs -- a bit weird for my age, but I've had weird symptoms thanks to anxiety/stress before, went to sleep (ie: passed out at 6am), and woke up with a sore lower back, (TMI) excessive 'mucus' down /there/, feeling slightly feverish (though I don't think I have a fever and I don't have means of checking) and just generally unwell, the nightmare that followed prior to waking up not exactly helping me in any way.
What I was getting to was, could this just be a bad bout of food poisoning, or is this the product of a long period of stress/anxiety??

"Today for the first time I noticed bright red stool in my toilet and on my toilet paper. I had a bout of diarrhea when it happened and it definitely looked like there was blood on the stool. I went a couple more times and surprisingly got nothing either time that I could see, but went to the doctor anyway. The doc looked and did an occult test with one of those small pads but could not find any of the previous blood. Not a trace. It's almost like it didnt happen even though I know it did. He did say that he saw hemmies and that could be why, and honestly I hope that's it, but I'm a bit shaken up. Terrified, actually. Has anyone else had a similar experience to this?

"Hi folks,
First of all apologies for yet another post!
Really struggling to shake this anxiety episode, thought I had a grip but hey ho.
Basically my docs and I believe I have ibs. I had a flare up a couple of months ago with the usual symptoms of constipation/soft/ diarrhoea. Slight aches tummy, wind and burping. At the time I was highly anxious but it all seemed to settle down when anxiety eased. But now my health anxiety is high again and I think I'm having another flare up of ibs but this time no diarrhoea ( yet fingers crossed ) passing a bm on average every other day or every day however I often feel like I haven't emptied my bowels fully and so the wind continues plus tummy cramping achey feeling like I've over done sit ups or something..plus feeling a bit bloated too. This has been every day for a week now but last flare up lasted about 3 weeks too.
Had stools tested last time oh and I had a pelvic ultrasound just before Xmas for another issue but that all ok tho the sonographer said she heard a bit of bowel grumbling at the time but wasn't concerned at all.. anyone else have similar symptoms ? Many thanks in advance :-)

"I seem to post on here every time I have an IBS flare up. Last one was 4 months ago. I seem to have had around 4 flare ups in the last 12 month. My day to day struggles with IBS are usually bloating and gas, especially morning time, with feeling of needing the toilet but not being able to go first thing and then usually going around 10ish and sometimes very loose. When I have a flare up I need to go more often, sometimes they're loose sometimes they're fairly normal-ish but I don't feel like I'm fully emptying and this is accompanied with 'different' cramps and light pains in the abdominal area. I had sigmoidoscopy 5 years ago which came back fine but symptoms were put down to IBS so I have been diagnosed with this. I'm 29 and relatively fit and healthy. I suffer with other issues too such as anxiety, indigestion and weak bladder which I have read is often common for IBS sufferers to have as well. I do often worry that the symptoms maybe something more than IBS which doesn't help but I've not seen any blood or dark stools which is reassuring so I just put it down to IBS. I seen my doctor last week and he said the same thing and advised trying to cut out gluten and/or dairy, saying although I may not be intolerant there may be a sensitivity to these food types. If anyone else struggles with these symptoms how do you cope with the flare ups? I've been taken Ibs colpermin tablets which are peppermint oil tablets that don't dissolve until they reach your gut. I think they help sometimes but I've read they can irritate your back passage as a side effect so I'm stopping taking these as of today. I'm hoping this resolves itself in a few days like it usually does but if not I have another appointment with gp booked for next week. Any help appreciated

"I'm 20 years old and male. The only medicaiton I'm taking right now is Zantac for GERD. The only procedure I've had done is an endoscopy that was to see if I had ulcers (I didn't, but I did have mild gastritis and was diagnosed with GERD).
Loud gurgly noises often come form my abdomen, usually accompanied by gas. I randomly feel and intense need to use the restroom at least once a day, but sometimes 2 or 3 times depending on what is going on during the day. Sometimes I will eat a large meal and have to rush to the bathroom only 40 minutes to an hour after. My stools are often pretty loose, and I never have any constipation. My sister has IBS along with a few other digestive problems, and she told me I'm about the age when she was diagnosed. I don't really want to deal with more medication, but it sometimes seems like it's getting worse every week, and I don't know what other actions to take. My diet is pretty good besides salt intake, which should be a little lower. I never change my diet so I have no idea if this is food related or not. I don't consume dairy products as I'm lactose intolerant, and I eat mostly grains, veggies, and fruit.
This is getting increaingly more annoying and it's caused me to not want to go back to college until I can figure out what is going on. I rarely leave the house as well out of fear I will have to rush to the bathroom. I need first impressions, does this sound like IBS or could it be something else? What else do I have to do to rule out other problems? Any thoughts or opinions welcome.
Thank you.

"I'm not sure what kind of help or advice I'm looking for but I really need to share this problem with people who may understand.
I'm 32 and have suffered from IBS for about 14 years. My main problem is bloating, trapped wind and excess gas. Over the years I've learnt what/how to eat to control the bloating and trapped wind. The gas, however, still causes my some really embarrassing problems, especially when it comes to dating.
I don't often meet guys I'm attracted to but recently did meet one. I'm always so terrified of sharing a bed with a guy because of how much I accidentally fart in my sleep. I can spend a whole night trying not to fall asleep because I know as soon as I start to, it's very likely I'll fart.
This leads to impossible situations - trying to stay awake all night and ending up tired or suffering the embarrassment of farting next to a guy I fancy. I've farted a few times recently during the night with this new guy.
I've already read all the advice in the world about foods to avoid to reduce gas. I drink peppermint tea before bed. No matter what I eat, I still can't help farting during the night! A while ago I was very ill for a few days with a flu virus and ate almost nothing for a few days, but I was STILL farting.
I know many people would probably tell me to just mention it to the guy and make a joke of it. I can do that and I'm sure he'd be fine with it. But, it's not just an occasional small fart every few nights (everyone does that occasionally). For me it's usually two or three long loud farts every night! I would totally understand if a guy found that disgusting.
I guess I'd just like to hear from other people who have this same problem. Do you have any unusual tips for how to deal with it? What must guys think to have a girl farting next to them all night?!
I know this must be a very funny post to read. I've laughed while writing it because it is quite comical! But when you're lying in bed next to an attractive guy and you suddenly wake up realising you've just farted, that is definitely NOT funny.

"I was diagnosed with IBS in 2012 (mostly IBS-D) but after changing my diet, I have been able to control the symptoms for the most part, and do not have a lot of issues with it, other than the occasional bout after greasy/fatty foods or alcohol and some bloating.
So, the issue: since 2009 I've been experiencing these stomach ""attacks"". It comes on very slowly, usually around mid morning or noon. It feels like a stomach ache, a dull, gnawing pain, but it gradually gets worse and worse over an hour or so. It eventually peaks for anywhere from 15-30 minutes, where the pain is excruciating -- I can barely stand up, and nothing is comfortable except to lay down or hunch over and literally moan and writhe in pain. I would say the pain is an 8 or 9/10. It feels like my stomach is being twisted, stretched and stabbed. However, the pain always subsides in 15 or 20 minutes and then slowly gets less and less painful over the next hour or so. During these episodes I am completely bloated and look 9 months pregnant. The pain is all over - it is my entire stomach that hurts. For the rest of the day my stomach will still be sore on and off but the pain is no longer excruciating, maybe a 5 or 6/10 pain wise.
Here is where I get stuck: I have NO other symptoms during these episodes. No diarrhea, no need or desire to go to the bathroom at all. No nausea. The only other symptom is I may feel somewhat gassy, but that's it. These episodes don't happen often -- I may go 6 months without one, and then I may have 2 in the span of a month or two. They seem to be completely random. I haven't eaten ANYTHING out of the norm when I get these attacks; my diet is the same as any other day when I don't have an episode. I don't believe it's a particular food because I keep track of everything I eat when I have an attack and I've never found any common foods. It's anever shortly after eating.. if anything it seems to be  a few hours after my last meal. No medication seems to help - Advil, Gravol, Pepto Bismol, nothing. I have googled for years and can't find anything. I've had 3 doctors, none of who can figure it out. They have ruled out cysts, and the only symptoms I've ever seen that even come close are chronic appendicitis or biliary colic, but even those don't seem totally right.
I'm wondering if this is just a symptom of IBS? Is it really just gas?! Has anyone ever experienced anything like this??? It happens rarely but when it does it is debilitating and the pain is unbearable. I wish I knew something that could help.

"For well over 10 years now my bowels have given me some trouble but to varying extents (Now a 27 male). The most obvious thing is that since I can remember going for a number 2 has been a stress - the smell is always terrible, giving the feeling that it needs to be covered up. There is no ""normal"" experience for me going to the toilet where this isn't the case. This causes me anxiety because I always need to plan toilet trips carefully.
Another thing is that while I don't know if 'incomplete evacuation' is quite the right term, I rarely have a sense of total relief when I go to the toilet. There always feels like there is something left there.
On and off over the years I have had minor stomach gripes. After goign to India 2 years ago I had a persistent stomach issue, and following a stool test the doctor said I had some inflammation but that was all he said. It took months for me to start making regular movements.
Does anybody have any suggestions or similar experiences? I should have sought advice on this earlier but I had mostly just accepted it for what it is and found ways to deal with it. But if I wonder if there isn't some explanation which could make things better?
Thanks in advance.

"I have a bit of IBS with constipation per the GI after a clear colonoscopy 4 years ago. I go through periods of constipation and it's tough to go without miralax daily, so we saw the GI for a colonoscopy to check things out and IBS-C is what he diagnosed me wth. I just returned from a 5 day vacation with the family and my habits were different enough that I didn't go poop for a few days. I took miralax like I usually do, but I just couldn't go at all for about 3-4 days until I got home which was 2 days ago. I cleared out yesterday morning and even more today-like even coming to the point of looser stools. Now, I have terrible low left sided pain. When I wipe, it's tender even when I walk. It's not cramping like coming and going, it's like it's just super tender now and movement or straining of any kind (even to pass gas) causes some pain. It's not severe pain, but enough that I'm bothered by it.
Just wondering if maybe because I was so full of crap (literally) that my bowels were stretched and now a little inflamed from it. I have this kind of pain here and there when I am constipated, but I'm definitely not constipated now, so I don't know why it feels so tender.
Or is this just the typical IBS flare?

"I have upper abdominal bloating, plus an accumulation of belly fat after a couple months of high stress. This fat could be high cortisol, or it could be due to inflammation. This is the cause of sudden belly fat. I gained the belly fat while simultaneously losing weight (wasn't eating enough due to stress). I tried to diet and exercise and the belly fat wouldn't budge. All I did was lose fat everywhere else. This is very new for me. I can hardly eat anything without my upper abdomen under my ribs bloating. I'm down to only being able to eating bananas, eggs, and Meal Replacement shakes without bloating. My bowel movements look healthy. They are not as brown as usual, but I think it's because of all of the Raw Meal Shakes I've been drinking every day. I can't decode what my issue is. If I knew, then I would know what I can and can't eat. And how to fix it. Is this IBS? Any other thoughts? These are all my symptoms.

"Hi, I'm a little concerned about some discomfort I am experiencing in my lower right abdomen. 2 weeks ago I was feeling tired and had a slight pain in my lower right abdomen. The pain gradually got worse and by 8.30pm a few hours after dinner I felt nausous. The pain radiated throughout my whole abdomen and around to my back by the time I went to bed at 10.30pm. The next couple of days I felt much better and no longer nausous but I still had discomfort in my lower right abdomen. I have also felt like I have had trapped wind ever since and I very rarely break wind. The only relief I get is when I go to the bathroom and that is usually diarrhea. The last 4 days my appetite has returned and the discomfort is lessening but I'm frightened to eat in case it causes me to get wind or pain again. I have been extremely anxious over the last 6-8 months due to work and life pressures. I am booked in to see my GP this afternoon but I am terrified of doctors/hospitals etc. I'm wondering if this sounds like IBS or something more sinister such as cancer or my appendix

"38/M without a history of any major health issues. Non Smoker, Occasional drinker, moderate cardio multiple times a week at the gym.
About six weeks ago all the sudden I ran into issues with sleeping because my heartbeat became very prominent (not racing) in my chest, head, neck.  It woke me up constantly, as it was quite an annoyance, but it wasn't really painful.  Became fairly tired in the day assuming poor sleep at night.
A few nights of this and then I started also having mild stomach pains and intestine pains in various parts of my abdomen and felt a lot of “gassy processing”, bloating and full feeling (even with little or no food at dinnertime).  My appetite quickly died down and I started to have bowel issues where I was constipated and what did come out just “loose”.  This may be related to stopping my morning coffee thinking caffeine had something to do with my prominent heartbeat; starting caffeine again made me regular again.  About this time I started noticing weak/achy knees wrists.  
Went out of town for Memorial Day, still had little appetite, and after a few heavy carb meals (I ate small portions), I ended up with some sharp burning reflux that required mylanta/pepto.  Those same nights I ended up waking up with cold shakes in the middle of the night.  After this weekend, I actually started feeling better and had a good week (figuring this was over with). Though my joints occasionally bothered me.
After the good week, started back with feeling heartbeat AND stomach discomforts again, especially overnight and in the morning..  This time I started having more muscle and joint pain (arthritic type pain) in the morning.  I also started to have dizzy/tingling spells in my head/neck in the morning and increasing tiredness.  The arthritic pains have now progressed into most of my joints including hands, ankles elbows, etc.
So at this point, I still am having some level of constant stomach & intestine discomfort / heartbeat prominence and really affected by mostly achy joints / exhaustion. 
I’m not sure exactly what is going on, but I’m fairly miserable and barely able to function some days.

"All my life I have had to deal with constipation problems, which is having trouble going poop. Now that I am almost 30 this year in the fall. This week I've noticed some issues at hand here and not sure what to think of them.
Starting this last weekend on June 10th Saturday all the way until today June 14th and still going, I've noticed my stomach hurting really bad, on the lower right side. It hurts when I bend, move, sit, even if I laugh or talk sometimes.
I read up on the symptoms for appendicitis, and I don't have any except the pain hurting. I am not throwing up, no fever, no loss of appetite nothing like that. So I am guessing it is probably me being constipated.
I was able to go poop three times this week, June 10th, 11th, and 13th. But even after pooping my stomach still hurt like it has been. I've taken some stool softeners, eaten oatmeal in the morning, as well as taken some fiber gummy bears.
Yet with each new day my stomach hurts this way and this Friday I have a concert to attend and I am afraid what if I go and my stomach still hurts this bad that I don't get to have a good time at it.
Another thing is that my period is coming up for this month, last month I got my period on May 18th so MAYBE this is all revolving around my period? I also tend to get stressed out a bit, as well as suffer from anxiety and depression, DO NOT TAKE ANY MEDICATION for those either!
I don't know what to do or think. I DO NOT want to go to the doctors and have them tell me bad news, of any kind but have a feeling I may have too. What do you think is wrong with me?

"I was diagnosed with ibs 2 and a half years ago after a first excruciating flare..
I was laying I'm bed and had had cramps which I've always suffered with a long with constipation.
The cramps started getting worse with the bloating, so I thought the best option was to go and sit on the loo.
I went hot dizzy sweaty, in absolute agony to the point I had to strip off due to it felt like I was burning get up like never before..
I was at the point of calling an ambulance as I thought my appendix had burst
I ended up laying on the floor trying to cool down, I was uncontrollably shaking and sweat dripping as well as feeling like there was a hot poker was inside of me. That lasted about half an hour but felt like forever.
My doctor just said yes you have ibs once he eventually called me back.
Well yesterday this happened again but this time I went soooo sissy that I blacked out for what could have only been a split second. .
I'm worried it's not ibs and it's something more serious.
Is this a normal flare up? Am I the only one to have experienced this? I feel alone and worried

"Hi, my boyfriend has been going to the doctor for upwards of three years now trying to cure his stomach pain. They say its IBS but nothing seems to help it and he can't afford the Bentyol or whatever it is they prescribed him. He can barely eat anything, everything hurts his stomach. He can't eat any fruits with seeds or pits (so everything), and the only vegetables he can manage are lettuce and corn. He can barely even season his food without it killing him. He's tried percocets, Tramadol, morphine, T3s & T4s, hydromorphine, everything, but nothing relieves his pain. Every time he goes into the hospital they tell him things are fine and he's had numerous blood tests, ultrasounds, xrays, etc. but still no solution. Sometimes, like this morning, he's vomiting and almost fainting, his body is extremely sore and he can't go to work. He's just started taking anxiety medication and it seemed to help at first but his pain is still so extreme that two or three percocets don't even help. Any suggestions?

"I've had this problem for years now and nothing I've tried to treat it has really made much of an impact. My stools are always broken into many small pieces, and the pieces appear flat. They also look rough, rather than smooth. They basically lack the form of a normal stool. I've found that some foods speed up my bowels, and some constipate me, but either way I still don't feel empty after a bowel movement. A few little pieces get stuck in my rectal area, and I have to strain everytime in an attempt to push them out otherwise I experience a lot of discomfort. Rarely do I get it all out, but at least if I get can just 1 more piece out I feel a bit more comfortable. I know straining isn't good, so I try to reach a point where I feel I did the best I could, and finish...but it sure is hard not to want to strain. The feeling of being incomplete isn't just a sensation either, there really is stool still sitting inside. Often I need to go to the toilet multiple times to get more out. Quite frustrating! I also experience more discomfort after a meal as though the stool already sitting in my bowel has now been pushed closer to my rectal area where I seem to experience the most discomfort. Mornings are particularly bad, especially if I don't manage to have a bowel movement right away.
Does anyone else experience this or have a solution? Thanks.

It is such a terrible feeling. Yes you do Feel as though you are going to die, being scared to death and nothing to help stop this from happening again. It's difficult to hold down a job. I was a school bus driver and yes I had an attack. Thankfully no kids on bus at the time and yes I made it to a bathroom thank the lord but knowing I had to get back behind the wheel and get the children home was just not going to happen for me. Yes I didn't finish out my rt. There's no way I was going to put my kids in a dangerous position because I had a medical issue that was out of my control. That is why I can say it is difficult to work. Difficult to have a normal life. I can only pray that the medical field starts taking IBS more serious! Now that I have passed out I am even more afraid. Yes afraid to eat, afraid to live life not knowing when or were the next attack will happen. Please help us all with this terrible disease.

"Hello there,
Yesterday morning I woke up around 8am with an intense pain up my back passage and around my pubic area. It was so intense that I had to lie back down again, I was in extreme pain. After about 15 mins, it subsided. I then went to the toilet to urinate and pass a stool and once again the pain come back. I found it extremely difficult to do either since the pain was unbearable. No blood, no mucus or anything else. The stool was normal coloured and shaped. Throughout the day, the pain lessened but would prop up again intensely when passing gas. Usually I have one bowel movement a day, on this particular day I had 3.
Today, I woke up and went to the toilet straight away. I passed a normal stool once again with not much pain however there was a lot more pain around my pubic region when urinating. (No stinging from the urethra) just pain around pubic region. I then had my breakfast. About an hour after that, I went to the toilet again however this time it was a tiny bit softer. No less than 5 mins later, I vomited badly.
I've not eaten all day and I've been drinking lots of water. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? The pain is not around my gut or stomach, more around or below my bladder!
Could it be a bug or something I've eaten? Or could it be extreme gas?
Im 23 and a male with no previous health issues or IBS.

"Hi all im looking for some advice on IBS.
I was told by my doctor that i have it around 4 years ago but have never had any tests to confirm anything,during this time my IBS has got worse and i worry that maybe i dont really have it and maybe the doctor has missed something as my symptoms can be so debilitating that i sometimes think surely IBS cant make me feel this unwell?
when it all first started,my symptoms were the odd ""off"" stomach i.e some days i would have trapped wind and cramps and be constipated but it happened infrequently and i could still function normally.
as time has gone on i have had more frequent episodes and more and more symptoms to the point i am at now (and have been for around 2 years now) i now suffer almost all the time and can have constipation,diarrohea,ribbon stools,gas pains,bloating,whole body weakness and aching all over i also feel breathless sometimes and its gotten so bad to the point i had to stop working because i feel so ill i cannot function and feel so weak tired and ill that all i can do is lie down.
these episodes when they are really bad can last over a week and during that time i have no appetite so barely eat.
I am at the point now where i feel so down with it all and feel like i cant be a normal wife and mum as it effects me so much i also feel like people look and think she cant be that bad its only ibs! but it does seriously affect my life.
does anyone else experience it to this extreme? and is it really just ibs?
any advice is appreciated

"Hello everyone i have been a sufferer of IBS for the past 3 years and it is agony for some people and a minor inconvenience for others but i have stumbled onto something which may help everyone effected with this problem, let me explain.
I was having terrible IBS pains and symptoms, so i thought i would try to find a solution to the problem. I have a friend in japan who gave me a very useful tip, in japan they have a routine which can help most digestive problems and i tried it and low and behold it worked. so here it is:
In the morning drink a pint glass of water but dont eat nothing for 45 minutes, you can clean your teeth but no food, once the 45 minutes is up you can have your breakfast and also after meals dont drink cold drinks as the cold fluid gets to the intestine before the food and creates a fatty fluid once the food reaches the intestine, drink a warm drink such as tea.
I know this may seem like a stupid idea to alot of you but trust me this works i started this 3 months ago and havent had any IBS symptoms since, i thought i would post this because of the pain i used to go through i hope this helps alot of you!
Thanks for reading!

"Sorry in advance, this might get a little long.
I went to my GP about 4 weeks ago because I had had abdominal pains for about a week.  I had a short bout of diarrhea at the beginning, and then the rest of the week was just stomachache and some nausea.  She said it seemed like a stomach bug, but if the pains continued I should see my gynecologist to check for possible ovarian cysts.  
When I saw my gyno he said there didn't seem to be any gynecological problems and that I should see a GI specialist.  At this point, I was having a lot of pain and tenderness throughout my entire abdominal area, as well as lower back pain.  The GI doctor told me first of all to stop taking the omeprazole I had been prescribed by the ENT for reflux, because that can cause stomach pain.  He also suggested that stress could be playing a big part in my GI problems.  I stopped the omeprazole and the pain eased considerably, thought not completely.
I've always had issues with my stomach--gas, bloating, indigestion from a range of different foods, and heartburn.  It had been suggested before that I might have IBS, but I was never given a diagnosis.
My pains stretch across my abdomen, low so they actually feel like menstrual cramps much of the time, and I have sharp twinges periodically in different areas--I'll have them in the lower left side, than a little higher in the right side, and then around my back.  I have gassiness and burping, and still have occasional heartburn.  Anything greasy or acidic sets all of my symptoms off.  
My gyno said my symptoms sound like gallbladder disease, but I had my gallbladder removed 7 years ago.  My appendix ruptured and had to be removed in an emergency open appendectomy 8 years ago.  I have a great deal of scar tissue from that, between the main incision and the multiple incisions that they made for the drainage tubes (I had peritonitis from the ruptured appendix).  I've also had 3 c-sections.  The GI doctor did say that adhesions from surgery can cause abdominal discomfort.  As I said before, he also said stress could play a role, which makes sense, because I don't seem to have these types of problems when I'm on vacation and feeling relaxed.  They also subside when I exercise.  
I'm scheduled for an endoscopy, but I'm not entirely sure what that will either diagnose or rule out.  If IBS is suspected, is an endoscopy or colonoscopy more likely to determine it?  I'm also taking lactaid pills prior to eating dairy, because the doctor said that dairy tends to be a problem for many people with IBS.  
I have been stressed out lately and not sleeping well, and not because of my physical health symptoms.  I just have a lot going on and many things that I'm responsible for right now.  My sleep gets interrupted fairly often by me waking up thinking about things I need to get done.  I'm hoping that once school lets out and my kids' regular activities are on a break, I'll be able to relax more and maybe I'll see some improvement in my symptoms.
Do these symptoms sound fairly typical of IBS?  I'm not sure how much I should push for a diagnosis.  If the endoscopy comes back normal, should I go for a colonoscopy as well?

"Hi all,
I recently was told by my doctor that they think I have IBS. My symptoms are that I have constant stomach / abdominal pain which ranges from noticeable but not much of a problem to noticeable and painful. As well as that I am currently constipated and my bowels never feel fully empty. Before taking Buscopan I mainly suffered with a lot of wind, but after releasing it or having a bm I'd be fine.
One day the pain was particularly bad so I took two tablets of Buscopan as instructed by my doctor and whilst it relieved the pain, I haven't had regular bowel movement's since, and if anything, have been constipated.
I wasn't sure if this was coincidence or if anyone else has had this problem also? My IBS is supposedly caused by anxiety which I suffer with and this is a nightmare for me as the pain makes me constantly anxious, the prospect of living with this pain for the rest of my life is nightmarish to me and also I have just finished university and now can't imagine being able to hold a job with this condition.. constantly in pain and not being able to explain why due to embarrassment.... I don't know how people cope with this.
Thank you in advance for your help - I'm hoping having a community of fellow sufferers will help ease my worrying.

About 7 months ago i contracted some virus and after a lot of tests and symptoms i was diagnosed with post ifnectious ibs and also post viral fatigue. I had some bad sinus infections which i think was from acid reflux and i was just wiped out.
Now i am left with gas, pressure in back and some strange symptoms, so wondered if anyone else has had this.
I get a lot of pressure in my head that makes me feel like i have a cold, so wonder if it is tension headaches but it acts up when my ibs does.
I also get a feeling of muscle aches, twitches when it plays up and sometimes feel like my legs are heavy. Also cracked tongue which is annoying.
Has anyone experianced any odd symptoms with ibs like this? Also noticed my glands in neck feel sore when i get pressure in my back. It feels like the gas pushes acid or something back up but i cant seem to find any relief from it.

"Hi I am a 21 year old male with chronic anxiety. I have had severe health anxiety over the past 2 years and the last couple months have been making things worse. It all started when I started to notice that i was belching after eating oily foods and it was a 1 time occurence every couple weeks. Before this I would always eat really fatty foods and never watch my diet without having problems. All of a sudden my stomach started acting up when I ate and caused me a lot of flatuence after meals as well as constipation/diahhera that occured every so often. I went to the doctor after to see what he could do for me and he said he wanted to do a blood test. I did the blood test and my Amylase and Lipase levels came back about 2.5X the normal limit. The doctor said he suspected mild pancreatitis and should clear up on its own. Now the 2 main causes of pancreatitis are excessive alcohol and gallstones. I can tell you first off that I do not drink so we can eliminate that off the list. Secondly, I had an ultra sound of the abdomen and the results all came back normal. The doctor tested me again 2 days later and said all the results came back well in the normal range. I went back a week later just to do another random blood test and everything came back normal again. He told me not to overstress because if it was any worse I would be in a lot of pain but I wasn't really in pain just discomfort in my stomach. This was about a month ago and my anxiety has still been getting to me over the fact that I was told about having an issue in my stomach that the cause isn't known and the stress only made my stomach worse. Now about a month later my stomach has still been acting up after I eat. It is making a ton of sounds that sound abnormal to me but after researching people are saying that its normal to make sounds during the digestive process but mine seems excessive and I can feel bubbles in my stomach like gas pockets moving around.I have come to conclusion that I probably have some sort of food intolerance that my stomach is acting up to. It could be soda,milk,or anything else that could be irritating my stomach which I have been trying to limit in my diet. Just need some advice what you could reccomened me to do. I am tired of going to doctors, its stressing me out even more. If you guys have any advice I am open for it such as a change in diet or something I can take to help my stomach after eating. Thank you for your advice.

It's mostly watery and my anus will burn intensely. I tend to get sweaty and dizzy feeling; and my stomach will also burn. Every time I eat, my stomach hurts and I run to the bathroom shortly after so I've been afraid to eat anything other than crackers and applesauce.
At the moment, I am bloated and my stomach hurts and is tender if pressed on (upper area below breastbone). I keep belching and my stomach is still burning.
I have had this happen to me before but only for a few days. Never this long. I know I need an upper GI and I'm working on getting one but in the mean time, does this sound like IBS? Or should I be more concerned?
Thank you.

"Hi everyone. About a month and a half ago my body started rejecting food. There were days that I would have diarrhea almost 30 times a day. I ended up dehydrated and in the hospital where they performed every test on me and said I didn't have bacterial infection or parasites or IBD. So they slap the term IBS -D on me and let me leave the hospital with Bentyl which did not help and had horrible side effects and Imodium. I've been on Imodium every single day for a month despite my doctor is telling me that it's bad to do so for your body. Can anybody help? I've done everything between change my diet, probiotics and I'm even on anti-anxiety pills now. I have had diarrhea every single day. The cramping and spasms are unbearable.

"Hello,
Not sure if this is the right section. Sorry if it isnt.
I have noticed I have been seeing blood on my stools and when I wipe after sitting on the toilet. This has has been happening ever since I went on a healthy diet to lsoe 25lb. I am now 170lb . I wasn't that fat nor did I have any health issues before, just wanted to tone my body and be healty. Now, my diet is over, and I am focusing on building size/muscle. I changed my diet significantly by consuming at least 2000 calories, 150G of protein.
Still, I am seeing blood on my stools and when I wipe. 
The weird thing is, I am not even in pain througout the day or when my bowels move. Now remember this doesn't happen EVERYTIME. Only sometimes, but I am worried,
I am 18 years old. this has been going on for over a month now, but remember the blood isn't really consistent.
Thank you!

"My GP asked me if I had tried the FODMAP diet, which I haven't, but am willing to give it a try.  However, every article I read about it says you should only follow the diet under the supervision of a qualified nutritionist.  There doesn't appear to be one who specialises in FODMAP in my county, so I've sent for a book.  Has anyone else followed the diet on their own?  If so, how have you got on?  Is it as easy as substituting high FODMAP foods for low ones?   I'd appreciate any tips.

"When I was first diagnosed with IBS, six years ago, I was prescribed Mebeverine.  This didn't really help at all and I continued to have pain and suffer from diarrhoea.  I didn't think my GP would be able to help any further and so just struggled on.  I finally mentioned it to my GP yesterday and he decided to get me to try Buscopan.  I had thought Mebeverine and Buscopan were the same thing - as I knew they were both antispasmodics - but he explained that they were different.
I'm taking 3 10mg tablets a day.  I just wondered if others are on Buscopan and have found it useful.  I know it's supposed to help with the pain, but will this also reduce the diarrhoea?

"I apologise for this being long winded, but I am going totally crazy with worry.  I am 54yr old Female, UK, 7 years post menopause.
 I went to see my GP in April after starting with a lot of strange symptoms in March which I had initially thought were down to viral illness so didn’t want to bother him.
 One of them was a discomfort / niggle (I can’t truly call it a pain) in my left chest area when I for example put my shoulder bag on or carried something (even something very light) but it disappeared when I changed sides.  I just put that down to a little muscle tear (although to try to work out where I may have done something strenuous enough to tear my muscle was beyond me!!).  I started being quite bloated, nauseous, having numerous stool movements a day (I usually have 2-3 but was having 6 or so) all normal consistency.  Dry mouth, random fevers and flushing across my face and an increasing sensation in my left side, tucked under the edge of the rib cage, I would say on a level with my bra strap.
 I also developed discomfort from that same position up the side of my chest to under my arm, and round into my back, up my shoulder blade.  This feels “deep”.  It doesn’t move, it is the same position, and it isn’t gurgling or anything like that, but feels like a fist or a pressure.  If I stand still, for example to chop veg or wash the dishes I end up with a build up of pressure in the back, left side, radiating up towards my shoulder.   Also now if I lift anything – shopping bags etc, then I can feel it build up until it takes over the entire upper back like a burning sensation.  As soon as I put things down it stops.
 Finally, I developed for a period of around 3 weeks really profuse diarrhoea.  I would eat, about 40 mins to an hour later get an increase of the pain in my upper back (bra strap level) and then have terrible diarrhoea.  This settled and went back to normal stool but still around 4 times daily, and all floating, which remains the same now.  I would get woken by this night after night at 4am and need to go urgently for the loo.  I lost 16lbs in this period, was eating but everything just went through me.  I saw my GP – I told him directly that I thought I had a problem with my pancreas (location of the pain, weight loss, Loose stools, etc).  Sent for Ultrasound Abdomen and bloods – all OK other than fatty liver.  So when I did eventually see my GP to get my results he said he thought it could be “atypical IBS”.  We batted this back and to between us for a little while – I said my discomfort is far too high, static, not spasmodic etc and there all the time not just when I have eaten or need to go to the loo.  He has therefore advised me to follow LOFODMAP diet and to have CT Colonoscopy and a Gastroscope but will not hear my concerns that I have something else.
 Has anybody ever heard of “atypical” IBS – he basically said it doesn’t fit the usual criteria?  Can anybody please advise on these symptoms?  I am scared that there is something more serious going on but that he thinks I am being overly worried – and that he has IBS in his mind and nothing will change it.  Also I thought that IBS was the last diagnosis to be reached when other things have been excluded.
 Thank you for taking the time to read and for any help or direction you can provide

"So I've been having symptoms of IBS since I was 12 (I'm 20 now), but no one has been able to figure out that that's what I had since early this summer. A nurse told me that I could use imodium not just for when I got periods of diarrhea, but also as a preventative measure if I knew I was going to eat something I usually react to, or drink alcohol, or be in a stressful situation (which is my main trigger). But then I talked to another doctor online (and no it's not a scam, i checked, it's a legit doctor) who told me that I shouldn't take imodium unless I got a prescription from a doctor, even though you can get it over the counter. I've been taking imodium every now and then since I first started getting symptoms 8 years ago, but after I realized I had IBS, I started taking them more frequently as a preventative measure. I'm just wondering if anyone else here has experience with using imodium frequently and how it affects your system after long-term use? Cause at this point I honestly don't know how I'd get by without it, but I just wanna be sure that it won't make my symptoms even worse if I keep using it too frequently.

"Went through three antibiotic treatments for c.diff and have been ""clear"" of that infection since end of December but have been dealing with PI-IBS ever since (colonoscopy in January ruled out IBD, etc. for causes of my symptoms).
Have been doing better the last few weeks or so aside from intermittent colon pains, rumbling stomach, and persistent food intolerances. My only, main concerns at the moment is a fast transit time resulting in a lot of undigested food and black ""specks"" found occasionally on the toilet paper after wiping (truly hope this is not too TMI).
My stools are normal colored and I never see the black specks on/in the stool, just when wiping. Have heard it could be undigested food (banana, spinach, iron rich foods, etc.), bacteria die-off (would hope not 4ish months after c.diff), or, of course, blood from upper portions of my GI.
Going to call my GI about this but curious if anyone has experienced similar and if they determined a cause. Additionally, do I just accept my new, rapid transit or is there way(s) to slow down my digestion?

Last 5 months it is different and in some ways worse. Last year i decided to go on a diet as i am overweight and was slowly losing a pound a week but when christmas came i put it all back in so don't know whether it was that or because i have had a lot of stress lately with work my aunt dying my stepmum getting bowel cancer and friend died of cancer now convinced i have something serious. Been to doctors 3 times and each time they say it will be just ibs. I have been getting indigestion after eating sometimes. Pressure from bottom. Doctor checked cannot find anything on examination. Pains sometimes stomach area or groin. Doc checked stomach by pressing on it. Have got back pains on right bum and above there. Sometimes worse when lying down. Sometimes relieved with gas. Discomfort under left rib like a balloon there and sometimes tender to touch. Bloating now and then and gurgling noises. Cramp like feeling from back end. No more diarrhoea sometimes feel like cannot go or cannot pass gas. Does anyone else have this. The back pain and discomfort in back just started but i do have piles thought was that but doc thinks ibs flare up. Never been this bad and worried. Thank you x

For example for the past 2 weeks I have had no symptoms but then the day I proposed to my gf I was a wreck with every symptom, the next day I was fine had no symptoms.
So my question is what to I do going foward to help reduce my stress and nerves, what has worked for everyone? 
I havent worked out in awhile cause I tore some ligaments in my knee so its been hard but I am starting to start walking again and soon should be able to work out and run. This is kind of what I think started it all cause I havent been able to workout in over a year.

I have constipation. So this isn't the worst case scenario, but the pain does get intense and kills the moment with my fiance and makes it hard for us to be intimate. We have explored if this could be ovarian cyst related, it isnt. Now I'm wondering if it could be ibs related.

"Here's the deal.  I recently suffered through about 24 hours or so of an attack.  Painful cramping, feeling like trapped gas, unable to ""go"", the usual.  What puzzles me, is, my diet has always been pretty consistent.  I like certain foods, and I do know certain things don't agree with me well, like spicy food, so I generally avoid it.  But I have always eaten bread, dairy, love cheese, and can go for literally months without an attack, then wham!  it hits again.  But why?  I usually look back and realize stress, or a change in my routine, seems to have happened.  So, is it more of an emotional IBS?  Not affected by food?  I also have read the foods to avoid on the low fodmap list.  I adore corn.  And usually it makes me ""go"" really well, which to me, is a wonderful thing, since constipation is my problem when hit with an attack.  I am just confused.

More info >>>
I'm 19 and a student doing a foundation course. After having symptoms of IBS and not knowing what it was for about 6 months I went to the doctor and got a diagnosis. However, on top of IBS the doctor thinks I have emetophobia which is the fear of vomiting.
I'm currently living with family while doing my foundation degree, next year I start my BA degree at a different university and I'll be moving into halls. Having both IBS and emetophobia means I'm pretty terrified of having to cook my own meals because if I eat something that triggers a flare up in my IBS, I'll feel nauseous, which in turn makes me anxious about being sick and then the anxiety triggers my IBS symptoms. 
I think as someone who is very new to this, I just need some advice from people who live with it, because I'll be honest, it's starting to get me down. Any help/advice is much appreciated!

"Hi,
I'm a 25 year old female. I've worked in a GP practice as a medical secretary for nearly a year now and I have become increasingly aware of my health issues. It has made me paranoid.
I have seen numerous Drs with my symptoms, 2 of them say ibs. Over the last few weeks I've had new symptoms like what feels like period pain, even though I am on the mini pill and don't get periods or pain anymore. I have decided to come off the pill all together as I've only been on this one about 6 months and think that it's possibly making me feel worse.
The dr gave me buscopan as mebeverine which both worked for a short time and now doesn't have much effect so stopped taking them. I have finally got the dr to refer me for an ultrasound but I am absolutely teriffied about the outcome. I'm convinced I have maybe ovarian cancer or something. I have always had issues in that area, I had reccurent uti's as a teenager and on and off in my adult life as well.
I'm looking for reassurance as most people pass it off and say don't worry but I'm starting to loose sleep over it and am contemplating paying private to have my ultrasound done quicker. Does anyone know how much they cost? Can anyone advise me or anyone have any similar symptoms? My symptoms include stomach cramps when I first get up in a morning which I've had for months, I then go to the toilet and stools can be loose or normal, they're unpredictable. Last week I had a horrendous pain under my left rib that lasted all day, like stitch, I couldn't stand up and was unable to go to work. Recently, as mentioned above similar to period pain even though I don't have periods. Also, not sure if this is connected but my chest has started to crack when I stretch in a morning, like when you crack your fingers or knuckles. I also find it hard to get a deep breath, like when you yawn and you get the satisfaction feeling. I can't get that and have to try and yawn. I don't have it always but have done for the past few days. I don't have any chest pain with it and had an ecg today which was fine, last year I saw the consultant cardiologist who said he wasn't worried about my heart as it's normally 100bpm on rest but I didn't have the cracking in my chest then.
Any comments welcome, but like I say I'm so worried at the moment and I feel like it's making me feel worse.

Unfortunately, what works for me may not work for you but since she told me that ALL of her patients are deficient in Bs, B12 especially those of us over 60 who may not be absorbing it property, and I did some research on it, I found I have almost all the symptoms of the deficiency.

I'm a 27 year old male.
The last 6 months my symptoms have got worse and worse.
I started noticing feeling bloated but now I suffer from nausea, constapation, very loud guggling noises and a sore feeling stomach.
I can handle all of it apart from the loud noises which are incredibly embarassing in a very quiet office. I feel incredibly stressed and have stopped enjoying work because of it.
I've not been to a doctor yet but will have to asap as it seems to be getting worse.
I was hoping for something you can buy from the counter, any ideas?
Any advice appreciated.
Cheers

"Does any one else suffer their symptoms for 24 hours 7 days a week. I always thought IBS came and went in ""flare ups"" but my stomach seems to ache all of the time. My pain seems to move around but is mainly very low down below my belly button and I am also getting lower back aches, bowel movements are usually fairly normal (very occasional D or C) and not found any particular foods that aggravate it. The only other thing is I am suffering badly with anxiety because of the IBS.

"Hi,
Not sure where to put this. Please move if in the wrong place.
Basically, in around 1 in every 5 meals (including lunch and dinner) I get the following symptoms after eating:
- Very Thirsty
- Extreme Tiredness / Eyes Hurt
- Foggy Head / Difficulty Concentrating (almost as if I am a little drunk)
This is normally resolved by drinking a significant amount of water (around a litre or two over a few hours) and slowly improves. I cannot find any obvious food triggers for this.
I also have IBS, Silent Acid Reflux, Eczema and Acne and I am beginning to wonder if perhaps it is all inter-linked? I am otherwise a healthy, skinny, fit 22 year old with a healthy diet. I do not understand why I have these problems.
I have been tested for diabetes properly by my GP about three times already with the most recent being around 6 years ago. I have also done numerous home tests over the last couple of years and they always come back clear.
I am having a flexible sigmoidoscopy soon and wondering if I should mention this issue to my gastro-specialist next time I see him? Any ideas on what it could be, why it happens and how to ease these symptoms? It's pretty irritating eating something (normally carbohydrates) and experiencing these symptoms. It can make my life really difficult if I cannot get access to water. Throughout the day, I would say I have always drunk significantly more water than average (even as a child) but the thirst, tiredness and general foginess I experience after eating sometimes is on a different level. This has been the case for me on / off for nearly the last decade, but perhaps has got marginally worse over the last few years. Or is this just normal, it is far more common for me after carbohydrate-heavy lunches?

"Hi all,
I am totally new to this forum but have been reading people's diaries during the past few weeks. In short, I have suffered from fissures since about 3-4 years ago. Very rarely back then, but as time goes by one fissure has shown up with a gradually higher frequency. Recently, it would hurt about 1 week out of 4. I am a very fit 23 year old man and have seen a colorectal surgeon last month. He suggested to perform a surgery on it as the main fissure had become swollen and a sentinel tag had been formed.
Last week I had a colonoscopy to determine if there was any underlying cause but all looked fine.
I have been discharged from hospital over little less than two hours ago. I have had today a fissurectomy and botox injection. The diagnosis and treatment are described on the papers as ''Haemorrhoidectomy and Botox Fissurectomy''. The surgeon, very friendly and knowledgeable, mentioned to me that he had removed the senital tag, removed the main fissure and also a smaller fissure/haemorrhoid (the terminology slightly confuses me but everything that could hurt me at this point has been removed).
After the surgery (full anaesthetic) I had no pain... I have some bondage in between my bum which I will remove shortly, they also put some inside my bum which should dissolve or come out during a bowel movement. I have been prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen to take for the coming two weeks, and also morphine tablets to take four times a day. I was given lidocaine to put on the area and also lactulose solution to soften the stool. I was also given antibiotics for the first five days.
I am having some food now and gradually I notice that the area is becoming more sensitive... I will now take my first dose of paracetamol and ibuprofen and will start with the morphine either tonight or tomorrow morning as needed.
Has anyone here got experience with this and with the medication provided? Any advice? I have read quite some useful information on this forum but I guess each situation is different. I am staying home and will be working remotely in the coming two weeks (no work tomorrow). 
I will keep you all posted on my road to recovery.

"i'm a 21 male with history of stomach problems such as Gerd and currently on medication for it.
Last night I was awoken to terrible cramping around my lower abdomen to the point I nearly went to the A&E. The pain was generalized and only subsided when I curled into the fetal position in bed. The pain subsided slightly through the night and I went to the doctors today who said it was a bout of IBS and could be connected to my other issues.
He has given me some tablets to help the IBS, but I have never had these symptoms before nor any symptoms of IBS.
I have had bloating and the pain now only occurs when I move but it is fixed in the lower right quadrant and i'm worried it could be an appendicitis.
I know you shouldn't look to the internet for answers but I have been to the doctors and trust them but I cant stop thinking the worst.
Symptoms i have:
- slight bloating
- pain to right lower quadrant which only occurs when i move, feels like cramp, had it most of today
- Difficulty passing wind
- diarrhea
- when I press the area the pain increases but at this stage the pain is probably 4/10
I don't know whether to go A&E or not, I've had 2/3 tablets for the IBS with minimal improvement. Any help? is this IBS? My grandad also had an Appendicitis.... is it hereditary?

"My pain is severe at times...doubled up unable to walk......starts left upper quadrant travels into my back and across my abdomen. Sometimes I vomit passing wind can sometimes help ease pain. I have been suffering with this pain for years and my previous GP said it was wind trapped in my large umbilical hernia and said to take peppermint!
I've just been to my present gp and he's perplexed as he told me - his words ""there's nothing on that side""
He says I'm tender on right side too and that's indicative of biliary colic.
So, disillusioned I hit the internet and it seems that there is a condition that is recognised in USA called Splenic Flexure Syndrome and it describes my pain exactly!!! I can't find anything on UK sites.
Any one else have any info on this please?
Thanks guys

"Have any of you had trouble with eating white wheat? I have IBS-C. It says it's okay on the low fodmap diet, but everytime I do I seem to get constipated. I had a really bad IBS attack 3 weeks ago. I decided to stay on the low fodmap diet. I started a new supplement called Heather's Tummy Fiber, drank more water and was doing better for two weeks. Then the last few days I've been allowing myself to eat some white wheat bread. Before this I was sticking to spelt bread. I will now stay with the spelt, but I wondered if any of you experienced this?
I'm just hoping I don't have another attack because of my not listening to myself and sticking with spelt instead of wheat.

"Has anyone here had loss of weight with IBS?
I have lost 5 kgs (12 lbs) since I got semonella -can't regain it - most was at the start but lost a couple more hopefully from worrying going to the toilet regularity and eating better foods i.e. Not as much fats as i did before. I do not exercise much anymore the depression has caused me to rarely go walking
So the muscles in my legs have got skinny - muscles weigh heavier than fat so hope it's those reasons. Vicious cycle trying to eat the fodmap diet which doesn't include soot of fats and sugars so I've decided to have a few treats as I don't want to keep loosing weight. It's a hard one.

"Hi
Can I ask who has had a colonoscopy that has ibs - d or ibs with loose stools?
Was anything found and did it make your bowel worse afterwards?
Went to the Doctor today and he's suggested a colonoscopy than having tests for sibo fractose etc. It said it will show any inflammation or polyps.
I hope it doesn't further irritate my bowel and the prep for these play havoc with the gut.
I'm facing my fears and hope after 6 months of loose or small stools that it's nothing more than the PI IBS from the semonella.

"I was diagnosed with IBS a year ago from my GP- I go to a GI in a month to get a second opinoin just in case. My symptoms are pretty much constant, but sometimes they get worse for a time, maybe a month or so. Has anyone else noticed flare ups and do your's end sudeenly or is it a gradual process to get better?
I ask because I've had 5-6 on the Brostol Chart all the time for about two weeks- normally I'm about at a 4, sometimes 5 or 3- and today it's progressed to a 7. While I'm pretty positive it's due to stress from a project at work, that luckily will be ending today, I was just wondering if anyone else experiences this sort of thing?

"I'm 22, and I suffer from IBS. I'm fairly tall at just over 6 foot and I only weigh about 10.5 stone so I look pretty skinny in most other areas which makes this a bit weirder.
Lately my stomach is starting to look like I've got a bit of a gut but the rest of me remains skinny looking however when I prod my stomach there isn't excess skin or fat, it feels quite hard which leads me to think it's bloating due to IBS.
Can anyone confirm this and can anyone give me any advice on things to take or things to avoid to try and stop this. It's become a bit of a self conscious thing for me lately whereas I've always been quite body confident in the past.

I am finding it hard to understand why I am still having diarrhoea if I changed my diet and eliminated anything that could trigger it? Should my symptoms not be reduced from doing this?

"I'm 70 and was diagnosed with IBS five years ago, three years after I had my gallbladder removed.   Initially, the symptoms were pain,diarrhoea, frequency, urgency and mucus.  Now, I still get the same symptoms, but they are more intermittent and, in between times, I get constipation.  
I've been reading about bile acid malabsorption and wondering if this may be my problem.  But my difficulty is the constipation.  Is it possible I could still have bile acid malabsorption with intermtttent diarrhoea and constipation?
I know that my digestive system isn't right.  I always feel uncomfortable and have to go to the toilet after eating - whether it's diarrhoea or constipation.  I've got an appointment to see the GP, but just wondered if anyone had experienced both and had still been diagnosed with bile acid malabsorption after tests.

I'm 13 weeks at the moment and so far have been very constipated, but yesterday I woke up with a really upset stomach and I've been been having really bad cramps and explosive, watery D ever since. I'm very bloated and my tummy feels very tender, and because the cramps just come out of nowhere and leave me doubled up in pain I keep not getting to the loo on time and messing myself.

"Before I start, forgive me for rambling. Understandably, mentioning anxiety, this could go in that forum rather than this, however, I feel this is the right place for me to get feedback. I'm 22, and for about 4 years, possibly 5, I've had issues with my abdomen, an example of some of the symptoms would be, excess wind, smelling pretty bad, abdominal pain, ranging from lower right to upper. This pain increases, as does the off-putting excess flatulence, dependent on my diet, being a student it isn't often the best. The pain isn't unbearable, merely an annoyance, and isn't every day. To add to this, I've been having problems with acid reflux, and what I think is called Dysphagia? Whenever I eat it feels as though food takes a while to go down, this has been the case for a few years as well, also not severe, until recently when I've paid a lot of attention to it, however, this has been improved with the PPI Nexium. However, I do have a distinct pain when I press at the bottom of by esophagus/stomach? I have booked to see a doctor next Tuesday, but as a caveat, my health anxiety has been going wild for the last few days, as it tends to do in episodes, sleep has been hard and I've constantly been thinking the worst, cancer etc so I'd appreciate if anyone could aid me before I see the doctor!

"Hello all. Iv read quite a few posts on this forum, and on probably every other forum about abdominal pain on the internet. If been to my doctor, and my gynecologist, and the emergency room. I have been having pain in my lower right since I had my appendix removed last year in october. I am EXTREMELY gassy, all the time. (This is new to me, I have never been a gassy person) I have dealt with chronic pain before, however, so handling the pain is something I can somewhat manage. I have chronic migraines that I now manage with medicine. For 4 years or so I did not manage them in this was and had 15-20 days in the month where I had migraines. I go days between bowel movements (occasionally this gets better and I will have bowel movements days in a row, my pain is generally better around this time as well).
My PCP referred my to my gtnocologist because she believed my pain was cyst related, she did not looking it further. My gtnocologist also believed it was cyst related at first and placed my on the bar (Which has been hell). This has NOT helped my pain in the slightest. I went back to my gynocologist who did another ultrasound who then told me I was simply extremely constipated and to take milk of magnesia. I did, I pooped, a lot. (Sorry for the image.

"Hello everyone. I'm Jade. I'm 21 and at the moment I'm jobless.
For the past 10 months I have been suffering from serve abdominal pains, very bad nausea, constipation and loose stools and drastic weight loss. I went from 12 stone to seven and a half stone. I have been referred to the hospital but my appointment is not until July. My doctors have not been very helpful what so ever with my situation. Im very stressed/depressed and constantly anxious which I know will not be helping with my symptoms. What made me write on this forum tonight is because my symptoms are getting worse and worse as the days go by. I'm extremely poorly. I had to quit studying due to this problem. Now I sit and home all day everyday twiddling my fingers. There is so much more to life than being miserable and not being able to do the things you'd like because of your health.
Let me tell you about my diet.
Before I got these problems, I didn't have the healthiest diet (I was young enjoying myself at uni) as soon as I got these symptoms I changed my diet. I was eating bland food for about two weeks. Symptoms did not go away. It doesn't really matter what I eat, I find I'll still feel sick and get bloated after anything I eat, so my diet now is balanced. I stay away from peppers,broccoli,cabbage,onions,tomatoe, dairy (as much as possible) and spicy food as I know these can be major triggers for my symptoms.
I have had many blood tests, urine tests and stool tests. Which came back okay. I also had an ultrasound, which again, came back normal. My hospital appointment in July is for a endoscopy and maybe a scan of my abdominal.
I appreciate anybody taking their time to read this and get back to me. I just need some advice. I'm really desperate. I can't go on like this any more.
Thank you

"Hi, I'm Chris, I'm 45 and I can't cope.
This is my story.
I Have suffered with various stomach grumbles all my life. I have never been a sick person (only physically sick once from a bug in 30 years) but always had bloating, uncomfortableness. Paid many a trip to the doctors but it was always Gaviscon or more lately Omeprazole. I must also point out I suffery from acute anxiety, OCD and depression. Not on any meds though at the moment.
Anyway, towards the end of July, after eating out a lot over the course of the month, my stomach started to feel off. No pain, no sickness but just off. Then I had some bad cases of instant intestinal discomfort followed by a quick dash to the toilet and a bit of a mess in the bowl. This happened several times. Also, when my toilet was not runny, it was Tan in colour, nearly mustard. I went to the doctors, had a full bowel physical inspection and full bloods done. All ok. Had a week away in Cornwall, apart from one ""Dash to the toilet"", everything calmed down apart from the colour was still lighter than usual. I went back to the doctors as they had put my on Sertraline for my anxiety but I had stopped taking it. I had another bowel inspection (different doctor), I explained my yellow poo but he said I was not saying anything that rang his alarm bells. No visible blood in stool, no constipation, no diarrhea. Just this horrible yellow poo. He made me an appointment to see a Mental Health specialist. I went away, felt better. I started to change my diet (I was 14st 6ish, 5ft 10). I was drinking coffee and tea all day, 1 large sugar in each, up to 15 cups. Snacked on biscuits and was getting little exercise as I am currently off work long term for an ankle injury. I cut milk out, bread, all sweets and cakes etc. I had to go back to the doctors for a follow up, this time my wife came with me as she cannot cope with my anxiety. I must say, thtoughout all this I have been so anxious and stressed. I spent 22 hours straight googling cancer, making notes. I googled 2700 websites in 48 hours. Cancer is in my every thought. I cannot have a second in the day where I'm not thiking about it. 
The doctor explained he could just start sending me for tests but with my personality I would never be happy, first Endoscopy, then I would want a Colonoscopy, then if they came back clear I would switch to liver. He is right about that, with my current frame of mind anyway. 
So, on top of all this I started weighing mysef daily starting about 3 weeks ago. I was (naked on a pair of Tesco own digital scales about 14st 6). 
Over the last week I stepped up the exercise, just walking. Walked about 28 miles this week at a good pace. I have no problems with walking, I have no energy loss or fatigue and I'm a healthy colour. Actually I'm fed up with people telling me how well I look. Now several days last week my poop changed. It wasn't perfect (to me a hard walnut brown is perfect) but it wasn't the mustard colour it had been. And I go regular, always between 5.30 and 6.30am. Weighing myself daily I noticed weight loss. Now normally I would be over the moon but no, my head just linked straight to cancer. I would weigh myself over and over. Now yesterday I went to the toilet and it was a proper stool but it was light, I instantly started to sweat with fear. That was it, my day was ruined. I spend the whole morning (even though we were at an exhibiton) crying inside. I was overwhelmed with feeling of (no one believes me, not even my wife). We went for food, we came home, I had to pop to the loo again. It was just a small amount but it was yellow and floating. ""Malabsorbtion"" my brain keeps screaming. That would explain the weight loss!! I started to goole and ending up spending 6 hours moving from forum to forum looking at bowel cancer stories, trying to find people with similar symptoms. I didn't though. It seems the compete opposite to yellow poo is one of the most noticed fisrt symptoms of bowel cancer but I get no relief from reading that. So anyway, I have weighed myself this morning and I am 13st13 naked. My head started spinning, I can hardly breathe. Cancer Cancer Cancer is all I can hear. I just can't cope with this. Fast weight loss, yellow poo. What can I do now? I'm even frightened to go to the toilet as I already know it will be yellow.

Another bad night, the first in a few weeks so be thankful for that! This is really just a sharing post, I don't think any advice would help as I've tried nearly everything over the years. Of course, if anyone has found the magic pill, please let me know!
I took my usual ""helpers"", constella and 25 mls of Pico liquid about 7 hours ago but they aren't working as they have been doing for a while. I'm hoping this is just delay but it's not possible to avoid the fear that nothing will work ever from now on irrational as that would sound to ""normal"" people. You have to go thru it to really understand.
That's it really. I have found it helps to have this forum and to know that you are not alone.

I am now on my second Gastro consultant who still has no idea what the problem is. CT scan, ultrasounds, Gastroscopy and Gastric Emptying tests have all been normal. The Gastro doc has now told me as the tests are clear he thinks it's IBS. I told him my bowels are normal so it can't be that but he insists it is.

"So I'm an 18 year old male and I've suffered from severe IBS for almost 3 years now, but it has got worse in the past few months and seems to get worse as each day goes by. I have cut all gluten out my diet and most dairy out my diet and try and do a reasonable amount of exercise each day however I still end up with stomach cramps and constant trips to the toilet; I'm talking 6 or 7 times a day usually with bad wind and either loose stalls or constipation. I find I feel I need to go urgently about 5-10 minutes after every meal, which is turning into a problem as it is stopping me from working and making me miss my bus everyday. I need to go about 3 or 4 times before I leave my house in the morning in order to feel partially empty and still I'm not.
This is stopping me from going out, I can't stay doing friends houses or overnight anywhere as it's too embarrassing and no one truly understands. I've tried different probiotics for a few months but neither had any effect on me at all.
I'm begging anyone to help me with a solution for this or some help! I just want to stop these constant trips to the loo and stomach cramps and feel human again, especially as I'm supposed to be starting university in September after putting it off for a year to try and resolve this!
This is really effecting my mental health and making me extemtly down because of it, and it's very difficult to talk about as not many people truly understand how it feels. I've been to the doctors countless times who don't really care and say 'just follow the diet your on and relax more', which isn't a permanent solution as it doesn't stop these toilet trips or pain. I've had a colonoscopy and it has ruled out Crohns or Ulcerative Colitis or any 'severe' conditions, which just leaves IBS.
Any help would be much appreciated! I really need this all to stop so I can finally go to university and live my life without all this anxiety and pain everyday, otherwise I don't know how I can go on with this.

"Once again.. pain
This time it's in my lower abdomen where I'd think my ovaries are.. burning.. bubbling.. moves to right side too.. from side to side.. feel nauseated.. my sides and lower back hurt too.. I'm not sure if that's related though..
This type of pain has happened before and was most likely built up gas but I'm scared it's my apendics which is making the pain worse as I'm getting stressed about it, it feels like period pain but with bubbling feeling.. it hurts like hell
All I've eaten today is a chicken roll, tuna mayo pasta and water.
None of these are triggers accept occasionally pastas but only when I eat large amounts which I did not.
So I don't think it's food related but I'm trying to justify the reason why this pain IS my ibs and NOT appendicitis but my mind is so weak I'm struggling to not have a panic attack .. so my symptoms are
Burning , bubbling , full period like pain, coldness feeling of back middle (above hips below rib cage ) and aching pain lower back just above tail bone either side of the spine , and nausea and wind

"Hello, a few days ago I had pizza in the evening, then imediently afterwards I had the worst stomach pain of my life. It kept me up all night and it feels like I have a knife in my stomach. I started throwing up and coughing up blood and having diarrhea. It ceased by morning, and then that evening I had a steak and some potatoes and i was fine. Then later that night I had a burger and fries and the process started again by waking me up at 2 am and not being able to sleep again because it was so painful, then I was fine by afternoon the next day. I have been too scared to eat, and I have not done so in two days. Any idea what this could be? I've already begun to get lightheaded and very fatigued because of me not eating. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

"Been to the doctors 4 times now and no definite answer to what I have, although he suspect ibs.
My symptoms are Bloated stomach and when I eat it goes even bigger as if I'm pregnant (I'm male btw). I did have acid reflux which the doctor prescribed me with some pills that I took for a month and stopped the acid reflux ever since. I did a h pylori test via stool sample but it came back clear.
This week I had 4 blood samples taken as the doc wanted to check for H pylori again! Plus some other check. He said if it comes back clean then I may take a colonoscopy.
The only symptoms I have right now are..
-Bloated stomach (had it for nearly a year)
-No hunger pains like I used to (but I do eat anyway)
-3kg weight loss. (altho I'm constantly ill with common colds, flu, viruses which don't help)
-stools sometimes softer than usual.
-excess mucus in throat, sometimes makes me gag
The acid reflux stopped altogether, it was bad before. I stopped eating 4 hours before I go to bed, so that probably helps.
I am in no pain, no blood in the stools.
Help and advice appreciated

"Lately, I have been using an herbal cleanse when I get that bloating feeling that is so uncomfortable. I feel like there is something stuck in my upper esophagus and lower intestine.    The only way I get relief is a herbal cleansing tea or herbal laxative tablets. I feel so much better after the cleansing. I don't want to become dependent on these cleansings and I know I'm not supposed to do them continually. Has anyone tried this for relief?

"So I had like 4-5 days of bad sleep/stress, about 4-5 hours of sleep. Before I had a mild concussion with caused like 10 days of recovery, which was about 3 days of bad sleep as well. The day after the 4-5  days of bad sleep I was wearing tight pants, ate hot wings, pizza, later that day got heartburn. It lasted for 2 days and a half. The days heartburn was gone I felt like I got a lump or tightness of throat when eating(Might of been something in my head).I got regular sleep after the heartburn, about 7 hours The next day I tried to eat more from losing some weight, some pork, felt acid digesting, a little sting like. I was fine afterwards. The day after I tried to eat more, and next I eat some chile with cheese which was not too spicy, was fine after that. But the next day is when I started having a tough time digesting food/bloating/felt like food stood there. When it was fully digested I felt fine agian, taking about 5 hours or so. Sometimes waking up in the morning feel like throwing up but nothing coming out, feeling like harden food in upper stomach but only sailva coming out. My stomach feels bloated/doesn't digest/just sits there leaving me in discomfort. I don't feel any pain, burning, no more acid reflux. My stomach also makes growling noises a lot, I have pooped less recently because I can't consume much. My poop has came out normally but far less since i'm eating less, I never have diaherra or problems pooping but don't poop as much anymore because I don't eat much anymore. I don't think I take more than 5mins in the bathroom but then again I don't produce much either. I know it can be low stomach acid or just bad enzymes in my body but I want to be sure. 
My symptoms- Bloating/Food doesn't get digested/Growling noises in stomach

"Hi
How many of you have unrelenting gas wind or burping too when eating food?
I am on the fodmap diet - not really changing things with my stools. I long for the day I have a decent solid motion. Sorry for the graphics. I do hope it is just PI IBS - it all started 5 months ago after the semonella poisioning. Can only hope it's that.
Also sorry to ask but can floating stools apart of IBS - been having a lot lately.
Also I'm now wondering if BBQ steak agrees with my gut? Keeping a food chart and that's the only thing jumping out.
Thanks guys for any advice - this forum is a good place to come and hear from people suffering with gut and bowel issues.
I have tried Metamucil too to try and bind my stools I have one day where it was the most normal in 5 months but still a little to go then bam the next day kapow - back to loads of small floating stools. Made me anxious again wondering what the hell did I eat even though everything is on the fodmap diet I'm eating.
Has anyone tried digestive enzyemes? I've been on probiotics for a long time and just wondered if I should give those a go?
I also have a herbal product the chemist recommended for Ibs which ill try.
Cheers

"Hi!
I've been bloated for over two weeks now. I ate something I shouldn't have - I believe dairy is not a no-no for me (though is never was before) as well as artifical sugars (I had swedish berries =[ ) .... So i was bloated for a week, had my period so got double the bloating, my periods over now and usually my bloat is gone - but my stomach feels off and bloated still from im guessing dairy products. 
It's really fustrating always feeling and have an extra large stomach - I go to the gym still every day - It's still hard to resist dairy and bread so I don't think i'm doing myself and favors not cutting these foods out 
Has any medication helped anyone? I've taken Acid Pills for the first time a couple days ago, it didn't seem to really do anything. 
Any help would be much appreciated!
Im 23 - have had IBS/ stomach issues since i can remember - but i've never had an IBS bloat attack this long (the only other time was in 2016 for a week due to spicy food)

"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to read my post, really appreciate it.
I'm 27 and I've been dealing with bowel issues now for around 5 years, and it seems to be getting progressively worse.
I can't eat anything without feeling bloated and nauseous, regardless of the portion size or content.
I fluctuate between diarrhoea and constipation, there's never a middle ground.
It's affected my sex life in particular, severely, and thus my relationship with my long-term girlfriend. I have no desire to have sex because of consistent nausea. Sometimes i force myself to, but i'm never comfortable.
The only relief I have is when I fast, and even then I can't reach back far enough to feel regular again. I'll go without eating for 24 hours and I'll still feel the same discomfort in my gut, albeit slightly lessened at times.
My question is, is this a normal situation to find myself in when suffering from IBS? I'm also in the process of being tested for inflammatory bowel disease.
Thank you!

But I just noticed how slow my food is to digest and think it's low stomach acid rather than excess stomach acid.

I have been at reliving stress now coming back to my sleeping schedule for about 6 days now. The day I got heartburn, caused by tight pants, bad sleep, stress, hot wings, pizza; which was from one of the days I had bad sleep, caused acid reflux for about 3 days. After that I didn't feel it but everytime I ate it causes my thrroat to feel tighter or sometimes a lump, as well everytime i eat I feel like butterflies, moody, almost like depressed. It happens everytime I eat, lasting a couple hours. Also everytime I lay down or when I sleep I wake up feeling like butterflies throwing up.

"Hi guys I'm new to this forum and I figured I'd try it out to relive some stress. Over the last couple of months I have felt very irregular. I make sure to eat healthy everyday and balance a healthy diet. I have also cut out soda and junk food for the most part. When my bowel issues began I felt the urgent need to use the restroom and would have to rush to the toilet with very little success only passing some gas which did make me feel a lot better. I have ran into some instances where I almost couldn't control my flactulance which would be super embarrassing. As time progressed I tried to ignore it and I figured it was just IBS or something I ate. More recently I have noticed that I am very constipated with very little success at the toilet and going some days without a bowel movement all day. When I do go to the bathroom I would have to force it out and I would have very odd shaped stool after I was done. These bowel movents of corse worried me and made me go into a google frenzie. Through my research I found that I share similar symptoms of what sonone would have if they had colon cancer. I am an athlete but lately I have been feeling very tired and sometimes feel like I am not getting enough oxygen which can be a symptom of anemia (also a symptom of colon cancer) I went to see my doctor but I do have a history of worrying about my health a lot cause I am known to be a hypochondriac but I can physically see that things are not okay but no one believes me. My doctor told me to eat more fiber and drink plenty of water to get regular again but I have already been doing that on my own and it hasn't changed a thing. I have noticed that my stool is dark but I'm not sure if I'm just overthinking every thing cause I'm stressed out. I want to get tests but the doctor told me to wait a month and if nothing gets better then he'll order tests. I'm just so scared if I wait longer it will be too late. Someone help please I'm at my wits end. Thanks and sorry for the long post.

"Hi all. I've been having digestive problems for 9 months now. I mostly get a bloated feeling in upper left quad and a kind of pinching feeling in the middle left of abdomen. These come and go in severity but i can always feel a low level discomfort. Always feel like I need to go the toilet and always have diarrhoea in the mornings. Aside from that, I constantly feel tired and have itchy skin.
I've had all kinds of tests. Had a dual phase ct to check pancreas, liver and rest of abdominal organs. Had mrcp and endoscopic ultrasound. Endoscopy to check stomach and abnormal ultrasound as well as a barrage of blood tests. Docs have said I have ibs but it's a difficult diagnosis to accept. Going in for a colonoscopy in April. If that's fine, I'll accept the diagnosis. Just looking for a little information on how this syndrome affects people.

"So to start with I'm going to warn you I will be some what open about certain things and it may be a little TMI for some. So be aware.
I am a 21 year old female who has suffered on and off with ibs since diagnosed at 10.
I am some what active, eat a some what healthy diet currently and am on a mixture of medication for ibs symptoms and mental health issues.
In the beginning, my symptoms were just slight cramps when I'd eaten greasy fatty foods, after visiting the doctor I found out it was due to ibs and I was put on mebeverine tablets 3 times a day and cut out all fried and heavily fatty foods. For about 2 years this helped my ibs subside and I thought I was misdiagnosed and had gotten better.
I kept up the restrictions and water intake and carried on the medication through out, needles to say after about 6 months I began expierencing bloating when eating bread, pasta, potatoe and rice so decided to reduce the amount of these foods. Things got better and I was able to eat them normally again, things stayed pretty calm for the next 3 years untill I was between 15-17 when I had a major flare up and passed out from the pain, ended up needing an ambulance and they suggested I try buscopan for the pain. After that one incident the buscopan seemed to help the cramps and burning subside but I also had anxiety stress added on top of the the food I couldn't eat. it took another 8 months for tfor my body to get back to normal and things were once again OK for a short period of time.
Then roughly 2-3 years ago including this year I had another flare up, same thing happened accept I was taken to hospital and given a suppository for the pain and sent home and advised ibuprofen and buscopan once again.
After this I started to realise not only could I not have fried fatty foods, but my stomach couldn't handle butter, milk, yogurt or cream. After I got to talking to a friend that too suffered with ibs I decided to visit my doctor, to which he suggested the foodmap diet. I completed the trials to no avail, there were no solid triggers as foods would affect me in different ways sometimes than others and once again I decided to visit my doctor. At this point (the middle of last year) if got to the point where I was near on ready to give up (or so I thought) my symptoms at this point were more, cramps, burning, bloating, acidic nausea and the defecation problems known to ibs (which is never expierenced before) most of the time being IBS-C. I tried to eat more fibre and drink more, herbal digestive supplements and a strict time table for when to eat. I joined a local gym ( as the doctor always advised exercise would help) but this had no affect. I am now currently paying for a gym membership I cannot use due to anxiety and unpredictable ibs flare ups and toilet habits.
This year I've been to my gp and asked for blood tests for things such as celiac desease,gluten and lactose intolerance and general food intolerances as well as the normal things they check such as thyroid . All came back FINE. I had lanzoprizole added to my daily medication which seemed to help with the bloating and helped me release built up acidic acids but after a while they no longer helped even with a higher dose. Last week I was given ibs relief peppermint oil capsules and had my lanzoprizole changed over temporarily to ranitidine and have been told to make an appointment for a c13 breath test to test for a bacterial infection in my intestines.
I am in so much pain, feeling bloated constantly and never feeling saticfied after a bowl movement.
I am now combination ibs with bouts of constipation and diareah and most days go between the two. I go back and forth to the toiletat least 5 times a day and haven't had a bowl movement that I haven't had to strain for in over a year.. in the consequence of this I now have hemeroids which make things even more painful and a lot of blood loss from both external and internal. I have recently got a cream for that which helps the pain a little but makes no difference when I'm constantly irritating them when needing to go to the toilet.
I struggle to eat because I feel sick from being bloated and am currently living off of water,activia yougarts and oat and seed cereal bars, I cannot eat a ""meal"" not even ""little and often"" and I'm afraid if I have stool build up, it might affect my appendix which is the last thing I need as my health anxiety hypochondria chose appendicitis as my biggest fear.
As many of you will know yourselfs these situations affect you physically and mentally, I already have diagnosed mental issues such as depression and anxiety disorders but this disorder is ruining my life..as my anxiety progresses my ibs stands in the way of me going out for self exposure purposes, and when I feel I CAN go out and am mentally prepared my ibs has completely different plans.
My life is pretty restricted due to My
Anxiety disorder without the added stress and symptoms and pain from ibs.
I just don't know what to do now..
ANY help would be appreciated and I thankyoufor reading

I have had stomach issues since I was a teenager. The only time I haven't suffered is through both pregnancies.
Recently I just have no let up from my symptoms. I suffer loose bowels and I can go between 8 and 10 times before leaving the house to take my boys to school. I experience a lot of stomach pain. I get nauseated. I take buscopan everyday and also rely on loperimide.
I do suffer with chronic anxiety too. This I know does not help.
I just can't stand the constant stomach issues. I am so desperately unhappy. I have no social life at all. I can't even cope taking my children out. My diet is becoming more and more limited. I avoid so many foods and most days sit wishing I didn't have to eat. I stay home most of the time. Getting the boys to and from school is so hard every day.

"Last Late October I contracted the worst case of semonella - involving severe diarrea for over 7 days (no vomitting - apparently its better if you have that with it) for which I was given Flagyl which didn't stop the diarrea until I took Gastro stop.  The diarrea stopped then but since then I have never had a normal bowel motion - well what I always had - to be quite descriptive - not a solid motion.  I have gone through different motions along the way - lately more like pencils shape but feel like I'm passing something huge - now it is slowly getting a little more solid but never one solid piece, but still not normal.  (By the way my stool sample did come back as semonella).  I went back to the doctors after the results came back as semonella which was about 2 weeks after i'd initially had it and i had told him that I was still not going normally and he said I would probably have IBS.  He said I could of gone on a tablet (to be approved by Canberra) called C Flox and that it might help but the side effect could be tendon damage - just what I didn't need - but he couldn't guarantee it would help at all.  I did not take it.
 Prior to getting this I was under enormous stress - my sister had just been diagnosed with cancer and my mother was ill.  Apparently another reason why PI IBS has hit me hard - as anyone with stress prior to an outbreak is more affected.
 My nerves have gone down hill as it's very upsetting being anxious to go to the toilet and hoping it will be as it used to be.  I lost 9 lbs in the 2 weeks I suffered with the poisioning and of course worried about that.  I have adjusted my diet somewhat - trying to keep away from diary, eating sourdough or gluten free bread - and not eating sweets as much.  I make my own treats with all dried fruits coconut oil cacao and coconut and that helps with my sweet fix.  Also have sea salt dark chocolate.  I have not gained any of my weight back - another worry but then I guess I'm not eating quite as much.
 I take a probiotic which helped a bit in the beginning - cut down my bloating alot but have recently had the bloating again - probably nerves not helping.  As my stress levels are still high - I decided to go on anti depressants (which I'd tried twice - once during the poisioning (wrong wrong time) and when i thought i was getting over it (still couldn't take it) but now have persisted and even though getting nauseous and feeling shocking, I know for my own health sake I have to be in control of my nerves.  You get to thinking you have cancer as this ibs makes you feel so tired and unwell.  It's very emotionally draining.
 So that is my story - I don't know if anyone can relate to the symptoms I am having - I'd love to hear if they do - if nothing but to make me feel I'm not alone with what's still happening to me.
 I feel for anyone going through this.  It's terrible.  Cheers Rhonda (from Australia)

"I am 24 years old and was diagnosed with IBS about 3 years ago, which manifests mostly as stomach cramps and acid reflux. I am thin but have a constantly bloated stomach, and often feeling nauseous prevents me from eating. In the last six months or so symptoms have got worse, and I have identified two situations that make it much worse:
1) Work. My mornings are usually fine, but around midday I need to go to the bathroom. I am very embarrassed about the condition and in my office the only bathroom is no less than 5 metres away from everyone's desks. I simply can't use that bathroom, and so the afternoons get worse and worse as I am in increasing pain and discomfort. My concentration and standard of work declines. I can never go to the bathroom in the morning while still at home, and don't tend to eat breakfast as it makes me sick. 
2) Love interest. There is a guy I really really like who I spend weekends with every month or so, but every time I have spent time with him recently, I have been so stressed about not being disgusting around him that it causes me severe constipation, and extreme pain that ruins everything. Last time I went for a whole week without using the bathroom as a result and honestly experienced pain akin to childbirth when I could finally go again. He is amazing and would never have the slightest qualm, but I just cannot use the bathroom around him like that. It is just too embarrassing. 
On top of this, I have serious depression for which I am quite heavily medicated, and the stress of feeling sick and not being able to use the bathroom for fear of embarrassment makes the situation so much worse.
I know at least the work issue would be mostly resolved were I able to use the bathroom in the mornings, but at this rate, it will literally mean getting up everyday at about 4am just so I can use my own bathroom and rescheduling my entire life. I am feeling so stressed and overwhelmed by this right now and refuse to wait several weeks for a doctor appointment when I'm already on medication and they are probably doing all they can as it is. 
Sorry to rant. Can anybody relate to this or suggest anything that might ease my problems? Thank you.

"Hi,
So I was diagnosed with ibs c last year with my worst symptoms being excessive gas, nausea, constipation and blood from back passage. Was referred to hospital and had appointment this week.
Was told that above symptoms were caused by being constipated and was advised to drink more fluids and take Linseeds with breakfast. Also if this doesn't work, then try laxatives.
Have tried above and also trying fybrogel which has helped me become more regular. But I still feel I'm not emptying bowel properly and this is still causing me problems and I am still getting above symptoms. I was wondering if anyone knows how I can make my bowels empty fully. Seems like I empty so much but there is stuff left and can't seem to shift it. My stools seem soft but as a result are not evacuating fully and this is causing problems. Is there a way to make them more firm so they evacuate fully rather than partially? Thanks!

"I suffer IBS and used to have really bad bloating cramps and usual symptoms with IBS, but a few a weeks ago I started eating sourdough bread the white sort and the difference it made to my symptoms no more bloating and guts in general much improved, sourdough bread is fermented the old traditional way of making bread where the lactobacillus probiotics ferment and digest the wheat and gets rid of most of the phytic acid, so just wondering if anyone eats sourdough bread and has experienced any benefits.

"About 7 weeks ago I came down with what appeared to be the stomach flu. No vomiting, but I was bent over the toilet the first night because I was positive I was going to. I was in and out of urgent care, ER, etc. and told that I had gastroenteritis. They gave me an anti nausea med and sent me on my way. I had extremely watery frequent diarrhea for about 4 weeks. At that point I saw a GI who prescribed a probiotic (Align) that I have been taking every day. He told me he thought I had infectious enteritis and that I would get better. Soon after that, I started to gradually feel better but I wasn't back to my old self. During the first few weeks I was unable to eat most of the time and dropped 30 pounds in a month. Once I started eating again I gained about 10 pounds back, but I still wasn't really able to eat full meals. Not sure if I had a lack of appetite or if I was just afraid symptoms would return. I wasn't having watery diarrhea anymore, but my BMs weren't as they used to be... They are now more frequent, and usually alternate between very soft or pebble like and annoying to pass. A few days ago I went to the bathroom, had a very soft BM (very close to diarrhea) and noticed there was bright red blood on the tissue when I wiped. None in the toilet or my underwear. It terrified me so I made a doctor's appointment. My doctor said she thinks it is most likely hemorrhoids, but if it happens again to go back to GI. She also prescribed me Prilosec because I've had some upper symptoms and suggested I start the low FODMAP diet because this may be IBS. Since all of this started I have been gassy, bloated, feeling like there's a lump in my throat/chest, having irregular BMs and lack of appetite. I barely eat and I have started losing weight again which scares me. The weight loss has been rapid - 6 pounds this week. But I often eat one very small meal a day. I stopped the Prilosec because I suspected it was making my gas/appetite worse, I guess we'll see. But I'm freaking out. I also have bad anxiety especially around health issues so I can't stop obsessing over this. Someone please help, I'm terrified this is cancer or Crohn's. I'm only 20.
I've also had countless blood tests, stool samples, etc // all negative. I had an ultrasound and that was also all fine.

"I'm M/24.
So around sometime in december or so, I started getting indegestion...like more constant than I ever have.  Also noticed a very light and dull feeling in my stomach a little right of my belly button.  I ended up getting some different tests done, including a abdominal ultrasound which was okay.  I have gotten a bunch of blood tests for varying things too and all turned out okay.  I got a thyroid ultrasound, and my doctor said it seemed slighty off, but nothing really concerning and the thyroid blood test was okay.  
I kind of had a consistant on and off with the indigestion and stomach feeling, but like around a month ago or so, I had a little constipation a few times.  I also noticed two times (two days in a row) where my stool was dark.  I don't think it was tar black, but it was definitely dark brown.  I didn't really notice that again until 3 weeks or so later maybe.  But I also started having some bloatingness/and feeling more gassy and belching.  I also started feeling a little more light dull pain on my stomach.  It's usually in one spot, but kind of moves a little sometimes, usually staying on the right just very recently sometimes to the left.  Sometimes vaguely transitions to a lgith cramp feeling, but back into a very dull pain.  My constipation has been okay for a little bit, but its hard to tell if that is from the ezo Ive been on or not.  
I have noticed some small darker spots in the stool though...and possibly some more bright color...but hard to really tell what could be blood and what isn't.
I went to the GI last monday, and told me if after taking the ezo for two weeks and Im still not feeling great that I probably should get a colonospocy.  Does this sound like IBS..or IBD or crohns?  I'm just scared obviously of it being ""that worse thing"".

"info:19 years old male
it's been a year now, a very hard year! I remember the first day when I noticed the toilet filled with blood. I was shocked. Googled my symptoms which were bloating, constipation and bloody stool and came across colon cancer. 2 weeks later I visitd the gastro and after I insisted on him to do the colonscopy he accepted but he was not taking me seriously, results came in clear but it was not a complete colonscopy, months would pass but I still suffer from constipation alternating loose stool etc, and bloody stool from time to time and even some looke like dark red ones. So I had to do a full colonoscopy again convinced my doctor we had to do it and again results came clear apart a small proctitis. I was releived for a few weeks but now again I don't know what to do, I still notice some dark red blood from time to time (Forgot to say that my doctors attributed the bleeding to hemerhoids because bleeding is never an IBS symptom) and now often I released that my stool comes always with a dark brown line so I fear it could be blood from the small intestine like ""middle GI bleeding"". Do you think I need to even investigate more and ask for a capsule endoscopy or double ballon entroscopy because my doctors are not taking me seriously anymore. I'm always stressed they might miss something and do't know what to do anymore...

"Hi  I have had IBS for around 6/7 years.  Mainly constipation but very very occasionally diarreah.  I also suffer from anxiety especially health anxiety.  I have been having trouble with opening bowels in the last few months.  My gp has given me movicol which worked well but I could not put up with the wind and stomach cramps.  I then tried fybogel/mebeverine which also worked fairly well and was kinder on the stomach.  It seems to have stocked working athough I still go fairly easily each day the stools were coming like 1 and 2 on the bristol scale so contipation really.  My gp has now given me lactulose to try twice a day.  I had first dose this morning and feel very windy.  I believe this can happen but of course it could just be IBS.  I have never been able to tie down any foods that are a problem.  I eat porridge, wholemeal bread fruit and veg etc.  I know there is a difference of opinion about whether fibre is good for constipationor makes it worse.  I did think about taking nothing but don't want to go back to constipation as I am seeing the consultant next week re blood in the stools which my gp thinks has been caused by hard stools.  I am expecting to be referred from colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy because I am 69.   Obviously none of this is doing my anxiety any good and probably adding to digestive issues.  I should add I took mebeverine for years but my gp said it might be adding to the constipation so not taking it at the moment.  I am drinking plenty of water and have cut right down on tea.  Would love to know how you got on with lactulose and how long it took to work.  Thanks.

"Hello,
I already saw a doctor in Holland, but have the impression they sent me home without examining carefully.
I’m beginning 30 and normally don’t have ANY health issues (which I am very grateful for). However, since 2.5 months ago every day I have diarrhoea. Sometimes very watery, sometimes not – but never solid. Sometimes I am an hour late in the office because it just doesn’t stop. Throughout the whole day, severe stomach/intestine/? cramps every now and then. Sometimes I can’t even just walk the small bit between the parking place and the office because it just hurts and I need to rest. The pain is always on my left side, never on the right. Sometimes higher, sometimes lower.
The docs tested very few standard things and found Giardia. What changed after 10 days of antibiotics: absolutely nothing. Now they say, hey, just wait another month or two – it will stop eventually naturally.
If that’s so: Great, perfect, that’s a foreseeable timeframe. But maybe I also have something else?! Please have a look at the pictures of this morning… What the heck is that slimey stuff around my …?
It began in South East Asia, where I was very careful about food and water hygiene, but honestly also had some sexual encounters which I am not sure if this may have anything to do with or not.
Thank you.
Daniela

"Hi,
I'm hoping you can help me understand why this happens! Whenever I drink lager over a period of time I get stomach cramps and have to go to the toilet but it's not the need for a poo although it feels like it. I just basically release loads of gas and watery stuff. It doesn't happen straightaway and usually kicks in after around 6 hours or so. e.g. yesterday I had 4 pints from midday, went to the match and then went for a couple more drinks around 6pm and then it started.
I am not a big drinker and my lager days are a few and far between but when I do have a day out with my friends it can be quite annoying. If I stop drinking lager the problem stops almost straight away so I know it's not the alcohol but its something to do with lager and whats in it.
I also know the way to stop this is to not drink lager but what I'm really trying to do here is firstly understand why it happens and secondly whether there is anything I can do to alleviate it as I enjoy a few beers every now and again.
Thanks

"Hi. I am 28 years old. I have GERD, Bile reflux, gastritis grade A and doudoudenitis as was confirmed by my endoscopy 10 years ago also with hiatal hernia. I just had colonoscopy almost 2 weeks ago. The result was normal, the biopsy just got out and the result was that I have Chronic Non Specific Ileitis (Negative for Granuloma and Dysplasia) and Chronic Inflammation, Mild (Negative for Granuloma and Dysplasia). Does this result means I have Irritable Bowel Disease? My doctor is just so concerned with the negative result of Granuloma and Dysplasia but did not discuss with me the two diagnosis regarding Ileitis and inflammation. I did not have time to discuss this as the result is on his laptop and I am trusting his judgment so I did not look at the result I just listened to him and when I got home that's the only time I got to read it. I just want to ask if what I have was IBD and how severe was this? He only gave me Esomeprazole, mucosta and domperidone that I think were for my reflux and gastritis only.

"New to this, but trying to grasp as much information as I can, or to find others that maybe in a similar situation.
The last year has been hell. What started as a normal year, has been nothing but pain. February 2016, I woke up in the middle of the night with a throbbing stabbing pain in my lower right. Didn't hurt to push down, no tenderness, it wasn't just there.
The morning after I was in ge GP having an UltraSound. To no avail, nothing was found. GP's put it down to, surprise surprise, an IBS flare up...
I was placed on 40mg of Amitriptyline to help manage the pain and provide me some comfort.
A few months later a Gastroenterologist finally saw me, I had MRI, and another UltraSound. They decided to not do any other tests, as they couldn't see anything other than a bit of inflammation on my lower right side. And placed me on the Low FODMAP diet.
I'm in the introductory phase now after it's been a huge waste of time. Followed the diets strict regime religiously for around 6-7 months now. GP's believe I've 'distended my bowel', yet everywhere I look, there's nothing out there about a 'Disteneded Bowel'...
Everyday I'm still in agony with my right side, sharp stabbing pains. I've noticed pressing around my stomach I can 'pop' presumably gas bubbles. I've lost around 8 stone in a year also. It's caused me to unleash Borderline Personallity Disorder, something the psychological team believe has always been there but was brought out by the stress of pain everyday.
I'm at a wits end and any sort of communication would be forever appreciated. Thanks for reading.

"I've been diagnosed with IBS for some time now. My bloating is the worst I have ever seen on anyone, at first it was my lower bowl that was bloated but recently it's moved up to my stomach and has become 10x worse. I've also put two stone on in the past year (don't know if these are related?) and i'm burping a lot more.
I have a very active lifestyle, I cycle 8 miles a day during the week, go to the gym 3-4 times a week and eat a very healthy balanced diet (over the summer 2014 was more unhealthy so made a big change). I have museli or porridge with a banana for breakfast, an apple at around 11, salad with bulgur wheat, brown rice or lentils for lunch and then usually a stir fry or wholeweat pasta for dinner (bulghur wheat, lentils and pasta, and bread have all been cut out now). I also avoid diary as much as possible (recently cut it out completely in exhange for almond milk).
This morning I had porridge made with almond milk and banana with chia, flax and golden linseeds AND I'M BLOATED !!!
The doctor has tested my blood and stools for coelic and infections but all came back negative. I've been sent to the nutritionist who is referring me to go on FODMAP, but I have been trying to follow that until the appointment and still no help there. I've been drinking lots of water, taking peppermint capsules and warm lemon water and I'm still bloated.
I have an IUD coil fitted and asked the nurse practioner if it could be that, which she said no. Thing that worries me is we have both breast and ovarian cancer in my family, my mother died of ovarian cancer 10 years ago, but the doctors don't seem to think that's particularly important. Mind you he hasn't even looked/felt my stomach, but referred me to gastro so I guess they'll do that.
I'm so down and depressed with these symptoms, I'm literally doing everything to try and stop the bloating but nothing is working.
I went gluten free for over a year which helped, but I still got bloated. The doctor said that it was probably reducing the amount of fibre I was getting so I introduced it back into my diet (big mistake) 
The only time I don't get bloated is when I don't eat anything at all. My grandmother suggested I try the 5:2 diet to give my bowl a rest but I don't think it's a particularly healthy diet to be on, I tried it and my stomach was flat until I ate the next day.
Anyone got any solutions? I literally cry every day about this at the moment! I can't cope anymore!

"Hi
I am still not clear and haven't been back to the doctor -fear stops me. Although he did tell me after a bad outbreaknof semonella it can take quite a few months to go normally. I've read you can get PI IBS
The thing is I don't get pain and really don't have constipation very often. Unlike for years I used too.
I go regularly but when I go i do lots of pieces some are hard pieces but never just one large piece like before I had semonella. I most often end up with tiny pieces at the end and a tiny bit of mushy stuff.
Is this okay to have motions like this? Or am I paranoid? I don't get diarrea either since the poisoning 5 months ago. (Only once when I went on anti depressants) so is this really ibs - cos I'm not having pains diarrea constipation only smaller stools
And loose pieces too? Confused and very anxious every time I have a motion.

"Hi Everyone,
In November I started an extremely anxius phase where I thought I had HIV, got tested with a PCR and Elissa test at 7 1/2 weeks post exposure and was negative, got tested again at 4 1/2 months and was negative. I have put my anxiety aside now but I do have major digestive issues as my body is not absorbing nutrients. Blood tests showed low iron and Vitamin D, I feel fatigue most of the time.
The biggest difference is during workouts, I was was losing 600 to 800 calories during every workout session at one point and now if I push too much in the gym I feel malaise the day after.
Stool is soft and pale, probiotics has not done much. I saw bright red blood in my stool and had 2 stool tests, they show no bacteria or candida...could I have leaky gut. Supplements are really not helping, I have recently started digestive enzymes so will see how I fare in a week or so. Can anyone please advise on my condition, what tests will I need to get done to get to the root of the issue, I am tired of going from Dr. to Dr. to no avail.
Also not sure if it is related but I have excessive dandruff, dry skin and my left toe is numb. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Anal fissures have recently appeared and I do have anal itch at times. Dry mouth to some degree as well as dry eyes.

No idea what he was talking about as I was out of it and my mother heard no cancer and ignored the rest. A year on a gluten free diet and I was not better. Saw a gastroenterologist and was told I had been given the wrong blood test and did not have celiac... Then was told it could be a number of things and sent on my way. I gave up for years.

"Long story short i suffered from a lot of symptoms and did a lot of tests, heart echo, blood test, stool test, colono, endo.
My last test was colonoscopy so the docotor noticed some damage but he couldn't know if its crohn disease or not, so he gave me normix for 2 weeks then pentasa 500mg for 3 months when i started pentasa you have no idea how my life got better until now i stopped it and my symptoms are back including
swelling in the stomach
diharrea 
Abdominal pain and cramping and bloating, gets relieved when i do my BM
Doesn't feel like i emptied all in bathroom
Fatigue
Nausea sometimes
belching
Passing mucus in stool sometimes
Can this be IBS? I read the symptoms online and checked that pentasa helped a lot with IBS so i want to know
I took an appointment with the doctor ( another one ) thursday but i want to see what this community would say
P.S: Before i startr pentasa i had a lot of constipation and dirrhea it switches from this to this and ever since pentasa it was well organized for the whole 3 months without any single time conspitation ( i used to have constipation for all of my life  at least once a week )

"It started as stomach pains on and off across the abdomen and nausea. At first there was blood in the stool too but that's gone now. Sometimes it's pain sometimes it's nausea. The Doctors have ran a camera test down the throats and an ultra sound and found nothing. Could it be IBS?

"Hello,
Last October i had really bad digestive issues. Bloating/constipation and gas. I tried every single over the counter remedy, and nothing worked. Fast forward to December, and i found out i was pregnant. I started to feel a bit spaced out, it felt like i was extremely high. It would come and go, along with some headaches every couple of days, which with a little tylenol would be gone.This went away after a few weeks, and then a week later i miscarried. I did not feel spaced out, or have the headaches again until about 3 week later, and now the spaced out feeling is 24/7 from when i wake up to when i go to bed for the past 4 months. 
I am certain that these issues have some link to digestive problems, because the spaced out feeling gets worse when i eat sugar/carbs. I have been to a gastro who did some stool samples, and the only thing that came back was yeast overgrowth in stool. He gave me nystatin for 10 days, and it didn't do anything except make me a little more regular with my bowel movements. He wanted to do a colonoscopy, but i have put that on hold because i don't want to go under anesthesia with my head feeling this way. Other symptoms i am experiencing: 
Extreme light sensitivity 
Heartburn only after ""bad"" foods 
Bloating 
Constipation 
Stomach pressure 
Itchy ears/nose 
Post nasal drip 
Itching/red vagina (although yeast test from pap came back negative)
urgency/frequency urination (microscopic blood found in urine) 
Undigested food in stools 
White tissue bits in urine and stool 
Yellow nut looking things in stool sometimes without consuming nuts 
I have had a ct scan of the head which was normal, and have been tested for celiac twice. I also read about yeast overgrowth issues seems my gastro found overgrowth in my stool. I saw a doctor who deals with yeast overgrowth who has given me nystatin and diflucan to try. I am giving it a go, but i am 3 weeks into treatment now with 0 improvement. Could you possibly recommend what testing i should have done based off of my symptoms? I feel helpless right now and need some guidance. Sometimes i just feel like i would be more at peace not living, because this is no life. I am not saying i am going to do anything, but this is making me severely depressed. I am posting in this forum because it is the closest thing to digestive issues

"Hello, 
My name is cage and I am 17 years of age, I never done something like this before usually because people say self diagnosis is something to be wary of, and asking others anonymously online is just as bad. However I've ran out of ideas and my anxiety gets the best of me at times, so I'm pretty desperate as you can see.
So to start it off, I've had this for quite some time, almost a month, I think this dates back around last year where I was taken to a hospital with my dad to get checked out, they put an IV in me and took some blood tests, they found nothing too crazy other than the Rhino Virus (Just the common stomach bug). The symtoms feel similar to what that was, however I feel a lot worse. 
I wake up with an upset stomach, my mom who is chopped full of illnesses ruled out it's acid reflex, which I do believe is true, however I am suffering from what I believe is constipation, however I feel the need to go to the bathroom a handful of times here and there, only to sit on the toilet either for an hour or pushing out small mushy stool that isn't worth the struggle.
It's a pain in the ass, literally, It's been going on for awhile now and I'm stressed out. I try my best to avoid looking symtoms online, because I'm absolutely terrified of finding the slightest relation to something severe like colon cancer or whatever. I just want to get better, I considered the possability that it's IBS but I can't get a clear idea without speaking to someone professionally about it.
I'm really embarassed to mention this around my parents, I heard laxatives will help but asking my mom or dad to go buy me some is a bit overwhelming for me, or mentioning anything bathroom related around here. 
Any ideas? I don't know if I can go to a doctor anytime soon to get checked out, since that's not something I'm in charge of.

"Hi all,
I am a 26 year old male. I had some symptoms that, upon googling, I have become rather worried. First off I have really bad anxiety, and I feel like this could be causing some of these symptoms. 
So my symptoms are that I have about 2-4 bowel movements a day, a lot of the time they are loose and or thin and sometimes appear stringy. I don't have any overwhelming stomach symptoms, except maybe some tightness (which could very well be caused by anxiety.) I also frequently (not always) feel like I have some bowel pressure (worse when sitting than standing.) and I have additionally seen some undigested food in my stools. 
One alarming symptom is that some times after wiping a few times with toilet paper, I will have a very small amount of blood on only the paper (never seen noticable blood in stool itself.) This has been something that I have had for as long as I can remember, and I always associated it with wiping too hard. I also have some itching when walking around occasionally, again a symptom I have had for many years.
I am scheduling a GI appointment for hopefully this week or next week and I am very nervous about the symptoms. 
I first noticed a lot of these symptoms after beginning to take a probiotic, which after taking for about 6 weeks I stopped taking. After I stopped taking it the symptoms seemed to improve but they have been going back and forth. 
So does this sound like IBS, could the small amount of blood be caused by hemorrhoids that could be irritated by it? I also wonder how much my terrible health anxiety is playing into this. 
Thanks!

"i suffer from IBS and have had a pretty good run with it the past 8 months. I dont get terrible diarreah nowadays. I have to be careful what i eat though, i wouldnt say i was allergic to wheat and gluten but im definetely intolerant.
I can eat small amounts of food with wheat in it, but i cannot drink milk.
I switched to soya and it bloated me too much .
So i tried almond milk and ive been fine.
I decided I wanted to try oat milk. BAD MOVE
I really thought that would be ok, but i started it three days ago and couldnt work out until i realised it could be the oat milk why i was having such bad wind. Its painful too, but im constantly passing wind, thinking i may have an accident. When i go to the loo it isnt diarraeah but it feels like it will be.
Im literally taking each step with a fart ( sorry tmi) its constant.
I cant think of anything ive eaten different or havent eaten before. so im thinking it HAS to be the oat milk.
Has anyone else had any problems with oat milk? 
thanks in advance.

"Hi every one im 32, with type 2 diabetes, ibs suffer 3 years since found out
just before finding out had months daily constipation, diarrhoea, cramps, off too toilet 6 times a day, attacks sometimes after 1 hour
So went to doctor whilst investigating if I have diabetes was prescribed buscopan which was of no use as the underlying problem was still there. Next visit thank god was prescribed FYBOGEL..
fybogel was a miracle wthin a day I was relieved of discomfort and honest went only once to toilet that day wow!
Purpose of my message is I cant express how good fybogel is..forget about buscopan.coppermin,senokot and others out there they just dont work. Best results for fybogel as soon as you wake up before going toilet have 1 satchet and straight away drink 2 cups of water.. after that you might or not need to go toilet once or twice before/around lunchtime..after that the rest of day you wont relise you have ibs
Im afraid to say it wont get rid of ibs but does help by a mile to have a comfortable/managed day..without fybogel back will be all the problems of ibs, discomfort and definitely going toilet upto 6 times a day.beside this eating healthy and exercising very important
please please do try fybogel does exactly what it says..can be used for general constipation too
I haven't really looked into whats triggering ibs. maybe cos of diabetes/guten..but I do know spice upsets it big time and dairy products
I wish I could inform every suffer about fybogel..so please do forward to other people and messageboards to help each other fight ibs
until I find something else I will be continuing fybogel
thank you and good luck 18/05/14

"Hi all, I am hoping you might be able to give me some insight on IBS.  I have struggled with consitpation for many years.  Often going 'adequatedly' no more than 3 times a month and the rest of the time passing individual pellets whenever I sat on the loo.  3 months ago I had a grumbling tummy (I thought after eating too much beetroot from a supermarket salad bar) and since then I've been going 4 or 5 times a day - not with the urgency of diarhoea that comes with an infection but with an awareness it's time to 'go' and then experience very very loose stools - extraordinariy amounts of wind too.  I have had infection ruled out by a stool test, I have had cancer ruled out as I had a colonoscopy and imaging 2 years ago when I had 2 polyps removed and my Dr says it takes 7 years for anything sinister to grow and the images from there show all clear.  I had antibiotics for a week a month or so ago and that cleared it up for a week but this coincided with my menstruation which also stops the looseness - and takes me back to constipation - then when menstruation is over, these days I'm back to the over-regular looseness again.   I have a diagnosis of Depression and Anxiety and I have been on various medication for this on and off for 20 years, this settled into 150mg of Venlafaxine which I've now been taking daily for a couple of years.    I somehow can't feel any relation between my recent bowel complaints and my psychological condition.  Am I being silly and is this a clear case of anxiety induced IBS?  My Dr has prescribed a completely fibreless diet for a week, I think as a bit of a test and I haven't embarked upon this yet.  The fact is I'm not in any pain and it's such a relief not to be consitpated so I feel good - I just want to be sure I'm not overlooking something I shoudn't be.  Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

The worst part of what I am feeling is the excrutiating pain. I have had it for over two months now everyday! It's dibilitating because the pain is so strong I am crabby and non functional. Yesterday the doctor diagnosed me with IBS (just because he couldnt find anything else) and he prescribed me Dicyclomine. I dont know if my body has to get used to it but so far its not working. I would do anything to find a way to eliminate this pain in my lower right abdomen. I am not a pill person but I have had to take Tylenol everyday now for the last two months. It's the only way I can function. Is anyone else experiencing these sharp pains?

"I wanted to share with you a very simple remedy for keeping the bowels in good working order which has really helped me. I meant to say I have a prolapsed bowel and absolute chronic daily IBS without let up.
A few days ago I became very thirsty and knew I had some limes in the fridge left over from one of my recipes not sure which but I squeezed them and added some tap water and drank it down. Well for three days my colonic issues were a lot better, so I wondered what I'd accidentally stumbled on so decided to consolidate this unexpected gain and bought some lemons and some more limes. I figure if I drink juice from one lemon and one and a half limes, as they are smaller than lemons and add a slightly less tart flavour, every two or three days, I might find my troublesome bowels in better shape.
Incidentally I have tried aloe vera, which gave me chronic diarrhoea and conversely coconut oil made me dreadfully constipated but genuinely folks my lemon and lime simple clense appears to be working and inexpensive, lemons and limes only 35p each in most shops. Please try as it's really helping. Best wishes, Fiona

"Hello,
 I have written on here previously and had some amazing answers, today I am having a massive flare again and need some help and hope!!
The doctors are now telling me I am depressed, I can assure you I am not. They are telling me they have done all they can, but this does not help me. I am still in so much pain and I am still having all the symptoms I had before.
Please can someone help me!!
So today I had a flare up, quite large and extremely painful.
I started the day with a green tea and had yogurt and granola, throughout the day I have had green tea, white tea and peppermint tea. I then had a salad for lunch and a few pistachios for a snack.
I am not doubled over with pain, the pain is in the middle of my stomach (from top to bottom) and then either side at the top is really painful. The pain is making me feel nauseous and faint. To help ease the pain I am having to double over but this only relieves it for the moment. It is also causing me to have hot flushes!
Please can someone help me as I am becoming really scared of what it may be.
 I have been told it is IBS but I still feel like it is something more. Even if the doctors won’t tell me I would quite like to know what it may be so I can research things that may help.
 Thank you in advance!!

"Hi; I'm 18 male and have had blood and mucus in stools either once, twice or three times a week for a couple months. The blood is sometimes mixed with the stool and sometimes it's just visible on the toilet paper. It's bright red blood which I believe is fresh and from the lower part of my intestine. There is never much just a few staines on the toilet paper. My bowel movements have changed from having one a day to twice or three times a day. I sometimes have a sharp pain in the rectal area that lasts a couple of seconds however no discomfort when passing a stool other than what feels like a little tear. I've been to doctors and they prescribed me with scheriproct. This hasn't worked however and am still seeing blood and mucus in stool once every couple of days. Cheers for any advice given am planning on going to doctors again for a scan in next couple of days just need to sort it out with work.

"Hi
I'm new here but in desperate need of advice. I've suffered on and off with IBS since my late teens ( now mid 40's. I had several years without problems. I've always had a weak stomach so it doesn't take much to upset it. I started teaching 3 and a half years ago and since then my IBS is back with a vengence. I've tried everything possible...... peppermint capsules, tablets for anxiety, mebeverine tablets, taking away stress but nothing works. I love my job but the mornings are an utter nightmare at the moment. I am on the loo countless times before I leave for work at 7.30. Once I get through to the afternoon the symptoms ease and I'm fine at night I've begun to dread the morning and get anxious at the thought of them. I dread getting to work and having to rush to the loo. I don't have much pain just a desperate urge no matter how often I go to the toilet. I've begun to stop going places at weekends for fear of needing the toilet and even on holiday last year every time I ate out it was the same. It's really affecting my life and I need to gain back some control. Can anyone help?

"Hi there. I'm kind of like a long time sufferer of IBS. 5 years ago I had a sigmoidoscopy due to bloated and gassy stomach accompanied by constipation and fresh blood after wiping. It went fine and I was told I had IBS. I've just tried living with it since I eat relatively healthy but symptoms come and go. Last summer I started getting diarrhea instead of constipation. I went to the doctors and they took a stool sample and blood test and both came back fine. Around December my loose stools and frequent passing came back again. I put this down to excessive alcohol drinking over Xmas but the loose stools and frequent passing remain. I had a blood test a couple of weeks ago as I had a couple of quite bad chest infections, again bloods came back fine. I'm not sure if my symptoms remain because I've been struggling with anxiety and depression lately but I'm going to the loo like 3 times a day. My stools sometimes are quite solid, other times not so much but they are never accompanied with blood or dark stools and there's no pain or anything. Does it sound like this is just IBS symptoms? I'm going on a strict and bland diet next week akin to the FODMAP diet and if it doesn't help I'm going to book another doctors appointment. As mentioned I've had some mental issues recently so this may have exaggerated other symptoms but I've generally not been feeling myself.

"About 6 months ago August 2016 I had severe constipation which forced me to visit my local emergency room and upon submitting myself to a test (x-ray) it showed that I was severely constipated and the doctor prescribe me Mira-Lax stool softner. fast track another 3 months later November 2016 I again suffered the same incident this time however I was determined that it was not as severe and simply constipation. I went like this for almost 6-7 days without a stool until I began to worry and began taking over the counter medication again I resorted to Mira-Lax and prune juice which helped. However this time upon emptying my stomach I felt different as if my stomach was swollen or inflamated. I can only describe the pain as if I had stiched my intestines back together being that I'm not a girl I'm unsure if this is cramps, but the pain as felt on all areas of my stomach and not a specific area. This is where it all began or at least the first time I felt this. 
I went like this for two weeks until I couldn't bear putting it on the back of my head and setup an appointment with a gastrologist specialist. Whom suggested I do a colonoscopy. Upon completed the colonoscopy he found no issues aside from a small polyp which he removed and said everything looked fine. I rested for about a month in which a this period I would still get ocassional stomach pains but I blamed the colonoscopy. I then contacted again my doctor and told him I still continued to felt the pains ocassionally it comes around like this I said ""Monday and Tuesday I'm normal no pains then coincidentally out of no where I get the pain which is a sensation of bloatness, gas, with the pains as if someone had stiched my intestines back up or as if I have something inside pushing my intestines. He advise I get now a ultrasound to ensure no other organs could be provoking this liver, gallbladder etc. Again results came in and he said nothing out of the ordinary appeared. 
Fast foward to today and I am schedualing a cat scan to rule out any other possible things. However this is going to take 1-2 more weeks but I'm completely clueless as to what could be causeing this to me or was it in fact my intestines damaged due to severe constipations I had. However, I have not been constipated lately anymore and I feel no pains when going.
I have tried drinking, eating grease, unhealthy, eating healthy and drinking water but nothing really triggers it that I'm aware of or that I can point out. 
Would this be symptoms of IBS? or what test shoud I be asking my gastrologist to perform on me to better rule what it could be. Feel free to ask anything I could have missed to better respond to my situation. God bless everyone.

"Hey all, just a little insight until I get into my recent issues; I'm an 18 year old male who has OCD/ anxiety for years. My possible ibs started about 1 1/2 ago. For a while now I've been worried about my constant stool changing patterns (constipation, diarrhea) and the look of my stools (mucus, slimey, mud looking) and you would imagine with OCD and anxiety that I'm a HUGE WORRIER. 10 minutes ago I had a stomach ache and I had a bowel movement and it's the same kind of story.. mud looking, mucus, food in it, and slimey. I literally spent a few minutes moving it around with a cotton swab.(embarrassing I know). Thinking it's cancer or some underlying disease I have. plus I've been to the gastronolegeist about 4 times. I did the blood test and stool sample once. And I'm currently waiting for the results to my second blood test and I'm delivering my stool samples tomorrow. Each time I've been to the gi, the doctor I see gives me the same story, ""try the low fodmap diet"" ""probiotics"" and I've been cleaning my diet up recently, but I'm left with the same worries as before. Maybe I'm overreacting, but I don't feel like I'm being diagnosed and treated correctly. Although I have gained weight from an unhealthy 120 pound nauseous 17 year old with no appetite to a 150 pound 18 year old. I still find myself with the same worrys. I'm also on 200mg of Zoloft for my OCD, anxiety, and depression. Which I believe has helped. I was in a really bad place a year ago and I have improved but I'm still concerned with what's going on now . I've heard that people are given anti depressants for ibs (not the reason I was put on Zoloft). So what does anyone think; is it ibs? did anxiety cause ibs? Are these symptoms normal? and I want to get some insight from other ibs sufferers or anyone who has advice for me. Thanks for taking your time out to help.

"Hello thought I would introduce myself, I am 39 years old, looking back I have always had toilet issues, but over the last 2 years it's got worse and I have now been prescribed anti depressants as the doctor thinks it's stress related IBS! I'm not convinced this is the answer but I'm willing to give it a go! My main symptoms are...I constantly feel that i need the loo, I go 3-5 times a day, but never feel empty, it is as though I can feel the poo sat in my bottom, I'm regularly sore from wiping so much too, I've had a sigmoidoscopy which was clear, I'm now waiting for anCT scan which I think will show if anything as I won't be 'empty' for it like i was for the sigmoidoscopy. With the constant feeling of needing the loo it has put me off doing my regular exercise as I am in constant fear I'll have an accident as the feelings are that intense! I also suffer from Lots of rumblings and I don't mean from my tummy From my bottom!?? Also I worry when I need to pass wind as quite often it feels that poo will come out instead!? Anyone else suffer like this and know of what can help? I'm so fed up of the way I feel all the time!!

"I am a 54 year old woman going through a lot of anxiety and stress regarding my marriage, family and future. I have recently been successfully treated for an over active thyroid and also had four years on antidepressants (been off those now for a year) and take temazepam nightly for insomnia. I have dropped over two stone in the last 18 months and am now underweight according to my BMI. I have always had a poor appetite in the mornings, but recently this has become worse. I have nausea, a constant rumbling in my stomach and colon. I have cramptind pains which radiate to my back. I have a general soreness and rawness feeling throughout my whole intestine. I also have diarrhea shortly after eating during the day and bloating and wind in the evening and through the night. My insides rumble all night long.
So far I have tried colpermin which helps a bit with the cramping. I am on omeprazole but that gives me vivid dreams and nightmares all night long and still no relief. Can all this be IBS?

"Are you looking for a cure for your IBS?  I was. I did a lot of research on the Internet for anything that would provide me some relief.  I had the usual effects of IBS: constipation, stomach cramps,  not being able to eat certain foods without paying the price. I was bloated and couldn’t lay on my stomach without uncomfortable pain. My IBS came on slowly at the age of 63. At my age I thought I was dying of some dreaded disease. But I found that if I, through the process of elimination, reframe from certain foods I would feel better these included raw onions, oatmeal, and some dairy products. By doing this I was able to control my problems.  But I still wasn’t satisfied. I didn’t have this before, so there must be a solution. What was it that made me feel so ill? While seeing the Doctor I was told it might be Irritable Bowel Syndrome but she wanted to do some expensive tests but didn’t offer a cure if it was. So I went back to the Internet for anyone’s help.
What I found was information on SIBO (short for ‘small intestine bacteria overgrowth’). And guess what, SIBO can be cured in many people. So I went back to my doctor asking her for her help and she told there was no such thing as SIBO. It was just something made up by naturopaths and was ""out there"" to give false hopes.
But I still wanted to try and cure my IBS and at least try the SIBO cure. What I needed was a certain anti-biotic called Rifaximin. This anti-biotic was known to work on the small intestines. Wow, that sounds just what I needed but I was unable to attain it through my doctor. So the hope just sat there in my mind for months.
My chance for a cure came months later when I needed a tooth extracted for an unrelated problem. My Dentist pulled my tooth and gave me a prescription for Amoxicillin , which is an antibiotic. The tooth socket really hurt for a long time and took my mind off the  IBS. The prescription was for 500mg three times a day for 10 days. I took my prescription religiously for those 10 days.
When the pain for the tooth extraction went away I found my IBS symptoms had gone away too! Eureka! Although I had taken a different antibiotic than what I was seeking I was cured and I have been that way for months now.
So I am going to publish this in hopes that you will not give up hope in finding your cure of IBS as I did.
I would not recommend getting a tooth pulled to obtain an antibiotic but find a doctor who will prescribe Rifaximin. Or if you are planning a trip out of the country….. just saying. Good luck

"So I have been around this website for a couple months and decided to post.
 So I used to be very active and not so much anymore since I got hurt at my job, I almost do nothing active cause it hurts my knee, currently getting treatment. But any way I’ve been battling stomach issues since I quit my job it seems like, it starting with diarrhea and now I have stomach pains, grumbling, farting, but no diarrhea at least for about a month or 2. It all started after a very stressful time in my life (personal) a couple issues just got stressful in my life. But I was dealing with mostly just diarrhea and my doctor said I was fine and run its course as I did and it got better but in the months after i would still get some pain and alot of gas.
  Fast forward to now I moved out about 5 weeks ago, I’m 22 and I have had nothing but healthy and barely any pain for the first three weeks but the next 2 have been pain mostly, but with some grumbling in my stomach and some gas like 15-25 after dinner but still healthy bowel movements in the morning, which is the only time i usually go.
 Now tonight I cut out some big gluten things like pasta but still have like the stuff that has some gluten in it like breadcrumbs. But even after cutting it out, I still seemed to have some issues. Now today I had some mac and cheese that had gluten in it and I went for a walk and about 45 min after I had to run to the bathroom with my first bad bowel movement in at least 5 weeks.
 A weird kirk to this is often times I will eat dinner and not have an issue and then eat lunch the next day which will be the same food and will have problems and vice versa and another thing is like if I go out with my gf a lot of times I don’t have a single problem and sometimes I think it is all in my head, since it has been going on so long I almost think like what’s gonna happen to me now just like tomorrow when I eat I’m gonna hope I’m fine, but be worried.
 Since I am a student and I work, I feel it just adds stress and the stress has no where to go, in the past 2 weeks I was in the need of an internship and had a deadline so I feel that added some stress and now it will add more having the internship, but idk if that’s causing my problems like not having a way to relieve my stress through exercise. Which it seems my gf is stress reliever cause when I’m with her I don’t think of any of this stuff, sometimes I might get a little pain but then we either do something or talk about life and it goes away.
 I’m going to make an appointment with a gastroenterologist this week to see if we can come up with anything. But I would like to hear from some of you and see what you think? My dad thinks it’s just stress cause it 95% of the time doesn’t affect my life, I usually can go do everything like family events, events with my gf and such on small walks, play with my nephews go to school, work, it’s not like I spend all my time inside my house. The only time it affects me is like nights like this because I just think why did this happen and is there something really wrong, which I doubt cause if there was id imagine my symptoms would be worse or it would affect me more
 Thanks a lot for reading! Sorry for being so long.

"Diagnosed with post-infections IBS after a clear colonoscopy several weeks ago. If I stick with a fairly bland diet, can usually manage the condition fairly well but do find occasionally that my stools will be a little lighter and will have yellow on the tiolet paper after wiping. 
Have a follow-up with my GI in a few weeks but this has me concerned. Could it simply be diet related or should I be worried about my pancrease and/or gall bladder as well?

"I've struggled with constpation for many years now. I usually get the urge to pass a bowel movement every 2-3 days, or 4 times a week if I'm lucky. 
About 2 years ago I had a common eye infection and took some antibiotics. I was producing 2 significant bowel movements a day whilst I was on the medication, which lasted about a week. It went back to normal after I stopped taking it
I then had surgery 1.5 years ago and took anitbiotics. It was the same deal, except I was having once to twice daily bowel movements just about every day for 7-8 months. It slowed down a bit after that, but I was averaging 5-6 times a a  week for a year after the surgery. It's recently started slowing down, and I'm back to 3ish times a week.
What is this indicative of? Normal constipation cures, like prune juice/more fiber etc don't do much. Antibiotics seem to be the silver bullet, but I'd like to know what my pattern indicates
Thanks

"Hey everyone my name is Robert I'm 30 years old. about 5 weeks ago I had bad body aches and my health anxiety kicked in and I also started to get mushy stools thought I was getting sick so went to doctor everything came out normal on my blood work. So some relief there then my bowel movements changed again to more of a constipation with terrible bloating for a few days with lots of uncomfortable gas stuck I guess . Dr prescribed my lactulose which gave me some much needed relief . I have not had too much bloating since then but my stools have been Much smaller. And a few days I have been going at least twice a day when I normally only go once .Also should be noted that my anxiety has been pretty high during all this. Went to dr he told me it seemed like IBS due to all my other symptoms coming from anxiety. Are these signs of IBS?

"Hello Everyone,
?I feel I'm not really contributing anything helpful to the group but it is comforting to know people are there. So here goes again. This is another rough and frightening evening. Hardly anything ""out"" yesterday despite all my medication and again I'm having difficulty with my thoughts. The black dog thought of what if this is it Pat and nothing will work again. It's so difficult to avoid lapsing into this state particularly as I can't actually talk to anyone about this except my doctor and of course she isn't ""on tap"" as it were.
?As I've said on previous occasions, I don't know what you can really do to help - I'm sure you all realise I'm not being rude when I say that - but I hope this may be of some help and comfort to anyone going through the same thing. That said, any thoughts oe comments would be most welcome.
?Thank you for reading this and all the best to you all,

Shortly after stopping work my IBS disappeared completely and I no longer suffer from it, it was just the effect of bullying, anxiety and distress that was giving me the symptoms of sever IBS which I had come to think of as being a permanent fixture.;  I am now much happier although missing work my health has improved and I have got over my breakdown, just a shame that I had to go through it in the first place, has anyone else been affected by office worker stress and discrimination?

"Hello, I am a 21-year-old female and I got diagnosed with GERD (at least while lying), gastritis signs, hyperthyroidism and recently swollen sinuses. My heartburn issues and acid regurgitation started approximately in March and it always happened because of the combination of stress and lack of food and maybe over-tension, it was pretty severe these times, but went away when I calmed down. I started to take Nexium 20mg for two weeks, but I didn't feel like that really helped, I even feel like it made it worse because once when I got really angry suddenly my stomach hurt a lot for a longer while and that never happened before just because of anger, at least not in a severe way like that. 
Now: The heartburn and acid regurgitation have stopped more or less, but I still don't feel healthy at all.
My symptoms right now:
.) swollen sinuses and often the feeling of blocked ears (I got a nasal spray and it seems to help a bit, but that's not the permanent solution)
=> so I can't taste and smell that well and it sucks
.) Mucus, especially while brushing my teeth and sometimes after eating
.) foreign body sensation at the neck, sometimes worse and sometimes less worse
.) sometimes trouble swallowing, especially while doing sports (it was definitely different earlier) 
.) no hunger feeling since at least two months - I still like eating, but I hate the fact that I don't feel normally hungry like I used to, it makes me really sad - I also don't feel full like I used to and somehow I also miss the feeling of thirst 
What I don't have: coughing, a permanent hoarse voice...
But this still sounds like LRP, even though it hasn't been diagnosed yet (I already have a date for the check though).
Click here to view image
I would be grateful for an answer. Does this sound like LRP? Is this abstinence of a hunger feeling related to it somehow or does it sound like something different? How big are the chances that I ever will feel better again, what do you think?

"I've been sufforing with IBS symptoms for over 5 years now and i've still not found a way of coping with it or easing the symptoms. I've been back n fortth to the doctors trying diffferent things I've literally tried everything the doctors have to offer with no success, i'm constantly feeling bloated/tender like someone pumped my bowel up like a tyre and the pain from it is always on my left just beside my hipbone funny enough thats where the gas gets backed up and trapped. My stool when i go tge toilete is also very strange, i can have signs of ibs-c and ibs-d within one sitting. Part will pass sollid and break away like thousands of rabbit dripping in the toillet and then the rest will be very soft and pale. Any changes to my diet or the ammount of food/water i have will make no different to the stool or the gas/pain i caniterally eat anything and my stomach will start to nean and groan right away. Do you guys think its ibs that i've got or something else as some of my symptoms seem unique when compared to everyone elses ibs.

"Husband passed away in 2014 and my son disowned his family when he fell in love!  Started with spells of food upsetting me  then lots of wind . Then I started having what was simply diagnosed as abdominal cramping. A friend suggested I stop eating bread and potatoes which helped initially. Would have mornings when the pain just knocked me off my feet. I was constantly bloated and seemd to be putting more weight on. Had lots of bladder problems but if I contacted surgery was always told that samples were clear. Went back to the Gp who simply said I will refer you.  During the eleven months that I waited for an appointment I was gradually getting worse. The more fruit and fibre I ate the worse I was and I eventually gave up cerals etc. The 'attacks' were lasting longer and they always seemed to start with sinus symptoms sometimes sneezing sessions then I would just simply become so chilled (occassionally it would be burning up)  my body would ache or my joints would hurt and I just couldn't do anything.  I was in so much pain,  one of the last attacks lasted almost three days.  I eventually had a hospital appointment was asked a few questions.  It was suggested that It was down to stress due to the loss of my husband and the grief caused by my son. I was also told that I was eating too much fruit and most probably had fructose malabsorbtion.It would probably be a good idea if I saw the dietician.  I would be sent for a scan.  I initially gave up fruit introducing small amounts of limited varieties and found that I was so much better  I went for a colonoscopy, (which almost knocked me out the pain from the gas was as bad as that had  I suffered normally) I received a letter telling me telling me that the scan didn't show anything of concern apart from a small hernia in the abdominal wall..  Blood tests were normal so it is most probably due to IBS and the high fruit content in my diet. I did not need to be seen again!  I was feeling so much better, full of energy, my bowel habits had returned to normal, my bladder problems were very rare, got the occasional mild cramp in my lower abdoman.  One morning I decided to try porridge and I was so ill all day the stomach pains were unreal, the 'flu sumptoms etc. Yet I was fine the next day.  Another disaster was prunes and natural yogurt they caused a lot of discomfort for a few hours.Over Christmas I even managed to eat some Christmas pudding without any ill effects. Until the beginning of the year I felt so much better then I started with a really upset stomach, diarrhoea(which I had not experienced  previously,) feeling really nauseous., lower back pain( haven't suffered with any back pain for years.) These attacks seem to be recurring every few days, along with the sinus symptoms, burning, itchy skin, painful joints. I always seem to have a cough. I  had to be extremely careful as to what I ate  as I was getting a lot of heartburn. I started with these symptoms for a couple of days the the other day I ate some home made soup.  As soon as the soup hit my stomach I felt pain, burning up, nausea.  The pain was excruciating, the sweat was rolling off me I was so weak.  Eventually I managed to struggle to the bathroom but only had very soft formed motions but lots of it. Nothing I could do would ease the pain  if I'd have had the strength I think I would have dialled 999!  I was conscious of pain in the area of the hernia. I felt so weak.  I mostly drank boiled water the next 24 hours .  Then I felt so much better as my stomach felt as if it had had a massive clear out.  I am almost afraid to eat in case it starts all over again.  Is the IBS umbrella so big that it covers all these symptoms??  No one has ever bothered to discuss my symptoms or advise me apart from the consultant suggesting I reduced the amount of fruit in my diet.  I cook from scratch don't eat bread, cakes biscuits,sweets , cereal. fried or fatty foods.  PLEASE can anyone shed any light on this?  it would be so much appreciated.

"Hello,
  So I was diagnosed with IBS when I was about 16/17 - I'm now in my early 20's. There's something I've always wondered but can't find any info on. More things used to trigger my IBS in different ways, such as potatoes, bananas, alcohol, and caffeine. I ended up still consuming this stuff either occasionally or more frequently (like alcohol - again I was in my teens) and over time it seems like I've developed a 'tolerance' to these things as they no longer affect me. I'm not taking any meds. I still can't have certain breads for example as they give me horrible pain or/and trapped gas but I've noticed some days I haven't been able to avoid it and I get no symptoms? I used to eat a small amount of potato and be rolling over in pain that night from severe cramps - now I'm eating small potatoes all the damn time and getting no symptoms, ever. (but sometimes get cramps from thick chips) I couldn't have coffee or alcohol or I'd be sat on the toilet for hours feeling like death but now it's more or less 'normal' effects - and I have very strong coffee. I'm not complaining but why can't I find anything online about this? If I repeatedly force myself to eat stuff that causes symptoms will it just get used to all food again?
Does anyone know much about this, or have similar experiences?
I apologise if this is a long, stupid question.
Thanks.

"I have IBS and I have been diagnosed.
I have had an IBS Flare up for about 4-5 weeks.
Now, it seems to be recovering...
But, however,
the symptoms were having very loose poo, and then following with extremely bad constipation where I would have to sit on the toilet for about 2-3 hours at times just in order to get something out. I would wait for an hour, trying to force something out only for nothing (not even sufice to call it a rabbit dropping, like half of that) and then another hour and another hour and so on.
It was awful.
And then even after all that time, I would not be finished pooing, and I was physically left with poo still there as I got up. This was very uncomfortable and not even mental (if that make sense).
It was so awful that sitting down is so uncomfortable, i had awful belly ache, so bad that it would make it harder to sleep, and even to walk right at the beginning (the worst day/time of the flare up).
Now, as I said, things seem to be clearing up.
But now I have this awful bellyache still, pretty uncontrollable bowel movements, I feel sick and nauseas and have an up and down loss of apetite. I also am not finished usually and in the last bowel movement that I just had this was the case.
This is ruining my life.
I am a University student studying my degree.
I have to have frequent toilet visits in the day, as you can imagine, I have even had to skip class due to needing to be on the toilet for so long. It is awkward for me and really ruining and very much getting in the way of my life.
Currently, I am so uncomfortable.
I have Fybogel Sachet form of the Mebevrine that I usually take three times a day just in order to ease the lower belly ache. (Which I haven't started yet)
Anyone experiencing these similar symptoms before?
Anyone else like me in this way?
Some solidarity would be great.
I would love to know that I am not alone.
Also any help or advice, or tips for the here and now experiences that I am facing would be great also.
Thank you so much everyone, and hey everyone.
I would love to get some feedback.
NB: Do you think that this is indeed an IBS Flare up? Or could it be something else? No blood, just all the symptoms that I have listed. Thanks.
Already asked the doctor, wish that I'd been more specific and impendant on asking what is scientifically going on. Just for my peace of mind. and then I could know how best to treat it.
Anyway thanks for reading all of this.
Sorry I know that it is rambly but there really is alot that I wanted to say and I hope it all makes sense. !! <3

"Hello.  
I am looking for some advice/help with my IBS.  I have almost constant constipation, gas and bloating and get bowel cramps.  I was diagnosed a long time ago and have tried various different things to try and help, with little success.  I also tried the FODMAP diet and it made no difference.  I recently had a telephone consultation with a dietician (referred by my GP), who said I needed to up my fibre intake (she said I should be aiming for 30g a day, but am currently on under 10g).  I have had 2 days of higher fibre and, frankly I'm in agony.  I have been cramping all morning (constantly) and feel more constipated than ever.  
Is it that I just need to give it a few days for my body to adjust, or is it best to stop?  My thinking is that a diectician would know best, but I also know I shouldn't be feeling like this.
I am also trying to up my water intake, as I am very bad at drinking enough (I know this also affects my IBS).
Any thoughts/advice gratefully received.  Thank you.

"Hi all,
I am a 21 year old female who has been experiencing what I feel are IBS like symptoms for about 8-10 months. It all began when I got what I assumed was a stomach bug or maybe the flu about that long ago. After I recovered from whatever that was (I had a sore stomach, nausea, no appetite and fatigue) I began to worry about my health. I began having random bouts of loose, mushy stool (not diarrhea per say) and abdominal discomfort. I would only have a bm though once or twice a day. I got worried when that started happening and began googling my symptoms and self diagnosing. I started taking a probiotic (align) which seemed to help. But around about December i noticed this stopped happening one or twice every 3 weeks or so but now it seems to be every few days. Ill get abdominal discomfort after eating then have one or two loose bms. It will go away for a day or two and I will have formed (but not much coming out) stool only to revert back to a loose stool. I am an anxious person, I do google symptoms and do worry that something's wrong. I have no fevers, no blood in stool. All my symptoms seem only digestive (gas, discomfort, loose stool). Definitely made worse by my worrying. Have had normal blood work and my doctor thinks that it's just stress but I'm not sure. Is this mild ibs? Can it go away since it seems more like pi-ibs? Just want some insight if these symptoms seem relatable or not enough to be ibs and maybe just stress.

"Hi,
Is there anyone else who suffers abdominal pain after a bowel movement. Sometimes my pain can last for many hours. The pain is all over my abdomen. The pain can be quite severe at times, also my abdoman makes strange noise's. I always thought the pain was meant to subside with a BM but not in my case. I have had very very loose stools for over a month and still got the pain after and now my stools are firming up a little, i am still getting the pain. Just curious if anyone else suffers like this.

"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends hypnotherapy – but only for patients who have been on “pharmacological treatments” for a year and whose IBS symptoms are “refractory” (ie, have not yielded to treatment).
This raises an important question: wouldn’t it be better to make hypnotherapy the initial treatment of choice rather than holding it back in the last chance saloon? If hypnotherapy offers hope of relief after everything else has more or less failed, surely it must offer the same hope of relief before anything else is even tried...
The Manchester Approach and the North Carolina Protocol have been demonstrably successful in treating IBS symptoms for the majority of patients who have experienced either of these hypnotic treatments.

But all tests show that everything is fine except my pain keeps getting worse. I followed up with the physician who did the procedure and she assures me nothing is wrong and says you were in pain before you seen me. But I tell her not like this. I originally seen her cause I kept having a these attacks in my upper abdomen every couple months that felt like pressure going into my shoulder and chest. Now my colon feels like someone ran a wire brush through it and I'm affraid it's never going to go back to the way it was. I have IBS-C but pain was never a daily issue. Only occasionally and it would subside with a good bowel movement or passing gas. Now a good bowel movement seems to aggravate it and so does constipation. So I'm left just constantly in pain and when I call the drs office they tell me they'll leave a message with the dr and have her call me back except they don't call me back.

"Hi all - I'm 18 years old and have suffered with IBS mainly for the last 6/7 years (school aggravated the symptoms and made it worse).
After being passed from pillar to post via the NHS, 4 years down the line I was just told I had IBS and what the 'motions' of this was.
Currently, I'm on a cocktail of prescription drugs for this (Omeprazole 2 x day, Dicycloverine Hydrochloride 3 x day and Loperamide Hydrochloride 1-2 x a day). Although this mixture is allowing me to enjoy a life with minimal impact from my bowel, my mum is convinced this is all going to be at the expense of my overall health. I have also been to CBT sessions over two seperate periods of times.
My question is: Does anyone have any less/other conventional methods for which they use/do to treat their IBS? (Diets, excercises, probiotics etc.)
Thanks in advance.

"Hello everyone,
I am a 16 year old male. For the past 2+ months, I've been experiencing symptoms that I think may be IBS.
In early November, I had wisdom teeth surgery and was on Clindamycin (which I had never taken before) and a heavy dose of Advil for 10 days. About a week and a half after I was done with the medications, I started experiencing the symptoms that have now lingered for the past 2 months.
I have had consistent bloating in my lower abdomen, which I presume is filled with a large amount of gas. However, one of my main symptoms is that I am unable to pass this gas easily.
Also, my bowel habits have been different. I have had consistent incomplete bowel movements, and instead of releasing a long piece of stool, I am only able to release smaller pieces, or sometimes ball-shaped pieces. When I am having a bowel movement, it feels that I have not releasing all of the stool that needs to be released. Also, I have noticed some mucus in my stool for the first time.
Along with these symptoms, about once a month I go through a period of about 3-4 days where I have mild constipation.
So to sum up, I have a difficulty passing gas, incomplete bowel movements, and a change in the shape of my stool.
On the bright side, I do want to note that my condition is NOT debilitating. I have not had to make serious changes in my lifestyle. I go to the gym 5 days a week and am in very good shape. I have plenty of energy, and if it were not for this annoyance I would feel that I am in excellent health. I understand that my condition is mild compared to others, but is becoming very annoying and want to understand more about it.
If anyone has any insight on this, please let me know! Thanks for reading!

"Since the starting of June to the first part of September I have been seeing my doctor for various reasons. The July to August one was about a persistent cough that wouldn't go away no matter what the doctors did or gave me so I ended up thinking I had lung cancer. The doctors though just chalked it down to being a cough that lingered after a cold, which they were right because by Sept the coughing stopped. Anyways I'm talking about this because I feel like it ties into my dilemma now. During those months I developed a dull ache/cramping feeling on my left side where my ribs are. It developed after a month into my coughing fits. On the other hand I was having bowel problems to. TMI but, I always had a gas problem when I was in school. I mean after every meal my stomach would be filled with gas that I couldn't let go due to the fact I was at school and even if I wasn't eating I would have gas. On top of that I experienced bright red blood found on my toilet paper off and on and anal discomfort/pain ( went to the doctor about that during the summer and she did find a fissure). Going on I experienced constipation during that summer and is still happening. Some days it is just a problem of straining others I could go two days without going. When I first noticed my constipation I looked at my stool and saw white spots all over it ( I did not examine it farther though). This continued until recently where it now has died down but my contstipation hasn't. I did talk to my doctor about this after my last examination for my lungs and she said I should start drinking more water and eating more fruit that had fiber in it since my current diet lacks both of these. I did try that but, of course it is a little hard for me to eat fruit everyday let alone drink water and not pop. Now though, on and off I have experienced days where I constantly go pee and it is clear. Today, which is making my panicking worse, I feel that pain in my rib again and some abdominal cramping (not sever to the point where it cripples me). This just came after a bad day on thursday where I drank coffee and ended up with diarrhea. I am also panicking cause the diarrhea was hard to push out but that could be due to the fact I pretty much held it in the whole day due to school? I do not think I feel bloated and I do not think I am losing weight. There does not seem to be blood on my stool or on toilet paper anymore. I am 17 years old turning 18 this month. My family does have a history of this cancer ( my grandma, I think my uncle but not to sure, and some of my moms cousins) so far no one in my generation. I am just really scared and worried at the same time right now.

"Just before Christmas I developed a pain in my lower left back, side and waist. After 2 weeks I visited the doctor and at this point I had no other symptoms. She checked my urine to rule out a kidney infection, which came back clear, she tested for a hernia, which came back clear, she ruled out muscular pain, and referred me for an ultrasound on my ovaries in case I had a cyst. I had this yesterday and it was all normal.
However, since my initial visit I feel I've had A LOT of gas / trapped wind, followed by bouts of not what I would call diarrhoea - but definitely a looser than normal bowel movement and I feel like I'm going a lot more than I normally would. My appetite is still good, in fact I feel hungrier than normal.
The pain is not bad - maybe a 2/3 out of 10 and just a constant dull ache. A hot water bottle relieves it to an extent, as does paracetamol.
I haven't changed my diet, nothing seems to trigger it. Does this sound like IBS? And if not does anyone know what it could be? My irrational thinking leads me to bowel cancer but I am only 21, vegetarian and run 20 miles a week - so somewhat unlikely.

"Long story short -
I have sore abdominal pain (mainly lower right) that sometimes comes with gas. I've gotten stabbing pain sometimes. It sometimes moves to my sides, lower back, pelvic area, thighs. Usually in the back, pelvic area, and thighs, it feels more tingly. It started about four months ago. It lasted the first time for almost two weeks I believe. Now it's more of an on off thing, but has been recently happening more frequently lately; which has got me worried.

"Hi I've been suffering with IBS since having my gall bladder out a few yrs ago and tried a few different medications and none have worked. I get frequent diarrhoea at least a few times a day if not more depending on what I've eaten. The triggers are chicken cheese white bread mince egg and some drinks like orange cordial and some alcohol spirits. The medication I have tried is buscopan dicocloverine spasmonal & phos. I have also been prescribed increased doses of each and nothing has worked. Co-codamol works as a short-term option but I don't want to nor do I use it daily. Any suggestions??

"Hello fellow patients,
      I want to start off my giving a background story of my problem. In early July (6 months ago) I started having dull, flank (maybe spasism) like pain in my right upper quadrant side. It has been bothering me almost every day for the past 6 months. I think I also have a very mild case of constipation due to the fact that I have stopped chewing tobacco too since then. This all started from a heavy night of drinking Rye Whiskey 2 nights in a row ( I don't drink a ton but a fair amount for 21-year-old but have really stopped drinking since July) The pain doesn't have a specific time when it starts or stops and doesn't revolve around when I eat or not. It's quite random but its consistent and annoys me enough to take a toll on my everyday life. I'm almost sure it is an IBS problem (spastic colon) because I have no other symptoms (as I said I'm very healthy and normal). Around Thanksgiving I had a CT scan that showed nothing other than backed-up stool. CT scan showed that I have no liver problems, gall bladder, or kidney issues.  I've tried everything like Metamucil, Citrcel, IBgard, and FDgard. What seems to trigger it is coffee and alcohol, but not right away, maybe 12-24 hours later. I've really cut coffee and alcohol out of my diet but the pain still occurs, just a little less. Has anyone had anything like this!? Any suggestions on medications or healing remedies? Do you think it's my colon? Comments, suggestions, and questions are all greatly appreciated! Thank you.

"Hi All,
I am new to this site so please let me know if I miss any relevant information.
I have been suffering with IBS type symptoms for about 4 months now. My symptoms include:
- Sudden need to go to the toilet after eating (number 2)
- Very bad stomach pains when going for a number 2
- Finding it difficult to empty bladder completely
- Constant dull pain in my stomach area
- Very bad stomach pains during/after eating
- Pelvic pains during/after intercourse
I have gone to my doctor regarding the above symptoms and she has sent me for blood tests to check for IBS and an ultrasound to check for any ovarian cysts (even though she has said it's very unlikely to be either of these).
She has perscribed me Laxido orange and wants to see if it ""clears me out"". I am very reluctant to take it as I have read up that this is a laxitive for constipation. I am the exact opposite of being constipated and am worried this stuff will make my toilet habits/stomach pains even worse than they are already.
Please can you advise me on what you think and if I should start taking the laxido sachets?
Thanks.

"Hi,
Over the past 7 days I've been having blood in my stool and in the toilet. I've been to my GP and provided a stool sample. I've been awaiting the results, but i was in pain yesterday and the amount of blood in the toilet had increased a lot. So i went to the A&E where they did the usual checks and weren't able to detect any blood in my back passage, so they said it was further up. Fortunately they had the results from my stool sample and the doctor said the tests had come back clear of infection. They did a blood test and said my hemoglobin was OK, and that i hadn't lost much blood. The Doctor said to visit my GP if the pain and blood persists.
I plan to visit my GP Tuesday as the pain and blood is not going away. I'm slightly confused as there is an obvious problem but the tests have come back OK? No infection is a good thing right? so what is causing me this pain and all this blood?
Symptoms:
- Severe bloating.
- Abdominal pain.
- Pain whilst food is digesting.
- Needing the toilet 6 + times a day.
- Stool hasn't been solid for 7 days straight.
- Blood in stool. Purple/Dark red, and also fresh blood.
- This will be TMI but my stool smells fishy and there has been mucus.
I really hope someone can help, and appreciate any replies.
Thank you.

"I have Aspergers and Social Anxiety and on top of that IBS. My anxiety and depression are made worse by my IBS symptoms. After every meal I experience obvious discomfort, tightness and bloating in my lower abdomen that gives me the slight urge I need to go to the toilet. This feeling makes me much more sensitive to touch (eg. clothes, wind brushing against me) - not a common symptom it seems. I also have flat, broken up stools and incomplete evacuation everytime I use the toilet. When I go out, how productive I am, how much fun I have, how much sleep I get ect. is largely dependant on how my gut feels that day. I've been spending at least a couple of hours a day in front of the computer searching endlessly for causes of, remedies for and people suffering from the same problem I have. I've tried so many things to get relief; fibre suppliments, probiotics, digestive enzymes, L-Glutamine, Movicol, Kefir, stuff the doctor prescribed and all of it has little or no effect. I've had a blood test done for celiac and stool sample for inflammation which were both negative. I've thought about getting a colonoscopy but I have a trip to Europe coming up very soon with family and I'm not sure I'll get to book the appointment in soon enough. I'm very stressed about the trip as I know it's going to be very difficult to enjoy in my state. I'm now starting the low FODMAP diet and praying for results. I've also been going for a daily jog/excercise, despite my discomfort. Honestly though, I'm not expecting any results, I'm nearly ready to give up. My suicidal thoughts are back and I feel like crying. I just want to be able to have normal bowel function, is that too much to ask?

"Hi, my names Jess and I am 20 years old, when I was 19 I had my gallbladder removed and since then have suffered with abdominal pain which in September was confirmed to me to be IBS. I suffer badly with abdominal pain and constipation. I get really bad wind and bloating. I am struggling to find triggers other than lack of sleep or stress. I do find the ibs makes me extremely tired most of the time. I have tried buscopan, ppi's and peppermint oil tablets but none seem to work for me. I am now taking pro biotics daily but still have pain, I don't find that I get the pain more after food so I'm finding it hard to figure out what to eat and what not to.

"Hi, a few years ago i was on a downward spiral to bad ibs and health anxiety, convinced it was ny worst fear i was too and from the doctors, despite 2 ultrasounds, various full blood tests, endoscopy and a very promising visit to a gastro specialist, i was never fully confident. My gastro has even told ne it is for sure ibs and that it is not the worst in terms of what it could be, i am only 31 years old...i moved country in search of relief and got it, i went 8 months without worry and the pain seemed to go. I then had a nightmare in november about my health, after a month of worry and stress in which my health anxiety seemed to rear its ugly head, the stomach pains started again and have been with me for a month now.....
The pain is roaming, never in 1 place, sometimes a dull ache above the belly button bt below the chest, at times a shooting pain to the left of that, at times raw pain in lower abs...however i only saw the gastro 1 year ago who told me i was fine and if i am worried about the worst, i should only start screening at 45 onwards...this is hw confident he was. It seems like my anxiety has triggered a bout and i am suffering more as i am constantly thinking about what else it could be rather than working on managing the ibs.....does this sound like im being way too health cautious? I am drivinf myself crazy as i dont want to start going to and from the doctors every week only to have the pains continue and to be told its ibs....any advice woukd be great.

"Hi all,
I'm desperate for some help.
I was diagnosed with ibs about 5 years ago, biggest issue was cramping after eating which was relieved with a bowel movement. FODMAP diet and mezavant allowed me to get my ibs under control - things were pretty good.
Then I was diagnosed with a chronic anal fissure in September - I have never been in such hellish pain. I had a colonoscopy (all clear!) in late November and began to improve shortly after, avoiding surgery.
Soon after my colonoscopy, I began developing lots of gas and some diarrhea - I would belch every second for an hour or two during the day.
Since the beginning of December this has only become worse - I belch or pass gass all day, almost every second, explosively. I have severe stomach cramps and pain that have sent me to the ER twice. I have very bad diarrhea everyday. This is causing the fissure to act up again. I also often see strings of white or brown ""mucous"" when I have a bowel movement.
Ova and parasite and other stool tests have all been negative - but I suspect a parasite or giardia. On my suspicions, my doctor prescribed me flagyl for a 10 day course (I'm on the 4th day and no improvement). I cannot get in to see a gastroenterologist despite the fact that I am already a patient. The emergency room sends me home with buscopan and tells me to see a gastro.
My diet consists of gluten free bread, bananas, a little peanut butter, maybe some oats. I've been diagnosed with ibs in the past and these have always been safe foods for me. I've never had these symptoms to this degree with ibs, especially the diarrhea.
Anybody have a similar experience? I need some help - I've lost my job, had to quit school in the middle of master's degree, have gone from extremely fit (working out 6 days a week, weightlifting and running - I was a personal trainer) to sitting on the couch or in bed all day because I'm in so much pain. This has also caused a break up between my boyfriend of three years and I. I need relief

They want to remove it.  I want to make sure it will fix me.

"I am begining to think that IBS is a lot to do with thinking.
If you are like me and worry a lot about things I think it makes you more prone to IBS. Perhaps worry actually changes the chemistry in our bowel which is why eating certain foods suddenly becomes a problem to us.
Life is very stressful today, we were never designed to cope with so many problems coming at us from all directions. We are expected to do more and more without any consideration for ourselves.
I think it is a good idea to make time to rest without any interference from outside sources.
Switch the phone off, don't bother to answer the door and just relax a while doing what ever you want to do.
This is what I intend to try this year.

"Was diagnosed with c. diff in early October after several rounds of antibiotics. Believe it has been cleared after three rounds of medication but still have concerning GI issues that I think/hope are Pi-IBS (post infectious IBS) but my health anxiety has me panicked over IBD.
My current symptoms are alternating constipation (2-3 days) then soft but formed bowel movements (1-5 times a day). With these bowel movements, often feel I am not ""finished"" and may push more out later in the day. This is also accompanied by a pressure/fullness feeling in my rectum. In addition, have mild bloating, gas, belching, increased urination, and occasional mild cramps and assorted pains in different areas. Have had no blood since before my c. diff diagnosis (doctor thought it was an anal fissure), no fever, and no joint pain.
Am currently taking a fiber supplement, probiotic, drinking kefir, and trying to drink a lot of water. Also on Zoloft to try and help with my increased anxiety.
My GI wants to do a colonoscopy to rule out IBD or microscopic colitis even though she thinks this is PI-IBS. Recent blood work was normal.

"Hi everyone,
Does anyone else here suffer with prolonged pain following a BM? I have IBS-C so my frequency of BMs is a bit all over the place. Without a doubt, the worst symptom I experience is pain. I could possibly cope with chronic constipation if it didn't cause me pain but it does. If I go to the toilet, my bowel will feel sore for a long time afterwards, sometimes 1-2 days. I should say this is abdominal rather than rectal pain. More recently the pain is down my left side though it has been on my right and around my belly button occasionally. This type of pain occurs only after a BM which makes me think it is a mechanical issue, maybe spasms or gas displacing? I don't know. It feels like somebody has scraped a scoured along the length of my descending colon. Also the pain is worse the bigger the stool is (sorry to be tmi).
Does anyone get this, know what might be causing it or take anything for it? I'm at my wits end with it.
Thank you.

"I am cured.
I have been suffering with IBS for 12 years.  I take Cholestyramine powder daily for my symptoms.  My energy has been dramatically decreased over the past many years and I am always nervous when I go into a public place for fear of a, or multiple bathroom visits.  When the cramping starts I have no more than 3 minutes to find a commode.
Something change dramatically a week ago. 
I came down with a severe ear infection in one ear and an ear ache in the other during Thanksgiving week.  I went to my local urgent care clinic where I was given a strong dose of Amoxicillin.  I was prescribed two (2) pills, three (3) times a day or 6 pills daily for five (5) days.  Just as I was finishing the pills my wife and three sons came down with the flu.  I was the last one sick as I got it on Christmas day.
During the flu something happened that was very concerning.  Along with the vomiting, my diarrhea was milky (white).  I noticed it was mucus and there was a lot of it.  I almost went to the emergency room because it was so concerning.  Once my flu left me I decided not to take my medicine until my stomach/diarrhea told me otherwise.  I am a week out and I have still not had to take my medicine.  My bloating has ceased and my stomach feels very differently.  I haven't seen a normal stool in years, until recently.  I am no medical professional but I feel moved to share this because I know what people are going through.  I never thought to pray about my problem until recently because it has interfered with my work and my time with family.  I hope this helps someone.

"Hi all,
I was wondered what experiences people had with getting H Pylori testing? Can you request it from your GP and were they reasonably sympathetic to the request? My symptoms are both upper and lower GI, reflux, dyspepsia, fullness, left and right abdominal ache, gas, some constipation and some undigested food. I had an endoscopy 3 years ago which came out normal and I didn't ask about H Pylori, however my digestive symptoms have worsened significantly since then.
I've eliminated many foods to no avail, to the point were I was malnourished from such a restricted diet. I know I struggle with dairy, bulk fiber, eggs, gluten and night shades.

"I'll try to be quick.
I am a 27 year old male in excellent physical shape and currently on an intense workout regime and diet. I do have Hyperthyroidism and take .2 mcg of Synthroid (Levothyroxine) daily. I have had 5+ hemorrhoid bandings, 2 Colonoscopies and a flexsig with Biopsy with zero findings.
Diet does not have any restrictions. I consume dairy, all meats, lots of protein, etc. I do not drink or smoke, and I consume over a gallon of water a day.
 In 2013 during a heavy drinking and party stage, I had an upset stomach and a heavy straining bowel movement accompanying my hangover one morning. Later that day I felt an incontinence/wet feeling in my rectal area, and I had never experienced anything like it before. Ever since then the issue has gotten worse. My symptoms are as follows:
 SWEATING in the rectal area even with light movements. Within minutes of being in the gym I can make a full imprint on a bench. I can sit on a leather type chair and minutes later stand up with a sweat mark.
MILD BLEEDING when I wipe a few times a week. This is probably hemorrhoids from my heavy lifting routine.
INCOMPLETE BOWEL RELIEF most of the time. I will stand up and feel as tho I did not get it all out, and especially at the gym. I know the straining is part of the problem, but I have to take a couple of trips to the restroom in the gym after a heavy set and try to squeeze some out.
ANXIETY. This is hard to explain. I am a Marine, an athlete, and generally just not afraid of anything, however, I seem to get anxiety or nervous feelings that could almost be confused with a slight bit of paranoia. Take that for what it's worth.
MUCUS bowel movements. I will go to the bathroom and only patches of mucus or some sort of bubbly jelly looking substance comes out.
I have seen multiple G.I. Doctors, Rectal specialist, and primary care physicians and no one has a reason. The only symptom I care about is the sweating. PLEASE do not tell me to use tissue or baby powder. I am aware of counter measures that can be taken, but I know that there has to be a fix. If I was once without these symptoms; then it can be done again.
I always go back to the drinking because it all started when I was consuming LOTS of Jack Daniels every day. Thanks in advance. I did not mean any of this in a rude way.

"Hello - I have had stomach issues for years now and have had several diagnostic tests including two colonoscopies, and two endoscopies. Grandmother died of rectal cancer at age 49.  I recently had blood tests that came back normal except for elevated cholesterol and triglycerides.
My GI doctor said I have non-ulcer dyspepsia and don't need to be seen for a colonoscopy until I'm 50 (I'm 43). 
I have a history of heavy drinking (off and on) and I worry this may be causing these issues - although liver panel came back normal in both June and in late November. Most recently I have experienced constant gurgling and rumbling all over my stomach area - especially after eating.
Anyway - any info would help. It just doesn't feel like I am properly digesting food.
My friends think I'm a hypochonriac and keep telling me I have IBS, and that its nothing serious. 
Anyway - any info or advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you!

"I have had , like so many , a bad case of IBS for around 10 years after hitting my forties . Massive bloating , abdominal pains , pains to my upper gut , constipation , wind you name it i had it. Often even migraine.
Doctors advised nothing can be done except help by cutting out troublesome foods (wheat was the worst, Soy sauce was like absolutle poison)
Anyway my story is this . Purely by chance I was in business in India and chatting in a hotel bar to a fellow resident who was receiving treatment in a local clinic for the same problems as I have . He was there on recomendation from a friend who had been cured .
I listened and decided the £5 consultation fee was worth a go and visited the clinic myself .
I decided that as I was in such a bad way I would go for some treatment  .
Leaving the hotel each day at 7am for a 10km scooter ride and 2.5 hours of different massages for 3 days , I then had a stomach treatment of ghee. (not very pleasant but not as bad as I imagined)
3 more days of massages and semi fasting (veg soup and plain rice only) I went back to the clinic to be purged .
My first day of eating (when I returned to the UK) I decided to go for it. I ordered Cod in Batter and chips . My first for at least 9 years.
Not a hint of a problem .
I now eat without thinking for one moment of wheat content etc.
I am not a doctor , some people may scoff about unknown treatments , but for me it has worked brilliantly.
Basically my whole insides were slowly cleansed and cleaned out from the stomach all the way through the intestines and gut digestion process whilst getting my head and body balanced .
It honestly feels like a miracle.!!
Everyones case is very different reading this forum, but at least I can offer that sometimes  there just might be a cure out there for you depending on your conditions .!

"I got diagnosed with ibs when I was 12 (even though I didn't have any tests or scans the doctors said it was that once I told them my current symptoms at that time)
For a while eating less fried foods worked a lot.
Then after about a year I had to cut out white bread pasta and potatoes.
Then all of a sudden about 2 years ago I had a really bad ibs attack with a horrid burning sensation in my instetines and had to have an ambulance through fear that something was really wrong. Turnt out I was anxious which was triggering my ibs to flare up.
Anyway, for those past two years I've had on and off burts of bleeding when passing stool.. occasional very bad abdominal pains, what I will describe weakness In bowl muscles and a lot of nausia.
With ibs I know constipation and lose stools are common but it's permanent, never have a day with a normal toilet habit and do occasionally have mucus in my stool.
Anyway, I've always had on and off fears over the last few years that it may be a twist in my intestines or worse cancer of some sort between my instestines and bowl. But I've always had to calm myself and say ""it's just my ibs"" as as far as I am aware all of my symptoms are ibs.
But I read this morning a woman died 5 days after finding out she had cancer after being miss diagnosed with ibs for years.
Now I'm worrying even more as my mother and father have both had more than one type of cancer although not hereditary.
I want to go to the doctor and get scans and tests to rule out cancer or other serious conditions but I'm at a loss because I have a sort of health anxiety and I feel like they will refuse to do tests and say it's just my anxiety, when really there could be something wrong.
I really don't know what to do any advice will be appreciated

"I was diagnosed with IBS 3 months ago. The Gastroenterologist recomended I start the low-FODMAP diet. The diet dramatically helped with bloating. However, I still experience the following:
- Deep deep sleep / low energy
- Wake up feeling groggy (feel a little better after going to the toilet)
- Brain fog / reality feels surreal 
- 2-3 bowel movements a day (formed), feel dizzy/lightheaded if there's a stool 'in the pipeline'
- Tingling hands/hair loss/sparse eyebrows ... which I put down to my low-folate/vitamin B12 deficiency (been told by the doctor)
- Can feel 'OK' for part of the day, but then have a relatively sudden DRAMATIC mood change where I feel depression kick in and experience anxiety attacks. It feels like a chemical imbalance is triggered. I begin to feel physically terrible (like death) and can look at myself in the mirror and think 'ive got a serious illness that has been misdiagnosed because I look and feel so terrible'...but then when the 'episode' passes (which can take just hours or up to 24hrs), I feel and look better. What the hell?!
I feel like I'm trapped in my own private nightmare because I can never quite articulate how bad I feel when I get these 'episodes'. Therefore, I'm writing in the hope that someone else can relate or offer some advice?!
*I have received CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) for the anxiety. However, my issue feels more like a chemical imbalance or absorption of toxins that triggers negative thoughts / mood disorder
**I am currently completely eliminating dairy and gluten as I think dairy in particular is not being tolerated 
***I was treated with 3 x sets of antibiotics for gut parasites (which worked for one of the two bugs) prior to being diagnosed with IBS. 
Please tell me this will pass and will return to some form of normality soon?!

"Okay, so about 3 weeks ago I started getting really nauseas and had to vomit alot. This lasted for about a week and my symptoms subsided, but a couple days later I started getting alot of new symptoms. I feel like I have to go to the bathroom alot and when I get there i won't be able to go, I have narrower stools, stomach pain that comes and goes, more mucos in my stool, and im having far less bowel movements than I usually do(about 3 times a day) and now I go once in the morning. Also in the morning when I go to the bathroom i'll pass alot of stool, but it is narrow like i said above but sometimes its not and i have stools of regular thickness. Ive found that when I drink lots of water and take a fiber supplement in the morning the stomach pain goes away.
In the last 3 days i've started getting more symptoms though. These include lots of noise coming from my stomach when I lay down on my back, neasau, heartburn, and vomiting in the morning, but I dont actually vomit anything up I just get the vomiting like motion. Ive also had a decrease in apetite in the morning in the past 3 weeks, when i wake up I wont feel very hungry but after a hour or so i'll start eating and then i'll have my apetite again. My most serious symptom I think is that 2 days ago I had dark/black looking stool, the night before I had eaten about 14oz of steak and so that might be the reason but the dark stool went away that day and hasn't recurred. So those are all of my symptoms and i think I have IBS, but im not entirely sure because of these most recent syymptoms. If anyone could respond and let me know if these are regular IBS symptoms that would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you

"Hi, I am 21 years old and have been experiencing a. lot of stomach pain. I have had diarrhea and constipation with blood in my stool. I have been nauseous and I have been experiencing a lot of heartburn as well.
I have had a colonoscopy that was pointing towards Crohn's disease because of the erosions in my large bowel. I went to have a endoscopy test done next the reveled more erosions in my esophagus. I was put on a persciption strength Nexium which I still am on.
I still have not been feeling better so recently my doctor had me swallow the PillCam to see into my small bowel to deterime if my Crohn's was there. After the results came back my doctor said everyting looked normal and even though Crohn's might still be a possibility there is nothing further that he can do to make that decision.
He has not said that I have IBS, however, he gave me papers saying to follow a Low FODMAP diet which I have been doing since the 8th of December.
I have a few questions:
Everything I am Googling suggests that only people with IBS are placed on the diet. Does that mean I have IBS?
My doctor told me to eliminate foods from my diet, however, my next appointment is the end of March. According to what I have Googled I shouldn't be eliminating food for that long, however, he never gave me instructions on how to reintroduce foods or when to. What is going on here?
Finally, the list I was given on foods to avoid differs from what people are saying online. Which should I stick to?
Thank you so much!!

"Hi everyone,
I've been experiencing gut issues for about eight months and was officially diagnosed IBS-C in October. I've been trying lots of different things and not really got anywhere.
My latest thought is, is it related to periods? I have a dull discomfort/pain from being constipated pretty much all the time, but every so often I will get a particularly severe attack where I cramp very badly for several days. It is a noticeably different kind of pain. I have been keeping notes on a calendar of my symptoms, and as today is the start of a new attack, I thought I would look at my last attack. It was around a month ago. I am due a period in a few days. Could there be a connection?
I do not think it is food related, at least not majorly. I do not experience cramps after eating vast majority of the time, just pain from stretched bowels being constipated. I do not eat particularly healthily or plentifully, admittedly. I also have an anxiety disorder; I think there's a link here because I could go for a few days being able to open my bowes but if I get stressed everything locks up again.
I'd never had much PMS before my IBS began in April this year. I did take the pill for a month between
Feb - March which made me feel poorly so I stopped it. Couple of weeks later I started with pains which were eventually diagnosed IBS.

"Hi there,
Currently under consultant for suspected IBS, I wanted to share recent experiences to see if this resonates with anyone?
I started off with issues relating to feelings of bloating in upper abdomen, which came and went. I had endoscopy which found 2cm hiatal hernia. I've been on 30mg daily PPI for just coming up to a year, but have had for periods before this (for GERD).
I do get the odd day where I get a bit of pain and need to go to toilet, have been through the usual of FODMAP and also taken probiotics but haven't really seemed to get to the bottom of that.
Recently, the feelings of bloating have become more frequent and consistent. There is no feeling of pain, more of discomfort. Going to the toilet doesn't seem to always relieve it. I was fairly active before, but I find it difficult to do strenuous exercise due to the feeling. Walking/going up stairs is fine.
Other notes are that I am regular (don't need to strain), don't have stomach / ab pain or obvious lumps (so kind of ruling out any kind of hernia??), I have passed a nuclear feeding test, and samples have come back ok for H. Pylori. Any blood is extremely infrequent, and always fresh.
All these things do tick the boxes for IBS, and don't as a collection seem to suggest anything else, but I just wondered if anyone was ot there feeling similar, and what you might try to relieve?
Many Thanks

"I've had minor IBS for about 12 years now, although it comes and goes. About 2 years ago, it was causing me stomach aches (central, pretty much underneath my tummy button area), rumbling gurgly noises and a need to go to the toilet. This was happening fairly regularly, so I started making changes to my diet, with the biggest change being going gluten free.
This seemed to make a difference, and I've actually been relatively fine for the last few years. Whenever I eat gluten now, I get some gurgly noises again, but I'm not sure if that's like a reverse placebo effect!
Anyway, my current problem;
About 2 weeks ago, I developed my ache in my right side, just above my hip bone, positioned in line with my tummy button. It was a weird ache, it was uncomfortable, and it felt almost exactly like a stitch pain. It was heavy and dull ache. The odd thing was, I couldn't make it worse by stretching or twisting or bending over, or pushing in on it. I thought it might be a muscle thing but surely that would hurt when I moved in a funny position?
The ache never got worse and was intermittent, so I left it for 10 days. Some days were fine with no ache at all, and others, it ached pretty much constantly, but never got more painful.
The last 2 days have changed a little bit. The ache is a fraction more painful and is now constant, and it feels like an area of my stomach is swollen. It doesn't look it, but it feels like it's bigger than the left side. I've tried to draw exactly where the ache and swollen area is:
http://s24.postimg.org/h62utapvl/Surface_projections_of_the_organs_of_the_trunk.jpg
http://s22.postimg.org/baew65cal/Diagram_of_human_abdomen.jpg
It feels like someone has punched me in that area.
So, my question is:
- Do you think this could be normal IBS? My bowels movement are consistent with IBS at the moment but I've never had this type of ache or swollen feeling
- Could it be anything more serious like a mass in my abdomen, or the ""start"" of appendix problems, or a intestine/colon issue? I don't actually know what organs are in the highlighted areas on my pictures - could someone explain what's there? It looks like the ""ascending colon""?
- I did go and see the doctor, who examined me, pushed in on my entire stomach area, raised my legs up and down, and checked for lumps in groin, took my temperature and pulse, and said nothing was wrong.
- There are no other symptoms at all really. My temperature is fine, blood pressure fine, appetite fine, I can walk and run with no aches, there's no blood anywhere (he checked urine), my bowel movements are IBS-like but not severely so - I wouldn't call it diarrhea or constipation, it's fairly regular, and although loose, it's not diarrhea levels - ,there's no noticable swelling or bruising or lumps anywhere, and the ache isn't strong enough to require painkillers. I guess all of those things are good!
- Could this simply be health anxiety ""creating"" the pains? Obviously, it does worry me, and I keep reading about appendicitis or abdomen masses/cancers, especially the ones that don't have much symptoms, like stomach or colon cancer. Can anyone reassure me?
- How long do you think I should leave it now before going back to the doctors?
Thanks in advance.

"For a couple of years, I have had endless excruciating bowel problems. The symptoms (which I'd rather not go into, but feel I have to, at least briefly!) are endless bouts of diarrhoea, with pale-brown poo, accompanied by acute pains in my intestines. I think the pain is in my large intestine, especially on the right. These symptoms are accompanied by really loud churning sounds in my stomach. Sometimes it is the wrong food (e.g. chilly) that sets it off, sometimes it is just food per se! In any given week, the days when I have normal poo, are outnumbered 6 to 1 by the days when I don't. Sometimes I have good patches, when it's fine for a week or so, but it always comes back, and 'bad' is normal for me. 
When my symptoms got so bad, and due to a very high faecal calprotectin test result, it was assumed I had IBD and I was referred for endless tests, biopsies…the lot. Only, they all came back negative. Which, I suppose, is really good news!  However, I know there is something wrong and the pain and symptoms (and I suspect raised faecal calprotectin level) continue, so I am worried that something may have been missed.

"Hello everyone!  I am a new member of this site and I would be grateful if you could help me with a health problem of mine.
I am 22 years old. Five years ago, when I had to go through our national examinations to go to University, a problem appeared. I started farting at an unusual rate. I thought it was anxiety, so I did not visit a doctor asap. Instead, I waited for my examination period to end before I get an expert's opinion. I was then given some pills. ""Ibutin"" and ""Silactis"" are the ones  I remember after all those years. I think I've taken other medication as well, but unfortunately I don't remember their names. Nothing helped. In addition, when the air does not find a way out from ""the bottom side"", it goes up and gets out from the mouth (aka burping). Over the years I've managed to somehow control it, but it still is painful. Most doctors say it's actually Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is magnified by anxiety.Or anxiety which CAUSED the IBS. However noone has really helped me get rid of the problem. Any ideas?
Thanks a lot for your time!

"Hi Guys,
Sorry in advance if I seem as I am rambling but I don’t normally do things like this. I was diagnosed with IBS 2 years ago; however I believe that I have had it for a lot longer, but being a typical man refused to go to the doctors. I went through a whole load of test & examinations before IBS was finally confirmed. As with other that have posted here I am by nature a nervous/anxious person, I also a very private person, which is why doing something like this is so hard.
My doctors was great the whole time that they were investigating the problem, but I feel that since it was diagnosed he has lost interest and now falls into the category of you have IBS there’s nothing else to do live with it. I am now on so many tablets I am sure that I rattle when I walk. I suffer from bouts of constipation followed by diarrhoea, with sever abdominal pains, nausea, excessive sweating and wind, dizziness my symptoms are not always so disabilitating, which brings me to where I need some advice.
Ever since I left school some 24 years ago, I have always worked and work has been my life, to the extent that I don’t really have any friends and don’t think twice about working long hours when asked. My wife & daughter have been absolutely brilliant support during this, however it now looks that because of my IBS, I am going to lose the one thing outside of my family that I live for, [b:e1d86ab6da]my job[/b:e1d86ab6da]. Even with all the tablets I take and precautions that I take with what I eat etc, over the past 18 months I have only managed an 87% attendance and have been informed by my manager that the company does not find this acceptable, I am currently off work again, with my IBS, however I have been told that when I return I will be going into a disciplinary hearing regarding the level of my attendance. I have kept my employer full informed due the full period of the both the investigations and subsequent absences. I don’t know what I would do if I lost my job as well as having IBS, I believe that this new twist is causing me to become extremely depressed, or more than normal at least, with the thought of after 7 years with the same company they can just throw you out the door for something that is out of my control.
I would appreciate any advice that anybody can give me on either ways I can stay in my current job or how other people with IBS manage working with IBS.
Thanks for reading this I have to say actually sitting down and writing it has made me feel a little better.

"About three years ago I went home early from dinner with stomach discomfort. The pain has never gone away since that night but only increased in intensity (it also decreases at times but it is always there). There was no pattern (type of pain, area of stomach) but now I would best describe it as bloating and cramping and it is usually in my lower abdomen but at times extends to under the rib cage. At times it has been so severe that I have been tempted to call an ambulance where I can barely breathe and scream out if anyone touches my stomach. A few months later I developed lower back pain and leg pain. The pain in my back is right at the tailbone and can best be described as aching. Standing up for long periods of time further exacerbates it. The leg pain is mostly in my thighs and extends to my hips. It is sharpy and stabbing and feels like a very painful case of restless leg syndrome. I have met with countless gastros who tell me it is IBS and I just need to live with it, I have worked with a several different homeopathic doctors who have put me on strict diets and tons of supplements, have tried acupuncutre, massage and yoga and am currently working with a psychiatrist and internist who are convinced the pain is a result of my depression anxiety when in fact the depression/anxiety is a result of the pain. I have done every diet imaginable (and for extended amounts of time) and at one point consumed only bone broth for 23 straight days to which my symptoms were not alleviated. Constipation has been something I have dealt with since I was a child but consume copious amounts of water, take Magnesium Citrate in the form of Calms, flax seed, eat clean with no processed food or sugar, probiotics, exercise and I typically go once a day which improves symptoms temporarily. Occasionally I have no choice but to do a saline enema to get some pain relief. I have been tested for every GI disorder there is as well as MRIs, scans, SIBO tests, celiac testing, food allergy testing etc. I've become severely depressed, isolated and anti-social as a result. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I went to my doctor yesterday and he wants to run some tests but then he concerned me when he said he would like to do a head scan if nothing comes up in the other tests, his words were ""there could be something bad up there causing you the nausea"".

"I have IBS-D which is usually triggered by stress. This morning I had a couple of loose stools in response to a stressful situation and took one Imodium. Usually, this stops me up for at least a day, but I already had another bowel movement only 12 hours later. It wasn't loose, but I thought it was strange. I recently moved from Norway to the US, and so I'm wondering if maybe there's a difference between what's in the drug in the two countries? The pills in the US are definitely smaller and they dissolve a lot quicker - once when I took it, I could taste it at the back of m'y throat which never happened with the pills I got in Norway. Is there any other explanation for this?

"About a year ago I started having changes in my stool and bowel movements. I have always been very regular and all of a sudden I had lots of gas and thin stools, constipated stools, all sorts of small different shapes (sorry to be graphic) and after a few months it went away. Over the last year it has come and gone 3-4 times. I have no other symptoms other than when it happens I feel like I have to go all the time. I am petrified that I have cancer and was wondering if this was cancer or IBS. I am getting scheduled for a colonoscopy which I have never had one. I am 57 years old. I do have an enormous amount of stress in my life.I did not know if cancer would have shown other symptoms by now.

"I've had this happen to me maybe 4-5 times within the last year. I've been having this pain in my stomach on and off. It's in my upper stomach to the right, under my rib cage. It seems like it happens a lot after eating too much greasey food. It sometimes lasts for days and is on and off. It's not severe pain, maybe like 2/10. If causes a minor annoyance when I mover or press on my stomach in certain areas. I always get gassy during this time through both ends which relieves it. I'm a male in my 30s about 120 lbs. I've always been underweight, I've never had a normal appetite. I'm a very picky eater but have eaten a lot of high sugar, fat, and sodium foods over the years. I've done some reading and to me it seems like it could be gallstones. I'm hoping it's just simple indigestion. Calcium carbonate does not help. I'm ready to completely change my diet as much as I hate cooking. Don't think I could go the vegetarian route but going to cut out greasey foods. A couple days ago I had a Stouffer's family size lasagna all to myself. I been having on/off pain ever since just like before. I'm scared it could be my gall bladder. I go to the Drs twice a year but don't have insurance so don't like to go except for my regular checkups. I also get a lot of anxiety from it which I have a history of along with depression. I take meds but they only help to an extent. I'm hoping it's just some kind of indigestion but being on the right side more scares me a lot. I didn't ask my Dr about it last appt because it went away so I thought it was just indigestion and didn't really think of it. Also had a question, when you get pain from gall stones can it go away on it's own or will it stay there until you get them removed. Is it true they can sometimes dissolve on their own over time? I have a really bad needle phobia and am deathly afraid of having surgery. Thanks

"Hi,
I have had a problem for almost 2 years now.
It started off with me feeling really sick, loose bowels, bit off food for a few days.  It went then went away (I assumed I had a virus).  However it kept coming back, getting more severe and lasting for longer periods.  The nausea so overwhelming I struggle to eat, causing me to lose so much weight, even waking me up at night.  I also have more wind than usual.  In particular it seems to be right after my dinner at times, I begin to feel really sick and have lots of wind.  It can happen with anything I eat.  Some times I eat the same food and I am fine, and other times I am not.  My bowels are much lighter in colour than they use to be, really loose and sometimes the urgency to go.  When I am feeling really sick I can go several times. 
I have had lots of tests done in hospital (Barium Swallow, Endoscopy, CT Scan of head, MRI of small bowel, Ultrasound scan, Gut Hormone Test, H.Pylori test, Coeliac test, Thyroid test, XRay of Stomach - showed inflamation of small bowel), they concentrated mainly on my stomach due to me feeling sick however all tests have been negative. 
A doctor said it may be IBS however they have not even checked my bowel to see if anything else could be wrong.  Should they not investiagte my bowel before just diagnosing me?!  I was given Buscopan which didn't help me at all.  I do not have any pain or cramps or bloating or diarrhea.  I do not believe it is IBS!!  Help?!  Should they investiagate further?  What other tests could be done?

"Hi
I have not been feeling at all well for a long time.
Numerous symptoms so GP checked me out and when he pressed under my right rib and took a deep breath, I felt a very sudden sharp pain under my left rib.  Has anyone had this, curious as to what it could be?
Also, just had an endoscopy and the report states:
Site a: Fundus
small haemorrhagic area
Large volume of bile stained fluid in stomach, removed with suction.
Hpylori test was negative.
Now just waiting on GP fllow up and advice.
Eveything I seem to eat makes me go clammy and feel sick, with pain under both ribs and severe bloating which is very uncomfortable.
I binge drink on a Sunday afternoon and a Monday evening, (roughly 6-8 pints of lager on both days) rest of the week don't touch alcohol at all.
I have an ultrasound booked in for a few days before xmas.
What would or can this show if they are looking in the abdomen area.
The small bleed in the stomach has worried me a little, as too the large volume of bile in the stomach.
Was sedated during the proces and I have had nausea and diarrohea for the last 2 days - is this normal due to the sedative?
Sorry for all questions, just would like to know if anyone else been through the same symptoms and could it be IBS, or to do with liver and pancreas?
Much appreciated!

"Hey folks,
wanted to vent and ask.  Ive been having issues, anxiety and google are bad.. we all kno that by now.  Ive had yellow poop for a while. couple years roughly?  Sometimes it burns when i have a BM. others not so much. I usually go quite a few times, first BM of the day has the largest diameters, usuualy all sinkers. As the BM's continue (30, 60 mins later..or so) they get skinnier. usually with gas.  Lately they've been watery (yuck) but i think its my nerves. i been worked up over this since i started googling.   Ive kinda lost my appetite and gotten run down very badly because im scared that ive got something bad.  Havent been eating much, trying to kick that problem now.  Usually not to much floating.  Occasionally it happens.  THe other day, everything i ate was floating, scared me!!
Weight was pretty steady between 170-180.  Prolly came down a little cause my lack of appetie and my anxiety over this issue..
Ive had acid refulx since i was younger.  Diagnosed with it at like 16, prescribed aciphex for a while.   (31 now) never took much meds for it other than OTC tums n whatnot once meds ran out. (going for a scope this week on upper half)
in june, heart palpitations started so that freaked me out!  dunno what or why.  Stress tests, EKG, heart monitors, all said to be ok other than minor palpitatons and a murmor.  ""Nothing to be worried about"" they claimed.
lately, ive started to have some back pains at about my shoulder blades. Somtimes Right, sometimes left.  Seems to alternate. Abdominal pains come and go, thinking thats gas..somtimes it RUQ.    RLQ by waist line seems to be touchy sometimes.   Lower back like hip areas has been SORE as heck, but i thnk thats from eating a lack of food lately.. malnutrition?
My urine color depends on what i drink.  If i drink pop, tea, coffee, etc its of course yellow. Sometimes dark.  If i drink water like i have been its clear.  I been on the water kick a good bit the past few days and its been staying clear for the most part. Sometimes it foamy, sometimes it not.
Lastnight and night before, ive been having night sweats.  Wake up sweaty and hot.
No yellowing of skin or eyes yet that we can tell.  No itching either.
As for tests, ive had a few done so far. all came back good from doctor.  Sugar, liver enzymes, amylase/lypase, cholesterol, no blood in stool.
Thnking i need to go see a GI doctor or something...current doctor kinda seems stumped..
what do you all think?

"Hello everyone,
I recently posted another thread on this in a different section of the forums under abdominal pain, but I wanted to post my story here to hopefully get some different feedback from people.
I'm a 23 year old male and have been experiencing lower left abdominal pain for the past 6 months. It's a little coincidental seeing as how the pain started developing right after I graduated college. I have been having really bad anxiety for years, but it's been at it's worst recently since I am unemployed and looking for a job. The pain I am experiecing seems to be the most noticeable in the morning. I wake up and press down just to the right of my left hip bone and the best way to describe what I feel is a hard bone like muscle or something that is distended inside my abdomen. When I do press on this area, I feel immediate pain. I do not get this same type of feeling on the right side of my abdomen, nor do I feel a distended type of muscle on that side. The best way I can describe the pain is a more of a dull-achey feeling rather than sharp stabbing pain, but it's definitely noticeable. Even if I don't press in the area, I can still feel that something isn't right. It does however feel temporarily better with a bowel movement, but gradually gets worse as the day goes on. Lastly, I do notice when I press on the affected I hear like a sound liquid moving around in there, or it may be trapped gas?
I've had a colonoscopy, upper GI done recently and those came back clear. I have also had a a CT scan several months ago, also came back clear. The doctors said they saw no signs of Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's or Diverticulitis and are diagnosing this as IBS.
While I feel I do suffer from IBS, I can't help but feel that they missed something. Keep in mind that this pain never stops, I have it 24/7. Is this something that IBS can do? I've also tried being on different meds such as Nortriptyline for the pain, but that didn't help. Is this any other meds that I could possibly try? 
I have been taking 20mg of Prilosec (Omeprazole) for about a year due to having issues with Acid Reflux. I talked with my GI doctor about being on Prilosec long term and he said that it would have no harmful effects. I have been doing research online recently and have found that prolonged used of prilosec could be detrimental to your health, so I am not really sure what to do here. Has anyone else had abdominal pain while taking prilosec? I have tried weaning myself off my taking Prilosec, but unfortunately I had such severe rebound acid reflux that I was forced to go back on the medication. What do you guys recommend I do here? Stay on it, or try a different method to wean off again?
I have always had this issue, but it as become worse over the recent years. I am also taking a probiotic. I have been taking the probiotic for about a month now, but haven't seen any significant improvement for the pain in my abdomen, but it is helping me have bowel movements more frequently. 
Also, recently I've been having trouble with my left ear. I have to constantly keep using the valsalva manuever popping it for it to remain ""open"" and it feels sore deep inside. Does this have anything to do with the abdominal pain that I've been having or is this a separate issue?
Has anyone else had similar experiences? If so, please share and if you have any advice I would love to hear it.
I really appreciate everyone's time to help. I would just love to be out of pain. Thank you so much!

"This may be a long post, so thank you to anyone who takes the time to read through!
I'm 22 years old, female. When I was 16, I started getting odd tummy aches in the morning. After I went to the loo, I felt better. Because I was in sixth form/college, it wasn't always possible for me to go to the toilet when I needed, I got some sort of anxiety whereby I now find small quiet enclosed spaces stressful - incase other people can hear my tummy rumble or I'm particularly gassy.
I never really thought too much of this issue, just that it was an over reaction and eventually I'd forget about it and move on. This hasn't happened annoyingly.
I started uni in 2014, where I had constant bad acid reflux so was put on omeprazole and lansoprazole*. I was told if I did have any tummy issues, these should actually help. For a brief period, they helped the reflux. This year, around march time, I started getting constant upset tummys and feeling generally unwell. I gave in and saw a Dr. in April. I took some tests and it came back positive for h.pylori, so I had a week of strong antibiotics. This brought great relief and I started feeling better.
One week after I finished this medication, I started to feel the same as before but worse. Went back to the drs. and got told the h.pylori may not have been the issue and seems like it could be ibs.
Since then, every dr. tells me it's ibs and offers me something new to try: mebeverine, buscopan, peppermint type medications, immodium. Nothing helps anything; some of them actually make things worse!
Last time I saw a doctor was 2 and half months ago when it was really getting me down, but again they haven't been able to advise more than IBS and send me on my way.
In the past 7 weeks, things have gotten much worse. I've developed new symptoms in that when I try sleep, I get light pins and needles in my hands and feet, constant twitching in my arm muscles, leg muscles and eyes. I don't sleep because of this, it causes my entire body to ache. The tingling sensation doesn't fully go away, even during the day. My legs also become quite stiff when generally walking in the day.
This coupled with my current ibs symptoms of : constant 'raw' feeling inside my stomach, it just feels inflamed continuously? the need to go to the toilet multiple times a day (either in the morning or generally throughout the day), gassy towards the end of the day, intense hunger pain like feeling, feeling sick, stabbing sensation in my lower left abdomen.
I've tried cutting my diet down, tried excerising, tried various tablets and can't find any (even brief) fix.
It's become highly stressful to work with as I feel anxious/exhausted and unwell all the time.
Could this be more than IBS or can anyone else reccomend something that might help slightly?
As you can imagine, since being told it is IBS, I've read A LOT of posts regarding it. I'm not sure if the pains and sleep aches are related to ibs or not?
I could waffle all day regarding this ongoing issue but that's probably enough for now..
Thanks to anyone who replies,
regards

"I am an 18 year old female and I'm desperately hoping that someone is in a similar boat/can shed some light on the subject!
For the past 10 or so years I have struggled with an upset stomach but only in the mornings. Nothing makes it go away, lots of people suggest drinking water or eating to settle my stomach.
Over the last 6 months it has gotten increasingly worse (often visiting the bathroom up to 10 times???) and I've visited the doctor several times. I have tried two different medications for IBS (although stool/blood samples came back clear) and seen no change. I have also tried a FODMAP free diet again to no avail. 
I am worried it may be caused by anxiety but I cannot pinpoint any triggers and I don't have any coping mechanisms. 
Unfortunately, I'm also now suffering from depression due to it's impact on my sports and relationships that I can't maintain due to constant upset stomach and cramps. 
The strangest part of this is that I recently visited Bali for a week and while I away I experienced very mild/almost no symptoms while I was away but as soon as I returned home it was back! 
If it is anxiety, can anyone suggest any ways to deal with the physical symptoms?

"This is maybe a bit of a long question but:
A year or so back I was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) after numerous bloodtests, endoscopies, physical exams, etc. Right after I was diagnosed I obviously did research and tried to figure out the best way to cope with my symptoms, which I feel like I have at this point. However, probably due to a move to a different country and as a result a change in eating habits I had symptoms flare up again recently. This lead me to do research again. 
I found a wikipedia article that said that IBS could be caused by an acute gastroentiritis infection which is often caused by Campylobacter. Can you tell me if wikipedia is right?
Quite a few years ago now I had food poisoning and the doctor's test showed that it was campylobacter. Could this be the reason for my IBS?
I know that it doesn't change anything for me at this point, but it would be nice to get some clarity.

"Please help! I have had sore stomachs or nausea every day for the past nearly 3 weeks. I have always had numerous stomach problems because of my anxiety and emetophobia (fear of throwing up) but it's never been as bad as this. It's all kinds of different pain- nausea/feeling unwell, sore lower stomach, indigestion type feeling, etc. I never actually throw up or feel like I'm going to throw up though. It usually lasts about an hour, give or take. Sometimes it's made worse by eating food, sometimes better. I also have really bad constipation- sometimes all that will come out is tiny, hard bms, or sometimes just a mucous-like substance. Occasionally I will have a more normal (though still clumpy and hard) bowel movement, though very rarely diahrrea. There has been a few times where there has been blood after I wipe, or a drop of blood in the toilet after a bm, though I do not know if this is from a cut or something else. I also sometimes get very bad gas or burping. Please help! Is this irritable bowel syndrome? Anxiety? I'm very scared it's something like stomach cancer! I have had a blood tests about 6 months ago, though it came back clear, and I am not allowed to go to the doctor because my parents don't want to make it a habit to ease my emetophobia whenever I feel slightly off, but I am generally concerned about this!

"Hi everyone,
I wasn't sure whether to put this in IBS or nutrition so apologies if it's in the wrong place.
Basically, I have been suffering with presumed IBS symptoms since April. I am a 24 year old female. The course of my illness in terms of pain and discomfort has changed but over the last few months I would say has become worse and I cannot do much. I feel cramps after bowel movements (when they occur, because I struggle with constipation) that can last all day and I generally few really ill in myself - hot flashes and chills, bad nausea, bloating and soreness in my tummy generally. I wake up feeling like I have fifty rocks stuffed in my tummy even when I do manage to go to the toilet several days in a row.
My biggest worry at the moment though is my nutrition. I believe I am undernourished. I eat probably no more than about 700kcal a day (and that is on a good day) and that comes from snacky foods mostly because I have no clue what to eat as nothing in particular gives me immediate symptoms yet I still have IBS so i am wondering if something affects me later but I am struggling to know. Because I feel like this all the time, I don't think it's as cut and dry as a straight food intolerance though there may be something that bloats/constipates me.
I am just so worried because I am now at a weight of 6st13 (in June I was 8st4) and I have basically not eaten proper meals since that time (so it's no surprise I have lost weight).
I don't know what to do to get myself back into proper eating. I don't feel I can eat proper meals but I need to put some weight back on. I also want to do it gradually but is it true I will need to eat say 1500kcal a day or it won't be useful in me gaining weight? I just feel so so ill, am lacking an appetite and feel sick a lot. Do you think malnutrition could cause all these symptoms? Not IBS itself necessarily but could it cause all the chills, nausea, bloating etc? I have got myself into a total state as well as using laxatives most days over the summer to try to help with constipation. I know when I first started getting pain in April and May, I ate normally for the duration and the pain was not enough to interfere with my life - now it is. I barely leave the house.
Any help would be massively appreciated as I am totally at a desperate loss.
Thank you.

"Hello all, I am a 26 yr old male and I have a couple of questions. About a year ago, I noticed a change in my bowel habits and I also got really bloated after going on a run of eating not so healthy foods. It turns out I was constipated so I took a laxative and felt some initial relief but on and off for the last year, I've experienced the above symptoms off and on. Ive experienced both loose stools and constipation during this time. No blood or mucus have been in my stools. A lot of times it feels as if my bowels don't empty completely. 
I will admit that until this week, my diet has been poor. I drank way too much pop, ate out too much and I've never been a good fruits and veggies eater. I'm 6' and weigh about 245 but have weighed as much as 258 this past year. I also get stressed real easy and I'm a worrier so I figured I'd reach out on here. 
Do I have IBS? Am I overreacting to something that I can fix with a change in my diet? Should I worry about possible diseases worse than IBS such as colon cancer? I can say that within the last year I've taken a physical and the blood work came out normal.
Thanks All

"After two months of constant stomach pains, worse after eating, nausea, throwing up, fatique, hida scan (came back negative), ultra sound (came back negative), CT scan (came back negative), blood work (came back negative), I was told I have IBS and put on dicyclomine, 10mg four times a day. I started taking the pills last Friday, so this  is my 4th day and I am still having pains. Has anyone else bene on 10mg and how long did it take for the pains to go away? My GP won't send me to a gasterologist, I assume she thinks I am faking the symptoms, or they aren't that big of a deal. The pain, inability to eat, nausea, fatique is ruining my life. I cannot focus at work and am constantly tired.

"First off I'm a 21 year old male with anxiety and I'm quite stressed all the time worrying about my health.It started about a year ago when I went to the emergency room because my back hurt so bad I couldn't even do anything. They did a CT scan and told me I was just costipated. Everything went fine after that until about 2 weeks ago I got constipated again and went to the emergency room again. I was have really bad abdominal pain, back pain, and pain in my left side. Everytime I eat I get really bad cramps with a lot of gas and I can just feel and hear my stomach digesting. It feels like I always have to have a BM but I always have to strain and sometimes it's just really small, sometimes it's normal, and sometimes it's flat ribbon like. With this going on for weeks now it just worries me a lot. I don't have my medical insurance as of last week so I can't afford to have a colonoscopy and everything. I They ran blood tests, urine tests, and did an abnominal xray 2 weeks ago but not CT scan this time and said everything was normal. I keep stressing about it being colon cancer or something like that. I haven't had any blood in my stool so that keeps me at ease somewhat. I'm pretty sure my father has IBS and ik my grandmother has IBS-D but I never get diarrhea unless I drink prune juice. I'm only 21 so it scares me to have colon cancer or some kind of disease just because the chances are typically low. Just looking for any kind of advice or share some of the same symptoms you might have would be great because I literally can't eat a meal without having cramps and lots of gas, stomach discomfort, but no diarrhea like I said.

"Hi Everyone.
At the begining of this year i started having severe pains on the right side of my body under my ribs and also in my right shoulder with very bad upset tummy. it was so bad that i had to take 1 weeks off away from work. My doctor was sure i had gallstones as the pains were exactly where the liver is located but scans and tests all came back clear, however a stool sample picked up ""first stages of IBS"" as my doctor explained to me and prescribed Buscopan tablets. I have started getting those pains again and they are so so painful. has anyone had the same??

"Hi,
Went to the doctors about a month ago with symptoms of constipation and diarieha, nausea and gas. Got blood tests and stool sample taken and all came back normal.
The doctor thinks it's ibs and that I should remove dairy from diet and if that doesn't work try low fodmap diet which I'm going to try.
I just wondered if anyone has any other advice?
The gas and constipation I am suffering at the moment is making my life hell especially when I'm at work and is also now affecting my social life too.
It's got to the point where my colleagues at work are commenting and it's affecting their working environment as well as affecting me. The worrying it it is causing me also does not help matters either. I'm just at a loss at what to do. I've noticed in some forums that some people found relieve from taking magnesium citrate and wondering if this would help with the gas and the other symptoms I am experiencing?
Thanks

"Hello all,
Starting 4-5 months ago, I have been plagued with horrible stomach pains. One night I had a fever and went to bed, I awoke early in the morning feeling poorly, by 7 AM the pain escalated to unbearable levels. I have never felt such a pain in my life, I was unable to move and get medicine. I felt like I had a horrible case of dirreaha, yet no stool was coming out. I strained and strained, but the more I strained the worse it got. My body was shaking from the effort and I was getting hot and cold flashes.
 Eventually, I was able to call for help and go to the doctor... This horrible pain would not let up for a week. My stomach was constantly squirming and rumbling, I could not sleep, I could barely eat, and the act of sitting down was nearly impossible. I would pace around the house, only able to get some pain relief from walking.
Since that first flare up, I would have a wide range of symptoms and other flares up. I have been tested for most things and have had multiple tests run. I had an ultrasound, CAT scan, blood tests, stool tests, and colonoscopy. Only three things of relelvance have been found, I read positive for some type of imflammation, my stomach had some minor bleeding (I am taking medicine to treat it), and there was blood in my urine which could suggest Endometriosis.
My symptoms vary. My flares ups are the most debalitating. I have had 8 since the start of this, only 3 have contained dirreaha. The others felt the same way but contained no change in bowel. They are unbearable, and the act of relieving myself furthers my pain. I feel much better pinching my cheeks and pacing, than if I were to go to the bathroom. I have been taken to the ER because of the pain, yet they are unable to do anything. In my most recent flare up, I took multiple medications, all of whom were unable to stop the pain.
In the long run, when the flare ups are not an issue, I am constantly having stomach troubles. My stool is always soft, sticky, and horribly smelling. It isn't dirrreaha, but it isn't regular stool either. My lower right side of the abdomen spasms periodically, I feel it twitch and spasming especially after major episodes. I have lost over 20 pounds and have trouble eating. Not only this, but I constantly eat, I eat 5-6 meals a day and I am unable to put on any weight. I am constantly drained and dizzy when I rise to my feet. I am awoken in the night because of the pain. Ocassionally, I find blood in stool, othertimes mucus, undigested foods, and or fat.
Since the start of this, I have gone to two GI. The first, diagnosed me with FAPS and told me ""Deal with it"". The second and most recent, has diagnosed me with IBS-D.
I am not sure what to make of the diagnosis. It doesn't make logical sense to me. From the start of this, my general doctor has been treating this as if were IBS as we run the tests. So I have done the LOW FODMAP diet, which helped some but has done little to stop my flare ups. I have cut out dairy and gluten, my meals are also much more balanced. I have no stress in my life whatsoever. In fact, my flares come out of the blue. I also have tried acupuncture and relaxation techniques all of which improved my mental state but have done nothing for the pain. I am constantly taking ant-spasm medication to control my pain. I keep a food journal and I exercise multiple times a day.
I am running out of options and I am starting to become depressed. When it flares, the pain is indescribable... All over my lower abdommen... I cannot sit still.... In fact I writhe. I know my mental state has a lot to do with the matter, and I remain calm, I try to coach myself like I am a kid again. But after hours of this pain, where my body is shaking with exhaustion, it starts to look gloomy. I have tried breathing exercises, I have even tried massaging my stomach, and using steam (heat). None help. And that is what is the most frustrating. I keep getting told the pain is not real, that I need to get over it, yet no matter what I do to care for myself and fix the problem, I cannot control this unbearable pain.
Not only has it impacted my life, but it is ruining it. I try my best, don't think I'm controlled by it. But I am sick so often, I am unable to do my schooling. I can barely leave the house on most days. When I feel well, I jump on it and go out and try to catch up on my activities. I like to live in the moment, that is the only reason I have gotten through it thus far. It is just horrendous when the moment is almost always painfull. I really would like to feel somewhat better again.
Do any of you guys have any ideas of what this is? Is IBS so crippling?

"hi there. I've been having some discomfort in my upper back and stomach below my breastbone and all around my rib cage. The pain is only there sometimes, and the pain it feels like I'm winded when I take deep breaths and breathe out. I'm a bit of a worrier, and I always think it's something bad, but it is bothering me. I've been having hard stools for the passed 3 weeks and I've been having lots of gas... My lower abdomen is also tender sometimes and when I press below my breastbone it sometimes hurts as well. Also I don't know of this is linked, but when I'm writing or doing something with my right arm, I can feel a bit of tightness in my right upper back, not sure if this is a strain of a muscle, or is linked to the stomach pain in some way. 
any comments would be appreciated

"Hello everyone, this is my maiden post and I am delighted to find this forum.
I have been suffering IBS for over 20yrs and have been endlessly at the GPs surgery complaining. My symptons have included alarmingly excrucitaing pain with an urge to rush to the loo...having got there I can spend as long as 3hrs in agony, hot sweats and a plummeting blood pressure that ends up with me collapsing on the bathroom floor and passing out. When I come to I am physically sick and end up on the loo again passing mucus...I then crawl down the landing and pass out on the bed for a couple o hours much to the horror of my kids, who are only to keen to dial 999 but for me stopping them.
These episodes can last all day and the recovery period can be up to a week. I have been known to have them daily at times. I can only liken these episodes to 10cm dilated and end stages of labour.
I feel so ill and lethargic, I am careful with my diet, drinking over 4pints water a day and nothing helps, anything can trigger me especially stress.
Since researching and reading the forums it would appear I have classic symptons of Vaso Vagal Syncope on defeacation especially...basically an over sensitive vagus nerve is causing me to pass out on a regular basis with acute pain. The sweats are overwhelming and the feeling of light headedness. It is such a relief to know that I am far from alone and now I can perhaps be helped to deal with it. I am sick of having colonscopy's to find out it is IBS .....it can't be JUST IBS....and it isn't.

"Hey, i am looking for some advice. For about a year now ive been suffering from horrendous stomach pain. Ive always had some stomach aches but not to this extent. So, within the past 6 months my symptoms have started to get worse.. mouth ulcers, b12 deficient, blood in stool, mucus, bright red rash occasionally around face, neck and upper arms, bloating and obvious stomach pain. Had a flexible sigmoidoscopy yesterday, apparently the part they looked at was okay, however they took 10 biopsies. 
So my question is, is that many normal? and should i be asking for more tests (ie. colonoscopy and small bowel ct scan)
Any help would be much appreciated

"I've taken it the last 2 days and both times it made me go not long after. But it hasn't really bulked up my stools, its just kind of pushed them along, which is still kind of nice, but I'm still left with some incomplete evacuation (but less so now, thankfully) and general discomfort after every meal as per usual. My stools have been broken into lots of pieces for a long time and I was hoping the Psyllium would firm up my stools up so that I'm emptying more at a time rather than having to go like 5-6 times a day. Should I wait longer for better results or increase the amount I take now? (Started with 2 teaspoons once a day). Also when is the best time to take it? How long is Psyllium meant to take for full effect?

"Hello, i am a 25 year old male who has not really felt hungry in over two months and while I have still been eating, I have done so to keep my energy levels up and because I  do still enjoy the taste. I have also been constipated (though stool softeners help with this). I also often feel bloated, gassy and get mild pains at times all over my stomach and back. I have been to the GP twice, first time he gave me omeprazole (not sure why as I never had heartburn) and 2nd time he gave me the softeners. As I say, softeners have helped with bms but I still don't feel hungry. What do you think could be wrong with me? IBS-C? The lack of appetite is worrying for me I'm thinking I should get a colonscopy done ASAP.

"So I've been following this forum for a little and decided to post. So about 6 months ago I quit my job cause I hurt my knees. It was a valet job ran about 10 miles a day for 2 years, I'm a student so now I'm just in school full time. So after that it seemed that I had diarrhea for a little but I couldn't really remember and it was only after dinner and seemed to come from red meat. But when I ate red meat out at a restaurant it seemed fine. BUT fast foward to 2 weeks ago it become more pronounced so I went to the doctor and they said you just have a stomach bug, didn't run any tests. Other then he tapped my stomach and listened to my lungs. So that weekend I ate very little just like the BRAT diet. And it seemed to clear up for this past week I'd say I've had normal stools, it wasn't like hard but it wasn't watery or explosive, it was just pretty much normal it had shape and stuff. So now I ate some lasagna with red meat and 14 hours later when I woke up I had watery. So I got really scared, I was kind of nervous for the day idk if thats what did it. also I just broke up with my gf idk if that was the cause. But I also thought today that I've been eating sandwich for this week that Contain ham and bologna which is red meat and that hasn't had an effect on it so now Confused again. And I had spaghetti with red sauce 4 nights ago and was fine.
I'm not sure if it is something to be worried about because for 6 days I was normal and really happy, so maybe I should just stay away from heavy red meat for awhile?
I'm not really fatigued during the day, maybe a little but never need a nap. No blood in stool
Do you guys think it's ibs or stress?
My diet
Breakfast: eggs and fiber one bar
Lunch: usually a sandwich with wheat bread little mayo and chicken or ham lettuce and tomatos
Dinner: chicken, salad and veggies
Dessert: granaola bar or apple

"Hello my name is Jennifer, I am 50 years old and a stay at home mom with two children.  I have been suffering from IBS D/C for alomost 12 years.  Colonoscopies, endoscopies, sonograms, pelvic cat scans, blood tests. All normal..tried Bentyl, Levsin, Motrin 800, muscle relaxers, Advil, Vicodin, Xanaax.  You name it I tried to get relief.  After a BM I would get horrible cramps inside my stomach and deep in my pelvic area and lower back.  If those subsides, I would be in some sort of pain and or discomfort ALL DAY LONG.  Until I went to sleep woke up and started all over again.  Diarreha, constipation, gas, bloating and distention ruled my life.  My Neurologis started me on 25 mg of Pamelor, (Nortriptyline) for headache prevention.  Didn't really help much, then one day two weeks ago I was reading some other health forums about how Nortriptyline helped people with IBS.  So I said what the heck let me try to double my dose to 50.  PLEASE LISTEN WHEN I TELL YOU, I feel like a different person. No diarreha, no constipation, no distention or pain all day.  If I have a BM I might get a little crampy, but then I take the two Nortriptyline capsules and within  30 min I feel normal.  My stomach feels normal, I forgot what that was like.  It has changed my life, my mood, my outlook and energy level.  Please give it a try if you are suffering like me.  Please let me know who of you out there is suffering. I would love to hear your story and maybe I could help you too.

"Hi,
My doctor just prescribed me neomycin as a treatment for bacterial overgrowth in my gut. I have had digestive issues for about five months now and just recently got stool test results back showing I had excess fat in my stool, which my doctor said was a sign of bacterial overgrowth. 
However, I am a little concerned with his prescription of neomycin, as I have read that it may cause hearing issues as well muscle spasms. My sister also took neomycin roughly two years ago for her gut issues and has experienced ringing in her left ear ever since.

"Evening all,
I'd like to ask for your help on my symptoms which my dr suspects are IBS. Started off as lightheadedness and feeling faint as well as pains in my abdomen with either diahorea or constipation. This has been going on and off for a year, although mainly on, symptoms have hardly subsided.
I can understand the urgent need to go to the loo (really urgent at times) and the pains and diahorea but it's the constant lightheadedness that worries me as not bejng a symptom. Sometimes when I am having a ""good"" digestive day I'm still lightheaded. To be fair my good digestive day is probably not ideal still.
Please tell me someone else experiences this lightheaded faint feeling all the time?

"Hi,
I have just joined the group to try and find some help on my symptoms and what can possible be causing it.  Here are my problems:
Feeling very tired all the time
Pain underneath bottom ribs  (both sides)
Bouts of constiaption, and then very loose stools and diarrhea for several days and several times a day, sometimes with blood
mid to lower back pain and dull aches
pain dull ache upper left chest close to armpit
numbness running down arm to small finger (constant)
The pain under my ribs usually comes on suddenly and I can't pinpoint it, except that it seems to come on roughly 4-6 hours after eating???
I have been to the doctors and he examined me, pressed under right rib, and when I breathed in, pressed and felt a very, very sharp pain under left rib which was very strange as he had pressed on right side???
All bloods came back ok, but slightly high cholesterol and slightly high LFT.
GP has written to hospital to have an endoscopy, ECG and ultrasound and just awaiting to get my appointments through.
Has anyone else had these symptoms????
All I can find out is about bowel cancer, IBS, Gallstones, Spleen and pancreatic cancer.
I don't have any weight loss but stomach is always bloated and I suffer with bad acid reflux.
Any help greatly appreciated!  Thank you for your time in reading this.

"Hi!
I'm a 19 yr old female, otherwise healthy. I've been having bowel issues since the beginning of June that seem to almost disappear and then come back and I'm confused about what this could be. 
In June I had constipation for a month, thin stool, slight bloating, low appetite. I had exams though, so I chalked it up to the stress. I went to the doctors, anyways, to get it checked out: got an ultrasound, which was clear, and blood work, clear also, except a bit of anemia. Was prescribed laxatives, and the constipation, bloating, loss of appetite went away. However, the thin stool remained, and the stool colour kept changing. The stool was also always very soft, and I had more diarrhea than normal. Several times my stools almost went back to normal, but they were always on the thin side. I noticed I also got this abdominal tenderness in the top epigastric region (?) Right where my stomach and pancreas are. Some mornings the area felt kind of sore, but it was basically only tenderness to the touch. I still have that, although sometimes it almost disappears, and other times it's a lot more painful to touch than usual. Also, to mention, when I hooked my fingers under my right rib cage, my liver would often be painful to touch. However, for a month now, I haven't had this issue, so not sure if relevant. Then I noticed a lump on my right  upper quadrant, right between where the colon and liver are closest. It's hard, but  kind of movable (if I understand the term movable correctly), when I feel it. However, sometimes, I don't feel the lump at all, or I have to look hard to find it, and sometimes it seems to have shifted further away from the original spot, or it's smaller than usual. Also I can only feel this lump if I'm standing. The tenderness also seems to go away if I'm lying down. No loss of appetite.
So, I went to the campus doctor because I still had the bowel issues, and she said that it wasn't anything to worry about: she felt my abdomen  and couldn't find the lump, and to be honest, neither could I.  But I'm worried because right after I went back home, I could feel the lump again! I got bloodwork done again, which came back clear, but I'm not sure if they checked my liver function.
In addition to all of this, my mom developed bowel issues as well, which has me freaking out, because colon cancer does have a genetic factor. She has stomach upsets and diarrhea, and had this for a month now.
What is this? IBS, colon cancer?

Since finding good things to eat is so difficult, it was always tempting for me to make a lot of something so I didn't have to worry about it again for awhile. Once I stopped eating large portions, everything cleared up. a banana is a meal. A cup of yogurt is a meal. Etc.
Hope that helps someone.

"Hi guys,
Ok so to just go straight to it, i have been having this weird effect on people around me and close to me. I get very anxious and i start to sweat alot, the main problem is that my anal sphincter (both the inner and outer) feels like its open all the time and it isnt fully closed. So pretty much it seems that since it is open all the time it seems that there is a stench that is coming out it.
The most common times this happens is when i am just sitting anywhere for longer than 1 minute. As i am sitting my butt starts to accumulate sweat which makes me anxious and then starts the feeling of my anus starting to open wider and wider and this packs on to my anxiety which increases. So basically what im saying is that there is this smell that tends to make people around me react in a way or another.
The main reaction would be the scratching of the nose, then after they notice there is a stench there they start to look around for whom created this rancid smell, and lastly they start talking and making comments like ""what is that smell"", ""smells like crap, ""smells like someone didn't wipe there butt"".
This has only been happening for about a year now and it has spiraled down quite fast as beforehand i did not really notice it and this has concluded to me getting deeply depressed.
Generally i am a very hygienic person, i shower once or twice a day minimum and take good care of my body with deodorants and such as to make sure there is nothing that can make people say i smell bad. But it doesnt really help because it is something physical.
It pretty much feels like i need to go take a poop every minute of the day, even though there is nothing there. It seems like my body is naturally opening my sphincter to get ready for the bowel movement. It is very uncomfortable and honestly feels like my anal area is opening it twitching involuntarily. It maybe nerve damage but I don't know.
Please help

"So it all started in December 2015 with diarrhea,stomach pain burning feeling under the left ribb and nausa feeling like that if I wanted to faint. After 3 months the docotor found I had HP and I got tripple treatment for 1 week clarithromycin, amoxicillin and PPL.
After that I was not better so had to do a gastroscopy in June and they saw  that I had a mild chronic gastritis (no ucler) and I still HP left. So they putted me on metronidazole, amoxicillin and PPL for 14 days.
1 month after I did a stool test came back negative. 4 months after that, I still feel bad  after I eat sometimes i feel nasues and like i want to vomit, and it can burn / hurt on the left side under the ribb.
My question is how long can it take for a mild gastritis to heal after HP? and is there anyone else out there who had a mild gastritis from HP that can shear there story how long it took for them to get better.
My docs say there is not much i can do and dont give me a straight answer how i can heal in the best way... 
I try to stay on a strict diet but still dont seem to help alot.

"Hi, I was diagnosed with IBS at the end of last year. I suffer with a severe cramps in my stomach and was prescribed antispasmodics. Since I've started taking them the cramps have reduced. I have also had a problem with bloating, usually in the evening and I understand this is pretty common.
However, I have had a very bloated stomach for 9 days now and I'm getting worried. My IBS is thought to be stress/anxiety linked as I could not find any food links. I have been referred for counselling and am waiting for the appointment to come through.
I exercise, swimming and running, about 5 times per week, I eat healthily, I don't drink fizzy drinks, fruit juice or caffeine. I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
My stomach is making me utterly miserable. I can't wear any of my normal clothes as they are all too tight at the waist. I also feel really uncomfortable and constantly worry about needing the toilet. I don't know if 9 days is normal for bloating or if I should go back to the gp.? I don't want to waste both our time.
Has anyone else had bloating lasting this long and is there anything I can do to help reduce it? I have a reflexologist appointment for next week. I'm willing to try anything..
Thanks for reading.

"Hello, so I am new to this.
I have been struggling with lower abdominal pains for years but no one believed me as the pains could last 2 seconds but some could last an hour.
July this year I finally went to the doctors as the pains were so unbearable I was screaming constantly, I had to leave my job because of it and no one knew what was wrong.
The doctors finally did blood tests, they did them 3 different times and each time it one of the bloods came back high (I'm unsure what one).
I finally have an appointment on Tuesday the 18th of October for a colonoscopy, I spoke to a doctor this week and she said that it will most likely be like a 'pre op' were the surgeon will give me information and what not and then I will have to go back. I could essentially be waiting for who knows how long and I can't do it. The doctors won't give me painkillers as they will just constipate me they said.
I was just wondering if anyone had any tips on what to do and how to cope with all this, it is so stressful and I'm not exactly coping with it well at all.

"Soy lecithin can cause significant IBS.
 It is an extremely common food additive in packaged foods.  It is an emulsifier - (like a ""detergent"" that breaks down fats and oil on dishware) that allows food ingredients to mix well by making the oils mix better together with other ingredients in packaged foods.  
But it also irritates the colon because it also breaks down the colon mucus lining (like a detergent), causing:
inflammation of the colon
diarrhea
blood in stool
related complications.
I'm emailing this note in kindness to you because I came across an online article entitled: ""Conquering IBS"" that says soy lecithin is okay to eat.  It is not okay.
I have personal experience with this issue as well.  I was diagnosed by my gastroenterologist after having IBS symptoms after 5 long years of issues after turning 40 years old.
After 3 subsequent years of exhaustive elimination diets, I found that soy lecithin was the culprit.
I stopped eating it (tough to do because it is so common in packaged foods) and have been completely IBS symptom free for 6 years.  
Then my 14 year old son started having the same IBS symptoms.  He stopped eating soy lecithin (again hard to do because so common - breads, cookies, chocolate, etc), and his symptoms stopped completely.  Started again, symptoms came back. Stopped - gone.  You get the picture.
The soy industry probably does NOT want this information be known about this soybean by product, but it is very true.
Help spread the word.
Regards,
SC

It never caused much trouble until 2010, I'd severe cramp pain on right side and constant achy pain at coccyx.the pain was so severe I would cry, I passed out from it one day.

Pregnant 2012, 3 months in severe pain kicked in again, it made me contract up to 30 times a a day, pain woke me every night was put off work early in case baby came early, I was told baby was pressing on bowel and causing pain.after baby 2013, no bad trouble. Every few months I'd be constipated for 3 days with severe pain in back and right side, motion on third day, pain would leave. Sometimes unable to work due to psin. July 8th this year, no bowel movement... I've been in pain dice, pain on right side and at coccyx. Doc suggested colpermin, fodmap and fybogel, codipar for pain. Fodmap has eased bloating, colpermin was no use so stopped it. Tried alflorax, it helped with bloating. Introduced magnesium and pain at coccyx has gone, constant twinge and discomfort at right side.

"For the last five years, I have had a recurring problem that comes on the same way every time and hits me like a truck. I will spontaneously start having diarrhea constantly (every hour) and nausea, along with chills and generally feeling terrible. It feels like a stomach virus. Going to the hospital for an I.V. helps. Eventually, by taking a medicine called debridat, I get back to normal.
The first time it happened, the chills and nausea and frequent bathroom trips went away quickly, but I had diarrhea a few times a day for about 6 months after before finally, gradually getting back to normal. Every time since, the diarrhea has gotten better in the first few days, along with the other symptoms.
This has happened about once a year since, and every time seems to be when my immune system is really low (haven't been sleeping, international flights, sunburned, etc.)
Last year, I had a colonoscopy which showed a little ulceration in the part of the small intestine that indicates Crohn's. The doctor said it's either Crohn's or possibly the result of taking NSAIDs. I have taken a ton of NSAIDs in my life, but not too often leading up to the colonoscopy.
For the other 360 days a year, I eat whatever I want, unaffected. Then, boom!
Does anyone have any input on whether this is Crohn's or just IBS? Any advice?

"I've been suffering some weeks now.
Bit of background, I do suffer from acid and currently on Lansoprazole. I had a gastroscopy which found and ulcer, so lansoprazole was doubled. I then went back for a gastroscopy and it was noted things were much better. However past few months I have had terrible back pain.. lower back. Two visits to the Dr Who stated it was muscle pain. However a bloated abdominal cramping is apparent too. I thought the problem was bread so I completely cut it from my diet and I found symptoms improved greatly. But at times almost always at night every night I just get terrible lower back pain and abdominal cramping where I just feel bloated and feel as though I need to keep passing wind. Can anyone relate?

"I had my first colonoscopy yesterday and felt fine. They couldn't complete it because by bowel is too loopy apparently!
I had sedation (which did nothing) and was home pretty quick. I wasn't hungry but had a sandwich that evening as I'd been 48hrs without food so thought I better get something in me. Felt very full after but ok. Bit crampy but nothing major.
This morning again I was not hungry but had porridge. As soon as a started eating I felt very nauseous and had stomach cramps in both stomach and intestines. I finished eating thinking it might be hunger - nausea but felt worse after and continued to feel really sick all morning.
by lunchtime I felt ok ( but again not hungry) so I had toast and soup. As soon as I had half a slice of toast I felt really nauseous again but ate most of the lunch. Ever since I've had stomach pain and now I've had diarrhoea too. Mt stomach is really sore and crampy (the intestine pain has gone now I've been to the toilet), I still feel nauseous and I feel kind of rough in general. I didn't feel this bad taking the prep!
Has anyone else felt ill after their colonoscopy? Any tips or advice?

"Hey everyone,
I have been a healthy person and have had nothing serious wrong with me, no surgery,no diseases,etc. When summer ended though this year I noticed I haven't used the bathroom in over two weeks and I was suffering nausea and stomach cramps etc. So I took constipation medicine and it cleared me out in about 4 hrs. Well ever since that happened I noticed I was still getting constipated so I started taking mineral oil which will make you go ever 1-2days but if I don't take it I can't go. Also I've noticed that I get really anxious when I go somewhere to eat and I get to feeling so bad I have to skip eating with the family and go back home and lay down for about 10-20mins and it will pass and feels like nothing ever happened. I went to Doctor did some blood work everything came back ok. I also wake up in morning feeling very dehydrated and I've started drinking about 8 glasses of water or more a day and that hasn't changed a thing and no I pee regularly which means not to often but about 2 maybe 4 times a day. I think it could be ibs but I need help figuring it out I'm only 16. Symptoms nausea when about to eat in public, stomach cramping feeling light headed a lot, can't excerise without feeling of passing out, constipation if I don't take mineral oil (natural constipation medicine), no my appendix side doesn't hurt,get anxious over things that I never get anxious about or before. I do have a fear of passing out so that may be the cause something. If any of you read this and have similar problems or know what might be causing this please let me know! I'm ready to get back to feeling normal again!

"Hello, ever since mid July after I got back from visiting family in Germany I have had bouts of Nausea that last anywhere from a few days to a week. Then I have a week or two without it and then it comes back. The nausea is very minor, it doesn't cause trouble in my daily life, its just there. On occassion my stomach does feel acidy and i'll have random pains around my stomach, very very minor pains might I add.

"Hello,
I've recently had issues with eating beef, however it only seems to be steaks. I can eat things such as burgers without issue.
Beef steaks cause constipation but not to the point where I cannot go at all, just less frequently. On top of this bowl movements are painful and often make me feel ill.
I'm going to stop eating steaks as that's probably the only solution but I was hoping you guys could explain why only steaks and not burgers?

"Hi all, 
I'm new to all this, as I've only been having gut issues for about 4 months now. I'll briefly try to detail my experiences below:
-at the beginning of June, there was about a week and a half where I couldn't fart. This was the beginning of all my digestive issues. I felt extremely bloated, tight, and just like I had trapped gas that wouldn't come out.
-after x-raying me and finding nothing wrong with me, my doctor told me I was constipated, thus I should eat more stone fruits/fiber. I did as I was told, but didn't feel better.
-at this point, I decided to omit all grains, dairy, and soy from my diet (essentially following a paleo lifestyle). I did this for about a month, but still experienced extreme bloating (to the point of visible distention), cramping, and trouble pooping--I now had lost my urge to poop and would have to force myself to defecate. Additionally, my bms were often very small, but still soft. I was also tested for celiac disease. I do not have  it.
-since after a month, I still wasn't feeling better, my doctor told me to clean out my colon by doing a Miralax cleanse--for 2 days, I drank nothing but water, pear juice, and chicken broth and had 6 capfuls of Miralax a day. I was pooping a lot. 
-after the clean-out, I reverted back to my original state of discomfort. Could not poop without forcing, was severely bloated. I now experienced abdominal pain from time-to-time as well.
-went to a gastroenterologist. He told me I had IBS and to assume the low-Fodmap diet for two weeks.
-I did not feel better with the low-Fodmap diet. I was in a constant state of discomfort due to bloating (again, to the point of visible distention), cramping (sometimes it felt like I was on my period), and in inability to produce successful bms (ones that wouldn't just be a small pile of mush after straining for 20 mins).
-my GI specialist prescribed me Rifaximin and probiotics (50 million strain) for two weeks. Each day, I take 3 Rifaximin doses (1 pill at 6am, 2pm, and 10pm) and 2 probiotic doses (1 probiotic at 10am and 6pm). I have been on this treatment for 10 days now and do not feel better. My symptoms include:
     -severe bloating and trapped gas, regardless of the time of day or
      whether I just ate or not (abdomen always protruding now; visible
      distention)
     -pain/cramping, especially in the lower left quadrant of my abdomen
     -loss of my urge to poop (just feels like I have to fart, which can be
      confusing). I now poop out of obligation--I have felt that when I don't
      force it, the feces just accumulates and I feel worse.
     -bms are soft and small (piles of mush), yet require a great deal of
      time and effort spent straining (as well as squatting on top of my toilet       seat)
     -the feeling that someone has poured cement in my intestines and let
      it harden (feeling sludgy, heavy, taut--like my guts are being
      compressed)
I have tried taking magnesium citrate each night to help me poop. The recommended serving size is 2 tsp, which worked like a charm the first time I took it. After the first time, however, it did not work. I would take it at 10pm and not have a bm until the next day at around 2-3pm (and it would be forced). I have upped my dosage to 3 1/2 tsp, but I still have to force in order to poop at all the next day (unless I wanted to risk feeling severely backed up for the rest of the day). 
I should also provide background as to what kind of lifestyle I have:
     -I am healthy. I eat several servings of fruits and vegetables a day. I
      drink plenty of water. I limit the amount of gluten and grains I have to
      1 or less servings per day.
     -I am active. I do cardo-intense kickboxing three times a week, and
      spar once a week. Occasionally, I go on walks.
     -I am a woman. I am 5'10 and weigh 140-145 lbs.
I think that should cover it for now. What do you think this could be? What is my next step/what would you recommend? Is anyone out that who had the same experience as me that could offer me any advice? I don't want to deal with this for the rest of my life, as it has begun to affect not just my physical well-being, but my mental state of mind as well.
Thanks. Any help/input is greatly appreciated.

"Hi all,
Coming to the forums after reading many threads on here via Google, need some input into my current situation...
I've been ill one way or another for the best part of 7 months now, which seemed to start around the time I was suffering from high levels of stress at work.
Started the year needing a root canal, which was a rather unpleasant experience and took weeks to settle down (more on that later). Was given a 7-day course of antibiotics in case of any residual infection. Before the root canal was done my neck tightened up so much my shoulder was pretty much up by my chin such was the discomfort.
Following that around March I caught some sort of bug which caused fatigue, nausea etc. and took the best part of 3 weeks to go. During that time suffered from indigestion, getting up in the middle of the night to pee as well as shaking and pins & needles in muscles when walking.
After lots of physio and personal trainer I managed to get muscles back to some sort of normality and did some light exercise, although any physical activity did come with much longer recovery times in terms of muscle soreness etc.
A few weeks later I felt my neck start tightening up again then the sensations went into my jaw, chin and cheek. Upset stomach returned along with shortness of breath, muscle spasms and dizzy spells. Went to the GP to get a blue inhaler and also some antibiotics as the doctor agreed that it was likely a sinus infection.
Unfortunately said GP didn't read my notes and gave me antibiotics (Amoxicillin) that I was listed as being allergic to (I've never been told which paticular ones so didn't know what I was being given). Within a few hours I had a bad reaction to them, woke up in the middle of the night doubled up in pain with stomach cramps and severe pain in the middle-right section of abdomen.
Called 111 and went to A&E where reaction was confirmed, only treatement was to use water to flush the antibiotics out and Gaviscon to settle stomach.
Carried on feeling unwell for a week or so, using the little bit of sport I could do as distraction from the dizziness, twitching and upset stomach. Went back to see another GP who attributed some symptoms to severe hayfever (levels are very high right now) and advised antihistamines.
At this point neck glands were also sore but not visibly swollen. Fatigue continued, along with inflamed feeling all over body. Continude to notice pain in my right side, made worse when bending down. 
Carried on for a few more days until again being woken in the night by pains in the right side. Went to GP who noticed my temperature was up so sent me to A&E with suspected appendicitis. Had blood tests, UTI test etc. and a doctor at hospital pressing various parts of abdomen who then came up with a diagnosis of ""non specific abdominal pain"". Said nothing serious and take painkillers.
The day after I came down with the symptoms of flu, which then really came over the course of 2 weeks. Massive amounts of yellow mucus from the left side of my head along with sore throat, stomach upset and all the other nasty fatigue effects of the flu virus. Never had anything like this as the flu jab usually keeps it at bay but I'm guessing my immune system was shot from the previous bug and antibiotic reaction.
Bowel movements were a bit constipated so initially was given Mebeverine, which helped restore some normal function and I hoped that would be the end of it.
However once the flu finally went it left me with bubbling, twitching sensations in my stomach, right side and into legs. I also noticed that when sitting down e.g. at a table to eat I could feel a strong pulsing sensation coming from the stomach area. Got quite scared by this (aneurysm) so went back to the GP to get it checked out.
Had another examination pressing on stomach etc. and the diagnosis was ""IBS"" due to stress. Was given Omeprazole 40mg and told to come back in 2 weeks. Those pills seem to have made me 10x worse as when I take them I get acid reflux (never had that before), raised anxiety, dizziness and recently migraines. Also since going on the pills now suffering with extreme muscle fatigue after pretty much any physical exertion and even vision problems (blurred vision, floaters etc.) 
Want to get off this medication asap as reading threads on here the side effects do seem to outweigh the perceived benefits. Also seems they're mostly prescribed for GERD rather than IBS? Qutie ironic given they've caused reflux in my case.
Based on various threads I'm trying some more natural options like Slippery Elm before meals (seems to help), having probiotics such as Kefir and also tried the low FODMAP diet on GP advice.
What's worrying me is the fact the right sided pain is still there, along with the feeling that something is pressing on my insides if I bend over or sit up in bed etc. The tightness in the right side almost seems to go into my back and leg as well.
I'm getting scared by some of the links I'm reading about misdiagnosed IBS and some of the serious illnesses it can most (big C included) then see this one just after signing up, terrifying...
https://patient.info/forums/discuss/irritable-bowel-syndrome-not--521868
I'm going to ask for a referral to go private when I next see the GP this week as I feel the NHS are happy to go with this almost guesstimate diagnosis of IBS without running any tests to prove otherwise or try to treat the root cause.
What I'm not sure of is if all this is a complication of the various illnesses I've had over the past few months or if it goes back further. Thinking back I can remember having a strain feeling in the right hand side for over a year now but blamed it on a sports-related muscle strain as I was very physically active prior to all this happening.

"I've been suffering with severe lower abdominal pain  and constipationfor years but its been much worse over the past few months.    Ater numerous tests my GI ordered a lactulose breath test which was positive for methane. I'vw had two rounds of xifaxan both of which helped for a short time.  Then I followed the low Fodmap diet for 12 weeks During that time the pain and constipation returned.  My GI has now prescribed Xifaxan and neomycin.  I wondering if anyone here has used that combination.  If so were there side effects?  Did it help?  What was your dosage and for how long.  I am concerned about side effects because I have difficuty tolerating meds.  My GI said they are not absorbed and stay in the intestines so are usually well tolerated.  Thanks for listening.

"Hello.
Well on Wednesday might went to gym whilsy already tired and over did it. Went home drunk protein and slept.
Felt so thirsty and tired and cold all of Thursday. Thought it was exhaustion or dehydration.
Friday felt better, so thought I had past it all. Friday evening delt fine.
Saturday morning passed a mixed poo, then started having yellow mucus run by itself out of my anus. I felt dehydrated again so drunk water, more water I drunk more mucus passes. Also have cough.
Sunday passes similar, but in evening night no mucus passes, hope it is improving. All saturday and sunday no more poo passes.
Monday I feel good, but a bit pressure for no poo, so go to poo, a fair bit comes out in one go, but hard to tell as in smaller pieces upon releasing. A little pale brown. Now continuing yellow mucus again and occasional small pieces of pale poo, similar mince I guess.
One of the problems is the yellow mucus discharge I can't control, it just comes out and seems to increase with water intake.
Sorry its disgusting to describe. But its started so suddenly and in an odd manor, I feel it can't be serious, can it?
Any advice or experience of these strange symptoms? Is it possible a gallstone?

"Hey everyone,
I've had gut issues for about 4 months now. My gastroenterologist diagnosed it as IBS. 
I have a sister who suffers from IBS as well, among numerous other problems like SIBO and conditions we (doctos included) have not been able to figure out yet. She started having gut problems roughly 4 years ago.
We both started having gut issues at around the same age (just five years apart), which is around age 17-18 (I started having mine about half a year earlier though). 
Why do we both have digestive issues? Why is it that our timing is so similar? Is it because of hormones? Is there a gene that certain people have that makes them prone to more bowel disorders? I have tried  looking this up online in addition to discussing it with my doctor, but there seems to be a lot of vague, conflicting evidence. 
Anyone have any ideas?

"Here is my story: I am 18 years old and I have phobia of cancer...
About 2 years ago, I have had some change in my bowel movement and saw blood in my stool I was terrified because it was pretty similar to symptoms of cancer, I went to the doctor and told him about my concerns he told me it should be nothing serious but I insisted to do some screening so he ordered an abdominal ultrasound which showed nothing serious apart a small hemengioma on the liver which is nothing dangerous I guess... So the doctor told me I have IBS, but  the thing is the moment ""I believed it was not cancer"" (Because abdominal ultrasound does not detect colon or stomach cancer but I did not know that at the time) anyway I felt better and symptoms vanished and years went on...
Until a couple month ago I was doing some crunches and then after I was done I was really bloated and the next day when I went to the toilet there was too much blood. Also I started having change in my bowel movment alternating between constipation and diarrhea it did not get better after a week so I went to another doctor he also did not take it for something too serious maybe because of my young age but I also insisted we need to do something so we did a colonscopy to check for the blood cause, the colonscopy showed nothing all was clear...
So I said to myself I should start getting better now but in fact it's not. Here are my current symptoms right now :
-Alternating between constipation and diarrhea, in a sense that when I eat stuff like chicken meats fatty food I have hard stools and when I eat fibers vegetables I have very loose stool not but not 100% liquid.There is no middle ground 
-Also when I eat or even drink water my abdomen is distiented for a while, especially water everytime I drink I feel throat burp and sometimes the water comes up.
- Everytime I wake up even if I did not eat anything at night, I need to pass gass I feel like I am filled with air...(My gas are becoming only air and I did not have smely gas for a while that's also strange)
-There is blood often (Which is not IBS) so  the doctor told me it could be because of hemerroid or anal fissure but recently I am only seeing blood when I have loose stool.. Strange I am really worried about that
No one is taking me seriously and I am afraid I might have a problem in my stomach or small intestine/colon. Does anyone have same symtoms as me ?... Please help me I don't know what to do, I want to feel better!

"Is it possible to have different reactions to different foods (or whatever) that causes IBS to feel different?
I've always had IBS and I didn't need to be diagnosed at first. I knew with certain foods (mainly greasy like McDonalds) that I would get some bad cramps in my lower central abdomen for 1-2 minutes, have very bad watery diarrhea and then would be perfectly normal again. Nothing I couldn't handle and it happened maybe once a month.
Lately I've been having a burning sensation on my right side, all the way from my upper right quandrant (they thought GB at first) through my right flank and sometimes even down into my right groin. I've had diarrhea every day (not watery, but looser stools) 1 to 2 times a day - actually feels like it comes out solid but when I look in the toilet it's broken apart. No sense of urgency and 95% of the time it feels like I've completely evacuated when finished. The pain is gone in the mornings and seems to progress throughout the day, sometimes getting better. I don't notice a difference in the burning after a bowel movement.
2 years ago I had an upper GI (barium swallow) with small bowel follow through, an ultrasound and a HIDA scan. By the time the tests were done, the pain had gone away and I felt perfectly fine again (HIDA scan DID some back ""abnormal"" with a ejection fraction of 98%). They weren't sure if that was the problem however, due to the ""pain"" not being concentrated in the URQ. About a month ago it started up again, but no where near as bad as 2 years ago. So far, I've had the routine bloodwork, a stool sample and an ultrasound. All is clear at this point (no inflammation, no blood, pancreas/liver/kidneys fine, no gallstones or wall thickening). So I feel like my GI is going to learn towards IBS.
But this IBS is different then what I would call my ""typical"" IBS. Is is possible to react differently to different things?

"I'm a woman in my mid-20s, quite new to this IBS world, having only been diagnosed a couple of months ago (although I've had symptoms for many years which have worsened in the last 6 months).
I have a pattern of getting several days of extremely bad constipation followed by several days of diarrhoea. When my diarrhoea first comes on I will be stuck on the loo for hours because it's coming every 10 minutes or so. It tends to then wear off a bit but I'll still be going every hour or so.  
The biggest practical problem is, really embarrassingly, I'm increasingly finding that I don't get to the toilet in time. The urge and cramps come on really suddenly and I can't hold it. I usually get a sudden wave of really bad cramp which often has me doubled up in pain, and then it's like my bowels just contract of their own accord. It's also the really explosive, watery type of diarrhoea, so unless there's a bathroom really nearby it's a disaster. Today I've had 4 ""accidents"". Buscopan or Imodium doesn't seem to do much at all. I'm feeling quite sick and the cramps are incredibly painful, but this feels like the worst thing at the moment. It's just so debilitating and I'm scared of going anywhere in case I have an ""accident"".
Does anyone have experience / advice?

"Hey.
I am 19 years old and have had IBS for around 5 years. Orignally my symptoms were mainly nausea and constipation - more so the nausea. I felt sick constantly and was completely reliant on anti-nausea meds. As I grew older, the nausea settled and I was able to come off the meds. However, I found that the constipation got much worse to the point that I was only going to the loo once a week. I have tried fibrogel for this but that did not seem to make much of a difference. 
In the last year, it appears that my IBS has really stepped up a whole new level. I have been for several blood tests and also an ultrasound on my entire stomach area which all came back clear. I have no recognisable allergies nor health issues and thus the increase in symptoms is somewhat of a mystery. The only thing that was discovered was that I have excess gas in my stomach which obviously contributes to the symptoms. 
At the moment my symptoms are:
nausea
constipation
bloating
loss of appetite
headaches
trapped wind
It is really beginning to get me down and affect not only my physical but my mental health also - some days I do not want to get out of bed and quick frankly, I would rather die than have to live with this my entire life.
I just wanted to know if anyone who has similar symptoms has any tips or tricks for what helps them. At the moment the only trick I have is sucking on mints but that doesnt always work.
Please let me know.
Thank you

"I was having some stomach pains and was referred to GI consultant. Endoscopy came back clear, ultrasound was clear and am now waiting for colonoscopy. Wouldn't say I've had an major changes in bowel habits although have been on iron tablets since April so that has had some impact I think. My problem is vomiting. Since July I have been having regular vomiting episodes. I often know when it is going to start because I will often feel a bit constipated on the day prior to being sick. The vomiting usually occurs at night along with painful stomach cramps and gurgling in my lower abdomen. This can last anything from 12 to 36 hours. Once the vomiting has stopped I am often left with stomach pains in the upper abdomen that come and go. After a day or so I may have one episode of diarrhoea and then the pains go too. Does anyone experience anything similar? It doesn't sound like IBS to me, not when I compare my symptoms to those in here. Thanks.

"Hi my name is Tommy and I'm 16 years old,
So currently I have worked out a bit of a system to cope with my IBS. Generally when I go for a poo I can take anywhere from 1-4 hours to fully go. So whenever I need to be ready for something I wake up 4 hours before to ensure I'm ready on time. 
Normally I feel the urge to go from around 4-7am. Normally during weekends and school holidays I would get up at around 10-11am and go then and that would be fine for the rest of the day and I wouldn't need to go the next. Sometimes I would be going out earlier so I would get up at 6am and go then and that would be fine for the rest of the day.
Last year during school I wouldn't go when I got up at 6am and felt the urge to go I would wait until I got home from school at around 4pm and go then. Problem with that was that I was in pain all day. This school year my timetable is more flexible so I can get up later on some days and go before school. For example last Friday I went at 4am and today I went at 6am. Normally during school holidays if I went at this time I would not need to go for the rest of the day however Friday and today when I got home from school I need to go again although I'd already been.
Why is this? It's really annoying as it is taking up a lot of my time so please help me. 
Thanks

"This is gonna be a long story. It started out in 2015 when I got a bad case of the stomach virus. I puked about 30 times. I lost so much weight. I was about 67 pounds at 15 years old, and I was 4'11. After a few weeks, I was completely better but then I noticed I was nauseous one day and headed to gag in the toilet. Turns out I didn't have to, I was just so anxious it would happen again. So I was naseous every day for about 8 months. My doctor thinks I had gastritis. Then I slowly got over it because I took colostrum and it helped my intestines. I gained weight that winter and got up to about 87 pounds. Which I was happy with. My anxiety was so bad though because I didn't want to get it again so I never went out and just cried in bed. Then in March of 2016, I had the stomach virus again. Not as intense maybe I puked 15 times instead of thirty. But after that night, my anxiety got even worse. I was 80 pounds again, 16 years old, and 5'0. My doctor put me on Sertraline to help me with anxiety and I started getting therapy. But during that time, at night, I would have bad bowel movements. I had green bowls for about a week after a panic attack. Now, I have frequent bowel movements every night if I eat fruit, gluten, or dairy (im lactose intolerent). My doctor suggested I get a colonoscopy and endoscopy but I didn't feel the need to get one. I was just too anxious and I for sure knew I had some type of bowel problems. Maybe IBS, or colotis? My mom researches all the time and I do too. I am weighing in at about 76 pounds, 5'1, and I'm almost 17. All my blood tests, stool tests, ultrasounds, and xrays came back normal over the course of 2 years. I think once though my doctor saw mucus in my stool though but he said it was normal. Someone help. I still have no clue.

"Shortly after every meal I will experience discomfort in my lower colon and rectum that is very difficult to ignore. I DON'T experience any pain, I just feel overly sensitive to the sensation of stool or gas sitting in there and will also feel bloated and tight and have the slight urge I need to go. After passing stool I will get some relief, although my stools come out broken up and flat leaving me with incomplete evacuation. I also experience a lot of flatulance and often the gas will get stuck in my rectum for a little while before it finally passes. I can sort of feel the little bubbles of gas pushing against the inside of my rectum which is relieved after I pass wind. Also when I pass stool it irritates my rectum as it comes out and I can be sitting on the toilet for 30 mins before I finally feel done. It never comes out in one smooth motion, always bits at a time. I've tried a lot of different things to remedy the problem with no real results and had tests done including a colonoscopy that didn't really show anything. I'm hoping someone here will be able to recommend something that has worked for them, that maybe I haven't tried yet. Any suggestions?

"Hi... this is my first post; I don't really have much of a story. I have been prone to dyspepsia at odd times through my life from childhood; years ago I was prescribed Lansoprazole for functional (non-ulcer) dyspepsia but stopped taking it as it didn't work. This drug was eventually replaced by Ranitidine which I tended to take on an 'as and when I need it' basis. I still do.
Back in February my partner and I were both struck down with the Winter Vomiting Bug, or Norovirus; it was an unpleasant but mercifully short experience which lasted for perhaps 24hrs. Since that time my GI tract seem to have been completely re-wired and it's getting worse. A couple of months ago my GP put me on a beta blocker, Propanolol (for occasional BP spikes), but this had some unpleasant side effects. It was changed to Bisoprolol but I struggled with that too; breathing difficulties, lightheadedness and stomach upset. GP says I probably have IBS!
My experience is that I don't have a bowel movement for a few days (other than the occasional 'rabbit dropping') and then my entire system empties out in one day which is grim to say the least. The trips to the loo become more frequent through that day but do not generally end in watery diarrhoea as such. The result of this activity is feeling like a mule kicked my gut and then the nausea starts and can last a day or two. This puts me off eating as I don't know quite what it is best to eat and I haven't found any obvious connection with what I put in my mouth and what happens elsewhere :-)
Other than my age, I have no 'red flag' signs; a few months ago I had a clear bowel screen (NHS sends these out routinely to people over 50 now I think). I have seen the occasion dribble of brown mucus (gross... sorry!) but certainly no blood. So... I am waiting blood test results and am to have an ultrasound of abdomen soon which the GP described as 'probably over the top' but he was very reassuring and quite sure of his diagnosis. I am hoping he is right as I had breast cancer five years ago and so anything 'odd' is viewed with fear and trembling :-) I'm going to investigate hypnotherapy next week, in case anxiety is contributing. I am generally a positive person so am determined to try and manage this as best as I can.
My question (!) is... if I do have IBS... would I be described as someone with IBS-C, IBS-D or mixed? The predominant features are nausea, wind (either end), constipation, diminished appetite and the occasional day of nuclear fallout. In the past three months I have lost a few pounds but I eat much less than I used to and also do more exercise (I retired from a sedentary job and now have taken on an allotment so am much fitter).
Sorry if I have burbled on but that, as far as it goes, is my story. If someone could put me in the right IBS 'box' I would be grateful as I am currently not sure how to manage diet, or anything else come to that. Thanks :-)

"Hello, 
I'm a 3rd year child branch student nurse, aged 20. I've got IBS (Self diagnosed... Have been to a doctor, but not my GP, who wasn't overly helpful), so was reading NICE Guidance yesterday, and it suggested trying a Probiotic yoghurt. I tried for a week before and I think I was put off by the taste.
The guidance says to try for four weeks, so I'm going to give it another go. Can anyone recommend one that doesn't taste too bad, and has worked for them? Appreciate that what works for one, might not for me though, and that ultimately I might just have to stomach the taste to reduce my symptoms but any advice would be helpful.

I had blood work done which was all normal but my health anxiety levels are the worst they have ever been in my life. The last 3 days I have been basically catatonic just lying in bed 100% convinced that I have Crohn's disease.
My doctor thinks it's possibly IBS but I've asked for a special stool test for inflammation.
Does my story sound like any of yours?

"Hi, I was recently diagnosed with IBS, and the doctor told me to try the low FODMAP diet for 6-8 weeks to see if it helps. She gave me a leaflet, which only gives a few examples of the types of foods to avoid, and having looked for more information on the Internet I'm confused as to whether I should be avoiding wheat or not. Leaflet doesn't mention it but other sources of information do. Can anyone help?

"Hi all. I am hoping that some of you guys can offer some advise and share some of your symptoms with me. I have been having various pains in my abdomens everyday since early May. They started on upper right abdomen that lasted for a month. I thought it was gallbladder but ultrasound shown that it was fine. Early June, the pains moved to middle epigastric area and left side. Was sent for a ct of abdomen with contrast. That showed that everything was normal. Had eus to check bile ducts. That too was normal. Tons of blood tests and faecal calprotectin test. All normal. My gastro doctor said that it is a functional bowel problem. In fact, I have 2 gastro docs tell me this. At the moment my symptoms are a bloated feeling and little pain in upper left abdomen that feels sometimes like a balloon is being blown up and squeezed. This feeling stays like this all day. Never really moves apart from feeling like it's being squeezed more. From what I've read, this should be releaved when I go the toilet but it isn't really helping. I do feel like I need to go all the time. Lots of wind also. Does this sound like ibs? Do any of you experience similar symptoms?
Sorry for the length of the post.

"For the last few months I've been showing symptoms of IBS such as constipation, feeling bloated, stomach cramps, and so on, and all of these things seem to be strongly linked to stress levels. But now, even though my stress is pretty much gone, I still get very foul wind, and this makes being around people excrutiatingly embarrassing and depressing (it also stresses me out more, so you can see how the cycle continues).
I've seen the GP several times, and they can't recommend anything to help besides ""being less stressed"", but this doesn't seem to eradicate the problem either.
I've tried charcoal pills, omitting certain foods from my diet, taking fybogel to increase my fibre levels...absolutely nothing has worked and I'm desperate for some means of suppressing this symptom because I can't go back to school like this.
If anyone has had any luck with a certain brand of probiotics, or a lifestyle change, etc, please let me know so I can kick this before it gets any worse.

"For the past few weeks I've been having what I would call a burning sensation on my right flank. It can go from the front upper to the back lower but mainly stays on the lower side lately. Sometimes it feels like it's right on the skin, sometimes it feels like it's in my fat (I'm obese - mainly sparetire around waist), sometimes it feels deeper. I had a physical a little over a week ago and told my doctor about my adbominal pain and he sent me home and said to call him if it got worse.
Well today it got worse after a few days of feeling almost 100%.. The burning got pretty bad and I paniced and called my doctor again. I had myself convinced I was going to the E.R. for appendicitis. He thankfully got me in pretty quick and took a urinalysis - everything was fine there. No fever. He pressed around on my stomach and nothing hurt bad. He asked me to call my GI again and set up an appointment with him so that's where I'm at right now. My GI's office closed at noon today so I have to wait until tomorrow to call back. Funny enough, I'm debating whether to or not as I feel halfway decent as I'm writing this.
When I sit and bend over it almost feels like something is swollen or there is something there that shouldn't be. I've had a spout of indigestion/bloating a few days back and diarrhea off and on (just loose, not watery). I also think I have a bit of heartburn, but it's more like an irritation in my throat, not super painful at all. I think it's better when I'm standing/walking around and I feel like hot showers temporarily relieve the pain.
I feel like I'm going to get an IBS diagnosis as this happened a few years ago for a couple of months. My GP had me do a barium swallow with small bowel follow through - clear. The GI first suspected gallbladder and did an ultrasound and HIDA scan - all clear. By the end of the tests all the pain was gone all while staying on the same diet. I've still since had slight heartburn and random stomach pain/diarrhea every once in a great while.
Just looking to see if anyone has had similar symptoms - lower right flank burning sensation. Turns on for a few months and then goes away for a few years?

"Was diagnosed with IBS after a normal colonoscopy in November 2014. No diverticulosis seen or polyps,etc during scope. Yet two ct scan (this year) saw diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. One ct in april without contrast and one in july with both saw it. I ended up in emergency care due to terrible bout of D in July that lasted half the day with each movement becoming more forceful than the one before. I would guess I used the toilet 12 times in a six hour period. At the end of the bout I began to pass bright red blood in toilet. It was fresh blood and easy to tell what it was. I passed it about three times then it went away. Had what I thought were cold chills but could easily have been fatigue as well. CT saw no sign of diverticulitis. I followed up with my doctor who dismissed it all as IBS. Stating that D can at times cause bleeding. I have had roids in the past. Possible I popped one during that awful bout of D which produced the blood. I have had daily sigmoid pain from just under belly button to the lower left abdominal area and my usual IBS descending colon pain ever since the attack hit me. Bladder issues as well. Painful bladder/pelvic issues related to fullness,sometimes urinating and when bending,moving,etc.. I mentioned the bladder issues also. But since the ct scan stated my bladder,testicles and prostate looked unremarkable the doc thinks ...I assume...that it is IC which is associated with IBS. She prescribed elavil to me which she states is used for IC and IBS. She also thought it would help with chronic sciatica I have due to lower back issues. I have many questions. Did my 2014 scope miss the diverticulosis or did it occur since? Did I actually have a mild uncomplicated diverticulitis attack that the ct scan just didnt detect? Is the blood from roids or a bleeding diverticula? Which does not have to be due to duverticulitis as they can bleed on their own uninflamed and without infection. Do I need another scope so soon? Its only been 20 months. I am confused over it all really. If not for the blood. I probably would chalk it up to an IBS flare. But blood is a red flag sign.

"Hi. Since midday Sunday I've been experiencing a really bad IBS flare up. Saturday was a good day for me, stomach wise, so I wasn't really watching what I was eating. In the evening I ate a creamy mushroom risotto, an ice cream, a fair bit of chocolate, and some sweets. Probably not a good idea I know.
Sunday morning I was experiencing stomach ache, and then midday I had a bout of diarrhea, followed by another bout shortly after, and a couple more bouts throughout the day. Monday morning I passed a solid stool first of all (although still rather soft), but then had two more rather urgent trips to the bathroom in the morning which got progressively looser,and eventually turned into diarrhea. I took a codeine phosphate which my dr prescribed for me, and I didn't have another bowel movement for the rest of the day, although I did still experience stomach ache,and had to rush to the loo a few times thinking I had diarrhea, but it just turned out to be wind.
This morning, as soon as I woke up, I've been having really loose stools/diarrhea again, and bad stomach cramps. I'm also now passing mucas.
I also suffer from anxiety, and it's making me feel anxious that it's not going to stop, and I'm worrying as I have work tomorrow.
Is it normal for a flare up to last this long? I've never had it this bad for this long before. I'm assuming it is a flare up and not a stomach bug, as I don't feel unwell.
I would really appreciate any advice or to hear anyone else's experiences.
Thanks in advance.

"Hiya, I'm a 20 year old student who has recently been diagnosed with ibs.
I am constantly bloated and have a feeling that I need to go to the toilet all the time, even though I don't. It is evident that my bowel movements are loose but when I'm travelling or socialising or at an event I get paranoid that I've actually poo'd myself and need to find the nearest toilet to check (even though I haven't and haven't done so before)
I haven't experienced anxiety before but when this feeling occurs, especially in public I feel like everyone is looking at me; even though nothing has actually happened.
I was wondering if anyone else has this issue and whether there is certain tablets I can take to ease the bloating & diarrhoea. I will take any recommendations!
I have already altered my diet, I'm quite healthy, and I'm taking a few supplements. I'm not in loads of pain however the feeling of 'pooing' myself is affecting my day to day life.
Hope someone can help!

"My doctor thinks I may have IBS. I have been suffering from some abdominal discomfort on and off for a couple of months but since end July I have started vomiting as well. I can be perfectly fine for a couple if days, sometimes as long as a week or even a week and a half and then I start with the abdominal pain which is usually in the upper abdomen. This is followed by loud gurgling in the lower abdomen and then the retching starts. I can be backwards and forwards to the toilet for several hours just retching before I start to actually vomit. This generally lasts for 7-10 hours and then I start to recover. It is really getting me down. Has anyone experienced anything similar and if so how have you dealt with it? Thanks

"I'm a 20 year old female, and I've been having these problems since I was about 15. It all started with some really bad stomach cramps I would get at evening and night times, my mum took me to the doctor and they immediately brushed it off as bad periods and put me on the pill, despite me telling them it was my stomach, not the lower abdomen. He also diagnosed me with IBS. 
Skip a few years, the symptoms have been getting somewhat worse - in the last 2-3 years now I've been suffering with excruciatingly painful cramps that have left me bed bound for hours, I've missed so much work and time with my family and friends because I'm just too weak to get out of bed. I occasionally have mucus and blood in my stool (that is when I can go - a lot of the time I am blocked up for days), have vomiting episodes when the pain is particularly bad, joint pain, terrible lower back pain and blackout headaches similar to migraines. 
My last trip to a&e, the triage sent me up to gynae for a scan. The told me I had a tipped uterus pressing against my bowel and left ovary but was nothing to worry about.

"I guess this is my way of reaching out to someone for some help, or just someone I can speak to about what I'm going through..
I'm 19 and over the last 4 years I've been in and out of hospital with horrific stomach pains. They try to tell me I have a urine infection despite tests showing up negative or they say it's appendicitis and set me up for surgery, only to tell me it's not and send me home. I had a short spell of pancreatitis and they found an inflamed bile duct, but never told me what this meant. I've seen 10+ doctors; been for around 20 ultrasounds; a promise of an MRCP that never happened, 100's of blood tests and sample pots that get sent off and never reveal an answer.
My current doctor says he thinks it may be IBS because there's nothing left to test for anymore and has prescribed me with lobramide and buscopan, but hasn't provided me with any information or support, and I don't want to have to search all over the internet, I'd rather just speak with other people, someone that can relate to me and give me tips on what to do. I don't have any family or friends that can help with this and no one else seems to understand the frustration and agony of living like this.
Going back four years, my main problem was the pain, coming every two or three weeks and leaving me bent over, screaming in agony until someone called a doctor or an ambulance. I could never figure out what was causing it. I stopped drinking pepsi as I'd get pains like someone was stabbing me from the inside out all over my abdomen that would pass within 30 minutes, and I no longer drink alcohol due to fear pancreatitis will come back.
But recently, the pains have been constant -- all day, every day. It doesn't matter what I eat or if I don't eat at all, it feels like sharp stabbing pains, 8 times out of 10 it's on the left, but also feels like pressure.. Like I'm full of air and the slightest movement is agonising and feels like I'm going to burst. I'm bloated 24/7. If get the urge to go to the toilet about 15 seconds before the pain intensifies by 100% and I barely have the chance to get to a bathroom in time. I'm constipated in the morning but by night it's the complete opposite, going about 10 times a day.
I had to quit my job as a care assistant as the pains were too much to bare on my feet all day, and I'm now bound to office work and call centres, which is embarrassing when you have to sprint past 400 people to reach the bathroom, or if the urge comes while I'm on the phone to a customer. I lost a job a few weeks back due to being off sick and I'm afraid I'll lose my current job also if I don't find an answer quickly. If the pain is too bad, I can't make the journey to work, so not only am I ill and in pain, I'm stressed over job security and money.
Please, if anyone has taken the time to read this and feels they may have a spare few minutes to share their experiences with me, hints and tips on the do's and don'ts, anything you feel may help, or you just feel that you could be a friend to me, someone to relate to and just discuss how our day has been and how we're feeling, I'd really appreciate it. I feel so alone and isolated living like this and I just don't know what else to do. Every day is constant agony when all I want to do is have fun and live a normal life.

"I was offically diagnosed with the more severe type of ibs about a year ago. I have pain and cramps every day. The pain is always worse in the mornings and after meals. In the mornings I go to the toilet and usually have a fairly normal looking poo at first. About half an hour later I will go again and have diarrhoea. Sometimes I will also need to go again before I leave the house. I get really anxious if I know I need to be anywhere early in the morning.
My ibs really gets me down at times when it flares up. I take anti diarrhoea most days and buscapan when the cramps are bad. I am constantly worried about needing a poo whilst out because when I need one it comes with urgency. My anxiety is usually bad when my ibs is bad and is a constant battle because anxiety can make ibs worse.
I was wondering if theres anyone else out there who is going through the same thing? What foods do you avoid because I have struggled to identify all foods that are culprits?

"Diagnosed with IBS over 20 years ago. Well, GP didnt really do any tests but I kept going back and in the end they basically told me to go away!
To be honest, I've never been right but past year or so its been worse.
Diarrhoea is the problem. Some days I'm ok some days not. I seem to be taking much more imodium than I used to.
I rarely get stomach pain, never constipation, but its a real inconvenience to say the least.
Im the first to admit my diet is terrible, I'm well overweight (so deffo no weight loss here!) but apart from that, I dont feel unwell or tired or anything like that. I do have a very stressful job and am a very stressy person (depression/anxiety problems in the past).
Not sure if its related but I've had problems with piles a few months ago (needed hospital treatment). Apart from when I get that - no problems with blood generally.
But, I went  back to GP recently - my wife made me. Reluctantly they did blood tests  (dont think it was full) inc inflamatory thingy. Got home today (3 days after tests) to find a letter asking me to go back for repeat blood tests in 3-4 weeks - bone profile and full blood count.
My wife (whos a nurse) is thinking colitis or crohns or something. And I think the worst?
But like I said I've not really got other symptoms.....
Is it possible my bloods have shown up inflamatory markers?
Also, why blood tests in 3-4week why not now?

I went through a few weeks of having an upset tummy. After it didn't ease off As it was every day, went to the doctors and I provided a stool sample as they thought I might have caught a holiday bug recently in Cyprus. The tests results have come back all clear so I now have another appointment on Friday. IBS runs in the family and it does sound extremely similar but is it? I can be fine for 3 ish days then all of a sudden my tummy swells and then I have upset tummy for a day then I'm ok again?!?! No blood, just bloated and upset tum. I've tried to see if a particular food triggers it however it's not normally just after I eat and can be the next morning
Any advise would be much appreciated. I am also dead set against a endoscopy as I had one before and it was the worst thing one ever done - will I have to have another?
Am I stressing too much it could be something worse like the big C even though I know chances are slim and doctor doesn't seem too worried??

"I'm currently trying to identify whether any foods make my IBS symptoms worse but I'm not quite sure how to pinpoint exactly.
If you ate a food that was a problem, how soon after do you think you would feel the effects?
I should mention my IBS is constipation predominant so I do not get any dashes to the loo as a result of eating anything in particular. I have low level pain all the time and then every so often it will get worse for a few days to a week.
This will probably sound a silly question, but does to particular food have to reach your colon to trigger symptoms? As I've always wondered how people can be affected so quickly after eating something. It must have some effect earlier in the digestive tract? Would this contribute to pain?
Sorry so many questions - just trying to work out how it works really!

Noe, since last week my bm has increased but they are sloppy, once yellow and ive lost 4lbs in 2 weeks since its started. Ive gone to a Gatro specialist yesterday and he has ordered a colonoscopy to check whats going on.
My anxiety has hit the roof. I have genuinely decreased my calorie intake over the weeks as my partner wasnt eating ing much so i didnt. My partner is better now but im the same!!!
Its the weight loss which means cancer!!

"Ok to start off I'm 25 years old with no history of colon cancer in my family. I feel like I have had ibs for about 6 years now. It started with a bloathe that I layer realized was caused by constipation. Also I would tend to get bouts of diareah after eating out. Anyways idk if I'm just a hypochondriac but I recently looked up what an ""ideal poop"" looks like and it's been all downhill. I noticed that I started having floating stool and shortly after last my appetite not sure if it's related but also was and still currently going through major stress. Mainly concerning my health, I could just be overreacting. Since then I noticed my stools have been relatively flat for about 2 weeks could have been longer just started really examining it. Sometimeso they tend to be thinner and sometimes thicker,but with edges. Also for the past 2 days my first bowel starts with the ""ideal log"" then tapers into a softer poop with edges. I'm terrified it could be cancer just a awhile ago though a passed a bowel that was on the slimmer side wouldn't say pencil thin, but with no edges. Really confuses I also have a hard time passing soft stool I wouldn't say constipated because I go at least twice a day. I recently increased my fiber intake and I suspect it could be hemmeroids or possibly a pelvic floor issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"Hi everyone, really needing some advice if possible. For over 3 years I have suffered this pain in my pelvic area (I'm a female). It comes and goes but when I am having boewl troubles this is where the pain is. Iat first I thought it was gynacolical but have had every test under the sun in that area and all clear. I've have now been waiting 8 months to see a bowel  specialist but will be new year before I get. (My GP is unfriendly, and always says it's ibs)The pain is usually worst during ovulation and can actually be crippling at time and my pelvic area swells out too, during this it is mostly mucus I pass or wee small hard stools. To be honest the way I describe the pain is like a fish being gutted. Today again I felt the pain low down, cramps pain but passed with wind (sorry for too much info). 
Please can anyone give advice or have similar, I feel like it's taking over my life and cannot understand why the doctors say it is my bowel I never imagined bowel pain would be so low in the pelvic area.

"I've been diagnosed with IBS for about 3-4yrs now. Funny / Sad thing is I self-diagnosed & it was confirmed by my doctor at the time that I have it. I saw the pamphlet at the doctor's office; picked it up & read what it said. Sadly I checked off I think all but two of the symptoms mentioned in said info pamphlet.

Stomach Cramps that are usually in the middle/lower abdomen - Check
Runs & Constipation - Check
Bloating and Gas - DOUBLE Check 
Severe pain in my right AND OR left flank / back - check? 
I don't know if the sudden onset of pain is from IBS or if it is something else going on. I've been to the emergency room on multiple occasions if it's on the left side they kinda shrug it off on the right side they usually make me chug things to ensure it's not my gallbladder or pancreas.
Today I made a breakfast of grilled chicken, a bit of shredded cheese, lettuce, and a squirt or two of Ranch dressing. First bite I get sudden left side pain that's in the middle from back to stomach. Given my whole stomach was cramping & starting to bloat. Severe nausea and just an overall feeling of 'ick'. I don't know at this point when this type of thing happens & it's been going on since 10am & it's 8pm. Everything I try to eat/drink makes my stomach suddenly hurt or severe nausea .. or both!
Is this something I should go to the ER or a doctor for at this point I've had a hot bath, downed Pepto about three times when the nausea was too much to handle. Haven't puked but been really close a few times. 
I moved from SC to GA on the 1st of Aug, so i'm still in the process of finding doctors for my health issues and at this point I'm feeling extremely frustrated because until today I'd been a lil crampy but nothing this bad.

"I am experiencing the same thing every night.  I go to sleep and about one hour later I feel pressure in my rectum and vagina as though I need to have a bowel movement. I manage to go but the stools are thin or like pebbles. This continues during the night at half or one hour intervals.  When morning comes I am always able to defecate more succcessfully at 7.00am.  I have looked on the internet and I am unable to find anyone else with these bizarre symptoms.  There is frequently a brief moment of  flatulence during the nocturnal BMs.  Last night I had to get up 10 times and although I can always get to sleep straight away when I get back into bed, I feel totally exhausted during the day.
My doctor has just told me that I have small external haemmoroids, which have obviously come because I'm straining during the night.
Every day I find that I am able to walk okay until about lunch time, then the pain in my vagina and rectum kicks in and all activity is painful and I end up hobbling around instead of being the active person who used to walk for miles every day with my dogs.  I have had a flexible sigmoidoscopy which revealed diverticular disease but I haven't read of anyone who is as troubled at night as I am. 
I am trying to avoid dairy products and gluten at the moment, to see if that helps as I love DIY and walking in the countryside, and I am in too much pain to do either, and on many days I am unable to anything other than sit on a doughnut cushion in agony.   (In recent years I have been unable to wear pants or tights due to vulvodynia)  My problems have affected my social life as I frequently have to decline invitations due to these health problems.
Lastly, I have ordered some tigernuts online as I have read that they help digestion.  Has anyone else had success with eating them?
During the day I find I am having BMs

"I know I've posted similar before, yet these worries still seem to persist...
I recently started back therapy in which to no surprise she found my currently emotionally abusive/high stress situation has led to severe depression/anxiety, along with a multitude of symptoms.
Though as of last night after my therapy appointment (and a bit more stress to boot) I've been having the WORST stomachaches. Sharp/dull mixed, and sometimes they're noisy too. Kind of like a gurgly noise I guess? I know in the past I was diagnosed with acid reflux (I was about 6 or 7 at the time, and I'm 16 now) but these stomachaches seem particularly bad.
I went from being severely constipated with gas/chest/lower back pains alike to as of a few hours ago running to the bathroom at least two or three times with a mix of regular and extremely soft almost liquid stool. The day before I also had a ball of what I think was white mucus in the mix but that was the only time that appeared discounting the month prior where there was an excessive amount of regular mucus and orange-hued mucus alike.
As far as I'm aware cancers like bowel/colon don't run in my family, but since my grandmother has recently gotten diagnosed with colon cancer my brain has been OBSESSED with assuming that's what it is. Paired with the nausea, chills, insomnia, and other various pains, I'm almost convinced my days are numbered. I'm also a little worried it might be something as mild as food poisoning too, but I can't remember how long ago I ate and I don't have any food allergies as far as I know. (If anything my appetite fluctates on a regular basis)
I feel like I should also mention that early last month I had a CBC and the only thing that showed was hypothyroidism and low vitamin d, but i'm unsure at the moment if those are fixing themselves or if my vitamins/given medication for this are helping. I haven't really taken either in a while though...everything else in that regard showed up fine/normal.
Has anyone else experienced symptoms similar to these? How did you handle them? Any advice would be appreciated.

"I have Ibs-c and I was tested for coeliac 2 years ago which came out negative. I was recently recommended by a friend to try gluten free so I went out and bought a guide. I read that anyone who suffers from a rash called dermatitis herpetiformis will definitely have coeliac. After reading the description of the rash and looking at pictures online, it appears and is identical to a rash I've been suffering from, on and off, for the past year or so. When I first showed my doctor my rash he was unsure of it and gave me cream. Another doctor said it was a form of eczema, however, it is unlike the eczema I get on the rest of my body. I have also been suffering from many non-gastrointestinal symptoms of coeliac (as the gastrointestinal ones are exactly the same as Ibs) such as iron deficiency anaemia and acne. I'm not really sure of my next move as my faith in the blood and stool tests has somewhat gone. Any advice?

"I am a 20 year old female. I was just recently diagnosed abouth a month ago with IBS after reporting symptoms of chronic abdomin pains with constipation, bloating, and foul smelling wind. I have cut out lactose and gluten and starting walking on a gentle track with a slight slope. I have discovered I am gluten intolerant, because anytime I accidently have gluten my cramps kick in within 10 minutes. I am only lactose sensitive. I can eat some lactose and not feel any effects, but if I go overboard I react, mainly with gas. Along with these things I've noticed that I also feel inflammed by chocolate, citrius acid, sugar, and caffeine. I keep a regular schedule of eating times to keep from flare ups, but when I miss my time even by 30 minutes my stomach acts up immediatly. I always feel hungry even after I eat and I know my stomach can't handle more than a regular serving.
My main question is my stomach pains are still pretty regular daily. I rarely have a time during the day where I'm not cramping or have some form of rumbles or gas. My pain has recently become this intense painful growling feeling. Instead of my stomach make a growling noise I just feel it along with pain that feels deeper than normal cramps. Has anyone else experieced this same feeling with IBS? Is there more I can do to regain control of my body or is it just something that takes time with practice and experimenting? I'd love to hear inputs of what I could try to make my symptoms less intense.

"I recently turned 18 and was diagnosed with IBS in September 2014, usually it's been easy to deal with, occasional mild pain which could be treated with my prescription of buscopan as well as knowing I've ate something that doesn't agree with diarrhoea the next day.
For about a week now I have been experiencing chronic abdomen pain to the point where I feel nauseous and my bowel movements have increased by a lot, this is because of the pain, it feels like there is pressure on my intestines and that I'm not getting all the stool out however hard I try. The pain doesn't go completely with buscopan and I have no idea on what this could be.
Is this normal? Should I change my medication? Please help.

"I know I've come to this forum before with something familiar, but just as I was starting to get my worries somewhat under control...
As I mentioned in posts prior, I suffer heavily on a daily basis severe anxiety/stress/depression (all of which have been getting worse), and as of late I haven't neccessarily been eating/drinking as much as I used to. I don't have the energy or really the 'urge' for either most days, though there are periods where I'm extremely thirsty no matter how much water I drink.
As of last night I've been getting the worst sharp stomach pains! Abdomen/middle stomach/belly button area, and I had just gotten over 'that time' of month so I know it's not that...I haven't been able to 'go' much either, if at all. Prunes and general laxatives don't work well anymore if at all either. Fiber just makes my stomach pains worse.
I barely 'went' at all just about 30 minutes ago, and the stool that showed (sorry for graphics??) was almost completely round, but a dark color. I didn't see any blood though...
I'm 16, almost 17, and I'm terrified of cancer. (I've been battling fears of bowel/colon cancer and leukemia for about a month or two now.) Has anyone ever experienced this kind of symptom? How did you fix it?? I can't exactly 'relax', either, no matter how much i try...

"Can Anyone Help Me Understand My Symptoms?
 I'm 62 years old. My 92-year-old father died in April of 2016. Simutaneously, I had a verbal fight and a falling-out with an old friend.Wouldn't ya know it, starting right about then, I slowly began to experience constipation. On May 15th I finally went to the emergency room after I hadn't had a BM in about ten days straight. I could see everything backed-up on the CT scan of my GI tract.
 With the onset of my constipation, I also experienced increasing episodes of brain fog, mental tension, and mental fatigue (all at the same time). It felt as though my head was in a cloud that was pressing down on me. Like a hangover without the drinking. No pain...just pressure. (there's that word 'press' again.) These brain episodes don't come and go quickly; they hang around for three to four hours, seemingly coinciding with food going through my small intestine. I envision the food pressing on neurons on its way through, incorrectly sending errant signals to my brain.
 Finally, enough doctors and others put it together that I was depressed over my father's recent passing, and perhaps the fight with my friend as well.
 Either way, my irregular BMs started then, and continue to the present day. (August 2016) I use polyethylene glycol or metamucil to try to keep things regular, with some success. I'm IBS-C (constipation dominant).
 Knowing what I know now, it's easy for me to see that I also acquired some kind of free-floating anxiety disorder. Sometimes I get the tingles of an anxiety episode coming on, but it really never blooms into a full attack.
 But the depression cloud around my head, usually lasting for hours, is the most prominent symptom.
 During these episodes, I don't have any conscious worries, no depressive notions. No sad thoughts. Nothing. Just the unidentifiable cloud of pressure. If this is a form of depression, it's unlike any I've ever heard of.
 Here's the part of the story that I could use some help with: I have no pain or discomfort in my abdomen at all. No cramping. No urgency or other GI symptoms. Not even a little. Not even when it takes me three to five days to have a BM...there's never any pain down there. Ever.
 My question is...why do the neurons in my small intestine transfer signals to my head in the form of a depressive cloud?
Why do I feel the discomfort around my head instead of in my abdomen? I know it has to do with sensory abnormalities and central nervous system abnormalities. Does anyone know?
 (My doctor prescribed a 25mg dose of Sertaline to address the problem. I've been on it for two weeks, but it's causing numbness in my left leg.)
 Sincerely,
                 Metro

"Hi, I've been suffering with IBSC for about 3 years now (sometimes with diarrhoea if I get a blockage). I've discovered I'm lactose intolerant (2years ago) but I'm now considering gluten intolerance? I've been off gluten for about a month (apart from porridge oats) and haven't noticed much difference except that carbs don't sit heavy on my stomach. Today, however, I woke with serious constipation (been to the toilet 6 times with only a little coming out) and huge cramps. I thought I had a blockage so I bought some liquid paraffin which seemed to get some out but not all. I feel I'm putting too much stress on my family and boyfriend, with my changing, strict diets and symptoms. Going to the drs next week for acne (possibly related to ibs?) so hope to find out some more info but unlikely. Can Anyone help me with my blockages?? (I feel like everyone is ibsD!! Lol)

"I started with IBS 8 years ago around the same time my Mam had one of her legs amputated so I think mine's definitely stress-related and started because of that. When I first started with it, I wouldn't go anywhere apart from home, work and family members' houses. I thought I was going crazy at first and having some kind of mental breakdown but I wasn't. My main issue is the sudden and unpredicted urge to need the loo, which obviously I never know is going to happen and have no control over when it decides to do it. After seeing a specialist at the hospital and having various tests (colonoscopy, Gamma Ray scan, blood tests) I was discharged and told it was probably just IBS. I take more ownership of it these days but it does control and dictate me a lot still. I panic about being anywhere if there's no toilet nearby. If I go somewhere new I need to know where the toilet is. I love travelling and going to gigs so I block myself up with cheap Immodium so it takes away the worry and I can still do normal stuff. Then I get in another strange scenario when I don't know when the pills will wear off and result in that sudden urge again. It's not ideal as my bowels are all over the place and I go from having diarrhoea symptoms to having constipation. I have to pre-plan ahead with everything. I just wish there was a happy medium somewhere. I'd love to be able to empty my bowels at a predicted set time to take away any possible issues. I'm a very positive person the majority of the time but having IBS really does make me feel miserable sometimes. Does anyone else manage their IBS any differently? Any hints and tips?

"Hello there, I don't know if anybody might be able to help.
I'm a 23 year old female and for the past seven weeks I have been experiencing issues with constipation. I am in low level pain most of the time and every couple of days it will get worse, like a cramping. When it is this bad, I cannot sleep. I have lost ten pounds in weight because I am struggling to eat with the pain and nausea.
I have seen several different doctors and tried several laxatives. Last week I took a high dose of Movicol and experienced diarrhoea for several days, so I thought the problem had resolved. However, I saw a GP out of hours after that (due to bad pain) who confirmed I still had stuff in there! So I took Movicol again for a few days along with one docusate (DulcoEase) pill a day (lower dose - between 2 and 4 a day) and when I saw the GP on Wednesday (2 days ago), he felt my abdomen and did not seem to think I was constipated any longer and to eat normally. I ate a meal that evening but by the next day I was in dull pain again and feeling extremely nauseous. I suffer badly with anxiety too (four years of anxiety disorder) so this did not help matters. This morning I did not get to bed until 5am due to the pain and am relying on heat pads (which have burnt my skin) because I am unsure if painkillers will exacerbate things.
As I type I am in pain, and I don't know what to do. To me, my abdomen feels hard again - I can feel stuff in there but I cannot pass anything solid and haven't done for a month (only liquid). It seems like my bowel just will not move things along. Everything just sort of sits there unless I cause the opposite problem of diarrhoea with high doses of Movicol.
I don't know what to do. I am at the end of my tether, in so much pain and discomfort and struggling to eat (partly because of how I feel physically and partly because I'm worried about overloading myself). I am not sure if diet contributes to my issues because I've not really been eating much to cause it! I am also having anxiety attacks because I'm so worried it won't sort. I am so desperate to just have normal bowel movements. I've not had a normal pattern since the end of May.
Any advice would be much appreciated. Apologies for the length of this post!

"I have suffered with IBS for some years now and had a sigmoidoscopy 4 years ago. My IBS symptoms have usually been abdomen aches and pains in the morning and the feeling of needing the toilet but never being able to go. In the last couple of months though my symptoms have changed and I find myself going to the toilet more often with loose stools. Has this ever happened to anyone before where your IBS symptoms have gone from one extreme to another? It worries me this might be something a little more sinister however I take comfort in the fact I had tests done 4 years ago and it takes a long time for anything nasty to develop as far as I am aware. I have had doctors appointment and had a stool sample test so I am awaiting the results of that. I've not noticed any blood or anything in my stool either. The loose stool and going more often is not constant either. There has been a day or two respite in between where things have been fairly normal. Thanks for your help.

"I am a 24-year-old female who is experiencing daily nausea, usually 2-3 times a day in the afternoon and evening. It will come in waves, be very intense for about 10-25 minutes, then I feel fine, even better afterwards. When I feel this way I also feel like I all of the sudden have to go to the bathroom, even if I don't. Sometimes if I try to go to the bathroom I feel like i'm going to puke, or pass out.
I would just say it's IBS, but my doctors don't agree.
I know I have gallstones, afib, and supposedly GERD, do these symptoms fall into place with any of those?
My cardiologist seems to think we should look into the vagus nerve, as I do get pale and shaky and near passing out when it hits.
This has been going on for about 1.5 years now, and i'm still not used to it. About 3 years back when I was partying in college I used to actually seize and pass out (only 3 times) when I was drinking/partaking in party stuff, but I haven't seized in years.

I take Imodium and make sure I have some at all times just incasr and I won't leave the house unless I have it. I was just here hoping to see if there is anything that works just the same as Imodium but is stronger or more effective? Thanks

"Just need some peace of mind
I have gerd and after taking probiotic supplements for a couple weeks, I've been doing really well (no nausea, great eating/digesting, etc.) but over the past couple of days, I've been having chest and breathing problems (shortness of breath, can't breathe in deeply sometimes).
I go up to big bear early tomorrow and don't come back till Sunday... I'm worried that I should be seeing a doctor ASAP since breathing is an important thing.. will the couple of days make a huge difference? I feel like if it's just related to my acid reflux, I should be fine...? Or should I call my doctor at least before I leave? Do they even have medicine for breathing problems caused by GERD? Help! I'm worried...

"Hi guys, I'm 20 years old and have been told I have had ibs since I was 12. I have had various tests and they have always came back clear and normal so back in March I got referred to a dietician whom then told me about the fodmap diet which helps at least 75% of those who have ibs, I done the diet for 2 months having high hopes but shock.. It didn't work for me as I was still having the same horrible symptoms! I am confused as I thought ibs is triggered by certain foods and if they are eliminated from your diet then you should be feeling better?? Has anyone else done this diet? If so what was your experiences with it? And what's the next step of its not worked?

"I am a twenty year old female. Last Friday evening (7/15/16) I began having diarrhea that was very frequent and persisted through most of the night. In the morning, however, I felt better and had gone kayaking. I also ate bread, cheese, and salami as part of a picnic afterwards, which in hindsight I know wasn't smart. The following afternoon, the diarrhea worsened and so did the stomach pain. Previously, the stomach pain would be alleviated after a bowel movement, but the pain stayed around for longer it seemed the rest of the weekend, even after having gone to the bathroom. Mind you, I would go up to, if not more than, 10 times a day. That's very frequent diarrhea. That Saturday night was horrible. My mom had gotten me imodium, which did slow down the diarrhea, but the stomach pain wasn't going anywhere. Sunday morning, there was blood in my diarrhea. I knew that was a bad sign, so I informed my mom, and we went to the doctor. They told my mom to stop giving me imodium because they didn't want to keep the bacteria from leaving through bowel movements, and they gave me something to collect a stool sample with as well as a prescription for some medical probiotics (VSL#3, i think. It's like the extra strength one). We picked up the probiotics, and I had two packets that day. I realize that was a lot. On Monday, since I had been up the whole previous night making trips to the bathroom, I stayed home from work. I used that time to collect a stool sample and bring it to my doctor to be tested. They had to send it to a lab, so I wouldn't know my results for a week. Meanwhile, Monday I felt much better. Sunday had by far been the worst day. On Monday, I had one more packet of the probiotics, but didn't eat it all in one sitting, but rather two sittings in the morning and night (I had been putting it in apple sauce). Also, it should be noted that I followed a very bland diet all of Sunday and Monday. By Tuesday, I was well enough to return to work and it seemed that I was in recovery mode. The diarrhea had stopped, but my stool was still very soft--an improvement I was happy about. That was the norm the whole week along with normally timed bowel movements. Now yesterday (7/24/16), I went out to dinner with my family to an Asian fusion restaurant and got a spicy oily dish to eat. Then at night, I woke up twice and had diarrhea. Then I had diarrhea twice this morning (7/25/16). I don't know what is the matter with me. Was a week not enough recovery time? Did the food further irritate a problem that hadn't fully healed? I'm afraid I have IBS or something, though I read it isn't common to wake up in the middle of the night due to bowel movements if one has IBS. My test results regarding my stool also came back negative for anything. There was nothing wrong. I tried eating more bland food again today and taking in more probiotics. I got by period this past Saturday and recently started a new BCP this month, Gianvi. Could that combined with my period have anything to do with my stomach issues? I am a healthy person. Slightly overweight, but good blood pressure and a healthy heart rate. I eat a relatively healthy diet--I hadn't even been eating much leading up to the whole diarrhea thing. A small snack or lunch during the day with a good portioned dinner that included all the food groups. My family doesn't have a history of sensitive stomachs. I don't even usually have a sensitive stomach. I am used to eating a lot of different foods from different ethnicities and have never had any problems. What's wrong with me? I'm worried this is going to become a chronic issue or something. I'll also note I feel I have been more gassy. I've always done little, frequent burps--so that wasn't new--but also just farting every stinking time I go to the bathroom. That isn't normal for me. And if it means anything, I've had two UTI's this past year. I had never had one before this year, but I also became sexually active this year, so..idk. Either way, the first one was bad--it was the whole shebang with blood and what not--got that diagnosed and took antibiotics. The second one wasn't as bad, no blood, seemed to heal itself after I drank some apple cider vinegar cuz when I was finally able to get to a doctor and get tested they said I was fine.  Please help.

"I have to admit I'm truly baffled so please bear with me. I have some strange goings on but don't know if the problem related to ongoing vaginal yeast infection or to some strange kind of IBS.
Basically I have been getting bizarre stools since a gastric infection of some sort in December - while living in a cottage with a private water supply. I'm guessing I hot Guardiasis but by the time I went to the doctor with a stool sample, many months had passed since the infection and nothing showed - apart from some rectal bleeding.
A colonoscopy showed nothing apart from a couple of bleeding haemorrhoids so I was discharged and told by GP to keep taking Laxido for chronic constipation.
However, the thing is that my poops aren't dark and I don't have abdominal problems currently - I just seem to not need to go. And when I do my stools are hard little pale pebbles with things that look like pine nuts in them? As nothing has shown up in the stool samples I've handed in nor the colonoscopy I don't really know what is going on.
I have had uncharacteristic bouts of vaginal thrush simultaneously - both constipation/ strand stools and thrush arrived this year out of the blue. The latest thing is that I have what looks like white grains of sand in my pants and I can't tell which part of my undercarriage it's coming from. Any ideas? I take Acidophilus Max everyday and have multi system autoimmune problems. None of this causes discomfort but it does just seem very odd and my other problems flare and remit.

"Hi there, I am a 23 year old female who would like some answers.
 I'll make a long story short. For nearly 2 years now I've been dealing with a stomach/digestive issues, and my dr has no idea what it is. I've been booked for a specialist appt. soon, but that's not for another few months.
I do have some anxiety, but the symptoms come and go, and have began to get worse rapidly. I'm wondering it it's possibly IBS or if it's something worse? 
These are my symptoms:
- Excessive burping with metallic taste
- sour stomach / churning stomach (I can hear it)
- loss of appitite
- weight loss 
- swelling stomach/ terrible bloating
- random intense burning sensasion in abdomen, that lasts for hours (even wakes me from my sleep)
- Diahrrea 
- fever / chills, come and go. I get random hot flashes where my back is burning hot and I'm actually sweating.
- anything i eat seems to go right though me some days, not always but it's getting to the point I can barely stand to eat anything
- neausea / sour stomach at random times
- when I lay on my back, my stomach sinking in, that slight pressure causes that awful burning sensation throughout my entire torso. 
- Dr felt a tender spot on my lower left side, just above my hip (near belly button) that when pressed, is painful and upsets entire stomach. 
- also, on my period the burning pain doesn't stop. It's constant, and bloats my stomach. It feels like there's fire burning inside and nothing takes it away, I usually have to sleep it off.  I've had regular cramps in the past, when I first began my period (i was 15) and now it's been just god-awful, burning pain that nothing takes away. 
- also get terrible aches in spine now and then, that last anywhere from 15-45 mins. This has happened more than a few times. 
I've had to leave my full time job due to the stress, and constant feeling of being unwell. I'm tired of not knowing what this could be. 
 I've been through 5 labs of blood work, urin samples, ultrasounds (for my ovaries and abdomen) and nothing's been found. 
Anyone have any related symptoms like this? Or have an idea of what this could be? 
Thank you so much for your time.

"Has anyone found their ibs is made worse by exercise? I know gentle exercise is good for keeping bowels moving etc, but I have noticed I sometimes get worse at the weekend- this is when I do my most strenuous exercise. I originally thought it was because I'm a bit more lax with my diet at the weekend, but I did a fairly hard session last night and have been bad today. Could be coincidence but I'm wondering if the blood flow restriction and return to the gut whilst exercising could be causing the flare?

"This is very long, the crucial parts are in bold. 
I'm 25, male, and in good shape. I've had severe digestive problems for 2-3 years now, through trial and error I've discovered the following definite sensitivies / conditions: 
-Oxalates (I think I have kind calcium oxalate stones)
-Salicylates
-Hemorrhoids 
-Pancreatic enzyme deficiency (ie: yellow, loose, poorly formed and very oily stool, pretty sure taking adderall as perscribed for 2 years did this, I don't know how exactly, but the problem is largely (70-80%) resolved by ceasing adderall and taking Creon (and I did try each independently to no success) 
Suspected:
-Amines
-Gluten 
-Kidney stones
Remaining symptoms:
-Diarrhrea followed by severe multiday constipation: After eliminating the above dietary irritants and taking Creon and a probiotic with every meal I had the closest to normal bowels moments I've had all year, for two days, then the normalcy was followed by a day of constipation followed by a morning of diarrhea (I'm guessing overflow) and now 2 going on 3 days of constipation and a dull ache on my left side (that I am very familiar with). This is despite the 3 gallons of water and fiber tab I've taken today. Enough water helps with bloating but doesn't relieve the actual constipation. 
-Constant burping: Before meals, after meals, when I wake up, after drinking plain water...
-Very oily looking urine and particles with trailing ""plumes"" of oil: Almost every time I urinate there is oil, the urine can be crystal clear and there will still be oil, maybe every 2nd or third time there will be a ""smoke signal"" of oil the source of which I cannot see. I thought these were kidney stones but the symtpoms I'm reading for that are cloudy or discolored urine, mine is neither but the oil content appears higher in the morning when dehydrated. 
-Yellow eyes and broader anemia symptoms: They alternate between yellow and white throughout the day, the broader symptoms have gotten better with dietary changes. 
-Fatigue and disorientation/confusion/clumsiness: Some itchiness too, and my limbs seem to fall asleep more than I think they should. 
-Left hand spasms: Also in my left bicep. I'm thinking this might be related to the suspected kidney stones, I will start taking potassium citrate soon. 
My biggest questions are: 
What could be causing the blockage leading to multi-day constipation and what should I do about it?
What are the ""smoke signals"" of oil in my urine everyday? 
I should also note that I've been seeing a gastroenterologist for months now and they have so far been useless and never have suggestions of there own, so I'm in an endless cycle of pain, hypochondrianc level googling, asking for tests, tests coming back normal, rinse and repeat. In defense of hypochodriac googling, I owe every improvement thus far to the practice.
Well, I'm off to make a midnight run to the grocery store for more water (these days I dread leaving the house almost as much as I dread lines and crowds, the midnight crew can certainly recognize me from a half mile away by now...), thank you so much to anyone who reads this and has suggesstions. It's very depressing to realize my early 20's are being defined by debilitating digestive issues but there is so much quality information out there I know I'll stumble upon a root diagnosis eventually.

"Hi,
For the past 3-4 months now ive had recurring blood in my stool as well as small amounts of mucous with every single bowel movement. Im only 21 years old and have no family history of bowel cancer but im terrified that this is what it could be. All the symptoms im having match exactly to that. The blood is quite dark on the outside of the stool but very bright red when im wiping which is confusing. I was admitted to hospital a few weeks ago as the bleeding was quite significant amount wise, and have an outpatient colonoscopy scheduled for a few weeks time which im also feeling nervous about. I also have really foul smelling gas too with the occasional dull abdominal ache on my left hand side. I dont have the best diet in the world and certainly could be drinking more water. Im hoping someone has had similar symptoms to myself and tell me what it ended up being for them. I was recently diagnosed with PoTs where my heart races when standing up and excercising.

"Ok so here goes.
Been diagnosed with Globus (foreign sensation of something stuck in my throat) about 4 months ago.
I have a high rate of anxiety and been referred for CBT by my GP. I have had in the last 7 months the following
chest x-ray (Jan 2016) - normal
Scope down throat - normal
FBC (Mar 2016) - normal
Upper Endoscopy (Jun 2016) - normal
I am a 35yr old female, smoker & not a real drinker at all.
No weight loss reported to date HOWEVER ever since about 4 months ago I have noticed my bowels are not the same.
In the morning they are mushy not diarrohea just like a pile of mud, some days they can be normal and other days they can be a little harder. I have not noticed any red i.e. blood in the stools (but maybe it is not visible to me), my stomach has been aching now for the last 4 days (but my partner has too so I assume we have a little virus).
I am not vomitting or having any stomach pain (other than the last 4 days).
I have now resulted in getting another FBC (online home test kit) & a home bowel test kit to check for blood.
I fear going to the doctor as I know he will say its IBS and not listen to me due to my anxiety levels for the last 7 months.
What is the possibility of this being bowel cancer?
?Sorry for all of this but I am really scared....

"I finally got results back from my CBC + vitamin check. While everything else that is involved with that test is fine, my Vitamin D is low and they found out my thyroid is a bit low too. Not severely so, but enough to cause fatigue and chills and the like.
I've been suffering with awful stomach aches, aches near the kidneys, sharp stomach pain, and few BMs if any at all for the past while now. I've tried prune juice, eating prunes (an entire bag! which...just made more gas occur and my stomach incredibly noisy. going to the bathroom when this occured led to nothing), epsom salt (helped a little bit, but i didn't drink the full dose, only about 3/4th and even then i still felt uncomfortably full and achy.), and chewable laxatives which did nothing.
I'm 16, aside from what I listed + my consistently running high stress/anxiety/depression levels my health seems fine. I'm a hypochondriac too, which is why I got the CBC to begin with. If I had cancer, surely it'd show up as an infection or there'd be swollen lymph nodes? Neither of which showed. The only member of my family who has cancer right now is my grandmother, bowel cancer too. Though we're not genetically related since my mother was adopted and my father was not related to her. Because of my grandmother's bowel cancer, I'm afraid I have it. And I heard sharp stomach aches + thin stools /when/ you have a BM is a sign...it's the worst kind of panic!
My mother and father as far as I know do not have a history of cancer in their family. I inherit a lot from my mother's side (esp my defeciences ). I've been trying to eat better and exercise more, but I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I'll be away from home...is there any way to ease my cancer worries + have a more regulated BM?? Are these irregularities from what's in the title??? I don't know!!

"I genuinly don't wish to scare anyone but if you've had an irritable bowel syndrome 'diagnosis' I'd like you to read my story.
Our son, age 35 had tummy troubles for a few years, at first we all thought stress related maybe.  He went to GP a few times & was advised most likely stress, to take Buscopan & pain relief. After a while GP & a few return visits GP finally reckoned it was Irritable Bowel Syndrome & suggested our son monitor his diet. 
Stoic young man that he was he just went with the painful times which came & went, granted probably in the pattern of IBS.  2014 gained quite a lot of weight, not just belly area but more evenly all over. Mid 2015 he lost it all quite suddenly, we thought he looked 'better', back to his old weight though he said he'd been ill. Had been in/out of the GP's most of that year, constantly told IBS, use Buscopan.
In Sept 2015 GP suggested a dietician might help with the IBS so our son sourced a private one & she recommended he be checked that it was not Coeliac Disease as her diet suggestions would be different if from IBS.  Our son returned to GP & had blood test.  2 weeks later he was told it was NORMAL & he should go ahead with the IBS diet treatment.
As always through this whole sorry saga of IBS, improvement was intermittent.  Early Dec he was quite ill one weekend, pain, vomiting etc, but once again improved a day or two later.  7th December he was bad again & asked us to take him to A&E.
8th December we are told he has Bowel Cancer, the bowel has perforated & the cancer has spread to lymph glands & liver. It is terminal.  I'll leave out the intervening bits, suffice to say 7 WEEKS later our son died.
A completely NON proactive GP, fobbing our son off for years, not looking for anything other than IBS because our son was considered by him to be ""too young for bowel cancer"". Presumably he wanted to save the NHS money testing him for anything else his 'IBS' symptoms MIGHT have been.
My message to ANYONE of any age out there, who has been told they have IBS & is managing those symptoms, is to be warned.  If you have not had bowel cancer ruled out with a colonoscopy then YOU MUST INSIST on one......NOW!!!
We must live with 'if only' & 'what if'.  If only we had realised this could be more serious, what if our son had a proactive GP who would not jump to the easy conclusion but CHECK properly with the proper tests.  Ruling OUT more serious things which present with similar symptoms instead of ruling in IBS & never varying from that 'diagnosis'.
We must live the rest of our lives without our son now. Don't let that be you by being complacent, by being stoic & just getting on with things.  Our son, & us his parents, have paid the most tragic price.

"So I've been suffering from IBS for about  a year now, which has been 'confirmed' via ultrasound, colonoscopy, endoscopy, multiple blood tests etc. The only thing discovered was a slight hiatus hernia in the endo.
Now the only symptoms I'm getting are extreme flatulance usually after eating which will last for ages and even when not having eaten sometimes.
I also suffer from inconsistent bowel habits and a slight pain on right side under rib as my other symptoms.
Now, my question is what can I do about the flatulance? It's very annoying and is a very embarrassing issue at times. And can mass flatulance ever lead to any problems/be a problem in itself? 
I'm pretty young and in good health apart from this.

"I did have gastic flu/stomach bug 3 montsh a go. Since then Ive had mild abdominal cramps normally a result of trapped gas, which Ive had more than usual.  These have eased alot.  Stoll test came back fine, have not had any other tests down.  
Whilst I only get very occasional cramps I have noticed my stools they start off being compacted pellets almost and end in a looser stool - all in the same stool.  So on the Bristol stool chart a singe stool goes from type 2 through to type 4/5 all in the same stool.   I do get a slight burning feeling in my anus afterwards which can last a few hours (almost like its inflamed slightly).  I have no other symptoms, going every 1-2 days and the only thi ng I have is occasional probiotics, just started yesterday on DGL liquorice but the symptoms above have been going on for the last 2-3 weeks.
Has anyone had the same syptoms and know what it is?  is this IBS or something else?

"I’m 22 years old and I have been suffering from painful digestive symptoms. I started having these symptoms when I was in high school. I would wake up with painful stomach cramps, and I would feel very nauseous after I would eat my lunch. After high school my symptoms became worse. The symptoms I experience now are chronic. My symptoms include abdominal cramps, bloating with excessive gas, chronic diarrhea, repeated belching during and after meals, and discomfort of feeling full for a long period of time. I also have heartburn and acid reflux, but mostly at night. After every bowel movement I feel a burning and empty uncomfortable sensation in my stomach. It does not go away until a long period of time. The urgency to have a bowel movement wakes me up, and it also occurs during/after meals. I have diarrhea almost everyday. My bowel movements change every day and the texture and color of my stool does too. My stools are gassy, loose, watery, and smelly. I have also noticed that I have undigested food in my stools. Another symptom that worries me is a pain under my left chest/breast. This occurs at random times and I think it’s because of acid indigestion or gas? Furthermore, there has been two times when I experienced green vomit on an empty stomach. Could this have been bile? This was the most uncomfortable painful feeling. I went through it all day until my stomach finally decided to let it out. When I was 19 I had a colonoscopy done and they found hemorrhoids and inflammation, and mild gastritis. I am scheduled to see a GI doctor again in two months. I have tried my best to cope with these symptoms. I have changed my diet and I avoid trigger foods. When I look up my symptoms they relate to many digestive disorders that I do not know what it can be. This has caused me to have depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. I don’t even like to go out anywhere anymore. At this point this is interfering with my daily life and I hate it. Perhaps my anxiety correlates to these digestive symptoms.
Any comments, opinions, or suggestions would be helpful, thanks!

"I'm not sure what exactly GI issue is, but I can tell you that this is the very worst thing that I have had to deal with in exactly 9 years now. I say 9 years because this is the length of time that it has been ever since the very first time it totally embarrassed me in public - in a classroom setting. But I've suffered from this issue ever since childhood, and I'm 39 now. Not sure if your case was anywhere near as bad as mine is; I'm currently still dealing with the embarrassment, and it's getting worse - I fart loudly whenever I doze off, and it doesn't matter where I am. The only way I clue in to the occurrence of the embarrassing loud fart is from the unfriendly stares or jokes by people around me. The worst part of my ordeal is that it often happens at work, which is where I spend most of my time. I have been able to survive the stress it causes me because I have to work to survive, otherwise I would have quit my job the very first time it happened. By the way, the incident has repeated so many times that I have lost count.
Anyways, I'm not even sure exactly what my GI issue is (Crohn's, IBS, colitis, etc), but it is very bad. I strongly believe it is IBS because of my symptoms: frequent bloating, gas/fart, hyper and high-pitched bowel growling, unsteady appetite, irregular BM, occasional constipation. I've been on a one-a-day probiotic formular for a little less than two weeks now and I'm yet to see its full benefits. BM is more regular now, but that's it for now.
As it is, it's a difficult life to live with this issue causing me major embarrassments, robbing me of my self confidence, and ultimately taking a toll on my social life. I'd been to the doctor quite a few times in the past, the last time being about 2 years ago and ending up with a big medical bill. The worst part is that they couldn't figure out what was wrong with my GI. But I'm still suffering till this day. Could someone suggest something, please? This issue is ruining my life.

"Hi all I'm 46years old and I'm worried as to what's wrong with me . About 6 years ago I was regularly out on the town, I was in my early 40's and drinking quite heavily once or twice a week, then about 2 or 3 years ago I noticed that certain greasy foods were giving me quite severe stomach pains while I was eating them (Macdonalds , Kfc , burgers and kebabs , you get the idea, all the wholesome foods lol). I done nothing about it for ages then in June this year I visited my GP about it, who thought I was getting acid reflux and prescribed Lansoprazole but also sent me for blood tests and an abdominal Ultrasound. I didn't go along with acid reflux theory but none the less took the tablets. Then all of a sudden I started getting upper central chest pains front and back and lost my appetite, also I got an almost unrelenting left hand mid back pain, it was dull but noticeable.
I went away on holiday for five nights and hardly ate anything for 3 days, then when I did eat I ended up with very pale stools then severe diarrhea followed by heavy amounts of mucus . My pooh also had a chemical smell about it, it's a smell I've smelt before but can't name it. Anyway after diarrhea which lasted for the best part of 5 days it stopped with Imodium. However from that point on I'd get diarrhea once or twice a week and my stools would keep changing colour, from normal brown to very pale, sometimes both in one sitting. Sometimes pale floater and normal sinkers in one sitting. Also I have this bitter taste in my mouth (from time to time) and my pee changes colour a lot from almost clear to darker shade of yellow.
I've had full blood tests twice both of which come back normal, also an abdominal ultrasound revealed nothing . In fact the only test I've failed was elevated faecal Calprotectin (bowel inflammation). I lost a fair amount of weight initially but it has stabilised now and I have some of my appetite back too. Now in the back of my mind going back a couple of years I had the possibility that the stomach pains with greasy food could be Pancreatic Cancer, More recently too the other symptoms also have an element of Pancreatic Cancer (mainly thanks to Google). However my GP says it's highly unlikely as I haven't got typical symptoms , and I'm too young , she has referred me to G.I.
Hmmm I'm not too sure , believe me I don't want it, but it seems a bit of a coincidence that both my Long term problem and recent symptoms have PC in common. My liver function test is good , no sign of diabetes or jaundice . I stopped the lansoprazole a couple of weeks ago but I'm on betablockers and antidepressants for the anxiety, personally I'd rather have an earlier G.I appointment but unfortunately the tablets will have to do until then. Can anyone cast any light one way or other please, it's driving me insane with worry . Thanks Jim

"I'm a female, 16 and since a month ago, my stomach has been cramping and emitting loud, gurgling noises and I have been constipated. At first I thought it was because I was on my period and the amount of milk and diary products I was eating were causing me to cramp so I stopped eating them. This solved the problem for a while and when I started eating them again, everything was fine. Until the end of last month when I experienced a great deal of stress, it started up again but it was worse this time. Mum said it was stress and I believed her until I was no longer stressed and it didn't show any signs of letting up. Today is the only day where I haven't suffered due to the cramps. However, I did poo and I found that there were orange lumps and white mucus. Is this IBS or should I be worried? I haven't been to the gp as I'm too embarrassed and scared he will say something is wrong with me.

"Hi guys,
I've had a number of stomach problems since having a large ovarian cyst and my ovary removed a year ago. I've been diagnosed with IBS and I'm taking mebeverine. I also have acid reflus and dizziness due to low iron.
My question is, how does your IBS make you feel? I seem to have discomfort and bloating most days and have flare ups where I feel incredibley sick with frequent loose stools along with just a general feeling of groginess, tiredness and feeling unwell.
If you do have flare ups, how often do you feel unwell?
I'm suffering from quite a bit of anxiety and I feel like there is something that is being missed. I would just like reassurance and to hear some of your stories if that's okay

"Let me just summarize with I've worked myself into a panic over this. Its 2am, I can't sleep, and I'm incredibly anxious + even more stressed than I was.
For the past week since my wellness check and vaccines, I haven't had a 'normal' BM. If I go at all, they're pellet sized and only one or two each time. Just now I noticed a  weird sticky orange substance in it, though I wouldn't say it's gel like. It's like a bright orange--and I don't remember eating fish or anything like that. I've barely been eating at all.
I've had sharp stomach pains and pain in my lower back near my kidneys for about this same time frame. Most have equated it to anxiety. I'm drinking a lot of water but I can't eat because I constantly have this full feeling from my abdomen to my chest. I've been exercising more the past three days. Much more than I have in the past few months at that. I've stopped taking my daily vitamin too, as of late. (Like a month ago)
I'm so so so so afraid this is cancer or something that's going to kill me! I'm only 16, I don't wanna die. Please help???

"Hi,
I'm a 26 year old female and my doctor has recently diagnosed me with IBS, but I'm not sure if it is?
3 weeks ago I suffered a case of diarrhoea, had to go to the bathroom 3 times but generally didn't feel ill or anything. Since then I've not felt right. I haven't had diarrhoea since but my bowel habits haven't returned to normal, sometimes I feel I need to go quite a few times a day (I don't always end up going) and other days I'm absolutely fine and feel normal, it seems to come and go (this is just in 3 weeks). When it's a bad day I feel really sick as well (not actually been sick) and get a bellyache, nothing extremely painful, but uncomfortable.
The first time I went to the doctor she said it was likely gastroenteritis but the second doctor thought IBS? I could understand if I'd had a severe case of gastro and was still feeling the effects but it wasn't even that bad?
So is this likely to still be the effects of gastro or the start of IBS?
Also, I suffer a lot with stress and anxiety, have done for about 3 years but am currently going to CBT.

"Hello,
?I'm a new member and I would welcome any help you can give me. I was born with an imperforate anus and had  reconstructive surgery as a baby. I've suffered from constipation all my life (I'm 69 now) which has worsened over the years. I've been diagnosed with slow transit constipation and I'm taking linaclotide on prescription. This doesn't ""work"" by itself so I combine it with 25 - 30 mg Dulcolax pico liquid and sometimes with 5 - 10 Dulcoease stool softeners as well.
Every second or third evening I take one 290 micrograms linaclotide tablet straight after dinner and the pico liquid about 2 hours later. This usually results in diarrhoea in the middle of the night which is very debilitating but at least something is happening. However, I'm writing this at 1am and nothing has happened and it's very frightening. I can't dispel the thought that my system has stopped completely and I'll never go again.
?These thoughts are always at the back of my mind and they surface at times like now. Already I'm fretting that tomorrow I'll have to take yet more stuff and what if that doesn't work etc .
I'm really not sure how long I can go on like this. It's controlling my life and I can never go away from home except an occasional overnight stay. Is  there any natural remedy for slow transit constipation I can try as I'm almost at the end of my tether. Any help would be much appreciated.
Thank you and all the best to everyone.

The doctors gave me Mebeverine to try but it isnt making me any worse or any better. I took it with the hope the side affect would clog me up, but no such success.

"I have recently been diagnosed with IBS. (no tests other than a stool sample). But i also suffer from severe aniexty disorder and have done for years. The doctors think the stress i suffer from has induced this horrible condition.
My aniextys roll around my health mainly. So im finding this new change at increasingly diffiicult to manage and whats worse, im not sure if my symptoms are normal for IBS or not.
It tends to flare up when i am more nervous/ on my own and not doing anything. If im busy and out i seem fine (touch wood). I suffer from loose stool, at times i have a number of BM a day. When this dies down i will go days with no BM at all. (not constipation) Then it will flare again. This period of time with nothing sends me into a paranoid state as i dont like leaving the house when i have a flare up. So far the only food i can pinpoint a reaction from is mints and nerves. Any other food and when im positive i seem ok.
I beg for a period where i can go back to normal. Just for a time as doing research it says symptoms will die down. But when? This has been going on a few weeks now. The doctors are useless. They gave me Mebeverine which i have just started today to see if it helps. (fingers crossed) But other than that told me to just leave it till it settles. Easier said than done though.

"Im 20 years old and just been diagnosed with IBS D. Compared to some of the stories on here i don't have it nearly as bad and am considered a minor sufferer.
However i suffer from Generalized Aniexty Disorder and have just been through / still going through (and will be for a while) a very stressful experience. And my symptoms last for days with little to no relief. The pariona and stress is making this 10x worse. It reduces me to tears at times as i feel unable to live my life and work etc.
I am on medication for my aniexty which has just been raised. Although i suffer daily from it anyway. The doctor Diagnosed me with IBS D with no tests. He gave me a sample kit which i have just sent back. But other than that he just linked the stress and aniexty to my symptoms.
I suffer from loose BM for days sometimes over a week on end. I have only had one very minor stomach pain and dont seem to suffer from any of the other factors in IBS i,e bloating etc. I know this may seem like the easy option for some of the suffers but for me its still very diffiicult to deal with and has rendered me housebound (unless doctors appointments) for nearly a month. I dont want to eat anything as i have read all about the food triggers. But am still drinking plenty.
The doctor prescribed me Mebeverine Hydrochloride 135mg Tablets for the loose BM. (wont affect any of my other tablets) And said i can take them regulary or just when i suffer (it would be regular with me anyway)
BUT i have read all these horrible stories about it and im now to frightened to try it for fear of making it worse!! How does it help anybody else? Especially with IBS D as i know alot of people with IBS C don't bode with it well. Does anybody have any good feedback (or bad) for this drug?
I need some relief from this condition. So any feedback will be very welcomed. Thankyou!

"Hi all, my mother suffers really badly with IBS and it seems to run in the family such as my cousins suffer with it too but on a much lesser scale. I never really noticed myself suffering with symptoms until I was around 19, I'm now 21 and while these symptoms aren't unbearable I do feel as though I have a dull ache in my very lower stomach most of the time now. Most of the time it goes away after I've been to the toilet but until then (which can be a number of hours) it's generally there. I try to not let it stop me getting out and doing things and most of my friends and work colleagues don't know that I suffer with it.
Just getting a bit sick of it lately and it's starting to get me down a little bit. I go on holiday on Thursday up coming and I'm worried that it's going to ruin my time. I know worrying doesn't help but I am quite a worrying person by nature.
In the past I've tried buscopan, mebervine, and peppermint oil tablets. I was on a long term course of antibiotics for acne which I have now came off to see if it would help however it's been a few weeks now and it doesn't feel like it has. I've been trying probiotics for the past 2 weeks but not sure that is helping either.
Can anyone make any recommendations? Or if not even just reassure me that it's not always going to be bad?

"Hello, I just have a question to you all who are suffering from IBS. I have been having IBS for almost 5 years now and the symptoms are getting worse. 5 years ago, I noticed that I had what you call it attacks almost every morning after breakfast. I would feel much better after the restroom use, but I would still have constant pain in my lower abdominal area(usually below umbilicus). The pain would not go away, it would just be there. ThE pain still exists to this day. The pain is not necessarily sharp, but it is still uncomfortable and affects my daily life. Two more symptoms I have are nausea and dizziness. I dont just necessarily have these symptoms when I am under attack (the time when I need to rush to restroom), I have them almost everyday 24/7. Theses symptoms get especially bad in the morning for some reason..
Long post short, do you suffer from nausea, constant abdominal pain and dizziness even when you are not in attack?

"So last year i woke up one morning and passed blood. Ive had diarrhea since. Prior to this my stools were perfect and bowel movemnts were just like any normal person. I began to massive stools. Fatty and light in looks (sorry for being so descriptive its gross) I went in for a colonoscopy, X-rays, gastroscopy and abdominal CAT scan and nothing was found. Ive now lost 6-8 kgs and the pain and cramping that goes along with it have ruined my life and basically left me stuck at home. I don't know what to do anymore. This has truly destroyed my life and changed everything. Ive been on probiotics, digestive enzymes, acid suppresants and none of them have left me better off than I was. It pains me so much because one day I was fine, not a single problem and the next day I was destroyed and have been since. Its becoming increasingly difficult on my mind as well. I was a hard working 23 year old and now i feel useless and powerless. Please if anyone knows anything or has had anything like this happen ANY advice or help would be massively appreciated.

"Hello everyone,
I was diagnosed with IBS just before Christmas last year and prescribed Mebeverine.  As GP said I shouldn't worry, it wasn't serious and she asked if I was an anxious person (I am on occasion and was whilst having this attack), my symptoms decreased quite a lot over Christmas and new year.  I knew what it was, so I must ahve relaxed a bit and the symptoms reduced.
Today however (after an extremely stresfull day) I did actually take my first tablet and found no difference in my symptoms, they did actually worsen for a short time, about 6 hours after I took the tablet.
I'm wondering if these tablets have to be taken for a while and regularly to have any effect?
I'll take another in the morning (as prescribed) and see how I go.
My main worry here is if these tablets don't work, is my stomach pain not IBS OR is it just that these particular tablets are not for me and gp needs to give me something else?
Thanks in advance,

"Hello, new here. I have had symptoms of IBS for several years, ended up in hospital a few times. Think it might be related to having a hysterectomy which has really messed up my body and I also have pelvic adhesions.
last year symptoms got really bad, ended up in hospital when I started to haemmorage from my urethra. Turned out I have a urethral prolapse and the straining caused me to bleed.
my IBS was C but has changed to D. I had a colonoscopy, was told it was challenging because of adhesions and looping but from what they could see all was normal. Could not get down last part of colon because of looping. Given IBS diagnosis and basically it was goodbye, go away and live with he it.
now this year it has gotten so much worse. I could live with the D but it is the agonising stomach pain and contractions that scare me. I end up screaming in pain, convinced i am dying or actually wishing I was. Had to be restrained by a relative once in the bathroom to stop me throwing myself out the window.
i also get severe sweating, icy cold water dripping off me sweating and shaking uncontrollably. When the episode passes I am unable to stand or walk properly afterwards because of severe hip and back pain and stomach is a dreadful constant ache. 
This is may sound weird but i always know when I am going to get an attack. My heart starts racing, I get palpitations and a feeling of dread and panic. It is like some sixth sense. I know that sounds crazy.
i am now struggling with severe depression, not just mild depression but the kind that is taking me down a path that I know there is not going to be a good outcome.
i have tried everything, lacto free, wheat free, fodmap, gluten free, probiotics, nothing has worked. Now I have reached the point where I am too scared to eat. In six weeks I have lost two stone in weight, gone from ten stone down to eight and I am still dropping. I am living on less than 700 calories a day, tin of soup, two rice crackers, one banana and a small packet of plain crisps and loads and loads of water. I eat the same everyday and the sight of a meal or food terrifies me.
i look at food and I just identify it with pain and wonder how much it will hurt me, the frustrating thing is my symptoms are still continuing. One family member even asked how I could possibly produce so much D when I am not eating. Weird thing is despite my food intake being so low and my fibre level virtually non existent when I am not having the D and pain my BM are normal and regular. Although after the D it can be a week or more before I go again.
i just don't know how long I can keep going on I am tired of being ill and confined to the house and waking up each day wondering how much pain I will be in and how many hours I will be camped out in the bathroom and lying on the floor. People are not sympathetic, oh try a bit of food it won't harm you, just try some, the pain can't be that bad, have you tried thinking positive, there is always someone worse off, you need to change your attitude, your exaggerating, you should try to do more. Heard them all and now I just cannot do this horrible IBS anymore. Doctor uninterested, don't see it as serious, gave me Spasmonal but they don't work, was on Mebeverine but they were useless. Refuse to take Imodium because if I stop the D the pain is even worse..

"Hi everyone,

"I have just been informed about this forum by a doctor and decided to share my experiences with IBS.
I'm a 31 year old professional, having a really hectic life style(always had). I used to be quite chubby (around 80 kilos) and 1.75 cm height. And used to eat any sort of food, alcohol + occasionally smoking.
Just over a year ago(2012), I have a severe wisdom teeth problem and before the extraction, I was offered to take several painkillers by my dentist (ibuprofen) since the pain was too much! Right after the removal and treatment (maybe a month), one day I had a horrible diarrhea following with mild cramps and had to rush to the emergency. When I was checked the doctors could not find anything important, and sent me home. The diarrhea and other symptoms disappeared but I started to have rapid bowel movements in the morning so decided to see my GP. My GP run several tests, including full blood profile, Stool, urine, H. Pylori but could not find anything and diagnosed with IBS. The problem was I started to lose weight during this period, even though my symptoms disappeared slowly.
I've changed my diet, as started to eat more vegetables, sea-food, fibers and NO junk-food!
Completely stopped drinking alcohol,cola or any other sugary drinks and stopped smoking for the time being.
Currently my weight is about 66 kilos, and my height is 1.75 cm. I have recently got a full-blood profile check and everything was normal but I was quite worried about my weight. I was told that due to the fact that, I have completely changed my diet (stopping alcohol, junk food and etc..) this might have caused a weight loss but my GP said, it's quite normal according to my BMI. For the time being, (about 18 months, ) I see this weight loss, more than 10 kilos a little bit too much!! (I do exercise more than I used to, walking + jogging 2-3 times a day)
I rarely get some IBS symptoms, like wanting to rush to toilet after a big meal and sometimes just not having a big appetite that I used to have. During this period, I never had any other symptoms or even a cold,flu, weird stools and etc...
Would really appreciate some feedback regarding to my weight loss and the diagnosis so far.
Thank you

"Hi! I'm new posting here and could use some help! I have terrible anxiety that rears its ugly head when things are stressful. Other times, I have anxiety, but my meds seem to keep it at bay. Last weekend I had a bad flare up and there was bright red blood on my toilet paper, which is not unusual. I didn't think anything of it, but the next day I had a little bit of darker blood (it was a tiny bit, probably dried from my thrombosed hemorrhoid). I haven't had any bleeding since then, but I fell into the rabbit hole of googling. I have a new daughter and I keep thinking I'm going to get a disease and die, leaving her behind. I have diagnosed myself with colon cancer, and I'm even taking on some of the symptoms, but most of me knows this is just my anxiety. I have frequent bowel movements, but I feel like it's a lot smaller in size than normal, and I still feel like there's something left when I finally finish up. I don't want to strain, but I feel like I need to. I've taken laxatives, fiber, stool softener, but it seems to stay the same. My stomach hurts, but I think that's from anxiety more than anything. I have never been diagnosed with ibs, but I have had symptoms for the past 10 years. So, I feel constipated, but I'm still pooping. Has anyone else had this happen? Advice?

"Hello all,
I suffer from post infectious IBS ( from a bout of food poisoning back in November 2015) and I have been reading on on people having amazing results from taking probiotic tablets. I just wanted to know if anyone on here has tried them and if so which one? I want to give them a go as for this condition is taking over my life and i feel like a prison in my own home. I dont suffer from D or C, just nast stomach pains after I go for a BM, and the feeling of incomplete evacuation which makes me feel like i need to go all the time. Although the only question I have is i dont know which probiotic I should start taking and how much (10 billion, 20 billion etc)

"Hi All,
Going through an episode of IBS attack for the last week. Apart from the usual abdominal pain I am having the need to rush to the toilet within 15mins of getting up. It starts with me breaking wind and within a minute I have to make an urgent dash to the bathroom. Any suggestions on how to help with this? My appetite has been almost non existent and I've lost a little weight due to this. I sometimes suffer late evening as well and starts exactly the same way, first I break wind and then the dash to the toilet is on. When I'm I fear the dreaded wind flatulance feeling because I know what follows.
Really appreciate any suggestions on this. It is a pain in the bum. Excuse the pun.
Thanks.

"I had colonoscopy and the specialist found out I have 5 ulcers in my big intestine but it is not cancer. May be I have Crohn,s diseases which later will develop become cancer if I dont treat it. Still waiting for confirmation of biosy which takes week to know. Frustration and scary. However, after the colonoscopy, my symptoms get worse. I feel I want to toilet after eating. I think the IBS is a signals of having ulcer in the big intestine. Has anyone got the same issue, Crohn diseases which started with IBS?

"Hi, I haven't posted for some time now. Think the last time I was waiting for an ultrasound. Well that came back all clear but was still getting the same symptoms. Burning, burping, pain under ribs and right side and also losing weight for fear of eating something that may trigger the symptoms. Thought I'd try something different and natural. I started taking strong probiotics on the morning and an aloe Vera tablet at night. Wow no heavy symptoms for four weeks apart from an occasional twinge that would last hour or so. I became a different person, happy with less anxiety eating more, exercising more and generally a nicer person to my wife and daughter. Now two days into a a terrible flare up for no reason whatsoever. Absolutely gutted. Trying to think what I ate but nothing different from the last few weeks. Fed up of going to doctors. Now I feel like I'm back to square one. Don't think this will ever go away.

"Was diagnosed with IBS about 1-1/2 years ago after having had some odd symptoms appear at the same time. First was kind of like a stitch on my left side that I felt for a few days, change in stool shape and color and worst of all intense anal spasm. The spasms don't come that often but they only happen in the middle of the night while I""m sleeping. They are extremely painful and take anywhere from a 1/2 hour to an hour to subside. Was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what have they found effective to help relieve the problem. My doctor gave me a prescription for Donnatal extended release tabs but they've been discontinued and to honest I don't think they really helped any way.

"So in Feb I was suffering with abdominal pretty much all day every day sometimes it'd be low down and sometimes higher up. Increase in gas and indigestion. Had blood tests which were normal and doctor put in down to IBS. Now saying this I hadn't had a change in bowel movements at all. Not diarrhoea nor constipation. Firstly I was just wondering if it is possible to have IBS with no bowel changes? Would appricate it if anyone could enlighten me on this please.
Now I had these pains everyday since February until beginning of May now they've gone I get the odd day of pain/cramping ? But not often and its not bad. But past 2 weeks been feeling slightly sick, a feeling a lightheadedness and slight dizziness. Also suffering from tiredness. Which doesn't improve with sleep or anything I was just wondering if these sound like IBS symtoms or not. I would google these symtoms but when my doctor suggested it could be IBS couple of months back I went googling mad and Ended up convinced I had colon or stomach cancer so I don't Google symtoms anymore. Anyway thamkyou for taking time to read this long winded post but any help would be hugely appreciated and thanks in advance

"I hope someone can help.... I'm at the end of my tether and I'm beyond worried.
This has been going on for months and I don't know what to do. I've just registered with a GP but there are no appointments for another 3 weeks and I'm not sure how much more I can deal with.
I can go days and days without going to the loo but I'll feel bloated. Then all of a sudden I'll need to go but when I do it's incredibly loose. Then I'll need to go everyday (loose every time) before the next bout of constipation....
I go every night at the same time.. Between 7 and bedtime. I eat breakfast and lunch everyday and I'm fine, then as soon as I have my dinner after work, I need to go instantly. I don't really have pain unless I need to go. I always eat home cooked food (not sure if that makes a difference).
I'm extra worried as last night right after going, I went to check to see if I could again and all I got was it mixed with mucus.
I'm so embarrassed but I'm also scared. Does this sound like it could be IBS? If so, how do I control it until I can see a doctor?
It's ruining my life! I avoid my BF touching me at bedtime incase something happens and I lose control. Please help!!!!!!

"Hi,
24yr old female. I have been suffering of or 12 months with abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, severe constipation to the point where I did not have a Bowel movement for 6 weeks and I have only just started going naturally. I recent had a colonoscopy which was clear so it's not IBD at the moment. I had a barium follow through meal X-ray in April and I got my results today. It says that there are abnormalities 5cms long in my small bowel terminal ileum. My doctors have said it is looking to be more of a severe form of IBS. I did start off with 3 months of constant watery stools but now they are did full to pass and have been since January.
Is there anyone that could help me or point me in the right direction as to whether or not you can lose weight with this... I have tried everything and I just maintain weight even when I was on slimming world I just cannot seem to lose a pound like I use to be able to. I have tried mabeverin, buscapan, colofac, clean eating, high fat foods, high fibre foods. I look like I am about to give birth to twins with how swollen my tummy goes. Out of experience what do people try to avoid when eating healthy and what do people try to eat. I know everyone is different but the only think that doesn't effect me with pain is Chicken nuggets or ice pops but I can't live on them realistically! I need to lose weight but I have been told by several people that inflammation of the Bowel lining and IBS and being b12 deficient is going to be impossible and I can't look the way I am.

"I've not actually had an official diagnosis of IBS but GP suggests this is what I might have. It started in December with pain under my left rib, no tummy troubles but in January the pain switched to right sided pain. I have days of aches under right rib, near my appendix and in my lower right pelvis, some days the pain is def gas pains, others it's period type pain. I'm suffering off and on with constipation and after a heavier meal episodes of diarrhea, with the constipation I have episodes of quite bad muscous and wind. I'm also getting mild heartburn.
I have had a pelvic and abdominal ultrasound which were both clear and GP seems to think thats me done in terms of diagnostics. Over the past couple of weeks the abdominal pain has been waking me at night and I'm uncomfortable lying on either side. Does any of this sound like IBS or should I be insisting on more tests, endoscopy/colonoscopy. I think the GP is sick of seeing me! I'm female, 36 and otherwise in good health.

"im hoping at least someone will see this and can relate and help me in some way! Im getting slightly desperate as I feel like ive gone as far as i can go with the doctors, they just dont seem to understand this part enough or maybe dont have enough sympathy or understanding. 
Okay here goes, ive been ""diagnosed"" with IBS. I get a lot of diarhhoea and constipation as well as wind. Every morning without fail i get trapped wind, some mornings it's just a little that seems to pass quite quickly, other times i can be bent over in agony pacing round my living room for a good half hour, sweating and feeling sick, before i can get it out! I then feel a bit sluggish for the rest of the day. Most people's IBS i read about seems to be affected by food and this is where mine differs as through keeping note i have found that no matter what i eat or how stressed i am i cant seem to control it there is no pattern! having tried many other anti-spasmodics i concluded nothing works for me. 
I want a colonoscopy but my doc is reluctant as I had one 4 years ago but I'm still having problems so surely they need to go back in again. They can't assume by just looking at me. 
Can anyone throw any light on this please ?

"For almost two years now I've had an upset stomach, a constant what I would describe as a 'dull' pain in my lower stomach. When I go to the toilet there is what I believe to be called mucus, like jelly stuff and most recently I have noticed blood but that was two weeks ago now. My bowel movements are very irregular from 4 times a day to maybe 4 times a week. 
- Sensation of feeling sick (never been sick)
- No weight loss 
- No appetite 
- No acid
I've had tests and a camera down my throat into my stomach and nothing was found. The pain I experience is moderate, I can handle it but sometimes it does become severe. I've been to see a specialist and was tested for H-Pylori and did a barium swallow and all was well there.

"I'm male, 17 years old and I'm in my last year of studying in my local sixth form. This is the first post I've done but I really need help because my life is a misery. I've had strange bowel movements for 5-6 years now but in the last couple years it's got significantly worse. It started when I was doing my GCSE exams when I as 15 and I one exam I had the sudden urge to use the toilet. As you can imagine this was quite stressful for me because I knew what was coming but I couldn't do anything to stop it. I eventually got to the toilet but I couldn't continue with my exam due to the severity of my diarrhea. This continued throughout my exams and I started to develop a severe anxiety problem. I had to do the remainder of my exams in a seperate room and sitting in a room for 2 hours with no distractions to take your mind off needing the toilet was very very difficult. Since then I've had my ups and downs. I've been to the doctors and was prescribed loperamide (which I take 3-4 each day) and saw a specialist but they thought it was the anxiety triggering it. I knew for a fact it wasn't but I couldn't challenge his judgement. I was sort of cast aside by the NHS after that. I had to give up playing rugby and my place in an academy rugby team which was awful for me but I couldn't even go to training because of my combination of diarrhea and anxiety. I also ran out of an airport when I was due to go on holiday because I couldn't face the flight. There are a long list of things I have missed out on which make me feel awful.
These days I struggle going to school. Even my 40 minute bus journey is difficult to do without needing to go. I miss lessons frequently which has had a big impact on my education and grades. I'm supposed to be going to university next year but I'm scared I won't be able to cope with my IBS (although I haven't been diagnosed). I just don't know where to turn too next.
I struggle going out the house in all honesty, I've had to quit my job after a series of shifts where I just couldn't stay. I pass loose stools at least 4-5 times per day but I get the urge to go much more frequently than that. My anxiety isn't as bad as it was but my stomach is just the same. It's ruining my life and I feel so down and low. It's very embarrassing for me and only a few people know the true nature of my problem. I just need advice and help on how to overcome and manage this problem because I honestly don't know how long I can put up with this for.
Thanks in advance.

"I have had IBS most of my life, mostly it was just a nuisance.  I would go back and forth between constipation or frequent loose bowel movements with cramping if I ate too much fiber. (I seem to be more sensitive to fiber then most people.) I controled these bouts with immodium but tried not to over use it.  Less then a week ago I came off antibiotics from a first ever divirticulitis attack.  I am okay now... no fever no sharp pains but I had a bad reaction to the strong antibiotics and it made my ribs feel like they were being pulled apart.  They feel better but still hurt a bit although not like before. In the last few days I have tried to slowly add fiber into my diet but it has been tough.  I seem to be unable to get a middle ground.  I am either a little constipated or I am having 5-7 loose (not diahrea) bowel movements with cramping, over the space of two or three hours; usually in the morning.  I have found out I cannot tolerate prunes or prune juice as in the days I have the problem the worst it hits two to three hours after having prunes in some form.  After getting off the prunes I tried just one serving of Citricel the next day, a third of a raw apple at lunch along with a whole wheat sandwich (nothing greasy or spicy). I also had some grapes in the evening and seemed to be okay, but a very tiny bit plugged just the next morning.  Next day I ate the same pretty much but added 8 oz of apple juice with the Citricel in the morning.  Did this for two days and each day after it was like I had done prune juice again.  After two to three hours of not being able to get too far from a bathroom I am left feeling bloated and gassy for the rest of the day. I am also lactose intolerant so take lactaid.  Could I also be Sorbitol intolerant?  How can I find out?  I just am guessing here... I just don't know what to do.

"Hi All
I'm looking for some information and advice regarding my IBS symptoms, prior to my next dietician appointment, and was hoping some of you fellow IBS sufferers may be able to help me.
I'm led to believe that frequent urgent bowel movements, triggered by suspect foods, are a major symptom of IBS. Is this correct? I ask as I only usually have one bowel movement a day (maybe 2 now and again), and it always happens when I wake up from my nights sleep. I never experience eating a food, then having a reaction that needs me to get to the toilet fast.
If there are any other IBS sufferers that don't seem to get the urgent bowel movements, then I would be very grateful to hear from you.
Many thanks in advance.

"Hi, I'm a 24 year old female and have been suffering from severe bowel problems for about 7 months ago.
Firstly: June 15 I was diagnosed with a neurological problem that subsequently left me unable to pass water on my own, I was fitted with an indwelling catheter. Due this foreign body I ended up having constant kidney/bladder infections, I'd say I was on antibiotics continuously for 4 months.
Sept 15 I fell seriously ill with sickness & diarrhoea, 15-20 bouts per day, blood and mucous in the stool, terrible tummy aches etc. I knew there was something up but everytime I went to my GP they would just say it was only a bug and to go home and rest. 3 weeks went by and I had stop eating, struggled to sleep more than an hour at a time and was getting worse, I tried going out for some fresh air but I passed out and my partner had to phone an ambulance for me. I was put on drips due to dehydration and low potassium but again no stool cultures were taken. 7 weeks go by, I've lost just under 2 stone in weight and was rushed back up to A&E with severe tummy pains, they finally done stool tests and it came back positive for cdiff (clostridium difficile) I was put on vancomycin for 3 weeks but then relapsed again Jan 16 so was put on flagyl for a further 2 weeks.
However my digestive system has never been the same, my Dr initially said it was IBS, but shes not sure anymore due to the amount of diarrhoea I'm having. My symptoms are:
ANY food triggers an onset of diarrhoea within half an hour of eating. This could be a nibble of something or a full meal, makes no difference.
I have about 5-7 bouts of diarrhoea per day
Bad tummy pains
I also have a dragging like feeling as if I can feel food/stool move through my body (that's what it feels like to me anyway)
Blood and mucous in my stool, everytime.
My symptoms are worse in the morning and afternoon, I'd say my stomach begins to settle around 5-6pm
I get dizzy but in my opinion that's due to me not eating enough, it's a vicious cycle though!
I can't focus when I'm like this, I can't work, I can't continue with my education, I just need to find something that's going to help. I've tried lots of different anti diarrhoeal medicines, none of them make any difference. Do you think my symptoms add up to a diagnosis of IBS? Or do you think the cdiff has caused lasting damage?
My next term starts in august and I'm really wanting to go back (I had to drop out bc of this) I of course want a proper diagnosis but for now I just want something to help me be normal again.
I'm going for an XRAY today as I had tracers put in my body and this will show the transit time and if there is a blockage anywhere, I'm also due to go for a sigmoidoscopy in a couple of weeks.
Thanks for listening x

"For the last 6 months or more I've been suffering from a very gassy disgestive system and bloating of the stomach. I've also had diarrohea on and off for several years. The gas is the most embarassing and worst aspect as it makes terrible rumbling noises which has caused me to become very self-concious. The noises don't stem from hunger but from gas passing through. The noises generally start in the 15 minutes after/during eating and continue one and off for several hours.
I've tried Beano, antacids, as well as Mebeverine from my doctor but to no avail. The only thing that works to relieve the gas symptoms is activated charcol tablets. My Doctor thinks it's IBS but it was a fairly quick diagnosis with no tests. My question is does this definitively sound like IBS? And also, what treatments are there that have worked for people?

"Reading your discussion leads me to tell my story. At eight I found I was constipated a lot of the time. Everyone said eat more ruffage however due to my life being effected I put myself on laxitatives and  despite my GP warning me I was doing myself harm I took them through to forty. This did'nt cure my problem but helped me cope. My family history is full of like ailments. My Father passed away with bowel cancer having had one ressection operation and survived till Eighty-five. I was advised to have colonoscopy every four years. I had an illergic reaction to one of these ended up with admission to hospital suspected appendicitis which calmed down so was released. I have had recurrent pain/throbbing in my right groin no obvious apendercitis despite ultrasound. I have had recurrent pneumonia blood test have indicated autoimmune disease I need to have a CT scan which I have not  done as yet.
I think the body responds in all sorts of ways to external situations. Look at life style/stress. Eat only fresh foods and cut out anything immediately if cause any symptoms. Find an activity you can totally switch off to.

"Hi All
I had quite a bad experience over the weekend and was hoping someone might be able to give me their views and advice concerning this. I'll explain what happened.
On Sunday, I felt pretty rough all day with the usual IBS symptoms that I have been accustomed to since being diagnosed with IBS over a year ago. I rode the day out, as I normally do, thinking nothing of it other than 'here we go again'. I woke on Monday feeling a lot better, as is typical with my IBS going from feeling groggy one day and fine the next. Still felt fine for most of the day, until around 7pm that evening when everything changed. It started by having a hot, pressure type flush feeling rise up through my body from my lower abdomen to my head. Next thing was my skin felt really hot to touch, I started sweating and felt clammy all over. Then I started to shake uncontrollably and violently all over, and no matter what I did I could not control it. At the same time I started feeling hot one minute, and cold the next, then back to feeling hot and visa versa. This went on for about an hour and a half and wouldn't stop. By this time I was starting to get quite worried, and my partner and I were wondering if we should call emergency services. I would like to point out that during this episode, I had no other problems, other than feeling a bit of nausea and some mild discomfort around my upper and lower abdomen, certainly didn't pass out or loose conscienceness (? spelling). I had checked my blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels and temperature and all were fine. My brother popped in to say hello, as family do, and as soon as he saw the state of me he phoned for an ambulance. It was like I was having a fit, yet was totally aware of what was going on. We waited for about an hour and a half for an ambulance, by that time the shaking had stopped but I was still struggling to control my temperature, even though my core temperature was normal. The paramedics checked me out, even put me on an ECG, and everything was fine, so said there was no point in going to hospital, but told me to see my GP the next day. By the time they left it was about 11pm, so I went straight to bed.
Woke the next day and my shaking had turned into slight shivering, I was feeling hot to touch, but cold inside, with the usual IBS pains and nausea. Got an appointment to see my GP, who gave me a good check over, and he was very thorough, even making sure my blood pressure stayed the same whilst sitting down and standing up. When he checked my skin he noticed red bloches over my abdomen and back that returned when pressed and immediately said these were heat rashes being caused by a infection, probably viral. He organised an urgent blood test and urine test to be done, which samples of both were taken that morning, and according to the nurse I should have results for if not this afternoon, by tomorrow at the latest. My GP said whilst treating me that this was nothing to do with my IBS, and was a seperate issue, however I am not so convinced, and the reason I wanted to start this discussion and ask others for advice and any info they might have.
I have had a number of infections since all my problems started almost 2 years ago, with this latest one being the worst so far. Can anyone tell me if it is normal for IBS sufferers to keep getting infections, or whether these infections I get are totally unrelated? I'm pretty sure the infections are gut related, my kidneys seem fine, no probs passing urine, no cough or cold or any other symptoms that could indicate infection anywhere else in my body. No one else in the family is having any problems with infections, so couldn't have caught it through them. I'm also trained in hygiene and food safety, and I put these practises in place daily. I know that being run down makes you more susceptible to picking up viruses, and my diet is pretty poor due to my inability to eat a lot of nutrient giving foods.
Any help, advice or views anyone has regading this would be greatly appreciated, especially if you get reoccurring infections for no apparent reason. Just want to add that before my problems started almost 2 years ago, my partner used to call me unbreakable as I would never seem to catch any colds or bugs or illnesses, or if I did I would get over them in half the time, if not less, than it did for my partner and kids to get over. All those years growing up on farms have probably given me quite a strong immune system.
Many thanks in advance for any help or advice you can give.

"Hi, I'm at a bit of a loss with these symptoms. I generally feel absolutely fine... I was on holiday at the end of January and since then on and off I've been having a few issues with passing stools. Sometimes very soft and fluffy almost, sometimes pencil like, occasional diarrhoea and also normal. Every one to two weeks I experience discomfort in my lower abdomen. The discomfort is almost like a cramping feeling, but I don't have pain, just a tender feeling. I feel like it could be IBS.... I have been under some stress recently, from what I've been reading IBS can be related to that too? Any help or advise greatly appreciated.

"Hello. I'm a 23 y/o female, slim build and relatively healthy. I eat well, plenty fruit and veg and drink enough water (1-2 litres a day). 
For about the past 7/8 weeks I've been bloated everyday. It gets better and worse but it is CONSTANT, even a bit when I wake up. It is very uncomfortable at times, and I'm so self conscious.
I have no abdominal pain but feel that I may be slightly more gassy too. I went to the docs and had blood tests that ruled out coeliac disease and she said IBS is unlikely as I have no pain. Also was worried about ovarian cancer but she said she isn't concerned because there of my age.
what could this be ??  And are there any tablets or probiotics that can help me?  I've tried a 7 day flat stomach sachets which made no difference at all.

"For about a few days I have been suffering constipation. Like I have the need to go but I either cant or go a little. I noticed white specks on my stool which I think it can be a sign of a parasite. I highly doubt it can be something like colon cancer because then is feel a sharp pain on my colon area along with the right side of the hip my stool would be in some shade of dark red or something. I dont feel like I have nausea neither do I have tiredness. Im not vomiting either. Or have food sickness. I had oatmeal plus an orange and apple sauce today morning (so good) I noticed I lost weight although it doesn't really physically show. Yesterday I was very hungry and had a teriyaki bowl at night. Other than that I feel like the need to go but I cant or when I do I feel like I didn't go all the way.

"Hi Guys
Over the last few years I've had nearly all the symptons that people post regularly on here for IBS, except needing the loo desperately! Over the last 3 months I have been on the fodmap diet, and stick to it most of the time, its helped massively however when I go to bed and try to lay on my left side, after a couple of minutes I feel uncomfortable, my stomach rumbles, I break wind, I sometimes get a sickly feeling and my stomach on that side feels quite hard. sometimes if i'm laying on my back and I turn my head to the left I also feel the same. Does anyone else experience these symptons, would really appreciate any feedback or suggestions as I have never heard of anyone who has had the same, thanks to everyone in advance.

"Hi Guys,
To make it easier, I will just list my timeline of events/symptoms in bullet form. It'd be great to hear if anyone else has experienced similar symptoms to know if it will just pass or if I should seek further medical advice.
5 years ago I became extremely stressed and experienced anxiety attacks due to a life changing event. Gut has never been the same again since then (generally ok, but seemed more sensitive to foods like gluten and sugary carbonated drinks causing bloating/discomfort and tiredness).
Recently moved house which was quite stressful. Then all of a sudden one night after eating pasta (gluten...normally I would eat gluten free pasta) my stomach just went into chaos where I had to constantly go to the bathroom (formed not watery...but seemed constant...was quite scary). Then I experienced shivers, headaches, lethargy and generally worn out all the time for several weeks after that event (felt like I was being poisoned).
Went to the doctor and he ordered blood test/samples and it came back positive for parasites (dientamoeba/camphylobater) so he put me on strong antibitoics. Negative to coeliacs.
Fast forward a month (to the present) and still whenever I have anything in my gut/bowel I feel like I need to get it out otherwise it tends to cause inflamation (headachy, causes me to get emotional/depressed, dizziness, nausea, lethargy). However, once completely cleared from my gut, I begin to feel 'normal' again!
Could this be IBS? do you think it will pass?
My doctor asked if I wished to have an edoscopy. However, as I am trying to restore my gut's balance I didn't wish to go down that road just yet.  What do you think?! do you need to be in pain to have IBS? any advice or suggestions from someone that has/had similar symptoms that will be greatly appreciated.

"So it all started roughly 3 weeks ago where suddenly one day I was getting really bad stomach cramps, bloating, a lot of gas especially after eating (my stomach would literally rumble all the time, eating or not eating), had very little appetite. Went to the doctors a few days later and they said I had a stomach infection, I wasn't having diarrhea or vomiting at the time.
I started to worry a lot during the next week or so as I suffer from pretty bad anxiety and the symptoms weren't changing at all. I lost about a stone of weight in a week and a half which I assume was down to not eating  (I could only manage a few bananas a day) 
About a week and a half later my stomach cramps seemed to stop and a pain developed just under my right set of ribs, which seemed to get worse and worse as the days went by. I started to get really loose BMs of a weird greeny dark orange colour which seemed to reduce the pain and would find myself going 2/3 a day and not feel empty after the first. I find myself needing to urinate a lot more frequently too, maybe cause I'm drinking a load of water? 
I went to the doctors a few more times and got shrugged off saying it was all down to my anxiety which was causing the issues?
Finally I got to see a good doctor who gave me a blood test which came back with nothing and said I had IBS which was developed as a post-infection mixed with my anxiety levels. I kept asking if any other tests were required and he kept saying there is no point. 
Now I usually have a constant pain under my right ribcage, which comes and goes through the day, usually worse after eating, sometimes under my left ribcage is a feint pain too and sometimes it'll rise into upper abdomen, where I'll get what I assume is heartburn? A weird burning sensation behind  my left, sometimes right breastplate, is that what heartburn is like? I have no idea. I have a very small appetite. 
I'm still getting the bloating, a lot of gassiness especially after eating and slmetimes getting these weird pains in my lower and upper back. I'm also these getting random twitches and aches round my body at times. Including a weird stinging pain sometimes in my neck. I've  had a Swishing in one ear for a while which the doc has guaranteed is due to a lot of wax build up so I'm taking ear drops for that which aren't doing anything.

"Redness (blood) around stools but not turning stool red nor black. Blood on toilet roll as I wipe. Its not a tiny bit a minute cut would cause, there's enough to visibally see blood around stools in water and also enough on the toilet paper for me to start asking questions. It's happened 3 times in the last 40 days lasting around a week each time.
A warmth / stinginess while passing but only small stool; not runny nor hard - inbetween. 
After passing it feels like air in my stomach or a full emptiness sensation with the false sensation of needing the toilet again. 
I also sometimes get very sudden onset of pain in the front right side to stomach area which gets worse with any movement but subsides after a a few minutes. There's no other discomfort apart from that.
Part of my thinks it's just a cut from pushing or something but I've not had to push, my bowel movements have been normally; not runny or rock solid and not thick stools either.

"My story started over a year a go when I had my first 'funny turn' which has now turned into intermittent episodes of the same symptoms. I start to feel nauseous, dry heave, have to run to the bathroom urgently and usually have diarrhea. I will then start shaking violently. I will have several more bouts of diarrhea until the nausea passes and I feel exhausted. I will generally then be off my food for days. My stools also look a bit narrow in these times. Having a very quick metabolism, this is not great as I do drop some weight. Since the first of these episodes I have had a fair few more with them lasting anywhere from an hour to me feeling this way for up to a week. Since the first episode my bowel habits have never been quite normal, though they do return pretty close to normal, though I now have a tendency towards some constipation. Stools return to a normal diameter also.
I generally have no pain, though do sometimes get gas pain. I sometimes get pelvic pain unlinked to these episodes that feel like mild period pain. I also did have some discomfort in my lower right side but this has pretty much resolved, though I feel it occassionally. I also get a lump in throat sensation which has been diagnosed as globus. No visible blood in stool and stool looks a healthy colour.
I have had a ton of tests (some whilst symptomatic) but all of them have been totally utterly normal:
General blood work
Celiac blood test
Throid function blood test
H Pylori blood test
Calprotectin stool test
Abdominal ultra sound carried out by a specialist doctor
2x pelvic ultrasounds
Flexible sigmoidoscopy carried out by CR surgeon - this showed visible inflamation throughout the procedure but all biopsies were normal so the inflamation was put down to the enema before the procedure
Endoscopy - no biopsies taken which I was annoyed about but the procedure was carried out by an experienced Dr who said there were simply no abnormalities to be seen.
I am awaiting a colonoscopy because I insisted. I was put on omeprazole 6 months ago and I feel this helped my symptoms and my episodes were less and if they did crop up more short lived but I had to discontinue this for the endoscopy last week. I have had a flare this week and am feeling rubbish. No appetite at all.
My partner was rushed into hospital a month ago and I had my first episode in a while the day after, so part of my thinks it could be stress. An episode is also more likely to come on with my period, so that makes me think hormonal. I have tracked food for months and seen a dietician and done low fodmap strictly and identified no triggers for these episodes, but realised I am a bit sensitive to some vegetables which I now avoid.
My GI consultant insists this is IBS, but the episodes I have just sound so odd when I read other stories here. Also the lack of pain. I am desparate for answers and am having a hard time accepting the IBS diagnosis. I am meant to ve moving (alone) to the US for work later this year for several months and I need answers and a management plan before I go. I feel like I am going mad. My partner says I should just accept the diagnosis...
Does anyone's syptoms match these? I know there is no one size fits all, but these seem unusual for IBS. I am 30. No history of bowel cancer or IBD in the family.
Thanks in advance.

"Hello
After having awful diarrhea while taking antibiotics 3 months ago, I still have loose poops maybe once or twice a day.
Ive been tested for CDiff and bacteria - all negative.
I had a Calprotecin test and it came back at 35, so my GP has diagnosed me with IBS.
Im 43 and feel Im a little to old to have IBS.
All sorts of bad thoughts are going through my head and Ive become totally obsessed with the toilet!
No matter what time I get up, whether it be around 730 for the school run or if I have a lie in at the weekend and get up at 10, after about an hour I need the toilet.  I can almost feel my bowel wake up soon after I do!
My GP has been very kind to me and has referred me to the gastro department but this could take weeks.  My anxiety is sky high and is affected my family and me greatly.
I did have a heart test a couple of months ago and the medicine they gave me, gave me watery diarrhea.  I also find that alcohol goves me looser poops now too.
Can anyone advise?

"I'm a 24-year old guy. About two months ago, I noticed my stools started to be really loose. It's definitely not diarrhea, and when it's coming out, it feels like a solid, normal bowel movement, but it's always loose and unformed when I look in the bowl. This is consistent and not a thing that only happens sometimes
I have no other symptoms besides this. No pain, no bloating, no visible bleeding or anything. I go about once a day, maybe once every other day, which is my usual. I'm not constipated and I don't have diarrhea.
I haven't changed my diet either. Adding fiber to my diet causes the problem to go away, but I'm confused why I suddenly need the extra fiber when I'm certain I haven't changed my diet at all.
About two months ago, around the time this started happening, I had a case of mild food poisoning after eating some bad chili. I didn't throw up, but just had really sudden, really bad diarrhea. My question is: could that have caused my gut flora to go out of whack? I tried a daily probiotic for a couple of days but it didn't do anything for me. And I figured I'd have more symptoms if this was the case, but as I said before, I have no other symptoms except that my bowel movements (which haven't changed in frequency) are suddenly just loose/unformed...
Is this maybe IBS, even when this is the only symptom? I'm trying probiotic acidophilus and will give it a go for a couple of weeks, but the loose stool is really freaking me out!

"Hello- I posted on here a few weeks ago and everyone was so lovely and helpful. I'm 18 years old and am being investigated for IBS originally it was for diarrhea type as I would get really bad pain and need the toilet. But now after having weeks of loose stools and no normal ones- now find myself constipated ad I don't know what to I've been drinking endless amounts of water, eating healthy. Is it normal to have alternating diarreah and constipation with IBS I feel like I Physically can't go to the toilet like it's blocked (sorry for info) I am just finishing up with exams and my doctor keeps saying it is stress for the reason I haven't had a normal bowel movement in so long but something at the back of my head tells me it's something worse. I have also been checking for blood and on a few occasions I can see bright red soy stool but I don't know if it is blood or if it's tomatoes or pepper I'm seeing- I do think I suffer from anxiety as every month I seem to worry about something with my health and it's so hard to control my mum doesn't understand she has just recovered from cervical cancer so anything to her isn't as serious as what she went through so she doesn't listen to me and just shuts me off. I am so worried about my tummy problems and it's really getting me down I just want to be able to go to the toilet normally. Also is bad back normal with ibs? If anyone has any help or advice or medications I can take for my weird alternating ibs then please let me know I'd be so great full. Thankyou Maisie xx

my stool habits have definitely changed. The first week I was having trouble going at all- passing small pellets and not feeling ""finished"", and the second week I was able to go, but then began noticing with certain foods, my stool was formless (rice and broccoli tended to make this happen). Recently, I've noticed thin stools also. Appetite comes and goes
I do have a history of thyroid goiter and got half removed, and my doc suspects that an underactive thyroid could be causing this.

I'm 31 and I've had issues with my digestive system for a while now (6 months minimum) but the symptoms seem to be getting worse and the last week has been horrible.
I have a sharp pain just below my ribs on the left hand side, I feel bloated, my lower back is sore. In the last week I have completely lost my appetite which is unusual for me, I don't get mildly hungry until after lunch. All that points to IBS but my main issue is blood on my stools, it does not seem to be much, it's light and on the outside. My stools are pale and food not completely broken down. I'm not sure if it is connected but in the last 2 months my skin has become really dry.
My symptoms usually improve with a Rennie.
I went to the doctor and had blood and stool tests last week but I'm getting worried now.
If anyone has something similar it would be good to hear.
Thank you,
Luke

"Update, regarding my son on ibs symptoms. last time I spoke he was referred to peadiatriation who was not interested and done blood and stool test on my boy. Also he told me they were going to come back clear. 
Well got the test back and bloods came back fine , but the stool test for calprotectin showed slightly high levels and can be seen with inflammation, he wanted my boy to redo the test which we are still waiting for results as they take 5weeks. 
Im praying the results will show up again so he can get passed onto someone who specialises in digestive problems as this is been going on since birth and no one will listen and the poor boy been on laxitives most of his life . 
even though it's my boy who suffers, it's affected me big time as a mother with depression. I've complained for so many yrs that I've got to the point I'm imagining his symptoms. 
Does this test sound promising in getting answers. Just worried of being palmed of again.

"I am in my twenties and female. As far back as I can remember I have had issues with my bowels. I get constipated every week. I used to only have a bowel movement once a week, sometimes once every 2 weeks. All the online research I have seen always said to exercise, change what you eat, drink more water. And I have done just that. I even went as far as taking a laxative, which I honestly can say did nothing but make me gassy. My newest thing is eating an Activia yogurt one to two times a week. That has been helping but mostly I have more gas than an actual BM. So, my main symptoms are constipation, and I am bloated a lot! I bloat very easily. I also have GERD (acid reflux disease) so my stomach is very sensitive. Another symptom I get is right after having a successful (medium to large) stool, give it about 10 minutes and I feel pressure on my bum as if I have to go again. When I sit for long periods of time I notice the pressure gets worse, and when I try and go- nothing. I get gassy even right after going. I think, ok maybe I am not done and there's more. but sitting on the toilet trying to go and no result. 
Does this sound like IBS-C? Should I see a doctor for this or is there no treatment or cure?

"Hi, in all the six years approx that I have had IBS and prolapsed bowel  I have never had swelling and pain in my lower abdomen or bladder area, these past few days, I have been unable to wee some of the time, had severe bloating in that region so that I felt like I was pregnant - too old now - or could hardly walk, plus a lot of discomfort and pain and difficulty weeing. I don't understand with my type of IBS, that rarely presents like this, why I should have this, also about four months ago, my poo, short of having an anuerism, heart attack or bursting a blood vessel, would not come further than just above the entrance and I could not, no matter how I tried, force it out, had to manually assist and its been like this constantly for four months, now i have the extreme swelling and discomfort in my bladder I don't know what to do.  I have had a check for fybremalosis, or however you spell it, where you lose control of your muscles, but doctor says all is well there and has run tests, but I am also asking him Monday, in a telephone consultation, for a urine test for my kidneys, as I really do not know whats going on, it is painful to walk and also sit at the laptop so most of my time is spent in bed these days, pooing has always been uncomfortable and required considerable straining, but now, for about four months, it won't ""get there"" despite rigorous straining, what do I do, whats wrong with me?

"Hi all,
This has been going on for some time now, and I finally decided to go see a doctor who referred me to a gastroenterologist. I had the appointment, and soon I'll be tested for Celiac Disease and intestinal inflammation. In the mean time I was hoping some of you might be able to shed some light on the problem I'm having which is real uncomfortable! I guess what I'm looking for is people who experience the same symptoms as me and might know what's causing them or how to get relief. Onto the problem I'm having...
When I have a BM my stools come out all broken up into many pieces, as well as being semi-flat and sometimes a bit pale in colour. I experience incomplete evacuation where it feels like a little bit still remains inside my rectum giving me the slight urge that I need to go again. I often spend a very long time on the toilet in the hope I'll get more to come out. It's been a long time since I had a well formed 'log' that left me satisfied with my trip to the bathroom! I will get discomfort/pressure in my lower/middle abdomen and towards the inside of my rectum which is at its worst after I've just eaten. I'll get some relief from the discomfort after a bowel movement. Some bloating occurs after eating too, with flatulence and belching. The bloating will make my tummy feel sort of tight. Sometimes I get diarrhoea or constipation but not what I would call severe or even that often. In terms of pain I don't get much, apart from the occasional pain if I've eaten a big meal. On a few rare occasions I've had a small amount of blood on the paper when I've wiped, from having to go so many times during that day and maybe wiping too hard. I have felt like I've had a small cut in my anus before too, a possible fissure? like it kind of stung a little bit. That seems to have passed though, I do feel itchy back there relatively often though.
I think anxiety may have a part in this as I've been diagnosed with Aspergers and always feel anxious and a bit tense. I drink also but have tried to cut down and would like to eventually quit as I'm sure it's not helping with the problem. Could it be I just have IBS made worse by my anxious nature and drinking?

In a recent blood test my ""BUN"" numbers were 25. The range goes up to 20. Somewhat high and this means my kidneys are allowing PROTEIN to escape the Kidney Filters and enter my urine.
Because of ""UREA"" in the protein my Urine bubbles up. My question is as follows:

If anyone has any knowledge of kidney problems and can give me some advice - I would welcome it.

"Ok so I made a post on Monday explaining that I have bloating and gas occasionally seriously right after I eat (it gets old) just to see if anyone had similar symptoms. It mostly happens around my boyfriend for some reason but he doesn't make me nervous at all, I am comfortable with him. But then again, him and I get take out often and I rarely eat that much on my own time so unfortunately it does make sense as to why I feel that way. Anyway, I have been told that IBS is a severe condition, it can control your time and habits. Can make you rush to the restroom and be in there for a long time. That is not my case but why the symptoms of bloating and gas? I don't have constipation, it just takes me a while to go and even when I go, I still feel heavy. I have tried endless methods. Fiber intake, prune juice, pills.

"I've suffered from ibs off and on for years and always thought it was due to what I eat and drink but after recent tests on urine and stools which both came out fine I now realise it's depression and anxiety, I'm 77, male, and as I'm getting older and no wiser I appear to be suffering from a lot of anxiety, I think I know why, it's GUILT, I'm not  going into details but it happed nearly 50 years ago and as I age it is causing me a lot of sadness and guilt and knowing I can't go back in time to put it right makes it worse. Don't get me wrong it wasn't anything bad but it has affected me in a way now that I do get feelings of anxiety which I am sure brings on my ibs, perhaps I am punishing myself you see, I can' forgive myself.

I think I'm dealing with constipation altough my poo is soft and not hard.  There is a lot of straining and I never feel like I'm finished.  Ever.  My poo is usually pretty small and narrow but sometimes they are larger followed by small poo and then again never feels finished. 
The worst is the feeling that I have a golf ball up my bum.   Pretty gassy as well all day. 
sound like typical ibs?

"I'm sure I'm not alone but it it sure does feel like it. For years now I have been dealing with constant bloating and farther sounding gurgling in between every meal. I don't eat much but honestly it's mostly because of my fear of the annoying noises. My stomach has shrunk though I'm pretty sure due to my small diet. It does make sense that the food gets digested at a slow rate hence why it takes a long time for me to have bowel movement. But when I do try, most of the time nothing happens. It's an endless cycle and I don't know what's going on. Haven't had tests (don't have health insurance) but I don't even know if it's serious enough to go that far.

"Hi All
I've been diagnosed with IBS for a few months now, and I get all the usual symptoms with it, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, nausea, stomach and bowel churning, wind / gas. However, I also get some symptoms that are quite worrying and scary, and was wondering if any fellow IBS sufferers get this, or if anyone knows if these are normal.
I get bouts of feeling very weak, dizzy, faint to the point where I'll almost feel like I'm going to pass out, I also experience hot flushes and cold chills. These are the symptoms that I worry about most, and would like some help with. I can handle the normal IBS symptoms as I know they are typical symptoms, its the dizziness and feeling faint and weak that are the worrying ones. I'm also still loosing weight, albeit very slowly, however I contribute this to cutting out as much fat and sugar as possible, especially when I'm going through a flare up period, as I am right now.
Any help or advice about this would be greatly appreciated, especially if any of you IBS sufferers experience the same as I do.
Many thanks in advance.

"After my 8yr old had calprotectin test which showed slightly high levels with inflammation, he was asked to repeat the test, well the 2 nd test came back normal levels. So know pead is going back to the 1st theory of bowel overflow and said its just a blip. When I saw pead in Nov who said the test will come back all clear.but I have not told him I did the basic food intolence test on igg antibodies which came back positive result. Which as I'm aware that tells me his body is in fighting mode. This was done around the same time as the 1st stool test. So it's highly unlikely the 1st test was a false positive. He has know given my boy stronger laxatives which. The pead has it in his head that his constipated all the time but my boy is only constipated twice a month and I'm realising bread don't help.90 percent of the time he just does a pile of mush. But recently after taking this laxative he had to have a course of antibiotics. Well  after about a week the antibiotics stopped we saw some changes. Such as mood swings had gone. bad breath gone. Always eating now and saying hungry all the time. But the biggest thing we noticed his speech is so much clearer as he has speech delay.really thought were on a rd to recovery until a couple of weeks later smelly poo , bad breath again and mood swings are back. The pead also kept telling me on his stools that's just the way he is and he got to live with it. so yes I'm still banging my head against a brick wall in getting him sorted.

This only affects me in the morning or during the night when I awaken from sleep. The pain will go within 10 minutes of getting up out if bed and going about my day.
Does anyone have any insight into what this could be? I do suffer with gas and constipation as a result of IBS. I'm hoping that it's just a result of that.
I'd rate the pain 2/10.

"I have been trying apple cider vinegar with mother on the advice of a friend for my IBS.  The first day was brilliant, I didn't hear a whisper out of my prolapsed bowel (I also suffer with this) and the IBS was calm, second day it wasn't too bad, I went three or four times, and the prolapse combined with the IBS I get usually means I go about ten times, that's even with codeine relief, which cuts it in half, from 20 and sends a message from my brain to my bottom not to poo so often, quite literally, it does this, I have found with long term use, and today was also very good, I didn't need to go all day then about an hour ago, holy camole, one massive poo followed by two massive farts, which sounded rather like a cat having a very long growl, but I feel overall the cider vinegar IS helping, given that I go about ten times usually, although the final Jury is probably out until further trials have taken place, by me, I mean.  National clinical trials would indicate it does help, in fact.
I was able to paint my labrador, quite well, I should add, and rose early and full of enthusiasm, today and am just about to sketch out some daffodils to paint tomorrow as I have a friend who has just told me she is very fond of them, and always takes an interest in my art/poetry videos and photography, so that's it, it seems to be helping, and I'll let you know if this trend continues.  Six years I've had the prolapse and accompanying IBS, and despite major surgery, very little has helped with the symptoms, including the surgery itself.  Best wishes, Fiona

"Hi all, well my story. Last March 2015 I developed a burning acidy stomach which lasted about 2 weeks. Thought nothing of it and it slowly disappeared. I then had another flare up the next month for a week or so. Decided to see dr who diagnosed I B S and prescribed Colofac. I finished the course and thought it had worked but it kept coming back in 3-4 weekly cycles and then go away. Went back to the doctor who then pescribed Omeprazole which didn't touch it. The flare ups became more frequent one week on one week off. Went back again and said IBS. Asked for an endoscopy but asked me to try ranitidine and Alverin. My condition seems worse than ever with digestive issues, heartburn, indigestion behind ribs, pain in lower right abdomen, belching, trapped wind. It feels like my stomach is coming up through my rib cage sometimes. So stressed out with it. It's affecting my personal life, I'm so irritable toward my wife and child. I used to be so fit but don't feel like running as it just hurts when I go out. The days when i feel no symptoms I'm on top of the world then out of the blue a flare up can knock me back. I don't look forward to any holidays as I'm not sure how I will feel. I dread work as I just don't feel like going in some days but have not had one suck day. I try to ride it out which is a strain. I'm starting to get depressed with all this. I'm changing doctors as I want some definitive answers and more tests. Could it be H pylori or ulcers? I did have a very bad bout of food poisoning just before it came on in March 2015. Could it be more serious? As my subject says I'm at the end of my tether. Thanks for any info

This is my first post to this website. I am trying to naturally heal my stomach from severe bloating that has plagued me for years since I have just been diagnosed with generic IBS by my GP.
I am at a stage where I am experimeting with Betaine HCL with pepsin (Thorne). I have tried taking a pill with my first bite of food and also near the end of my meals with the same symptoms of feeling nauseous and more bloated! I don't have the symptoms of too much stomach acid such as a warming sensation however.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated as to if I should stop taking the supplement or if I need to build a tolerance?

"Someone please help me I'm losing hope with my IBS getting any better. I've made a post before saying IBS is ruining my life and it's only getting worse and I'm only 15.
I've mentioned a ton of stuff about my ibs before in previous posts so I will just ask about the current worse part that if this was solved I might see hope of living with the awful syndrome. Since November 2015 every single time I have a bowel movement I have not completed all at once. I haven't had a single solid stool since November. Every time it is broken up and parts get stuck inside my rectum. For some people they can handle this, I can't because of my OCD and GAD so I have become addicted to cleaning inside my rectum to make sure it's clean and nothing is stuck. Please don't judge me. To make matters worse there is a lot of mucus that is only getting worse.
I could potentially stop cleaning inside my rectum however until the whole thing where stools are getting stuck and I'm not fully completing bowel movements gets better in unsure as to whether I can bring myself to stop. Again please don't judge me I know I'm really messed up.
Recently about a week ago my doctor gave me a laxative called macilax as a last resort as I've tried everything else. I took the first dose on Friday and the second two on Saturday. Saturday night I had diarrhoea so it was working. I still wasn't going all at once however. Sunday was the last day I took the laxative. I missed school on Monday as I still had diarrhoea and also had the flu. It got that bad that Monday night I spent 5 hours on the toilet going a bit every 20 mins and the final time I went it felt like my intestines were falling out, I was almost crying in pain. I couldn't just get up either so I wasn't there for 5 hours because of the whole wiping situation.
I took an Imodium after that in the hopes of being ok for school the next day. I wasn't. I had another day off school and it kept feeling like I needed toilet however every time I went it was just bloody mucus. And passing this mucus hurt.
Wednesday morning my stomach had this weird pain which once again made me miss school. It's really bad for me missing school as my GCSEs are in a few months and I have a lot of stressful work to do. This pain was around the belly button area and happened every few seconds. It isn't agonising it's sort of slightly sharp at first, then really dull, then it goes, then repeats. I went back to sleep, got up a few hours later and the pain stopped after I had a bowel movement. However I was yet again there 5 hours and it wouldn't clean because I hadn't completed it and when I finally did complete it once again my intestines felt like they where falling out.
Tonight this other weird thing that happens every so often happened, normally before I need a bowel movement. It's where I feel a lot of gas moving from far inside my bowels sort of into my anal canal and the only thing holding the gas is my clenched anus hole. It's like holding in a fart however if I was to fart lots of mucus comes out. Sorry to be so graphic but there is no other way I can describe it and it's quite a massive problem. So tonight that happened then when I attempted a bowel movement all that came out was bloody mucus.
I think I couldn't have a bowel movement was because I haven't eaten much the past few days because of the flu. I can't go to the doctors atm because my gp is on holiday until next week. Last time my gp refered me to the paediatrician it didn't really help. The paediatrician dismissed everything I said, didn't give me proper chance to explain and his advice was to just get up after going once. Which doesn't help me what so ever. So when I attempt to see my gp next week I'm going to request to see someone else privately so that I might be able to get somewhere.
Until then please can anyone give me some advice on how to cope and what to do because I'm slowly losing all hope of ever being ok. Currently in trying the low FODMAP diet and I've tried a lot of different tablets and probiotics all of which have either done nothing or made it worse. Sorry for this being so long but I'm desperate for help and please don't judge me.
Thanks for reading.

"So currently my ibs is quite bad. Most days at school my stomach hurts and I spend hours on the toilet going multiple times because of broken up stools and lots of mucus.
I'm currently trying a low FODMAP diet and my stomach has stopped hurting as much during the day. My doctor have also given me macilax to help with broken up stools however after a day of taking them I've just had diarrhoea.
So is there any recommendations you have to stop going multiple times and having broken up stools plus is there any way to stop the mucus. I'm also under weight and need help with the low FODMAP diet and gaining weight but I don't want to eat bad foods to gain weight. My age is 15.
Thanks for reading I really appreciate help as ibs is really difficult for me to handle especially with the stress of school.

"Hello everyone. For the past few years now, I've been having some knagging stomach issues. I'll start off by listing some of the symptoms I've been having:
-Cramping (Occurs very often, sometimes an hour after eating and is way worse if I don't get much sleep the night before. If I dont get much sleep, I will cramp all day even after having a bowel movement until I go to sleep that next night.)
-Pulse in stomach (I can visibly see a pulse in my abdomen, around my belly button. It's made worse if I run or do any other form of activity. After I run, the pulse will be so strong that it shakes my entire body. I've heard some scary things about this, such as Aortic Aneurysm and stuff. There's no buldge or at least not a visible one. I am pretty thin but my friends who are even skinnier than me can't see their pulse in their abdomen.)
-Tender spot left of belly button (I have this very dull pain right on the left of my belly button but only if I press there. It very rarely hurts on it's own unless im pressing down on it.)
-Bloating and fullness (Sometimes after I eat, I will feel very full and bloated.)
-Nervousness (I get very nervous when I start cramping. I'm always afraid I wont make it to a bathroom.)
-Diarrhea (Sometimes will last for a whole day or 2 when I'm cramping. A lot of times has a yellowish color to it. Spicy food makes this 1000 times worse to the point where I can't even eat one bite of anything spicy.)
Those are the symptoms that concern me the most. I've been to the doctor twice for this but that was 4 years ago. I'm 20 now and I'm planning on going back probably next week. I'm pretty thin and I'm not in the best shape. I do eat a lot of fast food because it's the quickest on lunch breaks. I'm also a very fast eater, I always feel like I'm in a hurry when I'm eating. All of this is starting to take a toll on me so I decided so find somewhere I could ask for help and this is the first place I found. I've been getting terrible anxiety over all of this and it just makes it that much worse. Does anyone else deal with this kind of stuff? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time

"Basically I don't know where to start but here goes, I was a alcoholic from age 22 to age 27, I have been clean for over 3 years, I thought my life can only go up now, I've been having series abdominal pain for the last 2 years on and off but now it's everyday, it seems after I've opened my bowels the pain starts and it's really irritating as it wrecks my day and makes me really depressed and I do seem to take it out on people close to me but all I keep saying is I'd love you to feel this for 1 minute so you understand what it's like, I have gallstones and still an enlarged spleen which I'm dealing with also so I'm confused as to weather the gp is just saying it's ibs or its another underlying problem, the last 6 months I've had 2 really bad attacks of pain one which resulted in hospital as I couldn't bare, like stomach cramp which the longest episode has lasted nearly 3 hours to go, undescribable pain... Anyway I would like to know if any one suffers in this way or has had similar symptoms and if there's anything you have tried that relieves this, I'm on buscapan and lanzoprazole medication but does nothing, gp requested urgent ultrasound scan which I go for on Thursday this week and give me codeine but make me ill for the meantime. Basically I'm only 30 with a 9 year old son and 7 week old daughter and need to get this sorted as I'm frightened of getting really really depressed if you know what I mean. Thank-you for reading.

"Hi all, I started on the apple cider viniger with mother today, fortunately I am really not adverse to the taste in the slightest, and find I can easily manage two tablespoons twice daily in a glass of warm water with a little clear honey to take the edge off.  As I hear it there is bad bacteria in the gut and some people have more than others and an abundance can cause irritation hence IBS and also tests have been done on people fed identical diets where one put on weight and the other fed the apple cider with mother, (apple cider helps illiminate bad bacteria and the mother tops up the good) didn't.  Anyway cheapest I have been able to get this product is on the Boots website, I collected in store, problem here I typed in the name of the product and came back no search results but the product code is .. hang on, I will have to go to an earlier post and update in a sec, but anyway its about £3.50 for a huge bottle and I'll give you the code in a sec, hope this helpful, will update on any weight loss or loss of IBS symptoms in a couple of weeks or so, best wishes, Fiona

"I've been suffering for the last 2 months with incomplete bowel movements They are typically very thin.  Sometimes longer but most of the time small.  Occasionally I will have a thicker poo.  Could you go back and forth if there was a tumor obstruction.  Definitely feels like something is blocking my bowel.

"For about 3 weeks now every morning when I wake up I have to get to the restroom for a BM. The first BM is usually pretty normal and then I will have about 3-4 more that are on the very loose side. After that I feel absolutly great the rest of the day.  I have spoke with my doctor about this and have recently been diagnosed with Generalized Anxeity Disorder. She did some basic lab work and that all came back fine.  I am a little worried that this may be IBS or IBD,(of course the anxiety ridden part of me is worried it could be Colon Cancer) but the doc is leaning to it being caused by anxiety.  Has anyone had any similar expeirences?

"I am a 22 year old female and for the past four months I have been experiencing some tummy problems.
My symptoms have been pain in my lower left abdomen (occasionally sharp pains in right), constant feeling of trapped gas where I can feel gas trapped inside but I can't let it out (sorry tmi) and also occasionally I get a frequent urge to urinate.
I have been to the doctors numerous time, on all occasions doctors have felt a hardness in my lower left colon which they claim to be a build up of stool. However despite taking numerous laxatives this does not seem to go away.
I have had blood test and all normal. No gluten intolerances or anaemic etc. My doctor highly suggests this is ibs as I am so young and don't seem to have any red flag symptoms but I am still quite worried. I don't understand what could be causing the constant trapped gas and ""stool build up"".
I have a referral to see a specialist which I imagine will take a long time!
Any thoughts would be much appreciated!

"Has anyone tried cider viniger for their IBS?  Apparently it can help to regulate and illiminate some of the bad gut bacteria that can cause it. I had it recommended by a friend and then went on to google about it and found the above information.  What you do is put a tablespoon in a small  glass of hot water, adding if you like a spoonful of clear honey, as it tastes very astringent on its own and I'm a total wimp when it comes to my delicate tastebuds, and drink down two or three times a day. It can also help regulate your weight apparently as bad gut bacteria can actually cause weight gain they have done, the scientists, numerous tests on rats and found this to be so, anyway I am about to start, Tuesday when my shopping comes so if you like I will keep you all posted, best wishes, Fiona

"So for I'd say the past 18 I've had a issue with my stomach I can go a few months without a flare but when I get a flare up I'm ill for about 3-5 days,
It all started with bread fresh bread and pizza suddenly if even if I ate a tiny amount of either I'd end up within say 2 hours pretty much rolling around on the floor in utter agony, burping every few minutes and I don't mean a little one I mean a man type belch, severe pain bloated to the point I looked heavily pregnant and to press on my stomach almost brought me to tears, so I cut out pizza and fresh bread I can eat for example hovis and Kingsmill so problem whatsoever
So gp tested me for celiac run bloods all ok but I could never get in to see him mid flare then approx 2 months ago I had such a severe flare I phoned my GPS sobbing and managed to get in immediately he pressed on my stomach to which I almost lept of the bed and said I believe you have an inflammed gall bladder take antibiotics for a week and gave me high strength pain relief that pretty much sent me to sleep which helped me a lot. Ultrasound scan booked and done results showed no gall stones nothing sinister then had another flare and due to my pain levels my gp put a note for a same day appoint went in saw him he said your scan is clear you must have ibs take ibs relief and that's all
I feel very fobbed off as no ibs relief tablets work at all wind relief does nothing so I've been left in agony and rather fed up
When these attacks occur the first 2 days I'm very feverish have the chills and feel very latherigic, I belch frequently but do not fart or have constipation or diarrhea just bloated in pain finally if I eat a fatty meal it can cause a flare but it's hit and miss with fatty meals
I'm 5'4 53 kilos and eat a well balanced diet I rarely drink and my job involves me being active all day I'm in my mid 30's
Sorry I've rattled on for a while

"Hi all
Is any one else experiencing a number of different complaints with IBS,
I have always had a dodgy stomach and been really loose when I go to the toilet,
After years of doctor visits I was told I have ibs.
I have now over last 12 months started getting pains every where, started with lower back pain, which now is giving me pains and discomfort in top of right leg and groin area. I have had ultrasound on stomach, number of doctor visits, urine samples, blood tests and no answers.
The weird uncomfortable feelings I get around back, side, groin and upper legs are not that painful that it stops me doing anything, Being a male 29 and a builder I have always been active, so don't want to let this stop me.
Is this something any one else experiences with ibs or health anxiety.
Any feedback will be welcomed
Thanks in advance
Take care

"Ok so im in a bit of a bind with ibs-c (see what i did there)
I have been downing metamucil, 1tbsp twice a day and was taking lactulose 15ml at night and was regular for almost a week!  But side effects kicked in wtih the lactulose and i was waking up a little nauseous after a few doses, but it was relieved after multiple bowel movements.  Felt like there was a brick by my bladder.
So i wanted to start taking magnesium Oxide again but im not sure how to time my medications.  I take zantac after dinner(8:30pm) and Verapamil (11:00)  So from my understanding Mag Ox messes with the way zantac works.  What is the best way to do this?  I was told to take it before bed, but if something messes with the zantac i wake up wtih a sick feeling.

"I know everyones IBS is worse but im wondering if anyone suffers from the same symptoms as i do.
What will happen is i get bloated, feel the chills and weak/heavy arms then get super tired and need to rest.  If i dont treat the bloating, i will eventually feel nausea.  The next day is pretty rough, but i can eat and function to a certain extent.  By dinner tim 95% of the time im back to normal. 
The way i treat the bloating is by taking lactulose (mixed with gatorade) with a sip of water and that causes my insides to gurgle and pass a lot of gas.  95% of the time it helps, i go to bed and my day starts. 
An IBS attack is usually brought on by over eating.  My tolerance level is about the size of a subway 6"" sub.  If i eat too soon after or too much at once, i get the symptoms.  It also seems that if i take my vit d with dinner im usually ok.  Papaya pills also help if taken about 30 min after dinner. 
If i eat any of my nono foods then it comes on much faster and i actually get sick and dry heave/throw up (rarely food)

"So I'm new here, first time post, apologies if I'm missing some required etiquette.
I've had various ongoing health problems for some years. With the fact that it's multi-systemic in nature this might even be the wrong topic for the post entirely - but that's what I'm hoping to determine.
My issues started about 5 years ago. Prior to that I'd led an extremely active and healthy life style.
At around that point I was given a preliminary diagnosis for a connective tissue disorder (suspected Marfan) but to this date, that's yet to be confirmed (negative blood work or major criteria thus far).
As times gone on I've started to suffer with digestive issues. Which can be a potential related issue to CTD but lacking a 'positive there', I'm addressing alternatives for my low quality of life.
It's been much the same as a lot I've read here already: gas, belching (which does relieve pressure / stressed feeling) changing stool patterns (ranging from normal to undigested food, hard and black, soft and foul smelling) abdominal pain (centred around the lower right quadrant/flank) and continuing general constipation.
As a result of that I also suffer from what seems to be acid reflux, which has been completely uneffected by ppi's such as lansoprazole, omeprazole (and actually got worse on them) along with alternatives like ranitidine. I assume it's directly related.
I've been for various scans; including ultrasound recently for gall/pancreas, general hospital X-ray, heart mri. Blood tested to death and back. Infact the only thing not screened thus far is the bowel, for whatever reason that may be.
Some time earlier it had been suggested I had IBS by a GP and I was prescribed peppermint oil, which made me nauseous but otherwise had no effect.
To add to my list of problems I've been waking up with a racing heart/tachycardia and inconsistent pains in my chest (centre and left side). Things again which can potentially be related to a CTD - but also possibly digestion in isolation and general nerve irritation.
In the background of all this: I have tinnitus at regular intervals, headaches in various locations, a feeling of disorientation and imbalance, tingling in the extremities and a general feeling of being unwell.
The overlap is considerable and my GP just seems overwhelmed by the different symptoms.
I've yet to factor in food intolerance but that's another thing that's been suggested. So I've rotated my diet over the course of weeks to try and see if things resolve with dairy/gluten and so forth. No change there either.
Until I get a definitive answer on my over all disorder, which as yet remains unproven to whether I even actually have one, or which one - I'm left to my own devices.
It's my personal belief a lot of wider problems are currently caused by my digestive issues and the has pressure it creates but it's a concern when you have potentially underlying and undiagnosed issues looming in the back ground as well.
Right now I'm almost permanently fatigued, so this likely won't be the best post! Apologies for that.
To that effect any advice on how to refine / perhaps make the search for answers a little more concise, would be appreciated.
Could IBS be the foundation of my wider problems or sinething else?
The NHS in the UK aren't fast to assign visits to different departments and as such the delays and Incontinuity between departments have been considerable whilst trying to find the underlying cause.
The digestion problem is quite circular, they prescribe me medication that seems to make little difference and I've grown weary of trying different products all to no avail.
Any further suggestions as to what to investigate next would be welcome too as its now been a good many years since I've really had an 'ordinary' day.

"Hello.
I started with IBS symptoms last year. It started with a very annoying and loud gurgling tummy. It was so weird. I would eat to try and stop it but it actually made it worse. Also I started having diarrhoea after I ate. I also suffer from constipation too. I've had lots of flare ups of this but I get very nauseas too. I have Googled it and it does say it can be a symptom but I have friends with IBS and they don't get nausea.
I get very bloated and my tummy constantly gurgles. Last fare up I lost 8 lb in 2 weeks. I don't really get cramps just a big gurgle then I need to go the toilet. Also my flare ups seem to last week's! I'm not constantly on the toilet it's just when I eat. About half an hour after eating I'm on tge toilet. The nausea is driving me mad. Does anyone else get this and is there anything I can take to help? Peppermint doesn't do anything for me

"I suffer a lot with IBS and its weird really, every day I'm on the same diet, which I consider to be a healthy mix of healthy foods with a bit of what I fancy thrown in which may or may not be considered by ""the experts"" as the best options, but there is not much variation and certainly not on the rare occasions when I get a ""good day"".  Now if you speak to people, many people, with IBS, I've noted they all say the same thing, they are aware that diet is important, and different foods suit different people but many like me are struggling as whatever they eat, good bad or indifferent, upsets the delicate digestive balance, so I have come to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that as it often makes little difference to the sufferer, why not just basically eat what you want, not suggesting burgers and pizzas all the time, you understand, but I really think these days, after five or six years of suffering this complaint, that eat what you like within reason, if you are going to be ill anyway, why be miserable and miss out on the things you like on top of it, sorry if this differs with what ""the professionals"" tell us, however I think I am right in this thinking basically.

"There really is no way of saying this without saying it, for two weeks recently I had daily, well, with the added complication of my prolapsed bowel, every fifteen minutes, frankly awful ""stuck halfway"" syndrome and was in the end tearful, frustrated and did not know what to do, I am loathe to take laxatives, as despise diarrhoea and how it makes me feel, so reached for my peppermint teabags and after drinking down just one  cup and subsequently daily for five days, now a permanent fixture, well, whatever was disrupting my poor stomach, and I have diverticular as well so the possibilities are somewhat endless, I found some relief, I still had difficulty, but have put up with this for five years and despite major keyhole surgery, but it seemed to help, just one cup a day, and has now become my regime.  Oddly, as I can't bear anything bitter, I actually add half a cow to mine and it still does the trick, just thought I'd share, I think the peppermint soothes the stomach and therefore bowel and relieves some of these very unpleasant symptoms, I am so grateful, don't know if it could help anyone else?

"So I want to tell my story about my IBS because I'm stuck and don't know what to do anymore so please, please don't judge me and take this seriously.
It might be a bit long I will try my best to keep it as short as possible.
I am currently 15 years old, in April 2015 I has off school for a half a week with a stomach bug causing me to have really bad diarrhoea. The week after when I was back at school my stomach was still hurting. A couple weeks later after half term I went back to school but every single morning it felt like I needed to poop but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't. On weekends I got up later at around 11 am and then at that time I could poop. I basically found out that every morning it felt like I needed toilet but I couldn't go until around 11 am. It was horrible but nothing compared to how I am now.
It got slightly better around June, July time then during my 6-7 weeks off school for summer I was mostly ok because I got up later. Problem was that towards the end of the holiday I went to stay in London for half a week and whilst I was there I was getting up early again. Now this is where I made a weird mistake. When I got to the hotel room after a day of not going I went but it was really hard and no matter how much I wiped it wasn't cleaning (I've been using baby wipes to wipe since around the start of 2015). For some stupid reason I decided to try and stick my finger covered in a wipe inside to see if I could get what was left out, please don't judge me I know it's weird and not normal but please listen. I realised at that point how unclean the inside is and ever since then I've been addicted to wiping inside because I know how unclean it is and I'm scared of it potentially leaking out. I will say now I have generalised anxiety disorder and slight OCD and I am receiving therapy to help me. Well I had some kind of diarrhoea on that trip but it wasn't too bad but ever since then I've cleaned inside. Please don't judge me it's a real problem.
I started school again in September and well it was still bad, the thing where I couldn't go in a morning was no longer happening but I don't like going in a morning because I just don't have time. I normally went when I got home from school and would stay there for an hour plus and every day it was different, either constipation or diarrhoea. Throughout October I got some small piles and after multiple doctors appointments I used different creams that worked. I tried a bunch of different tablets to try and fix my awful bowels but nothing helped I tried everything from buscopan to mebeverine and nothing worked. Sometimes there was blood from the piles or anal fissures.
In December I went to Russia on a school trip. Just before that when I was wiping I noticed some weird mucus type stuff towards the end of wiping and I wasn't emptying my entire bowels at once I was going multiple times. Whilst in Russia the poor food made it worse, over Christmas it didn't get much better and it got to a point where I was spending 3 hours in the toilet going multiple times every day. Since I started back in school in the new year it has gotten to an all time worst. Every morning when I get up my stomach hurts and I can hear gas gurgling in my rectum not my stomach but I'm scared to fart incase I follow through.
Ever morning I need to go it no longer feels like I need to go now I have to go and because I don't have the time to spend hours on the toilet going multiple times in a morning I hold it in all day which is awful. When I do go it's normally very lose and I still go multiple times and this mucus stuff is there when I'm wiping. It's sticky and weird. I've tried laxatives to empty my bowel all at once and it didn't work, I've tried probiotics they just made it worse. My doctor has referred me to a pedestrian at the hospital who I will see in April but until then I don't know how I'm supposed to cope, I'm really stressed out with my GCSEs and I don't get much sleep on school days and I waste hours everyday on the toilet in pain.
A couple weeks ago I was off school because I went toilet 15 times in one day but it was diarrhoea, it looked as if I'd gone for the first time every time, I was pooping so much and had no idea why. I had blood tests and the only things they found is slightly high level of chemicals in my liver. Whilst I was off school last week for half term I was going toilet twice a day, I was going around 2 am and 2 pm and both times I would be there for two hours.
I'm back at school now and I don't have the time to spend so long at the toilet. I'm going so much over and over again and it's ruining my life. I just want a way to cope until I go to the hospital, someone please help me find a way to cope. The mucus now leaks slightly if I don't clean the inside so until I stop that happening I can't break my habit of cleaning inside. Please help me how do I cope it's a living hell for me for hours every single day.
I'm really sorry this is so long but I need help desperately. Thanks for reading.

"I have been having diarrhea every time I go poop. 95% of the time there is blood, sometimes a lot, sometimes less. It seems bright red and darker red (although it could be due to the amount) there is also dark red mucus. There is always a lot of mucus.
I sometimes have cramps in my abdomin.
I was examined by a doctor and he did not find anything.
I am schedualec to have a colonoscopy at the end of March. I can't handle the wait and would like to know some things it could be. Any info would be greatly appreciated.

"i have suffered 23 years with ibs.it was caused by an allergic reaction to an antibiotic which left me quite ill .however 2 years later I developed fibromyalgia as well which I found out from the rheumatologist can go hand in hand with ibs.it is a debilitating condition with severe muscle pain which adds to the pain and discomfort of ibs.like most sufferers the conditions come and go but I have noted my symptoms happen nearly always in January over February ? Which to me suggests it can be seasonal.has any one else noticed this? .however I firmly believe as one or to people have said that it is phycological and down to stress  ,and interestingly my gastroenterologist who diagnosed the condition advised me to take up yoga!!!!

"Now this may seem odd but bear with me. 
I am sure there may be a time when you may realise I have not been the loo for a few days and you know if this were to continue you may be very ill a few more days down the line so does anyone here have a ""super"" food which is super for them which they may use to trigger the condition knowing a mild trigger now is much worse than a major relapse later.
I suppose this would come under the area IBS followed by constipation followed by IBS if there was such an area.  The constipation period does not need to be painful and in fact it can feel quite normal but you know this is only deferring the illness.
Does anyone have any concept of what I mean as this is specific to me at the moment so as you may have guessed I am just highlighting my symptoms and this may be where some use medication. 
My concern about eating foods that may be well known for making one run to the loo like prunes may be too fibrous and instead of going from gentle visit may lead to a full blown IBS episode, which I am desperately trying to avoid, so wondered what gentle foods you may use if you go through a similar cycle to the one I am going through now. 
Thank you

"Hi
I'm on here to see if this online commu.nity can help give me an idea of what's going on.
Here's the story so if you can shed light on it, I'm not joking I will thank you forever, as its driving me mad....
I started getting pain in the upper right quadrant abdominal area, 2 finger widths down below bottom rib 27 years ago. I'm 47 now and male.
The pain wasn't very deep, just below muscle, I would say if you cut me open in that area it would be the first organ you came to.
The pain would come maybe twice a year and be so bad at times I would go to A&E. Pain was a dull ache gripping pressure type pain that would go after about 4-5 hours of climbing the walls and pacing. Or 6 paracetamol and a handful of ibuprofen. Once the hospital gave me a shot of morphine which also worked.
Had an ultra sound in the states, but came back clear, the guy who did it though was a bit shabby though. Had an xray here, that came back clear and had every blood test under the sun, all clear, slightly high cholesterol, 0.5 over normal range.
First got pain after around a difficult period in my life, now it's less painful, more constant though. If I have coffee of a morning. I have about 3 poo s straight away and when I used to drink alcohol, I'd have 4 or 5 poo s when getting ready because of excitement.
IBS has been mentioned, gallbladder issues, spastic Collin blah blah blah.
I just want to know what this pain is, it's driving me crazy and no doctor wants to give a diagnosis. It's not deep in my body and is overt to the right below my rib cage. I've had all the cancer blood tests and my GP said it's not that, but I'd really love to know what the he'll it is.
Sorry, I know it's a long post, but wanted to give the full picture.
One more thing on location, the pointy bit on your right bottom rib before it slopes down towards your back, I'd say it was 2 fingers right of that, then 1 or 2 fingers down then 2 fingers deep. The pain is spread in area the size of a small tangarine. I have had it for 27 years intermittent, so I wouldn't say it's life threatening, I've had no jaundice , blood in poo etc either. Just want to know what the he'll it is.
Any thoughts anyone.
I would be in your debt.

"Hi, after six years of agony with a prolapsed bowel, frequency based constipation and ""one at a time"" taken to a whole new nightmare level, ""stuck halfway"" syndrome, and the ensuing exhaustion, pain, discomfort and self disgust, I am going to ask my Consultant to test my gall bladder, spleen, pancreas and liver for any problems which may relate to why I have such a radically abnormal troublesome bowel.
It didn't occur to me to go down this route until a friend mentioned that often other organs can be the root cause of the problem and I feel it is fair to say that nowadays Consultants DO NOT do the job they are paid to do and suggest things to the patient such as this, it is almost wholly down to the patient to do the donkey work, which I feel is grossly unfair as they are the professionals and the patient may have learning or mental issues, that make it difficult for them to recognise these factors, plus if they do have mental health issues, quite abusively in my opinion, their symptoms are often put down as ""behavioral"".  Now I KNOW this to be true from six years of ghastly experience of the NHS system, and I am niether lying or exaggerating, I speak honestly from experience.
Anyway I have a proctogram on the 29th Feb, and no doubt it will be a month or even two month wait before I can subsequently get to see the Consultant but I will keep you posted, and I going to be quite firm about wanting extra tests as as well as my friend pointing this out I have read in a medical journal that other organs can be the root cause of bowel problems, and I've had six years of being palmed off and I've had enough!

"This the first time I have started a discussion and laid out this level of detail so please be gentle. Here goes an evening in the life of IBS:
My illness is more intermittent now but when the illness does strike it is severe hence why I have been discussing with you because it not only affects my ability to work but also my mental wellbeing.
I have tried tracking my illness a few times and here is the most recent:
On the day of illness I had a 20 minute walk in the morning and a further 20 minute walk in the afternoon.  I am not working at the current time so not particularly stressed.  On the day of illness I ate porridge with a small banana, a salad and in the evening 2 pieces of wholemeal toast with scrambled egg and half an apple, a few grapes and a yoghurt and I checked and the eggs were in date up to the 6th Feb.  The previous day I ate the same except my evening meal was a baked potato and a small tin of baked beans. I eat baked beans a lot and I am not ill. Three hours later after the scrambled egg at 11pm: 
1.       Sudden abdominal pain below my ribs on my right hand side.  This pain lasted approx. 10 mins then it would subside and 10 mins later the pattern would repeat.
2.       After one hour, midnight, I could stand no more so decided to go to bed but trying to sleep in this cycle is difficult, so lay in bed waiting for the cramp to strike again.
3.       After a further hour, 1am, I get the feeling that maybe I need to use the loo.  I spring out of the bed, such is the urgency, and do so.  At this point everything is normal ish and apart from the rush to get there.
4.       Now the cramp cycle is replaced with another cycle of going to the loo and feeling better for 10 or so mins and then needing to use the loo again and repeat. 
5.        After about 30 mins my throat feels like it is contracting, my mouth fills with saliva and my forehead is perspiring.  On this occasion there is no sickness but it is at this point I normally would be sick, about 2 and a half hours from the first cramp.
6.       At this point my body takes over and I lose control of it as my body starts convulsing and the result is quite violent.  Without being too graphic think cow pat. It is now at the truly horrible stage.   
7.       Now my body goes into a cold sweat.  I am very tired and the bed is beckoning and then yet again my body takes over and I rush back to the loo one more time.
8.       Finally at 2.20am I believe I am comfortable enough to fall asleep 3 hours and 20 mins from the first cramp.
The following day I arise late have no appetite and manage dry toast and soup all day.
Has anyone had anything similar and found a way to cure this as I used to get this 2 – 3 times a week so it is no wonder my g/f had enough of me but now it is more intermittent maybe bi-monthly.  I have introduced exercise, eliminated stress at the moment and eat much better with salads and fruit salad but yet it still happens.
I am thinking of returning to work hence why I need to try and find solutions because in a working environment I will only get worse.
All ideas will be gratefully received. 
Please help

"I'm asking in this forum because my Mom has IBS and has said what's happening to me is similar.
I've always struggled to go for number 2 regularly. I suffered severe constipation as a young child and have always only gone once a week or every week and a half.
No bowel movement is painless for me, it's been that way so long that I just didn't think anything of it.
The past week though I have had the most excrutiating bowel movements where I am in tears, I was tensing so much I felt a pop in my head (but I don't know what that couldve been, it wasn't nice though).. Aswell as that I have an awful pressure in my pelvic area, and well, it feels like when you're desperate for a wee but there is nothing there. It doesn't hurt to urinate but I am urinating far too much. The pressure I'm feeling isn't painful just uncomfortable, I can't lay down, I'm contantly squeezing my legs together which relieves the feeling for a few seconds. I'm waking up in the middle of the night with severe pain and then I will be on the toilet for and hour or two.
I don't want to go doctors if it's just a regular problem, is there anything I can do? Is it something serious? I've never felt so uncomfortable. My bladder and bowels ALWAYS feel full recently and it's an awful feeling. I'm starting to fear going to the toilet, I havent feared the toilet since I was a child.
I don't know what to do.

"Hello,
Been a while since I posted in IBS, however for last few months, run into a little dliemma. Whether to go for a colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy or just accept that I have IBS and Health Anxiety.
My symptoms right now are worrysome yet extremely mild and liveable. I got this discomfort, like tension in my lower, mainly left side of my pelvic are, just below the belt line, kind of just above my manhood area, maybe jst a little higher. I went to the doctors about this, I have no Red Flag symptoms, I have actually managed to increase my weight over the past 6 months, now weighing a pretty good 71-72 KG which for me is an ideal weight. I dont have any pain that wakes me up, the only blood in stool is from when my hemmorhoids worsen and inflame and my stools, well, as with all, I always have some complaint, sometimes flat, other times bulky, sometimes floating, other times sinking, its something that has plagued me for some time. Now the doctor recommended UltraSound and Bloods, both were fine. the only thing my doctor had worried about was one of my liver functions was sligtly abnormal but this was a few days after heavy drinking on New Years EVE/DAY, so she stated this would be the direct cause. She mentioned that if the pain became more severe, she would recommend I see a Gastro, and perhaps they would do a colonoscopy, but she was not worried and since has perscribed me with Xanax for my Health Anxiety. 
I know at 30 years old, only a few months since turning 30, I have a very little chance of having colong cancer, no one in my family has had it, I dont smoke, I am not Obese and I eat very healthy, lots of fruit and vege and very little red meat, not losing weight, when I had the FOB test, they only found the hemmorhoid blood on the outside of the stool but nothing in it and I have also seen a surgeon who conducted a digital rectal exam and anascopy who said that my colon, as far as he could see looked very healthy and that if I am worried, go in 5 years time for colonoscopy.

"Next week I'll have a friend from America visiting me in the UK for a month, and I'm trying to compile a list of foods that set off her IBS so that I know what to avoid when cooking. However, she's only been recently diagnosed--about six months ago--and she's still learning what does and doesn't upset her. One of the items that she's listed as a no-go is ground red meat; it makes her sick when she eats it prepared by her family, and yet she can eat food from fast food places such as Taco Bell without any repercussions. (Yes, I know--I wouldn't exactly call that 'meat' myself, but...!)
What I'm wondering is, exactly what might it be in the meat that's setting her off? Could it be the natural oils that come out when cooking ground meat, that might not be present in fast food meats, which are usually cooked until they're very dry? My last housemate had IBS as well and an issue with red meat isn't something that I've heard of before, so I thought that this forum might help me to understand it all a little better. I could, of course, avoid cooking her meat altogether, but since her diagnosis she's stopped eating almost completely and is clinically underweight, so I'm determined to try and feed her up a little while she's visiting. The more foods I can get her to realise she can eat without getting sick, hopefully the better for her, in the long run!
In case it's of any help to spot trends, the foods that she knows she can't eat so far are: sausage (including chorizo and pepperoni), spices, black pepper, ground meat, caffeine, carbonated drinks, and cheese (non-white and cheddar).
Thank you in advance for the help!

"I've had IBS for about 17 years and I am convinced that all the erratic & chaotic bowel movements may be caused by as yet an unidentified BUG and I will give my reasons.
About 25 years ago people afflicted with Ulcers were placed on special diets. It was also believed that high strung people or type A personalities got ulcers.
Until the medical profession discovered a bug which caused ulcers and ever since then patients are treated with antibiotics.
IBS:
The same varied food diet treatments have been applied to all IBS PATIENTS. Diet! Diet! Diet! To no avail. The medical profession is unable to SAY WITH CERTAINTY what foods or what else may be causing IBS.
CONCLUSION
I believe science must continue to search for a possible bug which causes people to run to the bathroom at all hours of the day with all the embarrassment attended with it.
IT IS A BUG and this is just a lay person's opinion.

I do eat Oats but that's the only grains I'm having - otherwise it's Paleo/AIP Paloe diet plus low fod map and trying to avoid GERD foods too. It's ridiculous.

"For the last couple of years I've experienced bouts of nausea and bloating, gradually worsening to episodes of vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating, the shakes and lethargy. (Many nights spent on the bathroom floor).
After many unsuccessful GP visits and experimenting with my diet I have come to the conclusion that gluten triggers these bouts of illness. 
I am really interested to hear from others about their food intolerances and the symptoms they have to put up with. 
I have been gluten free for about two months, and this has made me feel a lot better. However if I accidentally ingest gluten my symptoms come back with a vengeance. 
Does anybody else find this? 
I would like to hear from those who also suffer like me and hear your stories. 
Thanks, 
fed up Grace x

"I have impacted stool. Its day 7 of not pooping (last time i did i was in the hospital for constipation and hemorrhoids) and i went to the clinic yesterday and they told me to take Magnesium Citrate and if i didnt poop i guess my this noon i should go to the hospital. I took it 10 last night and its 8. 10 hrs later way after it shouldve worked.. my stool is lower for me to touch but it feels to big to push out and hard to take out. My mom wants to do it but i'd rather her not (we dont have the best relationship so i dont want her finger there) and a professional do it. My stomach hurts like i should go but i feel my stool is stopping it. Should i try again before my mom tries to attack me down there. And when should i stop trying because i dont want to do further damage. I took enema last night i only leaked and had blood. Idk if i should go to the hospital please help

"So I went to the doctors on Tuesday after having a tummy that's been grumbling for nearly a week and having constipation. She said it sounds like ibs and gave me some info to take away and read.
Last night about 3 am I had to get out of bed and go to the toilet with really bad diorreah. Today I'm back to having a really gurgling stomach and finding it hard to pass wind and go for a poo again. I feel tired and lethargic and also have a slight bit of Back ache.
I have never been like this before so guessing this is a flare up and should hopefully settle down. I would say this has been happening for a little over a week now.
Will it settle down or is this it? And what types of food do people think triggers it all off?

"I've had some significant changes in my stool and my doctor thinks it might be IBS. I'm currently waiting on the results of a biopsy taken during a colonoscopy and an endoscopy. There has been no blood, but there has been some instances of constipation, back pain, and abdominal pain on both sides. I am a male in his early 20s so I am very concerned.
My stool can vary in quantity, consistency, and thinness/thickness. The thinness of my stool is the most concerning. Some days it is small, like pencil thin pellets, other days, it's like a flat ribbon. Sometimes, this can change in the same bowel movement.
Does this seem like IBS? The colonoscopy/endoscopy did not show anything except for a some mild gastritis, and I am still waiting on biopsy results. The colon, esophogas, and everthing else looked fine except for the mild gastritis.

"Last year I had a terrible Year, I lost one of my best friends to cancer very suddenly, my darling Mum had a massive stroke and passed away after 4 days and my husband and I are now separating and selling our house. So a very stressful time.
I was diagnosed with suspected shingles back in October of last year. The rash never came out on my skin. The Dr gave me anti viral drugs but after the 72 hour window in which you are meant to take them for any effect/help, I also had a urinary infection at the same time and was then on antibiotics too, my stomach was a bit of a mess after.
Just before I was diagnosed with shingles I got a dull ache pain just under my right rib. Which continued after the suspected shingles had gone.
The Drs thought it could be either postherpatic nerve pain, (as the shingle rash didn't come out) or IBS or gallstones.
I had an ultrasound scan done, they found a polyp in my gallbladder, Dr said soft tissue shouldn't give you pain. I've had bloods done, stool samples and urine samples checked all clear. Stomach pressed and checked no lumps and no pain when pressed down.
I still have this pain which can spread from under ribs right side to down right side and into hip, in the middle just under ribs to round belly button. And now new thing in the past two weeks a dull nagging pain in my middle and upper back and sometimes at night it can be really bad like someone is sticking a knife in me. If I sit up for a while it goes or if I take some gavascon remedy it goes.
My stomach doesn't feel like it used to and the rest of my poor body feels like its been hit by a bus.
Does any of this sound familiar, can anyone shed some light on what it could be. As my Dr is none the wiser..??

"hi all,
i have had IBS for 5 or so years. i used to just get very very bad gas and constipation, then as of 18 months ago i started with diarrhoea too.
my question is does anyone have and remedies for the bad gas? i have done the FODMAP diet and i avoid those foods that i identified as triggers from this, but i still get the gas. it is worse when i am constipated which makes sense, but my gas and stools always smell very bad.
over the years i have suspected that i have something like SIBO but this is not really recognised by dr's in the UK.
i have tried pro and pre-biotics, probiotics made it worse and prebiotics did nothing.

i recentley been reading a lot about these so bought some to try. here is why. all the men in my family have alyways suffered from heartburn etc. and we have always pretty much eaten Rennies and antacid daily. i decided to go to my docs once and was told i have high acid and that i need to take PPI Protien Pump Inhibitors. 2 years ago i got the worst bloating ever and then 2 days later i found an umbilical hernia. related im not sure. however since then ive bloated and had pain after i eat and almost constant constipation. qulity of life for the last 2 years has been terrible. i had the operation for the hernia 6 months ago and since then its been even worse. i read that it is more likley that i would have low staomach acid which causes digestive upset etc, and that taking PPI would pretty much finish off all stomach acid production. so i decied to stop these and try increasing my acid with Betaine HCL pills. for the first 4 days i fellt like i had been cured and that i had so much energy. but the other day the bloat came back and i feel poo again. i have pretty much every symptom of low stomach acid and i tried the bicarbonate of soda test 3 mornings in a row. mix with water and and drink if no burp in 5 mins it is liley you have low acid. anyway. my doc never tests me and just say IBS IBS. which i read is a covering term for many stomach issues. but i need to get to the bottom of it as i cant go on like this. there is no point i have no life anymore. please if anyone has and ideas please reply to me. thanks in advance

"Hi All
Just wondering if anybody out there can help with the types of pains I should be getting that are associated with IBS.
Since yesterday I have been having all sorts of abdominal, chest and back pains that feel like I'm being stabbed randomly by either something sharp or something blunt. These are the normal / usual pains I get, however there is one pain I have been getting that is different to these and is quite worrying. I have a sore, stinging, tearing pain inside me around my lower left abdomen, level with my belly button. It seems to ease off then flare up, and keeps repeating this process, it also seems to get worse with movement as well. Is this a typical IBS pain, or could it be something else. This pain is different to the usual pains, which is why I'm asking for some help.
Any info, help and advice would be greatly appreciated.
Many thanks in advance.

"My 12 year old son was diagnosed with IBS probably about 2 years ago.  Mainly due to fairly regular tummy pain.  He does not really suffer from sickness of diarrhoea.  He usually just dealt with it by using pain relief and Omeprazole.  He has had blood tests, scans,biopsies, cameras (both ends) twice and nothing has been found.  He is not coelliac.  He has twice been anaemic due to blood in poo (the reason for cameras being done). He can go for months with no problems at all and then have a period of pain that can last a few days and seems to be extremely painful.  On the most recent occasion his wee brother has had a tummy bug.  On previous occasions when my 12 year old has had a tummy bug (not just IBS symptoms) he seems to have a day or two prior to being sick of being in agony with his tummy.  He was bend double and no medicine seems to help.  Do people with IBS have worse symptoms than others when they have a tummy bug? Do people with IBS get tummy bugs more often?  I did mention this the last time we were at hospital but I didn't really get a straight answer.  Any advice would be great.

"ADVISE NEEDED!!!!
So, I've been suffering from IBS-D for about a year now. I've suffered from tummy issues since birth. I also have acid reflux. I have changed my diet COMPLETELY and noticed improvement on the horrible IBS cramp flare ups. I do still suffer each day with still running to the bathroom. BUT!!!!!!!! Now... about 3 days ago, I hate too much dairy (which I usually don't, cause I noticed it irriated my IBS) well, huge mistake. Now, I'm in the rest room 6 times a day, lots of rumbling in the tummy, air trapped, burping, etc and I have this constant pain in the epigastric area. Which is the center of top of the stomach. Right under my ribs, where the stomach is located... smack dap centered! I know it's my stomach inflammed, it's gotta be. I just have this constant pain... since that dairy eating episode and it's been 3 days and nothing is better. I don't feel the pain when I'm laying down though. Only if I get up to move and walk around.. and when I eat it makes it feel better. But, at the same time, it irritates it and the pain sometimes comes back. SAME SPOT!!!!!!! So.. uh.. what is this???? Is this a lactose reaction Mixed with IBS?????? 
 PLEASE SOMEONE SHARE THEIR MIND ABOUT THIS...
I'm looking into taking some probiotics and NO MORE DAIRY!!!! & continuing my IBS diet. I'm just trying to avoid a horrible uncalled for doctor bill. 
thanks for your time!

" I have abdominal pain about 10 cm to the right of my belly button.
It is a stitch like pain when I am not applying pressure and when i press on it it really hurts. Feels bruised. I have not done any exercise and have had a c-section so have some excess skin and also mussle definition is a bit all over the place.
I have also had a lot of gas for about six months but did not put two and two together.
I had a sigmoidoscopy in aug and all was fine and ultrasound which show nothing just a small gall stone about 4 mm. 
Could this be just muscular? Sometimes if i lie on my right side there is a sharp pain in that area like a sharp rod has been pushed in but quickly goes. 
Does anyone know what this is? It started before the sigmoidoscopy.
I have had a duodenum ulcer in the past (confirmed with an endoscopy) and have internal haemmaroids that sometimes bleed and this pain is a lot less.
Sometimes I feel the pain on my waist and travels to my back.
Not sure if the pain is getting worse I am just more aware of it.

"Last year in April I had diarrhoea for a week. When I went back to school every morning I felt like I needed to go toilet but I couldn't. On a weekend I woke up later at 11 am. I found out that I could only go toilet after 11 am even though a feel like I need to go earlier, I also needed to go every day whereas before I didn't. In August I went on holiday and I didn't fully empty my bowel and my stomach was hurting. Instead of wiping then going back later I decided to try and wipe the inside to get whatever was left out and realised how dirty and unclean the inside is. Long story short ever since I've been wiping inside because I'm scared that it's not clean inside and it might leak out. Recently the past month instead of taking around 30-40 mins to wipe inside to make sure it was fully clean I took a lot longer because it wouldn't clean at all, not even the outside. Turns out that in not fully emptying it again and it won't be clean until I have fully gone so I'm going toilet for a very long time. How do I make it so that I fully complete my bowel movement, please don't comment on the whole cleaning inside thing, I do have GAD and am receiving cognitive behavioural therapy to help me. I am also currently 15 years old.

Each time, something else is eliminated - gall stones, pancreas, twisted bowel, and each time, the doctors are delighted to tell me they've ruled out 'one more thing'. I'm not delighted, just frustrated witht the health care system.  One hospital thought I was 'faking symptoms' - hard to fake pain like this, isn't it?

"Hi everyone. I am really hoping someone will reply to me. To cut my story short, I was diagnosed with IBS 8 years ago. For the last 3 years I felt quite ok. I was taking 2 immodium a day when I felt I needed it but no other problems really. But last week I started with really bad stomach ache and then diarrhoea. I had diarrhoea for few days and really bad stomach ache so went to see GP who said its gastroenteritis.  For the last 2 days I ate bananas and plain white rice. I felt better but really weak. I lost 7 pounds in 5 days. Today I thought I will try and start eating. I had boiled potatoes and poached salmon and some beetroot. As soon as I finished it I had to run to toilet with bad diarrhoea and a bit of stomach ache again. The food just went straight through me. I really dont know what to do? I want to be able to eat food and actually keep it inside. Can someone please help me? What do you all do when you cant eat and food goes straight through you? Also my GP doesnt seem to care about my problems at all. He just tells me to take immodium but I dont want to take this for the rest of my life?

"Hi I've had IBS for about 2 years now, and I've tried so many things to help but nothing ever seems to, so I just kind of get on with it. It causes abdominal pain and constipation but I'm used to it now anyway. But lately some new symptoms have arose that I haven't experienced before. I think it could be indigestion/acid reflux but I'm not entirely sure. It started about 2 weeks ago, I started feeling intense nausea when I woke up, literally as close to vomiting as I possibly could be. Now as I also suffer from emetophobia, you can imagine the extra hell that it feels like because I'm terrified of vomiting. It's just unbearable. I also experience stomach pain at night that prevents me from sleeping for ages. I started taking antacids which I believe has now caused me to have diarrhoea. They were helping me get to sleep though. I'm just so lost right now and I can't see a doctor until way after Christmas. It's gotten so bad it's actually making me feel suicidal. Please help!

"Since 2 months I am experiencing constipation. My usual bowel movement is once per day. Due to constipation it is delaying from 2-3 days.  After 3 days if I go to bowel movement, because of the hardness of the bowel sometimes I can see blood and also pain in the anus. But after seeing in the internet, I have opted for enema. After taking enema, for first 2 days it was still painful because of the previous constipation side effects. From day 3, I didn't experience any itchiness or pain in the anus. So I thought enema is helping me. For the next 1 week the bowel movement was healthy without taking enema. After that one day I experienced constipation and started taking enema again. I have been taking it since 3 weeks. The bowel movement is fine. To be exact it is not 100% bowel movement. I can feel it inside. I am happy that there is no itchiness or blood or pain. 
But my concern is that if I take enema daily, do I become dependent on it? Should I consult a doctor? If so whom do I need to contact for these issues? 
Please help me.

"At 20 years old, after two and half years of suffering, I have finally been diagnosed with IBS. Although I still have my doubts.
I had an awful bout of glandular fever that started all the problems off and since then, I have been feeling horrendous. Cannot get through a day without clutching my stomach in pain because of horrendous cramps, having waves of nausea, or having to run to the toilet as soon as I eat. My stomach makes the most awful noises, I frequently have headaches and feel tired and lethargic all the time. I cannot go for an evening out with my friends without having to come home early and I head straight to bed or straight to the toilet. My IBS has stopped me from working for the last month as I am in such agony that some days I can't even walk.
As well as having IBS, I had an endoscopy last year and a specialist diagnosed me with Reflux Oesophagitis. Still never know if I'm spelling that right!
I take 20mg of Omeprazole a day and get through about a bottle of Gaviscon Advance every two weeks and I thought they were helping but now I'm not so sure. I think they help with the Oesophagitis a bit but I want to find something that isn't going to affect me in the long term and something that is natural.
Also I keep finding myself having a number of infections and last week I was on very strong antibiotics for a kidney infection which two weeks ago caused me to scream in pain and collapse in a toilet in Amsterdam (not my finest hour!)
I wake up every day feeling terrible and I can't get my friends and boyfriend to understand. I know it's nothing life threatening but it is ruining my life. I cannot go through every day feeling like this, I am getting so down and I cannot exercise as much as I used to and for a dancer who was dancing about 3 hours every day it is really upsetting.
I do not drink, smoke or do drugs. I don't eat chocolate, eat much fast food or drink caffeine anymore. In fact my diet is so healthy that all my friends poke fun at me and don't understand how I can eat so well!
I've started taking Probiotics, not very strong ones just something to help aid digestion. I used to take them a while ago and they seemed to help.
Going to the doctors over and over to be told there is nothing wrong has been difficult. Finally being given some answers is quite reassuring as for over two years I have been made to feel like a hypochondriac. Even sometimes I would question myself and think it was all in my head. But now I realise that being woken up in the middle of the night by unimaginable cramping pain and feeling sick every single day is not normal.
To top this all off I also embarrassingly struggle with a completely irrational but incredibly terrifying phobia of vomit (Emetophobia). I have had Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Hypnotherapy but unfortunately neither of these have worked! A normal day in my life goes like this; I feel incredibly sick because of my IBS, I then suffer from a panic attack because I am scared I'm going to vomit and I then have awful pains of IBS because the stress of the panic attack has triggered my IBS. A horrible cycle that I can't seem to get myself out of!
I just really don't know where to go from here and I feel so alone sometimes. No one seems to understand and for someone my age and being a girl, it's so embarrassing to have all these combining things. I know the phobia is stupid and I wish I didn't have it but I can't help it and I've tried my best to sort myself out.
Please can someone recommend some natural remedies or advice for anything.
Sorry I've blabbered on for so long, didn't realise how good it would feel writing it all down!
Any advice would be much appreciated.
Thank you!

"Advice needed about joint pain and IBS.
I'm an overweight woman with IBS and diverticular disease. My symptoms are IBS-d mainly but the constipation comes on with the diverticular disease, especially when I'm following FODMAP.
When I have a bad flare up, my body gains a lot of water weight and I become bloated, swollen and gain significant amount of weight. I'm in the middle of a bad flare up but am also experiencing some horrendous joint pain. My knees especially, but also my ankles, wrists and fingers all seem really tight and achey. I mentioned my knees...they hurt when I lie down - like I've bruised them or something - they ache when I sit and they give crack and creak when I walk. They sometimes give way as well when I walk.
I'm 39 and still want to try for a family so I'm reluctant to go to the doc in case it's rheumatoid arthritis and I get put on strong meds. I'm convinced the problem is worse when my IBS symptoms have flared up and, knowing I didn't eat properly at all last month, am hoping the pain reduces now I'm getting my nutrients and taking care of myself.
However, I'm wondering if anyone else is getting these problems and can help me decide whether it is something I should get my doc to look at. On the pain scale, it's probably an even 5 out of 10 throughout the day, but heightened to 7 out of 10 when I start moving.
As usual, thanks in advance for any thoughts on what I should do.

"I'm 23 years old and male.  I have had stomach related problems now for years but it's only been very minor, nothing that ever required me to take a visit to the doctor, until i was about 21.  Since then dependant on what i eat affects how i feel.  Over the last year it has got worse and worse, to the point where i have now cut all dairy and gluten out of my diet, because prolonged amounts give me diarrhea and stomach pains.
I have had a Fecal Occult Blood test, aswell as other blood tests and results came back as totally normal.  I was told i have IBS and given medication for it.  For most of this year i have kept it at bay and put up with it.
However as of October 2015 things have gotten much worse.  I hadn't had any alcohol for around a month and then on 1st October i went out with friends and got very very drunk on vodka.  I woke up the next day and after hangover had faded i felt a pain in my stomach and a pain in my kidney/bladder.
Went to the doctor and they said i had a minor UTI infection so i thought this was the cause of the pain.  After a week infection had cleared up but pain was still there.  Went back to the doctor he said he would book me for an Ultrasound to check my Bladder and Kidneys.   6 week later i Had this scan and sad to say they found nothing wrong with me at all.
This has really upset me because my doctor says my symptoms point to IBS and because of my age and the fact my blood tests are all okay, they won't do further testing.  I want to have a Colonoscopy to be on the safe side but he said there is no point...
I am really confused because this pain i have had has now lasted just over 8 weeks and it is making my life hell.
The pain itself is a stomach pain, which i feel nausea most of the time, cramps and constant dull pain in stomach.  Pain is made worse if i am very hungry and sometimes worse after eating, if i eat too much the pain increases and i feel like i can't stand up it is that bad.
The pain alongside this is also a bladder/kidney type pain it feels like.  I have urges to urinate almost all the time, not once in 8 weeks has it dissapeared.  I am now urinating every 2-3 hours just to get some sort of relief.  Sometimes when i urinate i get a small amount of relief, sometimes though it just adds to the pain for around 10 minutes then settles.  When i am sitting down it feels worse in my stomach/bladder.  I wake up every morning in agony needing to urinate.  I also have a pain under my ribs which is a constant dull ache, so much so that i can no longer sleep on my right side at night

Sad to say this is making me feel very down, i dont know what the solution is, i want to fight this because i fear otherwise it will take over my life until i pray it subsides or goes away!
Should i keep pressuring the doctors for a Colonoscopy? What other tests are available for stomach/kidney/bladder?  Is there a type of CT scan i could have?
I genuinly dont know where to turn too and i have limited knowledge in this subject, so will greatly appreciate any advice from anybody on here!
My diet is alot better than it used to be.  I have lost around 15-20 pounds since October just because my appetite isn't there and i am in pain alot so i try to avoid overeating like i used too.
I take Colofac, but that doesn't seem to do anything so at present i have stopped in the last 2 weeks or so.  I dont want to fix this with pills i want to find out exactly what is wrong with me.
I can handle having IBS but i cant understand why in the last 8 weeks my symptoms went from 3/10 to a solid 8/10 on the pain/discomfort scale overnight.
If anybody has any questions to help me figure this out please go ahead.
I am going back to the Doctor in 2 days so i want too take any suggestions onboard as to what i should do because after my last ultrasound i dont know which direction to go in now.

"Hi all,
I posted previously about not being satisfied with my soon to be IBS diagnosis from my doctor. I'm awaiting an ultrasound to see if there is anything more sinister going on  but I wanted to just list all of my symptoms and some other strange ones too which seem like so much for someone of 27, previous exceptionally fit and healthy to be going through:
Dizziness/lightheaded - Not often - put this down to low blood pressure
abdominal/stomach pains/sensations - daily, but have got better. But can also vary throughout the weeks
Dull upper and lower abdominal aches - Not often
Nausea - Almost daily
Burping - very often throughout the day
Bloating - once every few days
Missed period - not pregnant, checked many times.
Sore throat - this is a new one. 
Ear pain - this has been infrequent but is really bad today and seems like it's connected to my throat
Fullness in rectum - almost daily
Bowel movement - daily, seems normal. If I haven't eaten a lot I'll tend to be constipated.
Wind/bloating - this seems to be every few days but can happen after some meals and isn't overly umcomfortable
As you can see my symptoms are odd. My dietitian said that it's likely IBs and put me on this list of foods to avoid and also said it's likely I have acid reflux. I'm 27 and have not had a bad diet, in fact I'm underweight. Why would I all of a sudden suffer from acid reflux?

"I am now 72 years old and have lived the diagnosis of a lazy bowel given to me when I was 19 years old. The problem was each bowel movement only produced very small hard movements akin to sheep or goat droppings! My specialist instructed me to eat plenty of fibre and greens. Since at that time our diets consisted of regular bowels of porridge and greens with out meals I shrugged and put up with the condition. At around mid-thirties crippling attacks of anul cramps which reduced me to tears were finally relieved with a prescription of colofac anti spasmodics and I finally realized that if I avoided processed bread and could track down sweetcorn bread then I was must better and had fewer attacks of the neverending cycle of constipation or diarrhoea. During this period I had found it impossible to become pregnant although there was no apparant cause and my husband and I adopted a child. At age fifty three having gone through the menopause without problem I was diagnosed with endemetriosis and finally told why I had never been able to conceive. How medicine has moved on! Apart from the bread, Beans and white sugar I gave up which made life intolerable if I ate them I persevered with my favourite foods and hoped to develop a tolerance. Unfortunately now I find increasing foodstuffs such as onion, mushroom, cauliflower, cabbage and broccolli cause me such discomfort over a period of several days it is just not worth the bother!! I wonder now how much worse this intolerance will become? I should say that from age 55-65 years I took part in bowel cancer prevention trials and had intensive screening which fortunately did not reveal any problems with the colon. I should not complain because I am generally speaking very healthy I would just like to hear from anyone who has had a similar problem for this length of time and secondly, can this continued irritation of the bowel cause worse damage?

"I'm nearly positive I have IBS as I match several symptoms. Sometimes I'll have diarrhea for 3 weeks constantly, and other times I'll be constipated, along with other symptoms like abdominal pain.
These past few weeks have been way worse though with nearly constant pain in my right side altenating with my stoamch and left pelvic area. I've also seen a lot fo changes in bowel movements. I've been having about 6-7 per day for awhile and they range from really thin and long to looking like shredded diarrhea (TMI, I know). Somtimes I'll have normalish bowel movements too, and all of this will happen within on day. I've also has occasional mucous and blood on the toilet apper although no pain that would indicate a tear. A few times my bowel movements have been a gry color, but that's only happened a couple of times. It's becomming a real hassle as I live in a sorority and have to share a bathroom with four stalls and I'm a bit shy about that, which really sucks. I saw the doctor earlier in the year because I was feeling really full after hardly eating then getting really nauseous at night, but we tested for gluten intolerance because I thought that was most likely and there was none. 
I'm thinking maybe some stress has excacerbated it, I can't really think of anything in particular but I know it's a possibility. The thing it, I'm a 19 year olf female college student and I don't want to go get tested if it's not neccesary. Due to my age I doubt it's anything other than IBS but I'm pretty confident it doesn't have a cure, right? So should I get tested just in case they can help or it's something other than IBS, or should I just ignore it and hope goes back to my usual patterns? I don't want to seem like a hypochondriac as I've already been seen by the doctors for otehr issues, and there's only one. I also assume, due to my age, they'd just automatcially assume it's IBS and do no testing so is it worth it to see the doctor?

"Hi All
Recently been diagnosed with IBS but looking for confirmation of this and hoping someone can help. Here are a list of my symptoms and frequency they occur:
Headaches - Not often
Dizziness - Not often
Feeling faint - Not often
Elevated heart rate - Occasionally
Sharp stabbing pains (upper and lower abdomen, chest, ribs, back) - Almost daily
Dull upper and lower abdominal aches - Not often
Nausea - Almost daily
Burping, Flatulence and Bloating - Daily
Weight loss - Ongoing but has slowed a lot lately
Lathargy - Daily
Fast food transit time and undigested food - Daily
Gurgling and Churning sounds upper and lower abdomen - Daily (lots)
Tender / sore feeling abdomen (upper and lower) - Often
Shortness of breath - Often
Hot flushes or cold chills - Not often
Loose or diarrhoea like bowel movement - Only occur once per day
From this list is the diagnosis of IBS likely to be correct or could there be another cause for this. I believe a lot of the pain is due to an access production and build up of wind / gas, so any advice on how to subdue this production of gas / wind would be greatly appreciated. I have had allsorts of blood tests done, all come back negative or have borderline results, faecal elastase was fine, abdominal ultrasound was fine, Endoscopy and Colonoscopy were ok (only needed polyp removal). All my problems started from a reaction to taking Naproxen, which left me experiencing severe upper abdominal pain. I believe that I had stomach ulcer(s) prior to taking Naproxen (bowel movements were dark and tarry, but since on Omeprazole they aren't anymore), I also wonder if the Naproxen has caused Pancreatitis which I have read can happen as well. I am a bit of a stress head and I am pretty sure I suffer anxiety, which has been made worse since experiencing these symptoms as I have no idea why this is happening, and can't help but think the worse, even though I know it probably isn't as bad as I think. I was the picture of health a year ago, and now I suffer all the symptoms above, which is affecting my ability to lead a normal life.
Any advice, info or comments on this would be greatly welcomed.

"First apologies for a long post, and thanks for everyone who cares to read. I have been having problems with my gut for 1 1/2 years now and don't even know where to look for answers anymore.
I am 28 and normal weight. Previously I never had any problems with my gut. I never cared too much about my diet, ate anything I fancied and rarely got ill. In fact I even complained that I couldn't burp. When I had a few pints I would feel bloated, full of air but couldn't burp.
Then 1 1/2 years ago I had a 24 tummy bug and after that it all started. When it cleared away I kept feeling nauseous all day. I started burping a lot and felt unwell every day.
After trying different medications that did not work I cut out gluten which helped to ease the symptoms a lot. But now 1 1/2 years the symptoms are still there, on and off they are getting worse and better. I cannot relate it to anything in particular and can't make out when and why it is going to hit me.
Symptoms
I have identified a cycle of symptoms: It starts in the morning when I feel very weak, and light-headed, like I am going to faint any second and also nauseous some times. but it means that I am hungry. When I then eat, I start burping a lot. In bad phases I timed one burp every minute for hours. It is just air, no acid, it is more of a gurgling that comes from the tummy and then air comes up. My tummy gurgles and rumbles all the time too.
When I cannot burp (for example in a meeting) I start feeling very nauseous. A few occasions where the tummy started cramping and I got all shaky as if I was about to throw up, but nothing has ever happened!! I don't get bad tummy pains or constipation & diarrhoea.
The only other thing that happened over the years is that my digestion has changed. Before I used to eat very little and have bowel movements like once every 2-3 days. Now I eat a lot, like all the time so I don't faint and have bowel movements at least once but up to 4 times a day. But I am not sure if that is related to not eating gluten maybe, not gained or lost weight either.
I have had all my bloods done. HPlori test and an upper abdomen scan. All turned out fine, they found a gallstone about 3mm thick but said it was too little to do any harm. I have tried all sorts of different anti-acids stomach tablets travel sickness and ""IBS over the counter medicine"" but nothing really helped. The doctor says it's IBS but I am not convinced. How can it come so suddenly from no symptoms to gurgling and burping all day long? And how is it that nothing seems to influence it?
Over the passed year I have changed my diet quite a lot but nothing seemed to have affected it at all:
- Cut out gluten strictly (if I accidentally eat it symptoms get really bad)
- Reduced dairy intake
- Stopped smoking
- Stopped drinking alcohol
- Stopped drinking fruit juices and fizzy drinks (just plain water nowawdays)
- Cut down greasy and fatty food
- Cut down sugar and salt

"i started to get symptoms of IBS when i got really stressed over going back to college, i went to the doctors and like most peoples stories they didnt do much to help. the anti spazams they gave me seemed to have made the pain worse, over time i learnt to deal with it, if i went out i had to know of every toilet there was before i left the house, it effected me working. just as i got used to it i fell pregnant and all my symptoms disappeared. i thought i had solved the problem. now my little boy has been born all my symptoms have come back, the pain, the urgent need to go toilet but not actually going. nothing was helping me.
so what i want to do is pass on my information onto everyone else just in the hope that i might be able to help at least one more person.. i started to work for a company called forever living, (purely because my partner couldnt efford all ours bill on his own and his business wasnt doing so well) i was recommended by a friend. but what i didnt know was the benefits of working for this company and the benefits its products it would have on me and so many other people with IBS. so as starting i researched the products and found that one of the products called forever Aloe vera gel actually helps people like me with IBS, and it does. so many people have recommneded this product to other and so on. so if there is anyone out there that has given up searching for help or would like to try the product please message me for more information your not alone! and its worth a try!

"Hi, my IBS symptoms started 2 1/2 months ago just before my wedding (I was extremely stressed!) They started off as mild diarrhoea and occasional sharp pains on the lower right side if my abdomen, which caused me initially to think it might be my appendix. However, when nothing more serious developed I decided to wait until after the wedding and visit my GP.
Following blood tests my GP said everything seemed fine and diagnosed me with IBS. My symptoms seem to flare up if I am having a stressful day (which I realise is quite common) and range from bloating (particularly after my evening meal), quite bad gas, occasional diarrhoea but the most irritating problem is the weird twinges I get (mainly on the right lower side, although this can vary slightly - today its just under my bellybutton!) The pain is mild and like a twingy stinging sensation, its also sometines tender to touch?
I realise my symptoms are very mild and I am extremely lucky, but I was just wondering if anyone else has these twingy pains just to put my mind at rest really?

"HI Everyone!
 By way of introduction i am Humza, 24, Male and would like to seek expertise on my situation.
I have been eating lot of junk food from outside until I was around 96-98 KG and realised i need to eat healthy food and reduce weight, Since then i stopped all the spicy/junk food along with carbonated drinks and caffeine. To reduce weight i did extensive cardio for few months until i was 75-78 kg.
 I changed my lifestyle and because of it had to face some issues which included constipation, heart palpitations at night and food coming to mouth (sometime after eating). Therefore, I had to elevate my bed before sleeping which helped a little to avoid palpitations but constipation still continued.
 In order to cure constipation i relied a lot on lactulose and recently i decided to quit on lactulose so that my stomach should work naturally. So far it has been 3 weeks without any laxative and i have been taking a lot of fiber (avocado, papaya, prunes etc) with around 2-3 liters of water every day.
 Below are the symptoms that i face now:
- Constipation (though fibre helped to empty 15-20% of everyday bowel but i guess it will take time)
- Sudden fast heart beat specially at night ( i remember going to doctor once, he checked blood pressure and did ECG, apparently everything was fine)
- Developed certain allergy causing runny nose and sneezing (not sure what triggers it but most likely it is due to dust)
- food coming to mouth sometime after eating
- Number pinky fingers of both hands usually at the time of sleep and in morning
- A lot of underarm sweating during the early day time
 I tried taking Omeprazole 20mg but apparently it is increasing heart palpitations
 Surprisingly, I do not have heartburn or any pain in the stomach.
 I look forward for your expertise and guidance
Thanks,
Humza

"I have suffered this awful syndrome now for 15 years and I have to say it has in many ways put great pressure on my life, I am unable to hold down my job as it is so unpredictable.  I feel the medical profession just doesn't understand how bad this syndrome can be and is often swept under the carpet.  I am unable to eat dairy at all, not even a tiny bite of a pizza can send me running to the loo.  We have no control over stress, we cannot make ourselves deal with stress we deal with it how we have to and unintentionally this causes the attacks to come on.  I find the attacks excrutiating, i've birthed 2 chldren naturally and the cramps are no different to the contractions felt in childbirth, only in childbirth you are given major pain relief, IBS I take Buscopan and have to wait 20 minutes for it to work, the longest 20 minutes of my life I can tell you!  I cannot sit, I cannot stand all I can do is lay and if this happens in my workplace as it has once before I am stuck at work unable to get home.  I can honestly say my IBS is a huge black hole in my life, one I will never get over just have to live with day to day.  I get so fed up with it I don't eat at all, probably making it worse but I will go days without eating, almost punishing myself for what its done to me.  If anyone has any great ideas on how they manage their's, I would love to hear from you.

I have been diagnosed with IBS-d and diverticular disease. I'm confident with the diagnosis as I've had all the tests. But IBS-d is managed by FODMAP diet, yet this cuts out so many sources of fibre that the flare ups are most likely the diverticulitis...massive bloating, cramping and diarrhoea.

"Hi, 
I've seen an NHS dietitian and she has advised that I avoid legumes/beans due to their skins being an irritant to the gut. As a vegetarian for ten years who has been able to tolerate such foods (and depended on them) for a very long time this is quite a sad and sudden prospect.
Has anybody else had a sudden intolerance to beans/legumes and is there anything in this family you can tolerate? Do you have any advice? Do you think this could be incorrect advice even?
I haven't yet been diagnosed with ibs and I have to follow this avoidance diet for three weeks to even see if there is a change so I guess I'm just feeling a bit anxious over how I'm going to get my protein in this time. I don't want to replace this with processed quorn. Plus I guess I'm just in denial about beans being a cause of some of my digestive issues of late. 
For the record, I have had issues with nausea and did have issues with cramps and bloating which seems to have dissipated somewhat in the last month. I've had some acid reflux but this has nearly gone. Also if I was going to lean one way it would ibs-c but bowel movements have been regular albeit with some constipation infrequently. 
Thanks in advance.

"Hi everyone, for about 20 years I have suffered mild stomach aches and a bloated feeling on & off which my GP said was IBS.
for the last 2 months my symptoms have been a lot worse with typical symptoms being mainly constipation but also very loose/watery stools on one or two days a week, constant mild to moderate pain that can be anywhere in my abdomen but mostly low down, constant rumbling & bubbling noises coming from my abdomen. Every day it seems bad but seems to be worse on days I have a bowel movement which is about every other day.
Most days it feels as if I have a badly upset stomach or food poisoning.
So far I have tried Buscopan, Colefac and peppermint oil caps. but nothing seems to help, I am half way through a 12 week course of probiotic drink but not helping so far.
I have also been suffering a bit of streets/mild anxiety lately.

"hello I have had 2 bouts of diarrhoea recently and on both occasion had no bowel opening for 4/5 days afterwards. I am currently trying to lose weight. On the morning before the fist bout of diarrhoea I weighed myself and had lost a couple of pounds. Every time I weigh myself now even though I am strictly following my reduced calorie intake and noting down everything I eat as well as exercising I seem to have gained between 3-4lb. My clothes feel looser and I feel like I have lost weight but the scales say otherwise. Is it possible that this supposed weight gain is due to the absence of bowel movements since I had diarrhoea? I feel really depressed about the situation as I am working so hard to shift the extra weight and there seems to be no logical explanation for why the scales indicate I have gained.

"Looking for advice from fellow ibs sufferers, this may seem long but I'm desperate. It's regarding my 7yr son who from day 1 he was born has always had problems with bowels. I knew then at 3 days old he was not right but eventually it took 3 yrs for someone to actually listen that he was lactose intolerant. But still changing his dairy products he still struggles with bowel movements. I've tried the dr so many times and dietician and they just palm me off with laxatives for him to take constantly. His stools are alternate from loose throthy, to dry and firm or constipated. Stools can change within 6hrs and colour of stools. Also there is sometimes fat in stools and loads of undigested food. He also suffers bad breath all the time. We also tried a gluten free diet for 10 days where we did see an improvement in bowel habit. He not intolerant to any foods as we had a blood test done yrs ago and antibodies came back negative.he now been referred to the peadatrician to do a blood test for coeliac. And stool test for imflamation bowel. But dr said it's going to come back clear even though he has not done his test yet. And he seems not bothered. My son has servere speech delay so he can't tell me when he feels rough but he does have mood swings and we notice all the times his constipated he gets aggressive until he does a loose poo. He also falls asleep at school for a couple of days maybe once every couple of mths. Also he can't digest Apple, cabbage, peppers. Cooked carrot. 
does this sound like ibs or am I going crazy. How can I get through to the dr to listen.

"Hello all I'm 46 years old. For about 3 years I get a rather nasty upper abdominal pain while eating fatty foods (burgers, Fried chicken some kebabs and fish & chips certain other rather unhealthy foods. The pain is is central and near breastbone area . It is severe enough to make me stop eating and possible go for a short walk until it subsides which will happen within a few minutes. I'm not sure you'd describe it as burning pain or not , it possibly has am element of burning in it.
As far as eating all other foods , roasts lamb, beef , chicken etc , steaks no problem at all.
I will add that as a prelude to these pains for quite a few years leading up to the pains I was binge drinking a couple of times a week. That has all stopped now. Has anyone else experienced this. I just though I'd add that I've tried anti acids without any change.

"Hi,
I've been having some strange things going on recently and many trips to the docs. Blood work is all fine (iron, coeliac, liver, thyroid etc) although I am awaiting an ultrasound scan of my stomach and pelvis, ovarian cancer blood test and a gastorentology appointment. I'm 27, just FYI. 
Here are my symptoms. For the last several weeks I have had nausea (sporadically), some stomach cramping, back ache, acid reflux, bloating, dizziness, headaches (worse on waking), strange feelings in ears and generally just feeling very rubbish. Often things improve as soon as I eat only to return an hour or so later. It's got better since the first week this started but I'm certainly not back to 100%.
So, the doc thinks I might be finally dignaosed with ibs but my symptoms don't seem typical with ibs (e.g. the diarrhea and constipation). I haven't had any change in bowel movements, in fact they've even got better and more regular as I've been eating a lot more to try to build up my strength. I didn't used to eat much prioer to all of this if I'm honest. 
It seems like my symptoms are like a roulette as I'll never know how I'll feel one day to the next. If I'm honest it's really getting me down and has completely changed my outlook. I don't feel like the same person and I'm scared to go out and socialise as often it seems if I go out and have a couple of drinks I'll get cramping and then feel hideous the next day. I used to drink more and feel fine so this is very unusual. 
Anyway, any insight would be very much appreciated. I feel like I'm going out of my mind. 
Thanks in advance

"Hi there
Just thought I'd add my say to this debate! I've had IBS for about 7 yrs now, it just came out of the blue. I mainly suffer from bloated stomach (I look 6 months pregnant sometimes) which may stay like that for a whole week, day and night, and also I get really bad stomach pains, almost like contractions (I've had 2 kids!!) so know the pain. Also lots of wind, burping, and some diarrohea, but not much. I find that it never matters what I eat, eg: i can have a sunday roast one sunday, be ok, then the next sunday, I'll eat the same, and have to rush to the loo cos I have bad diarrhoea, so hey, I dont know where I stand with it! I go gym 3 times a week, but this doesnt help one bit. I only take Colpermin or peppermint tablets, but they dont help one bit. I'm wondering if anyone takes anti depressants and if so, if they help? It is getting to the point where it is taking over my life, I get it about 4/5 days each week, mainly wind, pains and now and again, a whole week of bloating, which can ruin a saturday night out!!!
Anyhow, I hope someone can advise which they have found to be useful for the pain really, and bloating? Hope someone can help!! Think I'll make another visit to the doctor hey!

I was in constant pain, stomach always churning and bowel movements all over the place. My doctors ruled out the serious stuff and just said it must be IBS. They gave me buscopan tablets (84 a month!) and they do nothing for me. 
Anyway. about a year ago i started getting blood in my stool, fresh red blood which made me panic, the doctors said it's probably piles or an anal fissure. But these have been happening every few weeks now. It can't be normal to eperience this much rectal bleeding at 22 surely?

"Hello. I have recently been diagnosed with IBS, but my main symptoms are not so much the spasms / pain, but a nasty cough associated with acid reflux, and the sore throat that goes with it. It is worse in the mornings, and if I lean forward. Eating / talking / stress also bring it on more. Does anyone else have this, and, if so, does anyone know if Mebeverine helps with this too, or is it just the spasms that it helps ?

"Just wondering how many of you have nausea as your main symptom on IBS? I've been undergoing diagnosis since June when I suddenly started having issues with D associated with severe nausea. I don't really get pain, but do get discomfort in one area on the right (where I'm convinced I can feel a harder lump like area but scans all clear so Dr thinks it's muscle as it is only when standing that I can feel it), plus lots of gas etc. The Dr also thinks I have functional dyspepsia but I have no other symptoms, such as heartburn but do end up quite burpy. I feel OK for weeks and then feel horrendous and can't eat so lose weight, which is scary as I'm pretty tiny anyway (7 1/2 stone and drop to 7 or just under when I lose). Plus i have hwalth anxiety about cancer.
Ladies I've also noticed the Nausea tends to kick in a few days before my period or around ovulation which again makes me suspicious of the diagnosis. Also it's worse in the morning (and no definitely not pregnant lol).
All scans (2x US), bloods and stool tests plus a flex sig clear. Will be insisting on full endo and colonoscopy to put my mind at rest.
But yes, nausea as main symptom anyone? Especially round period time? Any tips to alleviate? Anti Nausea mens not helping much, ginger helps when mild but not severe. Peppermint makes the gas worse.

"Hi all
I've been reading the forums on and off for a while since my symptoms started up and I've seen how supportive a place they can be. I must admit I'm struggling at the moment.
Back in May, I was getting some pelvic pain and went off to the GP with it. She didn't think much of it and said it was probably normal female pains. Then in June I had a bit of an episode one night where I felt suddenly very nauseous and dizzy and ended up having explosive D. I spent the next week feeling awful. I went back to the doc and she did a pelvic exam and said all she could feel was a normal follicular cyst on my right ovary. But from that moment she pressed on that right side I've had discomfort there. I'm convinced that side of my abdomen is harder but the GP (and I've seen several since can feel nothing untoward). Sometimes the area hurts when I pass a harder BM of if I bend or lift my leg. It's by no means excruciating but I am aware of it.
Since June my bowel movements have been consistently looser and I've had a couple of instances where I've had urgent and watery diarrhea for up to a week. Combined with feeling horrendously nauseous and unable to eat and having aches and pains all over and awful fatigue. I've obviously lost weight at those times. I'm only 7st 7 as it is and lost over half a stone. I have been eating to gain and have almost gained it all back.
I've had a battery of blood tests, an ultrasound, stool tests and a flex sig (normal biopsies), and nothing has shown anything unusual except for visible inflammation during the flex sig. I've seen a GI specialist who explained that this was likely due to the bowel prep. I'm due another ultrasound this week to specifically look at this right side area but the Dr's all seem convinced it's IBS brought on by stress and a potential GI infection in June.
I however cannot seem to convince myself that it's nothing more serious. The diagnostic process has been so slow and I've felt so unheard at times that I've gotten myself so worked up about it. I've gotten myself onto a CBT course for the anxiety, but was wondering does this sound like IBS to you all?
I switched up my diet hugely (not that it was at all bad before but i did eat quite a lot of grains etc as a veggie) and i hope this has helped. I now wake quite gassy, I pass one loose-ish stool a day sometimes with a little mucus. I occasionally get tummy pains and bloating and gas if I eat something that doesn't agree but that is rare. The most persistent issues seems to be the loose-ish stool, right sided discomfort and occasional and horrendous nausea.
Sorry for the long post. Just new to this all and needing any support, reassurance or advice you can give me. Thanks in advance. Xx

Firstly the key prerequisite is the gurgling intestines and quite a lot of wind, On the days I have D I sometimes notice a slightly bitter taste in my mouth which clears after D. The weirdest thing is that the D when it happens has a smell about it. Dr's ask if your stools smell more repugnant than usual when you have D, mine don't they just have this chemical smell to them, I know the smell, I've smelt it before somewhere but for the life of me I cant remember where . I can only describe it as a chemical smell. I've included my observation here as I was wondering if it is my own bile acids which have this strange chemical odour?

 Can anybody help me with good substitutes or recipes for family favourites?. I can't afford to cook 2 dinners, my last flare up was cause by us getting skint and not being able to avoid wheat food as wheat free is so expensive.
ive found plenty of recipes but they're all a bit random.

"It's a month now, it all started with stomach cramps on the right bottom of my abdomen/pelvic area and constipation. Then the costipation have been coming and going every 3/4 days together with the cramps, sometimes sharp fast pain just under the belly area on right side (stabbing). Sometimes I also had the sharp pain (like stabbing) when trying to have a bowel movement. The gp had me do blood test, celiac disease test, pelvic ultrasounds, lower abdomen ultrasounds and x-rays but it was all ok. She said it had to be IBS but 3 days ago I was so sick ( I felt nauseous, pressure builting on lower right abdomen, sharp pains and a stinging feeling near the navel) so I went to emergency, they did blood test and a pelvic exam...all clear no problems found. Now, in the last week I also had pain in the lower back, kinda like back pain but more mild and yesterday, I was nauseous for about 2-3 hours and then the pain shifted to the left side of the lower abdomen and it have been there since then. I wonder if instead of IBS it could be a parcial occlusion that have been slowly moving in my intestin. Please let me know what you think about it.

They thought I had crohn's but know I suspect gall bladder since I got the back pain and diarreha get's worse when I eat things that worsen gall bladder symtoms. Too coincidental I think. The MRI showed small stones and contracted gall bladder. Plus the duct from the gall bladder is collapsed.

"Hey, so I'm a 21 year old female- never had any health problems, always been active. About 3 weeks ago I started getting problems with my stomach/lower abdomen. Basically what has been happening is that I've been getting stomach aches, and getting acidic feelings from stuff I've eaten making it kind of hard- and sometimes I've had heartburn, as well as diarrhea pretty much this entire time. On top of that I get this sort of pressure (the feeling is hard to explain) in my lower abdomen, like as if it was my bladder/uterus. All this started happening before I got my period, which I assumed was because of it (normally I have stomach issues during it). Nonetheless, I wasn't sure what it was at first, so I went to the doctor. He told me that it was just a stomach virus that has been going around lately, and gave me some medication for the acidity and ""spasms"" etc and told me I just had to wait it out. He also said that the pressure in my lower area could be something else- so I went to a gynecologist. He checked my uterus and said everything was normal, so thats not a part of the problem. Now it's almost been a week since my period is over, and I'm still feeling the aches, acidity, and the pressure. I've tried everything to soothe it, eating ginger, yogurt, drinking green tea... etc. So thats why I decided to post on here, to see if anyone had any ideas as to what I might do/what it is ? I talked to a family member about this and she said it might be IBS, but idk. I'm trying to wait it out before deciding to see another doctor about this. I've already spent alot of money having to go to two doctors and for the medication too.
Thank you !! I'm just so frustrated and ready to feel 100% again.

"I hope someone can help!
To give some background first I had open surgery for appendicitis in 2001 and since then my stomach has never been the same. In 2011 I had severe adhesions and a CT scan showed that I had bowel loops also - was never explained what that meant. 2014 in January I had surgery on a spagellian hernia on the left side of my abdomen.
Since January this year I have had discomfort in my lower left abdomen and doctors have put it down to IBS. They have me buscopan and meveberine that didn't really help - just upset my stomach more.
(My bowel movements are as soon as I wake and the. A rush to the loo about 20 minutes later) that to me is normal.
Anyway, I have been admitted twice to hospital this year due to being so uncomfortable and concerned and they said I had classic diverticulosis and they sent me for CT scan. This was clear no problem but the discomfort is still there. They have me now for colonoscopy in a few weeks
Lately have been suffering from acid reflux constantly however not been to doctor yet as getting fed up of going. Lansazprozole and omeprozole don't seem to do much. Also an itchy bottom
Just wondered if this does sound like IBS as it starting to do my head in. Mind runs away with all sorts of possibility.

"I have had morning diarrhoea for ever. Usually between 4-6 am it begins, then 2-3 times before brekfast. It used to be 5 times a day but I've given up wheat which helps somewhat. Probiotics used to help, but seem to have no effect now.
my doctor think I may have proctocolitis, I'm waiting for a sigmoidoscopy, and after a bad flare up caused me to get a haemorrhoid I was given prednisone cream, and I swear it took me down to 1-2 BM s a day. It really seemed to calm things down. When I stopped using it after a week I'm right back to guts churning, diarrhoea, gas. I don't know what to think. I'm sure I do have IBS but could it be both? I've made an appointment to ask for a more targeted form of steroid, even though I don't have a diagnosis yet.
unutl recently I was taking a couple of codeine before bed due to a pain condition, and that gave me till maybe 7am but still diarrhoea but the pain has improved so I stopped taking them, and now I'm back to getting up at 4-6 am. 
Does this sound like proctocolitis? Anybody else had both? I'm guessing ibs could cause proctocolitis when you're pooping so many times a day.

"Hi all, hope that title kind of makes sense. Basically, I started having stomach trouble a few months back e.g. Yellow coloured stools, occasional abdominal pain, acid, nausea in the morning somtimes and lots of bloating. This occured during a pretty stressful time in my life and i found that these symptoms would flare up when I was stressed or anxious about something. I've had blood tests done which came back clear and a stool test which came back clear, too. Doctor told me he thinks it's my IBS back (I had it when I was around 12 and then it seemed to subside until I turned 20 a few months back) and has put me on Colofac. The tablets seemed to have really helped me, I have a huge appetite, I don't bloat up much and my stools seem seldom normal, I just have mild constipation but stools are not hard to pass at all. Sometimes they are a paler colour but nothing really abnormal. I still get occasional twinges in my stomach but I figured who doesn't? I also get a slight bit of discomfort under my left rib cage (like there is a blockage or ball of gas) and stomach rumbling sometimes. I was wondering, as I am obsessed with health and live in constant fear of cancer, would cancer symptoms ease up on it's own/through tablets or would those symptoms be persistant and gradually getting worse? 
I know this is very long winded and symptoms may not seem too serious but i love peace of mind and hate obsessing over this stuff! Would love to hear your opinions.
Kind Regards,

"I've been posting about my stomach problems in this thread https://patient.info/forums/discuss/not-just-ibs-pain--478302?page=0&order=Oldest but a question maybe one of you can answer.
I've been consistently ill for 3 months with abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea and nausea. I haven't had any 'good' days, though I've had particularly 'bad' days. 
I'm barely eating aInd have lost weight - I'm now just under 6.5 stone. Somedays, I can manage maybe one meal a day. The pain is there even when I don't eat.
What I'm wondering is if anyone else has suffered a flare up that's lasted as long as 3 months? Is this normal? When I was diagnosed with IBS, I was ill for a month. 
I'm going to Canada at the end of November, to represent Diabetes UK, but there are days at the moment where I feel that if I'm as ill as I am now, I won't be able to go. THIS IS NOT AN OPTION FOR ME!
I've tried peppermint tea, capsules, prescribed medicines, and more recently, probiotics. Nothing helps. 
Any input you have is much appreciated.

I got pregnant 4 weeks after having my son the diarrhea started add to the weakened sphincter muscle I cannot always make it to the bathroom. That was 29 years ago. After 10 years I finally went to a gastro and she tried the sigmoid scope but my insides were to small and twisted so they had to knock me out to do the colonoscopy found I had a very large pre cancerous polyp to remove it they had to take a fairly large section of my colon out. Now add to the weak sphincter, now the ibsd and add scar tissue in the intestinal track. Try working I worked retail you don't know how many times I had to leave work because I couldn't make it to the back of the store to the bath room. Talking about embarrassing.

I was diagnosed with diabetes 8 years ago and boy these 2 issues are not compatible. So as I told my doctor one day I eat for the diabetes the next for ibs. If I eat what's good for the diabetes the ibsd flares sometimes bad, if I eat for the ibsd the sugar wigs out. Yes they put me on Bentyl never done a dang thing for me. I try to go about living the best I can but I will say this I've been embarrased more than once, and if I eat something I know might set me off I don't leave the house.

Not diarrhea, and then after that just the constant feeling that I have to go.  I had knee surgery 3 years ago, and was given Vicoden.  My whold life changed.  It stopped the pain and crampy feeling I felt after I have a BM. It also took away that I have to go feeling.  I have taken it on and off for a few years.  Never got addicted, I was given it for neck and back pain.  But, no gastro or regular doc will give it to you for IBS.  So now I take Xanax and a 1/2 of Immodium Multi Symptom tablet.  It's just exhausting..I get a lot of gas build up, sometimes I am nauseous, lower right side pain, upper, left side. Drives me crazy. I have had two colonoscopies, 2 endoscopies, pelvic sonogram, and go to my gyno every year.  But are all these aches and pains normal? the nausea normal?  giving me lots of anxiety and depression. Any advice is welcomed

"Hi,
I have IBS for many years. Veru bad symptoms.
After having done all possible exams you can imagine (colonoscopy, videocapsule...), I just made a test 3 weeks ago which found that I have fructose intolerance with SIBO.
I have treatment with Fungizone and Triflucan.
Everyone experienced that ? any results ?
Or how did you manage to get rid of it ? (i don't eat fructose in food, and I a gluten intolerant)
Thanks

"I have had IBS symptoms for many years and currently on a Fodmap diet with a NHS dietician. This diet does seems to help. However, I am waiting for an appointment for a further scan as I suspect I have a small intestine obstruction most likely a bezoar. I vomit and feel full especially when I eat solid protein. It doesn't seem to digest.  Occasionally I feel large hard marbles in my belly. I have tried strong digestive enzymes which haven't helped. The nausea is really terrible and I searched for alternative treatments. It seems there is some medical literture which suggests that coca cola effectively dissolves these undigested masses. Has anyone had any experience using coca cola? I don't  drink it at all.

"I had my gallbladder removed at end of April because I had gallstones.
Although I now do not have pain in my right side very often as I had with gallstones things are still not really settling down.
I had to have Dr to me at weekend and ended up going to Emergency Assessment unit at hospital as she thought it might be appendicits.
Dr at hospital said it was faecal impaction (bad constipation) and sent me home with laxatives.Next day I went to bathroom several times and was just running though mostly very watery stuff. I spoke to another Dr on Monday evening who said to stop taing laaxatives as they had obviously done their job.

"I'm not sure if I've had my worst flare of IBS or food poisoning?
I woke up, I'd had a sore tummy prior, cramps and gas.
But when I went to the toilet i was in awful pain like someone was stabbing my insides with a hot poker stick.  
Only three tiny poops came out full of mucus.
Then about 30 minutes later after I ate, I had a full on attack, I had to run to the bathroom, it wasn't diaherroa but it was thin snake like poop and lots of it but the cramps were killing me, I was sweating, and sore, I couldn't breathe.  Then after about 30 minutes I felt I could hop of the toilet then after eating a plain banana - it happened all over again, terrible cramps, snake like poop.  Yesterday was one of the worst days I've ever experienced, I then had an awful headache, and couldn't eat for fear of explosive poop.
I managed to eat rice and a baked potato for dinner with no ill effect.
Does this sound like IBS?
I went to the Dr and of course he's perplexed.
He said could be IBS could be food poisoning!
Not sure what will happen today as I've just woken up - going to eat rice for breakfast and maybe I should cut back on the coffee and bread oh and pasta.
Anyone experienced anything similiar?
I'm at my wits end with IBS!
Thank you x

"I was diagnosed with IBS a few years ago, had a colonoscopy which was described as challenging because of excessive looping and adhesions from a hysterectomy. Couldn't get down the last part of the colon, wanted me to have a barium colonoscopy to do that but passed it up as I was done being poked and prodded.
anyway, I have nearly always had D - IBS, the pain from it is horrific, but this year not had as many flare ups as I discovered my main trigger foods seem to be vegetables and some fruits...Also a high fibre diet despite what my dr said made me worse as well. Cutting fibre out almost completely actually regulated me better...Oddly enough I took up drinking wine to cope with depression and other health issues and weirdly I find it seems to calm my IBS and does help it. Am I alone in that? By all accounts I read alcohol should be a trigger but drinking two or three glasses a night does help more so than any medication.
well now I have another problem, have in the past week started to experience constant urge to go. Also feels like and I'm sorry for this, but it feels like someone shoved a golf ball in the back door.
pass a couple of normal stools, feeling goes away but less than hour later feeling is back and pass another couple of stools and so it goes on. Don't believe I'm constipated as I do eventually pass a lot.
last week I was amazed as I was going as regular as a clock, knew it was too good to last. Nothing has changed diet wise.
i try not to strain, mainly out of pure fear as I have a urethral prolapse caused by years of no hrt and straining pushes it out and causes haemorrhaging of it. I should get that treated but after what my g.p said last year to me I don't think I will ever trust a doctor again not to humiliate me.
is constant urge and passing little and often a symptom? Also the feeling of having something inside your bottom like a golf ball.? Taking mebeverine.

"Ok this is strange...
A few weeks ago I had to have a 1 week course of penicillin to clear up a bad throat infection.
Now my Ibs seems to have gone? I have managed to start eating foods that I know irritate me, and have been ok. I drank fizzy drink and been ok. I'm having fairly normal bowel movements and all this weird stomach noise, heavy heartbeat, feeling sick after certain foods all seems to have gone and I feel ok. I've reintroduced gluten in my diet and seem to be coping with it ok.
I'm keeping a balanced diet and will see how things go. I've started taking digestion enzymes to try and help and recovery / healing of the gut? Not sure whether I would benefit from probiotics as I don't feel I need them at the moment.
I'm a bit confused atm as I don't know what's happened or why? Either way i do not want to go back feeling the way I was for +4 years!

"I am so fed up and depressed with feeling unwell all the time. I will have upper abdominal pain (3/4 inches above my belly button) that will last from getting up in the morning to going to bed at night. This has been going on constantly for the last 7/8 months and is starting to affect my working/home life. I am constantly exhausted with no energy; I pick up any bugs/viruses/colds and cannot get rid of them for ages.  I have always suffered with acid reflux and usually take omperazole (1 x 20mg tablet in the morning) However this dosent seem be helping me anymore. I do not vomit as much as I used to, but when I do it burns my throat really bad, it feels like I am vomiting very hot water/bile. Recently my bowel movements have been light coloured and sometimes almost yellow, I am regular on the toilet and will suffer pain in my abdomen after a bowel movement.
I have been to see my doctor and he did an abdominal exam and diagnosed me with IBS and prescribed me Mebervrene, these did not help me at all. I went back to my Doctor and he did a full blood count, a stool test for H-pylori. The blood test came back all clear apart from slightly raised liver count (doctor said nothing to worry about) and my stool test was all clear. I went to my doctors again 2 weeks later and explained I was still no better; he asked if I was still taking omperazole & Mebervrene, I said yes, he said I should not be getting any pain. He seemed concerned. I was then sent for a full abdominal ultrasound scan. Again all clear with no further action needed.
I am at a loss here as what could be wrong with me. I am not losing weight and I have not lost my appetite, I am however sinking into depression. Please can anybody offer me some help or advice on what may be going on inside my abdomen?
Thanks for reading

"Hi All, I'm new to this group. Ijoined in desperation and have started reading through some of the discussions which are very interesting. I've had IBS for about 12 years now to varying degrees and have never really got to the bottom of what foods I should cut out. I've got a FODMAP book and will be trying that next. My main symptom is painful stomach (intestine) cramps which keep me awake during the night. What I would like to know is, when experiencing IBS symptoms, other than restricting food groups etc, what receives the symptoms best? Thank you.

"Okay, I'm a 20 year old male and was diagnosed with IBS at the age of 12. I was overweight, anxious and stressed a lot which really messed with my stomach. However, around the age of 15 I lost weight and grew in Confidence thus almost completely ridding me of my IBS symptoms. However, in June of this year, I had a sudden onset of Diarrhea one day. I would go to the toilet and once done I felt like I could go again. This felt like it could have been some kind of infection or bug. It went on for a week or two and really began to worry me. From then on I began obsessing over my bowel movements and worrying about having some serious underlying problem which was causing this diarrhea. The diarrhea did, however, clear up and completely stopped; only it left with IBS like symptoms again. Symptops, some of which I didn't really have last time, that are very IBS-like, such as: Bloating, occasional stomach pain, light brown mucusy looking stools, and i've had nausea once or twice. I should state, however, that during the past month or so I have been severly stressed and my anxiety is sky high. My first thought when I wake up is ""I might have cancer"" and my last thought before I go to sleep is the same. I've lost a few people close to me and I was constantly arguing with my Mother around this period too which really stressed me out the point of feeling depressed.
My stools, however, change so much. Which makes it hard to pin-point what could be wrong with me. They started a yellow kinda colour, and broken up. Then when I was relaxed and not really thinking about it, they would go back to normal colour but would be broken up and rough looking, and fairly easy to pass. When I would get really worried I would then pass diarrhea (which I know is because I'm nervous about my health), and then I'd go back to the mucusy looking stool. 
Over the past few days I've really tried hard to relax, and surprise surprise no stomach pain, bloating or mucus in my stools. I had a small bout of constipation which pased with in a day and then I finally passed what looked like a normal poop. The colour had gone back to normal and the shape was kinda healthy looking. However, after this when I go to the toilet I pass what looks like a normal stool (smooth-ish, fairly long) but it has broken up pieces of stool around it, some of which looks quiet flat looking. It seems odd that I can have a normal stool with something that is abnormal looking around it. If anyone has been through something similar I'd really like to hear from you. The Dr said it could just be my IBS flaring up again, but didn't really do much else other than a blood test. Which came back clear apart from my liver results being ""slightly raised""? 
Apologies for this being all over the place, but my head kind of is at the moment as I've been so anxious about my health. I've just moved into my own place and I'm waiting to start uni, so I've had nothing to do with my time other than sit around by myself thinking I'm dying, which can't be helping my mental health at all. I think i've convinced myself I've had three different types of Cancer in the space of 2 month... haha.  
Thanks,
Shaun

"Hi All,
I live in Scotland and had surgery at the end of July because I was experiencing pain in my lower right abdomen. They doctors ruled out my appendix and found fluid from a ruptured follicle on my ovaries. So, they removed my appendix, just so it couldn't cause trouble in the future.
6 weeks down the line and I am at my wits end. The doctors reckon the naproxen they precribed caused distress in my stomach and bowels. Doctor now reckons I am starting to develop IBS from the meds and distress of the surgery.
My current symptoms are: nausea, constant sore stomach, cramps, pain in lower right (sometimes left) abdomen, diahorrea and loss of appetite. I have meds coming out my ears and starting to get fed up of the docs and this feeling of it being something else.
Any help and advice welcome.

"Hi all,
Just to introduce myself a bit, my name is Mickael, I'm a 27 year old French living in the UK since not long (February).
It has been 9 years I have been having recurrent and very painful bowel spasms now, as you can imagine during these years I have tried ton of different things and done many sacrifices to sort it out. 
I have seen many doctors, gastroenterologists, taken plenty of different pills/medication (against constipation for example which worked and made bowel spasms a bit less painful but didn't prevent them from happening), done several clinical tests such as colonoscopies, fibroscopies, biopsies, scans, changed my life routine to eat healthier and sleep longer/better, etc... no avail... 
And when I say ""it has been 9 years I have been having recurrent and very painful bowel spasms now"" it is not one every 6 months, I must have had something like hundreds of them.... sometimes several times in the same week... each time making me KO, unable to work or
whatever....
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND : even though bowel spasms are indeed extremely painful in my case THE PAIN HAS ACTUALLY NEVER BEEN THE PROBLEM, the main problem is as they are unpredictable, not bearable (as so painful) and therefore need to be relieved right away or... you know what I mean, consequently being able to find toilet has become like a PSYCHOSIS in my daily life, each time I'm outside I'm worried/scared one happens being in the incapicity to do what I have got to do (go to toilet) and the worst is as I know bowel spasms are (often) triggered by stress I'm actually worried/scared to be worried/scared and possibly make one happens ... vicious circle...
Obviously that has had very bad impacts on my life, I stopped going out apart from working, I lost many friends, stayed single 5 years, became kind of antisocial in short...
Until recently I thought I had found out the cause(s) as it seemed finally over (I stopped 2 things in the same time in September 2013 and consequently I have actually no idea which one helped... yes I know not very smart... I was tired to fight so I tried everything) : 
- I stopped smoking after 11 years smoking (I was a very big smoker : ~ 2 packets/30 cigarettes per day)
- I stopped eating gluten (anything based on wheat flour)
As said above I was almost sure I finally figured out the reason (whatever it was : cigarette or gluten) causing these bowel spasms poisoning my life as right after stopping the 2 above things bowel spasms stopped happening... 
You can't imagine how happy I was ! It was like living again as I could finally, after 7 years living everyday in fear, go out without worrying about being able to find toilet or not on my path...
But in last May (2015) (I'm almost sure it is because I ate something out of date but I'm not doctor so no certitude) bowel spasms started again... and the hell with them...
Since they keep happening, not as often as before but the psychosis is back and I live in fear again... 
Having run out of solutions and therefore hopes has made very depressive and I'm now starting having very bad thoughts...
So this is a help call, if you are in the same situation or was or have any idea which might help my condition please let me know.
Mickael.

I'm trying to figure out what it is that's causing me pain.
I've done a food elimination but still can't find what it is.

Anyway an hour later I was walking and suddenly I was bending over in so much pain.
My upper abdomen was cramping like crazy and it really hurt.
What food from the list could cause that?
I'm perplexed by this annoying disorder!
I've cut out coffee, bread, (although I had bread this morning for breakfast) - not sure if that could be it.
I""m so over it - I just want to know what food to NOT eat!

so went to see my gastrologist , who suggested i take the omeprozol and come back in 3 weeks , which i did , the tablets hae helped the indigestion so thats a good sign , i can eat better , but im so worried still about the bloating, he did take a long time explaining all about the Gut and anxiety and has put it all down to my anxiety and IBS , is not over concerned and withholding doing further tests at this stage as feels everything is ok , 
ie: hes not concerned its anything sinister 
due to go back in 6 weeks see how im doing .

This has been going on for over a year and for the past 5 months or so it seemed to have almost disappeared but this week it's back and really getting me down.
I've had two ultrasounds which were clear, blood tests and urine tests. All came back negative/clear.

"I've always suffered with stomach issues. Whether it was severe constipation when I was younger to being diagnosed with acid reflux at 17 (I'm in my early 20's now!) it's always been a part of my life.
My symptoms have become so severe that it's beginning to interefere with my job, my relationships including my marraige, and it's taken over my life. I have become severely depressed and sometimes wonder if giving in to my depression will make the symptoms go away. 
My acid reflux seems to have stopped responding to any treatment. I've taken everything I can think of and am currently on rantidine to deal with the symptoms. However, it does not seem to work any more.
I wake up almost every morning with stomach cramps that often subside once I am up and around (similar to period pains). I will get random bouts of severe nausea with an intense need to go to the bathroom. I should get sick every time but because I have such a severe phobia of getting sick, I do everything in my power to not. I get horrible stabbing pains in the upper right portion of my abdomen as well as the rest of my abdomen. When I am bloated, there is a buldge to the left side of my belly button that is very prominent. I can rarely ever eat all of my food anymore as I feel full after just a few bites.
It's caused me severe anxiety as well. I have lost a total of 20 pounds (weighing at 130 to 110 and recently gaining 5 pounds on top of that). 
My current symptoms are 'the runs' which led to a severe case of nausea that I have taken both cyclizine and an anti-anxiety pill. But nothing seems to help. I always have a lump in my throat with the feeling of acid coming up. 
Sorry for my rambling but I am just sick to death of feeling this way. I've had a colonoscopy, multiple blood tests, and an ultrasound of my gallbladder. All my GP here in the UK has told me is that it is 'IBS' and I just need to deal with it.
I am tired of dealing with it and need help!!

"Hi guys, I've posted here before about how I'm prone to getting water infections and I think it's linked to my IBS, so.. whenever I'm subconsciously anxious about something, it might be because I'm visiting my dad or a change is going on in my life, I dont necessarily feel anxious, but I will gradually become very constipated which is a horrible feeling agd puts me more at risk of getting a water infection.
I've been prescribed something to take when I feel constipated but I'd love to have something which can stop the constipation and also the anxiety. I eat a very balanced diet with fruit and lots of veg, I'm not dairy intolerant or anything and everything is normally fine except when I'm feeling stressed or anxious. I've heard evening primrose oil and help calm the gut down.
Does anyone know of anything to soothe anxiety/ stress and something to calm the spasms in my lower tummy as well?
Thanks

"As most or all of you have this dreadful complaint (myself included) unfortunately there is not real ''Cure''  Taking Fibogel sachets once a day definately makes the stools soft and should eradicate the painful bowl movements, also avoiding ''Nuts and pips'' will definately help too.
 Drinking lots of water will also help being dehydrated is not healthy or doing you any favours with this condition.
  Diverticulitis can in ''Very Extreme'' cases cause death, if the Colon bursts by becoming so badly infected, so using the sachets and drinking water regularly will certainly help prevent that scenario..

"Hi All, I hope I am posting in the right forum.
I have had issues with my stomach now for nearly 7 years and I have all sorts of tests and they all come back clear.
My stomach is always bloated and there is a lot of gurgling coming from the bottom right hand side of my stomach.
I get very tired and feel sick and dizzy.
I dont have a problem with my BM and they are every morning.
I dont get any stomach pain unless I press on it.
I get a lot of pain under my rib cages both right and left and in the centre.
I always seem to get heart palpitations when my stomach flares up.
Nobody has been able to sort anything out I am starting to think I am going mad.
The doctor said it could be anxiety but I dont think so.
I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.
If anyone can shed any light it would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

"I've had IBS for at least ten years, probably longer, to be honest, but I went to the doctor when I was 16 or 17 for constant pain in my lower abdomen and after doing an XRay, which showed an immense ammount of gas and nothing much else and after having me describe my symptoms I was diagnosed with IBS. Additionally, I've had an anxiety disorder for closer to 20 years. My IBS was pretty bad in Highschool...and honestly my anxiety was equally bad, but it was mostly pain a lot of gas and the occasional really bad flair up. Compared to some descriptions I've read, I have had it easy. Foods defintely affected me...but not to a degree where I've really had to cut them out of my diet. 
After college my IBS seemed to improve for a while...and so did my anxiety...both were pretty good for a long time...until this last year.
About a month and a half ago I started a new job and during a very stressful week while working for ten days straight with some overtime hours I had an extremely weird bout of IBS. Almost immediately after having a cheeseburger, said burger ran right through me. It was pure liquid, which is something I've rarely experienced. I thought I might have eaten something wrong, but it was an isolated incident. After that things were normal for the rest of the week. I've had two other similiar experiences since that weren't quite as bad.
Then, this week I started having pain in my stomache, not unlike the pain I usually feel with IBS except that while it has come and gone throughout the week, it hasn't completely gone away. Sometimes it feels like bloading, sometimes like my muscles are stressed or stiff, sometimes there's just a bit of tightness when I stand up or sit down, sometimes it's nearly vanished...but it's always there. It feels like my bowel habits have worsened in the last month. Is it normal for IBS to fluxtuate after so long?
At the same time my anxiety has been at an all time high lately. When I get really anxious I can't turn my brain off so I've managed to convince myself that I have cancer or something despite the fact that apart from maybe weight loss (and I say maybe because I haven't weighed myself in two years and my current weight is in the realms of normal for me) I have no alarm symptoms.
I did go into a walk in clinic yesterday and was told it's probably nothing and given some stomache meds (which I've yet to grab from the pharmacy) but they're kind of limited and only really ruled out appendicitis...which I already kinda assumed was not an option because after the first couple days of this the pain has been rather mild.
Could my IBS just be getting worse because of my increased stress and anxiety? How often does IBS pain usually last?

"Hi all, I haven't posted on here in a while as I was convinced by my symptoms that there was something wrong with my pancreas. My GP was also in agreement that my symptoms sounded like it but all my tests were normal.
I saw my consultant who advised they would do more tests as long as when they came back normal I was to draw a line under it and move on.
My ultrasound was normal but showed debris in my gallbladder. Endoscopic ultrasound showed everything as normal (pancreas, bile ducts and gallbladder).
I am still waiting for my HIDA and SeChat scan which are in September.
I am lost to what is wrong with me now. Could I still have something wrong with my pancreas but it not show on scans? I thought EUS was the best diagnostic for early chronic pancreatitis.
Could it really be IBS? The pain is so disabling! Right after eating on my left side on my ribs and side and goes up into my back and shoulders.
The Amtriptiline seems to be working? Or it could be a coincidence that I started grape seed extract and turmeric at the same time.
I have been tested for IBD, celiac, gastritis. Normal endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Bloods are all normal. (Did have vitamin D deficiency and calcium deficiency).
I bloat after eating, I have lost weight and struggled to put it back on which I have slowly managed to do. My stools are loose, diarrohea, yellow, orange and light brown in colour. I suffer with bone aches and pains, intigestion, acid reflux, heart palpitations, fast heart rate, sore throat, mouth ulcers and throat ulcers, any food with any fat in it causes me huge problems. I have undigested food in my stool.
Any help with any of this would be great!
Thanks in advance!

"Hi Everyone,
I'll keep this as short as I can, I'm booked in for my first appointment with the Gastroenterologist next week after over 6 months of struggling with whatever it is i'm dealing with.
I'm a 28 year old male.
My GP has diagnosed me with IBS / Acid Reflux and has given me Peppermint Oil tablets and Lansoprazole.
My symptoms are the following -
- Abdominal swelling / bloating (sometimes after meals, sometimes when I havent eaten anything)
- Acid Reflux / tightness in sternum / slight feeling in neck near adams apple
- Constipation after certain foods
- Weight loss (2 stone in total, but I have been eliminating dairy/gluten/fatty foods etc from my diet so this may be down to my overall change in diet)
- A pressure beneath my shoulderblades sometimes after I eat (trapped wind maybe?)
- Mucus in stool (as im constipated a fair bit, sometimes I feel like i really need to go, but all that happens is I pass a little bit of Mucus - sometimes with blood mixed in)
- Itchy bottom quite a lot!
- Blood in stool (blood appears in my stool around 40% of the time I can actually go, sometimes its faintly mixed in with mucus, sometimes its on the outside of the stool. My doctor has put this down to hemmerhoids from constipation and forcing BM's but the colour of the blood sometimes concerns me, it's very rarely bright red anymore and its more of a middle-red ... once or twice it has been darker red which worries me a bit)
I have never had the best diet and have always had stomach distension but its only since last December when i got really clogged up that most of these other symptoms appeared ... or I noticed them at least.
I've tried everything, Probiotics, different medicines, change of diet, stopping drinking alcohol for periods of time, change of eating habits and times ... I've seen some improvement with my constipation depending on what I'm eating but the other symptoms don't seem to ever go away no matter what I do.
Of course, whilst i've been waiting to be referred to the GE It's been a total guessing game and just trial and error to fix myself up, but with the ongoing symptoms I've now got an eye on other possible causes. The dreaded C's (Colitis, Chrohns, Cancer   ), Possible parasites? 
I'm just looking for anyone that has had similar experience that can give me some hope that this could all still just be IBS ... I know the above conditions are still possible but at the minute my brain is pretty convinced that I have something other than IBS - mainly because of the bloody stool and the colour of the blood being darker than I assume you'd expect to find with internal hemmerhoids. The back ache makes me think of Pancreatic issues too ...
I suppose my question is, has anyone had mucus / darker red blood in the stool and been confirmed that it is down to IBS? - everywhere I look online says if its darker then it's something more sinister. Its not all the time and its only small amounts, usually at the start of a BM. 
Thank you so much to any of you that have taken the time to read this and anyone that replies, these forums are gold for people that have issues.

"I am a 28 year old woman and for many years I have had stomach cramps after eating, bloating, and tiredness, however in the last few months my symptoms have changed. I now experience pain in my upper stomach and for a while i was being sick after eating. I was tested for Helicobacter but the results were negative, and i have had a Sigmoidoscopy plus an ultrasond of my pelvis again nothing sinister was to be found. I now have a loss of appetite and getting anxious over what i should eat as no matter what I eat I have this discomfort. Even having a drink if water first thing in the morning aggravates my stomach and I feel like I've eaten a 3 course meal. I work in an office so sit at a desk all day, I'm finding this hard as I cannot get comfortable due to the upper stomach constantly cramping. I visited my doctor today and he has taken yet more bloods and is now referring me for a scope down my throat. My mother and her brother both have IBS, my brother who is 31 has Chrons and had a large part of his upper bowel removed two years ago. My grandmother on my fathers side died of bowel cancer so due to my family members having these kind of problems I am very concerned as to what is going on. I have tried the usual Mebeverine, Buscopan, Lansporazole etc all to no avail. Does anyone have any ideas or know of anyone having the kind of symptoms that I am experiencing? Any feedback would be hugely appreciated.

"I'm going to try and keep this short and sweet,
Basically Ive problems with Both my stomach and my bowels, 1 I can't pass stools although they are soft (I have to help my self constantly) and constantly feel the need to pass stools, do get the odd abdominal cramps on the left bottom sode of my abdomen. What I am worrying about now is, in December I had a random onset of complete loss of appetite and feeling naucious after eating, doctor said this was due to constipation and prescribed me laxido, these seemed to work 11 weeks later symptoms returned, yet laxatives made the problems considerably worse and since then I have not been able to pass stools just with normal pushing since. Coming away from that my loss of appetite and stomach burning has returned except it's getting worse as time goes on, for the past few weeks every time I eat or drink I am burping considerable amounts, always getting nauseous and sometimes stomach pains, if I eat a substantial meal and sometimes having a big drink (I only drink water recently) then within 2 minutes Getting the symptoms I get every time I eat/ drink but 5/10 minutes I'm feeling sick and a burp will usually bring back food,(this has only happened a handful of times over this course of having symptoms) if I'm near a toilet I run for it and I will vomit but only liquids and sometimes Abit of food, for the past few days it also constantly feel like a weigh is I my stomach.
I am awaiting a letter to see a specialist, just thinking if this does sound like ibs if anyone has has ibs cause them to be vomiting continuously after food/drink?
My parents are wanting me to look at going to A&E tomorrow if the vomiting happens again as this will be the 4th day in a row! But I don't want to do this if others have had ibs cause this
So it's not so short but I greatly apriciate any responses

"Hey!
So I've been dealing with what I presume is IBS since I developed really bad social anxiety and depression with that.. Apparently the ibs is triggered by stress, which I notice increases how bad the ibs can get. I know a lot of people develop ibs with anxiety. (I also seem to get this nausea which my doctor has said is caused by my anxiety).
So every now and again, I feel as if I eat something, it can be totally random, something that didn't previously upset my digestive tract before, and then a few hours later, usually at ridiculous times so I'm unable to sleep like now (4:30am) I start to get a dull stomach ache, then a sudden urge to use the bathroom, and then for up to an hour I'm back and fourth to the loo, feeling nauseous and hot and sometimes dizzy. My mum has ibs and I've noticed if she eats a fair amount of rich foods it triggers hers, so could I perhaps have a similar thing to her?
Sometimes this can last on and off for a few days, and I was wondering if there are any tablets or remedies to help with it, maybe prevent it, or even just to make it less of an awful experience? It's getting to be a pain when I have to wake up at 9am but can't sleep due to my bowels! I'd really appreciate some feedback as I'm fed up of my mum saying it's just me being a hypochondriac -_-

"Where do I start? I'm not sure how relevant the back story is to my current issues but it might help get some answers.. I'm 23 years old and male.
My stomach has always been sensitive, but I could handle spice, alcohol and pretty much any foods without worry. I recently went travelling for 5 and a half months, months 1-2 spent in Malaysia and Thailand. Whilst in Thailand I had stomach issues (wretching, could hardly stand up, unusual bowel movements (can only describe as fluffy with mucus). I saw three doctors, took anti acid medication along with 'Norofloxacin' for a suspected upper bowel infection and almost immediately went back after finding a worm, roughly two inches long in the toilet bowl. I was also then given a course of 'Mebendazole', though the doctor seemed reluctant to accept that the stomach issues were due to the parasite, as they were so common. 
After a while I started to feel a bit better, but not normal by any means, and was told to take charcoal tablets to rid my gut of potentially bad toxins. My symptoms then started to appear again, in the form of bloating, loose stool, feeling drained and nausous. It wasn't long after this I developed eustachian tube dysfunction and so wasn't whether it was the ear or the stomach to blame for dizziness and off-balance. Going back to a medical clinic in Malaysia, I was prescribed the following:
'Hyoscine Butylbromide'
'Rebamipide'
'Itopride Hydrochloride'
'Esomeprazole'
The doctor insisted that I had developed acid reflux and damaged the lining of my bowel post-infection, and these medicines started to really help me - I felt good for a while, the acidity, bloating and stood seemed to return almost to its normal state. I then went to Australia, where my symptoms seemed to be almost gone, other than waking up most mornings with a dull ache in my abdomen, which went away throughout the day, and an increase in gas from prior to leaving for the trip in the UK. Before leaving Australia I noticed a similar looking worm, dead this time - accompanied by  cramping and the ache in the morning. I decided to get some more Mebendazole from a pharmacy and took it, which didn't actually relieve me of many symptoms. 
Anyway I wouldn't say I have been fully right since Thailand, and actually got worse recently to the point where I decided to return to the doctor, where I had blood tests and two stool samples sent away to check for thyroid issues, coeliac, parasites etc.. everything came back normal, and my symptoms are worsening. I wake up with lots of gas, noisy stomach, cramping throughout the day, feeling like I need to empty my bowels but usually not much comes out (I wouldn't say I am constipated though) and passed blood on a single occassion about a week ago (none since). Worst of all, I get waves of feeling absolutely drained, to the point where I am having to leave my friends and family and just go and lie down and I now consider 'normal' just having the cramping, gas, and sicky feeling with lots of squeeky noises coming from my bowel. It's really starting to affect my life and I can almost hear the doctors muttering 'anxiety' and 'probably IBS'. Can IBS really make you feel this ill? I refuse to believe it! I have heard that parasites can cause very similar symptoms, and don't always show from the stool testing. I have been told that a colonoscopy is a good idea, so will certainly consider that. I have been taking Yakult, eating yoghurt, trying to restore my gut flora and am taking peppermint capsules and back on the espramazole to reduce the sicky feeling. I am going to bring up the following possibilites when I see the doctor tomorrow:
- Candida Overgrowth (my girlfriend has issues with yeast infections and i have never seemed to suffer, at least I don't think so)
- Giardiasis/Blastocystis Hominis
- Crohns Disease/Ulcerative Colitis
- SIBO
- Lactose/Glucose Intolerance (Even though bloods returned normal)
- Cancer (very unlikely but want to rule this out)
could it all be post infectious IBS as my doctor suggested? What else would you recommend investigating? Any suggestions welcome as I can't go on living like this!

Lately it seems that when ever I touch any food with a hint or spice within 2-5 minutes of finishing said food I would get intense stomach paints and then follows the run to the toilet.
I feel this may be cause by myself as I used to put chilli sauce and spices on everything but I don't do it as much now as because what I have just said.
But now if I have any spice at all it triggers it this could be from a mild curry to a spicy crisp (chip) such as Doritos heat wave.

"Hi there! 
I've been reading the posts on this particular forum and have found some interesting answers. I'm still unsure as to what I should do.
All of last year I suffered with a haemorraghed cyst in my left ovary. As soon as that had disappeared, last august I started to get a hard feeling at the top of my stomach where I think my duodenum is situated. I remember having a shower and feeling really sick after eating a big meal. I started to press around my stomach and discovered that I had this hard feeling in this specific area and that if I pressed into it, I would make me gag. I didn't have any problems whatsoever before last August. All of a sudden I'm getting all of these symptoms. I've been informed that IBS can start at any point in someone's life, out of the blue. So of course, I was told these symptoms were IBS and down to stress. I suffer from constant bloating, constant nausea, constant brain fog and not being able to concentrate on anything properly, extreme fatigue and general uncomfortableness. It's really upsetting to have to undo my button my trousers everytime I eat something - small or big. I'm quite a petite woman also, so I find that it really shows when I'm bloated. I personally think that my body is struggling to digest food properly - I'm not sure what this hard feeling is? I've had millions of blood tests and I've had the HPlori breathliser test - everything has come back fine. I haven't had a scan on my stomach though. I put myself on a gluten free diet for 6 weeks and felt like I had a lot more energy, bloating went down with a lot of meals. However I was told that if I then ate gluten after that I would see a massive difference. I am bloating a lot more now that I am not gluten free but I don't see a massive difference at all. I want to be referred to see a dietician but they seem to have a problem with referring me to one! 
Don't know what to do.
Any help would be much appreciated!

Tammy.

aching limbs , fingers and toes 
burning sensation on back from time to time 
same as above all BM 
and then last weekend i decided to try some gluten free bread to se if can help my IBS so i had 4 slices in totalin the day  and got very bad indigestion , then following morning i had such bad right side pain i was in agony and felt tender , this passed in about and hour , my morning BM was darker than normal not back but alot lot  darker .....set me into a panic ....the following day i had a similar BM although not all dark other was ok ...well as ok it is for me ...my tummy was ok but still a bit tender ...
from wednesday onwards things have settled down , except my anxiety is now so high (not helping ) i then googled  BC and frightened myself as it mentioned maroon black  colour stools , and now thinking about it maybe mine was maroon ....
today i went and was ok well as it can be , no dark or maroon no blood or bright blood so ...hoping it was just a blip ....
i did go and see my gastro man on thursday night and he said he wasnt alarmed from what i was saying , but will do poo inflamitory test to be sure ...i didnt mention the maroon colour as i didnt know about that always thought was black that was the scary one to check for , indeed he kept asking me was it black ..

"Hello there
I'm 26 years old, I've suffered with constipation since birth.
Then I had a great normal 2 years amazing!
Last year July I started getting rumbling and loud noises in my tummy, followed with watery stools covered in mucus.
Like normal I thought I've eaters something bad, or I had a small infection so of to the GP I went. She examined me and so wow lots of bubbling & loud noises she suspected it was a gastric infection. She requested for me to do bloods and a stool test
It came back clear, she sent me home. It carried on for a further month I was gutted!
Then over November period I started getting serve indigestion, trapped gas in my rectum and the smell was awful & embarrassing, nausea.
The doctors then told me IBs would be to blame, I was given Melberine and laxido to help me go. It worked, but the indigestion got worse to the point I felt I couldn't breathe. Eventually the Laxido stopped, I went back to the GP as I felt I lost weight. She said I doubt it but I will weigh you, she said 'ow my god you have lost 6lb in 8 weeks' then found my colon & small intestines swollen.
She gave me some supposidries and said if nothing improves you must come back in 2 weeks.
Well I found out I was 4 weeks pregnant, due to hormones it was making things more worse. That I would not be allowed to have a colonoscopy, I was put on another set of supposidries.
Once I had administrated them after being in pain all night, the baby heart stopped at 10 weeks. We went to the hospital for scan that day confirmed.
I wasn't shocked I knew the meds and the suffering would do it.
Finally I got a referral to see a gastric specialist altho ID have to wait another 4 weeks for an appointment. In the last 5 weeks I am now having blood and chunks of pink tissue in my stool it looks like stomach lining in an odd way & constipation is back.
I am now awaiting in June to have a gastroscopy and biopsy and colonoscopy, end of the month a scan of my liver. The specialist mentioned to test for Cealic but she generally thought it is IBS.
My results will be given in August!
I'm so scared I have colon cancer and that I have been left with it to progress by the time they have caught it, it would be 13 months in August.
I was just wondering is anyone on here having the same thing, constipation, blood and pink to then white flesh mixed in there stool??
Thank you so much for reading this, I have lost 9lbs and now at 7stone2 I hate it!!

"Hi, I've been posting on the IBD board for months as that's what I was told I had. Now the consultant seems unsure. Basically, after months of tests I have:-
Inflammation in my stool sample
lactose intolerant
glucose and fructose intolerant
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
joint pain
random bouts of vomiting
chronic pain in the right lower quadrant
normal BM's x 5 per day or diarrhea up to 15x per day
weight now stable at 8st, lowest weight 6.12
I've has a colonoscopy which was clear, a barium meal, clear and white cell scan also clear.
I have a VERY restricted diet. No fruit, limited vegetables and usually eat gluten free pasta/rice or plain sandwiches. I'm missing out whole food groups to control my symptoms. For the last 6 days I've had really bad nausea when eating and severe pain in my right side. The pain isn't relieved by a BM, if anything it increases the pain.
Anyone have IBS like this?
Thanks

"After several visits to the doctors and numerous tests that revealed nothing wrong with my stomach/intestines I was told I most likely had IBS. I am 47 years old, and had always had a sensitive stomach, but it had progressively gotten worse over the course of several months with bouts of diarrhea, cramps, bloating and a rolling stomach. I read some reviews of Symprove and thought that I would give it a try, the price being justified if it worked. After around 2 or 3 weeks I notice less bloating though my stomach was still 'iffy'. Gradually over the weeks it settled more and more until after about 7 to 8 weeks I was experiencing almost no bloating or diarrhea and less cramps. I am now almost at the 12 week stage and I'm very impressed with the change. Touch wood almost all of the symptoms have gone and my stomach feels normal. 
I strongly recommend that if you IBS then give Symprove a go, stick with it for the 12 weeks and hopefully it will make as much difference to you as it did to me. I'm sure it doesn't work for everyone but my experience is has been extremely positive. After this last week I'm going to drop to a half does a day and see how that goes.
I know for lots of people the price is quite high, but well worth the money if it works as well as it has for me.
Thanks Symprove'

"Hi, I'm just wondering has anyone suffered with the same symptoms as me and ever found a cure. About 18 months ago out of the blue my stomach started to bloat, more stomach distension. I was getting severe cramps and tugging feeling inside. Since then I have gotten a wide range of other symptoms like thrush, tiredness, brain fogginess p, nausea to name a few. These come and go but my severe bloating and cramps have been with me every single night since then. I thought it might've started from overuse of antibiotics. But this is me guessing. I have been to numerous doctors, nutritionists, allergy doctors but to no avail. I have tried ever diet under the sun and they relief some symtoms but not bloating and overall unwell feeling. I've had all the medical tests too. I have been off sugar and grains since January and also fodmaps. I have always been so strict but it's getting harder when nothing working. I tried some medication for bacteria and have been on nystatin a few months also for yeast. Not one person has done a stool test etc to check for parasites or yeast. They all just guess and give up when no improvement. It is getting me so down I'm not sure what to do next. Last thing I can think of is parasites. I have found the Irish medical system useless and I am constantly left on my own to figure it out. I was thinking of going to England maybe but it all costs. Anyone else suffer like this. In 18 months I think I have about 5 nights where symtoms not as bad. I was even put on 2 wk severe detox but no no avail. Losing hope and getting me down. Any advice appreciated. Thanks

"I got diagnosed with ibs earlier this year, at the beginning it was dreadful. Their was no clear signs for me because one day the food that was giving me pains wouldn't the day after so it was all confusing. I tried healthy eating but that just made me worse so now I eat like I normally would but just lesser portions and I feel alright most of the time. Still haven't got used to my bowel movements yet, sometimes Im really uncomfortable but this happens about twice a week now which I can handle if I take my buscopan regularly. Since I got diagnosed, my muscles and joints have been really weird and I read some information about ibs and the different symptoms and it did say about weakness of joints and muscles. I tore the ligaments in my big toe in both feet 3 times without even doing anything to them. Then I lost my balance in the shower because of my ankle pain and I sprained my wrist and that just feels weak all the time. Then Saturday last week, I was out with mates and my leg just gave way from under me, I was only standing there and it felt like it was cramp in my knee. Got rushed to the hospital and they sent me to the fracture clinic on Thursday, thank god it was just torn ligaments in my knee but the pain was so bad. I was just wondering has anyone else had an increase in muscle/joint/bone weakness since being diagnosed with ibs? I really need to find someone else to relate to with this because Im only 20 years of age and I don't think my bones and stuff should be this weak.

"Hi
Today I decided to eat an English muffin I toasted it very well with some black coffee. Waiting to see what happens to me. I have been feeling like a Rabbit and hence losing weight because I am afraid to eat. Although I eat proteins vegetables and some rice I still feel sometimes like I need some toast in the morning. I used to eat greek yogurt in the morning as it is in the fodmap but I was told to stay away from dairy altogether. Yogurt used to give me some energy. It is not like I feel hungry, I feel weak and tired. Maybe it's depression.
Any thoughts?

"Ok this might sound weird but I've been getting diarrhoea every weekend for at least 6 months now. It starts on a Saturday morning when I'm either woken up by the pain of needing to go to the toilet or it happens within 10-20 mins of me waking up. I get really hot and i've literally get to go there and then or I'll be in a mess. I have it throughout the weekend and then come Monday morning it's stopped but that low grumbling feeling like I still need to go the loo is there but no diarrhoea. It's normally Tuesday when i have a semi normal bowel movement. It gets better as the week goes on but religiously every Saturday it starts again. I don't work at the weekend's but do at least 11 hours a day Monday to Friday and im always very busy. Is this ibs or am I crazy? I want to go to the docs but the issues start at the weekend and by the time Monday comes I think oh its better now so don't go hoping it won't come back but im kidding myself. I've tried excluding bread from my diet but that's had no effect tbh. Has anyone else had anything like this? Thanks

"Hi, I just recently found out I had IBS, I've started probiotics and I started a completely different diet plan. For three weeks I was in pain and had diarrhea but before this I was always constipated, so this diagnosis makes sense. But the weeks before going to the doctor I was actually dry heaving after every meal, sometimes I would even throw up the meal I just ate. Now starting ptobiotics and changing my eating habits I am still throwing up my food. Should I wait a few weeks and see if anything changes? I've read that vomiting isn't a normal symptom of ibs. Does anyone else have this issue? I dont know if I'm puking because the pain is making me physically ill or if it's because my body can't digest the food I'm eating properly. Does anyone have any tricks on how to stop the pain or make it better?

"So I have been diagnosed with ibs. I alternate between constipation and diarrhea. Along with constipation and diarrhea, I have joint pain, major bloating, inability to lose weight, excess fat storage in abdominal area, fatigue and acid reflux. I got so desperate with wanting to lose weight that i started eating only 500 calories a day, and my diet only consisted of watermelon, as it seemed like watermelon caused the least amount of symptoms. Even with this, I weighed 124 pounds. I'm 5'2. now, i get extremely bloated after i eat anything. I've realized that certain spicy foods and fruits make the symptoms way worse so I cut it out. But now I'm stuck... The symptoms will not go away. What am I doing wrong here? What other foods should i avoid?

"hey all,
need some advice, recently, mainly today, my stool habits are changing a lot, constipation, to normal to a little diaharea, not severe but a little, now, I have Health Anxiety and recently was diagnosed with GERD, however the colour of the stool was a little brown/grey/yellow ish colour, like a mixture....is it common with IBS to get such colours of stools? Terrified of Pancreatic issues like cancer, I had IBS diagnosed so I know I have that, so I am sure it is simply IBS and nothing more, I am only 29 years old and assuming pancreatic cancer would be very very unlikely...only 6 months ago had blood tests and LFT which showed my liver etc was fine and had endoscopy which showed nothing wrong with me only 5 months ago....but 5 weeks ago, GERD started up and since my health anxiety got the best of me....
My question is with your IBS/GERD, do you commonly change bowel shapes/colours etc???

Personally i think doctors are to quick to say oh you have IBS i find it very annoying.
I have endrometriosis and have it for nearly 10 years i had my gall bladder removed april 2014 since then i havent been right and have regular flare ups of pain in the top on my stomach and the right side i also suffer with nausea vomiting trouble sleeping unexplained weight gain even though i only eat 1 small meal a day. I recently had 2 episodes where i began sweating really bad then went very dizzy and my legs give way. When i open my bowels they are not loose and i open my bowels regularly. On occassion i do have blood in my stools sorry for being graphic. Please can anyone tell me if the following symptoms i have listed above describe IBS ? Or is it the case my doctor is fobbing me off saying it is IBS instead of carrying out proper investigations. Thank you in advance

"Hi everyone. I am 35 years old female and have a daughter just under 2. I have for most of adult life suffered from hard stool and I have a , fissure as a result that comes and goes from time to time. I have also experienced occasional pain in my lower to mid right abdomen that can last a whole day and be gone the next. Now for the past two weeks I have been having a change in bowel movements to looser stools and mild cramps. There are also pains on my right that are localized and come and go. Not sharp but feel like something is in there. And as I said they come and go. I also have lots of gas and extreme intestinal growling. Another thing I experience is bruised like feeling in ascending and transverse colon. Especially after a bowel movement. I usually will have a day or two without cramps and going to the toilet only once to going 3 to 6 times in a row. Never had this problem before. Very afraid this is something really bad. Been to Dr and we have done a complete blood count and all is fine. I suffer usually from severe health anxiety and have been back and forth at Dr and she is sending me for a urgent colonoscopy within two weeks and she thinks it could be ibs or some form of ibd. No blood in stools. So while I am waiting for an appointment my anxiety has been going through the roof. Please if anyone has any thoughts or any input it would be greatly appreciated.

"Hi all, just wondered if anyone had had this same issue.
I pretty much had all by IBS triggers down until last summer when i suddelnly started getting diarrhoea, which i'd never had before (always IBS-C). since then my stomach has been doing its own thing, i'll be fine for ages then randomly be ill when i havent had anything different. i've had two episodes of diarrhoea for a month solid where i've had to live of toast and crackers and even then that can go through me.
anyway, i've tried to work out my 'new' triggers but there doesnt seem to be much of a correlation.
the only issues i've found is anything greasy (duh) and for some strange reason, porridge. now i have been eating porridge for about the last 10 years with no effects, but for the last few months i found i was always having an upset stomach on saturday afternoons, no matter what i had for lunch. the only common denominator was that i have porridge in the morining as i go running on saturdays. so i tried different breakfast and running and was fine, tried poridge on another day and was ill.
I have no idea why this is as i use the same brand of oats and prepare them in the same way. now i am even more limited in what i can eat.
it also seems like mayonaise might be an issue for me too, and again i've eaten it for years.
anyone else suddenly become intollerant to stuff for no reason?

Last Christmas, my Gastro doctor said I'll more than likely be diagnosed as IBS-D. Has anyone else been diagnosed this? It is absolutely awful. Can anyone give some insight how to just make things a bit better?
I can no longer work, go out and have to be close to a toilet at all times. Pretty much house bound really! I've been in counselling which ended as could no longer make it to the appointments due to the ibs. My last resort is to get a colostomy bag fitted, anyone had one fitted due to IBS-D?
I'm booked in tomorrow for a full colonoscopy (saying goodbye to the last of my didnity! Haha) after the looking into my bowel didn't show anything but continuously being in severe pain and constant toilet breaks they have decided to look at everything. This time being sedated. I envy those of you who can do it without any pain relief!!
My first time was nothing bad at all. The second time, well let's just say I may have passed out.... Haha.
Done the first picolax solution and still haven't been after an hour and a half.. Anyone know how long this is supposed to take to start working?

I was just wondering if anybody has used this particular treatment before and whether or not it has worked for you? I've tried many other treatments already including Colpermin and Buscopan for shorter term relief. I really need to try something new and I think this could be it. Just to let you know I am a female who has suffered with IBS for roughly 30 years on and off.
Any help on this topic would be much appreciated!

"I've been clear of ibs symptoms for 2 months up until last week. I had a take away and got really bad stomach pains that evening with quite a lot of bloating. The next day I felt ok but thought I would play it safe and keep a close eye on my diet and stick with gluten free (as this seems to help) over the following days.
Anyway last Thursday I started feeling crap and have remained feeling bad since. I've been 100% gluten free now for 8 days, have limited my sugar intake and usually this has always settled my system... But it hasn't.
Wondering what these symptoms point towards... Foamy saliva, weird gnawing pain in stomach, slight burning in throat, stomach noises, anxiety, dizzyness, tiredness, aching legs??? If I eat anything within 10 minutes I get strange pains in my stomach. I don't seem to have diahrrea, I've bed really tired though. I have also got this weird dull ache down my legs. This is really different to any of my typical ibs. Usually I just have diahrrea. Like I said I've been free of symptoms for the past 2 months and now something strange is going on?

"I went in for a operation on my nose 10 weeks ago after I broke my nose. I was then unable to pass urine so had to have a catheter fitted. I then had s trail without 3 weeks later still unable to pass urine. 10 weeks on and I'm still waiting to get my catheter sorted! I had an ultrasound yesterday and just awaiting the results.
I have suffered with IBS for a few years now but since my operation my bowels have been unproductive. I had to have 2 enamas this week after I hadn't had movement for over a week. I had been on Senna tablets and laxido and still nothing helped!
I went back to my doctors today and she said it may all be linked to what caused my urine retention? Or that my bladder could be putting pressure on my bowel? I was just wondering if anyone else has any experience of this?
I'm really getting fed up of tests and having to make trips to the doctors all the time!

"Hello, Well this is my first post so if it is all a jumble then apologies. I started placement on the 18th (Monday) and was there on Monday and Tuesday but I have been off yesterday and today. I am having issues with my IBS, I seem to be having a flair up. I am feeling very bloated and very uncomfortable while being constipated too. In the first 2 days of placement i had to rush out while in class as I needed the loo urgently. I am worried as I have heard if I am off for 4 or more days then I will fail placement. Does anyone have any advice, please?

"Hi, I am looking for adive if someone exeprience the same as I do.
I have a very bad IBS for 5 years. I am intolerant to gluten too. I am very careful with my food, I am gluten free, and I try Fodmap diet.
But, every morning, I have very bad diarreah, just like if I don't assimilate the food I eat. And I often have the sensation I need to go to the bathroom all along during the day. If I take something against diarreah I have the opposite : constipation. I also have a lot of water in my colon, it s so noisy, like if I always have 1 liter there. What can I do? I really don'y know anymore, I tried so any things...Thanks a lot

"Hi All,
I have been in and out of the doctors and ER for the past two months and i am looking for some real answers and hope someone can help. My whole saga is a bit long so please bare with me.
I started a diet and working on in the beginning of this Feb. I was eating healthy and drinking lots of water. I usually pee about 10+ times a day, which is noraml to me. Mid February I was loosing weight and peeing a lot more then usual, which i assumed was because i was drinking more water. I was having some lower back pain and thought it was from working out or sitting at my work desk all day... Now it is mid march and i have extereme nausea, bloated stomach, and feel like i am going to pee myself. I went to the doctor and she thought i had a UTI, so she took a urine culture and gave me medicine. Two days later, the medicine was not working, and the dr called and said my pee was negative for bacteria. I went to the doctor again a few days later, another urine culture and pregnancy test, both negative. The dr thought maybe i had a stomach bug or an irrated bladder so she gave me anti-nausea pills and i left. That night i felt so horrible i went to the ER,  they tested my urine and NOW my urine was FILLED with bacteria!! They gave me UTI medicne and 3 days later i was STILL feeling sick. I made an appoitnemt with a urologist where they did a CT scan for a kidney stone, and it was negative. My DR put me on augmentim, but it wasnt helping,soshe put me on 10 days of amoxicillan and FINALLY my back pain, frequent urination was gone. BUT my stomach was still in pain. Not only did I have pain when i ate, but i was getting full extremely quickly, my stomach would bloat 4-5 inches everytime i ate, and the nauseas was so horrible, I lost about 10 lbs in 3 weeks.  i ended upback in the ER where they performed an ultra sound, they found sludge in my galbladder and something on my liver which they said was benign.  I went to the GI doctor and he thought my galbladder was to blame so i did a test on my galbladder and it was normal.. I then started to get horrible acid reflux so i had an endoscopy. After the endoscopy i started to spit up and later that night i ended up back in the ER because i got an pneumonia from spitting up. The results from the endoscopy was i have gastritis ( with an unknown cause) and acid in my esphogus. I was prescribed acid reflux medicne and  Bentyl. The GI dr thinks its IBS ( which i dont think so). I went to a natropathic dr and she thinks its  my liver function. My acid reflux and nausea are better but my stomach gets more bloated now then ever, and i think my bladder infection is coming back. Has this happened to anyone? Can anyone help me please?

"I had extreme pain and diahorea. Turned out afdter a number of emergency admission etc...I had been incoorectly treated for diverticulitis (I didn't have it) and the antibiotics had created Clostridium difficile infection, which was antibiotic resistant. After a long nightmare of more antivbiotics, getting sicker, huge pain occasionally...Vancomycin for ten days and Sacaromycae Boulardii probiotic for one month sorted it out. 
Then gastritis which had eroded my oesophagus was diagnosed. I raised the head of my bed by putting bricks under the legs.
Stopped coffee, drank water in samll glasses and not a lot at a time, no food or drinks 3 hours before bed.
Left with IBS.Gastroenterologist #2 recommended mint oil capsules and an herbal digestive liquid to take before meals. Searched the internet and found a list of the FODMAP diet foods...the IBS is barely bothering me now...night and day in just a fortnight!
Still taking the probiotic that protects against bad gut bugs (saccaromycae boulardii) and a broaad spectrum probiotic in addition. Eating only sourdough bread and lactose free milk. 
I did it by reading a lot and searching for information on the internet and not giving up. Most of my solutions were ac taully very simple. Antibiotics actually created the ahrm I experienced and I will never take a broad spectrum again without knowing specifically what iti s treating.
I was allergic to the proton pumps, two of them, so that is why I had to keep searching and did things like raised my bedhead.
For piost nasal drip, I removed the carpet from my house (discovered I had an extreme dust mite allergy) and started moppingh the wooden floor with hot water, vbinegar and eucalyptus oil. Washed all bedding in hot water with a cap of eucalyptus oil in the water and dried in the sun. Made sure there was no dust mite in any of the stored clothing etc. Used saline nasal spray and a newer steroid spray that treats only the tissue that needs it, very clever designed med. Took antihistamines til it was under control and if it comes back.
The FODMAP list was very helpful...doctors didn't mention it to me...found it searching on the internet.
VERY counterintuitive but it worked for me. I am now down to about 3% of the pain levels I had six months ago. Just had to systematically keep on working through the symptoms and get the correct diagnosis and not give up or panic.

"Mebeverine was prescribed for me for colon spasms and diarrhoea which was actually caused by ovarian cancer. The symptoms can be very similar to those experienced by IBS patients and I was misdiagnosed for three years as having this complaint. When I was finally correctly diagnosed during investigations for possible bowel cancer I was found to have an advanced and unsurprisingly inoperable ovarian cancer with metasteses involving both small and large intestines. Cancer growths covered almost all abdominal and pelvic organs and peritoneum and replaced connective tissue in the omentum. I have survived for five years with occasional chemotherapy but would advise any ladies who have not had IBS properly diagnosed to ask for an ultrasound scan and a CA125 blood test. Make sure that malignant disease is excluded as a possibility. Other ovarian cancer symptoms can be waist size increase, bladder frequency and fatigue. ALWAYS make sure that your GP has considered this as a possibility. This disease is deadly. Most do not survive it.

"Hi everyone, I would like to share some of my frustrations with my health and am hoping someone has any idea of what is wrong with me. I experience abdominal discomfort/distension/tenderness/bloating on a daily basis, and it has been this way for the past 10 months. When I wake up I feel pretty good, and it slowly gets worse throughout the day. Night time I feel the worst, and when I lie down it's uncomfortable but I've gotten somewhat used to it so falling asleep isn't a big issue. My bowel habits are quite regular and I almost never get constipation or diarrhea, maybe once in a while, but nothing out of the ordinary. I've been to my GP many times and tried different anti-spasmatic drugs which have hardly helped. It helped numb my stomach but that made it so that I couldn't tell AT ALL if I was hungry or not. So that was problematic because then I would end up feeling faint at times because of lack of food. I got tested for several things like celiac disease and H pylori bacteria and what not, and everything has come back normal. I finally got a referral to see a gasteroenterologist yesterday, however, I live in Canada and the wait times can be quite long for specialists, so I have to wait approximately 2-3 more months before I can see a specialist. This is frustrating as you can imagine. Anyways, I'm just wondering if it's possible to have IBS without any issues with bowel movements? My GP believes I have IBS even though the only symptoms I have are: fatigue, abdominal pain, and bloating. Any comments are appreciated. Thanks!

"I am 55 and have had reflux for about ten years taking increasingingly larger doses of Omeprazole, now on 40mg at night. During this time I have also had intermittent attacks of stomach cramps sometimes maybe only once or twice a year again increasing as I have got older. Until this last year the attacks have been easy to handle with painkillers. The pain has however increased and the severity and length of attacks of pain has also increased. The pain can be just below the breast bone, around the whole abdomen, or sharp stitch like pains in one or two places around my tummy. I started an attack six weeks ago which has produced all three areas of pain and often all at the same time. I have had little or no releif since. I do not however have either diahrroea or constipation. I am in fact very regular and normal. I do belch a lot and I get a fair bit of trapped wind The gp says it is IBS. It seems to be that there is no one food that causes it but I avoid salad especially tomatoes (which I love!) raw veg, peppers and onions and spicy food. And it seems anything too tomatoey! I wake up in the morning and feel fine but as the day draws on and I eat the evening is pain all the way until I go to bed with a nightly dose of Paracetamol. I have had a whole load of blood tests which have showed up nothing! Help!! Is this IBS? How do I manage it? Can this last as long as this in any one bout?
Really would like some advice from anyone out there in the same boat!!

"Hey everyone,
I've heard that IBS is caused by trigger foods and that the IBS symptoms can be reduced by finding out what triggers the symptoms and avoiding it. I always have to rush to the bathroom several times a day without fail. I've tried the low-FODMAPS diet for 2 months a few months ago, but I didn't notice any difference. I ate the foods that were allowed on the FODMAP and no matter what I ate or drank, I still had the same symptoms. They weren't reduced and I didn't feel any different. So I'm not sure which food triggers my symptoms or if it happens with anything I eat/drink. Could it be possible that IBS can also be tiggered by any type of food or drink and not necessarly a specific type? How can anyone live a normal life being afraid of eating, drinking, or doing anything? Has anyone else had a similar issue? I noticed the symptoms get a lot worse with stress, worry, or being nervous which I have heard are common with other IBSers.

"Hi,
My problem is incomplete stool evacuation. First ""parts"" get out fast and easily (type 4-5 in bristol chart) but then there's another amount left back (deformed, mushy like type 6) and it takes 30mins+ to get rid of the latter. So if overall it was less watery and more deformed will be great.
Can you tell me what the culprits could be?
I definetly think gluten does not help me. In fact I think once all gluten is removed from my body I get back to normal, because last year I tried removing gluten and it worked after a month.

"Hi - I have had stomach issues pretty much all my life - going from contipation to boughts of ibs. Recently it has settled down but I have had a lot of trapped wind on my chest where I feel like I need to burp to release it. I have had a colonoscopy and gastroscopy and been on numerous amounts of medication...
Now the doctor has put me on an exlusion diet, but the only advise she gave me was eat white rice, fish and chicken for a wekk then start reintroducing foods 1 by 1 and keep a food diary - for anymore info go to patient.info. I don't want, nor can I afford, to have chicken or fish for 3 meals a day and have been looking to find what I could eat as a breakfast alternative but everything on the internet is contradictory (some say you can have fruit - but my doc has said no fruit due to fruit acids and I need to see if that is a trigger, others say you can have egg, others not...) I'm really confused and the next available appointment with my doctor is next week when this very restrictive section of the diet will be over anyway, and I can't delay starting it due to other comitments which a restrictive diet would not fit around. Can someone please help?!

"I have suffered with IBS on and off since a teenager (20 years), but since having my daughter it has gotten so much worse, to the point that I have been hospitalized on a few occasions. My symptoms are many, from interchanging Diarrhoea and Constipation, regular and immediate bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, bloating, headaches/migraines, flatulence, right down to the chronic abdominal pain and cramps.
Over the past 3 years it has totally taken over my life, I don’t make plans anymore, I can’t work, I am often too embarrassed or feel too rough to have friends over, I am even incapable of taking my daughter to school when I have a flare up and that can happen 3-4 times a month and last at least a few days.
I have gotten so sick of it all that I have been a nuisance to my GP and just kept bugging her to do more. Over the past year I have been poked, prodded, scanned and had numerous blood/urine tests. Nothing coming back as definitive, so a month or so ago I was sent to a dietician, who put me straight onto a Low FODMAP diet, I have been sticking to it strictly for 3 weeks in the hopes that it can relieve some of my symptoms at least a little. Well I can honestly say I have never felt worse, I have been so tired that I literally slept for a whole week only getting up for the loo, meds, food and drink, very dizzy with blurry vision, very sick, and I was breaking out in large painful boil type lumps on my back and inside leg, all this with moderate IBS symptoms too.  
So I went back to the Doctors last week and had to see a different GP, she wanted to take more blood tests to determine for some kind of blood deficiency. Turns out my sugar levels were rather high, and I now have to undergo a fasting blood test next week to diagnose for Diabetes. Having spoken to the same doctor again, my own GP and friends who have Diabetes, it seems some of the IBS symptoms I have been suffering with for many years could be attributed to Diabetes and looking back on my life I remember episodes when I would pass out, sleep a lot, get shaky hands, muscle cramps, migraines and break out in unsightly and inflamed boils or haematomas. I have also had a very weak bladder since my teenage years.
Now here is why I am posting….. both my GP and Dietician are saying to stick with the FODMAP, but I am really concerned that in doing so I will be risking making the possible Diabetes worse as it seems odd that I have been so ill since starting it. I am new to the whole Diabetes thing and its hard even thinking about dealing with that on top of the severity of my IBS, my faith in the medical profession has been shattered, my life is currently in ruins as I just have to fight to make every day as normal as possible for my daughter but as comfortable for me as I can and the last thing I want is to be even more poorly.
Thanks in advance for any replies x

"I have had a mild form of IBS for many years, linked with stress.  Over the last year or so, I have also occasionally had an extremely sharp stabbing pain in the right side of my lower abdomen.  When this occurs, I have to crawl off to bed with a heat pack until it passes - usually a couple of hours, and then I am totally fatigued for the rest of the day.
Last year, I linked it with eating too much fruit, but when on holiday in Greece, I was fine.
It has started up again recently.  I have been for an ultrasound and they say everything is fine.  The GP has tried prescribing Mebeverine and Buscopan, neither of which do anything at all.
Yesterday I had the fatigue first and when I got up, was struck down with a tremendous pain across the whole abdomen, which pretty well lasted the rest of the day.
I am so fed up with this.  I cannot do anything when the pain strikes but don't seem to be any nearer to finding out how to prevent it. (Unfortunately if it is caused by stress, the stresses in our family are permanent.)
Does anyone else suffer from this? 
I would love to hear any thoughts or ideas, thank you.

"I've been here for quite a long time trying to find something that will help my wife. Our MDs don't seem to be interested in studying this terrible malady. I'm a retired scientist, and in my work I was always attracted to problems that had not been solved. MDs don't seem to be interested in anything that does not have an established treatment. All we get is responses to symptoms. Even the Mayo Clinic has thrown up their hands and is recommending an approach that runs the gamut from accupuncture to yoga and continuing delayed reaction to symptoms with various medications. 
One gastroenterologist has explained that all the various examination tools can give is snapshots of the gut. But, he said, the dynamics of moving food through the intestines and the contractions of the musclature that does this job are not studied. It may be that this is where the cause lies. 
Does anybody here know anything about this possibility or know of any research into this?

I dont take it anymore and have had nothing until Friday when i woke at 5 am with what felt like a cold stomach. Then from 6 til 9 i was in soo much pain just under rib cage and back pain. Mebeverine didnt help and i ended up with a hot water bottle and trying different yoga poses to relieve the pain. I couldnt stand or sit and had to keep moving around and felt really sick as well. I was a bit windy but burping. Going to the loo did not improve my symptoms and have had no change in stool movements or colour. The pain suddenly ended around 9 am after taking some paracetamols. 
I dont believe this is ibs or does anyone else have the same symptoms?

"I am a 17 year old male.  I like to think of myself as healthy because I drink a lot of water and don't eat unhealthy foods (yet I don't exercise regularly, I only walk around 3-5 km a day).  I am 6 feet 1 inches tall and weigh around 170 pounds.  Anyway, i can recall symptoms of IBS since about a year ago.  I feel like I am constantly constipated.  I usually have a bowel movement 2-3 times a week.  The BM itself is about 4-5 inches long and appears normal (although sometimes it has small amounts of mucus in it).  I usually pass two of these each time I have a BM.  Aside from that, I usually get diarrhea a few times a month.  This isn't severe and usually lasts a day.  Following diarrhea I have constipation for the next few days.  I also have mild abdominal pain sometimes near my bellybutton (primarily to the lower right  of it).  I will also get a pulsing sensation in my lower left abdomen.  This is rare but when it occurs it lasts for 20 or so minutes before subsiding and restarting again later. It does this for a few hours.  Eating and exercising seem to trigger this.  It doesn't hurt and the area isnt tender or painful when I touch the pulsing area.  Same goes for the pain near my navel.  I haven't sought treatment yet mainly because the symptoms have not been painful.  They are mainly a nuisance.

"Hi there all, its the peppermint tea lady again, although this time not about peppermint tea, which personally I find very helpful.  I have something else to recommend to anyone with a prolapse or indeed problems with diarrhoea, this time its imodium or as I use the Sainsburys anti diarrhoea tablets which I find work best, basically about two years ago, the registrar at the hospital recommended I take just half an imodium a day as I had a dreadful problem with needing to open my bowels anything from 16 to 22 times a day, I am not joking thats how bad its been for four years just over, and nothing seemed to help, now I tried using a full dose of imodium or similar but found that I got very hard stools and the straining, bad with me at the best of times, just got far worse, obvious really but was put off totally from taking it again.  Anyway, recently after a particularly bad bout I thought I'll try out what the registrar said, and for the past three days have been doing just that, breaking one single tablet in half and taking it in the mornings, well, I can report, I have gone from 16/22 to now about 4-6 at most consistently and also no disturbing increase in straining at all really, so I'm just saying, prolapsed bowels are dreadful awful things to live with and if this advice helps just one person then my work is done, have a great day, Fiona

when you have diarrhoea do you bother eating or do you fast?
i've had two bouts of D. that have lasted a month each, and i try not eating but it gets to the stage im worried i'll pass out so i just eat plain things like crackers/ricecakes/bread.
when i have the odd episode i never know what to do, especially if i have to go out or to work - eat and possibly have to go more or not eat and risk fainting?
i dont want to take immodium all the time but feel better going out if ive taken it

"Hi all
i have just joined the forum and would like to share where I am at briefly.  I have had IBS-D for 4 years after many tests coming back normal, I was told that I have rapid transit, which rushes any food I eat through the small intestine very quickly without absorbing nutrients effectively. I have been on predigested Modulen over the last couple of years on and off. Now my condition as worsened and it seems that I can only manage picking at foods on occasions, which still make me ill and give me severe IBS symptoms.  Is anyone else going through this?  I have had to give up my job which was pressurised and stressful at the end of last year, but my system has not reset itself.  Is there any light at the end of tunnel?  I have very little energy, and can only manage small amounts of the nutridrinks and they make me feel ill.  I would welcome to hear anyone elses experiences, and what they are doing.  My concentration etc is minimal and can only potter at home if lucky, as due to poor posture due to condition being severe, I have developed spinal problems so cannot walk very far.  I look forward to hearing how other people are dealing with this disabling condition.  Have a lovely day all

"Hi everyone,
I'll try and keep this post as informative and compact as possible. I have questions that i just didn't think to ask my doctor when i last visited that i think can help me shed some more light on what's going on.
I've often had abdominal discomfort, usually higher up, under the breastbone - especially after eating. A few years ago i suspected a peptic ulcer but was treated instead for acid reflux with omoprazole (i think that's what it was called) and that cleared my discomfort up (at least i thought it did).
I tend to eat late at night as i don't finish work until 10pm, so in recent years when I've put my discomfort down to maybe poor eating habits and indigestion - but within the last year it has gotten progressively worse.
In December i became badly constipated and was passing blood (bright red - i beieve had developed hemmorhoids) was given mebeverine fybogel - i was tested for coeliac disease (results were negative) but the fybogel helped for a while - my doctor decided i had IBS and told me to start a food diary and manage my diet etc...
In January i became clogged up again and since then ive been having real trouble going to the toilet. I've changed my diet and haven't seen any great results. The problem i have now is that the symptoms i have could be anything and I'm at a complete loss with what to do or how to manage whatever it is that i have.
Symptoms i have are -
- upper abdominal discomfort
- constipation
- occasional visible blood in stool (90% of the time bright red - but maroon coloured a couple of times)
- decaying enamel on teeth
- always seem to have a tickly cough
- odd sensation in middle of breastbone at top of abdomen ... almost like an expanding sensation that takes my breath away tiny bit
- im usually fairly tired
- weight loss ... over a stone in the last few month
Some of these symptoms make me think I've got an ongoing GERD issue - but the only thing is i have no oesophagal issues - no heartburn or discomfort.
The worry for me is the blood in my stool - i have had hemmorhoids and it usually is when I'm constipated that i bleed, but the fact that I have had some maroon colored blood is now a concern as it tells me that that kind of blood is not from hemmorhoids - so where is it from?
The weight loss could be down to the laxatives and dietary changes I've made, but i haven't been this light for a while, so im not sure if it's caused by illness or the medication and lifestyle changes.
I'm going back to see my doctor today and am going to ask for tests to rule out more sinister causes - im aware that one of these tests is the colonoscopy and i dread it. If requested, would a virtual colonoscopy via the nhs be an option?
Does anyone else have similar issues / experiences?
Thanks for anyone taking the time to read this and anyone who replies.

"Hi there
For a couple of years I was addicted to the 30/500 co-codamol and the codeine in it gave me bad constipation, so I'd take Andrews salts for it, which gave me diarrhea, so I'd take loperimide for that and hence got into a vicious cycle, self induced IBS I guess.  So if anyone reading this is addicted to codeine in any of its forms, don't go down the road I did.
I went cold tukey off the co-codamol in November 2014, which was a traumatic but rewarding experience.  Haven't touched any opiates since then and feel like a new woman.  However, recently I've started getting constipated again and have a pain in my right lower abdomen, which according to my O level biology from the 70s, is where my large intestine is.  Its intermittant (sorry, never could spell) and I wondered if this might be a delayed after effect of all the codeine I took?
I don't know much about IBS so any advice appreciated.
Thanks

"Hi All
Just wondering about peoples experiences of IBS. I was diagnosed with IBS 10 years ago and have plodded on with it since then with it causing me minimal problems, the main ones being alternating constipation/diarrhoea, and abdo bloating, but after playing around with foood and supplements found Psyllium husks kept me regular and avoiding my favourite foods (bread and rice mainly!) minimalised the bloating, I didnt completely cut them out but I knew if I ate them I would feel bloated and a bit rubbish the rest of the day, but they didnt really have any effects on my bowels.
Anyway, the past few years I have been getting more issues rectally in the guise of pain. The alternating constipation/diarrhoea still remains, but I also find now when the constipation strikes I sometimes feel like my bowel has just stopped working completely, like I will get the urge to go, and feel cramps in my upper stomach, but the lower bowel just doesnt move. When it finally releases the pain is horrific. I am also getting alot of pain, an increased amount abdominally (I have discomfort most of the time, and it generally feels worse after any bowel movement. The bloating is also present more often), and the worst of it is rectal pain. I get a degree of pain on opening my bowels, which I have acredited to an anal fissure, as have had a lot of bleeding in the past with some bowel movements which was sorted with GTN cream, but I can cope with this pain. What I am struggling to cope with is pain I get that starts approximately 30 minutes after a bowel movement and stays for potentially hours afterwards. It is a rather severe stabbing pain, and if I should need to have a bowel movement close to bed time it will either prevent me sleeping or wake me from sleep. Analgesia does not help. I thought it might be due to an internal haemorrhoid I believe I have which descends every time I open my bowel, but my GP seems to think this would not cause this degree of pain.
Finally for the last few weeks I have also been experiencing near constant nausea, and quite a bit of vomitting, sometimes after meals (not always especially big ones, but  if I eat a big meal I suffer afterwards), but sometimes just in the mornings after taking the psyllium husks (sorry for the mental image, but I just bring up the 300mls of water and partially disolved capsules. Its not plesent). This has only started recently and I put it down to stress irritating my IBS further (new job, training, and the whole worry with the rectal pain), but have never had this before with IBS. I am taking omeprezole, which I have been on for about 2 years for acid reflux. I do tend to find I feel less nauseous eating little and often, but when I am at work this is just not possible to achieve. I've not lost any  unintentional weight recently (mores the pity!).
Do these symptoms strike a chord with anyone else? I'm thinking it is just an exacerbation of my IBS, but theres just so much going on!
Any thoughts/ experiences greatly appreciated.

"Just adding to the debate. At the age of 65 I appear to have developed IBS, at least I have all the classic symptoms; rumbling stomach, cramps, constipation. In the last month I've had three attacks which have been very uncomfortable (that's an understatement!) and caused extreme lack of sleep/total exhaustion. In desperation I tried taking good, old fashioned Alka Seltzer and I have to say it appeared to work. Not immediately, but over about an hour or so the rumblings started to subside. I mentioned this to my GP, who gave me one of those superior smiles, that tell you you're talking nonsense, and then prescribed Gaviscon. Yesterday I had another attack; rumblings starting in the morning and cramps developing in the early evening. Took Gaviscon; no discernible relief! Went to bed exhausted and slept fitfully for three hours to be woken with the pains unchecked. After another three hours awake and cramping decided to try another Alka Seltzer - asleep within the hour and woke with symptoms gone. Coincidence? I don't know but I don't work for Alka Seltzer and have no axe to grind ( except, possibly, against Gaviscon!) there's probably no medical reason why it should work but, given that the medical profession doesn't seem to have any real answers.......... Personally, I'm off to my friendly local pharmacy to stock up on Alka Seltzer!!! You could try it too, you've nothing to lose and it might work for you - keep me posted.

I saw the best doctors, I did hypnosis, took antidepression pills, i went to a psy..but nothing helped. I don't fell depressed at all.

I have been posting on other groups for a while now. Long story short is that I have been having upper left pains under my ribs that radiate around into my ribs at the back. I have upper right pains that radiate into my shoulder. I have lower back pains. I have pains in my lower abdomen. To an inch right of my belly button. Then it moves to and inch left of my belly button. I have stabbing below my belly button too.
I am windy, bloated. I have had loose stools for the past 7 months. These are ribbon thin, ragged edges but normal stool colour. Sometimes they may go a little lighter if the pain on my right has been bad. My weight fluctuates badly. I can be 8 and 1/2 stone one day and 9 stone the next. My weight day by day fluctuates by 2-3kgs. I can loose weight really fast. But really struggle to put any on.
I have some heart burn with spicy foods and if I take ibrofen.
I am vitamin d deficient - on maintenance therapy.
I am not suffering from malabsorbtion (ive been tested)
I have had numerous scans and blood tests - all normal. Including a stool sample for IBD.
I saw the consultant as it had prevously been thrown in the mix that I could have chronic pancreatitis. But the consultant I sae yesterday said no its IBS. He's doing endoscopy and colonoscopy to check but he's pretty certain on his diagnosis.
I have tried buscopan with no real effect. I tried symprove as I had read this is good. Saw no real benefit. I have tried live natural yoghurt.
Does this sound like IBS? Does anyone have any identical pain zones as me? Anyone have any other ideas of what it could be? (Gallbladder, liver and kidneys were all nornal too)

"Hi all hope some one can help.
When I was on foods that was making me unwell I would get all the usual IBS complaints stomah cramping just after eating food plus bloating and belching but never much wind.
That was when I was not adding raw cold pressed oils to each meal.
But since adding raw cold pressed oil to each meal I no longer get belching or much trouble but what i am getting now is quite a lot of wind the other way.
Has anyone else had this and found out why.
The only answer i can come up with in this suden change is maybe my belching turning to farting is a result of wind being trapped because I've never added the correct amount of oils to meals before or fats and as a result of me now adding the oil it helping my body to relieve wind through the right way down rather than up.
My theory is perhaps because I wasn't adding oils to meals I was getting trapped wind and now its not trapped because the oil is helping it come out.
I wondered if this is quite common or a sign that basically I have a Berry sensitive tummy but I can live with just wind.
Or could I still gave something I need to be checked out for.
And if anyone could help me out with the recomended 5 to 1 ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 oils found in opils.
Health standards suggest that you get more omega 6 than omega 3 to your diet.
The recommended in take is to include oil that has more omega 6 than omega 3 and to this at a 5 to one ratio when having healthy oil with your meal does anyone know a goodethod for this

"I'm a 29 year old woman.
Last Saturday after a really nice meal I've noticed that I was having a dull ache in my upper abdomen, center - slightly more left. It felt like a dull ache, vaguely crampy. 
Not an acute pain, I could continue my activities normally, but it felt like something was tender and achey inside the abdomen, kind of like when you get hit in the plexus and you have that tender feeling and can't breathe deeply.
In the evening this sensation disappeared but starting from then now I get it occasionally during the day. I can feel it around 1/2 of the day. More often after eating, although there were 2 occasions in which I ate but didn't get the discomfort. 
It a vague discomfort, nothing to bend me over. Sometimes I can feel it more deeply towards the back. I feel like I need to breathe more deeply.
I eat normally and have a normal appetite. I don't feel fullness after eating, no heartburn, no nothing. 
I've never had stomach problems before, so I don't know what this can be? 
Last abdominal ultrasound was 3 months ago and it was normal.
Can this be IBS related? I have bad IBS in my intestines, colon is always swollen and spastic (I can palpate it easily when lying down) and I suffer from anxiety. 
I'm worried about pancreatic cancer, but I assume that would be unlikely? I just don't see how this could be the stomach, as usually when I get stomach issues it feels differently, like indigestion - but this is not indigestion, my digestion is just fine. No bloating, no burping.

From yesterday, it feels like at times, a painless twitching occurs in my stomach, left side where the stomach organ is located, it feels like it twitches, like 1 big twitch followed by a bunch of smaller twitches....I dont feel any pain or discomfort, but it got my health anxiety out of control yesterday....never had it before (well not that I remember although it is possible) and just knowing that it is a common symptom of IBS would be very re-assuring.
I dont know how to describe it other than a twitching or perhaps spasm of the actual stomach organ itself....again, no pain or discomfort.

"I'm a student, and have nearly finished my first year in university, I travel to university by myself and for the last 2 months I have been suffering with severe discomfort in the car as I've been experiencing a sudden urge to empty my bowels when driving, which can be difficult when stuck in traffic as there is nowhere to stop, I get a nauseas sensation and severe abdominal cramping then the sudden urge to go, I have never suffered with this problem before, so I tried to keep track of what I was eating, I cut out carbonated drinks and fatty greasy foods, as I thought they may be a cause but I noticed no change, I went to the doctor and she told me it may be anxiety as it happened once and the fear of it becoming an ongoing problem may be all in my head, the second doctor I seen diagnosed me with bowel overflow and prescribed me fibre drinks, they didn't work and have recently seen a third doctor for her to give me tablets for IBS bowel spasms but they haven't made much of a difference as I had blood taken and they came back normal, I am at my wits end, I am terrified to drive anywhere, I don't go out and I even tried to stop eating which made me feel even worse, I am considering paying privately to see a specialist as I feel really depressed, its taking over my life, I used to be happy and outgoing and loved driving everywhere now I feel like I fear for the future. Can anyone help me??

"I'm a student, I'm stressed out alot of the time and I have had recent anxiety issues. The symptoms to my illness feel different now. I don't know whether to call it pain or just an overwhelming discomfort along with the sudden urge to defecate. It's changed. One part of the last week I was constipated. I couldn't go at all, and the only time I would go, it was only this mucus-like substance that came out. Then the last part of the week I couldn't stop going. I was going alot more than I usually would. And even after I already went, I would Sometimes get the Same feeling again. But now I feel like it's happening all over again and I really want it to stop. I don't feel nausea too much but I do have quite a bit of gas. Its just very uncomfortable, And painful, feeling like I have to go all the time. Is it possible IBS? Anyone with the Same symptoms?

"Son was diagnosed with severe pan UC 11 months ago. Had an iron transfusion and has been on IV and oral steroids, sulfasalazine, mesalazine, azathioprine and now infliximab. The infliximab is working in that his colon is in remission BUT 3 weeks after his initial diagnosis (June 2014) he suddenly had absolutely no energy and consequently spent 6 months on the couch.
In dec 2014 we attributed the fatigue to the cocktail of drugs he was on and withdrew the azathioprine (infliximab continued) : temporary improvement and now he is suffering deep fatigue again and is missing school again. 
He does not suffer tummy pain or ongoing diarrhoea : his only real symptom is crippling fatigue which is now affecting his mental well being. We are very concerned on a way forward for him.
Does anyone have any suggestions, has this happened to your child? Very grateful for any suggestions.

"Hi!
I was diagnosed with IBS due to bloating & wind and swinging between loose bowels & constipation a few years ago
4 months ago in November I started getting these episodes which are a lot lot worse, that start with nausea & stomach ache, then diarreah would start along with the most cripppling stomach cramps I've ever had, I'm on the loo for about 6-12 hours straight each time with yellow liquid diarreah flooding out of me & vomiting into a bucket as I can't get off the loo along with awful sulphur gas coming out of my mouth, bum bleeding due to the non stop diarreah. Then 12-24 hours later it all stops and everything goes back to normal (normal for me being bloating & wind swinging between loose bowels & constipation, but manageable). I have had between 1 and 3 of these horrible episodes a month since November, at first I thought I was getting frequent stomach bugs or food poisoning but it's not that. End of Nov they checked my stools and no virus, bacteria or parasite, just been back to doctors today as I'm getting fed up of these episodes as they render me completely helpless and often I can't work or even look after my little boy as i'm literally stuck on the loo all day groaning in pain. He had a listen to my tummy and said it's pretty severe IBS and gave me IBS meds so hopefully they will help
Do these episodes sound like IBS still? I had gotton used to my IBS being a constant annoying thing but these are something else! I can't figure out what's triggering them either there seems to be no common trigger & I'm not stressed. Just wanted a bit of insight from others I guess Xx

"I apologize in advance about this being a bit long, I have a quite a few questions and I would really like to know how likely it is that I have IBS or if my symptoms point towards something else.
So I'm 23 years old and since about January this year I started having the problem of alternating between having diarrhea and being constipated. Before this year my bowel movements have always been normal (I very rarely ever had diarrhea). It wasn't until I was in the car with my boyfriend and I started having a really agonizing stomach ache that I got really worried. Also I don't know if it could be related at all, but around April last year I had suddenly had overwhelmingly bad stomach pain, so bad that I called an ambulance. The doctor at the hospital said I probably had an ovarian cyst that burst as my mum has had ovarian cysts. The pain went away after taking panadeines. (When I went to see my doctor she was pretty unhelpful and just said it may not have been an ovarian cyst and it could've just been a one off thing that can happen when a woman has her period).
So anyway after the bad stomach ache in the car I got a blood test done and everything came back normal, and then I eventually had a stool test and it came back saying I had Salmonella, but just the regular type that is meant to come and go within a week or so. Because my stomach problems were already so bad I didn't even notice any difference having Salmonella, as I wasn't vomiting. Anyway these are the symptoms that I've been experiencing constantly for the last 3 months:
- Alternating between diarrhea and constipation, having severe stomach aches and diarrhea usually every 2-4 days and usually being constipated the rest of the time. The stomach ache eventually eases after going to the toilet about 1-4 times
- Sometimes nausea, feeling very tired, occasional headaches
- Often having little appetite and getting full quickly when I try to eat a decent sized meal (but I'm not sure if this is just due to the fact that I often go days eating very little)
- My stomach gurgles and churns constantly especially when I eat/after I eat, and sometimes when I need to eat - I'm curious to know if people experience this a lot as I haven't really seen it listed as a common IBS symptom? and I find it quite uncomfortable
- Occassionally I experience this odd feeling in my stomach that sort of feels like a small throbbing sensation, it usually only lasts a few seconds... Does anyone else have any idea what I'm talking about/experience this? It may just be part of my stomach being unsettled but it's an odd feeling.
- At times I've had pain/discomfort in my very lower abdomen, lower than where I get stomach aches, although I haven't noticed this very much in the last month or so.
Other things I want to mention..
I don't have any acid reflux, I never have any pain in my chest it's always in my stomach.
Sometimes when I have a burning, less severe stomach ache, I find that passing urine helps. Is this odd?
I also find that when I have very severe stomach aches, the only thing that seems to help a bit besides using the toilet, is drinking water. Is this usual/do other people found this helpful?
I haven't tried any sort of pills to help with the stomach aches yet but my doctor prescribed me Colofac tablets. Are these likely to be helpful?
I also have a lot of anxiety and tend to worry a lot about things in general.
I managed to go a whole week I think without having any severe stomach aches and I was eating very bland foods mostly, though I still draink fizzy drinks. Then I ate some chips and two chocolate biscuits, and bam, two hours later I had a severe stomach ache and diarrhea. So I've decided I'm definitely cutting those two things out of my diet, and I'm going to look into doing the FODMAP diet thing.
But I feel like I need to get more tests done as I'm still worried it could be something more severe causing my problem. My doctor is quite useless and hasn't suggested getting more tests done but I'm going to ask to next time I go. Though I'm really not sure what other things I'd need to be tested for. But with everything I have described, does it sound like it's very likely IBS?
One other question I had is, I've also had pinworms for the last two years (haven't been able to get rid of them due to my current living situation). Could this be likely to be causing my stomach problems? All my doctor said when I asked her was a very vague ""yes it could be"".
Thankyou very much in advance to anyone that replies

"Hello
My trouble started 6months a go when I had a stomach virus and then another throat virus. It's been 6 months and I have had so many different symptoms of feeling unwell and so many different diagnosis from ME to lymes disease! Now I think it's come down to having acid reflux with no heartburn. Just nausea, burping and throat gurgling and discomfort. I can also feel generally unwell with a flu/virus feeling with dizziness. I was only getting it every few days but now I get it most evenings despite eating less and avoiding acidic foods. I took 2x 20mg Omeprozole for a month and decided it wasn't doing much at all. Now I am on 2x150mg ranitidine, which helps the nausea but I now get bad stomach cramps and am tired all the time and finding it hard to work. I am also coming to the end of a gluten free diet (which gave me more energy to start but now it's the opposite). I don't think the gluten free diet has helped. I am so anxious and down because I have a phobia of being sick and so the nausea is horrible. I am unwell every day with these symptoms and am going to see an expensive private gastroenterologist, as nothing seems to make a huge difference. I also have had IBS for years and had it under control and it was even improving. Now the doctor suggests this is IBS with an upper GI tendency. I think it's acid reflux or LPR (silent reflux) as I stop taking the ranitidine and nausea returns. I tried to cut ranitidine down to one a day instead of two to see if stomach cramps got better as I wasn't having them before this med. I think it may have helped but nausea returns. Maybe I should take Omeprozole but a smaller dose ( maybe some effects made me think tablet wasn't working) or try Esomeprazole. Ive read studies saying this is better? I'm at my wits end and am so unhappy. Can anyone give any advice or share their experience? I question if I even have gerd. I've had h pylori test, Coeliac disease test, numerous blood tests..all negative. Awaiting Crohns and SIBO test results. Need to find the right med, the right diet and have an endoscopy to check everything inside. However in the meantime I'm miserable and so far 6 months of investigations haven't worked. Any help out there? Thanks in advance.

"Hi all,
So I've been diagnosed through exclusion via blood tests and stool tests.
However I'm still not convinced I have IBS.
My symptoms are none stop for the past 4 months  - maybe a few times I've had a 'nearly,' normal stool.
More than not it's craming in the morning, lots of smelly flatulence,  period type cramps - followed by a need to be on the toilet - followed by either soft stools (never diaherroa) or constipation. (I prefer the constipation)  Then after that I'm fine for the rest of the day unless i eat bread or drink coffee.  I get bloating but it's normally gone after I go to the toilet.
However I seem to be bloated a lot lately - even after drinking water.
I""m sooo very over this. I've had bad bowels most of my life but following a sh$#ty year with custody issues etc and having an anxiety disorder on top of that - this year has been pretty bad with what has been coined my IBS.
I've made my Dr give me a form to get a CT Colonoscipy - he didn't want to do it but said it was more for me than for him.
However I'm starting to panic about it being something else - specifically OC.
The symptoms sound the same as OC ... my Dr has given me an internal and told me they feel fine but that doesnt' mean anything.
It also seems that food doesn't truly correlate with bad bowels either.
I can eat a burger and my stools is semi fine the following day but then I can only eat salads and healthy food and I pain and loose stools!
Any help or if you're similiar that would be great to hear.
I'm losing my mind with worry.

"Hi everyone. 
I have recently just been told that the symptoms I have been experiencing over a period of time, are probably down to IBS. The doctor I saw, wasn't the most helpful, which was slightly irritating, as you expect to get a level of support from them, but she nonetheless, seemsed very disinterested with what I was trying to tell her. 
Luckily for me, I'd done my own research on my symptoms and the likely conditions that they could be down to, so I just needed her to confirm what it was that was wrong. 
But the reason I'm posting is because, I have a hunch that maybe I could be gluten intolerant, Ot that gluten could flare up my IBS symptoms. 
As of late I've been experiencing a weird sensation at the bottom of my ribs/top of my tummy. It almost feels as though I'm waiting for my belly to rumble, but, it never does, I feel like maybe to I need to burp, but when I do burp, the pain doesn't subside. I've also been getting a very tight, cramping sensation in and around my ribs, which makes me feel like my insides are contracting. 
The cramping sensation I've got, or get, I've associated with guten intolerance. The reason being, because it almost certainly comes on everytime I've eaten something with gluten in. Now, I've been tested for Coeliac disease, but my results came back fine,
So, I was just wondering if there was anybody else who had the same kind of problems or any expereince that may help? I'm trying now to cut as much gluten out of my diet as possible to see if it is that that is causing my pain.

"Hi everyone,
Im hoping someone can help me as im starting to get a bit concerned. Im 19, 5""8, 125 pounds and up to the start of my symptons i went to the gym 5 times a week and over the past year i have become a big health freak and totally changed my diet.
Almost a month a go i suffered what i believe was an extreme allergic reaction and from googling (i know you shouldnt!!) i had all the symptons of an anaphylactic shock. I am certain it was from fruit as the symptons came on around 15 minutes after i had a fruit salad i made with strawberries, raspberries, pineapple, mango and grapes in. (I already avoid bananas as everytime i eat one i suffer from extreme bloating and end up being sick and/or diarrhea) Over the course of 8 hours, until i went to sleep, i had cold sweats, then i was boiling hot and then cold again, bloating, developed a rash on my arm, dizziness, nausea and then sickness, diarrhea and then my chest tightened up, i could hardly breathe and it brought asmtha-attack like symptons on (i do suffer from asmtha). I was driving when this happened and just rushed home as i didnt know what to do. When i got home i was sick and had diarrhea and then i had a constant acid like burn in my throat for the following 2 days - i guess thats just from being sick. I also developed eczema on my neck and still have this now, it flares up sometimes but i have never suffered from this before.
When i woke up i was ok apart from my stomach which still felt a bit iffy but that didnt surprise me.
I went to my GP and he basically said nothing can be done as 'i am a young, healthy girl with no family history of this problem' but said he will just send me for a blood test as nothing else can be done and doesnt like doing allergy tests as they are hard to find!?! My white blood cell count came back satisfactory and i am awaiting the other test results.
I have eaten each fruit seperatly since this happened to see if i get any of these effects and i did get a bit of stomach ache after eating mango and pineapple but im starting to think its now developed into something else (if possible?!) as the stomach ache has never gone away since, every day i had an ache in my stomach, which flares up and i get sharp pains or an acid like burn - but not necessarily after i eat anything, it just comes and goes.
I have also had dizzy spells, hot flushes and bad fatigue since this occured.
I have eaten fruit all my life which is also why im thinking it wasnt the fruit but i just dont know what else could have caused that???  I do drink a lot of coffee but always have drank cit, although i do feel i am dependant on it as i get headaches when i dont have any.
I am starting to think maybe its IBS as dairy products do effect me - i cannot have cream and cheese and milk makes me very bloated and makes me need the toilet. I don't eat any bread, rice, pasta etc, i only eat oats for breakfast which contains gluten??
Sorry for the long post, i just hope someone can help me. It's effecting my moods, i constantly feel upset and down as i can always feel an ache in my stomach and always bloated and has stopped me from going to the gym which is also getting me down. 
Thank you for any help, it will be appreciated x

"hiya im new to this group and wanted to ask some advice as I have reached rock bottom now. I was diagnosed with IBS about a year ago now and am taking Colofac MR and loperamide which to begin with seemed to work but I would still have the odd bout of uncontrollable stomach cramps and on a couple of occasions I had accidents on my way to work on the bus, it was awful, the worst experience of my life. I wasn't very happy at work at the time so put it down to that as the reason for the flare up. I changed job within the company and it eased off again. Unfortunately my new job hasn't worked out how I had hoped and I'm under even more pressure than previously, that and im having troubles at home with my teenage daughters behaviour and having to take her to the police for the things she has done. I have sudden periods of dizziness to the point I feel like I will pass out and uncontrollable urges to cry, this can happen at any time and is horrendous because I don't know the trigger or how to stop it. I went back to the doctor 2 weeks ago who signed me off work for 2 weeks and put me in touch with Italk and discussed CBT and the possibility of antidepressants. I go back to see her tomorrow, I wanted to avoid antidepressants but I'm now at the stage that I feel nervous doing the things I have always enjoyed, like going out with my best friend and my driving lessons. I really enjoy my driving lessons and have booked my test as this is my key to changing career and being happier in life but just lately I have been confined to the toilet prior to lessons which I have never experienced before. Im really scared that it will cause me to to fail my test but if I go on antidepressants I'm worried that the side effects may also cause me to be unable to drive. I'm stuck in a vicious circle and wondered if anyone else had been in the same situation as me?

"Hello,
I already posted about my experience a few weeks ago, and I would like some advice about comprehensive stool analysis.
To sum up, I have been feeling bad for about 2 years now, after an episode of gastroenteritis/food poisoning. My symptoms are mainly the same as a chronic gastritis: stomach bloating, especially after meals, acid reflux sometimes, but also fatigue, and skin rashes.
I have tried a lot of medication, all the time ineffective and making me even more ill sometimes. Now doctors just tell me I have post infectious IBS and they are not able to help at all. I had blood tests, gastroscopy, intolerance tests, etc. but no stool analysis.
So my question is, would a comprehensive stool analysis be useful and what can I expect from it?
Thank you

"Hi, ill try to tell my long story short. Im 27 years old male, fit, not drinking, quit from smoking last year, never had any problems with my stomach, just used to fell bloated and windy sometimes after meals, but last two years things changed. Its started with acid reflux, because i wasn't eating very healthy, i was eating before bed a lot etc, then acid reflux gone worse, went to my gp, she gave me omeprozole, but its just made my symptoms worse, after i went to another doctor he put camera inside my stomach and diagnosed chronic gastritis, gave me nexium and ranitidine. Medicine helped a bit, i took it for 3months, after stopped symphtoms came back, but this time i was felling weak after eating, dizzy, especially if i drink milk even lactose free milk or any dairy product i feel dizzy after 2-4 hours or if I eat oats then I dont go to toilet for 2 days or if i go i get pencil thin stools, I even had a little blood in stool, but doctor said its because of hard poo. Anyway now i learned what i can eat and what i cant eat. At the moment (last 1.5 years) im eating very healthy, still keeping fit, im on high fiber diet, which helps with bowel movements, but still cant get rid of acid in my mouth(sour taste) after eating or sometimes right side abdominal (colon) pain (actually it happened today first time after very large bowel movement. Last week went to see doctor again, he gave me more medicines, one of them is enzymes which i fell helps to digest food more easy then he did full blood test , still waiting for results. I thought maybe you could tell me is it possible to have ibs or any food intolerance or to toxic colon or even colon cancer... please, thanks

"I first started experiencing IBS symptoms 8/9 years ago went to the GP and they done nothing at first. Then a few years later the symptoms got worse so I went back, they put it down to my gallbladder this time, so that got removed.
Which in fact did not help the symptoms at all. So again another trip to the GP, after a million and one tests ( no colonoscopy as they refused to give me one ) they then suggested IBS. There after I was introduced to a cocktail of drugs and got told ""it takes a while to find the right one"" I am currently on amitriptyline and lopremide and I feel there of no help. I have tried almost all diets known to help IBS and had no luck. This has altered my life, I'm anxious to eat when I'm out, if i do go out I'm constantly worried incase I need the toilet.

Since around Jan. I have been dealing with burning in under my upper right side and slighlty below it. Literally feels like something in there is inflammed and it feels bloated more so on that side. I have always suffered from constipation so in the begining I thought it was gas since I kept feeling an exsessive amount of it rumbling around in my tummy. I went to the Dr who wanted me to get an u/s to check my gallbladder. I wasn't able to do it right away.
I finally got the abdominal ultrasound a couple weeks ago. At this point the pain as not let up. It felt as though it was burning,gnawing, and sometimes achy. It would radiate to the right side of my upper back to my shoulder and a bit below my rib cage area. It really started to worry me. 2 days after the u/s I went to the er because I was just at my wits end with the pain! I had a urinalysis and several other blood tests ran including a cbc. All test came back normal and the er dr. had me confused he said my u/s was normal but then he mentioned gallbladder enlarged and sludge. I THOUGHT he was talking about me I mean he even did that whole Murphy sign test where they have you take a deep breath while pressing into the area where your gallbladder is. It hurt! He said it was pretty obvious to him it was my GB. Hm. Anyway he refers me to a surgeon who  explains to me that my u/s was negative! He wanted me to go get a HIDA scan because he himself even thought it sounded like my GB. I've been dealing with this uncomfortable pain every single day since I wrote the very first post here btw. Got my results on the HIDA yesterday and they told me it was normal. I was so upset because I thought for sure I finally had an answer to my pain and could get treatment soon. Now I have to go get a scope done and I am becoming depressed. I wake up everyday hoping this pain will just be gone but it isn't. It's interfering with my day to day life and I have 3 kids ages 8,6, and 4 so it is not easy feeling like poo all the time. I am fatigued and sometimes feel as though I am coming down with something, even run a 99.4-99.6 temp.
So after all this does anyone still think it could be IBS?
I don't know. I mean I am so scared it's something like an ulcer or something else. I would think that IBS would ease up at some point wouldn't it? Would it just stay in one spot like this burning and aching and 'sometimes' a sharp pain (though the sharp pain is very rare.)
Sorry so long and I thank you ahead of time for any replies.
Sorry so long everyone I am just in a mood and venting.

"Hi guys,
I've read numerous times about the different types of IBS but for many, many years I've been affected by starting approx 3 days a week (constipated other days) with a normal-ish bm only to end up with diarrhea accompanied by wickedly painful spasms.  I end up being off & on the loo for hours on the day of a bm. Very rarely I do have a 'normal' bm.  
This problem is/has always been so debilitating that working away from home has never been an option for me.   I've seen many GP's and a few specialists, had a hemarroidectomy last year (no bleeding now and a little less pain thanks to this op) but the spasms/diarrhea persists.  My current GP prescribed Mebeverine last week but it's made the problem worse.
Do any of you suffer this pattern of IBS?  
I do have other health issues - RA, Lupus & Fibro.  On annual Rituximab infusions, prednisone, Leflunomide, Losec, Amitriptyline.

"Hi all,
I am hoping someone can provide any insight to the following. Sorry if it is long-winded.
I have had some ongoing issues for the last couple of months or so.
I am 37 have generally had symptoms of IBS since 2008, when I had a bad bout of diarrhoea and some blood (which was an anal fissure at that time) after eating a certain oat*bix cereal.
On and off I have had persistent symptoms, especially with dairy foods, ever since. I had some food intolrance tests done and it was the milk itself I was intolerant to, not just the lactose.
Anyway from November 2014 I had some bouts of my stomach being very tender to touch, upset stomach, and pains in my sides and back (tenderness).
I have been to the Doctor and told everything from Costochondritis, IBS, Kidney infection (which turned out to be negative). Had blood tests done at now ex-GP surgery in December and January, all OK apart from a slightly raised CRP level (an inflammation marker), and a little high potassium from the Kidneys. Heliobacter Pylori and TGT Coeliac were negative.
The pains got worse, especially ribs, and I went back to the GP and they said my lower ribs are short in lengthe and probably digging in to something ""come back if it get's worse"".
Just before Christmas I got very bloated after a meal out with my Nan (had Fish & Chips) and then on Christmas Day had terrible stomach tenderness and diarrhoea that had alot of undigested mushrooms in it (I had eaten them the day before, not had a problem before that). Also a couple of times a kind of pinching/squeezing sensation just below my left ribs at the side. Like a throbbing pinch someone squeezing then letting go and then repeating it.
Went back to the Doctor and told to take Buscopan for Bowels and given Naproxen for ribs - oh my god the Naproxen nearly ripped my stomach apart! I had advised NSAID's hurt my stomach but he thought they'd be ok.
In January the pains in ribs and sides got so tender it was almost unbearable. Went back to GP and did an upper abdominal ultrasound at Hospital. Everything looked ok (gallbladder, liver, spleen etc). Couldn't see my pancreas on the screen. Left Kidney is ok and normal but my right Kidney is shrunken and scarred looking.
Ended up at out of hours GP who suggested both Gastro and also Urlogy, but local GP said I could only do one at a time. Chose Gastro.
Click here to view image
I ended up back at my old GP in the next town who advised Vitamin D, B12, Folate (Folic Acid), Calprotectin as none of these had been done. I have since gone back under the care of my old GP practice. He was almost bang on too- B12 and a couple of others were OK, but I had low folate and quite low vitamin D (level 25 which is low insuffcient, borderline deficient). I am on prescription for high dose Folic acid and Vitamin D3. Calprotectin was mid range at 26.7 - unlikely to be Crohn's, Colitis or anything else inflammatory in the bowel.
Phew, or so I thought!
For the past few weeks my stools have been getting quite narrow. Sometimes they start thicker and then go thin, other times just thin. I can normally see undigested vegetable etc and some mucous. In the morning they are light brown and if I need to go later in the day tend to be normal brown.
Yesterday I got in from work and had a bout of diarrhoea which seemed to float and was a little frothy/foamy. Then later in the evening I thought I needed to go again but all that was in the toilet was clear mucous with blood. Panicked a bit. This morning it was narrow stool with mucous and blood in it.
I went to the GP and have to do another stool sample to rule out infection or bugs, and await the Gastro appointment in mid-march.
I was convinced at first it was coeliac or one of the IBD's, but tests are showing this is not the case. It isn't my Kidneys as they are functioning well. Apart from trying to increase my fibre intake by a little, and taking the Folic Acid and Vitamin D doses, I haven't done much else.
Can anyone please comment and see if they have experienced anything similar? Many thanks for reading.

I have recently been diagnosed with IBS - I think Ive had it forever but Dr finally said IBS.
My issue; and I""ve had enough of it to be honest, is that I have IBS all the time.
I never get a break.
I'm either constipated or loose stools.
Right now I'm constipated but when I do go it's soft and gross.
I""m so over it.
My stomach feels 'off,' all the time.
I can't eat anything as it makes me feel sick.
I have a 3 year old and I'm losing my mind.
I'm going back to the Dr again to demand a colonoscopy as I haven't had one.
I have done everything else though and they all came back clear.
Does anyone else go through this with IBS?
I hear of people only have flare ups every now and then but mine has been almost 8 months.
I""ve had maybe 1 weeks of normality and even then it was only 'more' normal than what I was experiencing.
I'm worried it's colon cancer or something else.
Can anyone help?

"Just a brief update as i posted up about this subject earlier on last week, I am continuing with having a couple of cups of the PG Tips pyramid bags of peppermint tea, as they seem to be the best quality ones, £1 for 20 from Asda, I have diverticular desiese, prolapsed bowel and really chronic IBS most probably resultantly and have tried aloe vera, silicol gel, and various other products on the market with no effect but find keeping up a couple of regular cups of the peppermint really does help, I regularly, without the tea, visit the loo up to 24 times a day, and usually daily about 16 plus, this is no joke nor exaggeration on my part so you can understand how greatful I am to a good quality peppermint tea as this seems to keep it down to about 6 to 8 provided I keep it up, two or three a day, I don't know if this helps anyone, as I say I have posted before but thought some of you would be interested to know I am still improving on this regime, I'm a big coffee drinker and don't have the inclination to give it up as I really enjoy it but substituting a couple with the tea is really really beneficial, but use PG Tips as the pyramid bags circulate better than standard, theirs are stronger in any case and have  a little string so its a piece of cake to leave the bag in the cup for even more strength, goodness!!  - I sound like an advertisement, sorry!!  But they are really good!

"Hi all, really hope someone can help me!
A few years ago, I started having excruciating pain during my periods, sti test was negative, ultrasound showed nothing of concern. It lasted about a year and went away. 13 months ago I started getting the same trouble, again every test was negative, was told possible endometriosis and to monitor.
On dec 15th 2014, after my period I developed pain in my left abdomen, by my ovary. The pain got more severe, it felt like a knotting twisting pain, I had backache, hip pain, nausea, dizzyness and lightheaded ness. The pain kept increasing and I was referred to a ob/gyn and I paid privately to see him.
He examined me and told me he felt a cyst on my left ovary and my uterus was deviated to the right because of the cyst. I was referred for an urgent CA125 and ultrasound.
I had both, with the ultrasound being both internal and external. The results went back to my GP who told me that neither ovary could be seen.
During this time my pain had got a lot worse, it was very sudden and severe, making me feel like I was going to vomit or pass out, severe hip pain and all other previous symptoms. I also can't wear anything apart from leggings now, tight clothes cause the excruciating pain, as well as doing too much, ie I'm a hairdresser and after a few cuts I'm in agony, hence I'm not currently working for anyone and self employed to help this.
Today I had my appt with my ob/gyn. I felt that he couldn't give me any time. He wasn't interested in my symptoms or how severe the pain had become. He told me I have no gynae issue, after a very quick examination and have me IBS tablets? He had no reason as to where the supposed cyst has gone. I saw him on the NHS this time, instead of private and I feel that he was annoyed by that and gave me the tablets just to get me out of his hair as I can't afford to pay.
Has anyone been told they have a cyst before and then told actually they didn't and had IBS? I'm so confused!

"Hey everyone! I have recently joined the group as I am at my wits end.
i have had bowel problems for nearly 12 years now, and have had a colonscopy 3 years ago which was clear accept for diverticulitis diease.
as the past 3 months it has really got bad I suffer with constipation, pellet like stools and maybe don't go to the toilet for 4 days at a time. Then when I do get my stools are little bits, soft and light brown - yesterday I went 5 times.i always have the feeling of needing to go and wind which can be mucus.
The worst part is the pain, it's always across my lower pelvic area, it's cramping, annoying and sore. I possibly think this is from straining too much to be honest. I am feeling low at the minute as I am worried it is something more serious. I have another consultant apt on Wednesday but not holding much hope as I never seem to get anywhere at all. I suffer aniexty which doesn't help too abd the other night came across a picture of a colon cancer bowel movement looked exactly like mine do. Only thing I not panicking is I know it can take bowel cancer 10 years plus to formation and I had my colonscopy 3 years ago.

"over the passed years and after research and talking to doctors I've realised I have IBS. I never suffer with dihorea, just constipation.
Whenever I go to have a bowel movement, I'm straining for so long and nothing happens. I then go back to bed and half an hour later I'll feel the urge to go again and sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. All this straining can put me on the road for a water infection which drives me insane because I get them so often. However, if I can calm my IBS down then I should be able to steer clear of water infections.
I'm pretty sure it's triggered by anxiety which I can get on and off.
I kept a food diary and have realised things like too much dairy will make it worse, I should eat more veg that citrus fruits, things that contain oats help and lots of water helps (I drink around 2L a day).

I know you can get IBS at any age and piles at any age but I am only 18 and I have really bad constipation, to the point I couldn't pass any stool for seven days, a whole week. Its like my body just isnt breaking down my food at all, I dred going to the toilet, I cry a lot because its so painful and even worse now I've managed to get another pile, I can hardly fit a finger up there, let alone pass any stool. I have been dealing with this since I was 14, I had a mentally abusive boyfriend at that time and he would make me have anal sex when I didnt want to but I did it because of the mental state he would put me in and ever since our relationship ended I have had constipation, anal bleeding, piles, stomach aches, feeling tired, depressed. Its ruined my every day to day life. I have changed my diet, ive done everything, the creams etc but nothing seems to work.

I too have IBS have had iot now for over 25 years .Throughout  all these years I have taken no prescribed  medicines,all I have ever used are Acidophillus Capsules.
What I would like to know though is ,sometimes shortly after I have been to the toilet,I get the sensation of needing to go again ,even though I have just been ,the sensation makes me feel unable to relax.
Sometimes shortly after eating it triggers off an IBS bout or sometimes just a tummy upset with me going back and forward to the toilet.sometimes going on the toilet and sometimes not doing.This makes me not wanting to go out for meals ,in case the same thinghappens when out ,you cannot always get into a toilet even in a restauraunt.So I was just wondering if anyone else has these same symtoms ,and if so how do you deal with eating out IF you do go.
I have been on family occasions but never felt comfortable (just in case ) something I inadvertanly ate triggered things off.
I would appreciate the comments of people experiencing the same as myself

"Hello,
many thanks if you read my other post.
basically in the last few weeks and months I have had a fwe things going on.
From the ""bowels"" point of view, I have lost a little weight which I am monitoring - not really changed over the last month to 6 weeks.
I have changed GP as I was getting nowhere and getting very frustrated.
I introduced a bit more fibre into my diet as my stools were nearly always soft. Not too much diarrhoea but about twice a week or so. I should say that it isn't alot of fibre, just that before I had next to none.
Various bouts os cramps, pain and tenderness to touch. Sometimes things go straight through me.
A few days ago I had a bout of diarrhoea which was floating with a little foamy around the edges. A few hours after I thought I needed to go again but all that came out was some clear mucous with some streaks of red blood on it. Went to the doctor who is running a stool test to check on any bugs or bacteria.
Now this morning (I always need to go first thing), I had a soft BM with the usuals undigested vegetable matter etc (that is normal for me) but there was also a black lump, about the size of a pea. I examined it at it was quite hard but when squeezed it crumbled apart like the ""coffee grounds"" you read about (this was all with tissue and gloves by the way).
Sometimes I have black flecks that look like black pepper but never had it in a lump like this.
I do have a gastro appointment coming in about 2.5 weeks but I am very worried.
any input that anyone can help with is much appreciated. Thank you

I have been suffering now for over half a year and on and off for years. I have an appointment for an gastroenterologist although that appointment is 2!!!! months away!!! so would like help in the mean time.
i do not go to the toilet regularly at all, i am always constipated, when i do go- it is diarrhea. I can't remember the last time i normally went to the toilet. The constipation results in constant bloating, i feel disgusting. 
I don't eat an excess of unhealthy foods, i am not overweight, i eat healthy, drink water, do everything ok except for the fact that i smoke- (i dont know if thats relevant???) 
Occasionally (4 times so far) i wake up with the worst sensation. It starts off feeling like normal indigestion (which i get very often anyway) yet after about 10 minutes it honestly feels like i have swallowed a large brick and its sitting underneath my boobs/in the middle of my stomach, it feels like burning and it is so uncomfortable, the feeling rises up into my throat at times too and i'm often sick because of it although the sick is just bile or really thick substance. 
I suffer from terrible (really really smelly) wind as well and holding it in results in bad pain.

"I have been diagnosed with IBS for about 4 years. At first my sysmptoms were just stomach pain and nausea, then moved to constipation and excessive extremely foul smelling gas. My GP did nothing so i paid to see a private dietician who put me on the low FODMAP diet. this dramaticially reduced the gas but did nothing for the constipation, which i controlled with laxido ( i would only have a bowel movement once a week after taking this). Randomly in august i had diarrhoea which lasted for 2 weeks so i went to the Dr. they did a stool test and said there was nothing wrong and that it was probably IBS, which i found weird as i have never had diarrhoea before.
Since then i have had a few random episodes of diarrhoea, usually just one then i am ok, a few times a month. But i have now been having it again for 2 weeks and it wont stop. I have eaten about 4 meals i the last 2 weeks - i have been either fasting or just eating toast/plain crackers in the hope it will make it stop. i am scared to go out the house. at the moment i am on study leave from work and the commute is an hour by train (with no toilets) so i have been not eating until the evening, and then only toast, just in case. I am tired, my joints ache, i have been snappy with my family, all i want to do is sleep. I tried going to the gym on saturday and ended up shaky and heart racing. I am scared to eat but know i cant go on only eating bread etc (i lost 4 lbs the first week, and probably 2 more since then). I took loperamide last thursday and was ok til today and now i am bad again - it seem all immodium does it 'put a cork in it' for a bit, not turn it back to normal stool which is what i was hoping (it gave me terrible stomach cramp too). I really dont know what to do - i have to go back to work next week and am so nervous. I am a nurse so i cant just go and leave my patients if i have to run off to the loo! I thought of not eating but am scared that being on my feet all day and not eating i will pass out.
Any advice would be really really appreciated.

"So a bit of back story here: I'm 20 years old and generally in good health. 
For the past few months I've been suffering from abdominal pain (mostly under right ribcage) irregular bowel habits, Bloating, etc. Finally got a colonoscopy and endoscopy the other day, colon turned up completely fine, endo came back with slight inflammation and hiatus hernia which I was told not to really worry about. 
Decided to go out on the weekend as a kind of celebration and things got a bit out of hand, ending up in me drinking a ridiculously large amount of alcohol. I then spent the next TWO days throwing up all food /water I was attempting to have and just feeling completely awful. I had bad abdo pains in the same under the rib spot but it seemed to go through to my back as well. Especially when I touched a certain rib in my back it would cause a pain in my back. 
On the second day of the throwing up I decided to go A&E as I was pretty worried I had done some serious damage and Google was shaking me up a bit.  I was given a blood test, not sure what they were even checking for, and urine test which apparently came back fine. 
Day three is today and I do feel quite a bit better: not throwing up anymore but still feeling quite nautius and generally under the weather. I noticed that I'm not really getting much of an urge to urinate which is worrying me, headaches on and off and still a slight pain in the same spots. I have drunk a lot of water today and ate decently throughout the day. 
Am I just being really paranoid here or could I have done some real damage? I would love to hear that this is just a ridiculous hangover due to the amount I drunk and that the tests at A&E would have shown up anything bad? Some reassurance would be so nice as I can't really go back to the doctor just yet. Thanks a lot in advance!

"Hello to all!
I am new to this forum. I was wondering if the pattern of my bowel behavior is symptomatic of IBS. Let me start by saying that I am in peri menopause and started having digestive issues since I've been in peri. Usually I get constipated leading up to my cycle, during and when I go off. But this month I got loose stools. For the days after my cycle ended I was constipated for about four days. Then it went to soft stools then loose stools. Now it has been runny since Tuesday. I'm not so much scared as I am concerned. I don't think it was anything I ate. My kids had some kind of bug but they didn't get the runs. The only thing that I did different is that I stopped my bp meds abruptly. I was taking Norvasc 5mg and Losartan 50 mg. This is all so weird. I have an appointment with my doctor this Saturday. Any thoughts on this?

"Hi, I am a 28 year old male. Two weeks ago I had came down with what I think was a stomach bug. I started vomiting, which lasted for about ten hours, until I was only vomiting what I think was bile (yellow, green stuff, sorry for the details!). I also had an upset stomach. The next day the vomiting had stopped however for last ten days I have felt very weak and fatigued, I have had an upset stomach when I eat and feel sick and dizzy (I haven't vomited since the first night.) On a couple of nights I have had a fever that only starts at around 10pm and goes on into the night, but by the morning is gone. I have also noticed that there is a small area at the top middle section of my abdomen (just below the ribcage) which is tender to touch. It only hurts when I touch it. My stomach is always gurgling and I have lost my appetite. I have booked a gp appointment in a couple of days. Any ideas what it wrong. I am getting quite worried...

My symptoms lately have been severe pain and loose stools.
I can't help but feel it might be something worse than IBS that my Dr is missing.
Tests I did :
FBC
Blood in tool test
Iron
CRP test for inflammation
Cal proctatin test (or however you spell it) a test for inflammation in bowels.
Everything can back clear so Dr says no colonoscopy.
What tests did you guys do?

"I am trying to find out if MRI scans can be used to detect bowel and colon problems, basically things such as ulcers, as I have had no less than four proctograms in my past history and a colonoscopy and a sigmoid, they are uncomfortable, unpleasant and the results were not conclusive even though a 'hands on' under anathetic established I had a fully prolapsed bowel that needed immediate surgery.  So obviously I am disatisfied witht the tests and want to know if there is a more efficient alternative, basically to pick up if I have an ulcer or anything else wrong as my symptoms are so frightful they are really not liveable with.
I have tried googling but all that comes up is things to do with cancer and while I sympathise, that is not the comprehensive answer  I would like, I am asking my doctor tomorrow but she did say ultrasounds can't look at your colon and i am suspicious about that as someone on the forum said they had an ultrasound for bowel related problems so i thought I would throw it open and ask if anyone here has any reliable information on MRI scans, I am assuming that they differ from ultrasounds but i am no expert in this field.

Sharp pains above belly button to the left side & just sharp pains lower belly too.. It all started after my regular dr misdiagnosed me & I got major depression/panic attacks thinking something was wrong with me.. Ever since then my life has changed.. I'm always worrying & now no insurance to get anything done.. But I am looking into getting insurance soon.. I did see a dr before & they thought it was IBS .. I didn't get colonoscopy so now I think that's why I worry more cause I'm not for sure that it is.. My anxiety/stress causes so many other symptoms too.. I can't stop thinking the worst,. These sharp pains are sometimes once or twice a day but not exactly everyday.. It hurts really bad for a second or two and goes away but I do keep getting it.. I feel bloated now but maybe it's because it's almost the time of the month!! Does anyone experience this ?! I hope to soon at least go in for another exam & maybe stool tests & bloodwork

"So, I was diagnosed 12 years ago with IBS while going through some personal stresses, now at 29 years old, I 4 months ago had a bad bacterial infection, I had Ultra sound and blood tests to diagose this, nothing worse happening and before the infection I was fine, not a problem in sight....
Now, since the infection, I have suffered daily with stomach discomfort and infrequent and different bowel movements...mostly constipated and ribbon stools which I know is common with IBS....
The stomach discomfort is mild but annoying and has caused me a great deal of stress and anxiety of thinking 'what if?' now, I have been to the doctors many times, they did more blood tests, checked my symptoms and confirmed that there is nothing serious wrong with me, that IBs and anxiety seems to be causing these discomforts, I want to add the discomfort lasts pretty much morning till night, occasionaly I dont feel it at all, good days bad days....since I also had endoscopy which showed nothing wrong with my stomach....the discomfort being mostly upper central abdoman..
I am working on a Fodmap diet and working on reducing my stress but keep asking myself about the discomforts....yes if it was occasional,I could better accept IBS as the cause as my doctor is with no doubt that I have nothing serious wrong with me...the endoscopy was for my own mind to help me confirm its not stomach cancer....and I am happy to accept it but my symtpoms dont go away and my fears are still there...
Post Infectious IBS seems the most likely cause, as I understand the symptoms can be present everyday, all day for many years until it clears up....??? 
Anyone have any advice here? feel like I need fellow strugglers advice here and some infor about PI-IBS, maybe that others have struggled in the past every day all day for longer than the current 4 months period I have gone through?

My doctors aren't great but after lots of visits I finally got the camera test on my bowel, everything showed in but I had diverticultis. My main symptons are I go through phases of for example waking up at 5am with severe stomach pains always in the very low pelvic area and then I need to rush to the bathroom this then us followed by a series of bowel movements, this can last for a few hours after which I still have the stomach pains, they sometimes feel this contradictions it can be that bad. All day I will be exhausted and just out of sorts! The next few days no vowel movements just extreme bloating and gas. Then this repeats itself again. I also sometimes after I eat food about 20 mins later I must run to the toilet this is usuall diarreah and Aldo sometimes my left side is very sore just before and during a bowel movement it feels like a balloon filling up sbd if doesn't get emptied will explode.

"Dear Sir or Madam,
My name is Ivan. I am writing today to ask you for a favor. I would be grateful if you could answer some questions for me.
My problem is as follows. I have been ill with a serious meteorism for 7 years. It becomes apparent in every situation when it is misplaced. A course of treatment I underwent turned to be effective but only by 90 percent. I live in Russia and was treated here. Diagnosis: irritate large intestine syndrome associated apparently with chronic pancreatitis. Other doctors had made a diagnosis of irritate large intestine syndrome with prevalence of meteorism reasoning from results of the following surveys: abdominal cavity ultrasound, gastroenterostomy with biopsy, analysis of feces for dysbacteriosis. I tried to keep to different diets – they had not helped. The following drugs were effective for me: Eglonil, Kreon, Zakofalk, Hylak forte, etc. The most of drugs had not helped at all. My psychotherapist had managed to create mental comfort between us, but that had not influenced the disease. Russian doctors say I have to undergo treatment regimens from time to time during all my life. They constantly advise me to solve this problem with my psychotherapist, but that is of no use. I did not invent the ploblem, many other people feel the smell from this meteorism. They confirm that repeatedly. I feel just smell, nothing more.
Could doctors invent any device blocking the smell within the intestines? Such a device that could be taken away during toileting. Can something bad happen from that?
Will any methods of cure of this disease be invented in future? Or maybe there are some already existing.
I would appreciate your attention to this matter.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully,
Ivan Sokolov

"3 weeks ago today, I had a nasty 24-hour case of gastroenteritis: vomiting, fever, body aches, the whole nine yards. The fever and vomiting have subsided since then, but I'm still experiencing mild lower abdominal discomfort/tightness (more on the right side, but sometimes the left and middle), alternating between diarrhea and constipation, feeling feverish (but no fever), bloating, and the occasional lack of appetite/feeling full soon after eating. In the past couple days especially at night I've been getting alternating burning/cold sensations in my groin area that sometimes shoot down into my thighs and legs (especially on the right side). Does this sound like IBS to you? I had gastritis but medication has pretty much taken the heartburn out of the equation. I have an abdominal x-ray and ultrasound tomorrow but I'm still nervous (I have anxiety issues and have been freaking myself out lately over the worst case scenarios). Also, my mom has Barrett's esophagitis, her mom had ulcers, and my paternal grandmother has IBS, if genetics have anything to do with it.

"I started having pain in my right side of my abdomen back in November. At first I thought it may be my appendix but the doctor didn't seem to think it was and told me to take pain killers as it may be a strained muscle. The pain continued on and off moving from by my belly button into my right hand side and around to my back. I have had routine bloods twice, tests for urine/bladder infections, two ultrasounds to rule out gall bladder and kidneys and tablets for gastritis that didn't make any difference so was told to stop taking them.
The first ultrasound I paid to go private so asked them to check my ovaries etc as I thought it could be a cyst or worse.
All of these were clear. I have bloods for thyroid and gluten intolorence both clear.
The pain is still there, often when I get up in the morning it's worse, I have pain in my back, increased bowel movements and spells of dizziness.
I am not sure how much of it I am now bringing on myself by thinking about it too much. My family keep telling me to try and forget about it as I have had tests and they have all been clear but it still playing on my mind and I can't get on as normal.
Could it be possible that I have given myself Ibs through stress and worry? I don't know what else to do as I keep going back to the doctors and they don't seem to have any answer.

"I had stomach cramps for a week at the beginning of December. I thought it would just settle down so did not do anything about it. Then I woke up one morning and it was really bad. A GP came to see me and said she thought it might be gallstones. So I went to the hospital and was given various tests. They said I had a urine infection gave me some antibiotics and discharged me. I thought that was the end of that. Then a couple of days later I had a letter asking me to make an appointment for an ultrasound scan. I went the next week and the result showed I had gallstones. Another GP thought it was either gallstones or Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
There is now 6 - 9 month waiting list to have my gallbladder removed and I still have bad stomach cramps and pain in my right side on and off.
I am taking buscopan which are bowel muscle relaxant tablets as and when I need them and i think they really help. I am also on a lo fat diet. Although a GP has said I can go back to eating what I like after I have had my gallbladder removed I now realize that I was eating quite a lot of junk food and would certainly not want to go back to it. This has been a wake up call. LOOK AFTER YOURSELF.

"I have been chronically ill since I was diagnosed with full rectal prolapse or a year before that actually, as the tests I had did not show up the full extent.  I need to open my bowels 16 to 22 times a day, I am full of stinging unpleasant mucus, which is just as irritating as poo and has to be dealt with, I have a constant pain like stubbing my toe although in this case my rectum is involved, and in my honest opinion, I have a gaping wide open wound where my anus used to reside, and I bleed and there are 'awkward bits', I am so sorry if this is unpleasant but I have been laid up in agony, having to take codeine daily as they are the only thing that touch the pain, and am in a permanent state of exhaustion and don't know how for the life of me I stay on my feet at all.  I had a ventral mesh retropescy which is major, in my case keyhole surgery but it simply didn't help hardly at all.  I also strain the living daylights out of myself on the loo every fifteen minutes round the clock for four years now and don't know why I don't give up altogether.  Such is the pain and the ordeal I go through.
On the plus side I have my poetry and photography and art hobbies which I self manage as best I can and use of a mobile and a laptop at which I'm fairly proficient, good friends and family but what do i do?  I suspect an ulcer or even cancer, such is the extremities of what I have been going through especially lately and the medics are quite frankly drawing a blank, I want an ultrasound but keep being told one is not appropriate for bowel conditions, does anyone know if this is right as I have had colonoscopy, sigmoid and FOUR proctograms and cant take the pain and unpleasantness of them and would have thought an ultrasound would be my right by now, after four years of largely inconclusive tests on the more conventional side, please help someone.

"Hey, I was diagnosed with IBS a few months ago and have been suffering for a year. I get stomach attacks where I need to get to the toilet in minutes with diarrhoea. This has made me a nervous wreck. Whenever I am anywhere without a toilet I panic and am anxious the whole time. It's effecting my day to day life and Im now really scared to go out with friends and people are starting to notice I m not going out much. I really don't know what to do I'm on peppermint oil capsules but still get the attacks maybe once a week. But it's the not knowing when it's going to occur that kills me. There is also no link to any foods that I've eaten. It's effecting me a lot mentally and I feel like I have no where to turn. Any help would be great thanks

"So I posted on here before about trying to find the cause of my ibs. I tried VSL probiotic for a number of months with a slight improvement... And have since moved onto a gluten free diet. Anyway... I thought the gluten free had sorted my ibs. If I stay 100% gluten free, don't drink any coffee or cola my symptoms seem to go away... But... I've been noticing some strange things...
1) whenever I eat gluten free foods that seem to contain grease or fat these irritate me. I've had a number of roast dinners which have left me feeling bloated, gluten free sausages also make me feel a bit strange, mince meat bolognase gluten free makes me feel slightly weird aswell. What I mean is I get slight bloating and usually a solid, but slightly burning stool.
2) the other thing I can't work out is that over Xmas I drank a fair amount of beer, eat McDonald's, crisps... Etc and felt fine.
3) I went on holiday last week. The week before I went away I was ill so eat very healthy, no gluten etc and continued this on holiday. I felt really good up until the afternoon of the last day. I had a chicken, bacon and mushroom salad with a side portion of chips. All afternoon I had wind. I woke up the next morning and felt proper rough. My stomach felt awful, had burning poo and felt sick all day. I had to starve myself until tea time before I could eat anything. I had a salad a few days earlier with a side portion of chips with no problems. I eat a lot of fish, veg, fruit etc and have felt fine throughout the rest of the holiday.
What I don't understand is whether I've got this gluten thing wrong or not... Is it something else that's causing my problems? Did I have an ibs attack because of a build up of gluten?... But this doesn't make sense as I've eaten more food containing gluten and not had any real problems? It's frustrating me because im still no clear 100% on what's causing it.
I eat 1/2 a 12"" meat feast pizza a couple of weeks ago to see how is feel the next day... Well it make me feel awful.
There is something in my diet that seems to really badly irritate me and flare up my ibs and I can't work out exactly what it is or why it's happening. Your thoughts would be good.
I'm not coeliac, don't have chrones etc. All my blood, stool and wee tests are normal, my endoscopy was normal.
I'm just wondering if maybe something else is causing my ibs and eating gluten free is relieving the symptoms but not solving the problem.
Thanks

"Hi everyone, for years I've suffered from tummy trouble but never sought medical help. This week I have suffered from a severe pain in my upper middle tummy almost like a tennis ball of pain that feels like a stitch, along with bad wind, lack of appetite, nausea, lower back pain and frequent trips to the toilet with loose foamy stools. Is this ibs? I often suffer from terrible pain in the morning in my lower abdomen and always have a bad tummy reaction to drinking tea. Someone please help I'm worried as I've been googling my symptoms and it's coming up with all sorts including cancer.

"Hello My name is Jenna and i am a 26/f and have been having problems with my colon for almost the past year...I have went to the er for this and also my doctor. When i went to the er it was about 7 months ago for the first time when this all began, and the xray showed that I was backed up bad. So they gave me a few stool softners and some magnesium citrate to clean me out. I thought it was cured.... when i went home to take the magnesium I had trouble with the taste but eventually drank it all. So the next day i went like crazy... all brown water though. Then i took the stool softner and for the next few days pooped the watery feces out... I felt a little better after that and got on with my life. Well about a few days later it all came back even worse.... so i went to my doctor and she said to add more fiber... I was kind of upset that there could not be anything else done.... but i did it anyways... then for the next few months it continued to worsen up and down pain between 1-10 varying. I have been to the er about 7 times and they didnt want to give me another xray to see if im still backed up... I am thinking this whole time i have an impaction..but do you think it would have passed by now? I am also seeing mucs in poo and they are very irregular. pls help.

I was then starting up with the symptoms of belching constipation bad smells wind stomach cramps and all the feelings I got the first time around. I had a second set of triple therapy antibiotics and never really recovered from it.

"Anyone tried Symprove and found they got better or worse? If you haven't heard of it, have a little google, it sounds promising through claiming to be the only probiotic to pass all three tests they did, it supposedly working on around 60% of people according to King's College and reading some of those success stories - only downfall is the price.
Although I'm currently two weeks into it and today seem to notice a general feeling of malaise growing along with getting a bit light-headed, feverish and itchy skin and I know its the probiotic because I'm on the FODMAP diet so haven't been eating anything differently in a long time that could effect me. I found Symprove posted a video on their facebook page about 'die-off' and am hoping it is that but who knows, I was just wondering what other people's experiences were whilst taking Symprove.

"Hi all not sure how this works so will just write!
Had manageable IBS for over 20 years I know my bowels, when they strike and where - always when out ! 
I was pregnant then sadly miscarried just 4 weeks ago all that went very well as in the op etc  but was given Augmentin 4 a day and thats where it all went wrong, the pain, the gas, the cramps, the lower back pain, the cramping after i have tried to eat a small meal, bloated, cant walk to far as the cramps start and I just feel so sad.
Dr has done blood tests full blood count, infection and inflamation (crp) and all normal so all points to a huge flare up of IBS. Had no stool sample taken as no blood no watery diahorea and no inflammation from blood tests.
I am managing crackers and biscuits, new potatos just 1 or 2 , tea and peppermint tea and pro biotic yogurts. Oh and packs of extra strong mints! I seem to have so much wind and indigestion some from ibs and some from the op where they blow you up.
Back to dr on monday as she wants me to start ssri's as so many nerve endings in tummu that can create cramps.
Typically since anti biotics i go once that is ok ish ish then 4 - 5 times again so then the cramps really get angry!!
Only been off the anti biotics for a week and judging by things I have read it can take weeks and weeks to return the tummy to normal if at all.

"Hello all, 
My name is Tim. I was diagnosed with post infectious IBS three and a half years ago, after suffering from a bout of gastroenteritis. I have severe problems with my diet. I cannot tolerate dairy, soya, herbs, spices, fried food, juices, fizzy drinks, alcohol, wheat, any cakes or biscuits (Even if they are lactofree/wheat free), crisps and some other things. Basically, I ate only skinless potatoes with some veg and salad, meat, and some lacto-free products. I also have porridge with maple syrup, and I eat some dark chocolate on occasions. I control my symptoms if I 1) stick to my diet 2) do not talk whilst eating - talking always leads to diarrhea 3) sit for extended periods after eating, from 30mins to over an hour depending on the size of my meal. 
I have spent the last few years working out what I can eat. The frequency of my attacks have certainly decreased, but I feel that my food sensitivity has increased. 
I do not fell tired with my illness unless I have diarrhea, which usually only happens in the mornings occasionally if I keep to my diet (if I ate freely I would have diarrhea multiple times a day). I do not suffer from fevers, I only have pain when I'm going to be ill, and my weight is under control (I'm 5 10 and around the 10 stone mark, which has been consistent for 12 months or so). 
However, I have other symptoms which are consistent with IBD conditions. I have had blood in my stools with more frequency over the last six months, which also appears on the tissue paper after wiping. This does not happen always, and sometimes not for weeks at a time, but it does happen. I also have some arthritis in my back, and I occasionally get eczema.
My father suffers from IBS-D, my mother has bad arthritis, and I also have a cousin with IBS. 2 more distant family members on my mother's side have died from bowel cancer. I had a blood test sometime ago which did not show any unusual inflammation. 
I would really like to know the opinions of some on here, and whether they thought I likely had an IBD condition. I plan to get tests when I can get them, although I dread the inevitable colonoscopy.

"Hello, 
I have read quite a few forums on IBS and it seems there is a lot of people out there suffering, but I somehow missed the forums where people find relief or healing by changing the diet and lifestyle. 
IBS seemed to get me, I got the soft stool, diahrea, crmps bloating, gas, and for several years it got worse and worse.  I started after I realized I was dairy intolerant ( and had a hard time cutting dairy out of my diet).  Then after a few years of extreme athletics lifestyle and the need to lean out, I gradualy cut out rice pasta bread, most grains.  I was eating a lot of meat, eggs, veggies, but by no means was I eating healthy enough.  
After I got tired of the symptoms I got serious about my diet, sleep and activity level, stress, and a balanced lifestyle. I introduced raw fermented foods, lots of greens, vitamins, cut out most dairy, ate more fish, took probiotics, lots of cabbage, and crusiferous veggies that do give me gas, but I still ate them. I juiced, I cut out bad fats, brought in good fats, ate more salads and fresh food from farmers markets that ripened on the vine, not food from huge grocergy store chains. Fresh eggs from the neighbors chickens. Grew my own herbs, salad, and tomatoes. 
I can say that as of a few months ago, I am really better, I have no more extremem bloating, constant diahrea, I can eat bread, pasta and some dairy now.  While I cant pinpoint any one thing in this journey, it took about 2 years of serious changes and all of a sudden my gut is working great!
I would like to hear more stories like this or hear about how all of you suffering are changing your diet and if you are having any success. For me, success did not seem to happen, I could not tell if I was any better for a long time, but all of a sudden, finaly, I was. 
By the way, my wieght gain has stopped and I don't have to really watch at such an extreme level what I eat to mainain weight.  I also no longer am involved in extreme athletic endevors but a normal gentle lifestyle now.

"My situation really shows up how slow and at times non existent treatment for things like prolapsed bowel, rectal ulcers and plain old IBS really are, myself I was stunned, as I was with how schizophrenics are actively discriminated against when it comes to getting treatment for physical complaints, and like me, told repeatedly that symptoms of rectal ulcer subsequent to prolapse were 'behavioural', I mean it became and still is, worse than a sick (no pun intended!) joke.  I waited a year and had a colonoscopy and a proctogram which (apparently) didn't show up the prolapse, for a hands on under anathetic examination, which showed it to be full, so I had waited a year, by then for an operation, which by then was an emergency, and when I was told my continuing symptoms were behavioural by then I thought they are just covering their tracks, covering things up in other words, and three years after that, and of taking in precise and concise notes about the dreadful extent of my symptoms they are still doing nothing about it and I am in floods of tears fully expecting that under the circumstances I WONT be granted an ultrasound, after more conventional methods showing up nothing.  It just makes me want to dispair, as I am literally swimming in mucus and bleeding, and in a great deal of pain, feel like screaming at these medics but desparately trying at the same time to remain calm.

"Hi all.
I'm a new member and thought I'd share my ibs story.
I went through my whole life with no bowel problems ..In 2004 I fell pregnant with my 3rd child and first daughter.
On her due date she passed away for no known reason.
Since then my health has detireiated with various problems ..
In 2005 I fell pregnant again. One day on the loo the pain was immense I thought I was having a miscarriage.
I called an ambulance out . Whilst the paramedic was talking to me on the loo my bowels let go...slightly embarrassing. .The loo filled with diarrhoea and my pain stopped.
The paramedics said there u go just constipation and left.
Then in 2007 I fell pregnant again. This time I was in the cinema with my husband watching a film . The pain struck and I ran to the loo. Scared I was losing the baby I text my husband who came with me into the girls loo and held my hand.
I sweated n panted and breathed like labour until my bowels dropped the diarrhea and I was free from the pain.
I went to the gp who said it was in my head because of my stillbirth. That I was rightfully so anxious. 
So after the birth of my then 5th child I was shocked when it happened again.
The gp kept saying it was due to my stillbirth stress and worry.
In 2009 I woke one day...and fell down my stairs. It hurt like mad but after checking myself over I knew I was ok so I carried on with my day.
Next day I woke at 5 am.  In the simular agony.
I ran to the loo breathed it out as normal. Only this time the loo filled with blood and big lumps of tissue.
I sobbed and waited til my husband woke who rang my mum and drove me to hospital. I was bleeding very bad. I was in hospital for 2 weeks!! During that time they put a camera up my bum...They found my bowels had collapsed. They show me the photo..It was like a tube that suddenly shut. They said they think I had chrones.  
They planned on removing that part of my bowel in surgery.
When the day of surgery came they did they test again.  It was a mirical they said as it was fixed. No collapse. 
So they baffled..just sent me home. I was confused but he said he was a surgeon I needed to see my gp.
So I went home.
I kept on every now and again getting these bouts..but the gp said do you have constipation or diarrhea.  I said we'll both. ..It hurts n hurts n hurts all blocked up until it come out as diarrhea. 
But he couldn't get his head round it.
In 2011 I changed my gp. I saw her and told her of my problems. She said we'll sounds like ibs.
Ever since I've been on buscipan can't be without it . If I eat white bread or pasta I really suffer.
I don't get the bouts ad often anymore as my diet helps and better sleep. It always trigger off my panic attacks so I have to stay in self control.
That's my story

"I have been suffering from abdominal pain and going to the toilet on waking up, soft stools since last year.  Dr said I have got IBS after one visist, and I was prescribed Pepper mint tablet which did not help.  I found taking probiotics yohurt such as activa and optibac tablets have helped a lot.
I know there is something wrong with me but not sure what it is as I do not suffer from conspitaion or diarrhoea.  Usually on waking up I do go the toilet but sometimes after I have eaten I need to do to the toilet again, stools sometimes normal sometimes loose.  When I need to travel long distance I get vey anxios I usually take an imodium and I feel more relaxed.  Lately after I have eaten two hours later I get terrible abdominal craps, and nausea and have loose stools but this happens approx once a week and I have kept a food diary and it is not related to food I have eaten.  I have stuffed myself over xmas with chocolates to the point of making myself sick but my tummy was fine, no discomfort or loose stools.  I do not have the classic IBS symptoms diarrhoe or constipation but I know there is something wrong.  I am very anxious to travel long distance since I do not know when it will happen and if I need to go to the toilet, it is a full blown bowel motion. I do not want to take daily medication for something that happens once a week or sometimes I could go weeks without any problem.  I have had bloods tests to rule out anything serious.  Is there anything else I can do?  I had my gall bladder removed and at the beginning they are exactly the same symptoms I was expereriencing prior to the op.  Thanks for listening.

"Hi guys, me again
So, this morning, had my latest visit to the doctor...she examined my stomach, checked my blood results and my symptoms and blood pressure....told me that she is certain I have nothing serious wrong with me, no serious illness or cancer....endoscopy will help me understand and accept that it is IBS, also, a touch of Gastronitis which is common with IBS sufferers....and we can take the best course of action in terms of medication. Now, yes the doctor all but ruling out anything serious, it does make my symptoms which is very surely now IBS confirmed less scary (still not nice) but I can be positive, or work on being positive that I am safe and what is happening is not killing me....but having an Endoscopy is scary on its own and is causing me some anxiety. The doctor gave me Xanax to help reduce those intense anxieties....so I have 6 days before I can have my edoscopy and results which I am 97% sure will come back to show nothing but some Gastronitis....any of you guys had Endoscopy before? Maybe some advice of how to handle it? I am scared of my Gag reflex and I dont want sedation....any tips of how to prepare are most welcome....
And I know the doctor expects to find nothing in my stomach....I am still scared of the 'what if'' anxious thought...something I will have to work on over the next 6 days...any advice would be good about this also..

"So I was diagnosed roughly a month ago with post infectious IBS. Was getting bad pains mainly tucked under my right rib, Bloating, loose stools. 
Now, yesterday-36 hours or so ago I started noticing a kind of burning, tingling pain a bit lower down next to my hip (where I assume my appendix to be). I'm almost certain I've had this pain before in the same position over the month but it's a very different pain to the 'stitch' like pain I originally had under my rib. It's very tender to the touch and kind of hurts/burns when I touch it, but it's quite a nails pain. It sometimes randomly  throbs from time to time. 
Worried of the worst and being a bad anxiety sufferer I immediately went to A&E and the doctor took my temperature, blood pressure which was normal.
He touched over my abdomen/appendix area and used a stethoscope to listen to it and he said all that was fine. 
He said my appendix seemed fine but this pain is really worrying me now. 
I would love to hear anyone else's opinion on this. Am I just being silly here and this is just my IBS? 
Thanks in advance.

"Hi Everyone hope you all had a good Christmas.
Can anyone tell how antibiotics have affected your IBS.  It is well known that the two don't mix.  I am on a 7 day course of Amoxicillin 500 for a urinary infection (had to go to local hospital on Christmas Eve). Before the urinary infection I had been battling an awful cold with terrible cough (not helped by having asthma).  This caused my system to slow down and I became constipated in desperation I took sennokot but was on the toilet around 6 or 7 times the day afterwards.  Still not back to normal but better.  Do you think it was the sennekot or the amoxicillin.  I have family coming tomorrow for New Year so want to be as well as possible.  Thanks.

"Hello there
I have never posted here before but been on the site and read posts over the years.  I realise what I am about to list will have been seen a million times before, but I need to write it for my own clarity.  I'll try to keep it short...but I would be SO grateful for any advice!
I am now 36 but in my late 20's after a bout of general unwellness (all digestive related e.g. frequency to the loo, often loose, spells that I termed ""poison attacks with intense acid reflux and spreading pain in the upper stomach area etc) my GP diagnosed IBS.  He did a number of blood tests but that was all as said I didn't require invasive testing given my age and blood results.  It was managed over a period with things like buscopan, lanzoprazole, movicol etc etc.  At the time I had a stressful and unhappy job, had just planned my wedding, was renovating a house and we were trying (without success for a baby).  It went on in a moderate state for a couple of years then I got made redundant and fairly quickly after fell pregnant after 2 and half years trying and suddenly my health just improved and all was forgotten (this was 2011).  Preoccupied with my young baby and not working I felt good for a year or so after having him, then in early 2014 it all started again - just fairly mildly again, as in infrequent bouts but the ""poison attacks"" started lasting longer, 3 /4 days rather than 24 hours or so. We were moving house and renovating our new one plus other tiring and stressful stuff going on in my life, with poor sleep thanks to a flighty toddler and so 2014 has progressed and all the while the symptoms of 7+ years ago are back and THEN SOME!! Just coming on gradually but more each time to the point where in September just gone it came on and has never really gone.  Since then I have been back to my GP 4 times, tomorrow makes 5.  I am booked in for a liver / gallbladder scan in January.  She has done some bloods (sugar, thyroids, blood count, inflammation calcium, liver function maybe more) and all came back fine.  I returned to work part time in July (but not a stressed role) and co-incidentally we have been trying for baby #2 for the last year and no success again.  In a nutshell my symptoms are as follows (and many of them I've had for years and years to varying degrees):
+upper stomach bloating and discomfort ranging into ""poison attacks"" where I get intense acid reflux / uncomfortable pain spreading under my ribs
+ noisy stomach - gurgling and grumbling like mad
+flatulence
+lower stomach problems - diahorrea (or looseness), and more recently alternate bouts of constipation, always had frequency passes but recently getting the urge to bear down and go even if nothing passes which in turn is causing rear end itching and irritation and occasional bleeding from the anus (not in stools so far as I can tell), and now recently a sensation of pressure like a broom handle is up my backend!
+ very heavy fatigue and headaches during my ""poison attacks""
+ in last 3 / 4 months had constant lower backache
+ split second tiny shooting stabbing pains around rectal / gynae area
+ tender front stomach - pulling sensations in my groin areas (had this for years) and just a general mild queasiness (like I could be pregnant but am definitely not)
+no weight loss, infact if anything weight gain despite trying to cut down
I am an active woman, we enjoy long regular walks with the dog, I work, look after my son, keep the house etc, so am always on the go.  Despite this I am overweight and have been for several years.  I don't even know my weight but would guess I am at least 2 stone over (my dress size is 16-18). I had 2 bouts of H. pylori in my mid-20s before IBS diagnosis, been tested again for that now but came back clear.
Other random symptoms I have had for many years include high colouration in my face, my hands and feet frequently swell up and go down and I sometimes get spells of a random rash (like hives) on my arms and legs for no obvious reason.
Much of all this I have just put up with for years, but the frequency of discomfort and the changes in my bowel habits recently have got me unnnerved and fearing the worst.  I am seeing the GP tomorrow and want to insist on some bowel investigations and will go privately if needs be.  I know from past experience that anxiety only exacerbates things so I am trying (and failing!) my best to keep the sensible head....no really I am totally panicking!
Any advice, or people experiencing the same or similar I would love to hear from!!
(oh yes, and today for the first time ever I passed the oddest long fibrous strands, like corn cob silks, which freaked me out!! Only relavent thing I've eaten is green beans and they have never done that before.  Though I do always struggle to digest salad leaves).
Sorry for the long post despite my initial promise - I appreciate anyone's help who made it to the end. Thanks

"Hi, I've recently been diagnosed with IBS after returning to University for my second year. I have had had issues with my stomach all my life - generally when I was on my period - but after returning to University I felt incapable of even walking to the toilet let alone paying attention in lectures - I put this down to stress but now I am getting it regularly and I would say that my stress levels have been fairly low recently.
My symptoms vary, unfortunately, and during that week at Uni it involved: lethargy, vomiting, nausea, constipation, bloating and flatulence. But recently, after being diagnosed and under-taking several blood tests and being  prescribed Mebeverine (which my GP has since changed to Alverine to see if it works any better), my symptoms have changed. A few weeks ago I vomited and had severe diarhea (excuse the spelling) twice in two weeks and then this week - typically during Christmas - I have had severe constipation and have been having 'wet farts' where I have an urgent need to go to the toilet but all I have passed is mucus (which I have never had before) and farted. I'm concerned about the constipation as normally when I have been constipated but I've continued eating since I have a diet regime as prescribed by the doctor, it has resulted in diarhea and vomiting in some cases. I'm going to try some natural remedies but I just want to see if anyone else is experiencing this kind of fluctuation of symptoms and what they thought of the other drugs as I though the mebeverine was helping - although it was a bother to take as I had to have 20 minutes before a meal which I found difficult because I only eat when I am hungry - I can't eat when I'm not as this causes bloating and nausea - but I haven't seen much change in the Alverine besides these changes in symptoms...I'm a little confused.
Just as an added info: when I had my blood tests done I was found to have a raised liver-function - bilirubin - and I am borderline aneamic. My sister has recently had trouble with her stomach too and has a raised ALT liver enzyme. I don't know if this matters but it is strange that it has flared up at the same time as my illness too.
Please help and let me know if this is normal or if I should return to my doctor and press them for my help.

"I have had several bought of IBS and began to get the feelings of another attack. I have only had this for about 10 months so I strted to think what had changed. I then began to look at my antihistamines that I have been taking for around 18 months. The leaflet said side affects can be constipation diarrhoea along with a lot of the other symptoms I was suffering. So I stopped taking them. Within 24 hours I felt better and have not had an attack since. It's still early and I may have another attack in which case I will know O was off the mark but I thought I would share just in case anyone else wants to try dropping their antihistamines if they take them for alergies.

"Hi everyone - I spotted this discussion forum and thought I'd contribute.
I suffered from severe IBS throughout my 20's. It started while I was on holiday, in Ireland, and the doctor initially thought it was appendicitis. When I got home, I was in agony. I was 23 at the time. I was finally diagnosed with IBS about 6 months later, after chronic bowel pain. It slowly got worse. When I was 26 my hospital consultant thought it might be Chrones disease. It wasn't. When I was 28, I saw a different consultant - and he suggested I try 'alternative' medications (non-prescription, from health food shops). I was unemployed at the time, and having to spend £30 each month on 5 different types of pills was a problem! But I did, and within a couple of months the pain was being effectively managed! Such relief.
But, as I hadn't the money to buy these drugs, I decided to experiment. I systematically omitted a pill, and waited to see if the pain relief continued. Finally, I got it down to just 2 pills: hydrochloric acid and pepsin. So I continued taking these.
Then, when I was away staying with family, I ran out of medication ... a waited for the pain to hit me, but it didn't. A week went by. Then a month. Now a decade has passed, and I've never suffered from IBS in all that time.
It took about 1 year of taking hydrochloric acid and pepsin, each and every day two or three times daily, but my body adjusted itself. I suffered from IBS for about 7 years. The pain was severe - making me frequently bed-ridden. But these pills worked, and I'm thankful.
I'm not suggesting that this will work for others. But it might. If you haven't tried such pills, you might consider doing so.

"Hi everyone... First time posting. I am 34 (today) and think I am suffering with IBS. I have always had reasonably regular diarrhea (before and after menstrual cycle) and I thought it was just hormonal... But shortly after the birth of my daughter 3 1/2 years ago I developed gall stones. The following February I had laparoscopic cholecystectomy and that's when my problems really started... Couple of weeks later everything I ate seemed to make me need to go within around 10-20 minutes of eating. Spoke to go and they said it was probably to do with my body getting used to the new constant flow of bile and should settle soon. However, it didn't. It is no longer everything I eat, but anything I eat. It might be a salad, it could be a burger or curry, could be a mince pie, glass of water or skipping breakfast... Every single day I have loose stools, sometimes with pain and urgency, others without. On a number of occasions I have had the first grumble and realised a I was 5 minutes from the nearest loo, only to not make it resulting in accidents. 
After having my my daughter I chose not to return to work, opting instead to return to education. I did an access course and then began university to study a degree in midwifery. I have been very lucky to have some very good friends who understand the need to turn up the to and avoid the bathroom for a while after I have dashed out, but in public places it is a nightmare... Dirty looks for going to the disabled loo after an accident or knowing it's going to be a clean up job. 
As as many of you will know, with these daily bouts come fatigue, dizziness, inability to concentrate and although I am waiting for endoscopy at the end of January the condition has take its toll on my studies and I have been forced to withdraw... Fainting as a woman is in the latter stages of pushing a baby out is never a good career move, nor is dashing out of theatre... Just completely embarrassing and unprofessional!
it has put us under immense financial strain, given that the very idea of interviewing for a job sends my bowel into spasm, and I struggle to get through a 40 minute PTA meeting at school (thought I should try to do something to get myself back out there)... However, first PTA meeting resulted in me ducking out!
this whole thing has me so down and miserable. I am constantly I'll and have dropped us right in it financially before Christmas... My partner is very understanding, but I feel such guilt and feel like I have wasted the last 2 1/2 years of my life when clearly this illness is incompatible with my chosen career!
sorry everyone, I just needed to offload xxx

"I wonder if someone might be able to help. I have had been diagnosed with IBS and manage my symptoms fairly well with the occassional flare up. I am 60 which is fairly young by todays stardards but
1) Do your IBS symptoms get worse as you get older or stay the same.
2) Does the list of foods you can tolerate get longer as you get older.
3) Have you discoverd a pain killer which works for you on your IBS symptoms.
You can see what I am after can't you? I am looking for an insite into the future. Someone out there will have the answers.

"Hello everyone- I have been diagnosed with IBs after having a bowel MRI, blood tests stool sakes etc they said they didn't think I needed a colonoscopy due to good bloods and scans. 
I was wondering whether anyone else has experienced 'attacks' at night. I have ready on quite a few websites that ibs doesn't occur at night but mine certainly does! If I've eaten a lot that day or 'bad' food I will wake up around an hour after falling asleep with the worst cramps ever, I'll have mega wind and I'll have to run to the toilet and have a loose stool (sorry) I'll then start shaking uncontrollably and feel sick- I have my antispasmodic and fall asleep and by morning I'm ok just feel a bit sore muscles.
i still have the usual ibs bloating, wind, cramps etc during the day but I've never seen anyone have the same night time occurrences as me. Also the last few days I've experienced a stitch like pain on my right lower side between my hip and rib- I wasn't sure if it was hunger pain or something else but it's really sharp.
any info or advice would be fab- thankyou!

"I am beginning to feel I am addicted to stress and the symptom is IBS. I have noticed a sort of war going on in my head where I need to keep myself in stressful situations. I don't really mind what the situation is but I am sure that I am getting worse. This morning I got up at 3.00 am to make my wife a chocolate cake, it took me until 5.30 am and then I checked my blood sugar and had some porridge and milled linseed for breakfast. Obviously the IBS played up and gave me cramping in my left side, but I could not stop myself until I had done the chocolate topping at 6.30 am.
There was no need to do this, my wife was surprised when she came down at 8.00 am knowing that it was all for her because I am diabetic. I need the stress of doing this.
Another moring I decided to do some maths tests on the internet at 2.00am. I don't understand what is wrong with me, I need the stress and have explained all this to my GP. He prescribed me some diazepam 2 mg but I don't like taking them because they take my motivation away and I miss it within 2 hours of taking them. I know I am hooked on stress and cannot get off it. I am fairly sure this is the cause of my IBS. The whole thing is generated by my state of my. Has anyone out there discoverd they are like me?
If you became addicted to a drug you can get off it by abstaining from the substance. Escaping from a state of mind that gives you a buzz is much more difficult, even though it is giving you IBS.
My memory recall seems to be increasing and my need for sleep is seriously reduced. What would you say I should do.

"I have had some bowel problems for a while such as pains in my stomach, constipation, feeling sick, a sense of fullness that never goes away and on and off spasm's in certain places. I had a colonoscopy which came back 100% normal ( I am 18 btw ) My doctor didn't even bring up IBS, the situation was kind of just left to the way side since I have extreme health anxiety.
I do obsess about my health ALOT  so I know I do have a anxiety problem. But lately I have been feeling alot more fulness and pain which is located behind my left rib cage and a little down my stomach, but not much. The pain is always in the exact same spot which feels right behind my rib cage on the left side although I do sometimes get it in other places in my stomach.
I have had a little bit of a couch lately and when I breath in very deeply and let out my breath I can feel something move exactly where the pain behind my ribs are which is scaring me the most. The doctor fely my nodes and everything ( Because my under arms and neck were hurting ) and everything felt fine.
I am not couching up blood, my couch goes on and off and feels more throaty then in my lungs, I do get on and off wheezing in my right lung.
I have been given multiple medications to counter the stomach fulness but it has not helped at all. Does this sound like IBS + Severe anxiety or something sinister ?
Ogh, and I had an abdominal ultrasound and xray about 10 months ago because some liver enzymes were wonky but they have improved dramatically in the last month. (The ultrasound was completely normal, the xray showed slight curvature in my spine)
Thankyou,
James

"i have been diagnosed with ibs now although this has been going on for a long time, my doctors advised me to cut out all gluten and wheat (i already had an intorellence to dairy). I am 23 and a third year and university which is stressful enough and in the space of three months i have lost the life that i loved, i am no longer able to go out with my friends to dinner spontaniously. i have to think about everything that i eat and this is not the way that i wanted my life to turn out. i am never going to be normal and fit in. This has already become clear with my family as i am now a complete outsider, even something as simple as a roast dinner i cant have. there is nobody around me that understands how this feels, my whole life feels like it is crumbling around me. I dont want to live with this. Depression has been a massive part of it all, i cannot stop crying and i have no motivation to do anything but then as soon as its time to go to sleep i cant and takes me hours just to get to sleep.

"About three weeks ago I started with dizziness and heartburn which was very slight, then came the abdominal pain which lasted a couple of seconds. This then went into a dull ache, immediately I was worried it was my appendix and saw my GP who ruled it was a virus even though had some tenderness (locum that I saw). This carried on with all the above symptons which indeed started to go into my back, going to the toilet was a period of constipation and feeling that I still needed to go afterwards. At times I felt like I was straining because I was willing for this horrible feeling and pain to go away....I know not helping.
I have been worrying myself stupid because I suffer health anxiety as well so not god at all. I went back to see my own GP this week and she has definitely ruled my appendix out, and she has confirmed that she thinks it's my bowels and given me Mebeverine but I have health anxiety and worry about taking tablets and side effects....I know I am not helping myself.
My GP has arranged for me to go for a scan to make sure it's not a cyst on my ovary, can anyone give me there experiences and have they suffered anything like this? I know everyone's different but sometimes reassurance is all we need. Also has anyone took primo tic drinks and did they help? Thanks

"I'm a 21 year old woman, and I was diagnosed with ibs early this year after having intense stomach cramps when I exercised, and frequent diarrhoea. It got worse when I was on my period but no other trigger was found, and it seemed to be random or maybe anxiety related. Usually it started after I ate but there was no pattern with the type of food that I noticed. I went on the DEPO injection to stop my periods which lessened the symptoms for the most part up until around October, when it flared up again. Before, the pain felt more like I was just extremely bloated, but then it started to feel like period pains, with all other symptoms the same as before
I've had recent blood tests with the only abnormality being raised bilirubin, and swabs that came back normal two months ago (after originally mentioning it felt like period pains). A couple of weeks ago, the pain started to be more apparent at a point in my lower left side, in between my last rib and hip bone. Since then I've also had pain during sex. I mentioned both during a doctor's appointment on Monday and the doctor felt my stomach, determined that the pain didn't increase when I moved/pressed the area and prescribed me Buscopan tablets for the cramps (saying it would help the pain during sex, too). Since starting them on Tuesday (at the lower dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day) the pain has ""moved"" so it seems to all be coming from the point in my left side. It hurts no matter what my bowel movements are like, or what I've eaten, and it feels worse than usual, but I'm not sure if this is because it's more noticeable than when it was across my whole stomach

"Hi there
im new here.
im currently- my dr and I - trying to figure out whatis going on with my bowels.
Short of a colonoscopy these are what they could be.
ive had bad bowels for 3 months - constipated, diaherroa, constipated again and now undigested loose stools that to pop -  re : burning!!!
i did have blastocystis found in one stool sample but not others.
Reading about it makes me think it's that which sucks as it's almost impossible to get rid of!
does anyone here think this sounds familiar to IBS?
i use to get intense pain before a bowel movement but now only mild but with burning-almost like id eaten a curry(sad to say I haven't)
I'm really at the end of my rope- I'm 38- no history of colon cancer and all blood tests (I did them all twice) came back clear - in fact better second time round - but I'd love a normal poop!!!!!!!!
any help would mean more to me than you realise......

"I would like to point out something I have discovered after someone suggested licorice as a health giving substance.
I was quick to point out that I could not tolerate this food, actually makes me feel strange and I thought it made my blood sugar rise but I was wrong it makes my blood sugar fall very rapidly, I did the experiment this afternoon. I fell from a blood sugar of 7 to 3 in two hours. This in diabetic terms is called a hypo and can be very dangerous. I have IBS and type 2 diabetes treated with metformin (6 tablets per day) after a little research on the internet I discovered there was a known reaction between licorice and metformin causing blood sugar to fall. If I just had IBS I would properly get away with it. The point of this is to suggest that anyone trying a seemingly inocent new herb or spice needs to check if there is any known reaction with there existing medication.
It is suggested that people with heart, liver, diabetes, or hormone-sensitive diseases should not take licorice.
You comments will be appreciated.

Well I had the most horrendous violent runs all night 
Since then I have gone from been ok to massive 6 times attacks of violent runs. I feel I can't eat and am getting really anxious. I had an attack for 3 hours this morning finishing with uncontrollable runs
I have always had ibs but not like this. It's the violent watery runs that is frightening and awful pain before.

"I have suffered from IBS for over two years and have come to the conclusion that it is generated because I cannot properly cope with stress.
There seems to be a connection berween emotions and my gastrointestional tract. I seem to get IBS flare ups when I am worried about something or I spend too much time thinking about a problem I am unable to solve. This condition also affects my sleep which makes my IBS even worse.
I have had a Colonoscopy, four X rays and a CT scan. The hospital consultant could find nothing physically wrong. My GP said it was IBS.
I am trying to improve myself by relaxing more and putting problems out of my head. It does seem to have an effect.
If you have been diagnosed with IBS I would like to here your comments.

"Hi, I'm new and just starting my IBS journey. I am a49 years old  woman with 4 children. I have had 3 episodes so far and have noticed a pattern. A week to 10 days before an attack I am woken in the night by heartburn and trapped wind. I feel nauseas during the day and have heart burn when I eat. I then have a day where I am on the toilet for 45 minutes to an hour. I can only describe the pain as similar to childbirth. I have wave after wave of pain accompanied by, not really diarrhoea but poop that is the consistency of peanut butter (smooth variety) vomiting, sweating and I go into shock. The rest of the time I am mostly constipated even though I eat a lot of fruit and veg. I don't seem to have a food that brings it on.
My question is, at what stage do I take the Buscopan? I don't have any warning that my ""toilet day"" is coming until it happens. I get abdominal pain and have to get to a toilet. I am having my ""build up"" symptoms right now. I was awoken by heartburn and trapped wind in the night and now have nauseas and heartburn, this could go on for a week or more before the attack. So when do I take the Buscopan? If I wait until I have the cramps it's too late. Any help would be great.

"Hi,
I've decided to trial a few things on a 'longer' term basis for try and help with my Ibs.
I am on day 31 of VSL 3 probiotic. 1 sachet a day (on a morning) mixed into an activia yoghurt.
So... Up until 3 days ago I hadn't really noticed any improvement. I've not changed my diet in any way and eating at usual times and usual quantities of food. 3 days ago (and as I write this) my ibs seems to have calmed down. I've been passing solid stools and for the first time in years I'm actually passing a stool and not having to rush back to the toilet for a second attempt lol. I have also passed a few stools recently and the 'not finished' feeling has gone. 
Not saying that this VSL is curing me or whatever as there have been times previously I've had no symptoms of ibs for a short period of time usually before an ibs attack.
Just thought ppl maybe interested. I will keep this post updated. Plan to stay on the VSL for a few months before I can judge 100% whether it helps my symptoms or not.

"So it all started roughly 4 weeks ago where suddenly one day I was getting really bad stomach cramps, bloating, a lot of gas especially after eating (my stomach would literally rumble all the time, eating or not eating), had very little appetite. Went to the doctors a few days later and they said I had a stomach infection, I wasn't having diarrhea or vomiting at the time.
I started to worry a lot during the next week or so as I suffer from pretty bad anxiety and the symptoms weren't changing at all. I lost about a stone of weight in a week and a half which I assume was down to not eating  (I could only manage a few bananas a day) 
About a week later my stomach cramps seemed to stop and a pain developed just under my right set of ribs, which seemed to get worse and worse as the days went by. I started to get really loose BMs of a weird greeny dark orange colour which seemed to reduce the pain and would find myself going 3+ times a day and not feel empty after the first. I find myself needing to urinate a lot more frequently too, maybe cause I'm drinking a load of water? 
In my stools are these weird black dry bits of varying length (they were purple today but I'm not sure if that was kidney beans I ate last night) They are dry and kinda look like the bits of popcorn shell that come off the corns before you put them in the microwave,  but not as hard if that makes sense? 
I went to the doctors a few more times and got shrugged off saying it was all down to my anxiety which was causing the issues?
Finally I got to see a good doctor who gave me a blood test which came back with nothing and said I had IBS which was developed as a post-infection mixed with my anxiety levels. I kept asking if any other tests were required and he kept saying there is no point. 
Now I usually have a constant pain under my right ribcage, which comes and goes through the day, usually worse after eating, sometimes under my left ribcage is a feint pain too and sometimes it'll rise into upper abdomen.

I am having the same sort of issues with my intestines, i get lower stomach pains and gurgling noises that cause pain, i can pretty much feel it making its way around my guts, i get back pain but mid and lower before finally passing the gas then a few minutes later the symptoms reappear. this is on and off all day. when it is on its really rather painful ive tried ignoring it, i have to wait another 3/4 weeks to get old meds out of my system before i can have a stool sample tested i have had blood tests and all come back fine

"These are some ideas I have come up with and I would like to here what you think.
I think a bowel is an intelligent organ. It seems to behave as if it is part of our brain.
Normally it sets up a rythmic action to pass waste from the small intestine but it can also increase the force of contractions if required. If it needs more assistance it sends a signal to the brain for more water and we are made to feel thirsty.
However, as with all complex intelligent devices the bowel programming can go wrong. It can become over sensitived and can over react to a situation. As with a hysterical child it needs to be calmed down gently and when better, needs re-educating on how to cope with a particular situation in the future.
To re-educate your bowel you must treat it with care and consideration for a long period of time so it has a chance to forget learnt bad behaviour of the past.
Your bowel has full communication with your brain.
1) It experiences shock and pain if you have a bad experience.
2) It can sense acidic or spicy food long before it has to actually deal with it.
3) It reacts aggressively, if given too much fat or oil to deal with, causing it to contract violently.
4) Some chemicals irritate the lining of the bowel causing the rythmic contractions to go out of sequence.
(antibiotics can cause problems by actually changing the bowel live chemistry.)
5) Even if you get depressed about something your bowel can become disfunctional and respond to negative signals from the brain.
6) The worst thing for us is the bowel has a memory.
It is for these reasons that medical examinations show there is nothing physically wrong with us when you have IBS.
To get better we need to change our habits, break the psychological cycle and de-stress ourselves.
Take life at an easier pace. Chill out and spend more time caring for ourselves. Eat little and often. Don't eat food which is to acid or contains too much spice. Alcohol is also bad news for your bowel.
Could you take it easy or are you a stress monster like me? If you completely de-stressed your life could you cope with the change.
Please give me you thoughts, you can say what you like as I will learn from it.
Best wishes
Robert

"Hello,
I am posting in here because first off I believed I had symptoms of Ibs that started 4 months ago. I did not go to my doctor for this due to school and the fact that when I had a cough that pretty much lasted me 3 months, it took her two months to order a chest x-ray to rule out anything sinister. So, due to the stress of school and feeling like she dismissed me I didn't go back to her when she told me to wait a month if my constipation persists. Since that time I experienced periods of frequent urination where I end up peeing every hour or two; the pee is a pale yellow. Other things I have experienced is mucous in stool, stool being really soft that it breaks up a lot in toilet bowl, bouts of constipation and diahrrea ( I think I experience diahrrea even though it is not the standard liquid poo, it's just that I end up pooing 3-4 times a day and my stool is really soft),  a what I think is a chronic anal fissure, liquid that comes from my anus sometimes (not in huge quantities). This week I experienced a sudden onset of lower back pain that started in my left side (very acute) and when I woke up I had neck and right back pain that is also on the lower part. I am also experiencing frequent urination that does not wake me up during the night. Another thing the symtoms mentioned above seemed to have eased a little bit in the beginnings of November but returned when I got a cold/flu and my period. I also still have the cold/flu and it has been two weeks now. I am trying to see my doctor by tomorrow or the next day. I am pretty scared that these are not symptoms of Ibs and that I have something way worse and life threatening

"Hi all,
I'm a 20 year old female, previously fit and healthy with a healthy BMI.
In Novemeber last year I had excrutiating abdo pain and was admitted for an emergency laparoscopy to remove what they thought was an ovarian cyst. Drs found nothing and I was told to go back to my GP who reffered me to the Gastrointestinal dept at my local hospital.
I was told I have IBS and put on mebervine and tried the FODMAP diet for 8 weeks, neither of which helped my symptons at all. I suffer from constipation and sever abdo pain. I had an ultrasound, blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopy, all of which came back normal so it has ruled out any chances of chrons disease. I was then put on Amitryptaline and a wheat free diet, again neither of which made any difference. I have been taking 2 senna a night and also 3 sachets of movicol a day, which has helped with my constipation but not to a very good extent, and I'm still in agony every day. I've now been precribed Prucalopride (a very strong laxative) but I'm so stressed that this won't work. I'm a student nurse and I really don't beleive this is IBS. There is no particular food that irritates me, the only sympton of mine that links to IBS is constipation and that only came on 5 months after the first pains started.
My consultant told me yesterday that there is nothing else he can do for me, he has discharged me from his care and when I asked what should I do now, he said ""stop over thinking things, you worry too much. Go and have a good night out and enjoy your life you are only 20"". I was really upset by this because how can I when I'm in so much pain all the time? I feel like I've been sacked off and dismissed by him. He told me basically to grin and bear it with the pain and hope that it goes away. I don't know what to do, can anybody help? Is it worth going back to my GP and asking for a second opinion or questioning which dept to go to next? I've been gynae and gastro and they can't find an issue, I'm really worried something has been missed. I cannot carry on with this pain much longer, I am really at the end of my tether and just want to stop fighting the pain now.
Can anybody help? Thank you.

"Hi all,
I thought I would start this thread to a) get some tips on handling IBS and b) share what is working for me at the moment.
I've had IBS for a number of years but only recently worked out what it really was! If I am honest I thought it was pretty standard but apparently not! Mine is always worst in the morning and used to cause real issues, not just because of the embarrassment / pain but also being late for work etc!
Over the last few months I've made some changes to my lifestyle and it has really helped so I wanted to share and also see if anyone else had any top tips I could try.
So I have done the following...
1. Stopped eating fatty / greasy food - fry ups, chippies, dodgy pizzas are all gone!
2. Stopped any high caffeine drinks - luckily I never liked coffee so it wasn't hard to stop that but I've ditched the mid afternoon red bull in the office!
3. Stopped rushing in the morning as stress seemed to make everything worse - downside is it means getting up earlier and ironing the shirt the night before but it really helps.
4. Stopped eating really rich food like curry with sauces (if we get a takeaway with friends I just have dry meat and a roti! Boring but worth it)
5. Started drinking Aloe Vera Juice - a bit of an odd one I know but my girlfriend swore by it (to the point she now sells it!) it tastes rank but has made a huge impact on my overall 'health' when it comes to IBS. Would recommend that one as a top tip!
So those are mine. What else has worked for other people?

"Hello, 
The Illness i have, i dont think it Irritable Bowel Syndrome but its similar, it does involve my stomach and bowels. So I hope you can help?
Ever since i was a baby, I have had extreme agnoy pain undernearth my belly button which i know involves my stomach and bowels. The pain comes in a wave but doesnt move and it can be so serious that i can vomit if the pain gets too much. However i dont have diarrhea at all. The pain can last days to months and can normally be worse when excitement or stress is involved which happens with upcoming events. I have tried many different ways of taken my minds off the pain, walking around and excersing seems to ease it but when i sit or eat it becomes worse. I dont eat very much anyways because of this pain and it use to effect me on the night but now it effects me early mornings. 
I hope this problem can be solved
Thanks

"Hi all, I've been putting off seeing a dr for a while now but I've got an appointment next week. I wanted to share my symptoms anyway and see if anyone else has experience similar as inevitabley the dr's process will be slow.
For about 6 months now I've had a constant feeling of pressure on my rectum, not a strong feeling, but feels like my body is automatically try to push something out. My stools have been smelly and are often quite messy (sorry for the graphic details), but not diahorrea like. I usually start the day ok, but after eating regular meals, I'm having to go to the loo 3-5 times a day, and by the end of the day it can be quite sore. I don't have any stomach pains or cramps, nausea, I've not lost weight, still have energy etc. If I'm standing for too long on a train for example, I feel like I need to hold my bowels, even though nothing is happening, the pressure seems to increase when stood up. I just feel like I can continually go to the toilet for a number 2.
I've tried cutting out dairy as I thought it might be a lactose intolerance, but this didn't make any difference. I eat a fairly balanced diet. I don't know if the two issues are connected or not, the stools and bowel movements/vs the constant rectal pressure. Anyone got any thoughts?

"I would like to offer a few words of hope to those suffering from IBS.
I don't really know what is worse, the stress and pain caused by IBS or the worry it causes when you think there is something seriously wrong with you like I did.
So far I have had a colonoscopy, four X rays, a CT scan and a gastro intestional examination with an endoscope down the throat. They found absolutely nothing. Can you imagine how much all this lot costs, no wonder the NHS is in trouble with money. I paid for the colonoscopy myself because I was in a big panic worrying about what was wrong with me.
I got on very well with consultant who carried out the procedure at the hospital and he explained about the stress that IBS sufferers like me put themselves through. He pointed out that this further exasibated the condition.(I hope I have spelt this correctly as it is not a common word in my vocabularly.) He also said that women were more likely to coplain about pain on the right side at the bottom of their ascending large colon and although exhaustive test had been carried out, he had found absolulely nothing physically.
My reason for writing this is to try and convince you not to worry.
There is obviously something not quite right in us but it will NOT kill us, it's just a blasted nuisance and something we have got to learn to live with. I found a change of diet, drinking lots of water, more exercise and taking life a bit easier helped me.
I am experimenting with some supplements from my local health shop. If I come up with something that works I will be back on this forum and share the information immediately.
Wishing you all the very best

"Hello- I haven't posted on here in a while as I think I've had my ibs under control until now. I'm 19 years old and Last night i had the worst ibs attack I have ever had and now I'm really worried. It started yesterday at about 5pm , 2 hours after id eaten French stick with garlic cheese and a doughnut- two hours later I started to have tummy cramps and felt really sick- I tried eating dinner but couldn't manage it and went to bed with a hot water bottle and I started to feel a bit better and went to sleep- BUT an hour later at around midnight I woke with the worst pain in my tummy id ever felt and I thought I was going to be sick and had a real urge to go to the toilet so ran and had a bowel movement it wasn't watery but just loose with no form. After this i still had the sick feeling and thought i was going to puke but i didn't. I was in bed with the most excruciating stomach pains i took an antispasmodic but it didn't work.. I was uncontrollably shaking kept needing a wee and was really thirsty and didn't get to sleep until half three. Now my muscles back and tummy feel really sore maybe from the shaking and straining but I'm worried its more than ibs. I've had mris, stool samples, blood tests and im seeing a dietician in january- but so far everything is shown normal. Please help me, are these symptoms normal for an ibs attack? Was it the garlic cheese? Any feedback would be so appreciated thanks- maisie xx

"hi justwanted to ask if anyone knows of anywhere that has info on extreme ibs, briefly, few years ago started getting unwell feelings after eating, over time less and less food would trigger it. then alternating bowel symptoms, nauseusness after eating, then the stomach cramps and pains, and my stomach producing gas at very fast rate, stomach feels like boiling kettle. ive had a year of tests now to rule out everything else. lost about 7 stone and am at point now where pretty much any food will trigger symptoms which all seem to react off each other. meds im on are tablet that makes anything go straight through stomach and very strong laxative drinks. im managing wieght now drinking complans and fortijuices, this way only couple symptoms are active, any food especially meat triggers all over a period of an hour or so, and i have to lay down final CT scan few weeks ago. met with consultant few days ago, this one was apparently to one the specialists go to when stumped. his final report is a rare and extreme case of ibs. he said it uncureable and permanent, and i wont work ever again. i now need to ask work to retire me on ill health. and wanted something to show that its real, as im sure they dont believe me, to be honest im finding it hard to believe. im only 47 so i really need to convince work to have any sort of future. i will have report from consultant, but will that be enough

"Hi all
I wonder if anyone can help. Over the last 3 months or more i have developed a contstant grumbling and wind movement which i feel going on in my upper abdomen/stomach itself.
The noises are not very load but loud enough for you can hear them. What gets to me is the wind feelings and movement its like having a gremlin in my stomach with wind moveing around all the time. I notice it most after my main meal in the evening when i sitting relaxed its on none stop from the time ive swallowed my food  till bedtime. It goes on through the night as when i wake for the toilet its still there. It seems to settle by morning but the whole process starts again. It probably happens in the day but because im on the go you dont notice it so much.
It is really getting me down as its so chronic. I have tried pepermint tablets, charcoal tablets etc..
My doctor seems to think its senstive upper bowel but i have no medication as he thought it may have been the antacids i was on. Ive been off them now for 4 weeks and the problem is still there if not worse.
I was on a strong course of ant acids and gaviscon for 3 months due to LPR (airway reflux) but i have finished this now.
Should i try colefac its driving me mad and im getting very depressed about it.
Thanks Pete

I suffer at the moment Chronic IBS and GAD....my GAD is causing my symptoms to worsen....and therefore I am freaking out thinking this must be something more serious which leads to more anxiety leading to more pain. The pain is upper abdomin, sharp pains....but also, around the whole stomach, feeling bloated with lots of trapped wind and my mind is going crazy. Are any of you guys feeling the same? I feel like my symptoms, the upper and lower abdoman pains, the wind, the anxiety are all leading to something more...but I am trying to accept this is IBS and GAD the way they affect each other....any advice would be great and if you could share you pains also...I deal with them throughout the day, my GAd I believe causes the IBS pains throughout the day

"I've been having these problems for the last 12 years or so that have caused me a lot of worry and contributed to me not moving on in life for a long time.  The doctors never found anything wrong with me. 
They seemed to start when I was about 20 years old,  I'd been taking a lot of drugs, alcohol, and generally not looking after myself properly.  I turned myself into a nervous wreck and this seems to be when it started.
I get these weird sensations that I couldn't put my finger on but now I can describe it as a scratchy sort of tightness in my lower stomach and pelvic area where I can't relax.  It affects my genitals (penis, I'm a male), it would feel strange, a tight pulling sensation underneath, shrunken.  This would cause me great anxiety that there was something wrong down there.
The uncomfortable feeling would last for about 3 days to a week, gradually tapering off.
Not only that it would affect my nerves in my arms, legs, and all over really.  I would get noticable muscle spasms, tension in my head and my eyes would feel strained and look dilated.  I would worry that there was something wrong with my nervous system then too.  That I had damaged myself permanetly with all that I had done.  
Now I just think that this was all just sensations of anxiety feeding into the problems.
Over the years I have noticed paterns of things that trigger my symptoms. Back then I used to drink to self medicate as I used to get the problem pretty much every week.  I came to realise that alcohol triggered it, or maybe alcohol came to tigger anxiety that came to trigger it.  I know that drinking too much cola seems to trigger my symptoms.  If I have an important event coming up that I'm worried about, or that I worry about having the problem on the event, this seems to trigger it.  Also recently I have found a patern with doing too much strenuous execise without enough rest (I push myself too hard).
Over the years though, it doesn't seem to happen as much and the symptoms aren't as severe.  I put this down to lifestyle changes and improvement in health.  I don't drink alcohol at the moment, I don't smoke, I try to eat healthily and I exercise regularly.  I'm not as anxious or depressed (on going mental health problems) these days and I've learnt to relax more so maybe this helps.  
When it does happen though usually about every 1 or 2 months it really gets me down.  I feel like I can't go out and do the things I normally do, and when I do I feel ashamed that people can notice that there's something wrong with me as it's usually acompanied by this anxious feeling with my eyes looking glased and odd.  I get this gassy feeling and can't relax and sometimes panic.  I sometimes take valium and this eases the symptoms although I don't like doing this but I get so angry and frustrated.  I've just recently thought it may be IBS as my mother suffers from it and my brother has had problems with his stomach in the past due to stress

"Well here i am again. After been admitted to hospital last week and an emergency scan absolutely nothing can be found. They were worried about my apendix then thought it could be gyny related but nope apart from something gyny related that was picked up its not the cause of my pain. 
The constant stabbing pains every minute of every day just got too much so when home from hospital decided to try and cut out wheat....for 6 days now no stabbing pains yay me...did have milk yesterday and this morning and have a little discomfort so wondering if that is also causing the pains.
The Paleo 'diet' seems to be the best option at present rather than the FODMAP as that is very restritctive and i love garic and onions and im fine with those.
Strange thing is lager is fine as well so can drink that too.
I dont have to worry about to the loo never had done and never really suffered with any bowel problems so ibs its not.
Please have a look at Paleo if you are suffering every day with constant mintue by minute stabbing pains.
Good luck with everything peeps x

"I came down with ibs in high school but didn't know it until I went to a different doctor when I was in college. He gave medicine that really helped, since I had my daughter I can't remember what it was called for I had to stop taking it when I was pregnant. I see a lot of you talking about back pain. I was having back pain too. In 1997 I went to see a chiroprator and I had found their is a spot in your spine that if it is knotted it causes stomach pain. I had less attack going in for adjustments. Stress, some family members, and the smell of strong smelly foods were my triggers. Its called food allutions, sorry spelled wrong. Its not that allergic to the food but the smell of it. One smell of my moms onion chip and I was sick for days. Seeing the chiroprator helped a lot. Getting on the meds helped. Avoiding food that triggered the attacks helped. Also what helped was when the family members that triggered it cut us out of there lifes helped. I hope this helped. If I can help just ask. I know ibs hurts.

"Hi Anyone out there with IBS and LPR who has taken omeprazole and has come off this drug.  If so what were your rebound symptoms?  Were they different or worse because of the IBS.  If omeprazole it taken for Gerd and heartburn is the main problem then I know that rebound symptom is worse heartburn often lasting a few weeks.  I have never really had heartburn which is typical of LPR (not diagnosed going by throat symptoms).  I now have rebound symptoms from omeprazole after 7/8 weeks use.  They are bloated acidy stomach,burping,indigestion feels like you want to burp and sometimes feeling sick but no heartburn as before.  I am taking gavscon advance and for the last 24 hours have gone back on ranitidine although not pleased about this.  I have ordered some DGL licorice as I have heard it is good.  Apart from this I take meberverine for the IBS and other medication for various health problems.  I am 67.  Just wondered what are the range of rebound symptoms and how long did they last etc.  Bad enough having IBS with out extra problems.  I should add that I suffer from anxiety especially health anxiety so that does not help matters.

"Hello!
I am having some pretty serious symptoms for the past month that include constipation, gas (excessive belching and stomach bloating), minor cramping, ribbon like stools (with stool softener) and no pain.
I've been seeing a GI specialist when these symptoms went beyond 2 weeks. He put me on lax's for a month, but 2 weeks later, I told him it was not getting better and now I am schedule for a colonoscopy. So, I'm trying to be proactive in finding out if this is IBS or something worse like colon cancer.
My question to the group is really a duration question to put my mind at ease. Does IBS ever present itself in constipation for a month or longer? What I mean by that is, infrequent bowel movements with gas and bloating with the constipation for that duration?
I've read a lot about IBS, but it seems many people have weekly flare ups. I haven't really seen people say they have had similar to symptoms to mine where it's a duration of about a month and then stops.
I only ask because I am a 32 year old male and had my symptoms a year and a half ago for about 3 weeks. After that, it cured itself up until a month ago when it started back up again out the blue.

"Hi, I'm new on here but have been reading the IBS posts lately.  I am getting myself in a right state as for the past couple of months my IBS symptoms have changed in that I am suffering from intermittent low back ache and twinges in abdomen.  Also, if I need to go to the loo, I really have to run whereas I can usually have time to search around for a loo.  There is no blood or mucus but another different change is that I don't always feel better after I've been to the loo, sometimes feel more achey and sickly.  I had a bout of gastroenteritis back in June whilst on holiday in Spain and these symptoms have all escalated since that really.  Trouble is, I read Dr Google and of course, changes in bowel habits mean bowel cancer or pancreatic cancer and I'm not sleeping through worry and panic and am planning my funeral etc.  Especially after the Lynda Bellingham saga, it's even more hopeless as I am convinced that now it will be too far gone to be treated and I can't even bring myself to go to the doctors as I get myself in such a state waiting for tests and results that I am ill before any treatment would have to start....has anybody else had these sort of issues with IBS?  I have suffered for some 20 years or so on and off but not as bad as this lately.  I am 57 so worried that my age is against me in having a non cancerous condition....thanks.

"i was working for jacobs engineering on a massive pcb contaminated soil clean up. we were sacking the material it involved alot of lifting and bending but i felt something rip or tear in my lower left abdomen and immediately got dizzy it randomly started happening and dont know if the dizziness was related to the tearing incident. at first it was stationary i dont feel it when i first wake up until like 45 minutes after im awake but it varys from a deep burning to a sting and sometimes an itchy sensation, i cant pinpoint where it is coming from somewhere in the middle. i sometimes feel it move around when it is in the itchy stage the pain radiates down to my left foot at times rotating my foot sort of helps like it is sciatica.
i got a endoscopy, catscan, xray blood draws all to no success, the doctors do not take me seriously it is a native hospital as i do not have insurance. they said i have a scar on my stomach and it is very thin and mild intestinal metaplasia they said my stomach looked like an intestine the weird thing is is that the doctors said it looked awesome after the procedure and i had to go find this information out for myself 3 months later... what scares me is lately i been having that same feeling moving to the other side just not as intense there is a large history of cancer on my mothers side stomach cancer of her mother, mothers sister intestinal, her mothers dad had stomach cancer an her grandma had cancer... my dads dad died of intestinal cancer and i was raised in port heiden a former ww2 station with massive contamination and cancer rate is high....my stool seems to not have the size it used too and dont feel like i can empty my bowel fully like usual... what are the chances they overlooked cancer somewhere or could they have not seen a hernia or something...if i dont eat my whole abdomen becomes VERY irritated but the pain is just to my left and a little down from my belly button
any advice on this would be very appreciatedthe doctor at another hospital tested my stool and said their was a little blood that had been digested already

"Hi, I'm new to this but I've got a really strange problem. I'm due to see the doctors soon but I am so scared that everything I say will just be dismissed as IBS (as I have been diagnosed with it years ago) - the worrying thing about it is that these pains are very unfamiliar and I have been told by someone I know who has endometriosis that all my symptoms seem all too familiar to her - and that a lot sufferers of this get misdiagnosed with IBS. Not saying it's endometriosis as I have not been tested or anything, it's jsut the misdiagnosis factor that scares me - I don't want anything to be missed!! I'm just wondering if anyone would have a clearer idea of what the hell is going on in my body if I listed all important details:
Background:
I'm a 19 year old female, healthy weight (109lbs, 5ft4) and eat an incredibly concious diet - very healthy in that department.
I am definately not stressed, I'm the most relaxed I've ever been, life has never been better! My eating, as I previously said is absolutely fine which used to be a trigger to stomach pains, bloating etc, so I highly doubt it's to do with that.
The Problem:
Generally my ""IBS"" (in quote marks because I'm so wary of the term) has been under control for about 2 years - not been affected for ages, about 6 weeks ago I got a throbbing pain I'd never had before, on the left of my stomach which was more of a discomfort than anything else, a bit of pressure on it helped as with most things. That night I fainted. (I do have a history of being a big fainter, but this was scary because I haven't fainted in a long time and because of the pain I'd been feeling in the day.) After that, I began to feel a bit better.
On to this week though! I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the loo, felt absolutely fine but within seconds of walking into my bathroom I got some of the worst upper abdominal pains I've experienced. I could barely walk, I lay on my floor to stop myself fainting, crawled into my other room to get some painkillers and back into my bedroom to lie on my bed. So much pain that it took me 10 full minutes to pluck up the courage to turn a little to my side to get some water and swallow the painkillers, the thought of moving was too much - even to stop the pain! Since then it's been absolute hell. Pains are constant, sometimes not as sevre as others but always there...strange thing is that they change place. I have experienced throbbing pain on the left of my stomach, upper abdominal pain, an upper abdominal empty ache, aching on the right of my stomach, sharp pains on both the left and right side near my hips and oddly enough pains in my back. The pains in my back weren't sharp, throbbing or achey, just very, very sensitive, as if someone had punched me in my kidney or on the other side and if someone constantly had their hand on the very big and sore bruise they left. Very painful. These pains switch over all the time and move around and are always a different kind of pain - but I am never without one. It makes me feel very nauseaus too. It's been about 5 days and I am so sick of not feeling well, not being able to dance with my friends when we're out because it hurts and just constantly worrying because I can't find anything remotely similar to my problems!
Other potential important information:
Very fatigued - but I have always been, especially this year as I have had the Depo injection for contraception and have been bleeding for an entire year now. It's tiring. So I'm not sure if that's part of this.
I have been known as a big fainter (first time I fainted I was 4) but this has become less regular over the years, usually it comes with an obvious reason now.

"My doc suspects I have IBS. This evening I had an ultrasound scan for which I had to fast for 6 hours prior to scan. (i actually fasted for 6.5 hours to make sure). During the scan the sonographer, who clearly has had a sense of humour bypass at some point, insisted I MUST have eaten during that time and said something about gall bladder (I wasn't really listening to be honest as I found her incredibly rude, obnoxious and boring). Anybody else had this before or know why she would think I had eaten when I had literally starved myself and was dying for food by then?

"So ive had a stabbing pain constantly in my right side under my rib cage for over a year. Had unimaginable pain that lastest for over 5 hours and he sent me for scans for gallbladder...guess what negative. I also told him i had some vaginal bleedin...guess what dismissed. Told i have ibs. Had another attack of pain which was like a tight band around my rib cage...couldnt stand sit or get comfortable so i ended up rocking backwards and forwards on all fours every time a cramp came i was nearly in tears....meds...guess what didnt work. Another doc said if it lasts for more than 5 hours go to A and E...it lasted for 4..again ibs. Had a bad stabbing pain last thursday and woke to looking like i was 6 monts pregnant with some bleeding. Had some pain last night and woke this morning to more bleeding...not much just stopping and stopped by mid morning. So called docs to get another check up. This doc took me seriouslt and did an internal check...what she thought was a fibriod on my left side and felt lumps on my right ovary. Definately gyno she said so bloods to be done thurs and scan in a few weeks. Dont know what to think or what to do....if its cancer ive been living with it for over a year now...the thought of this is making me really really scared.
Please if anything changs for you get it checked out ASAP

"Hi,
Started a 100% gluten free diet 6 days ago. I have been very very strict with my food intake.
Are there any symptoms ppl get during recovery from gluten? I seem to be getting some strange symptoms like lower stomach pain, feel like I have loads more energy, sinus's seem to be clear, no headaches. The diahrrea has ceased and I had a totally normally poo this morning. I didn't even have to rush back for a 2nd attempt! Lol.
Just wondering whether I should increase the probiotic and prebiotic intake? Do ppl who go gluten free often get gas and wind during recovery? I'm just looking for signs my body is recovering and I'm doing the right things to improve recovery. I'm hoping this isn't a temporary fix and the gluten is what's causing my ibsd!

"I won't go into gory details, but I was diagnosed with ibs d. I was quite poorly with it last year and didn't think I'd get better. But I am now virtually symptom free and wanted to share how I went about it. I know we're all different,  but I hope some of what I did will help others.
1. I kept a food diary of everything I ate and my symptoms to try and track problem foods.
2. I suspected wheat and dairy as being an issue and so went on a gluten and dairy free diet for a couple of months.
3. I looked up info on soluble and insoluble fibre and tried to balance my intake out, eating more soluble fibre.
4. I started taking probiotics in tablet form-multibionita is the brand I used.
5. I read that gelatin was good for the gut and so I upped my intake-eating a small pot of jelly or haribo a day.
6. I reduced the amount of fruit juice I drank.
Once I managed to stabilise myself with a plain diet, I gradually added food back into my diet,  a new food every 3 days or so to see if I reacted. If I reacted, I didn't eat it again.
I now eat most food, i have lactofree milk still and try avoid white processed bread as that can start mild symptoms off and am a little wary of new foods, especially sauces and coatings.
I have no medical training, but this combination of things I did, mostly gleaned from various sites has worked for me and I hope my experience and months of trying different things will help others.

"Hi I'm new to the forum and I'm after a bit advice. 
I'm 54 years old and 5 month ago got diagnosed with ibs. I also suffer with severe depression and anxiety. 
My symptoms started 5 months ago and have now got so bad I can't cope with life anymore. I've not left the house in 4 weeks. And during that time my ibs and anxiety caused me to become dehydrated and since then my bowel movements haven't been the same.
5 months ago my symptoms started as a lot of mucus everything I went to the toilet sometimes without passing a stool. The doctor said that I was OK and that I had ibs. Then I had an episode of watery stools which caused the most excruciating pain that scared the life out of me and that then made me scared to eat because I didn't want to get that pain again. 
At the moment my bowels are all over the place one minute I have the runs then I'm having proper stools. I'm going insane(I have been diagnosed as a hypochondriac and so this has caused me to think I'm dieing of so many illnesses). 
I put 2 stool tests in they both came back clear and blood tests came back clear. At the moment everytime  I pass wind I poo myself. Or I pass mucus. 
What I want to know is how to cope with it I'm finding it so hard I just want my life back. I take Buscapan and lopermide. 
Please help!!

"Hi
To cut a long story short I've been testing out my ibs by playing around with my diet and think either Gluten or Wheat is the culprit. Just have a few questions...
1) how do you know when the gut is fully repaired when gluten / wheat is eliminated?
2) if gluten or wheat is damaging / inflaming my guts when I consume it... Would it be fair to say that other foods and drink may cause me issues?
3) say I eliminate wheat / gluten for 2 months and my ibs symptoms disappear, would it be fair to say that I'm less likely to have an ibs attack if I was to consume say a baguette?
I guess from the above 2 questions I'm wanting to know whether eating a small amount of wheat / gluten daily would make me less tolerable than if I quit gluten / wheat from my diet then on the odd occasion eat something containing gluten / wheat how I would feel?
3) is the cause of suddenly becoming intolerant to gluten / wheat known? 5 years ago I could eat whatever I wanted and had no problems.
.........
For those of u interested in what I've been doing to try and find my ibs problem...
 I started taking a probiotic VSL a few months ago. After 2 months I noticed improvement. I then started to heavily analyse my diet. In a controlled condition (same work, sleep, rest, meal...etc) pattern (when I was feeling pretty good) I started to eat food that used to previously irritate and flare up my ibs... This proving whether I have a bacterial issue or a tolerance problem. So I started eating baguettes for lunch... Became slightly bloated... Bought 2 12"" pizza and eat them over 2 nights. Well I felt awful. My stomach went crazy. Woke up in the middle of the night with sweats, had a headache, bloating, aching, foul smelling loose stools. I felt like this for the next 24 hours, so from then on I eliminated all wheat and gluten... Have improved hugely and 4 days later I'm nearing normality. So... My next (and hopefully) final test is to introduce pastas, sauces, breads etc gluten free and see what happens. The main part of this experiment and the final proof of my problem (I'm hoping) will be when I buy exactly the same 2 pizzas this week with the exact toppings, eating them on the exact days I did last week however I'm going to order gluten free pizza bases and see how it goes.
Hopefully if this works... I've found it after nearly 6 years of searching!

"I know. A common question. Here is my story:
Back in 1997 I was ""diagnosed"" with ""suspected IBS"". This was after a barium enema and a few trips to the doctors. It was all around a very stressful time for me (buying my first flat). The symptoms disappeared over time.
Fast forward to 2013 and I went to the Doctor with chest pains. I now know that it was heartburn but at the time I didn't. I had an ECG and had to wait whilst it was referred to a cardiologist. I had to wait several weeks for the results as I was away on holiday and it was a very stressful time. The chest pains went away but (I think due to the stress - hence me mentioning it) I began to get upper abdominal pains. They were below the ribs, left and right and some pain in the centre of the abdomen. The Doctor put me on Omazoprale but it didn't get rid of the symptoms entirely. As the months went on the abdominal pain remained and was joined by back ache, muscle aches (legs, joints, knees, what feel like muscle aches in the stomach), bloating and going to the toilet a lot more often that usual (6 times like Saturday). The muscle aches (back, top of legs and stomach) are worse when moving around. Symptoms are relived by going to the toilet, some times the relief is a amazing, other times not so much.
I have had a full blood count, all fine. Test for HPylori - all clear and an ultrasound, again all clear.
I have tried Colpermin which helped a bit but didn't completely get rid of the abdominal pains. Then on to Buscopan which had a massive positive effect on the abdominal pain but made me feel weird and also seemed to make the backache/muscle aches worse. I moved in to Colfac which has reduced abdominal pain and made a massive difference to toilet frequency. It has reduce the backache and muscle aches but has seemed to increase wind and bloating. I have also played with changing the diet, caffeine free, whet and dairy reduction, this seem to be very slightly helping.
Anyway, the above is my story. I have an appointment with the gastro expert on Monday. My Doctor is now convinced that it is IBS. He says that it is rare to have upper abdominal pain IBS but is becoming more common. I wonder if any of you think that he/I are barking up the wrong tree and/or any tips for how to get rid of the muscle ache/back ache. It's a real pain!

"Firstly I'd just like to say Hello to everyone, I joined the site today hoping to pick your brains for any wealthy knowledge.
I've been suffering with different forms of Anxiety on and off for my whole life, I'm now 21. In the last 8 months it's been the turn of IBS caused by Anxiety, something I've never experienced before. I can't leave my house without the urge needing the loo, I get cramps, can't drink any alcohol etc.
For the last month I've been getting VERY Bloated, almost like I'm a pregnant man, lots of burping, and sometimes feeling sick. These mixed with some mild low abdomen cramps isn't the most pleasant situation to be in. I shall be speaking with my Doctor again next week, but I'm curious to know if anyone else here suffers with the same issue?
Thank you,

"Hi Everyone,
The last few weeks have been non-stop, mega-decibel stomach growling and enough wind to sail the Spanish Armada around the world in 3 days! Not cramps but discomfort and quite a bit of bloating. In-the-background stress which always hits me in the stomach so that I don't want to eat. Have lost weight for no reason. The stomach grumbling starts within minutes of me eating/drinking anything and the the wind for hours and hours and hours; have cut out most dairy and don't eat much gluten anyway and it affects me no matter what I put down my throat. It's so embarrassing especially as I'm just starting a new relationship and he doesn't like tummy grumbles....!

"Hello
I have spent hours trying to work out what ibs is all about.
a) What has caused my condition?
b) How can I cure it rather than just keep it at bay?
The experts don't seem to have much idea.
It all started about 3 years ago with pain in my decending colon and then in my groin area. At the same sort of time I became sensitive to coffee, alcohol spicy foods, fats, vinegar and lemon juice.
My GP has given me peppermint oil and Pregablin. Pregablin is good for general neuropathic pain associated with diabetes but much less affective on ibs pain.
ibs does get worse if you are stressed about something.
I have had a Colonoscopy, several X rays and a CT scan and you see absolutely nothing.
If you have any ideas, I would love to hear from you.
Best regards

"Hi, I have been experiencing pain in my upper abdomen for the past few months. The doctors thought it was Appendicitis at first, because the pain was in the lower abdomen at first, and took me off food, scanned my abdomen, did everything they were supposed to do for Appendicitis, but they found nothing out of the ordinary. 
Fast forward to another month or so. The pain moved upwards, to my upper abdomen, and the doctors couldn't help me at all. I stopped going for checkups, and one day my poop was just white watery mucous. No poop at all. 2nd time it happened, it was yellow watery mucous. Very disgusting, but I have to describe it properly. Then a few weeks ago, my poop was just diarrhoea with undigested vegetables floating in it. It stunk a lot, but I'm not sure about the degree of stinkiness hahaha. I've tried to search for help online, and some people told me that it might be IBS, or coeliac disease, or Crohn's. How can I check? Thanks in advance...

I read that this test can cause constipation stomach pains etc.  I am thinking of cancelling it because knowing me I will suffer for ages afterwards.  I also have arthritis pain to contend with.

"Dear All..a little help please! 
For years when I have flown to the US, I am struck down the night after the flight with the most excruciating abdominal pain. For the ladies, think of the worst period pain ever! 
I would have slept for a few hours then be worken by this unbelievable pain, dash to the loo to then pass a dark green/brown fluid (no sign of blood). I usually crawl back on to the bed moaning. It passes. Then the next spasm hits me. Hard. I dash to the loo in fear I need it but nothing usually after the first or second visit. I don't know whether to sit or stand. Sometimes the pain is that bad that I will vomit. The Spasms start off very frequent then more time lapses between each one. The whole attack lasts about 7/8 hours. During this time my stomach is extremely bloated. 
Previously we have always put it down to airline food/air cabin pressure.
Recently had two attacks at home in the UK. Which has made me question is it actually stress causing it? Before I go to the US I am usually very stressed at work and stressed with the paperwork we have to carry (Roadtrip Photography, so tons of paperwork). It never happens after the homebound flight. It happened following our wedding. And just recently was after a particularly stressful day in the office and a family funeral, which has made me question is it IBS rather then an unlucky upset stomach! 
It just strikes me as odd that I can go to bed and be woken six hours later by this agony. 
Help? Is it IBS? I can go months without an attack, even a year. But recently I have had two in four weeks. Got to see the GP in September. Hoping he agrees and says yes, take Buscopan for the pain.  Have tried normal painkillers, it makes it worse. Tried Milk of Magnesia as well. Again I just bring it back up. 
 Any ideas? Many thanks!

"Hello, so around 3 months ago I started excessivly using RENNE to cure my nervous tummy caused by anxiety, little did I know that renne would give me very bad constipation and ended up making my upset tummy even worse! Ever since I overcome that constipation and ditched the renne, I've had a burning feeling in my tummy and lower abdomen (more so my lower abdomen). Around a month a go I decided to see my doctor and I was perscribed omeprazole, which again lead to horrible, painful constipation. For the time I was on them it did cure the burning feeling.
Right now, I still have the burning feeling - it's uncomfortable but goes away once I've eaten. My bowel movements are pretty regualr and stools are normal but this burning feeling is really starting to bother me and I hope it doesn't get worse - and I really hope it's not IBS or something. I'm starting to think that maybe taking all the antacids is what's caused the burning feeling in the first place? I'm not sure wether to just see if it clears up on it's own? I don't want to be perscribed more antacids if it's just making it worse.
I'm also not sure if stress and anxiety is making all of this worse? I am seeking help for that though.

"Hi my name is Coryn and I am on my Wits end..
I am 18 and spent the last 4 and a half years In and out of hospitals, Doctors, Specialists and I can't handle it no more I NEED to know that someone out there has the same issue As me.
It all started at about 15, I woke up one morning And I felt like my Kidney or Appendix  was exploding Inside of me it was horrible. My nan rushed me to the GP where I was told I had indigestion and he gave me some gaviscon and told me to take it till I felt better. about 2-3 weeks later I was still In awful pain so again I went back to the doctor where I was then told that I was Consitpated, Again I got some medicine thrown at me and I walked away, I took this for 4 weeks (4 WEEKS!) and nothing happened. 
So again I went back this time a little more frustrated, This is when I was told I had IBS, I trusted the doctors and got given more medicine and went home I took this for 2 months, Again Nothing happened So this time I went back I was defo annoyed.
This is when they stopped helping me And Everything went downhill, For the next year I couldn't get off the sofa I spent my days watching Netflix, I changed my Diet, Ate more Fibre, Drank more water done everything I could yet still nothing!
I soon became bed ridden and at 16 I met a guy, I would stay at his place and I would be so Ill he would look after me the amount of A&E trips we did was unreal.
I now live with him and I am now 18, I am still going through these problems And I now go to the gym 3 times a week, Do yoga, Pilates Each majorly healthy, Good fibre amounts and drink the right amount of water I should, I Take two sennas at night, And do as much As I physically can.
But again still sick, I had a colonoscopy a few months ago they found nothing worrying I was also meant to have an Endoscopy but I had a major panic attack and couldn't do that! 
I am doing a stool sample soon But Its destroying me, I now have depression and I have anxiety and I know it is from this So that wont help either, The thing Is I am no longer constipated I am going tot hr toilet 2-4 times a day and it is not normal Either It is Very soft, watery stools, It has mucus sometimes and sometimes even has blood.
The worst of it is the fact that I constantly feel Nausea And that makes me feel so poop...
Anyone else like this, There is more to it but I dont want to bore you !

"This is only my 2nd time posting I'm pretty new on here but it helped me so so much when you guys answered my last post. Helped more than anything to hear I'm not alone and you genuinely understand. I dunno about everyone's specific time span for trips to the toilet but mine follows a very specific pattern when it strikes. Hot/cold sweats, waves of a kinda stinging achey pain over lower pelvic area, sheer panic in my head and sometimes dizziness and headache tho that's usually after. First few times I could be in there maybe 10 mins each then a beak of 10mins untill the next wave of pain and urgency. After a few times then the pure water diarrhea etc happens and I can spend literally up to 1hr straight in there no lie, untill the last bit's gone and I can feel the pain leave my body with that last go. How on earth do in deal with that should it happen in work? Dunno how I've avoided for all these years but it is a matter of time and worrying about it will make it sooner rather than later. I couldn't even go home cause I wouldn't make it I'd need to use a toilet ASAP.  I know I'm rambling but this is the first time I've known others like me. x

"Been diagnosed with IBS, and put on Mebervine three times daily. However, these seem to be making my IBS related symptoms worse. However, I have noticed of late I am producing hell of a lot more wind, stomach upset complaints and a change in bowel movements.
I have had routine bloods that ruled other things out such as Cealiac disease. I had an abnormality in the number of Enzymes in the liver whatever that means.. Need to bloods redone in 4 weeks which is soon.
Also, I have a feeling of pressure under my rib cage where I feel as though there is a blockage, and I get a sensation where cold drinks etc can pass this blockage - Just a feeling, haven't discussed with Dr.
I also keep belching and it feels as though acid is travelling all the way up from my abdo to my mouth, with one burp.
Are all these related, and is Mebeverine doing the trick? Stick with them or back to GP?

"Hi there,
I perhaps should have wrote this a long time ago, but things are coming to an inpass and I need to write this down and see if I'm going crazy or not.
I'm a 33 year old male, in a full time job, and enjoy what I'm doing very much. I don't feel pressurised by what I do there at all and am confident that I deliver - all except in one area (which I'll get to as it is directly in proportion to what I type below).
For about 10 years now (since stopping Alcohol and recreational drugs) I've had a few issues in relation to my bowels. I find it very hard to hold water, and whenever I feel any type of pressure I have to go to the loo. More recently, in the last four years I have also been having a lot of trouble with my stomach - always aching and upset and have been having issues in that department too (going very often).
Bearing in mind I've never had an accident, my day to day life is being affected by this, I've not been able to travel (long distance) anywhere in years, in the fear of needing the toilet and one not being available.
I tend not to watch movies at the cinema anymore, accompany friends on days out, even go shopping for food at a big supermarket in case I find myself in need.
More recently, I've been panicking in the mornings, I cannot handle a 15/30 minute commute on public transport to my work... I panic and worry about if there are roadworks/traffic issues or the bus is busy and I have to share a seat with someone. I dread having the feeling in my guts somewhere where there isn't a loo.... I've ended up taking direct Taxi's at great expense to and from work because I don't want to be around other people and I'm constantly afraid of having an accident.
I'm in the position in my job where my attendance is not mandatory at all meetings but I tend to find myself subconsiously booking time off or feigning illess when I have meetings that I have to attend - again just in case I can't hold my bowels for more than 1 or 2 hours.
My GP has not really helped so far ..I've been told (after tests) I do not suffer from IBS or Crohn's. My bladder muscles are in fine working order as well as the Pelvic muscles but they have given me tablets to this regard (to tighten up muscles)... ( I have a healthy sex life with my partner, which is not affected by this..)
I'm at a loss, my life sucks, I don't go out anymore... or if I do I'm in constant worry that I'm going to have an accident.
Is this all in my head, having dealt with it for 10 years and progressively get worse? Is it anxiety or problems with my bowels, is it actually problems with my body I don't know..
Thanks for listening... Ben

"During middle school I was dealing with a lot at school , from bullying to homework . I was just under alot of stress. In the 8th grade I started having this gurgling noise in my stomach & It was kinda uncomfortable and most of all it was embarrassing. So I decided to go to the doctor and the doctor kept diagnosing it as a stomach virus. But in my heart I knew that there was something wrong. So I went to high school with the same noises and gurgling. But when I got to high school it got worse it started to turn into spasms, constant diarrhea  , loud growling noises, just extreme abdominal pain. Mind you that all of this was going on through class. I started to be afraid to eat lunch because every time I would eat , it would get worse. I finally went to a gastroenterologist and went through a serious of procedures which led to the diagnosis of IBS . My IBS was so bad in high school that I had to miss a lot of school. I feel like IBS took over my life and robbed me of my freedom in high school & I was never comfortable at school because my IBS was so unpredictable. But now at 20, I've tried to do what it takes to keep it under control . I notice that I get really bad IBS pains when someone scares me , or waking up early or after I stress or eat the wrong things. I hope some day that a cute for IBS is found .

"In the middle of July I had a bad bout of diarreah which lasted 3 weeks, everything I ate came straight back out and I had terrible stomach pain, before this bout I was having really foul smelling wind/gas which I still occasionally get. I began to take a probiotic and the diarreah stopped but instead, for a couple of weeks I would not have a bowel movement for 3 days then I would and it would be a solid movement (not constipated).
Most of my pain seems to be upper abdominal around the rib cage and focuse a bit more onto the right hand side. At the moment bowel movements seem a bit more normal and regular (1 a day) but the dull ache and bloating feeling is still there and it is constantly there. I still exercise  regularly and eat very well. Part of me wonders if I have made my gut hypersenstive as before July I cut out Gluten, Eggs and Dairy as was told intolerant, then I had a stag do, wedding and holiday where alcohol was consumed and some of these foods and the diarreah started a week after the stag do, normally I dont drink that much at all and I feel this may have upset my gut balance?
My blood tests have come back with no inflammatory markers, and the stool test  had when I had diarreah came back normal so no virus. I am waiting to have a sigmoidoscopy as I think GP wants to rule out Colitis.
Wondered if anyone has anything similar, my general diet is , gluten free oats with cinnamon and blueberries for brekkie, chicken salad with g'f wrap, dinner normally a good piece of lean meat/protein with brocolli, basmati rice and veg. I eat lots of fruit and snack on g/f oat bars and pulsin bars. I drink plenty of water and peppermint tea.
Does anyone have an idea of what it is, when I google I get stuff like gastritis, IBS, ulcerative collitis etc...
any help greatly appreciated..

"Hi there
I want to go to my doctors about this but I want to have some sort of idea before I do. 
I'm in my early 20s and for as long as I can remember I've had a weak stomach. From when I was in primary school, probably 8 or 9 I remember walking to school one morning and all of a sudden I needed the toilet. Within a minute or two from thinking I needed to go it was too late and I had messed myself. I was so ashamed that I said a big dog was chasing me and I was scared. 
I often stay home because I find it easier than having to spend 40 minutes in the toilet making sure I won't need to go when I'm out. It's ruining my social life. 
A typical day for me starts with 10 minutes on the toilet. Once I'm sure I am done I get up and go do something for 10 minutes then go back to the toilet for another 10 minutes. I do this probably 3 times before I am confident enough to leave the house. 
I do believe that I suffer from some sort of anxiety. By worrying I might need to go I end up having to. If I am not going out I don't need to go. If I know I am going out that day I seem to go toilet more frequently. 
My stool is almost-always loose. 
For the first time, I took some Imodium when I went abroad and I felt so good. I was so confident having only gone to the toilet once in the morning and even then I didn't really need to go. If only I could have something that I could take that would have this affect on me every day?
I'm not sure what I should say to my doctor as you'll have read, I don't quite know what to say or how to say it. 
Can anyone comment on my situation? What do you think I should go to the doctors for? Maybe I need some anxiety tablets and that'll fix the toilet trouble itself?

"HI all,
I been having major problems with constipation which were made worst by developing internal haemorrhoids couple years ago from weight lifting would appreciate any advice. i’ve had all the tests done over the last 10 years, recent ultra scan and test came up normal. i already suffer from anxiety and depression and going for run, weights was my only release. For last 2 years kinda really worn me down and i just become angry with my body and didn’t care. i started binge drinking twice a week very heavy, it actually helped for while but now has now added to my problems wouldn’t recommend it! My sleep upside down and feeling horrible sometimes allow my mind to wonder but i really want to keep moving on.
So far, i’m in the process of getting my alcohol under control as it’s doing me no favours. Got some sleeping tablets to try restoring my body rhythms, increased my fibre, lighted up on the gym, dealing with stress and trying to be nicer to myself but things are remaining the same and i don’t know what i’m doing wrong?

"Hi
i saw my gastro tonight for first time after two failed attempts at two other gastro's
It went pretty well and he certainly shed some light on my condition.
this is what he's pretty certain it is:
What is FAPS?
Functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS) is a condition of abdominal (belly) pain that is long-term or keeps coming back. The pain is not linked with changes in bowel pattern – constipation and/or diarrhea. It occurs because of abnormal functioning of nerve impulses in the abdomen and brain. The nerves become overly sensitive.
He wants me to try amytrptyline low dose and probiotic with linseeds too.
I am going to start on a course of hypnotherapy as my anxiety is through the roof regarding what i thought was wrong with my stomach as opposed to what probably is wrong. I will keep you posted !

"Ok, so earlier this year I was unwell. I had fever, no appetite, swollen glands, throwing up everything I are and drank. Doctors suspected glandular fever, it was negative. But I recently found out I had cmv, although my sexual health tests show nothing. I also developed bowel issues, I was diagnosed with ibs and it's getting worse. I'm getting horrible pains in my bad and stomach mostly of left side. I also have a varicocele vein too along with every thing. I've seen lots of different docs and have asked them for scans, tests to rule out anything serious but they have refused me. I do have anxiety and tend to over analyse things bit the pain I feel is very real. 
A close family member was diagnosed with breast cancer in March and all of this with me began a week after. I also started a new job that involves standing for 9 hours doing a lot of heavy lifting. 
Doctors prescribed me antibiotics for a bacterial form of tonsillitus. Ever since I was ill I have a lump in my neck on the side that often goes up and down. It's small, hard and it feels slightly movable. My collar bone often aches around the middle of Them both it's sensitive. 
I also get a pain in inner groin when lifting my right leg. It's been there for over a week now. Blood work done in April revealed my liver was off, but I've had them done since and they appear fine. I've seen bloody tinged mucus in the poo. My bowels were all over the place but they seem to have a pattern again now. The pain I experience is difficult to describe but my stomach is always squelching. I've Had solid poops to cow pat like poops. 
Everybody who I've not seen has said I've lost weight, I don't know if I have. There is no previous known cancer in family. I have a blood test Friday to check for diabetes. I'm an active some what healthy 22 year old and I honestly feel as though something serious is happening. I know I'm young but I know of people who have been diagnosed with ibs and have lost their lives because they've had cancer. I've told several doctors all of symptoms and asked for further tests and scans just to know what exactly is happening. I've not been right since April and I'm very scared.

"Okay so I will try and make this short. December 13th 2013 I was at  a Famous Daves for anyone unfamiliar it is a Bar-B-Que restaurant. I ate something I typically would and as soon as I was finished I had to use the restroom which didn't feel right just felt like it was never ending and cramps about 2-4"" below my belly button. I was 45 miles from home and had to stop 2-3 times for diarrhea which was never normal for me I was the type that could eat nasty McDonalds and drive for hours without one stop ever since that day my stomach and digestive system has limited me from doing much of anything. A little while ago I went to the doctor for it did NOT have a stool sample nor a scope done, but blood and urine same done, the doctor claimed IBS is a false diagnosis and there is always a true problem behind it he also found out that I had a kidney infection which was uncommon for a 21 year old male. I was on a brat diet and 3 different types of antibiotics which I did research on and cured most bacteria that would effect my digestive system along with a probiotic. It is now September 7th, 2014 almost 9 months later and I still have this issue but it is on and off. Other symtoms would be flakey stool and mucus in stool although I haven't had diarrhea in a good while, but I want to end this once and for all it is making a HUGE impact on my life I can no longer keep a job because of how severe it can be and I have a 4 month old daughter and its hard to get out of the house and do anything. I am begging I would put myself in the situation of being in debt the rest of my life just to not have to deal with this ever again. I want to feel normal again and be able to do stuff and travel!

"My girlfriend has suddenly become rather ill. We're in the Canary Islands and on our first full day she's suddenly come down with these symptoms leading onto each other
(Note: I've eaten with her from the same places and practically the same food. I've had a couple of moments that indicated there might be a storm on the horizon, but it hasn't turned into anything as yet, yet being 11 hours after she became ill):
feeling uneasy
stomach quickly turning really intense and staying frequent
diarrheoa (light coloured) x2
being sick x2
sudden tiredness
full body sweating (mainly whilst in the toilet)
Now she's had gastroenteritis before where she experienced the same intense cramps and rather considerable blood in her vomit. The doctor wasn't at all overly concerned with the blood and simply said it will go away in x amount of days. It took considerably longer. I don't think she's the healthiest of girls, internally. Although her lifestyle is moderately healthy.
I've got sneaky suspicions she's got something going on inside a little out of the norm, whether menacing or not so much. Obviously NHS GP's need to save money and will pass a set of symptoms off in the first instance quite gladly as matching a no doubt possible condition, but one that costs the least to rectify, thus aiding their practice and the region's health care trust bottom line. So getting further investigation out of them is indeed like drawing blood from a stone.
However, would you say, even in their intensity that the above symptoms are a fine match for simply food poisoning and that as it stands there's no need to have to find out what an EHIC card really does do abroad? (if you catch my drift)

"Hello,
Thought i'd write a new discussion instead of linking to my other IBS one.
I am 20 years old and have tried lots of different tablets and remedies to calm my IBS symptoms. The main symptom is a constant rumbling feeing in my upper abdomen. I recently came off of Fluoxetine as the side effects were so bad I couldn't tolerate it. I am now on Dicycloverine Hydrochloride and have been for 5 days and my stomach is pretty much pain free! The only downside is that I have really bad rerealisation as nothing feels real and I constantly feel as if I am in a dream like state. Has anyone else had these side effects? Will they ever go away? It's so frightening! My heart rate has also slowed right down which I guess is a good thing as I always thought my heart rate was a bit fast. I also feel as though I have trapped wind in the left side of my chest and I have had this feeling for a few days. Any ideas or suggestions on how to stop this? At first I thought I was having a heart attack which doesn't help with my anxiety.

"Hi..
I've had IBS-D for about 10 years now (started age 14 from eating food which contained bad bacteria), can be very on/off - can have symptoms for weeks at a time or no/few symptoms for up to a few months. Definitely is worse with stress.
Symptoms include bloating after meals, wind, stomach cramps, diarrhoea. Main problem is diarrhoea - constantly think about where I'll be able to go to the toilet and hardly ever eat out as it usually bring it on. I can't even take Imodium anymore because it makes be constipated, then I have to take senokot which brings on diarrhoea again! Really takes over my life, especially living and working in London. It's so embarrassing and only have a few friends who I feel I can talk to about it, luckily have a doctor as a mum and a very understanding family!
Have had all the tests which have come back negative - definitely a good thing but sometimes I wish I could be told what food not to eat/how to stop symptoms.

"Hi. My partner has been diagnosed with IBS but we and several other doctors aren't so sure. 5 years ago he started to get a pain across the top of his stomach which turns into severe pain that moves around to the left side of his back. The pain is constantly there but comes in waves which get worse (almost like contractions). Each time he has this pain it is so severe that he has to go to hospital and only morphine will make the pain go away. When he has the pain he has an urge to go to the toilet but is normally very regular and goes every day. The pain can come every week then stop for months then back to every week again, sometimes only days apart and each time a hospital visit is needed. He's been checked for everything and recently been told he has gall stones but they are not causing any problems after regular scans. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Thanks for your help

"I have had a constant 24/7 dull pain between my belly button and right hip for  4 months. It doesn't really bother me but I can always feel it. If you push on the area it's very sore and sensitive but there is no obvious lump or sign of anything being abnormal apart from the dull pain. 
I had a ultrasound to check for hernia and it was clear, then a ultra sound to check for and kidney issues and that was clear. 
I have regular bloating and constipation followed by soft stool with a lot of mucus in it. It's almost fluffy at times.  No sign of blood or anything so far and I feel pretty good in general.  And I'm getting really bad lower back pain.
 My doctor decided because I was generally fine it must be ibs, I asked for a colonoscopy but she said there is no need and is going to do blood tests to check for celiac. 
My concern is I know a few people with ibs and one with crohns and they all describe the pain as a muscle cramp or spasm. My pain isn't anything like that there is no spasm and release it's just a constant uncomfortableness in the area described and it's constant like 24 hours a day constant. Not relieved by bathroom visits or anti spasmatics. If I bend or lean to the right it feels tend and as if something is there. 
Has as anybody else had this or have any idea what it could be? Or just advice as to what to do next? 
I'm a 26 yr old male. 
Thanks

"Im a 32 year old female and I have suffered from pain in upper left quadrant for about 4 years. When it first happened I had various tests, blood works, stool sample, camera down throat, ultrasound, ct scan all of which showed nothing and I ended up just being told to change my diet. After splitting from my sons father the pain disappeared for about a year so I put it down to being stress. Then after about a month of having my daughter by c-section it came back and been with me again for almost 2 years! It's not a horrific or constant pain but it's just there like a spasm that lasts a few seconds and occurs frequently. 
It sometimes radiates to my back but feels better if I push on that area and it rumbles almost like it could be trapped wind. That area is very noisy when I press on it and sometimes I can hear things slushing around if I push my tummy in and out in that spot! Sometimes I feel clogged up all way to my throat and feel like I need to burp, i get heartburn when bad too. Has ibs since I was a child and I'm generally quite constipated.
I have been a heavy drinker for about 10 years, probably having at least a bottle of wine most nights but have cut down lately as it seems worse the day after drinking. I've been paranoid about chronic pancreatitis but I would of thought I'd be in more pain as I'd only class the pain as about 2/3 on a scale of 10. I've looked up splenic flexure syndrome and my symptoms seem like it could be that. I have an appointment at hospital but not until October. Just want my mind put at rest that it's not my pancreas!! I have recently had another ultrasound done, blood works including lipase levels and stool sample. All normal.

"Last week I was told that my daughter has IBS, I was told that there's nothing they can do nor is there any advice on what she should or shouldn't eat, I asked if she would grow out of it and was told that they have no idea as they don't follow it up, I've bought a couple of books and read them but what one says you should do the other says you shouldn't, I guess there's no one better to ask than people who actually suffer from it so if anyone has any advice they could give me I'd be very grateful, thanks in advance.

However for the past 4 Months it has been dreadful, i've been on numerous medication including buscopan and amitiptyline but nothing has seemed to worked. I thought i could have a gluten intolerance or celica disease but i had a camera down me and a biopsy and nothing was picked up medically wrong.
I do suffer from anxiety because i worry about getting my IBS stomach cramps and worry what to do when i have them. i do also feel depressed but not just when i have the IBS pains. My anxiety isn't just when i have the pains either. I am currently having counselling but that hasn't helped that much and i have also had CBT. I just find it so hard to go and do things with the stomach pains because i'm also constantly worrying about them. It also makes it a lot harder to fit in with my friendss going out drinking and socialising because of the pains and the worry of feeling sick when i'm out and about
. Just wondering if anyone had any advice what i can do short term to ease the pain when i have it, and also some long term advice so i can start enjoying my life!

"Hi all
Am completely new to this forum and just looking for some advice. I have a query over IBS diagnosis at the moment awaiting further tests. It all started a few months ago when I started having severe acid reflux (agains still waiting for a diagnosis on that, awaiting endo and colonoscopy on same day - fun!!)
Anyway I guess my question is, can IBS cause you to have so many different types of stool and bowel habits? I mean lietrally in the last few months I have had every kind of stool going! From change in colour, yellow, brown, dark brown. Severe constipation, haven't been able to go for a week or so. Followed by severe diarreah, in fact it has been mostly diarreah. Sometimes with mucus, sometimes with undigested food. Have a few days where things settle down then right back to the change again. And the cramping I also get but not too bad, usually right before I go and feels like period cramps!
Just wondered if this is totally normal for IBS sufferers as I am so new to all of this. And I am so sorry for all the totally gross information I provided above!!!
Thank you, any help would be appreciated!

"Hi everyone,
Im a 21 yo female and have been living in absolute agony this past while. In Jan 2013 I became very sick and was going to the toilet 3-6 times a day with either  very black hard stools or very lose stools which lead my doctor to do tests on food allergies etc. I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy etc and no problems were found..great nothong scary! So naturally was labelled with Ibs which o accepted for about a year and triwd to manage the pain that was mainly around my ribs and abdomen.
Now the problem is that for the past six months this pain has evolved to include lower abdominal/pelvic pain that often radiates into my back and hips/thighs leaving it very difficult for me to stand straight and walking proves a dofficulty. Is this ibs related or something more? Ive had ultrasound and ovaries etc are all fine. Im just so sick of being sick now and want to get on with my life and now let this affect me as some days I get really down die to it. 
Any advice or help would be welcome.

"I suffered a bout of e-coli food poisoning two years ago..apart from the awful vomiting and other effects, my stomach became so swollen I was unable to fit into my usual clothes. My stomach remained like this for EIGHT weeks. After several trips to the doctors I was told that my intestines were 'traumatised' by the infection which was why they had swollen up. I suffered excruciating pain and uncomfortableness for three months in total. Ever since then I have had IBS. I am firmly convinced that my gut has become more sensitive and reacts accordingly to food that doesnt like me. I am sitting here now, at work, with my skirt button undone and my swollen stomach causing me immense pain..all because I had a bowl of porridge for breakfast. So another food to add to my list of 'Foods to Avoid'. The other side effect of IBS is the urgency to rush to the loo..which is so embarrasing whilst at work or out socially. When I think about it, my mum had exactly the same problems as me, and I often used to snigger when she said 'I like beetroot (for example) but it doesnt like me'. I am now that woman. My list includes white bread, pears, apples, any kind of root vegetables, porridge(!), muesli, pasta, cereal bars,cucumber, lettuce, tomatoes, it goes on and on. Im 40 now and so have had this for two years (was diagnosed after my e-coli episode). The tablets from the doctor don't really do anything, and in desperation, I have been known to have a huge slug of brandy. I so wish I could do something to stop this but until then, I will carry on glugging the brandy:cheers:

"Hi so I'm slightly embarrassed to this situation so here goes. For around 4-6 months I've been having stomach cramps and needing the toilet after meals and quite frequently feeling the need to go to toilet for a poo. Now it's been worse recently if I'm honest and I've booked an appointment to see my doctor. When I feel the need to go I barley pass anything one very small bit, Its always type 4 (Bristol stool chart) wise but when I go propley and empty my bowls it's between a 4/5. To give you a small brief on myself my diet is pretty poor I rarely eat veg or fruit and I'm missing A LOT of meals. I've always ate junk food and crisps however I've now started having three meals a day and I've cut the junk food out. I'm also having at least four of my give a day. The feeling is like I really need to go then nothing much happens. Ever since I've changed my diet my bowls have been better. The thing is I used to suffer with anxiety and depression and it's really making me upset and I'm thinking the worse of it all. I've only just turned 26 years old and I've been loving my life of recent I'm in the gym and going out with friends. One thing I did notice with my bowls in I've had one dose yesterday a good type 4 movement that was two tone in colour goldly brown and normal brown. After researching it that looks like I've eaten something or fatty foods? Lots of people have had it. Please can someone put my mind at ease I've asked people about this including a nurse and they think it's IBS. But I'm really getting upset over it all, I've also noticed releasing wind helps ease the stoumach cramps.

"Let me first explain that I am not medically qualified in any way, but, after reading some of the many posts on IBS, I would just like to make a few observations. My problem for several years has mainly been excess flatulence/gas and burping, and doctors insist on calling it a symptom of IBS. I notice many of you suffer from the same sort of thing, and, as in my case, the only help you get from your Doctor/Consultant is advice on how to alleviate the symptoms, when you really want them to deal with the cause.
If your car belches too much smoke from the exhaust because it is burning oil, you don’t alleviate the symptoms by starving the car of oil or petrol. You deal with the cause by replacing the piston rings! A crude analogy I know, but I’m sure you get the point?
So why are we reverting to diets like FODMAPS, or other partially effective medication and/or food supplements, when the real cause is almost certainly due to bacteria? I’ve been convinced of the need for an antibiotic to deal with excess gas since 2011 when, on more than one occasion, I was treated for an unrelated disorder, and the antibiotic, augmentin, completely cured the gas problem within a few days. And yes, my gas problem did return after I had been taken off the antibiotic, but of course my Doctor was not trying to treat that anyway.
Tests for SIBO proved negative, so my doctors refused to treat my excess gas with antibiotics as a matter of policy, claiming it would be inappropriate. ""Inappropriate"" to treat bacteria with antibiotics!?
I am glad to see that there is now some medical evidence (since 2012) to support the conclusion that bacteria is the main culprit, and I refer to work/research carried out by Mark Pimental, reported on the website MNT, Medical News Today, “Irritable Bowel Linked to Gut Bacteria, Definitely”.
Having said all that, why not pool our information by answering this with the following information:
1. Have you at any time experienced relief from IBS when prescribed antibiotics? (for whatever reason you were prescribed it)
2. How quickly did it take effect on the IBS?
3. Did the IBS eventually return?
or,
4. Did it completely cure your IBS?
5. What was the name of the antibiotic?

For the past year or so I have been experiencing what I thought to be bouts of a nervous stomach.
 When I got what I thought to be a nervous stomach I lost my appetite, felt ill, my bowel pattern was somewhat erratic and I had a feeling in my stomach like it was full acid( I know that there is acid in my stomach but I can’t think of another way to describe it) and I had a tight knotting feeling almost all the time . (I also had varying anxiety symptoms like fear and dizziness and I would have been fine with them if they didn’t come with the aforementioned physical symptoms). As well as this in a morning my symptoms seemed to be a lot worse and eating breakfast was a pain. I thought that what I was experiencing was a nervous stomach, the thought of which only increased my anxiety and made my symptoms worse. After a couple of months my symptoms somewhat subsided which I thought was the result of me overcoming my anxiety. Though the ‘main’ symptoms seemed to dissipate I was constantly scared that I was going to have another bout of nervous stomach and this time I would not be able to over come it and I would have to live with the symptoms constantly. I did have small bouts of the symptoms now and then but nothing as big and not for as long as it had been before. (Other things also persisted but I had no idea that these were symptoms). I really didn’t like this part of me ,I thought that it was all in my head and that when I got a nervous stomach it was my own fault ; I though I was the only one who could stop it and if I didn’t, it meant that I didn’t want it to stop (which is completely untrue ,obviously). I thought that it was my subconscious’ way of seeking attention (though I told no one but my mother), I thought that I was making myself have these symptoms and if distracted myself from them for long enough they would go. Though I found that distracting my self from my appetite loss did work quite often ,it didn't always work . When it didn't work or even when I found that I was worrying about it I told myself that I was being crazy and stupid and that it was all in my head, this all just made my anxiety worse when I had a bout which in turn increased my symptoms and it became like a viscous cycle.
 A couple of weeks ago another bout started but this time my previous ‘techniques’ weren’t working ; I couldn’t distract myself from it. For the past week or so I have been experiencing the symptoms which I had before but much worse I have also been sick in the morning and been feeling ill at night( pregnancy is not a possibility). Though I didn’t want to go to the doctors with a nervous stomach I thought that (with the being sick,the nausea, the appetite loss, feeling tired, having acute headaches and with the change in my bowel pattern )I might have a virus. My anxiety has also increased a lot this past week with ( or more precisely after )the increase in my  physical symptoms. 
 I had my appointment a couple of days ago and my doctor said that I do have a virus which he thinks I might have picked up abroad, he said  that it accounts for my being sick and feeling sick. He also said, as I’m sure you have surmised for you self, that he thought that I have IBS for which he has prescribed me medication.I have now realised that I have had many other symptoms that I didn’t recognise as symptoms such as (sorry to be disgusting) mucus, unexplainable stomach cramps and of course I now realise that what I thought was a nervous stomach was in fact my IBS flaring up which caused me to have anxiety which only worsened my IBS. I am still having a flare up at the moment but I am happy to call it a flare up as a pose me just being crazy. I still have this virus but I will just have to wait it out.
 I was wondering if there was anything that you could advice because I am a little unsure about where I go from here. For example ; do I need to ensure that I drink lots more water or would an increase in liquid consumption only worsen the flare up ? or is appetite loss actually a symptom or is actually  not and has always really just been in my head ?  I'm just confused about things really.
Sorry it's so long. I'm just sick of feeling like a lunatic and even though I know that I have IBS there is still that little thought that is telling me it is stil all in my head.

"Hey there, for around 3 months now I've been having problems with indigestion (burning feeling in my tummy after shortly after eating), heartburn and occasionally waking up in the middle of the night with acid in my throat.
I've been taking gaviscon to ease my discomfort and then I went to the doctors and I was put on omeprazole, but I had to come off that after a week because it gave me severe, painful constipation (and then I was given movicol to relieve me of that). I am now taking ranitidine twice a day which is working fine.
However, for the past month, maybe even longer I haven't had a normal bowel movement, even when I was off the meds for heartburn etc. They have been really loose, foul smelling and more frequent than before. I also have pains right before I need to go. I tried to explian these symptoms to my doctor but he just gave me the ranitidine for the heartburn/indigestion. 
I'm not sure if my problem with indigedstion and acid are linked to my bowel movements? I'm getting concerned and feel like maybe I should ask the doctor to look into this problem too? Does this sound like it could be IBS?

"Hello - I would really appreciate any help at all as I am so low and fed up. I understand there are people on here in a far worse state than me and I am grateful to some extent but I can't carry on much longer feeling so poorly.
I am a 44 year old female with no illness history (lucky me - although of course I didn't realise how lucky I was). About six months ago I had a few bad bouts of diarrhea and then everything changed. Every morning from 4am to 6am I am awoken with an urgent need to go to the bathroom and experience an explosion of loose stools and mucus (sometimes liquid but only every week-ish). I feel like I have been turned inside out and just feel really, really ill. I then get up and force myself to go for a walk (advised) and this does help as I am sick of the sight of my bathroom. I take two codeine (15mg) and sometimes need to go to the toilet a few more times before heading to work. 
Throughout the day (hoping noone will speak to me) I rarely need to go to the toilet again but feel like I could and I feel ill and have severe stomach pain. I am prescibed with Mebeverine which I am unsure helps or not. Once I get home I just need my bed.
I have been sent away by my consultant as 'only' having IBS after receiving every blood test available and a colonoscopy. My doctor is a little more understanding and sending me for some ovary scans as she is running out of ideas.
I have tried hypnotherpay; relexology; pro-biotics (really expensive ones); fibregel; anti-depressants; calcium tables and some food elimation.
Can it really be IBS if it occurs every day?
I am pretty sure it's not physcological as it wakes me up and it can happen on a Saturday morning when I have an easy day ahead as well as a Monday morning when I am concerned about getting to work.
I do worry a lot but have tried to remain as positive as I can, mainly for the sake of my husband and son and keeping my job. I do get very emotional and just want this to end as quickly as it came.
Can anyone help?

"Hi
Further to my last (and first) post, I just wanted to run something past the Forum and am asking for opinions (let's be honest, reassurance) it  if at all possible. The nature of this IBS-C seems slowly to be changing. 
Recently, I've tried a daily dose of flax seeds stirred into breakfast porridge and psyllium husks taken in water before the evening meal. For 3-4 days I seem to have limited bathroom 'activity'(an improvement from none) then I have about three BMs over the course of a single daytime, which is better than it was, but that evening, after I've eaten, painful flatulence and also belching after about 20 minutes. This persists on and off through the evening and turns offensive after a few hours. Eventually I think I want to go to the loo but it is generally wind and sometimes mucous too (sorry). By the time bedtime comes round (about 4 or more hours after eating) I have stomach discomfort and mild nausea. I end up reading until as late as 4am when the pain feels more like hunger and I fall asleep. The next day I feel as though my gut was kicked by a mule and I'm not sure whether to eat, take flax and psyllium or not.
Does anyone recognise this pattern of event with their IBS experience? What do/can I do about the non-constipation days? Eat/not eat, take supplements or not? I have been taking probiotics throughout. Any feedback would be most gratefully received. It would help if I could be reassured that this might just be an example of a 'typical' IBS experience, if such a thing exists! Thank you.
Cheers, Karen

"Hi I have IBS but also arthritis I can't really take ibuprofen and antibiotics cause IBS flare up as well.  I am now using ibuprofen gel, only helping a bit with the pain and so far so good no side effects.  My GP has also given me naproxin to be taken only if pain is very severe. She has also given me omprazole to protect stomach.  My question is has anyone with IBS any experience of this drug.  My Gp said it is a stronger pain killer but with similar side effects to ibuprofen.  I am frightened to take it as last year I reacted badly to codydramol as well  I can really only take paracetamol.  I have to wait now for referral to hospital.

"I have had a stressfull 18 months with family issues and harrassment.  In January this year while in USA I started getting cramps in my lower abdomin, thought it was something I ate, Upon reflection I ate a lot of wheat products and milk. On returning to UK  I went to see my doctors, test showed I had a trace of blood in my urine. After three months!!! I had to go to A&E myself in pain and they found I had a kidney stone, after shock wave treatment it dissapeared. But my cramps in my lower abdomin remained although they came and went very quickly. I had a mixture of constipation and loose stools.
One night I had a chinese meal and the next day was in so much pain in my lower abdomin, but it went after a day. Then I had some ice cream and the same thing happened. i started to change my diet and  I now juice one a day with vegetables and fruits and I have lost a stone in weight and am very particular now what I eat, and only eat when I feel hungry. The cramps had almost vanished. Yesterday I tucked into ice cream to see what happened, cramps again in lower abdomin, today I went for a Chinese meal and this evening I am in so much pain and it has spread from my lower back on my right hand side.  So it looks like no more Ice cream or chinese meals for me. I discussed this with my doctor and she gave me the FODMAP literature and told me to get on with it. I think I have IBS.

"Hi all,
I have suffered from IBS for 7 years.  I have found that stress does cause flare ups but some recently discovered food intolerances cause my worst bouts. I noticed there have been a lot of posts about IBS. So rather than repeat the same info. for every discussion that is started, here is my advice for everyone who suffers from IBS. 
Here are some things I have found help listed by symptom:
Constipation
For me, brown bread  only otherwise things just simply don't work.
Exercise can help keep things moving!!
Fibre
Fruits and veg. - however watch out for certain ones which may cause food intolerance reactions! 
Overflow.
If you don't get enough fibre on a long-term basis, you can get this. Which is quite embarrassing. Basically constipation causes a blockage of faeces in the gut. The blockage can cause nausea and acid reflux. Nausea occurs especially in the mornings. You can also get ""overflow"" stools then, a large stools that has built up that comes out at once.  
This should  first be confirmed  by a doctor if she has it or not. (can do via physical examination/X-ray)!!!!!
You can counteract this by trying taking psyllium husks or a bulking agent such as Fybogel for example, regularly for a certain period of time. And you should only use laxatives or bulking agents on advice of your doctor. Need to be careful with dosage!!!!!
Stomach pain
Peppermint oil, available in health food shops is great for stomach pain. I find it works wonders. You can apply it directly to skin or you can add it to hot water. You can also buy peppermint tea.
Nausea
I think ginger is supposed to be good for nausea. I found a ginger tea helped nausea but didn't have a lasting effect after I finished the tea. 
Prescription drug, buccastem is very good. You take it under the tongue and let it dissolve.
Food
Foods to avoid
Caffeine, alcohol, greasy/fatty foods. Spicy foods can be upsetting too. 
Intolerances
I also found out recently I was lactose intolerant (just from testing out not  taking it.) Lactose intolerance has different specific symptoms. More severe than just upset tummy from IBS - for me, I get nausea, belching and very bloated for up to an hour (lately more) until I get rid of all the gas (by basically pressing on my stomach or rubbing my chest or back like you would a baby with wind. Sometimes hunching down, bending at the waist and leaning my head forward helps or rubbing my hand upwards above my oesophagus to help the air get out or rubbing my hand in a fist gently but firmly around in a circle on my tummy and then raising it up along the oesophagus as described). 
You can get lactose-free milks or soy milk etc. as an alternative. And other alternatives eg. soy ice-cream and that. I have yet to investigate these options. 
Check out the Fodmaps diet - it lists foods you can be intolerant to. Some people will be more intolerant to one group than another - for me it's polyols and lactose that really set me off. It's a scary diet with lots of things to eliminate when starting off but keeping a food diary can help. Once you identify which group affects you, it is much easier to identify other trigger foods as you can just look at the group and say well I ate that thing belonging to that group, so that must affect me too. Also, being aware of which symptoms are food intolerant specific is key to helping identify food intolerances. Be aware that some foods will cause a near-immediate reaction that is more obvious, but some foods will take longer to cause a reaction! Watch out for anatto - a natural food dye. It is in Cheerios and other foods.

I'm afraid I can't really help with diarrhoea as it was never a major thing for me - but if this happens I would imagine just lowering fibre intake should help and drinking plenty of water to prevent dehydration.
Tests: 
An OGD/endoscopy/barium test can help check for haemhorrhoids/rule out Crohn's disease
Stool samples can be tested for infections
Hope all this helps! This is pretty much my 7 year's worth of knowledge on the topic!!

"Hi,
 I am new on here and am looking for advice or someone who has also had this.
 Right some general background, I am 22 year old female, university student, 5 foot 7, overweight, and I have always has problems with my stomach since I was a baby even. My granddad has IBS, and so does my mum. The doctor put me on buscopan originally, but changed it to Colofac about 4-5 years ago. I also have acid reflux, which I take omprezole for. I usually get stomach pains and an urgent need to have a poo especially in the morning. It’s not usually diarrhea (it has been though in the past), its usually soft & messy but not runny/watery.  Also I get a yellow substance from my anus. When I wipe, there is the poo and around it is a yellow substance. About 4 months ago, the doctors changed the colofac (once a day) to Mebeverine (once a day). Since I’ve been on these it hasn’t got any better I would say it may have got a touch worse.
 I have also had problems with periods (my mum also has problems with hers but hers were more regular than mine, but still irregular for years).  I have my first period at about 13 or 14, it came for about 5 days one month, then the next month again the same, but after that it didn’t come back for about another year, where it came for about 5 days and went again for over year. Sometimes I find it starts when I do exercise etc.  It’s gone on like this until March this year. I did go to the doctors I think when I was about 18, he did a blood test (I think for hormones), and it was fine, and that was all I heard about it. In March, it came for 5 days, and then in April. Then I start spotting on about the 8th day before the next was due in June. In June it lasted for a whole month (varying from light to moderate). It stopped at the start of July. Then on the 15th I started spotting again, for a day or two, then the day after it was the tiniest amount. This time I got lower abdomen pain; off center to the right (it felt like pressure). The blood was brown coloured. Sometimes when my periods actually due I get it normal colour other days its brown. I was getting worried so on Friday I went to the doctors to ask about my IBS and Periods. I couldn’t see a doctor so had to see an Advanced Nurse Practitioner, who said that the problems with my periods spotting etc could be because of stress. I told her about the problems with sometimes when I do exercise it starts, she thought it could be an irritation with my cervix, she did a smear test (first one), but she said that my cervix looked fine. She said she would refer me to a gynecologist for ‘advice’, and for an ultrasound.
 I asked her about my IBS, and she told me to stop taking the Mebeverine, and try Fibergel. Which I did and on Saturday and today I have more and more pains in my lower abdomen (center-ish, and left side), slight pressure pain in my groin and very tops of my legs, and pain in my stomach (about 3 inches below breasts). I have also found that I get a slight pain before peeing and a very very slight burning sensation. I feel I need to pee slighty more. I woke up this morning with a horrible taste in my throat and a very dry mouth. I didn’t take the fibergel today and haven’t taken the Mebeverine. It doesn’t hurt all the time, but the pain generally lasts for a few seconds, but my whole abdomen feels a bit uncomfortable, even cloths sitting on it makes it feel odd. I also have noticed that I am a burping a lot more but not farting.
 I am a worrier and am really worrying about this, I have read that IBS symptoms have been mistaken for different cancers; I am worried that this is the case. I am a virgin, how likely is it to get some of these cancers? 
I was wondering if anyone had had this before. I have been under a lot of stress recently, what with university and my dog is really ill. My mum thinks it’s the stress and because I am worrying it seems to be getting worse.
I was wondering if both are separate or both due to stress or something worse.  Could it a reaction from the smear test etc?
I was just wondering if anyone could help, because I cant help but worry.
 Sorry about the all the writing. I know Its only been a few days but I would to know if other people have had this. 
Thanks.

"Hi, this is my first post here. I've been trying to figure out what is going on with me. I'm very upset. It all started about 2 1/2 months ago when I made a big change to my diet. On the advice of an osteopath, I started an autoimmune diet. I won't go into what that entailed but suffice it to say it was a big change from what I was use to. My stomach became so upset that I could barely eat anything without it hurting and I became constipated. Once or twice I had a diarrhea attack right after I ate something my system didn't like. I also had this uncomfortable, pressure like feeling in my lower bowel or rectum. I stopped the diet after about a week and in about a month, my stomach returned to normal but not my bowel. I still feel constipated and I have the constant rectal discomfort. It feels achy, sort of like something is putting pressure on a sore or tender spot. I feel like having a BM would help but it really doesn't. I'm taking fiber and laxatives but I can't get my bowels regulated or the consistency right. I often don't feel like I've completely done my business. I'm from the US so I hope you get my meaning. The only thing I know to do to try to relieve the sense of pressure and discomfort is to try to go to the bathroom. this may give a little relief but doesn't stop the bad sensation I have.
When things didn't clear up, I started to wonder if my problem could be from pelvic floor prolapse since I had my ovaries removed last year. I went to a urogynocologist and was diagnosed with a grade 2 rectocele and mild prolapse of the bladder which is being treated with a pessary, kegels, and estrogen cream. So far, this isn't helping.
I'd love to know if anyone has a clue as to what's going on. I just recently had a colonoscopy and that was fine. Thank you for reading this post and your help.

"Nearly a year ago I was quite healthy and then out of the blue I suddenly had a terrible pain in my stomach / abdomen which went on and on after eating some raw cloves of garlic. The doctor insisted I had ulcers and gafve me ppis. They helped. From this he deduced he had got it right.
After months it went and I stopped taking them. Then one day I had some probiotic capsules and the following day BAM that terrible stomach was there again and in absolute agony for over a month. The doctor said oh dear you must have a hiatus hernia. I pointed out to her that I also found my ears got blocked, and headaches, stuffed nose and it seemed more like acid reflux to me. She ignored me. I was sent for an endoscopy which I had today. The doctor who did it asked me about my symptoms and ignored everything I said except for the bit about the stomach aches.
She then said there was no hernia or ulcer etc so it it is probably gallstones. Gallstones do not give you headaches, blocked ears, blocked runny nose! Nor do they suddenly come on after taking some biotic capsules!
Why don't they listen properly?

"My story is quite long and now becoming a huge issue in my life! 
About 3 years ago I went to the doctors complaining of stomach pains and finding it hard to lose weight, I am only a size 10/12 but I have now become extremely conscious. The doctor just told me to cut out on unhealthy food (which I am sure you will agree, most people do this if they want to lose weight) this made me feel extremely stupid and I started really doubting myself.
About a year later I still had these pains and they were becoming worse and worse, I would sit around friend houses and would have hot flushes and completely bloat. This is when friends and family became really concerned. I then decided to see another doctor and they just referred me back to this website to look on info about IBS and to cut out wheat. I started to do this but my symptoms carried on, having good and bad days. 
The 3rd time I went back, I asked to be referred, which they did. I had blood tests, ultrasound, biopsy, a stool sample and endoscopy. But nothing abnormal came back and they told me I have IBS and left me to it.
A further year went on and the pain is worse/ still there. I started becoming really tired and having no energy and I started to starve myself on weekends, not because I wanted to lose weight but because I didn't know what I could or couldn't eat. I decided to go back to the doctor and they told me they have done everything and think it is severe IBS.
I am now becoming very depressed as there is nothing I can eat! I really don't feel that it is just IBS and I am not sure what to do as it is so tough living with this. My partner is becoming increasingly worried as I am becoming more and more upset.
I have decided to change my doctor but have not yet have confirmation and I am losing faith of doctors as they make me feel like it something easy to deal with but it is not!  
I now don't like looking at myself as I feel huge because of my constant bloating... I am cutting more and more foods out but it still doesn't help. It is also affecting my social life as anything I eat/ drink bloats me out and makes my stomach feel really unsettled. I really do not know what to do and I don't know if I can go on if this is what I have to deal with for the rest of my life. As I said I am about 90% sure it is not just IBS, please can someone help me as I am at the end of my tether and I as time goes on I am becoming more and more self conscious and more and more depressed about this! Please help me I am desperate!!!! Thank you!!

"Hi people, I'm new to this site and would like some help with making people aware of what could happen if you ignore simple problems like abscesses. I'm 31 with a colostomy and intermittent catheter. shortly I will be having my 29th operation for a super pubic catheter put in place and then another operation for hernia and the stoma to be pushed back as its sticking out.
it all started from 1 perianal abscess and that turned into many abscesses and fistulas, one fistula was found in the middle of the muscle and when operated on it caused me to become incontinent and needed a colostomy. since then I have had further surgery and more damage was done to my pelvic nerves which is why I have a catheter in.
recently I had eurodynamic testing and results were bad, urology have now decided that I need super pubic catheter and a stimulator box putting in my backside. they have said that they are sure it won't help but worth a go. so far they haven't found what might have caused all of this to happen as I don't have IBS, crohns or any medical condition at all. they say I'm the 1 out of 10 that just cannot be sorted.
like I said before I would like to make a page that when people read it they realise how difficult it can be coping with colorectal and urology conditions, how it effects people and the day to day life's, confidence etc. people do look and laugh at people with colostomy bags and leg bags, but I have stayed strong and tryed to get on with things.
would anyone be able to help or offer me any advice?
many thanks Richard

I'd say normal amount but enough to require approx. 10min just to clean. Everything is normal I'm just looking for any tips to reduce amount of residue.
In all my life I only remember twice that I made it absolutely perfect, you could barely need to clean.
Could a certain mixture of food in a particular order just happen to create it perfect? In other words: Are there food that combine well together to create it perfect?

every 3/4 days I seem to get really painful stomach aches And need to rush to the toilet due to diarrhoea. this can happen up to 3 times a night until the stomach aches finally disappear. Some months can go by and I wont get any problems but some weeks it happens a lot. 
The pain can change a lot, during the day time I can feel my stomach almost starting the process( this may sound stupid) , it makes a lot of noises and I have to pass wind a lot. Then in the evenings it will start to get worse until I need to go to the toilet.

"Could anyone suggest the next steps for me? I have suffered with IBS for almost 10 years now. I am mid-thirtys and I find that my symptoms are having quite a severe impact on my life. Main symptom is urgency to go to the bathroom. So with little or no notice I might find myself needing the toilet and the inconvenience of this is really affecting me. Have tried many many things including food intolerance testing (dairy is an issue for me), acupuncture, hypnotherapy, acidophilus, extra strength Vit B complex, fibogel sachets, mebevorine. Frequency used to also be an issue and liquid/soft stool but these 2 symptoms have been rectified since starting Amytryptilline about 7 months ago. However, still the urgency remains. Two weeks ago, my doctor prescribed Buscopan to be taken as well. Still, I dont think this is solving the problem. All blood work I had done was normal, I'm not coeliac and inflammatory markers were normal. My question mainly is should i now try Prevalite or go down the route of investigating for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and try treatment with Rifaximin, glutamine and probiotics to promote gut healing?? Any advice appreciated.

"2 weeks ago I tried starting a strict gluten free diet following possibilities of coeliac disease or sensitivity to gluten. I expected my bowels to improve following a 6-8 week diary I had been keeping i regulated my intake of food and drink to give myself a 'reference' to begin with.
So I was generally ok, slightly bloated prior to gluten free. 3 days into gluten free I felt awful. Stomach pains, diahrrea really smelly gas, felt weak, headaches etc. Struggled to concentrate at work. My intake of fruit and veg increased and this period of feeling crap lasted 3 days. I was bad. I felt awful. Anyway things improved slightly and the diahhrea calmed but the stomach noises, pains etx were still present.
I'm just confused? If I drink beer, eat pizza, eat pasta...etc usually it irritates me. This week (after being gluten free for 2 weeks and feeling bad) I've sacked the gluten free diet, had bread, pizza etc...but just watched my sugar intake (as this is a sensitivity for me) and I'm having relatively normal bowel movements, no headache, no morning rushes...slightly constipated.
Not sure where to go from here? I seem to be going in this cycle where I will be ok for about a month, then have a proper bad spell usually 2 days of diahrrea, aches, headaches, brain fog etc...then back to normal. I've kept a diary of everything I've been eating and can't link anything to my causes. The 1 thing I thought would help...staying off gluten...actually seems to make things worse?

"Hi I'm Jules
I wonder if someone could help? I started to suffer severe bloating at the end of Feb this year and visited a GP who told me I was lacking 'friendly' bacteria in the gut and suggested 'Yakult.' It did indeed reduce the most severe bloating but soon after I realised that the bloating wasn't going away. In addition other symptoms include mild upper abdomen (stomach) pain and nausea. This nausea is worse when I haven't eaten. I also feel more tired than usual. 
My my appetite hasn't suffered and I haven't lost weight. I have been on Lanzaprazole and Colofac which didn't do anything. Now I'm on Colpermin 
(For a few dates only so far - maybe 4) and it's making me feel 'weird' - slightly anxious, tingly and the nausea seems worse. Really I have no idea whether this is Colpermin to blame for this. 
I suffered some serious sneezing bouts & runny nose but not constant - I wonder whether I'm wheat / gluten intolerant. Am trying now to cut both out of my diet. I have found it quite difficult though - I had no idea how much wheat features in general food stuffs. 
If I'm honest I'm not sure really what I'm asking here. I think I'd like to know from those with IBS if you think I do have it... Truthfully I'm not sure what to do. I feel terrible most days and it's bringing me down and freaking me out a bit. 
I'm awaiting blood, stool and ultrasound test results / dates at the moment. I just hope it's nothing more serious.  ;(

"Hi all, 
I wrote on here a while back about some very strange symptoms that came on when i found out i was pregnant. Light sensitivity, and a drunk/high feeling that would come and go. I then miscarried, and for 3 weeks felt fine. Then one day, i woke up with the drunk feeling constantly, and the light sensitivity, and have been this way for 5 months straight, with no break in symptoms. I saw a gastro in February who found yeast overgrowth in my stool. I thought nothing of it, i didn't even know what it was, until i started researching. He gave me nystatin, and my symptoms never changed. Started researching yeast, and was certain it was causing my issues. I went on a strict diet, and found a doctor who deals with these types of issues seems i read a lot about regular doctors who don't believe in it. She put me on nystatin/diflucan for a month, and i had no relief in symptoms. Things i have tested for: 
Thyroid-Fine 
Diabetes-Negative 
General blood testing- Ok (But few neutrophils that fight bacteria 2 points out of range), overall white blood count within range 
CT head scan-Normal 
Food allergy testing shows no allergies 
Probiotics tried (None make any difference) 
Doctor has tried (Metronidazole as it can help fight certain bacteria in the body)- Makes symptoms 10x worse 
Nystatin and diflucan make symptoms feel 10x worse 
GP a while ago said i had a sinus infection (I don't think she knew what was wrong really, she just went off me saying i had some post nasal drip and my nose runs a bit), so she gave me ceftin- This also made my symptoms feel 10x worse. 
So i am not sure if any antibiotic is making me feel worse, or these certain ones irritate whatever i have going on. So i just did the CDSA stool analysis that i heard really helps show up yeast, and what is resistant/sensitive to it. I just got the results, and it shows no yeast present in my stool, and this test took 3 different samples from different days. Now i am completely disheartened because i have no idea why i feel this way, and it is really scaring me. Does anyone know other things that can cause these issues? I will give a quick run down of symptoms. 
Constant drunk/high feeling 
Light sensitivity (Not so bad outside in natural light, much worse with indoor lighting) It feels like when you first wake up and turn a lamp on, but my eyes never adjust to the light. 
Undigested food in stools 
Hard pellet stools 
Carbs/Sugar/Caffeine make symptoms worse 
Random itching over skin but with no rash (Sometimes mild hives are present) 
Heavy feeling eyes/Sometimes feel very sleepy after food 
Feel at best first thing in the morning 
Sneezing sometimes/runny nose 
Post nasal drip sometimes 
Itchy anus/inside ears/nose 
Slight runny nose sometimes 
Had chronic constipation before this for 2 months 
Had root canal-Had tooth removed, made no difference 
I am at my wits end, and i worry i have something really rare and life threatening.

"I have suffered IBS for as long as I can remember (I'm 31 now), the main symptoms being severe wind and diorreaha. As other people have stated, I also suffer the left side pain (particularly after exercise). If under immediate stress or upset, I find an instant urge to go to the toilet, this in itself leading to anxiety and panic attacks, this making the urge worse, etc etc etc... I have also noted tiredness, mood swings and depression, and been recently diagnosed with depression by my GP. Until reading the dialogue here today I did not realise that the tiredness and depression could in fact be linked to the IBS. Hopefully this will help when I next visit my GP as this gives greater impetus to getting him to refer me for blood tests etc in relation to the IBS.
All in all, I have to state, the condition is depressive and life consuming, taking over not only my life but that of my family too (who are now rather de-sensitised to the problems because they hear about them everyday!). It's useful to get this off my chest in an understanding forum. :roll:

"I recently have had a baby (17weeks post partum) throught my pregnancy and now after I have been suffering with frequent bouts of severe stomach cramping and diarrhea. The cramps start like a pressure in my lower abdomon, hips and back. It feels like a balloon and I am going to explode. The diarrhea usually follows an hour or 2 later and lasts for around 2 hours. Afterwards I am left with a stabbing intense pain in my lower abdomon almost groin area untill I eventually fall asleep and wake up ok (it's mostly always at night) I can't find any triggers to the problem, I've not noticed it better or worse after eating certain foods, to me it seems very random. I have had this 1-2 times a week now for around 6-7 months.. I am going to make an appointment with the doctor as no sleep and extreme pains do not mix with a young baby. I just didn't want the doctor to write it off and wondered if my pregnancy could have triggered some kind of bowel or intend time problem.. Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated.

"I have been house bound for several months now with diarrhea, sometimes its barely anything, but still feel the need to go immediately . i'm depressed and sick of this kind of life (if you call this a life) i'm afraid to go anywhere and when i do i'm scared of what might happen, and it usually does happen. its hard to explain to people because its something i don't want to talk about.....my doctor says learn to live with it, there is nothing out that can help. In a colonoscopy they found ulcers in my colon...doctor gave me antacids (prescription) for 3 months and now going tomorrow to get a endoscopy to see if the ulcers are still there, i told him i have to take imodium ad just to get to his office.

"I've had intermittent pain under my right rib for a number of years which had an unknown cause. Also recently had my gallbladder removed but still appear to have the same problem. This is particularly painful during the day and I can feel a sore 'spot' when I press. The pain is like someone is scraping my insides with a razor blade and can be excruciating on times. I've also had bouts of d and c over the years. I'm now back on the round of more tests and scans but the doc has mentioned ibs. Do any sufferers have this type of pain and if so what helps to alleviate it?
Any advice would be appreciated!

"I've been having pressure in my pelvis which changes from the front (feels like uterus) to the back (bowels) and is only relieved when I go to the bathroom, but then the pressure feeling sometimes comes back a few hours later. It's a very light feeling and I keep getting light period pains (which I don't usually get) and when I go to the toilet, it's fine, but I'm really struggling to pass gas and then it's giving my stomach aches if I can't. I've also had some yellow discharge. My Doctor felt my stomach and said she can't feel anything wrong and it's most likely caused by my IBS. I also had a shooting pain from my belly button to my crotch (which I have felt before) but it's making me really worried.
I've had IBS for a very long time and suffered from horrible things because of it, but I've never had this feeling before. Do you think it could be caused by IBS? It's been about 1 week since it started and I can't get back to my Dr until Monday.

"This time last year i was admitted to hospital with a perforated bowel. Following numerous tests i was furtherly told i had IBS. Not having a bowel problem before i thought it wouldnt affect me. Now it is. I used to have 3 bowel movements a day which was completely normal for me.
Now i am not regular and very rarely feel i am 'emptying' properly - feeling i need to go back to the toilet but nothing happens. I get pain in my Left illiac fossa going into my groin and occasionaly goes to the right side too but higher up in my abdomen. Ill take a laxative but im quite clearly very sensitive to them at times sending me one way or the other.
ive tried changing my diet but i dont even know what im suposed to do because im unsure what it is that is actively making me feel like this.
Ive also been suffering from anxiety recently and now im feeling better im starting to think - is it becasue now im not anxious my focus is on something else being my bowel.
This is really getting me down and im not sure how i can cope with it, im currently taking colpermin but i dont even know if its helping or not. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thankyou very much.

"Hi there. I`ve suffered from ibs for years. To start with, it was just periodically, but now there`s no let up. Had barium meals, tests for coeliac diseae, ovarian cancer - all ok thank goodness. Don`t find any particular food makes it worse. Have tried Spasmonal, Colofac, Colpermin, Fybogel. Out of those Colofac appears to work best
However, last few months, I am continually bloated. Mainly in stomach itself eg part immediately under ribs and going up into ribs. Sometimes over bowel area too. Each time i eat/drink, i feel even more enormous than before. The bloated/full feeling never goes down. SO uncomfortable. Any ideas anyone? Thanks x

"I recently had a camera endoscopy as recommended by my gastroenterologist.  He was a bit slow to call me about the results, so I called my primary doc.  His secretary read me the radiologists report: ""lymphangiectasias throughout small bowel, otherwise normal.""
The next day my gastroenterologist finally did call me about the procedure, and left a message saying that the test came out fine, and everything is ok.
So, here is the question: Are lymphangiectasias harmless? Or should I assume that my gastroenterologist mis-read something?
( BTW, please don't assume that I have IBS just because I am posting in this forum.  I don't have a formal diagnosis yet.  )

"Hello,
I have recently been diagnosed with IBS. I have had testing for Chrones and Coeliac's but I am currently on a gluten free diet.
I am still trying to work out what affects me - peanuts are a complete no no and tomatoes (which is a problem because I love bolognese).
I am going for allergy testing for dairy soon - I really hope it's not that!!
Is it common for a person with IBS to be on a gluten free diet? All this change is stressing me out a bit, which doesn't help the IBS!
I would be grateful for any tips to help me with this new lifestyle change, thank you.

"Hi guys, I'll start off by saying I'm 18, overweight, suffer from anxiety and asthma.
 About 2 and a half months a go, I suffered from a bout of food poisoning, I think it came from some chicken or possible a kebab I ate on the day. Anyway, for the next 1 and a half weeks I suffered from diarrhea ( normally 2-3 times a day, normally first thing in the morning) stomach pain/ cramps and the occasional rectal pain (well it was a weird sort of stabbing pain, mainly when I was lying down). After this food poisoning, I recovered and went back to having normal bowel movements and solid stools. Now, about a month ago, I started having stomach pains, cramps and I have diarrhea again. With the diarrhea, I normally need it shortly after I wake up, I get a pain in my stomach notifying me that I need to relieve my bowels, and of course with it being diarrhea it's loose stools. But another thing I have noticed is that both my ribs have started hurting, it's hard to describe it but it's not a nice feeling. Also, the left rib hurts to touch, near the bottom of the rib, it feels like I have bruised it or something as when I press down it hurts, and a bit further I also have some pain, also hurts to touch it there. I noticed that when I do empty my bowels, the pain does slightly ease up but then returns later and also when I eat (I do eat quite a lot in a day, mainly fast food and fried foods and sweet stuff etc) the pain comes back a bit as my stomach is full. As far as I am aware, there's no blood in my stools, it's just normally quite runny, loose and brown and I haven't suffered from any weight loss as of yet. I am genuinely really worried because I always have the feeling that I may have bowel cancer, and because I suffer from anxiety, the pain gets ever more worse when I start thinking about it and worry. I haven't had the chance to see the doctors yet but I am definitely going to make an appointment soon. What do you think I could possibly have?Thanks people.

"Hi there, first time poster but I'm just looking for some advice/reassurance. I'm a 20 year old male and pretty physically active - I play football and baseball weekly and go swimming at least twice a week. My diet isn't spectacular; I'm a student so my food budget isn't that good, but I tend to have a very mixed diet, with a fair few vegetables and fruits but also a decent number of kebabs/pizzas etc.
I've always had slightly inconsistent bowels and bowel movements, sometimes having large, solid stools but having diarrhea occasionally as well. Never any blood, no mucus or anything, and it's been like that for as long as I can remember. Maybe that's even normal, I'm not sure. I also had occasional bouts of constipation which lasted a few days at most.
About 4 weeks ago, I developed severe constipation, worse than I'd ever had in my life. For 3 straight weeks, I didn't have a single 'decent' bowel movement. I would sit on the toilet for perhaps half an hour at a time, only managing to squeeze through a tiny bit of diarrhea or thin stool. I even tried sitting in different positions, including with my legs up, to try and assist the bowels. My diet hadn't changed particularly in the lead up to this change in bowel movements, though I had started focusing on my university coursework and exam revision.
After these 3 weeks, I went on holiday to Spain with my family. During the 10 days I was there, I developed more regular meal times (as a student living on my own, I often stayed up to late hours such as 4am and beyond) and sleeping times but although the constipation eased up slightly, it still greatly persisted.
I bought a bag of prunes and ate several each day and the constipation largely disappeared, though the stool was often diarrhea and had little form (sausage shape like usual). Nonetheless, it allowed me to empty my bowels and feel better. After not eating the prunes for a couple of days however, I noticed the constipation began to return and I found myself straining again when using the toilet.
I'm now home from Spain and terrified that this constipation/diarrhea cycle is something serious. I have little abdominal pain - only the usual when I've not had a bowel movement for a lengthy period of time, and few other symptoms. I find if I haven't had a bowel movement for a long time my appetite decreases due to the bloating feeling. I've always been anemic to a degree due to a rare, non-dangerous blood condition I have, but have not noticed any increased weakness, dizziness or loss of motor functions. I have also THOROUGHLY checked my stools for signs of blood (both dark and fresh) and have not found anything more than a few spots on the tissue paper after straining for a long time. The stool, when passed, is a fresh brown colour most of the time.
I'm scared however that this could be something very serious, but was wondering if this could be a case of IBS? I'm not a regular smoker or drinker (socially at most) and there is no family history of colon cancer as far as I'm aware of.
Any help, advice or reassurance would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.

"Hi everyone I am a 19 y old girl I have always suffered with gastro related issues and I was diagnosed with ibs about three years ago. However, it has gotten progressively worse. I have been prescribed things such as mebeverine and I regularly take medicines such as colpermin and gaviscon but they rarely take any effect. To be honest I am nearly at the end of my tether. The pain I get with this condition is ruining my life. I try to single out foods which trigger but I can't work out any sort of a pattern. Sometimes I will have weeks worth of agonising pain accompanied with bouts of constipation or diarrhoea or other times I will be symptomless. I had a sigmoidoscopy last month as a result of rectal bleeding but they didn't find any thing apart from some polyps. The doctor told me to eat more fibre but I don't think it is doing me any good. This week I have been eating loads of veg and fruit, no bread or pasta cos hat always flares me up. But yesterday all of a sudden I had this absolutely agonising pain come up in my stomach. It was probably the worst attack I've ever had. I couldn't even walk and as I was in public I had to lock myself in a toilet for an hour to try and ease the pain. However this did not help and I ended up getting on the wrong bus just so I could sit down. It was just crippling. In the end I got off the bus and went down a road hoping there would be somewhere I could lie down (I know it sounds ridiculous) and I ended up sitting down in the park. I called 111 cos I didn't know what to do and I was just sat there crying my eyes out in crippling pain. Then some passers by ended up calling an ambulance for me despite my protesting.
When the ambulance got to me I could tell they weren't going to take me seriously because I wasn't vomiting etc, but I was in such agonising pain. It was so embarrassing cos I knew they weren't taking me seriously. In the end they just dropped me off at the train station to go home. Needless to say it was the worst journey I've ever had to do. For the life of me I cannot work out what triggered the attack. I'd eaten fruit for breakfast and drank water. I can't emphasize the pain enough. I know I need to see my doctor but I hate being fobbed off and I find it really hard when someone doesn't take me seriously. This condition is ruining my life I have missed so much both in my personal and work life cos of it. I just wanted to get this off my chest and I just wondered if anyone else could relate to it or had any tips. Please don't dismiss me!! Haha.

"Hi, after 4 bouts of severe stomach pains that come on with no warning and usually early hours of the morning, I've been diagnosed today with IBS. Originally I was sent down the gynae route but all showed clear. I had in the space of 4 months 3 times with the severe pain then nothing for 4 months, then just had again Tuesday. But I don't ever have problems with my toilet which I thought having to rush to do 'the other' was a definite symptom of IBS which I'm regular and normal, but all of a sudden got this severe pain in my abdominal, it lasts for a few days and I can barely walk with it, lose my appetite, get hot and cold sweats and top of legs achy. Then as the pain subsides it is more on my right. Is this what others experience ever? Is the pain so severe you can barely stand up straight and does anyone have IBS with no pooing incidences?

"Had campylobacter infection about 20 years ago, was mis-treated with wrong antibiotics. Suffered for years, then had some quieter times. Now have a long flare-up, probably caused by the endless stress of the last two years.
Question is: what can I do / take to continue my running?
running is my only good time of day, I don't want to have to quit. but there are no bathrooms for sudden stops. Can I stop the cramping that will sooner or later result in a bowel movement? No, I don't get diarrhea, but when I have to go I have to go. I can't ask these questions anywhere.

"I've suffered from IBS for about ten years (although not knowly).
Caffine - I've cut it out completly. I had one glass of pepsi last month and within half an hour i was on the loo for 45 mins
Fibre - I enjoy bread/ceral but can only have white bread as any fibre just get me running to the loo. (I'm even making my own bread to cut out the additives)
Fruit/Veg - I used to be able to eat fruit when i younger and loved it but at the moment i can only eat potatoes(even these seem to cause problems.)
I've been to the doc and have tried Spasmonal (Really didn't do anything for me), Colpermin(pepermint oil caps but again no real improvement. Im now using Amitriptyline(2 tab per day) and Loperamide (When needed which is 2-3 times a week.)
The amitriptyline does seem to reduce the spasms, but there are side effects. For me excess sweating is caused which isn't great when i've already got a stammer and severe IBS and i wonder why i'm single :-)
I've now be refered to the hospital for a Colonoscopy(Joy), i've also had blood tests for glutin and all the normal possible probs.
Stress - this is one that i do know does affects me, as i have a stammer i'm always worried about my next sentence, work stress isn't helping ether.
My main probs are, loose stools (To the point where i carry moist toilet paper wipes everywhere i go), Cramps caused by the diarrhea, and generally feeling run down due to the IBS.
As i type this i'm sitting with a heat pad on my lower ab, If anyone can suggest something that i haven't tried as the IBS is getting worse.

"Hi guys, I'll start off by telling you I'm an 18 year old male, overweight, I have asthma and suffer from anxiety. About a month or so ago, I had diarrhoea which I think I got from eating spicy food that day. Anyway, with the diarrhoea, I started suffering from stomach pains, I can't really describe what they were like but they were quite painful and at times sharp. I also had rectal pains, whilst lying down but this was occasionally and I also sometimes had a sharp stabbing pain in my ribs, a few times it was pain underneath the ribs but this didn't happen very often. I would do diarrhea about twice or three times a day, it was quite runny. This happened for about two weeks then I was ok. Now, a couple of weeks on, I'm having these pains again, it started a few days ago, whilst I don't have diarrhea now, I still go to the toilet normally once a day. Sometimes my stools are painless but today I was really struggle to empty my bowel, it was quite painful and the stomach pain was quite bad, but it has eased up now slightly. I do eat quite a lot, I don't drink that much water and I do get about 45 minutes - 1 hour of exercise most days. Oh, I also sometimes get a burning type pain after masturbating (which I do twice a day) and sometimes after urinating. I get really scared which makes my anxiety slightly worse. Am I suffering from something like IBS or do I have bowel cancer (which has made me feel really worried these past couple of days)? Thanks guys.

"Hi. I was told by my doctor I had IBS in July last year. My symptoms of mainly diarrhea started as my mum was passing away with cancer. At that time, I was having diarrhea after most meals, cramping before having the diarrhea and the diarrhea was very mucusy. No blood or weight loss. My doctor said it was classic IBS and no tests were needed. The diarrhea continued but around Christmas became much less, I even had some normal stools (even hard!) with diarrhea only once a week or less. Now during the last couple of weeks I have been having very loose stools every morning, usually just the once and then I don't go again til the next morning (loose and mucusy, so soft that I cannot feel it but not diarrhea, small pieces that break up). What I want to ask is do I need to go back to the doctor or is this just how IBS works? I am worried that the doctor has missed something, however, with the improvement of symptoms for 3 months I would assume this is unlikely? Thoughts please.

"Hi,
I'm new here and just got back from the hospital after giving a number 2 sample.
I am a worrier and found this forum so thought I'd post if that's ok for some advice.
Basically over the last 9 months I have had bouts of diarrhea that have lasted for a week, only ever in the morning after getting up. I have always checked for blood but so far never seen any.
The same happened again last week (this is about the 4th time) but this time i have had permanent tummy ache and feel sick with it. The tummy ache has a few sharp random pains thrown in too and can be in my back or abdomen or shoulder blades but mostly my stomach.
I have had two other times when I have felt sick and stomach ache in the last few months but I attributed this to a bug.
I am on opremazole for acid indigestion too which I have been on for a couple of years off and on.
I have not lost any weight but it's only the last two days I haven't felt like eating. I am also overweight which could be a factor?
Anyone else had these symptoms? Any replies gratefully received.
Thanks.

Wondering if anyone could provide me with some advise here.
I have had a upset stomach for three weeks now, my chest and head feels hotter than normal
My stools are watery, sometimes green mucusy
Everytime I eat I feel like I'm going to be sick, but it's just a feeling
I've lost almost half stone in weight
Feeling weak and always tired, even thou I hardly get out of bed.
I've even got a sore throat, I can swallow food, just have to keep on clearing out my throat.
Doctors have done blood test and they have come back all clear
Yesterday I went to the out of hours surgery, the Dr there prescribed me omeprazole. Today is no better, but I'm going to give the tablets a few days, see if I improve.
As it's been so long, I just don't know what to do. Any help, advise, things to try would be greatly appreciated. Starting to panic and worry now as generally I thought I was in good health.

"Hello,
First thing, I am new on this forum, and of course I don't expect a diagnosis or anything, but just some good advice that could help.
To explain my situation, I didn't have any health problems whatsoever until 2 years ago. I suddenly got some food poisoning or gastroenteritis, and after being really sick for a night, i was better.
But a few days later, it got some really bad stomach bloating and general weakness. A blood test showed transaminases being too high (twice the normal level). After two months it was all ok.
But a few months later, it went back, and now I have been ill for 2 years. My symptoms have been the following ones:
- Bloating, especially in the morning and after meals.
- nausea
- eczema which extended dramatically at some point.
- I feel always tired and weak
- hair loss
- acid reflux sometimes
- sleeping troubles
- At some point, I got some food sensitivity (dairy, gluten).
I have seen two specialists and of course my GP and had a lot of tests, showing nothing wrong. I took a lot of medications, and anti-acids made me even more sick, in the end only the amitriptyline helped a little.
I tried probiotics, and again not really better. After reading a lot about candida, I tried natural anti-fungals and also fluconazole, and again it didn't help at all.
My problem is now that doctors just say it is IBS and tell me that there is nothing they can do.
It is really affecting hugely my life and it seems that they don't really understand that. I am not particularly stressed and there is nothing obviously wrong about my way of life (I have a really healthy diet since I have those problems of course).
My first question is, can it be IBS considering my problems are mainly about stomach rather than bowel? (I have no diarrhoea or constipation).
Then, does someone have a similar experience to share or any advice to give? (seeing a naturopath, and any doctor?)
Thank you very much

"My son was diagnosed with IBS in September. He has now had an ultra sound scan, MAG 3 scan and Meckels scan with nothing found. So IBS is the diagnosis. When I read other people's symptoms my son doesn't seem to fit with these. He has not been constipated or had diarrheoa or bloated tummy. He just has terrible tummy pain. It comes for a few days/a week at a time and then can disappear for weeks. I have kept a food diary but there seems to be no pattern. He says it is cramp like pain but isn't terribly good at describing the pain. He rolls about in pain when he is at his worse. He has now missed school a few days which we have managed to avoid up until now. He had blood in his poo a month ago and was kept in hospital overnight and a scope was put in to look for an ulcer. I am feeling pretty helpless and although the Doctors have been great I am wondering if anyone else may have any advice. He has buscopan which helps little. He has been given an antacid which has mixed results but they are wondering if he is sensitive to acid. He is a pretty anxious boy but he appears to get sore sometimes even when he doesn't have anything to be stressed about. Any help/advice would be gratefully received.

"Hi everyone
I'll try and keep this as short as I can but I want to get as much info as possible in.
I'm a 30-yr-old female who's ever so slightly overweight (1 mark above my BMI). I've been suffering with bowel problems for roughly two months now. I always went to the loo every 3-4 days and passed a healthy stool, but a few days before my period at the beginning of March I started with constipation and a tenesmus feeling with tingling around my bottom and thighs. Because I was straining this led to me hurting a coccyx muscle on the right side (which still hurts) and a heavy feeling PR. A few days after my period I then started getting very loose sticky stools and had been going to the loo 2-3 times a day. I tried dietary modification i.e. decreasing fibre intake but that would make me constipated again. Also tried increasing my water intake but again I'd start with the loose sticky stools that are VERY hard to clean. In my loose stools there's always undigested food like salad or peppers. At first I thought there was blood but when I omitted red food from my diet the redness would not appear in my stool (although the other day there was a tiny bit of redness that was part of the stool itself but no red on the paper or floating around in the loo and I hadn't eaten anything red). I joined the gym and have been going three times a week for the last month thinking exercise would help but so far, no joy! I also have a lot of rumbling during the day, especially in the morning.
I've been to the GP who had a good listen and feel around my abdo, arranged a host of bloods, coeliac screen and stool sample but all came back clear. It was then I was diagnosed with IBS and told to 'watch and wait' with advice to take peppermint oil (Colpermin), which bloated me up so I stopped.
I'm still suffering. This morning I woke-up early with the same sharp pain I get every morning in the right lower abdomen accompanied by urgency, but I went to the loo and nothing happened. I ate a bowel of Fruit and Fibre with a glass of water and still nothing. Also, when I walk now, even just a few steps, I get a stitch-like feeling in my right side upper abdo under my ribs, but I don't feel it when I'm sat down. I'm beginning to think it's something serious and it's worrying me. I don't just want to go to the GP again and moan on about my symptoms only to be told it's my IBS though. Has anyone had similar problems? Would like to hear from you.
Thanks

"Right, to cut a long story short I had an outpatient appointment a few weeks ago and the doctor took blood and a stomach x-ray and said depending on what it showed, although he is certain I have IBS, they might get my GP to prescribe some medication.
Anyway, today I get a voicemail to call my GP surgery and was advised there was a prescription for me to collect after they got a letter from the hospital.
Can anyone advise what this is likely to do and how it's likely to leave me?
I have been prescribed two items:
Picolax Oral powder x 2 sachets. And to take one daily.
Docusate 100mg capsules x 100. Two, twice daily after finishing picolax.
The other instructions with this are for the Docusate and simply say:
IF diarrhoea please contact surgery re: altering dosage
IF symptoms recur after course finished then contact surgery to consider further prescription.
As I've not really been told anything else, I'm a bit confused and looking for some advice on this.
Will I be able to go to work on the days I'm taking the picolax? I am really running short of holidays so can't really afford to take time off.

"Hi,
I'm trying to get some advice regarding SIBO ( small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ) and the typical dosage of antibiotics/probiotic that would be used to treat it. I was diagnosed with IBS a few years back and was told there's basically nothing that can be done, other than daily laxatives and playing about with diet....in other words - Don't bother coming back !
Since then, I've tried all sorts of diets and read a whole lot of stuff, I even seen a local nutritionalist guy who advised against taking any laxatives at all ( Im only 35 . I followed his advice and cut out high fibre foods and stopped laxatives and for three years now Ive had virtually no constipation and been regular. The only problem I have is gas, hours of it after every meal I eat ( or drink ), I've had this since I was a kid and it's gotten worse, it's like the food just gets converted straight to it.
Ive read about SIBO and its similarity to IBS and think that maybe this could be my problem. I can get tested for it but it costs about 300 quid and the treatment is antibiotic/probiotics. I'm thinking of just giving myself a course of them via the internet, can anyone recommend a dosage.

"Hi, I'm 23 and have IBS type C (until a few months ago it was IBS type D but it suddenly changed). I've been on Mebeverine/Colofac for a while which helped a lot but my bowel movements have almost completely stopped and when I go managed to go my stools are small and very hard. I've increased my fibre a lot; my diet consists of porridge, pears, fig rolls (I can't stand figs), kiwi, strawberries, chickpeas, Dorset cereal and Crunchy Nut Cornflakes. I've just been prescribed Constella but the side effects sound absolutely hideous and I'm worried they'll be particularly severe for me as I've not reacted well in the past with similar medication, plus one side effect is stomach flu and when I last had that I ended up in hospital as my IBS flare up with it was so bad. It's really not ideal for me at the moment either as I have exams coming up and a few important meetings. I wondered what other people's experiences were? And also if anyone could recommend anything a bit more gentle which would encourage regular and softer bowel movements?

"I posted on here a couple of weeks ago about the pain that I was experiencing. Since then I have tried a number of different things that have changed how I am feeling. I recently got taken to hospital for the pain that I was in and the only thing that they said to me was that they could give me buscopan and to go home. I found that for a few days the pain didn't go away, I started to take buscopan tablets and these helped me a bit. Over the last week or two, the pain that I had has subsided, I think that this May be because of having less stress in my life, by relieving the stress of has helped me an awful lot. I know during work it is hard to have little stress but having it reduced has certainly helped.
I don't know how long it is going to last this time before the pain starts again, but hopefull it will be a long time.

"Hi, just wanted to get some advice from people in the know, with regards to my symptoms as they seem very similar to that of IBS sufferers, so wanted to see what you thought please.
It all happened very suddenly and one night October last year I woke in the night with horrendous stomach pains that I was doubled over in pain with, didn't know what to do with myself as whether I stood, laid or sat they were constant with occasionally extra stabbing ones too. I was sick a bit and had diarrhoea. I thought it was my appendix and didn't know if I should call an ambulance as not experienced pain like that, but ended up in a heap on the bathroom floor. The following morning I shuffled to the doctors as couldn't stand straight with the pain and he was thorough but sent me to a&e where I was prodded and poked around for the next 8 hours, they said my bowel was inflamed but put it down to gastritinitus and sent me home.
I didn't think it was that due to the severity of the pain which stayed with me for 3 days and then started to ease, but left me with a dull ache on lower right hand side for a good week. I kept getting niggles and was aware of dull aches etc, and then about a month later the exact same pain came again one night, id been out all day with no problem or warning but then it happened again. this time only a tiny bit sick and no diarrhoea, but horrendous pain aginand the same patterned followed after.
In total I had the intense pain 3 times in last 6 months. I was sent to a gynaecologist as scans hadn't shown anything or blood tests. My doctor thought it was endometriosis but the gynae doesn't think it is, and I go back in a month to see how I've been.
I haven't had the intense pain for 2 months, just niggles and quite bubbly tummy at times but that's been all, if I eat a big meal can be a bit painful at night but seems to pass.
IBS hasn't been mentioned by anyone, but just from doing my own research I came across things that seemed very similar, so wanted to go in to my next appointment armed with info so I cant be fobbed off or just left to see what may happen, as the intense pain has me bed ridden which is not me, so shows how bad it is.
I look forward to hearing from you and any views or info you can give.
Thank you

I'm posting on behalf of my partner who has been suffering from severe IBS for the past few years. During this time she has had daily visits to doctors, dietitians and clinics who have carried out multiple tests for things such as food allergies etc. The pain is now almost unbearable each day and the doctor has resorted to giving a weekly supply of Diarrhea tablets. Does anyone know of any private clinics/consultants in Northern Ireland?

"Earlier this winter I suffered for prolonged constipation symptoms that lasted for three months. Then in May my intestinal habits alternated and I developed a strong urge for bowel movements early in the morning which is still present till now. Before the beginning of all these symptoms I had no health problems , followed athletic lifestyles and participated competitively in endurance races.
Since the symptoms began I my energy levels gradually dropped, I started to become itchy eyes and under eye circles and lost some weight and muscle mass. I also become abdomen pain and bloating after fairly light meals
I visited my family doctor in June ,had blood tests that came clean but with my white blood cells a little low. I started eating larger portions and maintained fitness habits {endurance ,strength training} and managed to gain weight and my white blood cell levels came normal in the next test.
However morning diarrhea{although milder} , tiredness , and itchy ,blurry eyes still persist. My endurance performance surprisingly gets better {I run 10km in 43 minutes and for the last season my best time was 46 minutes} but my muscle mass is weakening. I sleep really well but when I go out with my friends and time goes past 21.30 my eyes become really dry ,I get blurry and can't have fun.
I did some research and found that a serious intestinal parasite infection could be the cause for my symptoms. What do you guys think?

"Hi guys. I've been a reader of this site for a while and even though I've never contributed you have helped me so much! I'm going through a bit of a tricky time at the mo' and I'm confused by my IBS so hopefully one of you will be able to offer some insight.
Background: I suffered from IBS type D for about two years. My attacks would come on pretty suddenly and the pain was horrendous. I'd been on audmonal for when the attacks were particularly bad but after the first year I had it relatively under control although there was the odd flare up. In November though I had a loss of sensation and pins and needles in my arms and legs. I was subsequently diagnosed with a deficiency in vitamin B12 and had injections over two weeks to get my levels up. In Dec 2013 my IBS felt much better; I was actually able to indulge a bit over Christmas without any bad side effects. However, my pins and needles were returning.
In January this year there was a sudden change. One night at midnight I felt severely constipated; I had the urge to go but nothing happened. Cramps followed and this triggered a nasty attack of diarrhea. I had a very basic diet the next two days but on the third morning since I had a bout of IBS type D again (which was fine as at least that was normal). Since then though I've just not been able to go. I've increased my fibre substantially and have the urge to go but nothing happens. If I get cramps then it's almost always in the middle of the night which is unusual for IBS. I went to be doctor and he gave me mebeverine; he also said my returning problems with my arms and legs was due to a lack of folic acid so I've just started taking folic acid supplements. The mebeverine worked for a couple of weeks but now it feels like it has almost completely stopped working. I'm going back to my GP next week but I just wondered if this was normal for IBS or could something else be going on?
And also, which foods would help my IBS type C? I usually have two bowls of porridge a day and some strawberries. If I have a proper meal then it's chicken cacciatore but with added carrots. I've eliminated red meat from my diet but I do still have a high sugar diet. If I got rid of the sugar would that help?
Any information would be appreciated. It's really starting to impact on my life and work.
Thank you so much.
Steph.

"Hi, I am a 48 year old male carrying a little extra weight.
I have always had a few issues with my stomach, I am on regular pills from the doctor to control
acid, Omeprazole 20mg probably mainly due to shift work.
White bread has always upset me.
Normally I am fine but in the last three weeks my stomach has been really swollen up and hard.
It seems to go down overnight but as soon as I have breakfast its up again.
Normal waist is 42-44 but tonight when we measured it was 47!!!
It does not hurt, more of a discomfort but its a real pain and is a real trouser buster when sitting at work.
I have looked at the possibility of IBS and Gluten intolerance and when I get some time off work I'll try and get tested.
But I was hoping for some suggestions and help from here?
Toilet habits are more or less normal, did have some constipation a few weeks back then the opposite.
Also feel tired after being awake for maybe four or fives hours
Thanks

"Hi,
My doctor has stated he thinks I am suffering from IBS. I have severe stomach cramps and pains, heartburn, headaches, on occasion I find it hard to go to the toilet however this is very seldom. The pains have been horrific, I have had scans done which ruled out Gallstones etc. I had H pylori years ago which tests have confirmed is gone. So this has been ruled out as well. Reading up on IBS most people suffer from a change in bowel movements, can anyone tell me if they have IBS without any change in bowels? I am not 100% convinced I have IBS.

"Hello again,
I recently put a post on here about my ibs symptoms and since have been referred to see a gastroenterologist. I have also started a rather detailed food diary to try and trend my symptoms. 4 days ago I started VSL#3 probiotic sachet. 2 days ago my stomach felt great, no issues, stools normal, really energetic..etc. Anyway I've started to feel a bit sh*t again. Looking through my food diary and what I have eaten along with the replies to my previous post on the forum I want to find out a few things about coeliac disease.
1) is it possible to coeliac disease through bad diet, too much gluten, alcohol etc? I could eat anything I wanted a few years ago without issue...now different story.
2) coeliacs eat gluten free so is it fair to say if I eat a lot of gluten my symptoms should be worse?
3) after eating gluten is there a time between consuming gluten and symptoms setting in? The reason I ask this is 2 days ago when I felt tip top, I was eating a fair amount of gluten...looking online about digestion and transit time I was wondering whether the reason in feeling rough now is the gluten I had a couple of days ago.
4) with coeliac disease would probiotics actually help in any way?
5) are there other 'triggers' for coeliac? Such as greasy food, alcohol...etc?
One thing that I'm sure you can all relate to is I seem to make progress with improving my ibs, through diet, probiotics, lifestyle change...etc...yet all I can really say 100% is lowering my sugar intake and quitting fizzy drinks has improved my symptoms hugely and has been consistently better since I did this...the rest is soo damn frustrating. 2 days ago I felt the best I ever had and thought these probiotics I was taking have been helping, but yet again things seem to have gone bad again.
Thanks.

"Hi , to start off im am a 24 year old female who has always been in reasonably good health , my weight has fluctuated somewhat throughout the years ( my own doing as I've had problems with hardly eating and eating too much , I don't know if this contributes to any factors of why I am in this pain now .... So it all started around a year ago I started to get rectal bleeding when going to the toilet usually if I strained or went a lot , and I did go a lot around 7 times a day .... doctors kept saying ibs so I just agreed and because there was no abdominal pain at this point I brushed it off . Then around 8 months ago i'd get a sudden sharp pain in lower left abdomen so bad it would make me cry and that was usually followed by a few bowel movements , sometimes painful and the pain subsided after 6 hours or so .. This happened several times .....In December I was on antibiotics for a bad chest infection which is when the problem I've had since pretty much then started after the antibiotics , It started as an infection in my
Bladder , like cystitis but pain in my legs also and back , then couple of days on came the bowel problems , mucus in stool , black bits in it , sometimes very pale ones , the swelling feeling moved from the lower left to the right as well and I felt ballooned and in agony ... I also had faintness , neusea , back pain , a pain in my throat / sore throat , which I still get 10 weeks on , my blood test showed inflamation and protein count was slightly abnormal but the doctor said nothing to worry about , I'm having a flex. Colonoscopy end of this month , I believe it to be colitis as my large intestine is always inflamed and from my blood test results , but the doctors even the gastrologist thought ibs is more likely , can ibs effect blood test results as I'm certain it doesn't

"Hello,
Right im going to try and keep this brief. 4 years ago i started having stomach issues, after all the usual NHS tests im told its IBS. Like you guys its impacted my life quite a bit and still struggling although I have managed to identify some of the triggers and things I have done to reduce symptoms.
1) Go Gluten Free - I started this diet a while back and the difference is massive. Less bloating, morning urges went, stomach feels more settled.
2) Cut out processed greasy food - I stopped eating pizza's, currys, chinese...etc.
3) Cut out beer - This made a massive improvement. I used to be able to drink whatever alcohol i wanted and my stomach would process it no problem...until i got IBS. Anyway, I tend to drink cider now and stay well clear of lager. Dont drink on an empty stomach.
4) Lower sugar intake - This by far has been the biggest improvement of my IBS EVER! I started reading a few articles and thinking about what changed around the time my stomach issues occurred and began to think and realised I consume a hell of a lot of sugar in my diet. I cut it out...all out at once. God I felt soo tired, thirsty, dizzy...like I was hungover for weeks. I was going to work feeling dizzy...BUT...this is what happened...
+ Diahrrea stopped burning and smelling soo foul. Stools were not loose.
+ Stomach rumbles and bloating stopped.
+ Headaches stopped
+ Brain fog stopped.
+ My sleeping pattern has improved.
+ Morning 'rush' to the toilet stopped.
+ I have loads more energy, focus and just generally feel better in myself.
5) Probiotics & vitamins. I have found taking 1 probiotic capsule a day, with a good multivitamin plus zinc has also helped. I dont have a great deal of knowledge on vitamins and cannot prove that they have worked, but following the article I read about quitting sugar and the success I had mentioned above, I thought the vitamin route would also help.
I hope this helps. So now for the bad bit...
With everything going on mentioned above...I have been 99% normal for over a month (something that has never happened before whilst having IBS) however last week when I was away things took a turn and I had an 'attack'. Things have been a bit hit and miss since. I think its dissapointment more than anything as i was convinced i was on the path to recovery.
Any thoughts or suggestions for further help would be great. I do have a couple of things im thinking about doing 1) taking VSL3 probiotic (seems highly recommended) & 2) taking enteric coated peppermint oil capsules. Whether this will work or not who knows.
IBS fustrates the hell out of me! Let me know what you think!

"I have just joined this former to ask about this as I am struggling.
I am 19 and for about 4 and a half years had a chronic illness called ME (Myalgic Encephomyelitis) and it is common for people with this to have gastrointestinal problems, problems they can't often get to the root of it seems.
I will list my symptoms and I ask if you could please offer any suggestions to what my issue may be and what I can do
*Constant nausea (again something common with ME), but particularly at night, the reasons I joined is because I have just had a very bad bout tonight. The nausea at night is so much worse than in the day.
*I think when I wake up, I have discomfort in my heart area which makes me think could it have something to do with acid reflux?
*My stomach, or the area under my left ribcage, is in constant discomfort.
*Certain foods make me feel very unwell, and I am on a diet called SCD which has been a means to help me. Again finding many foods you previously could eat, now difficult to eat, is common in ME too. The worst are fatty foods like nuts and oils, and also particular carbohydrates like rice, potato and I don't eat wheat either.
* Partly due to my ME, but a big part due to my stomach, I am in a wheelchair, but when I get out to do something or get something I feel worse the longer I am standing up (which isn't long at all) and this is exaggerated at night, so sometimes I don't feel too bad but once I have clean my teeth and got changed etc, that movement and standing up has made me feel much worse.
*i never actually vomit! the whole time I have had this illness I have not! but I feel so sick so sick I just can't explain.
Just a few last notes which might be important (feel free to ask me anything else too);
I am very slim and always have been and was very active etc. before becoming ill.
At night I sleep with lots of pillows so I can sit up in bed as lying down is worse (acid I guess), but I read today that isn't always good due to pressure on the stomach? Also in regards to pressure on the stomach, bending down or leaning for me is an issue, could anyone explain this pressure on the stomach problem?
I can't think of much else off the top of my head, I do see a doctor and have tried things like proton pump inhibitors, and I know some symptoms of low stomach acid can be like high, but i think this is high stomach acid.
Please reply with any help.

I will sometimes get a hankering for something that I know I shouldn't have, and then spend hours on the toilet beating myself up, and wondering why I ate that!

I missed one pill the other day and woke up with pain..though not as bad as i have had it. even though the mebervine is working it still feels like there is something there and have had some mild pain just recently....i suspect all the festive food and drinks havent helped.
Anyway the reason for the post is that i wondered if anyone has tried aloe vera and does it work and can it be taken with mebevefine.

"Hi,
I am a 26 yr old female who started having digestive issues about 10 months ago. I have always been fairly skinny (120lbs, 5' 10"" ) even when living in Italy stuffing my face with pizza and pasta. I get horrible gas, alternating constipation/diarrhea, bloating, etc. Sometimes i get abdominal pain after eating. Most symptoms occur mainly in the evening, though it can vary. I have undergone numerous tests with nothing concrete detected besides a severe lactose intolerance, in which the high hydrogen levels also suggested a bacterial infection. I was put on rifaximin, which improved symptoms until about 3 weeks after the dose. Completely eliminating lactose has also not helped much (i dont usually eat much dairy). The latest Doctor I saw put me on a very limited only veggie & meat/fish diet with small amounts of fruit, as he suspected candida. My symptoms have improved somewhat on the diet (especially if i limit veggies and avoid fruit) but I did a stool test which came back negative for candida. I was told to continue on the diet, given the improvement in symptoms (this was following two weeks of intense diarrhea and severe abdominal pain). This is concerning for me, as it is difficult to reach appropriate calorie levels.
Symptoms coincided with an attempt to follow a more healthy lifestyle (eating alot more fruits and veggies and fewer sugars/grains/processed foods). I also am very active- running, spinning, lifting. I think in the beginning I felt full from eating so much veggies but now realize (my sister showed me a calorie tracker app) that I was definitely consistently undereating by alot. During that period, I also started displaying the IBS symptoms, which made eating more difficult. I have always been skinny (usually about 120lbs, am 5'10"" ) but I now extremely skinny, having dropped to 105lbs.
I for the most part eat extremely clean- lots of fruits, veggies, and grilled fish, chicken, turkey, meat, tuna. My blood tests are normal except for low glucose, lower iron (though within the range). My TS3 and TS4 free levels are normal but my TSH levels are slightly high (3.8 & 4.2). I also am usually very tired, have difficulty sleeping, am much more irritable/depressed than I ever have been. I continue to workout as I am able, as that is something Ive always done and provides stress relief.
Can a low thyroid function or IBS be caused by the period in which i was eating too little or from being very skinny? I have tried eating more or eating more junk food/ eating the way i used to before i switched to eating healthier and my symptoms get worse. Im at my wits end, as I dont really know what to do or what could be causing this. If so, how can i rectify? I would really like to get my weight back up and be able to eat without looking pregnant or having horrible, embarassing gas or bathroom runs.

"Hi everyone, I am 22 years old. I suffered from ibs for around 8 months while at university and I skipped so many lectures due to that. I tried so many ways and nothing worked I was so desperate.
One thing I know for sure is that my ibs was caused by too much stress. I started to get anxious and became panicked very easily because of the ibs, which became another source of stress and worsened my symptoms. During summer vacation it was a little bit better but as soon as I started school again all the symptoms came back. I was so scared that ppl in my class would hear.

"I have had IBS now for about 2 years. I have always had regular bowel movements for as long as i can remember (up to 6x a day), the doctor always told me it was normal as it had been like this for so long. About 2 years ago i started developing very bad abdominal pains, and after many trips to the doctor he put me on Mebeverine (which i take 3 times a day, but i dont notice much difference). I also take Buscopan which do help after each meal. Unlike most people, i have had to cut out my favourite foods of fruit and veg and home cooked foods. I now eat processed foods and general rubbish which seems to ease the pain??!
The doctor finally referred me to the hospital for cameras up and down me, they found nothing, but am waiting for the results of 4 biopsies that were taken.
I find i am in immense pain after eating most foods and the wind is the most painful. It is so difficult being in work as i have to excuse myself so often to go to the toilet...not always to go, but to relieve the wind. It is also very offensive, and am embarrassed about it, but there is nothing i can do. I can find myself going to the toilet sometimes twice in one meal, and if not, usually within 20mins of eating.
I also Love food and have had to stop working in the food industry. The more i eat, the less i keep in me, i am always tired due to lack of nutrients staying in my body. I am constantly eating.... and i have lost a load of weight. I now get myself worked up before i eat, if i go to a friends house, or just go out in general. I am only 31 and getting married next year, and it is a massive concern for me. I have made an appointment to see a hypnotherapist, to try and take the anxiety away.
I go to bed crying most nights in pain and found myself sat on the toilet in work for 15mins crying in pain after a lunch i had.
The main culprits are mayonnaise, nuts, fruit and veg. as mentioned i have friend chicken and chips for lunch most days as this doesnt seem to have any effect on me???!
Has anyone else been through anything similar? Any help or advice welcomed!

"Hi everyone! My name is Sophie and I am nineteen years old. I have been suffering from irritable bowel syndrome for the past three years. I have been experiencing severe abdominal pain, cramps, alternation between constipation and diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, back pain and fibromyalgia. I had to stop exercising as much as I used to because of the pain and I can't stay out of the house for too long anymore. I am in pain everyday and I have thought about commiting suicide in the past. I didn't give up though and I have decided to fight this hell like the rest of you. Due to a liver problem that I have I can't take painkillers so I am in a lot of pain without having a way out. Doctors told me I will probably have IBS for the rest of my life and that I should endure the pain without pills. I have tried doing therapeutic yoga and acupuncture but it didn't help at all. I even took some herbal ''painkillers'' following alternative medicine but that didn't work out either. If anyone has any advice to share on how to reduce the abdominal pain or the fibromyalgia I would really appreciate it. I also read somewhere that medicinal marijuana helps with the pain, so if anyone gave it a try please let me know how it worked out for you. Stay strong and don't ever give up!

"Hello, I wonder if you can help me as i think you will be my last resort.
I've suffered chronic lower right abdominal pain for around 12 years. I have had both ovaries removed along with my appendix as doctors thought the pain may stem from these. I'm still in agony on a daily basis which is making my life intolerable.
I'm an emotional wreck most of the time and sleep in ten minute cycles when the pain is severe. I get pain daily and have to take cocodomol prescribed by my GP just to get me to work in a morning, I'm also meant to take HRT due to my ovaries been removed for brittle bones but I'm reluctant to keep feeding my body pills when I'm still in such severe pain. I've recently been back to a specialist who now says my pain is probably dysfunctional bowel disorder and my lining of my bowel is a little thin causing this awful pain.I am in extreme pain if I am waiting for Bowel movement, which gets increasingly worse after bowel movement, I don't want to eat, as I know I will be in pain leading up to a bowel movement and for days after movement. For example I had movement on Wednesday and Thursday and I have been in agony ever since. I feel I can't go on and my quality of life is not worth living. Some days I can tolerate the pain but most days I get myself in such a state I want to end it all.
Is there anything you can do to help me please? Or five any advice as every time I seem to go to the doctors they come across as though there thinking ""oh here she is again"" I feel I'm a burden but how can they leave me in this much pain
Yours hopefully

"I have been troubled with digestive disorders for many, many years. In the last year things have got very much worse,
When my digestive system is empty (first thing in morning) I feel ok usually. It is an hour or so after eating that the nausea and/or pain starts, it lasts for an hour or more and eventually eases off until I eat again.
I have had an ultra sound and CT scan of the abdomen and a Gastroscope plus a biopsy for H.Pylori which was negative. All the results have been normal. I have been on several different types of PPI drugs with no improvement. Earlier this year I was put on an IBS exclusion diet, nothing improved while I was on it nor was there any effect when i was phased off it.
I have been on a wheat free diet for over two years but nothing improved.
My life is almost totally dictated by this dreadful problem which no Doctor can find a name for. Please, can anyone offer any help. Thank you

"I have yet to read about anyone else with the same experience. I am 75 years of age and have been having problems that seem to fit the IB syndrome for the last year or two. A few months ago I had a really bad episode, lasting a whole night and half the next day of extremely painful cramping that made me scream, diarrhoea and vomiting, all at the same time. The sweating was intense and the heat from my face and hands was tremendous. I felt that I was going to explode or die. Then something happened that really terrified me.

"Hello fellow IBS sufferers.
I've had IBS-D, quite badly, for over 20 years, and have recently found a few surprising things that have really helped.
The first one: cutting out gum! It's so simple, but it seems to have had an amazing effect. Less bloated, less cramping etc... It's possibly to do with the sorbitol in gum (which exacerbates IBS-D symptoms), and partly to do with chewing - swallowing pockets of air as a result of chewing, and oour digestive system think that we're eating, given that we're chewing, so it puts our poop mechanism in motion, which makes us have to go far more often than we should. Whatever the reason, cutting out gum has definitely helped a lot.
The other thing that's really helped is that I've found 'flatulence filtering underwear' (yup, anti-smell fart pants). I found it hard to believe that they would actually work, but they really do! And when IBS is bad, gas gets really bad (both in quantity and, ummm, quality) and holding it in can be incredibly painful. These underwear work in two ways. The first, is that there's less pressure to hold gas in, for hours on end, which means much less pain. And knowing that, means less worry, which means less stress, which means less gas and bloating. So I've found that just wearing the underwear, and knowing that it's not the end of the world if I do get very gassy, has meant that my stomach has been a lot calmer and happier, and therefore less gassy, less bloated and less painful. They've helped so much! There is a company in the UK called Shreddies, that makes them (those are the ones I've tried, and they really work). I'm sure there are other companies that make them as well. They're well worth it, as they take away the bloating, which takes away some of the stress associated with IBS, which takes away the urgent need to find a loo.
And the other 2 things (which I've known for a while) is that sugar makes my IBS a lot worse, as it feeds bad bacteria, which creates a bad environment in our stomachs, which makes IBS worse. Limiting sugar intake really helps. And taking a probiotic which you can tolerate also really helps, as it kills the bad bacteria, and helps the good bacteria, which creates a healthier environment in our stomachs.
I hope that helps! I've had IBS for years, have been devastated by it at times (in pain, not able to do things, tailoring my life to it) but the above suggestions have definitely helped.

"My boyfriend has had severe stomach cramps and diarrhoea intermittently for the past year and a half and the situation is becoming intolerable.
The symptoms are:
- Extremely severe abdominal cramps, he describes the location as ""from tummy button to bum"".
- [GROSSNESS WARNING] Orange diarrhoea
He gets the symptoms very quickly after eating, before the food has even been digested he reckons. It is literally incapacitating at times, and it is making it hard to lead a normal life.
His doctor says he has IBS, and has prescribed him:
- loperamide: used to work 1 tablet every fewdays, now taking several a day for any effect
- peppermint oil: no effect
- mebeverine: no effect
- alverine: no effect
- lansoprazole: virtually eliminated heartburn
- co-codamol: initially effective, but reduced effectiveness over time and side effects included drowsiness and nausea.
He had a endoscopy and biopsies taken and they say nothing appeared abnormal. (Intestines apparently in ""perfect condition"" )
My only suggestion is that he has an intolerance to some kind of food, but the doctor has not referred him for tests, and the specialist said that there was no conclusive link between diet and symptoms of IBS. He is prescribed tablets instead.
I'm getting desperate... Any suggestions (including reliable health forums) gratefully received.

"I have been having issues on and off for as long as I can remember, any change in my life and mydigestion gets a bit out of sync, but more so in the last 3 or 4 years.
I have been to the Dr and they have ruled out several conditions and have now said that they think I have IBS.
My symptoms are nausea ranging from quite mild to sevear and the feeling you have just before you are going to be sick, the nausea used to be the odd day here and there and the sick feeling once a m month or less but recently it is pretty constant. I very rarely get pains in my tummy and don't really s suffer from constipation or diarrhoea although by bowels never seem to be very settled, I do get the need to go fairly urgently in the morning and don't always feel like I am empty if that makes sense, Ialso feel sick when really I need the toilet and if I go that feeling goes away.
I am just not sure the sickness is IBS and the doctor wants to treat me with anti depressants which make me feel very sick so worse than I do already and I have a fear/ phobia of sick so it is really really upsetting me and don't want to start the anti depressants if I don't really need them.

"I am 19 and for the last 7 months I've had diarreah everyday. At first it wasn't so bad and I would have stomach pain and have to go to the toilet frequently of a morning but then I would be okay to go out throughout the day although of a night it would return I was embarrassed at first but then decided to go to the doctor who said I had ibs gave me some tablets and said to see him again in a month, the tablets didn't help at all I was taking Imodium also so I could go out but became addicted so my mom told me to stop taking them. I then went to visit my dad for a couple of months but whilst I was away they saw the everyday struggle I had and took me to see their doctor they also gave me tablets for ibs which did not help I had blood tests for intolerance to wheat and gluten and for celiac and chrons disease which all came back normal I had an internal assessment but she found nothing abnormal. When I returned home I went back to see my doctor who told me although my test came back clear to wheat intolerance to avoid eating it and drink actimel once a day. I left the doctors and went straight to sign up to another practise although when I went there the doctor was very rue and told me I shouldn't have bothered changing doctors as she also thinks its ibs but tablets she gave me haven't helped either I had more blood tests to test for a stomach infection and also a stool sample but both came back normal. I've started beginning to feel very depressed I have a 3 year old son who I can't do much with these days as I can rarely leave the house I feel this is ruining my life I can't go out to work as I'm constantly ill I don't leave the house I do all my shopping online I don't see my friends I don't take my son out to do the things we should be doing at his age sometimes I wake up at 4-5 in the morning almost crying as the pain is so bad and have to sit on the toilet for sometimes over an hour it's knocking my confidence so much but I don't believe this is ibs but don't know what else it could be.

"Hi guys,
Could really use a little help or advice with my recent digestive issues. I'm 24, have always been pretty healthy and never experienced any bad stomach problems barring the very occasional virus. I have a fairly good diet (could probably do with eating a little more fruit) and keep fit.
I guess it started a couple of months ago. I switched to a new protein shake and experienced quite bad flatulence and was perhaps a little constipated but wasn't in any pain and apart from the bad odour of the gas, it wasn't bothering me at all. I have since stopped using this shake. Then a couple of weeks ago I had a couple of days of diarrhea - to be fair there was a virus going round at the time - and then went back to being more constipated. I took Pepto Bismol for a couple of days and this seemed to sort things out, my toilet visits were basically back to normal and I wasn't constipated or having diarrhea. My PB tablets ran out and then suddenly the last few days I've had really bad stomach cramps and trapped wind. The cramps were particularly bad when I was on a date on Wednesday and I felt so uncomfrtable. I went to the GP and he said it could be a huge range of things, possibly IBS, and prescribed Mebeverine. I have taken these for 2 days and haven't experienced much change but am now constipated again and feel slightly sick as well as gassy. I have some blood tests next week and my GP wasn't at all convinced that it's IBS, am I best off not taking Mebeverine until he's more sure? And if so can someone recommend something to take? Was thinking about going back to BP and maybe use Peppermint Oil tablets too...
I've just started a new relationship and really want to get my digestion back on track, the stomach pain and gas of the last few days has been getting me down/playing on my mind.

"My friend is a spinal injured since the early 70's. Never had serious problems until about 5 years ago. Gradually pain and discomford getting worse. Several visits to doctors, general hospitals and spinal hospitals. All sorts of horrable tests have been carried but nothing serious found.
So in the meantime he's stuck with lots of pain and a doctor putting it on neurological pain and saying you'll have to learn to live with it. Others say the pain isn't really there so on several occasions he's been put on tablets that worked on the brain, because he says doctors think I'm imagining the pain...
All this and bad experiences in several hospitals (who don't know enough about Spinal injured) made him reluctant to find out what causes the severe pain and discomfort.
Over the last year the pain and discomfort has gone from bad to worse and now comes to an unbareable stage. Lyrica, paracetamol and other painkillers no longer seem to work.
His complaints probably causing the pain are mostly Spasms, bloating which goes as suddenly as it comes, urge to go.
His stomach sometimes feels that swollen that he can't breath properly.
Other complaints are constipation/no result for days neither to laxatives, or the opposite... going well for days. No matter which one it is, it all gives bad spasms and pain. He's suffering from bad sometimes painfull burps which sometimes can be embarroussing.
It's probably too much too even explain to you but, he's just so tired of it all, he's stressed about it and hasn't had a proper night sleep for months... I just want to help him getting rid of the pain and to see and hear him sleep for a full night so his carers have a good night sleep as well.
Yesterday while I was looking for causes of mucous and happen to end up on an IBS website and reading all the info I could tick all the symptoms (including the mucous) my friend suffers from.
I've now got a few questions about it to which I hope to get an answer on here...
* Is IBS easily diagnosed?
* Can IBS develop over a year time or is it more likely that it's been there but went unnoticed?
* Is it wise to use laxatives when suffering from IBS?

"I'm 66 and began in September with what I thought was a tummy bug - although I had had 'off' days
before this when I had to rush to the toilet and felt unwell. The excess wind, extremely frequent
bowel motions with urgency (including a lot of mucus) and generally feeling unwell continued for
about six weeks. Because of my age, my GP referred me to the hospital. He thought my problem
might be Diverticular Disease. The doctor there prescribed Creon to help with my digestion (I had
my gall bladder removed three years ago) and organised a colonoscopy. I've just had the
colonoscopy today and everything is clear. I know this is good news, but I'm now left wondering
what was/is wrong. The consultant who performed the colonoscopy said my symptoms were
probably the result of an IBS type of disease and has referred me back to my GP. Is IBS possible? Would an IBS flare last so long? I'd be grateful for any advice before I go back to my GP for a chat.

"I have suffered with IBS for nearly 10 years. It is usually in the form of constipation and horrendous bloating, however occasionally I get agonising cramps to the point of almost passing out. I do have a high stress job which i know doesn't help, but I'm not going to give that up, so I had to look for other options. Over the years my GP has referred me for colonoscopies and biopsies of the bowel. I have tried mebeverin, buscopan, peppermint oil tablets, all sorts. None of it made a difference, until I found INTESTAID IB about a year ago. I buy it from Boots where it is often on their 3 for 2 offer, because it isn't cheap. It costs about £25 for a month's supply, but it is totally worth it. I'm sorry if this sounds like an advert - I promise it isn't. Initially you have to take it twice a day for the first month. I don't know how it works, but this seems to settle down the intestines/bowel. After the first month, my symptoms had almost disappeared and then I could reduce it to one tablet a day. I'm not going to say that I never have any problems at all, but I would say that my symptoms have reduced by about 90%. All I would say is try it for a few months. Quite honestly, I was at the stage where I would have tried anything, because I felt so ill for much of the time.

"Hey all. In the past few months I've had a lot of problems with abdominal pain and on and off constipation/diarrhea for which I've been put on all number of antibiotics (they were first sure it was a urine infection).
Last week it got a lot worse, I had pain in my back and constant dull achey pain in my stomach, so I went to my new gp. He said it was more than likely to be ibs because I'd had a ultrasound of my kidneys and urinary tract so they could rule out anything like kidney stones or cysts. He put me on fybrogel and the pain got a little better to the point that when I was on my period over the weekend it completely disappeared (but I wondered if that was just because of that). But now it's come back a lot worse - last night I was getting sharp stabbing pains in my right side, so much so I was almost thinking it was a problem with my appendix but the source of the pain seems to be a bit too low for that.
Today I've continued to get recurring very sharp spasms of pain normally in my right side but very occasionally in my left. Other symptoms are that I am getting a lot of white balls in my stool (probably too large to be parasites) which don't change at all depending on what food I have (sorry for the graphic info) and very slight chest pain. I don't think this is normal of IBS, or is it? Can the pain get that severe? I think I should see my gp again, the only problem being that no doubt I'll have to wait several days to get an appointment to see him, so any advice or musings in the meantime woud be much appreciated!

"Hi,
I've been diagnosed with IBS a couple of years ago. I have very loose stools most of the time as well as gas (and resulting stomach problems) and pains, also bladder problems (is this common among IBS sufferers)? The pains are usually just general pains in the abdominal area, but recently they have sometimes become worse, like really extreme sharp pains around the abdomen and rectum after I woke up at night and particularly when I was lying on the stomach - it did feel like these pains might partly have been linked to gas as well. Do you get really bad pains like that with IBS? If I've had a stool test that turned out fine a few weeks ago, would that definitely rule out other intestinal diseases? I'm a bit scared there might be more behind it after all. Also, apart from what not to eat, are there any specific foods that it is good to eat against loose stools?
Thanks very much.

"Hi, I am new to this site and have been suffering with IBS for a while, but I have only just found this forum after recently buying a laptop!
The main problem I have is with constipation, diarrhea and acid reflux. Does anyone mind sharing their main problems and how they deal with these symptoms? I have tried over the counter remedies but they don’t always work. Thanks.

"Hey, I joined this Forum so I could speak to other people with ibs as I'm not getting anywhere with the Doctors or on my own.
My problem came out of nowhere, one minute I could eat and drink whatever I wanted, the next day I had nausea, stomach pains and dizziness.
All I can eat is dry food, potatoes and fish. At first I could eat chicken but now, like anything else, it gives me diaherrea.
I've tried lots of medication for ibs to no effect, including peppermint oil caps. I already did Yoga for stress (but stress and worry doesn't affect me, nor does my monthlys). I eat small meals often. I have been told ibs is what I have, but I wanted the oppinions from others.
My most frequent symptoms (all symptoms are worse at night)
Nausea (all the time, though worse for about half an hour after eating. And worse at night)
Pain (In my stomach between the bottom of my rib cage and the top of my belly button, and it's like sharp stabbing pains)
Dizzy/faint
Tired, no energy
indigestion feeling
Muscle twitches in legs and arms
I've lost 4 stone in 5 months
Occasionally bloated, wind (though mostly through my mouth)
And seem to be better with the less I eat.
My stools are fine when I stick to potatoe and fish everyday, but if I eat anything else I get diaherrea for a day. If it is ibs I don't have it as bad as some people symptom wise, but I can't hardly eat anything.
I've had an X-ray, had tests for Crohn's, celiac and Thyroid. I've cut wheat from my diet 3 days ago and there hasn't been much effect so far.
Can anyone suggest what I can do to feel better? meds that work? Does it sound like ibs too you?
Thanks for all your help

through me. I want to try and treat this myself with diet or OTC medicines as I already have to take

"Went to the doctors monday (19/4/2010) as been suffering with IBS type symtoms for several months. The doctors confirmed i had IBS and perscribed me Mebeverine and was told to take 3 times a day.
I got home and took one straight away and within an hour I was in SEVERE pain, worse than anything I have felt before that came in waves in my abdominal area and lasted for the majority of the night
I contined to take as perscribed the following day and again continued to get pains in my stomach. It came to the evening and managed to get to sleep but woke up in the night being sick several times!
I went back to the doctors this morning and described what had happend in the past couple of days. I was told to come back for blood tests and got told that I had a higher temperature and that I did have IBS but this spell of pain was infact Gastro ent!!!! (what a joke as I only started feeling sick since taking the tablets)
I have not taken the tablets today and felt better for it. I am visiting the doctor again tomorrow to see what he suggests.
I believe these symptoms have definately been side effects of Mebeverine.

"Hi
I have just been diagnosed with IBS and I'm a little unsure what this will mean for me. I was wondering if anyone can give me some advice?
My symptoms started last November when I was admitted to hospital with severe abdo pain in the lower right hand side. I had also had on and off symptoms of diarrhoea, rectal bleeding and passing mucus. I had an ultrasound and CT scan which didn't show anything wrong. As my symptoms did not settle over the next couple of days the doctors performed a diagnostic laparoscopy, as they suspected appendicitis, but this also did not show any abnormalities. I was discharged home when my pain was under control and saw my GP who prescribed Mebeverine as he thought it could be IBS. This did not help at all and I was admitted to hospital again in February this year with the same symptoms. This time, the doctors were thinking it could be Crohns disease as I have a family history. I had another ultrasound and an MRI scan of my small bowel, which again didn't show anything. I was discharged again and my GP referred me to the Gastroenterology department, suggesting that I have a colonoscopy. Whilst waiting for this I had another admission and yet another ultrasound scan, again this was negative.
Ever since the first admission, I have been on 5 different types of painkillers, including a liquid Morphine. Obviously being on painkillers of this strength is making me feel tired and weak in myself and I have no life. I spend the majority of the time in the house and some days can not even get out of bed. I have three young children and my husband has had to give up work to care for them. I feel as though I am missing out on enjoying time with my children and caring for them and also I feel guilty that I can't do things for them as much as I'd like to and also that I can't do much housework and my husband has to do everything. I have also been prescribed antidepressants as a result of this. I really am getting to the end of my tether.
I was pinning my hopes on the colonoscopy giving a diagnosis, as I have had every other test there is. I have just had the colonoscopy and surprise surprise it was clear. Don't get me wrong I am reassured that it is nothing serious but I am frustrated that I still don't have any answers and am still suffering. The hospital has now given me the diagnosis of IBS and discharged me back to my GP to manage it.
I was just wondering/hoping anyone can give me some advice on dealing with it as I am really scared that I am just going to be stuck like this. If anyone has been through or going through the same sort of situation I would be grateful for any help you can offer.
Thanks

"Hi.
I've actually been quite anxious and have thought it might be a good idea to discuss my recent thoughts/feelings/anxieties amongst those who have got/had similar problems, issues etc.
To be fair, I have bored my wife of this for many months now, which only goes to show I really need to speak to those who are in the same boat.
I'll list as much as I can about myself, symptoms etc, but really looking to see whether others have similar symptoms/worries, or if it really is just me.
I'm a 33 year old male, being diagnosed with IBS around October 2011.
It is quite a long story, so you may need to bare with me whilst I bullet my points down (what I think are significant points).
I gave up smoking in Jan11, with the aid of Champix.
This was succesful (still not smoking 8) ), and came off Champix around June (although I did question with the nurse if I should have come off gradually, but she said no (even though I did about 3 years earlier!)).
Around March11, I noticed an increase in flatulence, and a marked increase in the 'wiff' :oops:
Lets say it wasn't well received, and after some time (I think June) I went to the doctors.
I was told at this point, it was likely to just be a change in my digestion - part and parcel of both the medication and giving up smoking.
Anyway, I continued on my way, and never thought about it too much.
Just to note, in May11, I also changed my job (was quite a change to the last 10 years - nothing stressful, but a big change in the way I worked (both positive and negative)).
This was a move of my choice, so no stress of redundency.
During September I noticed quite a dramatic change.
My 'wiff' disappeared, and was replaced with loose stools (bristol chart 7).
I have been back to the doctors numerous times, and have been essentially diagnosed with IBS.
I was first prescribed peppermint capsules, which had not effect.
I then tried loperamide for a couple of weeks, one after each loose stool, with no effect - by this time I am having bowel movements 4-6 times a day on average.
I have now been on Mebeverine for 1 week and 1 day, and whilst I still have loose stools, I have about once a day more of a bristol chart 6 stool.
However, I am now a little worried that this also is not working.
Since taking this, I also seem to have developed 'dump syndrome' - not all the time, and mostly in the evenings.
Now comes the anxiety.
When I originally went in with my loose stools, the doctor (I guess jokingly) said \""well we will test for caeliac first, and if that comes back negative, there are plenty more things we can try before we have to worry about the big C\"".
Well, that panicked me straight away, and thanks to 'google-scaring' myself, I do feel quite anxious at times.
The reason - whilst I do not have blood mixed in with my stools, I do sometimes have, at the end of passing my stools, a little red blood (seperate to the stool itself).
I have now had full blood and stool tests.
Nothing has shown up (iron levels, inflammatory markers, bacterial infections), and a different doctor has said the blood is most likely to be coming from my rectum due to passing (and physically pushing (with no stool)) of stools at the frequency I have.
No haemarroids that he could see.
I also do not feel or look dehydrated.
Anyway, on my last visit to the doctors, I mentioned my anxiety and what the first doctor had said, and she has now booked me in to a gastro-specialist to at least remove my worries.
I now have a follow up appointment with my doctor next week, and a telephone assessment next week also.
Apart form the diarrhea, the only other symptons I have are:
1. Bloated feeling (mainly in the evenings) and in the upper part of my digestive symptons (just below my rib cage).
2. Occasional feeling to empty my bowels after passing stools and dump syndrome.
3. Occasional blood after passing stools - separate to the stool itself, but right at the end of my stools
I also get the 'gurgling' tummy, but would have thought I would with the diarrhea.
I however have no pains at all, vomiting, weight loss or any other symptoms come to think of it.
It may however be worth mentioning that since giving up smoking I have put on over 1 stone in weight, and my diet is poor (I do eat the correct foods, but a lot of what I shouldn't eat).
I also found out I was going away on business for a week not long before my diarrhea started - but I am used to being away from my family (although not for a whole week).
Sorry there is so much information, but at times I feel quite alone, but also anxious it is something else.
I mean, is diarrhea something that can be long lasting, even with medication?
Has anyone else had passing of blood?
Does it take time for the medication to work?
Am I just being paranoid?
Anything anybody can advise would be appreciated and comforting.
Thank you.

"Hi! I've had IBS for about 8 years now, to varying degrees of severity. In the last couple of months it's flared up particularly badly, specifically with relation to the pain (which is getting quite severe) and diorreah (apologies for bad speeling and TMI!). My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant (first time) for about 7 months and it is starting to stress me out quite a lot, I've also had some recent work and family stressors. I've givien up meat, dairy, caffeine, artificial sweetners, alcohol to control my IBS but it still gets very bad with stress and very bad the week before and the week of my period. Now however it is still v. painful and the week after my period. My doctor recently put me back on both buscopan and mebervine (again, spelling?) antispasmodics which go some way towards making the condition OK for me to go about my daily business. I have mentioned to him that I'm trying for a baby but he's very dismissive (he was more interested 7 months ago but I guess maybe he has written off our chances too by now?). I'm 28, exercise plenty (when not in pain) and a healthy weight. My husband wants me to go back to the GP but I'm so tired of being fobbed off and I don't know if it's worth fighting if there's nothing anyone can do. I'm also not sure whether to stick with the medication or try and make do without it but be ill - because we have been trying so long unsuccessfully I'm loathe to stop trying now as the doctors won't see you for infertility unless you've been trying for a year. Is it worth bothering my GP?

"Hi all
I am a 35 year old female. I was diagnosed as having IBS last May. I had been suffering from what I had assumed was a reoccuring stomach bug. Roughly once a month, starting in February, for about 5 days I was feeling nauseous and having all sorts of trouble at the other end (mostly having many successful motions, of varying consistency, but still not feeling empty afterwards). I went to my doctor and after ignoring me for 2 minutes said ""you've got IBS"" and kicked me out of his office. He prescribed omeprazole and an antisickness drug. I wasn't convinced so I talked it through with the chemist who said the drugs wouldn't harm me, so I took them for a few weeks and felt much better.
After discussion with a friend of mine who has chronically bad IBS I started a food and exercise diary. I wasn't ill for the rest of the year so I stopped keeping the diary at Christmas. A few days ago the whole thing started again.
So, is my doctor right? I'm not convinced. From keeping a diary for 7 months I couldn't see any kind of pattern (admittly because the whole thing stopped once I started the diary). I eat fairly well, I exercise regularly, I'm fairly laid back so stress isn't an issue. Am I suffering from IBS?
Any comments gratefully recieved :-)

"After three spells in hospital with severe pain and two totally unnecessary operations, I was accused of being a hyphochondriac. When I was diagnosed three years later, having moved areas and doctors thank goodness, I was told I had IBS. The initial feeling was one of sheer relief that there was something wrong and I wasn't losing my mind. The second was one of sheer rage when I was patted on the head and told to ""stop worrying your little head about things, dear, and it will go away"" (the doctors actual words). Having changed doctors again I got to see a specialist who started to explain the whole story.
My IBS is also linked to food intolerance. The food intolerance I suffer from is all fo the food highly recommended to IBS sufferers - high fibre foods. I cannot eat wheat products (high regular levels of bran put me back in hospital), dried fruit, nuts: in fact, anything supposedly giving you the natural bulk you require.
I was so lucky five years ago when my husbands private medical plan paid for me to have full tests with one of the top specialists in my area. He confirmed my intolerance, and put me on a powder medicine called Movicol - a very very gentle drink which helps clear the bowel with no violent side-effects. It has totally changed my life.
I still can get really bad IBS symptoms: constipation leading to muzzy headedness, headaches, stomach cramps, bloating, tiredness but inability to sleep etc etc. I am also learning what causes it.
1. Stress - big time (surprise surprise).
2. Lack of exercise
3. Eating too many pre-prepared foods - microwave meals etc, and not enough fresh fruit and vegetables
4. Not enough sleep
5. Eating too much (big problem - I love my food!)
6. Eating too late at night
7. Caffeine (I now drink de-caffienated tea all the time and only have proper coffee about once a week)
One thing I have learned is that every IBS sufferer has a different story to tell, but there are ways to deal with it.
I still have a wonderful booklet given to me by the dietician I was referred to by my specialist. It lists all of the different forms of IBS, all the possible symptoms, and advises on the best things to eat and drink and what to avoid.
To any of you out there who are really suffering, my strongest advice to you is to push your doctor and make his life a misery until you are referred to a specialist, and also push him to see a professional dietician. Once you find a way of getting your gut under control, you will once again feel you can get your life under control. Then, even when you, or life's constant problems, cause you slip into it again, you have a chance of grasping control again.
Good luck to you all out there.

Started using Mebeverine earlier this week (as part of fybogel), and i must admit within hours the stomach cramps i was taking it for, went and havent returned.
BUT, yesterday i realised that all week i'd been having dizzy spells.. just a few seconds of disorientation and the room spinning etc. Yesterday was worse though.. complete feeling of unsteadiness and a thick head.
Spoke to the doctor who said fybogel wouldnt cause this, but i neglected to tell them it was combined with mebeverine (it was a different doc).
Anyway. I'm not going to take any more.. my last one was yesterday morning, although i still feel wrong today. Does this all sound normal?

It contains one billion live bacteria of the strain Bifidobacterium infantis 35624.
Apparently it was developed by Gastroenterologists.
You take one capsule a day with water, with or without food.

My problem now is that my stomach is always swollen, I have gained nearly a stone and a half in the last year, and I can't get rid of it. I put this down to the IBS. Has anyone else had this? Also in the last 3 months when it starts I start belching, the SMELL is disgusting. It is that unbearable I have to take the day off work. It smells like rotten eggs (or stink bombs as my kids say). It is really taking over my life. I have been to the doctors and had every test possible. But they can't explain the smell. Has anybody else had this? I would really appreciate some advice.

"Hi!
I have Consipation Predominant IBS and have recently been researching probiotics, hoping that maybe they might be of some help.
The basics I have come across is that the capsule supplement type is the ideal kind of probiotic, and that the bacteria should be in the billions.
It should contain a PREBIOTIC, FOS(Fructo-oligosaccharides) or INULIN.
If you are going to try a probiotic supplement most of the advice suggests giving it atleast a month to see if any positive results take affect.
I have never tried a capsule probiotic before. I found one I liked the look of and it is called PREBIO7. I brought it from boots and have been taking it for a few days.
You can take 1 or 2 capsules a day.
I will let you know if I find it helpful.
Anyone tried this? Or tried a useful probiotic?
Thanks.

I have not had quite enough of feeling tired, awful pain, headaches, no energy, nauseas, constipated, diarrhea, bloated, constant flatulence and stressed about all of above. I decided to go gluten and dairy free and that was 4 days ago. I will say desperate measures call for desperate times and I believe I've done the right thing. I know it won't be an overnight change to my body but with this lifestyle change I am starting to feel a bit more human and dare I say not uncomfortable all the time. It's not the easiest diet to follow as almost everything in the universe has wheat in it. But, after just the slightest relief I have had has given me the insentive to go all the way and be happy and whole again. I will say that my mum has crohns (stoma) and ulcerative colitis. Whether this makes a difference to me or not I don't know. Can I ask if anybody out there might be able to give me some advice as to whether I'll be able to get prescription food for my gluten free or would I have to have celiac disease? Also howcome have docs never said I have that although I haven't lost unexpected weight with my condition. Maybe it is just IBS A but gluten free does wonders for me.

"Hi everyone I am new to this (chat room). I am so encouraged by all your comments, they so mirror my experience with these symptoms. Untill 1999 I was fine ,my husband,son and myself holidayed in Feurterventura, Canary Islands. I had the holiday 'tummy' so took tablets but still didnt feel quite okay. Still enjoyed the holiday we were 'all inclusive 'so unlimited amounts of alcohol. After struggling to see the Millenium in we took a life changing decision to sell our family home and move up North where my Husbands roots are, we bought a NEWSAGENTS, which we ran succesfully for 5 years,during which my symptoms got really bad. My Mum and her brother , my uncle both had Colon cancer so I was a likely candidate. My then Doctor was brilliant orginised every test possible. Camera up and down ,I still dont know how they managed the one down I cant stand anything near the back of my throat I imediatley gag. Scans showed a large gall stone which was causing the upper abdominal pain and a few fybrods which were causing the lower abdominal cramps, so they say. 5 years on I'm still not convinced ,my main problem is the severe nausea I suffer every single day, yes I've tried every solution possible.It doesnt help that I have a complete phobia about being sick, always have always will.

Has anyone else noticed this pattern?
My GP said I could take the tablets when I felt the onset of pain but I'm not sure if that means just take them for that day or take them for the 10 day prescription. What do others do?
My GP did give me a very useful print out on IBS with all kinds of suggestions for what triggers it, managing the symptoms etc. which I'd recommend.

"Hi
I was on mebeverine for about 6 months and am unconvinced it had much impact on relieving my IBS symptoms; 3 months in of taking 3 tablets a day and I was still doubled over in pain with a hot water bottle on my abdomen and on one day a month I was even being sick with it. My doctor encouraged me to perservere but I couldn't understand why I would be experiencing such levels of pain if the tablets were actually working.
I have been off mebeverine for 2 weeks now, and although I was fine the first of those weeks, these last 7 days have seen a noticeable increase in the frequency and intensity of my stomach pain. Am wondering whether the mebeverine was actually working :roll: ! Although I am selling my house at the moment which I doubt is helping my stress levels so that could be something to do with it! :lol:
Anyway, I would like to know whether anyone can recommend any other medication that I might try before I consider going back to the mebeverine. My main symptom is pain in my lower right abdomen; I have mild alternating diahorra and constipation. I am thinking of trying Buscopan (can I buy this off the shelf/over the counter or do I need a prescription for this?) - any thoughts? Have tried peppermint tablets before but again difficult to assess whether they helped at all.
Thanks! :D

"I've been suffering from IBS for a year now, and am 16.
I have upset stomachs very regularly, often when i am out which makes it very embarrassing having to try and find a toilet. I am constantly worrying that i am going to need to go to the toilet and it's making me not want to go out as much. I take anti-diarrhoea tablets whenever i have a loose bowel movement, however this does not help the constant worry that i am going to have a bad day when i need to go, and may not be able to if there are no convenient toilets around. The urge to go comes on so quick, meaning i frantically have to find a suitable toilet, however am too embarassed to tell my friends which makes me panick even more! I often have to go home from college to go to the toilet, and i feel as if i am more reluctant to go out nowadays.
I really dont want to let IBS take over my life but it slowly is, and as i am so young i am really worried that i will have it for the rest of my life. Does anyone know if you can out grow it?
Also is it dangerous for me to be taking anti-diarrhoea tablets so often? If so is there something else i could take to help return my bowel movements to normal?
Has anyone tried IBS hypnosis?
I really am desperate for a cure, or at least something to help and reduce the discomfort, pain and embarassment.
Also, does anyone experience a sort of bubbling sensation in their lower abdomen before a bowel movement, when looking at my right abdomen literally moves up, as if it is contracting? Is this normal?
Any questions that are answered would be such a help!
Thank you.

"[color=indigo:271658ee8f][/color:271658ee8f] I have been taking these for only 3days now, (after being taken off Tramadol due to an allergic reaction) and because i have IBS the dr has given me laxatives to take with them too as he told me Dihydrocodeine can cause constipation.
I cant remember the last time where I have been in SO much pain with my IBS. Im getting sharp pains down my stomach, horrible upset stomachs, terrible stomach cramps, bloating and trapped air, and am unbelievably constipated.
Plus the pain that i was in with my back hasnt even eased at all, so Iv got more than id bargained for with these tablets.
Has anyone else had these problems? The pain im in is unbearable, i cant get comfy and am just in so much agony.
Someone please help!

"I have had IBS for approx 10 years.Tried changing diet, monitoring food intake etc. with little success. Lately my symptoms have become worse. Going on holiday I get anxious, have diarrhoea etc. also the main problem is wind, which seems to start in the bowel as bubbles and goes around the body, sometimes making me feel faint (not good when you are up in an aeroplane). This is relieved when I can go to the toilet, but can take some time to go away. I don't get too much pain, but do suffer from from bouts of diarrhoea without much warning. I do feel that my problems stem from anxiety and stress. Not having much joy with medication, but have started taking mebrevine, anyone else have these symptoms and tried this medication ?

"I have just been diagnosed with IBS and although I am relieved to know the root of my problem I am still concerned that Mebeverine may not be the right drug for me. My GP informed me that IBS is related heavily to Personality type, which would make sense because I've noticed that my IBS flares up in moments of stress. If that is the case though and my IBS is more related to my anxiety than my diet, will Mebeverine actually help.
I have changed my diet numerous times and nothing seems to change. As it stands, I have the most boring diet ever for fear of flaring my stomach up and if it wasn't for my love of cooking I think I would give up eating altogether!!
Would anyone be able to shed any light on this for me? I am desperate to just get on with my life and I feel that IBS is massively prohibiting me.

4 weeks after this i was feeling very very ill , and after much messing around my doctor eventually found it was C-diff . i was given metronidazole for 2 weeks which cleared up the c-diff.
however !!! i started to feel very ill after this had cleared. went back to the doctors and have been slowly going along the route of a gastroenteroligist . with suspected IBs .
i get swollen lower stomach, pain in my colon , pain in my kidneys , sometimes constipation and sometimes fine , no mucus thank god , but i can smell a definate odour which makes me sekf concious of myself .
the pain and discomfort is the worst for me .,

"Hi there everyone,
i was diagnosed with IBS a year ago, i got it after catching the rotavirus twice in the space of a few weeks. Since then i have been put on Mebeverine but it doesn't seem to help, it slows me down but the pain is still there. I'm at university, in my first year and i find myself crying all the time because i just want to be normal again.
I don't really know anyone with the same symptoms as me, i have a friend with IBS but she doesn't tend to have problems that often, maybe once a month, and she only gets constipation. I get both and i'm in pain every day, if i have loose stools i take mebeverine and within 2 days i'm constipated, so i take fybrogel and then.. well vicious circle. I'm sure there are many people reading this who identify, it would be really great if i could have a chat with someone about it. I know i have my family but they find it hard to understand when they have no problems at all.
Happy New Year everyone!

"My sister has bouts of diarrhoea especially after greasy food She cannot eat anything with gravy or a cream sauce,but as long as she avoided these she coped Ok .Recently however over the last 18 months,she has had recurrent bouts of upper abdominal pain ,usually coming on during the night. It is a constant pain whch sometime moves round to her back .It's not as acute as the pain of gallstones,we know this because our younger sister had to have her gall bladder removed a few years ago.She has also started getting symptoms of flatulence and bloating,and more embarrassingly for her,when she goes to the toilet,although her motions are a normal colour,when she wipes it's yellow,as if she has drunk orange juice. Can ayone help or throw any light on what this could be? She has an appointment next week with her GP She was prescribed Omeprazole earlier this year as she was taking aspirin for HBP, and the GP thought that was causing the pain,but she still had a bout of this colicky pain and stopped taking them.Its the yellow stuff after a bowel movement that she is really worried about now ,and I hope someone can throw some light as to what it could be

"I have IBS and have had for several years. I control it through diet (avoiding the things that set it off) and all has been fine. Suddenly 4 months ago I have terrible pain in my back in the kidney area on both sides (comes and goes) pain in both sides and front of my abdomen, bloating and I keep bringing up bile. The symptoms are everyday and much worse during my period. My gp has done LOADS of bloods, water samples etc and says it's all fine and it is my IBS, I feel that it isn't, however he has given me mebeverine and omeprazole to take. This is keeping the bloating and bile off but the back pain etc is no better. Has anyone any ideas? Could my IBS have got really bad and constant for no apparant reason? Or is my gp cluthing at straws because he can't find what's wrong? I'm in pain most days and quite scared!

"I have suffered with stomach problems for the last 6 years.Had my gall bladder removed in 2004 as it wasnt functioning properly.Then to my horror started to have symptoms the same again after about 6 months.Visited my gp who perscribed omeprazole, very shortly after fell pregnant and symptons subsided but then started having unexplained bouts of diarrohea.After the birth of my child i remained pain free until about six months ago i started having acid and reflux problems which i never treated or bothered to visit my gp for until one day i was doubled over in pain in a cold sweat and had to be taken to hospital by a paramedic when i arrived at hospital my blood pressure was very low which explained my feeling faint they gave me gaviscon and pain killers and after about a hour the pain went.I was discharged and told to visit my gp for some anti acids.After numerous blood tests which have all come back negative my doctor has diagnosed me with ibs.He has perscribed me 2 omeperazole a day for acid and mebeverine for stomach cramps which are both not making any difference whats so ever.I was wondering if anyone else could relate to this and share any off their experiences with me.

"Hello.
Really for the last 2 months I have been experiencing severe symptoms affecting my daily life.
It began with a bloated hard distended abdomen, making me look 6 months pregnant. Then came excruciating sharp pains in my lower tummy so bad I couldnt straighten up. This was relieved by going to the loo.
Then more recently have had awful painful cramps in my upper tummy under my ribs and I can actually feel the pains moving slowly down so that after crawling into bed with a gnawing 'caving' in pain in my 'actual' stomach ( the bit where food first enters) like someone has driven their fist in and is leaving it in there? Anyone id with this?
I crawl into bed and curl up in pain to try to sleep. by morning the bloatedness has gone but then develop sharp pains in my lower tummy, like I'm aware of the whole food journey!
I've noticed from food diary that bread is def a contributer to these pains so today went bread free and was in alot less pain!
Why would I develop a sudden intolerance to wheat? I'm 41 yrs old and its only been in past 2 months, but is following a major traumatic sad event.
I'd love to hear from anyone who can id with these symptoms!
Thanks

Hello.
I first began to develop symptoms of IBS about a month after my baby grandson was still born.
The sheer shock and pain off loss and concerns for my daughter seem to now have manifest themselves in a real physical form with this ibs.
Bloated rock hard stomach, making me look huge, very poor apetite, and feeling really full only on a few mouthfuls. :?:
My tummy hurts all over with general discomfort, ranging from the top of it under ribs to sometimes crippling pains low down doubling me over unable to stand up straight.
This was relieved by going to the loo.

"I have been reading peoples comments on IBS as I suffer from this as well. A few years ago I was going to the hospital for test on why I was losing weight and in so much pain in my stomach and diarrhior. I had every test imaginable still nothing. I felt like a hypocondriac. No one seemed to have any answers apart from possibly ibs. One day I suddenly had great pain in my right side doubling me over, then it stopped then started, this went on for about 4 hrs, I eventually went to the hospital where they thought I had appendicitus and decided to operate immediately, as I suffer with COPD I could not be put to sleep as there was no time to prepare my chest. I had an epidural as I lay there thinking hurry up and take appendics out and get rid of this pain I heard the Surgeon say God no wonder shes in pain. I thought great now what. It turns out that I was diagnosed with Diverticulitus. where the little sacs in the lower bowel get inflamed and infected and thus causing all the pain I had been having and the weight loss as no nutrients were going into my body properly with all the diarrhea. They were very suprised that noone had ever mentioned the disease to me when having all the test for chrohn etc. Thus if I had not been rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitus I would never had known and just listened to Drs saying its proberly just IBS. I get very bad flare up and can't put it down to anything particular. I'm always saying oh not again my bloody stomach is it ibs is it my divi, what have I eaten, am I too stressed. I haven't come up with a solution yet, I just try to take each day as it comes and go from there, very frustrating ideed, as you all realize. Going out making sure there are loos nearby, hungry should I eat or wait till i get home incase it starts my stomach and i need to fly to the loo. I am relieved to know what is wrong with me but at the same time it is increasing difficult to live with. So for anyone out there who is worried about tests being negative maybe you should mention diviticulitus to your Dr or hospital and see if there is a possibility you have that as well as ibs. Take care now. Marie

"Hello everyone!
After a few months of very unpredictable bowel movements I consulted my GP
I told her that I have been suffering from bloating, constipation, stomach growling, wind etc followed by a sudden urge to use the toilet at the most inconvenient of times (driving to work, in the pub etc)
She prescribed me Mebeverine tables & said it sounded like I had IBS
After taking these tables for the full course things were good for a few months until it flared up again. I have been back this week & have been prescribed “COLOFAC” which doesn’t appear to be working?
The symptoms this time are a lot like the first, coupled with a ‘warm’ sensation under my lower left rib and back ache just above my bum, surely this is not normal?
As she pointed out tests, or a camera wouldn’t specifically identify is as IBS but might be the route to take in the future.
My father was killed by my local hospital through neglect after having surgery for Bowel Cancer, so obviously this scares the hell out of me, more so as I am a 29 year old male
The first time I suffered this was due to the fact we were in court to do with the above & I put this down to severe anxiety, as the doctor did
There is no blood in my stools?
I have tried fruit, fibre to no avail & have not changed my diet or foods in the past 10 years?
I am puzlled?

I was diagnosed with a hiatus hernia ( which doesn't help ) but also was put on tablets called Zoton which stopped me producing acid in my stomach ( these really worked) however the bloatedness and spasms although not as frequent did not go away. I have been taking mebeverine for a few months now combined with the Zoton, excercise and a healthy eating lifestyle seems to have calmed the spasms down but the wind and bloatedness ( especially round my period) although less is still apparent. I seem to get attacks only when i am upset and nervous now.

"Hi everyone,
just need a bit of advice and you al seem to know your stuff so here goes.
it all started about 2 years ago. i was lay on my front on my bed talkin on the phone. I'd been experiencing an extreme pain in my lower right abdomen, near my hip bone. This had been happening on and off for a bout 2 days and was getting to the point that i couldnt cope. Id rang my dad for advice and whilst speakin to him i completly lost control of my bowel. strange enough already but then what made it even scarier was that i didnt know. I was only aware of this wen i absent-mindedy touched my bum and was greeted by slush! obviously the sheer disgust of it all set in first so after id gone about cleaning myself up and stopped the tears of embarasment i rang my docs to make an appointment. she saw me straight away and examined me. i was asked to lie down and wen i did she pushed, with her palm, into the area i told her i was gettin the pains. she saw my reaction and immediately called for an abulance. I was tool to hospital and stayed there for about a week. in this time i was nil by mouth as they were adament it was apendicitus and would be operating on me. I had an ultra sound scan ov my bowel, appendix, kidneys etc etc. this all showed nothing. they were stumped. i was discharged after a morning consultation with a doc in which he asked if i was still in pain. i said no, he said go home. Ive had many tests since. i've had a camera up and down, a balerium meal, countless ultrasounds, the list goes on. All the tests came bak clear apart from me having bacteria in my stomach (Helicobacter Pylori) for which i was treated for but told it wouldnt have caused my problems. I was finally diagnosed with IBS and prescribed Mebeverine. Needless to say i didnt, and stil havnt taken these tablets. I honestly thought theyd palmed me off with something to get rid of me. One doc even suggested i had an eating disorder when i explained the sick feeling i got all day long, and the fact then wen i smelt strong smells (nice or nasty) it made me sick. I believed IBS was the asthma of the bowel world. a 'we dont know wots up with you so we're guna tell u its this' type of thing. Reading through al your comments iam starting to think i was wrong. i just couldnt undastand how Irritable bowel could cause that intensity of pain and that amount of problems. my bowel was irritable it downright hated me, it had brought out the guns and was lookin for the kill.
I must add here that for as long as i can remember my stools have been diarrhoea, it sounds disgusting but a hard pooh means sumats up these days! i also suffer from wind especially at night and can be so painful its unreal. my toilet visits also get more frequent and more nasty wen iam stressed or down.
does this sound like IBS? should i start taking the mebeverine? does mebeverine help? wht foods are the general culprits? info info info please.
any help would be hugely appriciated
thanks xx

"Hello Everyone out there, I am a 71 year old woman and have suffered from attacks of IBS for the last 30 years, after a particularly bad stomach upset. Since then I have had frequent, early morning, sloppy bowel movements and awful wind. Going to work as a secretary was extremely worrying as my boss's routine was to call me in to his office for shorthand dictation for an hour, as soon as I got to work. In order to survive this, I made sure I visited the loo before leaving the house and took two teaspoonsful of Kaolin and Morphine mixture. This was my lifesaver and enabled me to live through the 'shorthand hour' without having to rush out to the loo. The kaolin solidifies the contents of the stomach and the morphine deals with the pain. Sadly, now owing to EU ruling this combination is no longer available. However, kaolin is still available from chemists. It's called Kaolin Mixture. Kaolin helps with diahhroea, but obviously may not be suitable for those who suffer constipation. Like many other people with IBS, my life has been one long embarrassment. I have a sensitive and nervous nature, which certainly makes symptoms worse. I have had sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy investigations. I cannot see that eating more fibre helps those with diahhroea. My GP told me to give up eating so much fruit and to eat white bread instead of wholemeal. This is not easy as I have always tried to eat a 'healthy' diet. During a recent attack of IBS I also felt strong waves of nausea. Does anyone else suffer nausea with their IBS? Now retired, i try not to attend any social functions or evenings with friends. I still take my dose of Kaolin (in water) before say a visit to the dentist. My good wishes to everyone out there suffering with this embarrassing illness, especially the youngsters. Let's hope that medical science will one day discover the true cause of this mysterious illness.

"I'm hoping someone might have a possible solution for me on this one.
About a month ago I had a really traumatic day with a family crisis which turned out to be not so critical but the day had already taken it's toll on me. I had diahorrea for a week (which I had never had with IBS before) and was given mebeverine which cleared that up after 2 tablets so I stopped taking them.
Ever since then I have been having constipation of sorts - I'm going to the loo every couple of days but only a very minimal amount so I;m not going anywhere near normal.
Works really busy so food wise I've started chopping and taking several pieces of fruit to work with me so that when I'm snacking I'm eating good stuff but the biggest problem I have is that I'm still eating the same amount as I normally do but it's not going anywhere and it's really getting me down now.
I've had some pains (and a heck of a lot of wind) in the last couple of days and so am taking an extra fibre supplement but can anyone tell me if me taking Normacol granules for a few days to clear out and start afresh would be worthwhile?
I have to say its a relief in itself to find this forum as whilst my hubby is very sympathetic and can obviously see the bloating there is nothing he can do to help and my parents worry too much for me to tell them whats going on, I have a mate who I can tell but she has a new baby so I don't want to burden her.
I've heard that the main trouble with IBS is that the more you worry about it the worse it gets and the worse it gets the more you worry and so on which is exactly what seems to be happening to me at the minute, when I went to the gym the other day the bloating disappeared and the pain subsided but the next morning it re-appeared so I was worrying about it again - I can't live at the gym!
Maybe I just need to wait until my holiday in 3 weeks to get it sorted again!

"I usually get an IBS attack (the diarrhea and feeling nauseous type) on the first couple of days on holiday. This has happened on a few occasions when I have been on a cruise. The ships all treated me in the same way - the nurse visited me in my cabin in the evening and gave me an injection in the bum of something called Promethazine Hydrochloride (Phenergan). I was told that it would block the signal to the brain that tells me I feel sick, it would make me feel drowsy, but I would wake up in the morning feeling marvellous. It certainly did the trick and I did indeed feel marvellous the next day. (Usually if I get one of these attacks I can feel sick for 2 or 3 days.)
I'm going to see my GP and see if I can get it in tablet form to take with me next time I go on holiday. Sometimes I think the worry that I will have an attack itself brings on the attack, and if I know there is something I can take that actually works, it will take the anxiety about travelling away.

I am now 23 and during the past year my IBS has almost become a part of everyday life, usually occuring worst before entering a sitution I feel stressed about. This would involve an upset stomach and a need to go to the toilet many times with diarrhoea. This would happen often when eating out, especially with people and places I am not familiar with. The past year has been rubbish and the help I recieved from my doctor has been innacurate and I now believe there is a global conspiracy to ply sufferers with drugs in order to mask the underlying problem (much like anti depressants).
It has become apparant to me that there is one cause - Stress, I have spent many hours researching IBS and I bet most of the people who have posted comments here are anxious people, more introvert than extrovert, worry about travelling and probably pick up viruses more often than 'normal' people! Often a problem in the back of your mind may be eating away at you, then the everyday stresses of life add to this and thus you get ill. I get really annoyed when people would tell me to 'just relax' thinking it was just a matter of flicking a switch and you would be relaxed. I am not an expert by any means but I am not prepared to sit around and wait for a cure - there will probably never be a cure. I found the best way to control IBS is to deal with the stress, talk to people - I have started to find doing this makes the problem sound ridiculous, and thus it becomes less of a problem. I am currently trying my hand at self hypnosis in order to control my subconscious mind (yes I know it sounds daft) and am considering other options. I am starting to focus on relaxing more and eventually I believe I will be able to control the problem fully.
In my opinion, people need to explore their problem and read case studies - A book from the IBS network was quite an interesting read. This site has been really useful and reading other peoples comments has helped me, personally I agree some foods exaggerate the problem (caffine, fizzy stuff - but I can have these fine when I am relaxed so these are definately not the cause). Try and get a good nights sleep and eat drink and use the toilet regular when you are relaxed. Its all in the mind. I really hope this inspires some people although I appreciate people may not agree with what I have said!

"Can somebody shed any light on weird side effects with this drug? I am very wary about taking prescription drugs as I do have a tendency to have very quick and severe reactions in the past to various things I have been given including anti-depressants where I developed jaundice. Doctors said it was a one in a million chance I developed it and that was after just two tablets! I have been suffering for some weeks with altered bowel habits, distended stomach and gas and stomach pains after eating and was starting to get me down because it has got to the stage where I don't eat to avoid the pain but I still look about 6 months pregnant, especially around my period time. I went to see GP yesterday who told me to take antacids like Gaviscon and would prescribe me something for pain and wind so gave me Mebervine Hydrochloride. I took the first one yesterday lunchtime and was watching TV when I noticed within the hour my vision was a bit blurry. I put it down to tiredness and hey presto my stomach felt tons better and I was gobsmacked at thow wuickly the tablets had worked. I thought it was to good to be true to be honest. I thought at last back to eating what I want yippee! Then that evening I felt very sort of drunk even though I hadnt been drinking and slurring my words and all of a sudden last night went mega mega tired and listless and \""floppy\"". Went to bed feeling like I was coming down with the flu with sweating and intermittent shivering and was burning up. Spent a very restless night tossing and turning and getting up for cold drinks etc and felt so rotten this morning that I could't even manage to get my son to school. I suddenly wondered if it was me reacting to the Mebervine and looked up on net and lo and behold other people experienced weird things on it. Now I feel really down because they seemed to work so well but these side effects are awful. I was not given the patient information leaflet with the tablets but my GP siad they were \""quite harmless\""! I am beginning to think I am just one of those people who cannot tolerate prescription drugs but the thought of living with these awful stomach problems are really getting me down. Help! - has anybody else persevered with them long enough for side effects to subside? Any help appreciated.

"i'm 16 and have started to think that i have IBS. for i think a year now, i have had excessive amount of wind. beginning of last year it was more a case of it happnening every couple of days, where i would need to fart again and again and would have to hold it in as it was embarrassing obviously. now i get it every day, at school i have to go about 5 times a day to the toilet. i've ended up making excuses about needing to leave the classroom just so i can go to the loo. then when i do go sometimes i get diarrheioa, sometimes i think im constpiated as i just cant go. it's got to the point that i dread every day as it creates embarassing situations and even after i've just been to the toilet, i need to go again not long after. please help, have i got IBS? it's really getting me down. i'm a vegetarian and dont know if that has anything to do with it even though i've been one since i was 7.

"I'm currently conducting an online study as part of my PhD research about what it is like to live with IBS and how people view their treatments.
I wonder if anyone here would like to take part ....... if so, I can return in a day or two and provide a direct URL link to the study (which hopefully is ok with the people that moderate this board).
Many thanks!

"I've been suffering with diarrhoea for nearly two months now, sometimes going to the toilet up to 10 times a day and have on 4 different occasions within the last 4 months passed blood although not a large amount. I also suffered with bloating, wind and groaning stomach noises although this has improved since cutting out dairy and wheat. I was diagnosed with IBS by my doctor and he prescribed Mebevenine which has had no effect and also to eliminate dairy and wheat, which has helped but i still suffer with the diarrhoea. Can anyone offer any advice? Is blood a known symptom of IBS?

"Was wondering if anyone can help me.
I have been suffering from painful stomach for a very long time now. Main pain is in the lower left part. Also get bloating, wind, constipation and sometimes diareoha but mostly constipation. Also general feeling of nausea and headaches.
I have been back and forth to the doctors and hospital several times and was told i had anal fissure which i was prescribed cream for to see if would help and was told my above symptoms we because of the fissure. At least 6 months on symptoms got worst and fissure still there, which i may need surgery to heal.
I think i may have IBS which the contipation part could have caused the fissure but am struggling to get my doctor to do any tests to find out if it is anything more serious and to see if it may be IBS.
Was wondering if anyone can help me and let me know how i can push for tests etc as this is really starting to affect my life and the stress of worrying what may be wrong with me is really taking its toll.
Any response would be greatly appreciated.

"I've suffered from IBS for over 30 years although I wasn't diagnosed until about 15 years ago when I was given a colonscopy and lots of other tests. After all the tests I was given mebeverine which has really made a difference. My son also seems to have the condition and mebeverine works for him too. I always wonder if it's hereditary or infectious since my father also had it. As well as suffering the usual symptoms I also suffer a lot of nausea - I'd be interested to know if other sufferers experience this symptom?

"I would like to pass some info on to you and get your thoughts on it. on Dec 23 2003 I had a colonoscopy, and in Jan 2004 all hell broke loose in my stomach. now I had never had any problems with my stomach, I always had good bowels movements, regular. now I am convinced that there was some damage done.
I have had two cat scans, a ultra sound blood work and a upper GI {ran a scope down to my stomach} nothing the Dr prescribed did any good so I stopped taking any medication, nor do I see the Dr. it is strange to me that all this started after I had the colonoscopy. the Dr did remove a polyp down about where my appendix were before it was removed back in 1990. so if it is not too much of a problem I would like your opinion on this
Thanks

"I've been suffering from IBS for over a year now and have now been told by my doctor that it is causing my bladder problems. I had been suffering from reoccuring cystitus and had some tests but was informed that this was just another downside to my IBS. Apparently the bowel sits on the bladder and can irritate it. One more thing to add to my IBS symptoms. I sympathise with anyone that suffers from it and have tried changing my diet, taking Aloe Vera juice etc etc but to no success. I think my main cause is stress but it becomes a vicious circle as I get stressed about the IBS and then the nightmare begins. I also find that it knocks confidence as I become scared to go out in case I become ill and my life revolves around my IBS and where I can and can't go. The way I look at it tho, is that it is not life threatening and there are people out there a lot worse off than me. I'll just keep the imodium in my bag!!

"I am 17 now and have been suffering from IBS since I was 12. Although i only found this out about a month ago! I suffer from severe abdominal pain,diaorhea, and I hardly ever eat and if I do its usually a packet of crisps because unfortunately they seem to be the only thing i can eat! I dont eat anything for breakfast I usually dont eat anything until about 1pm from getting up at 7am. And this is usually a packet of crisps and then I dont eat anything until about 6pm and usually never finish my dinner and thats me for the rest of the night! For example yesterday I had a packet of Quavers and a bottle of Powerade and 1pm. Then at 11pm I had a bowl of Bran Flakes this resulted in very severe diorhea! I think 65% of my IBS pains are due to anxiety and worry about getting these pains and only 35% of the pains are due to food!

Its starting to ruin my life I think! Im really worried about gettin a job my first one, in case i get too nervous or worried!
Its even embarrasing when someone asks me to go shopping in town with them because im too frightened! Last week one girl asked me and i admitted this by saying ""I dont really like going into town because of this IBS thing sorry!"" She replied by calling me a weirdo!
I started taking Mebeverine but these werent really strong enough so now Im taking Colofac and these dont seem to work either!
The worst thing i could eat is Pasta and Baked Beans and cereal and I used to love these! I now spend my life in front of the tv and in front of my computer which isnt normal for a 17 year old!
And i really would like to go to the gym with my friends but if i do exercise i get a stitch really fast and then this develops into sore stomach!
Well I im really glad iv wrote this because i cant talk to my family about this! Im very easily embarrased i have no confidence at all!
So i really hopes someone reads this! :D
