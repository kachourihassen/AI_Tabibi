"I am having problems with hitting my range of motion goal of 120. I am out 5 weeks from surgery and finally got to 103. The problem is during both physical therapy and home exercises, I struggle to get more than 5 degrees from my last measurement. It is very difficult to get more bend because it feels like my knee won't bend any further back. I have noticed my kneecap is numb on one side and the other side feels like twinges of electricity shooting through the side of my kneecap when I am stretching. I am taking both tramadol and oxycodone as directed but it has not helped with the stiffness during physical therapy. I do not have any noticeable swelling in my knee or feet but do ice and elevate. I can walk without my cane but do use it for support when I am out and about. Does anyone have any thoughts on what I can do different to meet my surgeon's expectations of getting to 120 degrees ROM?

"I've had 6 left knee surgeries dating back to original injury in 1980. Original injury included tears of ACL, MCL, and LCL . Injury occurred playing indoor volleyball in college. Have had 2 reconstructive surgeries, 2 scopes, a TKR in 2009 and a TKA revision in 2020. The TKA in 2020 included a gull wing osteotomy of my patella as it was too thin to accept normal re attachment process. I'm 65 and if it wasn't for my left knee I would still be doing normal activities and sports for my age. Because of the patella issues however, I have constant severe pain when trying to do anything that requires going up or down such as walking stairs or slopes or anything resembling a squat or getting up and down from seating. Forget sports activities...there are NO sports activities that I can do. I used to golf a lot, haven't golfed now in over 10 years, haven't been able to bowl for over 20 years. Any other sports or fitness activities are a remote memory. I've never been able to successfully rehab and strengthen surrounding muscles etc because of the terrible pain that accompanies and prevents that. I keep hoping for some new miracle cure that would allow me to replace the patella or ..whatever but, I guess I'm resigned to live with what I have. I've had 42 years to adjust to it so I am not in denial or anything...just wish there was something that could be done so I could do active things with my grandchildren. Any one have any miracle cures or solutions?

"Hello. I am a formerly active 71 year old woman. I have aced a hip replacement and 15 other surgeries over the years so am a good healer and not someone given to whining during recovery. However, the new knee has me beat. After a bad physio session that set me back four weeks, I decided to do my own rehab and have achieved full extension and a comfirtable 135 flexion. I ride my stationary bike twice a day and still do recommended stretches. So that's all good. The problem is swelling and pain on the outer side of the knee. If I walk too far, which is not much really, maybe 2500 steps, it feels like something is catching and makes continued walking, standing or lying in bed incredibly painful. I manage with Tylenol, and the odd couple of Tramadol at bedtime if its really bad. but I am running out of those. Right now I am not doing stairs, exercising hard or going out very much: my husband is making me rest. But I am panicking a bit because I am afraid of losjng my ROM. I don't want to regret doing this surgery and I know logically its early days. But I think I need a pep talk from people with experience. Also has anyone else had this painful catching in a very swollen post surgical knee?

"After the TKR, about a week, I began to experience a smell - not pleasant.  i thought I might have spilled something or the like.  Washed everything - including me.  But, there it was again-everywhere.
Come to find out that for a few of us the anesthesia (general or spinal) can result in causing an odor - and one that only we can smell- It's not our immagination, it's very real.  And, it can take weeks to months to go away  - time it takes for the liver to clear the chemicals.  Some people can even, unfortunately, taste it, too.

"Hi, just after some advice please.
I've recently had surgery on my right knee to correct a varus deformity. Ever since I've woken up from the operation, the foot underneath is numb and hyper sensitive with pins and needles constantly. The top of the foot is perfectly fine. I was told by the surgeon when i woke up that my tibia fractured during the process of the HTO but they managed to fix it. They mentioned my numbness is probably the foot block wearing off. But it's been 2 weeks now.
I also can point my toes towards me but I cannot curl my toes down at all but i can circle the foot all ok. Just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or any advice on what I could be if possible.
Many thanks

"Hi there.
I've read some of the posts here and found them helpful, thank you folks for posting!
My knee replacement is scheduled for this coming Monday, 4/4/22.
I've done quite a lot of research, but still feel unprepared.
I'm expecting pain, the need for a LOT of PT, and a Long recovery.
It seems like it's the surgery itself I'm having a problem with, but not in the typical sense.
The doctor plans on cutting the top of the knee and slicing the quad tendon.
I have asked about the quad sparing technique and her PA told me it's not used there because the visibility is not as good, and there is a higher risk of not having perfect alignment.
I've also been asking my prior doctor, who consulted my prior knee specialist, and they said they support the decision, both to do it and the technique planned.
When reading some of the posts here, someone mentioned ""Post-Op Depression"", the trigger being the removal of a part of your body (in my own words, a mini-amputation).
What I'm finding odd is I had very little trouble coping when getting a gastric sleeve, and gallbladder removal, but this is an issue. My head keeps asking, ""Do I really NEED this?"". Can't they just transplant cartilage, or use some other technique that isn't so dramatic and doesn't involve the removal of part of my knee? I'm already going through my head, ""It's really not that bad if I just don't go anywhere or do anything, and my life is pretty sedentary anyway, so really is this NECESSARY?""
Is anyone else going through, or have already gone through, this?
If there are any professionals on here, I can post the MRI results if that will help confirm what I'm having trouble dealing with, whether or not this is really a necessity.
I've even tried asking if at the level the wear is, what do other people go through?
I guess when I read the report, it looks like they should be able to salvage something and have better technique, but I'm not a medical expert.
Any thoughts?
Thank you very kindly. I hope you folks have a great day/eve.

"Hello, I am Lisa20011.
The blog I read had a lot of real life, useful, information...if anyone is still out there, here's my story
I had my right knee replaced 5 days ago -- had to stay in hospital because the anesthesia worked a little too well so I needed oxygen for a few extra hours... so, Tuesday early evening through Wednesday early afternoon at hospital.
On Wednesday morning my new knee made a weird, loud pop.
On Thursday morning I was walking with two canes, caught one, my upper leg wobbled a whole bunch on the lower leg ...in the new joint. I got swelling, red blotchy bruising, and pain.
Just before reading an old blog on this site today, I nearly fell down a full floor level of stairs-- when I put my second foot on the upper landing my knee did the joint wobble, I pushed my body against wall as hard as I could so didn't fall...yeah! My knee went from blotches of bruising to solid red all the way around the joint and below the big surgery bandage.
I'm back down stairs and just applied ice.
questions:
Should I contact my surgeon's office about the bruising?
No one is at the surgery today, it's Saturday...maybe they'll call back on Monday.
Is new joint wobble normal?
Thanks, Lisa

"basically, my knee is sitting off centre from where it should be. The physio basically strapped it and gave me a side step exercise plus strapped it. Then I go back next week to see how its going.
He said it's very possible that this is an old injury that I've had for a while and not known about it and now it's flared and gotten worse.
I may have heard this wrong but I think he may have said he wants to check how I'm walking and make sure I'm not flat-footed. how that affects knee Patello -femoral dysfunction.
I may have stuffed up when I answered the age-old question from 0-100% what are your chances of returning to work. I said 75-80% but my knee still feels very tight. I have to go back next Monday so it may change then. To be honest, though I'm just waiting to see if I get through until Friday. Currently, I'm meant to be doing full hrs (25) with light duties.
Basically, the best way to describe the current condition of my knee is very tight with the occasional pain in the knee. Currently on painkillers.
Questions:
Is it possible the strapping holding the knee in place could
be making it feel worse?
Could going to work while going through this injury on full hrs potentially aggravate it?
Has anyone been through this kind of injury before? How did it go?

"Just made it to the 4th month of a tkr on my left knee. I'm a 60 year old male who is very active and endured severe pain over the past couple years due to bone on bone. my recovery has gone exceptionally well and really only experienced a minor issue around the two month mark. The issue was with my IT band (also known as runners knee) on my left leg. My doctor said it was caused by my aggressive recovery routine in which I was back in the gym three weeks after surgery. After a shot of cordazone, I was back in the game. At my three month mark. I was back playing pickleball but at a scaled-down level. Because I was using weights , my muscle strength returned fairly quickly. Now at four months. I'm playing four times a week at a competitive level with no issues. What worked for me was doing something everyday with my knee. I also contributed my recovery to the use of a theragun muscle massager that I used daily. Waking up the leg/calf muscles was the key to my recovery without a doubt.

"Hi
I had a RTKR on 16th December and was really struggling with the bend due to a massive build up of scar tissue from this and previous surgeries. Therefore I had an MUA on Saturday.  Straight after the procedure the bend was fantastic and I went on the CPM and managed to get 110 degrees bend.  I was discharged the same day.
i woke up on Sunday with everything hurting and feeling very low and couldn't stop crying.  I am now struggling with getting my bend back, I seem to have gone backwards :-( My quad muscles are very tight and painful. I am persevering with my exercises every hour but I am getting very frustrated.  I have physio tonight and I am dreading it!
i asked the hospital if I could borrow a CPM machine but they don't let them out of the hospital.  I have researched if I can hire one but it's going to cost approx £250+ a week! 
Well..... That's me! Sorry it's a bit long-winded, I guess I just wanted to vent to somebody who totally understands and to possibly gain a little advice :-)
Thanks all

"I'm new to this site.
I'm 5 weeks post recovery from partial knee replacement. I thought I was doing really well, taking codeine and ibuprofen, I could manage to bend my knee quite well and carry out the physio excersises given to me. However after 4 weeks I stopped taking codeine and tried just taking paracetamol and ibuprofen, but this does not seem to give pain relief and the discomfort is getting me down.
obviously if I'm in pain, I feel reluctant to do physio, would it be normal to return back to taking codeine?
Has anyone else struggled with getting the right pain relief.

"Merry Christmas everyone!
I am helping someone who is nearing 80. He believes he has Meniscus Tear. However it has gotten worse.
He is scared of going for surgery due to COVID risk (yes, he is fully vaccinated, yet to take booster shot)
He is looking for solution where Surgeon can fix knee in his office.
So far we found
Repair of Meniscus tear. Can Doctor do this in office? Will Doctor even recommend sewing up the Meniscus because patient is old?
Partial removal of Meniscus. Can this be done in Doctor's office?
Complete removal of Meniscus. Can this be done in Doctor's office?
Patient loathes surgery. Some people say that torn meniscus may be manageable with 4 to 6 weeks of Physical therapy, but even he feels that the knee is so bad, that it needs surgery.
Patient does Recumbent bike and ices knee 1 to 2 times a day. And we saw some stretches/strengthening on YouTUBE, but still knee is paining.
Patient has high threshold for pain and intolerance (quit 35-years of smoking, cold turkey back in early 1990s), but this pain is too much.
We hear of Doctors who will push cortisone shots which may or may not work. Worse, we hear of Doctors who push unnecessary Surgeries just to make money (usually for their Hospitals).
Some people say that torn meniscus may be manageable with 4 to 6 weeks of Physical therapy, but
Please share your experiences and guidance.

I had a TKR of my right knee on 15th November at the ripe old age of 48, so coming up on 5 weeks now post op.
I'm getting really frustrated/worried about my progress as i still cannot lift my leg. Because of this limitation it makes some of the exercises pretty much impossible to do.
Some days i am really struggling with it mentally, as i feel i should be so much further on that i am. I can walk with one crutch, but am stepping into myself rather than taking strides. This is due to the lack of control/lift of my leg. Zooming around on two crutches is easy, and i've now perfected not whacking my ankles lol.
I guess i am curious if anyone else has experienced this, or should i be even more concerned than i am? i have my 6 week follow up next week.

"I'm in the UK. 4 years ago i had a TKR on left knee, 3 years ago right knee, same hospital, same surgeon. The left one has always caused me problems, i had to have it 'bent' twice under general anaesthetic to get over 100 bend. I've always been on diclofenac potassium as have arthritis elsewhere and it seems to have masked pain. I had anaemia and took me off all anti-inflammatories, after this suddenly hit by excrutiating pain in left knee. I've now found out the joint has moved, cement lose and i am having a TKR revision in December as I’ve been given faulty prosthesis. I am now suing for medical negligence as the National Joint Registry knew there was a problem with this joint in 2015 and still put it in to 100's of patients, unfortunately I've got two! With my surgeon I am the 12th one he's revising, there could be many more.

Noone prepares you for the sheer pain after, the sleepless nights & the loss of independence, but it does get easier! I still feel vulnerable, I'm worried about falling over, & lacking in confidence & I feel old & I'm NOT!! I wasn't prepared for the long recovery, my Consultant said 6-8 weeks - misleading, no way was I ready to go back to work, physically or mentally! Tips: I slept in leggings for 12 weeks as my knee was so sensitive to the sheets & I found that more comfortable & could apply ice packs more easily. Ibuprofen gel is my new best friend.

Whilst recovering from this I fell down about 6 steps and hurt my left knee, I had an MRI in January and went for the results yesterday, I now have 2 tears in my left knee and have been put on the waiting list to have another Arthroscopy in about 6 weeks time.
I am so fed up with problems with my knees as I just want to lead a normal life again, think work is starting to get fed up with the amount of time I've had off with knee problems!! I'm a staff nurse so it has a big impact on my daily working life.
So I just wondered am I free from tearing my meniscus again now I have a TKR or not?
Hope some one can help please?

"Hi folks,
I had my right knee replaced 18 days ago. I had my left replaced 5 and a half years ago. From day 1 of the first knee i xould bend my knee to 90.
This time so different...from day 1 I have found it very hard ro get the bend past 60 degrees. My physio while in hospital knew I was having difficulty and sent me home to keep trying and I am really struggling. With ly last knee i could use the skateboard to get movement but not this one, it is so stiff and tight. Has anyone any ideas?
Thank you

"Hi I'm a 69 year old male. I'm 9 weeks into my recovery. I have about 130 degrees of knee movement , and can easily walk 2/3 miles without a problem which I'm quite happy with but the constant pain and subsequent lack of sleep is wearing me down. There is a cyst formed behind my knee could this be responsible for the discomfort? My doctors told me that it would disburse naturally after 6 weeks however no sign of that yet.
For pain relief I am taking 2 paracetamol and 2 codeine 5 times a day. They don't seem to help much. Could it be that I have pushed myself too hard on the rehab that the pain is so bad.

"My mother did knee replacement surgery a month ago. After the surgery she was doing great for the first two weeks; She would walk the next day. After two weeks she didn't even need any pain medicines and started to walk well with a walker. But then one night when she moved herself from a chair to bed, she heard a few several loud clunking sounds from her knee and felt pain; the next day the pain got worse and she would not put any pressure on that leg and could not stand because of the pain. We visited her doctor and the doctor said it is normal to feel pain sometime and the pain will be going away soon. However it has been like that for almost 2 weeks now and the situation is not getting any better. She could barely stand now. Her physical therapist said this is not normal. We have an appointment scheduled in a few days. Does anyone have a similar experience or any suggestions what might be going on.

"Hi, I had a total knee replacement a week ago, and I'm very frustrated as I cant really bend my knee past about 35 degrees (I'm guessing this angle). I'm trying my hardest to get it going, but it wont bend without severe pain. I also can't lift my leg off the bed or chair without the use of a cord to help elevate it. I feel like I should be much further along than I am, based on what the physio's at the hospital were saying to me, and wondered if anyone else had experience of this and what they did about it. For general reference I'm 53 years old and generally fairly fit and healthy. This is so much worse than I imagined. Thanks in advance.

"I had total knee replacement 6 years ago. Although better than the pain I had beforehand it still had a little discomfort and I could not kneel on it.
I have just had my 2nd knee surgery 10th August 2021 I was ready for the initial pain which got less as time went on and I was doing Physio each day and walking with 2 crutches, then one, and around 8 weeks carefully walking without any support.
I am finding I am getting a bit low at moment I find it hard to get a full nights undisturbed sleep I settle on side with pillow then am woken because knee is stiff and painful. I get up early as both my knees are painful and I need to walk.
my newly operated knee . when I walk/physio it gets really worked and loosens up but after a while if I've rested it's so painful and stiff . If I sit for a coffee I have a real struggle to stand without it feeling very painful and ceased up.
Is anyone else like this. I am approx 11 weeks post-op

"Hi, all
7 months on after a gardening accident X-Rays and MRI scan show extensive damage to my knee. A phone consultation with an NHS surgeon indicated at least a 12 month wait for a TKR. I elected to go private for a TKR as the wait would be 2-3 months . The consultation with my chosen knee surgeon went well until he started describing possible side effects i.e. blood clots, infections etc but more alarming my age, Im 75 and was a reasonably fit 75 year old until the accident ,i.e. keeping fit country walking and exercise cycle sessions 5 times a week. Does any one think Im too old to take on this surgery, I`ve survived spinal surgery in the last 3 years ok. My life style is on hold at the moment.

"Little bit of background - 2018 had a skiing injury to my right knee, then went to Dr who sent me for physio, had physio for a year and worked really hard but not much change in support of the knee. COVID hit and everything go postponed but kept up with my physio. 2020 Finally got seen by a orthopedic surgeon who did some physical tests with me and said he was pretty sure it was a blown acl and miniscus damage and sent me for a MRI. MRI results came back nothing appeared torn but I had a enlarged fat pad and they booked me in for surgury. Long story short the date kept getting postponed due to covid and short staff.
Knee symptoms - felt like it's was always about to buckle, crunched and popped every step, constant dull pain inside the knee and always felt bruised. But didn't stop me from daily activities such as walking to work and swimming although it was constantly sore whether I was sitting or standing
So last week I finally had my knee arthroscopy surgury to shave down the fat pad behind my knee (hoffas fat pad) and the surgeon cleaned up the bone itself.
However it's been just on a week, and It has the fejng of hollowness and like its dislocated(like painfull numbness) I cant quite explain it...
I can walk with a limp and extent it straight with moderate pain, but if bend it slightly or sleep on it it feels like it's going to explode and that (hollow dislocated feeling)) I just feel like it's worse than before and it's never going to get better. I'm 26F and before 2018 was a very active sporty individual..
My follow up is around 5/6 weeks...
Has anyone got any information or been through somthjng similar?

"I have had chronic knee pain for almost 10 years I've had Drs look at it with ultrasounds and X-rays but they can't seem to find anything.
even after 7 months of physical therapy that didn't seem to help my knee either.
the type of pain my knee gives is it start off as a sharp pain between my kneecap and knee joint then progresses into a ache.
the pain progresses to the point where it starts to cause pain in my ankle.
what could my issue be if anybody has had the same issue.

"As per title: is this possible?
Background Info: I'm 37, male, with 4 past knee surgeries due to sport:
Right ACL Reconstruction (aged 25)
Right Arthroscopy (aged 25)
Right Arthroscopy (aged 26)
Left ACL Reconstruction (aged 29)
For most the past 7 years, I've been very active (play competitive tennis, competing in 5k races) in spite of my past knee surgeries. However over the past few months, my right knee has become a big problem in that only a small amount of exercise can cause it to balloon up and become very swollen and sore, to the extent where I can be having to hold onto the bannister in order to get down the stairs.
I made a doctor's appointment 3 months ago, got seen by a physio 6 weeks later who, after carrying out her own examination on the bed, said that she couldn't find anything wrong and that I didn't need referring for an MRI.
I'm not convinced at all. It just doesn't feel right and, having had the knee surgeries I've had in the past, I feel I'm quite a good judge of my knees i.e. I kind of know myself when something's not right with them.
My question is, as per the title, do private hospitals allow patients to have an MRI even when an NHS professional has said it isn't necessary. I'd quite happily pay a few hundred to get it properly looked at rather than ""be persistent"" with the NHS and potentially have to wait another month or 2 to see the physio again, only to be again told 'you don't need a scan' and to then be going round circles.

"Most Important...  Everyone heals at their own pace.  Don't judge yourself by anyone else's progress.  This is between you, your PT and your doc.
That being said...here are some ""ballpark"" estimates...
1. Medication...  Take your pain meds.  This is not a test of endurance.  Need 'em?  Take 'em.  Ballpark... Most people are off the the opioids in 4-6 weeks; some need them longer.  800mg Ibuprophin or Tramadol (both RX) after that if you need it.  The opioids will make you constipated and possibly dependent.  Nobody wants something highly addictive in their medicine cabinet; toss them as soon as you can.
2. Pain... A TKR is really, really, really, really painful...no getting around it...especially the first month.  Don't measure your pain levels daily...monthly is better as you'll see dramatic changes from the longer time span.  Ballpark... The worst of the pain will probably be gone within 90 days...but again, everyone's different.   
3. Assistance...  Crutches, walker, cane...whatever you need for as long as you need it.  Ballpark... Most people are off of all those items within 90 days but the sooner the better.  Gotta start to learn how to walk on your own again...sometimes, you have to push it. (NOTE: This may not apply to people with previous hip/knee/leg problems or to the elderly.)
4. Pysical Therapy...  Gotta do it.  Your therapist will work with you to both straighten and bend your knee.  Full range of motion is zero degrees straight and greater than 120 degrees bent ( 0 / +120 ).  I started at -14 / +84 and finished 9 weeks of PT at -1 / +128.  Ballpark...  Depending on age, previous conditions, individual circumstances, you should shoot for the full range of motion goal.  If you can't get there at PT (I was still one degree from straight), finish the work in the gym or therapy pool.  The closer you get the better...but again, everyone's different.  You should consult with your doc and PT.  Who wants to walk with a limp or a cane the rest of their life???
5. Exercise...  After PT, ya gotta rebuild the muscles in your leg, especially the quad.  Walking, swimming, stairs, whatever.  You have to rebuild your strength to support the knee.  Ballpark...  Since it's during and after PT, this work usually falls within the 3 to 6-month range for most people.  My daughter has been an ACSM- and ACE-certified personal trainer and graduate nutritionist for the past 16 years.  Her recommendation: Build endurance before strength.  Warm up on a bike for 30-45 minutes (set the seat high enough for full leg extension)...then do your stretches.  For your exercises, start with NO weight but perform 3-4 sets of 12-15 reps each until you are at ease with every exercise and are not tired out by them.  Use your good leg to stabilize yourself during the the exercise...don't use the good one to fake the reps.  The idea is to get the bad leg as strong as the good one before you fully exercise them together again or even isolate the bad leg for exercise.  Once you can't tell one leg from the other (feeling balanced and not relying on the good one), start adding weight...slowly....like 5 pounds at a time, again using the good leg to stabilize yourself.  Any pain, strain or swelling means you did too much too fast.  Back off...you'll eventually have equal strength in both legs.  PS: I guess people with BTKRs can do both legs together...I'd have to ask her.
6. Swelling...  This is the knee's way of telling you that you overdid it.  Back off, ice, elevation, rest.  Ballpark...  Everyone does this at one point or another.  Listen to and learn from your body.  Avoid pushing it too far.  There's a fine line between progressing and heading off the cliff.  Everyone has to find that sweet spot for themselves.
7. Sensations...  There will be numbness at the incision site.  Nerves have been cut.  Ballpark...  Crapshoot; normal feeling may come back or it may not.  Some people have an uncomfortable sensation of the knee rubbing against clothing or sheets.  Hint: Wrap the knee loosely with an Ace Bandage or buy a ""knee sleeve"" and slide it on over the knee.  Easy Fix.
8. Sciatica...  If you've never experienced this intense pain from your back, through your hip and then running down your leg, be thankful...be very, very thankful.  On occasion, the sacroiliac (SI) joint on one or both sides of your hip will lock up and pinch/inflame the sciatic nerve.  This happens because we change our gait to compensate for the knee pain.  In layman's terms, ""you threw your back out.""  Ballpark...  Some people get it, some don't...another crapshoot.  Possible solutions: steroid injections, Celebrex, Lyrica, 800mg Ibuprophin, chiropractic, therapy pool, accupuncture.  Whatever works; talk to your doc.  It's temporary but painful; cross your fingers and toes that you don't experience it.
9. For simple discomfort that doesn't need RX painkillers...  Aside from the standard OTC pain meds, here's a suggestion: Voltaren Gel (diclofenac) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation.  Voltaren is used to treat mild to moderate pain, or signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.  I use this almost every night; just rub it in.  Works in 10-15 minutes. RX only.  Get your MD to write a script for lots of tubes (I got five right out of the box.).  Checked with a few pharmacists about an OTC pain relieving cream...they all told me to get my doc to write a script for Voltaren.  Don't think about it; just do it.
10. Post-Op Depression...  No one..NO ONE...talks about this, not even the docs.  Found out the hard way when I had my hip replaced in 2009.  Hospital, rehab facility then home.  Started crying and couldn't stop for three days.  Called my MD cousin.  Told me that it was Post Operative Depression.  This is a KNOWN condition that occurs frequently in people who have had an operation that removed an original part of their body.  Not so bad for appendix, gallbladder, etc.  Moderate to severe for hips, knees, shoulders, etc.  Really bad for heart transplants, traumatic brain injury, etc.  For us, it's a definite possibility so be prepared.  Blown away for three days with the hip until I knew what it was.  Gone in 24 hours because I was now aware of it.  For the knee, I was totally prepared.  Kicked its butt.  Remember...this is a definite possibility so be prepared.  If you start feeling really sad and you're crying all the time post-op...now you know.  Get out of the house into some sunshine.  Take extra Vitamin D.  Eat healthy; hydrate.  Do not let this get to you and do not start anti-depressants.  This is a temporary condition.  Concentrate on pain management and rehab...PT and gym...endorphins do wonders in combatting depression.  Get on top of it, wrestle it to the ground and beat the everlovin' crap out of it.
11. Long Recovery...  That ""swollen look"", popping and clicking sounds, stiffness...all normal.  Ballpark...  All of this should resolve in 12-18 months...or maybe it won't.  Who the hell knows...I'm just thankful that I'm walking again and not in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.  Goal...get back on my skates again.  After 44 years playing hockey, it's been too long.  I'll never play the sport again but just skating would be soooooo great.  Just have to see what happens.
12. Goals...  This is easy.  SHORT TERM (3-4 months): Get off the opioid pain meds; switch to non-addictive pain killers if you need them.  Use the Voltaren Gel.  Go to PT and get your full range of motion back (0 / +120).  Toss your walking aids.  MID-TERM (4-12 months): Rebuild your leg and core strength.  Complete any range of motion therapy/exercises so you are walking normally, especially up and down stairs.  Start adding close-to-normal activities, like walking a mile every day if that was your ""thing"".  Begin with a lesser distance and increase without any knee swelling.  LONG TERM (12-18 months and beyond): Set realistic goals for leading a fully normal life again...as if the TKR had never happened.  However, there may be activities that you once did and must now avoid.  For me, I can skate but not play competitive hockey ever again.  For others, running may be bad because of impact issues while speed walking might be a good substitute.  There are plenty of on-line resources that list OK, possible and ""never again"" activities for people with knee and hip replacements.  Your doc will probably have his/her own ideas but this is from The Mayo Clinic: ""After you've recovered, you can enjoy a variety of low-impact activities, such as walking, swimming, golfing or biking. But you should avoid higher impact activities — such as jogging, skiing, tennis and sports that involve contact or jumping. Talk to your doctor about your limitations.""  I saw one site that listed singles tennis as a no-no but doubles was OK becuse there was less movement and impact.  It's all very individual but the ultimate goal is to lead a healthy, active, productive life again...a far cry from lying in bed in utter pain one week post-op.
Did I miss anything?

"I tore my ACL for the first time in 2009 playing high school basketball. First ACL reconstruction in 2010 (patellar graft). It was unfortunate that I was so stupid back then and I believe I tore the new graft only 3 months out of the surgery fooling around with friends. Deeply regret this. 
Had my 2nd reconstruction in the summer of 2011 (allograft). This time, my ACL lasted 9 months; it was re-ruptured while hyperextending and landing awkwardly from a jump. 
3rd reconstruction at the end of 2012: I chose to go to a different, more well-known surgeon (allograft). This time, the graft lasted over 3 years. I only retore it a couple weeks ago basically running in a straight line. My muscles must have been tired or something to react properly when trying to slow down. Don't know whether I should even try for a 4th reconstruction at this point...my legs are strong and don't suffer from as much instability as some other people do when missing an ACL. At this point I'm looking for opinions from anyone. Feel free to give your advice. Thanks

I have had both hips replaced in 2012 . I recently developed severe back pain and had nerve block/ steroid injections 2 weeks ago which has worked , the OS also X-rayed my knees as wanted to see how bad my OA now was as though my lack of knee flexation causing back problems.
The end result he has referred me to a knee OS , for treatment options , I am 58 and do not want, if I can help it to go through knee replacements , I have looked at various options and have seen mention of various injections , the ones that seems to give the most long term relief are hyaluronic acid knee injections. I was wondering if anyone has had them and would they be of benefit if bone on bone ??

"Hi, I would appreciate if any orthopedic surgeons or anyone knowledgeable in this matter could give me a second opinion:
History:
I'm a 31-year-old male of east-Mediterranean descent.
Completely healthy, no medications/allergies, never had alcohol.
Never been seriously ill. Do not smoke, eat fairly healthy foods but regular sweets.
Have always been slightly overweight (varying between 5-15 kg) since childhood.
Family history of joint disease such as: joint pain and deformity (hip joints) in relatives, direct family (siblings and parent) with multiple herniated discs (neck and lumbar).
I have chronic muscular neck pain from sitting, working with screens and working a profession that is very taxing on neck and shoulders.
Chief complaint:
I noticed growing up that I developed genu valgum/knock knees during teenage years, but never had problems and didn't think any of it. I estimate approximately 5 cm distance between ankles when I force my knees together. It is also very visible when standing both with and without pants. This bothers me slightly.
I also noticed that I subconsciously started to compensate for my misalignment by only standing on the outside of my soles and rotating my knees outward. I do this till this day, even when I sit. I never stand/sit with my feet and knees straight or on my entire soles as it is very uncomfortable.
In the last 5 or so years, I've been starting to feel pressure/strain/mild pain on the inside and backside of my knees, especially when standing extended periods of time or exerting my knees in certain angles.
I don't have major issues now, and I believe the discomfort I have can improve with exercise and getting into better shape.
I am however worried long-term of joint degeneration and possible need of joint replacement. These I want to avoid.
Based on the above history, could anyone estimate my long-term risk of joint degeneration of any kind and need of extensive treatment such as joint replacement?
Would anyone recommend corrective surgery now for prevention?
I am considering it, but want to weigh the risk of degeneration against possibly losing function from major surgery.
Thanks in advance.

"24M, No Alcohol or Recreation Drug use. Currently on Pantoprazole, Famotidine, Symbicort, Proair PRN.
Chief Complaint: Left Knee Pain
Medical hx: Acid Reflex, GERD, Arthritis in both knees.
Arthritis Flare Up only in the winter time when it gets extremely cold, and the flare up only lasts 2 to 3 days. I normally just take Tylenol as needed and never really needed much medical attention for my knee or arthritis condition.
On 09/01/2021 I injured my left knee at work. I didn’t fall and I didn’t hit my leg, while I was lifting heavy items in a variety of different chutes my knee became extremely painful, and started to audible pop, and click.
My work is very physical and I am constantly squatting, twisting, bending. On 09/03/2021 I go to the orthopedic and they tell me that I have Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. The doctor only presses on the knee to determine where the pain is but no imaging, no X-rays, no mri’s are taken of the knee. They tell me that it is a pain flare up. I explained to them that I don’t think it is a pain flare up because typically my arthritis flare up will only come for 2 to 3 days total and then complete disappear and I also said that the flare ups from arthritis only come during the winter time during frigid temperatures, I live in Minnesota so our Winters are Brutal. The doctor still just told me that it is Patellofemoral pain syndrome and doesn’t do any diagnostic testing. He told me to buy my own brace and refuses to give me a knee brace. He also told me to just complete a few weeks of physical therapy. He also put me on lifting restrictions where I can not lift more then 10 pounds and I have to do light and sedentary work. My work is unable to accommodate so they put me on a unpaid leave of absence. I have been using ice, bio freeze.
For the last week I have been in constant pain. No matter what position my knee is in the pain is constant. The pain gets worst with bending, walking up and down stairs, and squatting. Over the last week my knee also hurts when lying in bed. This is not normal and not typical. My knee also has an constant audible popping and clicking when walking up and down stairs or when squatting. The pain also radiates down the leg from the patella.
Since this is not my normal and since the doctor wanted me to follow up with him, tonight I had a follow up appointment, i explained to the doctor that this is not a typical flare up and that no body can tell me how my body feels and that I am the only one who knows my body the best and that I know when something is not normal with my body. I told the doctor that the pain is still present and that the pain is worst and that I can’t even sleep on my stomach because the pain from the bed would cause too much pain on the knee. I told him that the pain is not normal for me, he then just told me oh you are still have pain flare ups and that you need to stay on your restrictions and continue physical therapy. Again no diagnostic testing is done and the only thing that he does is put pressure on my knee to see me grimace and see my pain reactions. I am just frustrated because I feel like my orthopedic is not listening to me. What do you recommend that I do? I am frustrated because I want to know why diagnostic testing isn’t being done. I get it I didn’t fall and I didn’t hit my knee but there are cartilage injuries and other injuries (ACL tear, Meniscus tear, etc) that can happen. Can someone please provide some insight into this?

"Hi
Had a PLC reconstruction using the Larson technique about 14 weeks ago. Woke from op with terrible hamstring pain in the leg with reconstruction (despite graft coming from the other leg). That pain has started to fade, and was apparently related to the tourniquet.
Post op from hospital I was given crutches, no brace and no compression. I was encouraged to do full weight bearing exercises week 2, and walk without crutches week 3.
I'm still in really bad pain at the top of the fibula and where the hamstring tendons are at the lateral side of the operated leg. Have had to stop any quad or hamstring exercises because of it. Anyone else had similar.?
Most rehab protocols I've read for Plc reconstructions limit exercise and weight bearing for 6 weeks but I'm not sure if that's out of date now.
It would be nice to know this pain is normal and should get better.

"I had my right knee replaced in 2006 and my left in 2008, Both replacements have been very successful and I haven't had any problems until lately. My right knee, which had the greatest workout because I was 12 weeks non-weight baring after a foot operation on my left foot in 2008 ( three months after the left total knee) Suddenly I am having a great deal of pain and some swelling in that first knee.

I know it will be at least as long a recovery as the original TKR. I'm getting the idea from some of what I'm reading that it may be a bit worse. I was 53 when I had the first. Now at 68, I'm not ready to slow down!

"i need to have knee replacement. My concern is how long it will take me to be able to be back up on my feet. I live alone in an apartment, and have a dog which needs to go outside several times a day. I don't have anyone to help me afterwards. I can board my dog for a week or so, but will I be able to take him out regularly after that? Believe it or not, that's the only thing keeping me from scheduling the surgery. Any advice appreciated!

"I am 9 weeks post rt tkr. Reading these posts brings me some comfort, seeing that I am not struggling alone. My progress has been hampered by sciatic nerve irritation among other things. I still cant get to 0 or even 5 degrees extension and I'm afraid that MUA will be my only option. My surgeon doesnt even discuss sciatica... its like he thinks Im making up something. He said he fully extended the leg while I was under and theres no reason I cant do it now. I feel like I made some bad decisions... 1. Sure I had pain before surgery, but now my comfort level and quality of life are awful. I should have lived with my own natural knee. 2 I should have picked a different surgeon. This guy just likes doing surgery but has no time for the patient. Why was I such a fool? If anyone has gone through the mua procedure, Id love your perspectives. Thanks for listening.

"I'm 22 and this has been happening since I was a teenager.
Sometimes my knees will randomly give out while I'm walking. People who know me well are used to me randomly collapsing or stumbling for a second. I don't experience any sort of pain in my knees. I also usually have the same issue when I sneeze while standing.
Someone told me it might be because I lock my knees too much (I'm pigeon toed and stand weird sometimes) and I'm also very thin so I think it doesn't help that I don't have a lot of leg muscle.
I never went to a doctor for it because it's never caused me problems and I don't feel pain from it. Honestly, I know I should. Could this possibly be a sign of a bigger issue I've been ignoring?

"i had a tkr including resurfacing of the kneecap 4 months ago and surgeon was pleased with the X-ray result at my 6 week check. I am a fit 61 year old lady, the knee replacement was needed because of damage after many years of long distance running. The scar is neat and although pain at night has gone, I am still in a lot of pain when walking /standing for any length of time, and still need some pain medication. This is deeply frustrating for me, as I had hoped to be in less pain by now!  My ROM is good and pain eases when I sit. I use a stationary bike and do some exercises every day for quad strengthening.
Is it normal to be in such pain when walking after 16 weeks? My bones are weak and I take meds for osteoporosis, so was wondering if this may be a factor. Any ideas welcome?

"I had a recent knee replacement the first of June. I have been on Hydrocodon for over six weeks though during that time I cut the pills down myself from four a day to two, one at night before bed and one in the morning and that seemed to work for me with hardly any daytime pain. However, when I went for my second post visit to my Dr on 7th week he wanted me to go cold turkey to get off the meds trying Tylenol at night and ibuprofen in the morning. I tried that one day and pain was awful, worse at night of course. So, I have been trying to cut down to 1 half of pill twice a day. It helps a little but not much. I have enough pills for a couple more weeks if I half them. My question is, is it normal to be in this much pain, and should I be by not taking the pills?I had home health care for a month and the nurse told me to always get a handle on my pain. Going cold turkey and taking less meds doesn't seem to be the answer to that. I realize I need to wean myself off pills and I am trying, I also ice several times a day, do my stretching exercises and ride my stationery bike twice a day. I would appreciate helpful hints and comments. Thank you in advance.

"Living along is hard following major surgery. The recommendation to have the spinal injection was great advice as recovery was much quicker. Also, I had staples would go for those over stitches anytime. I coped pretty well and weaned myself off the heavy pain killers a little too early, my decision. I managed OK though. with Naproxen and Paracetamol.
I was left with ankle and foot pain following the operation which has been quite bad, but especially in bed when relaxed. I was sent, by my GP, to a special podiatry clinic nearby and was fitted with special insoles for my shoes. These took about 3 weeks to arrive but seem to do the job pretty well. They also help with low back pain I had when walking. The podiatrist explained that during the surgery your femur and tibia are obviously put under stress and could have moved slightly making the ankle and foot painful. The 3/4 insoles were for plantar fascilitis and they do help.
I was impressed that a mere insole could make such a difference. These are sold on Amazon but beware of the ones you buy. I had mine made for me on the NHS and if I wanted a second pair from them the price was prohibitive, hence Amazon coming to the rescue for other shoes.
The ones I bought were by RooRuns Orthotic insoles and are leather.
It does get better, so hang in there, I live in a first floor flat with no lift and believe it or not the stairs were the least of my problems. Six weeks ago the physio told me to stop all exercises and do things normally, walk, up/down stairs and I was much better following this advice.
All of you get better quickly.

"Hi to everyone.
I was told a couple of days ago that I will be getting a partial knee replacement in my right knee. Although the arthritis appears to be at the same stage in both knees, it is the right that is causing me the most grief. The consultant explained the differences to total knee replacement with regard to recovery, pain relief etc, but I would love to hear from people who have gone through this procedure and recovery so that I can be better prepared for what lies ahead. I am 59 and I work in a warehouse driving different forklifts and generally being on my feet all day. I enjoy my job but I am off at the moment because the pain is too much. The physiotherapist from my gp practice has given me exercises which I do every day and he says they will also benefit me after surgery. I would love to hear from anyone with advice, tips, or their personal stories that might help me. In the meantime I'll read through a few more posts on this lovely site.
Thank you very much in advance.

"I had a knee replacement March 18th.
After my first 2 Pt appointments I had blood in the bandages. I went back to my surgeon and he took the bandages off and looked at my knee. He did not think it was infected but it was definitely not happy. He put me in a brace and on antibiotics. With in a couple of days I ended up in the hospital with an infection. Spent 11 days in the Hospital and underwent several surgeries to clean out the area. After finally getting home I spent the next the next month or so healing the wound over my knee. Then I had a skin graft Taking skin from my thigh to put over my knee.After that healed for a month or so I finally had the brace taken off. I just underwent a knee manipulation And my surgeon was only able to get me to 60 degrees of flexion or bend. I have been able to get back to 50 degrees of bend so far. In addition to PT i am on a knee bending machine for 2 hours every 2 hours all day long. I am having manual work done on my knee daily to try to break through some of this scar tissue. It has been 4 months since my knee replacement. Has anyone experienced anything similar and found anything to help make improvements with the this kind of deep scar tissue? Kim

"I know some people suffer with thigh pain after a TKR . . and I wonder how many of them actually end up with this permanently?  At the moment, the pain in my thigh usually starts about ten minutes after lying down, and then wakes me in the night with excruciating pain which literally makes me scream and tremble.  It feels as if someone is ripping the leg apart with a burning knife.  Strangely, though, during the day it just feels a bit sore to touch and stiff.  I'm worried that this nerve pain will be permanent.  since day three of the operation, I've only been given paraacetamol for the pain, and I've really reached the end of my tether and been reduced to a trembling wreck by this pain.  I had the operation a month ago, and although the walking and general moving around is better, the pain is infinitesimally worse . . any hope for the future?

Was referred to a new physio two months ago who said one leg was definitely longer than the other which is causing my back, right knee and ankle pain and the muscles running the length of the front of my left knee are still too tight despite doing physio from day one until now! Am waiting for an appointment with Orthotics for a shoe insert.
Any suggestions to help my knee feel more normal are welcome, please.

"I just had PTN Medial side.
I don't have any arthritis in my knees and only have cartilage damage from some unknown injury when I was very on the medial side.
I suffered for 40+ years until I finally found a doctor that would do an MRI at 50. I went to a knee specialist and he ended up doing micro-fracture surgery on that knee and for the last 10 years I have been more active since my teens. I took up tennis and became very good at it.
Unfortunately, the microfracture surgery wore out after 10 years. Now at 60, my knee doctor recommended and did PTR on that medial side 10 days ago. He said I now have the knees of a 20 year old and will be able to resume full activity once healed up.
The knee doctor I went to has done 10,000 + FNR and PNR surgeries and is considered one of the best in the Midwest.
Anyway, while recovering I am doing some googling and came across an article at the Harvard Health site. I found this part quite disturbing:
**Aren't there partial knee replacements that involve only one side of the knee?
Yes, and they are easier to recover from. It is the perfect operation for the 85-year-old who only has a problem in one portion of his or her knee and minimal deformity. The worst candidates for partial knee replacements are the people who often get them — young athletic people. They recover fast. They feel normal. And then they end up loosening their partial replacement in no time.**
At 60, I am not young but with two good knees the past 10 years I finally could be athletic without a puffed up and painful right knee.
I am worried that maybe I won't be able to resume playing tennis again. My doctor even said running would be ok so, not sure what to believe.
Anyone have PTR and able to start doing things like tennis, mountain biking, skiing etc...?
10 days in and still mostly needing a walker. My doc said in 5 days I should be able to walk on it so he was already wrong on that.
It seems this forum is quite slow nowadays, but if anyone has feedback that would be great.

"I had a half knee replacement in February this year. All went well but I struggled to get it to bend. My surgeon and physio kept telling me ' it will come'. Sadly it never did and reluctantly he performed an MUA (manipulation under anaesthetic) where they did find a restriction. I am now four months post knee replacement and one month post MUA. I have the bend but the pain is worse than my pre op pain. I am still doing physio, trying to keep my weight down and walking (which is really painful). On bad days I have to take Codeine and at night I take Codeine as it's so uncomfortable. My surgeon says this is not unusual and it can take 12-18 months until it's right.

The last X-rays showed deterioration of my right knee cap also (perhaps should have had TKR instead). I fell over a couple of weeks ago and I think I landed on my knees, everything seemed ok until 6 days later and I could hardly move my right knee for the pain. It felt as if there were bones out of place and there was a lot of cracking and crunching, eventually after a good night sleep it seemed a lot better but I am still getting a lot of pain, mostly at the back of my knee but other parts of the knee aswell and a lot more pain in the left knee. Do you think I have damaged the implant or just the arthritic bones around it? Don't really want to see consultant about it as he will be annoyed that I have damaged it so near to being done.

"Hi all,
I am now 5 months post op after having a Patellofemoral Joint Replacement. Despite being young and fit, I made slow progress at first and had awful pain. After the 8 week mark I felt I was making decent progress and by the 14 week mark had achieved full ROM, although i was still experiencing a lot of discomfort rather than severe pain in the knee (it felt like there was something tight and pushing up under the bottom of the knee - i liken it to having the edge of a shovel digging up there). At the end of August i was however managing quite long walks (up to 5 miles) on fairly steep hills despite this discomfort . Nevertheless, I never reached a point where it was less painful than before the op.
Since returning to my job as a secondary school teacher in September, everything has gone wrong and i have gone significantly backwards. Yes, I have full ROM, but the pain and discomfort has escalated significantly. The 'shovel blade' sensation is way worse and I have terrible catching and snagging of the ligaments below the knee into the calf that make me gasp in pain each time they 'snag'. There is also a sharp, quite pointed lump on the top of my tibia at the lower knee joint which seems to have appeared in the past 6 weeks. I often have a lot of pain here. There is also a great deal of pain on the outer side of the knee and an area which is painful to light pressure (feels bruised) at the top of the knee above the kneecap. The back of my knee experiences painful twinges and seems constantly swollen. I can feel strange movements and popping in my knee and the whole knee still feels tender.
I am so frustrated because i am back to limping badly, taking painkillers and and don't feel able to do any of the walking that i love. It is more painful than it was at the 3 month mark and definitely more painful than it was before i had the op. I feel i have totally ruined my life by opting to have this op. Before it, I was still managing to climb mountains and even jog, even though i had no cartilage left at all, but that is totally out of the question for me now. I keep rerunning in my head the day the surgeon said 'Ok, so are you sure this is what you want?' and I feel physically sick that i said 'yes'.
I realise my job is demanding as i am on my feet all day but I have to go to work and i don't see how i can have regressed so badly and feel something is wrong and this is a failed op. My mum had a TKR age 70 and she was pain free by the 5 month point. My neighbour is 12 years older than me and had a double TKR just 4 months before me and he has been pain free for several months and is delighted. Why am i not feeling that and only had a PKR??
I have been to my GP and am waiting to see a surgeon (who, by the way I have not seen since the day of my op and only have seen his registrar once for a five minute checkup since the op). I am terrified I will have to go through the hell of the op all over again, or even worse, be stick with this current hell for the rest of my life.
This operation was sold to me as something that would give me more of my life back, not take it away. The surgeon was a highly respected one and i trusted him. I feel angry and depressed. I am currently so depressed i haven't got out of bed today and have spent it crying. This isn't good for me or my family (i have two children age 10 and 12) and they are scared by me crying all the time.
My partner doesn't 'do' emotions and offers me no emotional support or empathy and just gets stressed by my stress. I feel in a terrible place right now and feel it's all self-inflicted because I said yes to the operation.
Sorry for this offloading (i expect most have dropped out with boredom by now!) but I feel very desperate and writing this has at least been a bit cathartic.

I suffer from pretty high anxiety and depression also, so my ups and downs are frequent. I worry all the time I am not doing enough or not doing properly.
I was very out of shape physically, prior to the surgery. Also, overweight. I had dealt with the bad knee pain for over a year and a half and have back issues also. I sit and work 8 hrs a day. My physical activity was basically pretty null and void for over 2 years prior to TKR
My stamina is awful! I fatigue very quickly. I wish I could help it, but I can't. My PT works with me 3 times a week and now, down to 2 times a week.
I do my exercises in between but not 3 times a day. I am lucky to get through them once a day, and I am faithful to those I do, that 1 time a day.
My sleep has been awful. Awake every hour on the hour, just about, for about 4 weeks. Just now, able to get 4-5 consecutive hours sleep! Trouble with awful constipation due to oxicodone so quit pain meds completely, except for Extra Strength Tylenol, 2 days after coming home from hospital. Finally after about 4 days or so, I realized I had to have something stronger and called Dr and was given hydrocodone and it has been ok for me, but take very little of it as afraid of addiction.
I am sorry for the length of this post, but it just started pouring out of me!
I guess I just needed to vent to some others that really know what I am dealing with! I worry so.
I do have a question....Are you all walking, like exercise walking, out of the home? I walk around the house when I get up and down, but have not ventured outside. I have been scared. I can go up and down my stairs and did walk to the end of my drive twice but was so exhausted, I could hardly function, and, it was not far at all! I have done no more continuous walking like that. I have no stamina whatsoever. Is everyone else exercise walking, like up and down the street? Should I be? Is basic exercise walking necessary with all the exercises? How are you all handling this?
Again, so sorry for venting so much!

"HI
i had a tkr on 12/01 and still have a lot of pain and taking my analgesia regularly. The pain is mainly in the back of my knee now when weight bearing and a little under my knee cap. I find it difficult walking downstairs leading with my non tkr leg but can go upstairs consecutively. Does anyone else suffer pain in back of knee, is this normal? I'm beginning to think my knee will never be normal again.I just want to wake up in the morning and find that all the pain's gone and i can walk normal.

"I had totally replacement on April 28th this is now May 30th and I feel that I am not doing well at all. the surgery was fine the therapy is good my range is about 125 if not 130 that is not the issue. it's everything else that I'm dealing with. they gave me too many narcotics I came down off too fast, my choice because I couldn't stand it anymore. the appetite is gone I was barely eating 500 calories a day anything I put to my mouth it's like nauseates me it's terrible. I have no saliva very bad issues with constipation but that might be straightened out. I'm just wondering how many people out there can't eat can't sleep are very weak have no energy and it's just an absolutely horrible experience that I'm going through right now. I'm not depressed but I'm very close to it. I can't take antidepressants and I don't want any more drugs in my system. forgot to mention that I've also had a UTI after the 5 days after the surgery and it took three different antibiotics to get the infection out of my system. and we all know what that does to your whole digestive system. I just believe that I was not giving enough information prior to surgery as to other things that could happen in regard to it. I'm slowly learning I'm not alone.

"Hello,
I'm having some stability problems 18 months after surgery. My original surgeon suggested a revision surgery Yesterday I went to a different doc for a second opinion. He noticed that the knee is quite a bit looser than it should be and suggested maybe replacing the spacer with a thicker spacer. Has anyone had this done? If so, how does it compare to a full TKR in terms of recovery? He also noticed that my patella is floating around and that there is a lot of fluid on the knee. He is going to drain the fluid and take an MRI of the patella .
TY,

"hi, this is my first time posting, I've had knee issues since a skiing accident in March 2019.
I had ACL surgery, Miniscus repair as well as micro fractures to help the cartlidge inside the knee.
All was going well with the rehab until I slipped on the decking at home in late 2020. Mri Scan showed that I'd torn the Miniscus again, there was more damage to the cartlidge and there was a lot of bruising on the bone from the last operation, so needed more surgery to repair both of the miniscus and cartlidge .
I had the surgery yesterday, I was able to walk out of the hospital, Ive taken no pain killers and can walk freely and bend my knee fully already and walk up and downstairs pain free.
Is this normal and am I setting myself up for a fall and the pain is yet to come? As it feels like I've not even had an operation and wouldn't know I have if the bandages weren't on the knee.
Has anyone else experienced this?

"Seven times over the last year (Feb 2020) I have had something in my right knee shift that causing sudden excruciating pain to the point I scream and I can't bear any weight on it.
Feb 2020 I was sitting in a chair with my legs tucked under and stood up.
March 2020 I was on a stool and tucked my legs under on the rail or foot rest.
April 2020 I has sitting on another stool and without thinking did the same thing.
July 2020 I was asleep in bed and shift my legs under the covers.
October 2020 I was sitting on a stool with my legs on a foot rest out in front of me. I shift to adjust my legs.
March 2021 I was sitting and shifted my legs and it happened.
May 9th 2020. I was laying on the couch shifted my legs and it happened.
Occasionally I will have my right knee give out as I am walking and I stumble forward until I catch myself.
Treatment
All of the times I was able to have my husband or friend straighten my leg or yank on my foot and something would happen that made the leg shudder and the pain dropped back to almost zero from a 10.
I only suffered at most for half an hour before we could make something realign. I then did anti-inflammatories, alternating ice and heat with rest and elevation.
I have gone to my Ortho doctor. X-rays were done in Feb 2020. An MRI in April 2020. Both showed normal.
I was diagnosed with a subluxation of the patella but I have never seen or felt with my hand the knee cap out of alignment. I have been to PT on and off all these times and I was still going to PT when May 9th happened.
The May 9th incident is still unresolved. I have tried all the motions that send me screaming to try and get whatever it is back into alignment. I can't straighten the leg or bear any weight on it. Any motion at all is so escalates the pain no matter how minute, shifting my weight while sitting, in the car the pull of inertia in a turn, shifting my leg a few inches.
May 9th.
Urgent Care X-rays showed everything in its proper place but still the pain was excruciating. The knee cap was where it was suppose to be.
May 10th
ER because I couldn't get an Ortho visit and my right foot had darkened in color and felt different. My foot did not have tingles but it felt tight and swollen even though it visually looked the same compared to its partner.
-They gave me a Lidocaine patch (my first), Ibuprofen and Tylenol
Finally got an Ortho visit, he kindly fit me in at t
-MRI is ordered and pending.
-Meds remain the same as the ER.
May 11th
-I shifted my leg on the couch and something on the inner left top side of my right knee moved and the pain dropped by a lot. I can find a position where there is no pain and leave my leg there. I still feel a tightness and some pain in the knee but I have normal feeling and range of motion in my right foot now.
Has anyone had this happen to them? I just want a diagnosis that results in a treatment with a reliable knee. So I can move.
Normal Activity for me.
I am an active person. I bike ride 5 miles daily with 20+ mile rides on the weekend. I have been an amateur ballroom dancer for 20 years that social dances, performs and competes. I dance daily if possible after work. I had worked my way back up to almost my normal activity level when the March 2020 happened. Then I did the rest thing and under the guidance of PT worked my way back up to being more active.
I like to be on the move. I went for a short hike (5 miles) to see wild flowers last weekend, danced (2 hours), and did a 21 mile bike ride. I felt fine and I did dance team Monday and Thursday nights. I teach science and I move about the room and do not sit while teaching. I am a 42 year old female and 30 lbs overweight. I put on 20lbs since Feb 2020 and I was unable to be as active as I wanted to be.

"Hey guys,
Pete here from Ireland, hope you're all well. I'm having fierce trouble with my PCL. I landed down on my left knee playing football January last year. Got the MRI and scan revealed the tear. I rehabbed it. Built up my quads ( previously tore my left PCL so knew what I had to go through ) and went back playing. After about 5 months I started playing matches... although the pain was still there I assumed it be fine. After about two months of games I landed down on my knee ( pretty run of the mill fall ) and the PCL symptoms appeared again ( moving right heel towards right glute causing lots of pain ) When it happened I just assumed I came back too early.
Fast forward to February this year. I'm sprinting with the ball and I hear a slight pop and sure enough same symptoms appear. Running in a straight line apparently not usually assosicated with PCL injuries but it had all hallmarks of one or at least felt like it. I went a head got another MRI scan. The physio and doctor were little stumbled as they didn't think the action matched injury plus they performed PCL test. Anyways test came back and showed chronic PCL tear... not tear tear but showed last tear ( back January previous year ) 
I rested it a little though in fairness I still trained hard as soon as the pain left. I also have very physical job so resting maybe not entirely accurate. I love fitness and as soon as I thought was right I got back to large volume of training ( rowing, running, weight training etc ) 
I thought all was good until 2 weeks ago I was playing an important football game... Landed simply on my knee ( not a big fall ) and thought ouch! I played on... about 20 minute later I jumped and heard a little noise and again felt knee become sore. I finished the game with decreased range of motion and pain. That night swelled out and usual range of motion issues ( pain as right heel goes towards right glute ) 
Last night tried to play our football semi final, knee majority strapped but completely gutted had to come off after 5 minutes due to pain. 
Anybod here with any suggestions. Is it a matter of just totally resting it. I'm at my wits end as I absolutely love football. It's a big part of me but this long term injury has hit me for six. I love to get back to previous ways where a soft landing on my knee wouldn't sett me back months at a time. 
Thanks very much much for your time and sorry for the long post.
Best,
Pete

"I would be interested to know how people are longer term,e.g after 6 months. Most of the accounts are for shorter term recovery issues - so how did it turn out?
For my part it is generally a success  story. I am 66 and had OA for at least 20 years prior to th op following cartilage and other sporting issues. In the end legs were bowed and could only bend to 90 and not fully straighten. Increasing weakness and pain especially standing or walking but could sometimes be pain free when just sitting around.
So after 6 months my leg is both straighter and less bowed. Almost pain free, especially improved standing and walking. So big improvements to lifestyle. The main disappointment is still only able to bend to 90, when it just stops, although not painful unless pushed beyond that. This means that descending stairs properly is not on, can't ride a bike, getting out of chairs still need to push up with hands and difficult to move leg out of the way on trains. My surgeon says that nothing can be done about this downside. Lately it sometimes feels a bit heavy and stiff but nothing that bothering. I should add that I still am hindered by the left knee which I will  have done in the near future and as this is now worse than the operated knee there should be further overall benefits. (This was formerly the better of the two)
In your account can you please say your age (unless you don't want to of course!) and how it was before because we all have different starting points hence expectations.
I look forward to hearing how you are.

"I saw the surgeon a few days ago. What a colossal waste of time. First 2 residents came in Neither one had a laptop, tablet or even a file with them. I always bring a med list and surgery list with me. They made no notes on the computer in the room about my pain, or questions I asked. They never touched my incision or even got close to it. Only thing they did was have me lift my leg up, I was sitting in a straight chair. Then try to pull it back under the chair. I told them my pain is between a 6-8 every day, even tho I go to PT 3 times a week and do my at home exercise. It is numb on the sides of my incision on one side and painful on the other. Back of my knee hurts and where my knee bends in the back. I can do stretching exercises and it feels pretty good, walk around the room and the whole leg tightens up so bad I can't bend my knee without it feeling like the skin is ripping. I ice it, wall, stretch it, get on the NuSTEP and it just goes back to swelling. I was given 5 325 of Norco right after surgery . . . A major surgery and thats what I get. and upped to 10 325 when I ended up in his office 2 weeks later in excruciating pain . The interns leave , the surgeon comes in and says ""Lets see what you can do"". I lift my leg again. He says it looks like 100. That's good for 4 weeks. I tell him about my pain and pain on my leg. He REDUCES my Norco to 5. I asked him how my surgery went, I wanted to know what exactly he did. He says, I fixed it. Does anyone else have all the pain in the leg BESIDES the knee?? I live for the ice. Pt says I am doing great but it sure does not seem like it. Not sleeping from pain. Any ideas or advice? Thanks!!!

"Hello, I am writing for my wife who for a year has had a disorder that only occurs at night time in the early mornings. Every early morning she has a numbness of the muscles of the legs and arms (external part of the mussels) that if she don't get up will loss the sensation. I state she already done all the neurological checks, TAC scans, x-rays ect. ect ....and in the blood tests we found only the low vitamin ""D"" (value = 28), now she is taking vitamin ""D3"" value 5000iu and ""Magnesium"" supplements and lately the value raised up to ""38"" again low so we are thinking of increasing the dose to 10000iu. In this period we have also changed the mattress from a hard material to a soft one and the pillows in design to correct the cervical corrections but not much improvement.
Despite these efforts we cannot understand (included all the specialist doctors that e visited) what is the cause of this problem, the various specialistic doctors continue to say that there is nothing wrong in the checks result but unfortunately the problem is real and still there... do you had similar experience or know someone that had same issue that can suggest what else checks we can perform or supplement vitamin we can use? any info is well appreciate and I thanks in advance... .

"I had total knee replacement in my right knee almost 10 weeks ago. It's been a roller coaster ride and I had to have knee manipulation done last week to that knee because it wasn't bending enough. Now I am experiencing a new pain that is making me very nervous and is making my pt difficult to do. I am getting a sharp pain behind my knee on the inner part of the knee. Its so bad that I can't straighten my leg fully because it feels like something is going to snap. My physical therapist said I pulled something in the back of the knee because I'm not walking properly which is putting strain on the back of the knee. After pt it felt a bit better because they worked on the muscle behind the knee but it prevented me from having a good pt session as far as bending my knee. I woke up this morning and the knee felt fine until I went on my indoor bike and hurt the back of the knee again. I couldn't do anything for the rest of the day because it was so painful. It hurt to walk, to sit, to straighten my leg, and to bend it, Has anyone experienced this and if so, how did you get through it?

"hello all, I probably should be on the Health Anxiety forum as this is not an eminent issue but of course ventured over here because I have fears around knee replacement surgery. I currently have arthritis in my knee and I have had it since I was 27. I will likely need knee replacement in the next 10 to 15 years and I am terrified of getting a blood clot during surgery and it’s traveling to my heart and I die. I have read that is one of the symptoms or risk and have known a person this happened to so now I am terrified. I know I will have to have the surgery or else suffer but I am scared. No this this is not an eminent issue but being the anxious person I am I immediately feel the fear of it. I wonder how you guys overcame this fear. Also do any of you have experience with stem cells and are they effective in helping with arthritis?

"I'm in need of some advice to improve stability in my knee so I can function normally and hopefully play sports casually. I'm in very good physical shape and in my early 30s. I've had a lot of personal experience with ACL tears. I've had 3 ACL surgeries on one knee. First surgery after an initial tear (cadaver), second surgery after a re-tear (patellar), and then a 3rd (patellar) after the prior surgery was unsuccessful - which took me 2 years to figure out. My meniscus is pretty well gone. I've also had a separate surgery before my 3rd (most recent) one to essentially build back the bone that had been drilled through during my first surgery, as it was too wide. I've never torn the other ligaments, though.
I'm 3.5 years out now from my last surgery. I haven't played sports since, just a lot of lifting, biking, running, classes. I still have issues with the stability in my knee. 2 years ago, I went back to a surgeon who said my knee is a little loose (but not that bad), and an MRI came back showing my ACL was intact. I recently had a little discomfort in my leg and realized my hamstring wasn't strong enough, and since focusing on that it has gone away. Over the past year or so, I've gotten the diameter of my quad muscles to be equal (in fact, the quad on my bad knee is now slightly bigger than my perfectly good knee).
However, I still have instability in my bad knee. When I skip a step walking up stairs, my bad knee feels unstable and has difficulty carrying my body when I shift my weight on it (I think I end up compensating by turning my knee inward or pushing off more forcefully with my good knee from the lower step). If I do a one-legged squat on my bad knee, it shakes a little and feels unstable. My good knee is fine. When I do a lateral shuffle, my bad knee again feels unstable when it takes my body weight. When I flex my knee straight and bent, it has a little tweaking sound (not the big popping sound that people often experience initially after surgery - although I had that before).
I've done so much PT in the past that I incorporate some of the exercises in my workout routines. So I'm not sure PT would be the answer (including the fact that my bad knee has more muscle mass than my good knee at this point). Although, I don't do one legged bosu ball type exercises for stability.
**What am I missing? How can I get the stability up in my knee? ** I want to get back to playing soccer and basketball.
Thank you

"Hello, I have Chondromalacia and because I sometimes have discomfort despite having got treatment I thought I'd ask for some advice here.
So I was diagnosed a couple years ago. An orthopedic sent me to a physical therapist and I did regular specific exercises, got hot/cold treatment, and shock treatment. I had a disagreement with the physical therapist and stopped going. The orthopedic hinted that the PT just wanted money and said I should just do a lot of swimming with flippers, on my back. An olympic gold medalist's PT also said the other one just wanted money and played down the whole condition, saying three months of PT was more than enough.
So I stopped altogether, but I went to a gym and continued doing extensive focalized exercises. During quarantine I reverted to the bed exercises again. In the gym I started jogging very lightly. I got discouraged after a few days of mild knee pain when I attempted my first outdoor jog. It had been a year though. The pain went away though, and I've been going every few days, lightly.
The problem is, I feel mild discomfort on a daily basis. Is it normal? I never felt certain about abandoning the first PT because only she examined me extensively, and despite our disagreement she seemed very dedicated. I figured because it wasn't conclusive I'll just try and continue the exercise and be careful the rest of my life. Unless the discomfort is bad.
On a hypochondriac side note, I also lift weights often and play guitar daily, but for the past 10 days I've stopped cause of pain in both my thumb joints. I feel like I must have sensitive joints or sparse cartilage. Can you get the Chondromalacia equivalent in your thumbs?

"I have had a TKR on both knees, one three years ago and the other eight weeks ago. As I work on the recovery of the recent knee the other knee has developed a clicking sound and feel when it bends eg when climbing stairs. It feels as if the joint has loosened a little and I was wondering whether anyone else has experienced a similar problem. I would welcome any comments. Thank you

"I just had my meniscus repaired and a cyst removed from my left inside knee. 
two small holes were made just under my knee cap, and on the inner part of my knee an incision was made to remove the cyst (4 stitches).
I spent 2 days in the hospital recovery.  I was feeling really good and getting around on my crutches well with minimal swelling and pain to the area.
ive now been home 3 days being a couch potato and doing my best to recover.  I notice when I lift my leg under my own power it feels like the inner ligament is under stress and I feel shooting pain in my knee, so I try not to move my knee unless assisted by my own hands.  I can bend the knee just fine, no pain, with my hand assistance.
last night with my knee resting straight on the couch I noticed discomfort.  I stood up with my crutches and noticed my knee was swelling up and became very painful in the area the cyst was removed.  It became very painful to keep straight after.  After 5 days now of recovery feeling better each day, it now feels like I just got out of the OP and I'm back to day one.  It pretty swollen now on the inner part, inside, cyst removal area of my knee.
can someone tell me what might be happening and is causing the slight swelling and pain now?

"Hope my ordeal does not scare or think this will happen to them, not everyone has a great outcome there is a small percentage of those where things did not go as planned. As the title says my latest surgery was Dec31st one month ago. This was a total knee revision due to increasing instability and pain from previous revision 2 years prior. One year ago had a partial my knee dislocated twice in a 3-4 month time frame ( trust me does not feel great when it happens )at the time first thought the whole knee had to be redone but it turned out the plastic on the tibia section needed to be replaced not a big deal. This did fine for a period of time but the knee started to give out on occasion maybe once a month and even then I was still walking 3-4 miles daily. As time wore on what started as once a month became more frequent until it started happening several times a day every day. My surgeon said the next replacement needs to be a hinged but he warned me it does not last as long as a typical replacement my reply if I can get 2-3 years with less pain and swelling then to me its worth it since dealing with how it currently felt was not good. He agreed surgery was New Years Eve, there was a few complications mostly involving femoral component he had to use cement to install the new implant due to not enough bone left to drill to get a secure fit?? So a brief history all of this started in 2003 to date this was 20th surgery 7th TKR fingers crossed will be the last?? Considering my history time in OR going into second month I should be more mobile but not there yet walking is a joke 10-15minutes is it anything longer pain is thru the roof, almost the same with driving short trips drug store maybe a quick in and out small grocery store but the longer on my feet the worse it gets. Yes I ice and elevate during the day wish I did not need pain meds but without them it would be worse. Currently taking celebrix 2x a day 600mg of Gabapentin 3x aday and 10mg Oxycodone 1-2 as needed every 4 hours slowly doing better with taking this yes when I have over done it I will take 2 of the Oxy but mostly just one and instead of every 4 hours try to space it out longer. While yesterday was not exactly pain free I managed to only take 3 of the Oxy cheap thrill. So yes recovery is no fun pretty much stinks nothing about it is easy.

"Hi everyone. I needed a forum tonight. I am 5 weeks postoperative, with a double knee replacement. Man, this something. I have a three-part recovery, it seems. 1. Pain and stiffness. 2. Fatigue. 3. Emotions. I stopped the narcotic pain meds two weeks ago because they truly scared me. Helpful, but don't want a drug recovery to follow this recovery. So, there's pain, mostly high up in the back of my calves. Fatigue is why I checked out this forum. Gawd!!! Washed out at the most simple task, such as cooking, and just don't feel well. Emotions, well, I have had my moments but know what do do with that. Has anyone done both knees?

I have severe arthritis in both of my knees. My surgeon recommended doing the first knee now and the other 3 months later. What do you guys think from your experience?
My first operation is this week. I read somewhere on here that it's good to invest in something that produces ice or something you wrap around your knee which keeps it cool to reduce swelling.
Does anyone know the name of this?
Also, any post op tips?

"Hi there,
I am wondering if you can help - I've been suffering from chronic knee issues for a year and a half now.
I'm male, 32 and in good physical shape.
I'm a fanatic runner who was previously running up to 3 times a week - 10K, 15K / Half marathon distances - with no issues at all. In fact, I have never had any injuries at all up until this point despite playing a range of sports.
However, I started to have pain towards the back of my knee when I was training for my first marathon and increasing my millage to the 30k mark. I also played badminton after a long training session when I first noticed the pain but figured it would just go away.
Since first having the pain - i've rested my knee for months, used ice etc. The pain subsided - however, every time I start running again, the pain comes back after about 3.5k. It's been like this over the last year,.
I've been doing physio rehab for 6 months - to the letter - as well as pacing myself with small 2k runs as per my physios advice - however, this pain is still coming back at 3.5k in to my runs.
I had an MRI scan done a year ago that informed me I had a semimembranosus tendinopathy
However, I have just had another MRI scan done last week (images attached) where the radiology report has diagnosed bone marrow edema on the lateral tibial plateau. He suggest's this is due to prior trauma. There was no mention of a tendinopathy.
I was hoping that someone can review these images and let me know their thoughts?
Why is this bone marrow edema still showing after a year and a half?
What can I do to treat this if first line treatments dont seem to be working - e.g. I've tried so far: rest, NSAIDS, hot/cold, physiotherapy, massage, shockwave therapy, pacing, isometric exercises etc.!
If relevant - I also have Osgood-schlatter (completely unsymptomatic) and am hyper-mobile in most joints in my body (again unsymtomatic)

"I used to run everyday. I started lifting weights instead but randomly ran 2 days in a row in mid December. It was cold outside and I didn't stretch before/after either day. The day after my 2nd run, my knee was very swollen. It was hard to extend or bend my leg. Since then, I've been using Voltaren to lower the swelling and it's helped alot. It's been about 2 months and the swelling has went down alot, but I think there's still a little swelling. There's not much pain. There's slight discomfort if I bounce around and squat my butt to the ground, but it's tolerable. I'm able to to workout my legs with weights and there's not any discomfort.
I'm hearing/feeling a pop in my knee and that's my biggest concern right now. I notice it when I walk and can feel the bones/ligaments on the inner side of my knee moving around when I do full squats, like butt to the ground. It feels like its getting better, but am not sure because of the popping thats happening. If I jump in my bed, I am careful to not torque my leg too much because that's when I feel the most discomfort.
I look online to see if my symptoms match up with anything, but am not finding much. I think if it was a serious injury, I wouldn't be able to bend/extend my leg or lift weights with my legs. I think I could run on it if I wanted, but don't want to reinjure it.
The popping is my primary concern. I think there's still a little swelling. My knees look the same in the mirror. What do you think?

Went to a physiotherapy gym session a couple of days ago and the treadmill and other appartus were fine. However, I cannot turn a full cycle on the exercise bike. My knee is at 70% and should ideally be 90% but this was the first physio session I've had since the operation. Knee is still stiff and quite hard. Anyone else having or had this experience with bending the knee. Others at the gym session could bend their knee better but had difficulty using the treadmill! A bit disappointed about this.

Lots of things have improved but the numbers seem to b the defining variable regarding progress. My PT can get me to 120 on flexion (ouch) and 12 on extension. In a month flexion gains were 5 degrees and extension are 3 degrees. I am used to making alot of gains in just about anything I do......but this TKR has been humbling. My PT said we r now moving into a more aggressive phase of treatment.....which suggests to me he wants to get more progress b/4 the window of opportunity closes.

"Beginning to feel miserable! I have a pretty good range of movement in my knee - but the moment I sit for even a short period it gets stiff. If I stand for a while cooking or cleaning - that also causes pain. I can walk around the house fine, but outside it becomes painful very quickly and I have taken to using a stick and really can't walk far. It's still swollen up on the inside of my leg and shin just below my knee. I'm 51/2 months post op. When I am at rest there is little pain and it doesn't keep me awake at night - but other people I know have recovered much quicker. I do have to say that I was due to have the other knee replaced yesterday (4 May) obviously cancelled for now, and that might well be affecting the operated knee. Please can someone reassure me that still having more than what I would consider a reasonable amount of pain at this stage is normal?

"Hi, just wondering if anyone has any ideas. I've suffered from anterior knee pain for the past 6 years. It came on slowly after moving house and at first I noticed it only the odd time as I was climbing stairs. It has now progressed to the point where I suffer from it constantly and dread climbing the stairs in my house, or crouching down to get something out of a kitchen cupboard. Kneeling down is painful and my knees click and hurt even when doing the simplest exercises. I went to my GP about it years ago who told me to take painkillers, when that didn't work I was sent to a specialist where I had an MRI scan. They diagnosed I had knee pain, which, like, I could've told them before! I went to a private physio who gave me exercises to strengthen certain muscles, did infrared treatment and even a bit of acupuncture, none of which made much difference, but I eventually stopped going back to her as it was costing me a fortune. I tried to ignore the pain and put it to the back of my mind, but it has got progressively worse since then. My MIL told me it was probably because I was too fat (Lovely of her, I wasn't even overweight!) Weirdly though, when I was pregnant a year ago the pain totally disappeared, and I mean totally! I couldn't even make it come by walking at funny angles and using my knees badly. I just wasn't in pain any more. And I put on lots of weight when I was pregnant, obviously, maybe 15kg. No knee pain even when I was 9 months pregnant and could hardly lift myself out of a chair! Then I had the baby and within a month the knee pain was back. Since then I have lost more than 20kg and the knee pain is as bad as ever. It doesn't get better as I lose weight. I can't believe it's just because I'm getting old, as the temporary relief during pregnancy makes me think it's caused by something that can be reversed. I feel unwilling to go back to my GP again and go through the whole specialist/MRI thing again if I'm going to be told again at the end that I have knee pain! Does anyone ave any ideas how I could approach this? Thanks!

"**I dont know if anyone will see this at this point, but I am having similar pain to others that posted long ago. I had total knee replacement 10/2019, and now that side is stiff as a board, have pain in butt (literally), pain down side and back of leg. Had partial hip replacement in 2016 due to fall and also have scoliosis (am a mess; an osteo doctor's nightmare). Have been told to have the hip redone into a total hip replacement, but I am not convinced that that will solve all the problems. Am unbalanced when I walk and have come close to falling several times. Am about to try a spine doctor, as I do not wish to go through any unnecessary surgery; have already been through enough. Seems like any surgery I get, things only get worse. Also, to mention, on the side with the ""replacement parts"" -that leg is .8 cm longer than the other. I think that, combined with the scoliosis and arthritis, perhaps evening the legs may be in order (if it can even be done (am in 60's). One thing I also noticed is that the ""new"" knee is higher than the other knee. Strange-have never seen that on anyone, not even in pictures I see of other people with knee replacements. Would appreciate any input anyone has...!

I can lie on bed with foot on ball and have a straight knee, I can bend the knee fairly easily to beyond 90 degrees, however the 2 exercises I really struggle with are the leg lift exercises The first is sit with ball between knees and lift both feet by straightening the legs and hold 5 seconds. The second is similar but lift just the operated leg in the same way. This causes me extreme pain in muscles of the thigh and buttock. Any ideas anyone. I am using ice as recommended.

"Approximately 16 months ago I had a left total knee replacement(TKA). I was a very motivated rehab patient (80 visits to PT and hours on many types of machines). Today I still limp (5 degrees extension and 105 degrees flexion). I can probably live with this, but I'm not particularly happy. My ROM should be better (no limp). My knee joint is without infection and well aligned and very stable. My surgeon confirms this and states that my joint is ""tight"" with no instability. He recommends a single component open surgery polyethylene liner exchange. He believes my implanted liner component is 2-3 mm too thick and has reduced my ROM arc. He believes a thinner liner will enable me to improve my ROM. Does anyone have any experience with this type problem and a recommendation or solution. My research has been unsuccessful in finding much information for my issue. Thank you very much!

"For the past 3 weeks following a partial knee replacement, I have been trying to sleep on my back with my operated leg straight. The rationale from the physioptherapist is that it will help get the 15 degrees of bend out of it (which is hard to do anyway). I went into surgery with 17 degrees of bend and limited flexion (less than 90 degrees). However, after a few minutes, it becomes very painful under the knee and I have to move the leg. This is despite taking 100 mg Tramadol, 1000 mg of paracetamol and 400 my iboprufen and hour before going to bed. Is this a sensible strategy and has anyone on the group persevered with it?

"I recently got diagnosed with the fairly rare condition called Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) a disorder which affects joints. In my case, it was my knee joint, as is often the case.
I'm posting this to help others better identify and understand this condition, and also to explore any possible causes.
PVNS is very easily misdiagnosed by GP's. It was misdiagnosed twice in my case, by two different doctors.
Because it's more common in the 30's and 40's age group, and the symptoms are similar to arthritis, it can be misdiagnosed as the early onset of arthritis of the knee/joint in people who are in the upper end of this age bracket.
In the case of the PVNS affecting the knee joint which results in a tumour growth at the back of the knee (as in my own situation), because the condition often arises after a trauma to the knee joint, the condition can be misdiagnosed as a simple lingering knee injury, leaking joint fluid, giving rise to a Bakers Cyst.
The symptoms of PVNS are both sporadic and very similar to both an ordinary knee injury and arthritis as the condition progresses. The joint becomes stiff and movement restricted. It's usually painless in the early stages but as it progresses it causes mild to moderate discomfort with a persistent burning pain around the joint area.
If left untreated, PVNS in its advanced stages, can render the joint completely unusable, requiring a complete joint replacement.
Here's my own experience of PVNS:
I was taking Tramadol (a painkiller) for back pain and was heavily into exercise and was also carrying a heavy bicycle every day up and down stairs. I injured my knee. This was due to the Tramadol I believe. My pain tolerance threshold was at a much higher level, so the injury didn't fully register and I continued exercising and carrying the bicycle, further straining the already injured knee.
Two years later, the knee joint gradually became stiffer and a lump appeared at the back of the knee. It became so stiff I could no longer crouch or bend down to tie my shoe laces. I went to the doctor and was misdiagnosed as mentioned. The second GP ruled out arthritis from an x-ray and to confirm his diagnosis of a leaking joint and Bakers Cyst, he requested an ultrasound scan of the joint. The scan showed an overgrowth on the lining of the knee joint and a tumour growth, resulting in a PVNS diagnosis by an orthopedic consultant.
A proof-positive diagnosis is carried out from sample by examining cells under the microscope from the joint which have the typical PVNS-like abnormal characteristic.
There's two forms of PVNS, localised and diffused. The localised version is what I have. It is a lot easier to treat using key-hole surgery with a better prognosis for recovery. Diffused PVNS affects the entire joint lining, requiring open surgery to remove all of the knee lining and it has a much higher risk (almost 50%) of returning, and requiring extensive physiotherapy.
PVNS is quite a rare condition as I mentioned. Therefore it's not encountered very much by GP's and there hasn't been much research done into the causes of the condition or why it returns in many sufferers. It's not thought to be hereditary, and as I mentioned, trauma to the affected joint is a common feature.
This leads me to wonder if certain medicines, or activities, may cause the condition. As I mentioned, in my own case I was taking Tramadol (at a normal dose of 50mg once daily) for several years, both prior to, and after my knee injury.
I'd be interested to hear from anyone else out there who suffers with PVNS and their backgrounds, in particular:
Anyone who has developed PVNS while being on Tramadol or similar drugs?
Anyone who has developed PVNS after a sports or work related injury, which they ignored?
How much time elapsed from any initial injury to PVNS symptoms and diagnosis?

"hello I had knee replacement Nov 2,2020 I was in the hospital 3 days longer then expected because blood pressure was up and I wasn't able to lift my leg I had an

"So I'm currently a few months out since my injury and I'm able to walk around slowly without crutches. Still working on trying to get full flexibility in my knee. I can only bend it around 90 degrees with discomfort and pressure on it. The other day I was standing up from my chair, which I can now do by pushing up on both knees almost 50-50 and I felt something like a tendon(?) or something move in my knee. After making sure my knee wasn't going to give out, I'm able to walk around and sit like how I've been. Does anyone know what this could've been? I had been feeling a ""peeling"" sensation before this happened, and now my knee constantly feels sore or under pressure if I'm not laying down. Exercising and putting weight on it when bending the knee feels a little worse than before.

"Related to another post I just put up, I dislocated my knee and had to use crutches for awhile. I've never used them and was almost jumping around on my good knee and it would begin to hurt. Months later and months after stopping the use of crutches, my good knee has had a persistent weakness when I walk, with a clicking sensation when taking a step. My good knee is also painful to bend all the way back and more importantly, the muscle and tendons under my knee ache SO uncomfortably when I lay down on my back to sleep. It hurts the direct back of my knee, a bit above it and a part of the back of my calf. I rotate my leg to the sides to try to get comfortable but it still hurts. Theres also pain on what I believe is a bone spur below the front of my knee. It never felt like its eased in the months I've felt it, and sometimes it feels like it goes up to the back of my thigh when sitting. Does anyone have any idea what this could be?

I am a fit 73 year old, slim build, definitely not overweight and am doing all the exercises which were given me in the hospital. Physio has been poor (no real help given other than 'just do the exercises'.

"I had revisions on both knees within 2 years of the original replacements. Now I am experiencing horrible pain in the left knee. Went to the ortho who x-rayed it and said he thinks it's loose again!! He said I'm not a candidate for another replacement. I certainly do not want to think of another knee surgery but the pain is unbearable. He told me to keep riding the exercise bike. I am confused and thoroughly disgusted. After he did the revision on this knee, he told me it would never get loose. I made an appointment with another ortho for a second opinion, but have to wait almost 2 months to see him. I wish I would never have done any replacement at all. It hurts to walk and I am a widow who lives alone. I have to do everything for myself.

"Hi everyone,
I shattered my right patella into 4 pieces around 9 months ago in a car accident (knee hit the dashboard very hard). I did not have surgery because the pieces were only mildly to moderately displaced. Overall, my knee feels a lot better. It typically doesn't hurt at all unless I am standing up after sitting or climbing up or down stairs. I was recently reading about how stairs can put tremendous force on the patella, up to 5 times your weight. I weigh 180 lbs, so 5 times 180 lbs is 900 lbs of force!
I am in the market for a house, and there are both 1 story and 2 story houses available in my area. The idea of putting 900 lbs of force on my patella going up and down stairs numerous times per day does not seem very appealing. The back of my kneecap is definitely not smooth nor in the correct shape due to healing after being displaced. I'm afraid I would potentially speed up the development of arthritis if I move into a 2 story house, so I am inclined to focus on buying a 1 story house. I would be totally happy in a 1 story house, so I really don't mind.
Am I being paranoid? Or do I have a legitimate concern about frequent stair usage over a period of many years speeding up the onset of arthritis?
Thanks!

"OK so it's been 2 years since my right knee TKR, after 2 months i fell down my stairs . got it X-rayed and told that all was OK. moving on to this point. 20 months after my fall, my left knee is fine but my right knee is still not as mobile as i would like. I Am a painter and decorater and back to work, and to be honest really feel that i can't do it. I Am on my knees a lot thru work with really good quality knee pads. I can get onto my left knee easily but when i try and push up with my right knee after a minute or 2 my right knee suffers really sharp pains especially on the outside of of my knee and it takes me a good couple of minutes to get it going. also my balance is totally shot to hell. and i feel that i really am dragging my legs. i have been back to see the physio and she recons that it could be that my hips are very weak and that is causing the problems. but can't see how. any advice would be appreciated

"Hello. I have been having chronic knee pain in both knees for 5 months now. The pain is all around the knee, to include: the kneecap and below, the sides, and back of the leg near the hamstrings.I first noticed soreness in my knee over year ago after running. However, it was only for about a week or so, and did not come back when running. Unfortunately however, since this past April, I have been having a constant ache in both of my knees. I have stopped running and haven't done much of any exercise at all since then, yet I still have it, even at rest. I have tried physical therapy for 14 weeks. I seemed to notice some improvement half way through, but it did not last. I have been going to a new therapist for about 2 weeks now, one that takes a different approach, so I will give that a try for a little bit longer. I have had xrays, MRIs, and EMGs/nerve conduction tests of both knees, and there are no obvious issues. Only thing MRI showed was some slight inflammation. I tried over-the-counter shoe inserts, had no effect. I also received cortisone injections, which did not do a thing. I have been seeing two well regarded sports medicine Doctors, and they are both pretty stumped at this point. The working diagnosis is Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. But unless I have a very severe/stubborn case of it, I'm surprised nothing I have been doing all this time is working.
My question is what else could I have wrong, and how could I fix it? This is beyond frustrating and really bringing me down. Any advice would be appreciated.
Thank You

However, I have been having an issue with it ever since the surgery that makes me worry about it . If I ever decide to sit criss cross for too long of a period, my knee feels strange and when i straighten it out, it feels like the bone on the outer side of my knee joint has dislocated and the straightening puts it back into place.

"I am 13 months post total left knee replacement. I am just curious to know if anyone else is still experiencing stiffness this far in? My stiffness never goes away. Although my ROM varies between 135 and 142, I also still have swelling, and it gets worse if I stand for longish periods, and I also find I don't have full strength back in my knee. My knee is still slightly swollen, and I still have numbness on the outside of the knee. When getting up after sitting for a while, I tend to have to limp for a few steps till my knee feels stable again. Although I can go up and down steps, my operated knee does not feel strong.
I also have another concern, and that is I have developed a terrible ""crunching"" sound in my knee. When going from flexion to extension, it is really loud, and I can actually feel the grinding if I place my hand over my knee. This started about 8 months post op. It is not painful, just noisy. It also happens when going from sitting to standing.
Should I be concerned? Should I be seeing my surgeon , or is this all part of recovery at this stage?

A few weeks ago I did a stair-climb challenge (climb Mount Everest in 7 days) for charity. Obviously, it involved climbing a lot of stairs (over 58,000) but it also meant descending 58,000. I found the descent quite challenging on my knees and by a few days in a had niggles of pain. Nearer the end the outside of both my knees started to get a little swollen. So I finished the stair-climb and gave my self a week off any strenuous activity or exercise so that my knees could recover. However, yesterday I went for a run and the outside of one of my knees swole up. This morning (the day after) it is just as swollen. I also have a little discomfort in it when putting my knee in certain positions. As you can see from the photo the swelling isn't huge but it is there and I can feel it. What could be causing this? And how do I recover from this and stop my knees from swelling?

I am really struggling with the home physio because of a tight, numb feeling from above my knee to just below. I thought it was the feeling of the bandage but that was taken off a week ago. I have the glue adhesive tape and a dressing over the top. I am not sure if the dressing is tight and limiting my movement. I am worried about nerve damage. I am wondering if I will even be walking without crutches in 4 weeks when I am supposed to return to work. There is an improvement in pain since the op but I just can't get around this tight feeling in my knee - it is like my skin is too taut for the leg. Has anyone had this and has it eased?

I will be signed off for 6 weeks and obviously cannot drive. I am also entitled to full pay during the sick leave so I will not lose out in this respect.
I am trying to understand if it is realistic to be expected to sit at a desk for 5-6 hours during those 6 weeks post-op or if they are being unreasonable expecting me to?

"Preface
I'm doing this post because I keep writing the same stuff over and over again on the subject of exercise.  So here it all is in one place.
Why Exercise?
Simply because:
1. Your quads and glutes have atrophied from months of non-use.  Ever see someone's bicep after an 8-week cast is removed for a broken arm?  Budduh...soft as budduh... {as we pronounce it in Brooklyn}  You have to rebuild the strength in your quads, glutes and core...period...no choice...accept it.2. And why exercise?  You do this to take pressure off your knee.  Right now, all the work in your leg is being done by your knee without any supporting musculature.  You must rebuild all that strength to take that pressure off the new joint.
3. And this is not short-term!  You have to stay strong the rest of your life.  Going up and down stairs takes leg strength.  You need to get that back.  And you certainly don't want to walk with a limp or a cane the rest of your life.  You need that leg strength.
4. And, no...you don't get this from PT.  Those sessions are short-term and designed to get your 0 / +120 ROM back.  After that, you're on your own.
5. Finally, this takes work...hard work and a commitment to your overall health and well-being.  It doesn't happen overnight; it will probably take up most of your first year post-TKR.  It usually starts when you finish PT and are recovered enough to start some serious exercise...S  L  O  W  L  Y  !!!
Credentials
I'll be having my 28th operation in 17 years in March 2017...another one on my spine.  Two shoulder rehabs, four knee scopes, artificial hip, back fusion, TKR...I've been through it all.  
But this is not about my veracity in giving advice on post-TKR exercise, it's about FREE recommendations from a true expert personal trainer, my daughter Kate.  Consider:
- Graduate nutritionist from Rutgers University (anatomy, physiology, biology, chemistry)
- Certified by the American College of Sports Medicine (two-year study and examination program, the ""gold standard"" in Trainer certifications)
- Certified by the American Council on Exercise (16 multi-disciplinary credentials such as spinning, kick-boxing, yoga, water aerobics and more)
- Graduate Assistant, Rutgers University, Department of Nutrition, (2000-2001)
- Personal Trainer for the Rutgers University men's NCAA basketball team (2001-2002)
- Corporate Personal Trainer, Medifit, 2003-2010 (Personal Trainer, Site Manager, Program Director)
- Corporate Personal Trainer, PlusOne Fitness, 2010-2013 (Personal Trainer and General Manager/Program Director of five corporate fitness centers for Bank of America, Dallas, TX)
- Mother, Breast Cancer Survivor, 2013-present
By any account, Kate knows this stuff cold...for the past 16+ years.  If you don't believe in what she's advising you, go try and find a more accomplished expert...you won't.  (...and I'm not just saying that because she's my daughter...).  PS: Post-cancer...she's 5'1"" tall, back to a size 1 with 3-4% body fat at 122 pounds (solid muscle) and kicks P90X's butt!!!  And all of this with a compression fracture of L1 and a missing coccyx, removed after she fractured it slipping and falling while squatting 310 pounds years ago.  Did not stop her at all.
Recommendations
- Warm up on a bike for 30-45 minutes (set the seat high enough for full leg extension...hey, you have your ROM back so now use it).  You can do a very slow treadmill but you cannot go fast enough to cause any impact on the knee. The bike or an elliptical is better for the warm-up.  Zero impact.
- Then do your stretches. Before anything else...S  T  R  E  T  C  H  !!!  Get down on the mat.
- Once warmed up and stretched, start your exercises that specifically strengthen the quads (leg presses, curls, squats, abductor and adductor for inner thighs), calves (toe raises, calf press, balance board), hips (hip lift, hip lunge) and glutes (leg pull, kickback, flutter kicks).  Stretch out the hamstrings.  
- For all your exercises, start with NO weight but perform 3-4 sets of 12-15 reps each until you are at ease with every exercise and are not tired out by them.  (NOTE: If you can't do that many to start, do what you can and build up to it.)  More reps, no weight...you must build endurance before strength.
- Use your good leg to stabilize yourself during the exercise...don't use the good one to fake the reps.  The idea is to get the bad leg as strong as the good one before you fully exercise them together again.  You can even isolate the bad leg for the exercise (good one on the floor) but this could be tough at the beginning.  
- Once you can't tell one leg from the other (feeling balanced and not relying on the good one), start adding weight...slowly....like 5 pounds at a time, again using the good leg to stabilize yourself.  
- Alternatively, use exercise bands around your ankle.  Face the bar and pull straight back to work your glutes (unless your gym has a machine for that).  No weight and minimum (10# or 20# band) to start.  A set of bands and elastic ropes with handles at home are great to use too.  There are YouTube videos on leg exercises using the bands.
- Any pain, strain or swelling means you did too much too fast.  Back off...you'll eventually have equal strength in both legs.  
- Finish your workout with more bike or walking...take time to cool down.  
BIG NOTE: You are NOT to do this every day.  You NEVER work the same muscle group two days in a row.  The exercise breaks down muscle; the rest day allows your body to rebuild it stronger.  So, if you don't want to take a day off, use the odd day to work core and upper body.  Total health.  Lose weight, eat healthy, eliminate artificial sweeteners, hydrate, chart your progress, stay focused.
Conclusion
This is your life and your choice.  You can sit back, relax and limp the rest of your life or get a good part of that life back.  No, you will not do any high impact sports or exercises again, but there is always cutthroat shuffleboard.  You will never get your old life back but you can live THIS life to the fullest!

"can anyone tell me what to do about ankle and foot pain after a TKR? this is my 6th surgery in the same knee. In October 2019 they removed my first knee replacement due to infection and out in an antibiotic spacer. I could not put any weight on it at all and had to learn how to get around in one leg while my right leg just hung there. Long story short I had my new knee put in back on May 27, 2020. My leg and ankle still swells and i have pain in my ankle and foot when i walk and it gets worse the more i walk. i am seven weeks post surgery and still only have 94 degrees ROM! I am also experiencing the feeling of a band around my knee. anyine have any suggestions on the ankle and foot pain and the feeling of a band around the knee?

"Febuary of this year I went for a total left knee replacement, maybe the biggest mistake of my life. First thing I noticed was severe tibia pain and was told this could be a nerve. Began PT 2 weeks after surgery and completed 4 weeks later, still had tibia pain even though walking on it, finally after pressing Dr. CAT Scan was preformed and discovered the implant broke my tibia at the end of the rod 7"" into tibia. Began non weight bearing and knee began to swell and infection set in, 8 days in hospital and rounds of antibiotics I was released. A few more weeks and began weight bearing per Dr. orders and 10 days later it broke again. Back on crutches and now my knee is beginning to lock up as if implant is shifted. To get it to become unlocked I have to rub and pull on my knee cap. Any input would greatly be appreciated.

"This will be a long post - my apologies.
So I had a right TKR in March 2019. My recovery was uneventful, I did all the recommended physio and my surgeon cleared me to return to work 12 weeks after the surgery. I was doing well, able to work full time (I'm a nurse), able to ride an exercise bike every day and comfortably walk my dog 4 km every other day. At my one year check up the surgeon was happy with my X-Rays and the 120 degree bend in my knee. I told him I still had some tightness and pain (behind my knee and in my calf) that prevented me from bending it further but this didn't seem to concern him.
About a month after my visit with the surgeon and about 30 minutes into my early morning walk, my calf suddenly become very tight - tight to the point of being very painful. Thinking it might be a cramp I kept walking and by the time I'd hobbled home (another 10 minutes) my calf was swollen and my knee was also painfully tight and throbbing. I was actually reminded of the bone on bone pain I used to get before the surgery.
Anyway, fast forward 2 months and I am no longer able to walk my dog. Every time I try I only get about 15 minutes into it and my calf starts to hurt and then swell, my knee starts to hurt and get tight and I have to limp home yet again. This was also happening if I had a busy night at work and walked more than usual, so I cut back to part time. I saw a Physiotherapist who told me my new knee is strong and my problem is muscular - he gave me some dry needling and more exercises which haven't helped. Thinking it might be my gait causing the problem I saw a Podiatrist. She told me I have loose ligaments in my feet which probably isn't helping - she gave me shoe inserts and more exercises which haven't helped.
My daily exercise is now limited to a very sedate 10 minute walk on a treadmill and 10 minutes on an exercise bike. I have to pay someone to walk my poor dog. I take a combination of Paracetamol and iBuprofen when the pain gets really bad at work, and when I get home I elevate my leg and use an ice-machine. I also try a heat lamp and a hand held massager on it sometimes. Nothing seems to be helping and I have no idea why I suddenly seem to be going backwards...?? Has anyone reading this had a similar experience by any chance? I welcome and would appreciate any help. Thank you.

"I last visited this website during the eight months after my total knee replacement in February of 2019. It was a difficult year of recovery with ups and downs , but with therapy and exercise things did get better. I had my year's checkup and x-rays in February of this year, and the surgeon was pleased with my progress and said all was well. I am presently having renewed tightness and stiffness in the knee - much more so than previously. The doctor told me that it may well take another year for this to improve, but it seems to be getting worse. I walk every day and exercise the knee, but itcontinues to be stiff, tight and sometimes swollen. I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has experienced this problem, and any measures I might need to take to help this condition improve. Thank you! I hope you are still on board, Chico!!

"I had a revision of a Partial knee replacement done 1 week ago which resulted in my having a TKR done instead as the Partial was subsiding. The surgery went well but I have numbness in my heel and foot. I can move my toes and feel them to an extent but am left with a dead leg feeling. I was told it should be fine in time but it has obviously left me feeling disappointed and worried that I will be left this way indefinitely. It is very early days and I will have my 6 week check up to go to when hopefully I will feel better but I wanted to know if anyone else had this happen. I had a spinal anesthetic procedure and knew the possibility of nerve damage.

"Hi Forum,
I am a 32 year old that has been suffering from chronic knee pain for 2.5 years following a sports injury. I have had an operation, seen countless doctors and physios and don’t know what to do next. Below is a summary of my issues (a short, and longer version is attached as a PDF). If anyone has any ideas at all, I would be eternally grateful.
Thank you very much.
Executive Summary:
Following a sports injury 2.5 years ago, I developed persistent swelling and pain behind my left knee. Symptoms included tightness, muscle pain, and swelling, all located typically behind the knee. Generally, no pain was felt within the knee itself. An MRI indicated a loose body in the knee, and arthroscopy surgery removed it. Pain persisted, characterized by bouts of behind the knee swelling and pain following moderate sports. Pain associated with each flair up would typically last 1-3 months, during which time I was able to walk, and occasionally ice skate, but essentially no other physical activities. Twice during this time, fluid was drained from my knee and provided considerable relief. New MRIs indicate an atypical ganglion cyst in my knee. Uncertain if this is causing the behind the knee pain. Other thoughts have included L5 nerve issues, rheumatoid arthritis (discounted from blood work), tendinitis (popliteus or other), knee pain resulting from an earlier ankle injury that causes my ankle to roll inwards. Prior to the injury 2.5 years ago I was very healthy. I did have a successful arthroscopic surgery on the same knee approximately 15 years prior, when a loose body was also extracted.
I am currently seeing a physiotherapist and working on the ankle injury in hope it may provide some relief. I am also scheduled to see a knee specialist this month. If anyone is interested, I also have a longer detailed document of my injury I could share.
Many thanks for any help at all.

"I saw my surgeon yesterday for my almost one year check up. He says my kneecap is not sitting correctly and causing rubbing and pain in my knee. He wants to see me again in 6 months and if it's still not right or is any worse, wants to put a ""plastic button-like device"" under my kneecap to prevent it rubbing and causing pain. Has anyone else had this done? I'm in Australia...he says they often do this in U.S.A. as part of the original surgery. He also told me that this added surgery can not be guaranteed to correct the problem or stop the pain!! Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

"Hello, 

As said in the title, I have a question about an artificial meniscus implant. Due to constant troubles with my left knee, and subsequental removal of my lateral meniscus in my left knee, I am considering getting an artificial implant. I would like to know how do they attach the meniscus inside? I am reading on a few articles, which say no attachement is necessary but it unclear to me whether this is the same in lateral and in medial meniscus.  Is it all the same in both? Does wary on the material used to make the implant? 

To my understanding, this is quiet a new treatment, but in any case any information would be welcomed.

"First noticed when I brushed my hair a few days after getting home from knee replacement. I'm 71 and have fine but fairly thick hair which I don't dye. I have asked the ortho who did the surgery, my pain management doctor who is an anesthesiologist and my dermatologist and they all dismissed it without saying might be from stress of surgery or anesthesia - pain dr. even saying he never heard of that. I googled about 6 weeks out when I was feeling better and found it can happen but usually stops after a few weeks. I am nearly at 5 months and it's still happening. I take biotin, use hair products without chemicals and although my hair isn't terribly thin, it still comes out on my brush every time I brush my hair. Anyone else have this going on........?

"So i have had this rash for around 3/4 months. Started small, progressively got drier and redder. I used to have eczema as a child & it runs in the family so my first solution was cetraben / hydrocortisone if i needed a stronger emollient. Used both and they helped with the dryness but never with the rash itself. I then eventually rung the GP and she prescribed me Daktort as she thought it was a fungal infection. Used this for 14 nights 2 times a day & this also offered no resolution. Doctor has advised me to visit when restrictions have eased but im on here wondering if anyone knows what this could be.

"Hi all, forgive me if this is posted in the wrong forum, I've never posted here before so hopefully, these type of questions are permitted.
I usually don't ask people online for medical advice, but seeing how my PT will be unavailable until July, I have to make an exception.
So as the title says, I'm facing a persistent but mild pain at the back of my knee that started a few months ago in February after I decided to go on a 10km walk each day.
Seeing as how I was not physically active as I used to be, I wanted to at least do something until I could afford to go back to the gym, and to go back to doing cardio like jogging or cycling. That is why I decided to take on a 10k walk each day to at least do something instead of sitting in front of my PC all day long.
Shortly after a few weeks of me doing that, each time I was out on a walk, I began to feel a slight pain at the back of my knee in my right leg which only worsened the more I pushed through it.
After noticing that, I decided to rest and let it pass using the RICE method. At this time the COVID quarantine started, so I wasn't able to go on walks as I used to and decided to use that time to rest my knee even more.
Fast forward to May and the end of quarantine, I started to go on my 10k walk routine again, only this time the pain came back quickly on the first day, starting again from mild to strong the more I go.
I knew there was something wrong when nothing changed over these 2 months, so I decided to google the problem to see if it was anything serious, and I couldn't find anything. The only thing that I did find is that it could be hamstring tendonitis, which seems to fit the description of my problem well. I have tight hamstrings, and overuse of them could have been the result of this, the only thing that I do not understand is, why did it only appear on one of my legs and not the other?
And that's why I'm here asking you guys, if you could give me any advice on what this problem might be and if there is any way to fix it.
Thanks in forward, and apologies for the long post.

I tried to explain at my last appointment the tightness in my knee and calf and the clicking noise when I move my foot forward when walking. I was told it would take time. I'm finding after getting out of bed my knee feels comfortable. Unfortunately as soon as I have walked a few steps the tightness in my calf and knee comes back, clicking never goes away. I've tried carrying on with walking to try and walk it off and calf stretching exercises, but gets more uncomfortable. Anyone else had these problems?

"About 8 weeks after my second knee replacement (1st was a breeze year before) started have pain in lower back on same side going into buttocks very intense and constant. in rehab they said it happens because of gait change and will probably get better over time after 12 weeks rehabs nothing changed, have continued on with the exercises for my knee and went to further physcio for 8 weeks ending in February 2020 . Pain still there, doctor sent me for MIR in beginning of March it showed no pinched nerve, some inflammation in S1 joint and moderate osteoporosis in this area and hip. Doctor says not far enough along for any surgical intervention, believes cortisone shot will not help advises not to take to many strong medication, but recommends maybe more physcio, chiropractor, but we are now dealing with the coronavirus. Would appreciate any suggestions as the daily pain is hard to deal with and none of above suggestions are open right now.

On some occasions, first one was many months after my initial tear injury, my knee locked into place whilst bent, and i was unable to straighten it as it felt impossible to do so physicall and also along with the pain that came from trying to do that. I am aware that there is likely a piece of cartilage in there loose blocking the knee joint and causing this, but before going ahead with surgery I was wondering if these symptoms would likely worsen or not if i were to not have surgery, and if not doing so would cause me more damage.

I got up and had no pain anywhere so continued my walk...rough ground, about 40 minutes. The next day I had no problems except for the bruising on my good knee so I went for another walk....about 45 minutes. then the weather changed so much shorter walks each day, but a few days later my PKR knee started to ache especially when sitting and it has gradually got a little worse. No swelling, no bruising, but a little more stiffness. No pain on walking, but stairs not so good again.

"Hello, I've had knee pain in both knees for quite sometime that gets worse when standing for a while and if I try to squat down. However, yesterday, while sitting down I noticed a very sharp pain in the outer part of my knee. It is brief but very painful.
This is now happening today when I just bend my knee outward (flexion of the knee) at a certain angle. Also while walking it will just randomly cause pain. I have had random knee pain similar to this but not as often, generally once a month or maybe a week also not while walking usually just sitting.
I workout regularly and generally don't have knee pain while working out, I find that a bit odd too.
Attached is an image of where the knee pain is.

"This is for everyone but especially for those who can't afford PT or are too far away to travel to one.  Remember: The goal is to break up the forming scar tissue.  Screw the pain...do the work!!!  You want to walk with a limp the rest of your life?
#0... Warmup:
Nothing beats a stationary bike to get the blood moving and to warm up the knee.  This is usually a given.  Virtually all PT sessions start out by warming up the knee.  Do this...  No bike?  Take a 10-minute walk...and walk correctly...
https://patient.info/forums/discuss/walking-after-a-tkr-593409?
#1...  Heel Slides:
https://patient.info/forums/discuss/tkr-heel-slide-exercises-526213
When you use a belt to PULL your foot toward your butt, you will be increasing your bend to +120 and beyond.  There is also a medical device to help with this (see picture).
#2... Squats:
Hold onto a chair and do squats.  Deep as you can...hold...stand up...repeat.  Start with three sets of 5 once a day.  Increase to three sets of 10-15 multiple times a day over the course of weeks.  Want more?  Put some weight on your shoulders or hold onto some dumbells to pull you down.
Both the above home exercises will help with your bend.  Do them diligently multiple times a day.  When you see your doc again, he can measure your progress, although when doing the heel slides in the same location all the time, you can have a piece of masking tape on the floor; mark your progress with a pen and date it.
Now for straightening your leg...
#3... Gravity:  
Lie on your bed face down with your knees just on the edge of the bed...NOT OVER IT.  Lower your TKR leg (or both) and just let it hang...gravity will do the rest.  This is one hell of a difficult thing to do.  Count ""x"" seconds...bend the leg back up to vertical...repeat.  You can do as many reps as you can handle for how many seconds you can endure multiple times a day.  As you progress, increase the number of seconds and the number of reps.
The big thing to remember with this is that you CANNOT use your muscles to support the leg.  You have to relax and just let it hang!!!  When you get adventurous, strap on a 2-pound ankle weight.  That will be INTENSE!!!! ...but worth it.
#4... The Gym
Once you get your ROM going pretty well, you'll need to hit the gym anyway to regain all the strength in your atrophied quads, glutes and core.  Doing more leg presses and squats with increasing weight and reps will help finish off your ROM work to 0 / +120...probably beyond.  You can also do this at home with a good set of exercise bands of increasing resistance to do the leg work.
Conclusion:
These are only some of the exercises you can do but, for me, they formed the core of my recovery.  Do some research on the web, especially YouTube, for more ROM exercises.  So, yes, a PT can be of immense help to you but if money or distance are issues, you can do this recovery at home, on your own, if you stay focused and diligent about the ROM work.  You will NOT have a PT pushing down on your knee to break up the scar tissue but you can come close if you do the work!!!
Have fun...

"Newbie to the Forum. Ive had 8 knee surgeries, 5 on right w 2 being ACL Replacements & 3 on left w 1 being ACL Replacement. I'm in my late 40's and can barely walk because i'm in so much pain. Insurance wont approve TKR's & I'm at a loss as to what i can do. I used to be very active & athletic (tore up my knees playing baseball) and it's very depressing to not be able to do normal things like WALK without being in so much pain. Exercising is difficult & no access to a pool. The pain is getting worse & worse and my QOL is going down hill. I've tried both orthovisc & synvisc which minimally help for about a month or 2. Don't think the pain of getting the shots outweigh the benefits of the shot. Looking for any suggestions on other treatments or therapies that may be helpful w the pain. At this point, I'm desperate & willing to try most anything that will help with the pain.

"Haven't been here in awhile. been in PT off and on . Even tried pool therapy. My ROM is 122. I have good movement. The surgeon says you just have to wait, it takes time. Stop exercising.
That's when I saw the 2nd opinion Dr. He just happened to be the Professor of my surgeon. He wanted to do tests. So I let him as my surgeon was doing nothing, Fluid drawn off the knee and sent off. No infection. Blood work. X Rays. Everything is fine, artificial knee in position, no idea why the pain let alone the swelling all down my leg , edema, One morning I had a calf cramp in both legs at once. I leapt out of bed . I had excruciating pain that started at the bottom of my TKR leg and went UP my leg into my KNEE!!! It felt like I was being electrocuted , then it went up my hip, to my butt and into my groin, I thought I was going to die the pain was so bad. I called the 2nd opinion DR. and he suggested an MRI.
I finally had the MRI. I have Spinal Stenosis, Bulging disks, and degenerative scoliosis.Pain Mgt Dr. says he wanted to inject my spine at L3. L4-L5. It could help my knee and side of my leg. He said it could take 4 days to show improvement. I woke up and had NO pain. AT all, not in my knee, leg, groin, hip, etc. It was like miracle. It lasted the rest of the day and almost all of the next. Then it started hurting again on, and off .
I got my 2nd shot 2 weeks later. I hurt so bad I could hardly walk. In fact since the pain in my calf I have been using a cane. I woke up after the injection ready to be painfree again. I was STILL hurting. A lot. I was told maybe the surgeon got too close to something, it takes 4 days. How can a pain medicine take 4 days to start working??? I have also been told these injections cost over $3,000. 15 minute procedure. My insurance approved the procedure but don't know what they will pay. Now the Dr. is talking about a nerve block in my knee. Or a spine stimulater that is implanted with a box in your back, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!Please someone out there tell me they have had the pain this long and there was a solution. can't be the only one with pain this long.
Has anyone else tried pain mgt? or any of these procedures? Please share. I can't imagine having another surgery after what has happened to me after my knee surgery.
I need some hope. Thanks for listening. I hope everyone's pain goes away a lot quicker than mine,

"Hello, I know that there is already a lot of subject concerning this but I want to have an opinion on my case.
I am a 16 year old boy measuring 1.75m (5.74feet), during the last eight months I took 2cm (0.06 feet)
I read that if we had a lot of hair it meant an end of growth ... and that's totally my case !!! I have a beard (a real one) on my chest and more (hair that grows fast and very thick). That said my father is 1m83(6feet) tall and is also very hairy. I was younger very quickly growing up, I was one of the tallest and now almost the smallest. Will I reach 1.80m(5.90 feet)
Thank you in advance and excuse me for the spelling mistakes.

"Hello everyone,
Hope you are all keeping safe and well x
I’m four years post tkr but have recently experienced bouts of excruciating pain that radiates from the outside of my knee, down my leg and into my ankle. It’s got to the point where I can hardly weight bare and nearly collapsed into a pile on to the floor yesterday which was really scary. It seems that each bout of pain is getting progressively worse and today it made me cry. it's slightly swollen so have been icing and taking pain relief to no avail. For obvious reasons I really don’t want to bother my GP with something that’s not life threatening as I think they have enough to deal with at the moment but I’m scared It’ll get to the point where I can’t walk at all. Has anyone else had this happen so long after their tkr? Thank you very much to anyone that replies x

"Hello. Well here goes this.
I have been having some knee clicking issues for the past 4 months. Went to get an MRI and it showed completely healthy knee. Went to the orthopedics 3 times,and the guy doesnt know what to tell me.
The thing is that it shows a bit of inflamed IT section on the lateral area of the knee itself but i dont have any knee pain at all. Its this strange click like the knee adjust itself when i extend the nee and flex it (then comes the pop). I wouldnt mind this damn click if it didnt feel weird and odd.
My muscles do get tense so i do foam roll my muscles.
I dont have any pain or swelling but this click thing is messin with me cause my other knee is messed up from an accident before (acl and patella cartillage). Anyone had a similar problem? I have research this thing to the tee from plica syndore to it band syndrome to patelar tracking.
One physio even told me that seems like my tibia isnt gliding as it should be.

"People with all sorts of injuries very frequently feel ancillary pain somewhere.  Our brains are wired to avoid pain so it automatically tries to protect the painful area and move the ability to perform some action to another muscle group in the body.
For people with knee surgeries, we subconsciously change out gait, shifting the way we walk and therefore putting the pressure on some other muscle group.  Why?  Because the main musculoskeletal structure that enables us to walk properly is centered in the quads, glutes and core.  Unfortunately, after a knee op and weeks upon weeks of disuse, those muscles have all atrophied...dead.  Ever see someone's arm just out of a cast for 8 weeks?  Toothpick.  Same with your muscles.
So we've shifted our gait and the brain has compensated for the knee pain.  The problem is that it has moved the responsibility of those muscles to others...lower back, hip and pelvis...or...groin and inner thigh...or...calf and ankle...or...others plus combinations.  Very typically, our hips, pelvis and SI joints go out of alignment, pinch the sciatic nerve and we have a wonderful case of sciatica.  Simple chiropractor fix in a few weeks of treatment,  Other times, people report extreme calf and ankle pain.  Here, many people get an inexpensive AFO support to help them through the rough period.
Also, some patients report having one leg measured shorter than the other and rush out to spend hundreds on custom shoe orthotics. STOP!!!  When your hips are out of alignment, it causes that length discrepancy.  Always see a chiropractor or your PT before spending the money!!!  It's probably just a hip alignment issue.
ALL OF THIS IS NORMAL...but people get freaked out.  Deep breath...normal...
My approach to any of this is to go the cheapest, non-invasive route...including NO RX DRUGS!!!  Allopathic (western medicine) docs just love to throw pills at problems when there are better, more natural choices.  I always start with a chiropractor for an alignment evaluation.  Treatments help over time.  I have also found acupuncture to really help in some painful circumstances.  If nothing helps, see your ortho for a next step.
Just know that a lot of this pain is typical and normal as our bodies shift position and muscle groups to avoid pain.  Find the root cause and fix it.  To fix the dead muscle problem permanently, here's the plan...
https://patient.info/forums/discuss/post-tkr-exercising-565527
PS: Worst Case Scenario - I did have one situation over 5 years ago where the sciatica was so bad that nothing helped.  Chiro, PT, pain shots...nothing.  Saw my neurosurgeon who found a bone spur at L4 that was literally ""crushing"" (his term) the sciatic nerve root at L4.  Simple spur removal and laminectomy.  Residual pain gone in a few days.  Yeah...sometimes the pain comes from a more serious place...but that's very rare and not as a result of knee surgery.

"Going Up...
- Go to a stair.
- Hold on to the handrail!!
- Put the foot of your BAD leg on the step.
- Pull yourself up to the step.
- Bring up your other foot.
- Put the foot of your bad leg back down on the floor.
- Balance on that leg while you bring your other foot down.
- Repeat...a lot.
A few other thoughts regarding ""up""...
1. You'll probably need to hold on to a handrail at the beginning.  The goal is to do it by yourself without holding on to the rail for balance.
2. You will have a tendency at the beginning to crouch a bit and ""spring off"" with your good leg.  Don't...that's cheating.  The whole point is to build strength in the quadricep of your bad leg.  Success is using the strength of that leg alone to get you to the next step.
3. This is a basic up and down exercise.  As you progress, go to the next step...and then the next...with the bad leg first building your strength.  Finally, go up a flight of stairs normally with alternating legs...and then without holding on to anything.
Going Down...
- Go to a stair.
- Hold on to the handrail.
- Put the foot of your GOOD leg on the lower step.
- Bend your knee and bring the foot of your bad leg down.
- Do the same all the way down.
- Repeat...a lot.
A few other thoughts regarding ""down""...
1. You will have a tendency to not bend the bad leg but to ""swing it around"" to get to the lower step.  Don't do this.  Concentrate on bending your leg, achieving good ROM to get your bad leg down to the next step.  Keep your leg IN LINE and not swinging it out to the side.
2. Once you get stronger, lead with your bad leg and balance on it while bringing your good leg down.  This will rely on your stronger quads.
3. You'd better hold on to a handrail while doing this...probably for a long time.  Don't trust the new knee completely until your quads are really strong and you feel that you have your balance back.
TKR CHALLENGE...
Go up the stairs TWO AT A TIME!!!!!!  Yes, this will take you a year or more to achieve...At nine months p/o and almost 69 years old, I'm not close to doing this on a whole flight of stairs although I can do the first double (but I still cheat by pulling on the handrail a bit...very annoying...gotta try harder).  Goals are meant to push us to become better.  This one's mine.  Will it be yours???

"I am now 5 weeks post op TKR . This forum has been very helpful to me as I struggle with so much pain, lack of sleep, loss of appetite, shortness of breath and staying positive. I know I am not alone. How could I have predicted that I was amongst the last patients to have this surgery as we faced a global pandemic? Obviously, hospital visits stopped and the physio department closed. My 6 week post op check with the consultant will be by telephone. I've had to get on with physio on my own in lockdown but of course haven't had any measurements taken.
It's hard to maintain a positive attitude and look forward to normal activities post op when in isolation and lockdown. The TKR journey is not without periods of anxiety about the future. The coronavirus pandemic ramps up these anxiety levels. To anyone else out there experiencing TKR recovery in these extraordinary times we must try to be kind to ourselves. Its a long slog but one day we will be pain free and the pandemic will be over. Stay safe!

"Hey all, I wanted to ask about a some knee pain I've been experiencing.
It seems to mainly manifest when I engage in ""leg extension"" type moves. Not that I do leg extensions on the machine or anything...
It's weird... I could do weighted squats just fine, but sometimes, I'll be sitting on an office chair, and propel myself back, and THEN I'll feel it in my left knee. It's like, a semi-sharp thing under the kneecap.
Possibly related: My knees click a lot. If I'm standing around, and I lightly lock and unlock my knees, more often than not, it'll ""click"" audibly, kinda like the sound of cracking knuckles.
Sometimes I'll feel the aforementioned knee pain more than other times, and usually, one ""click"" will relieve it somewhat.
When I'm climbing stairs, there's no audible clicking, but I can ""feel"" it clicking a bit with every step up I take, and hear like a high-pitched version ripple through my body... if that makes sense...
Is this something familiar to anyone?
p.s. I've scheduled an appointment with a PT, but wanted to get the hive-mind's perspective too.
In general, I have some amount of hypermobility (most noticeable in my shoulders, which dislocate super-easily, if in a precarious position like attempting an overhead squat), and the occasional lower back pain... I wonder if that's all linked, or if this is separate... It'd be good to know if there's an overall thing that's exacerbating this, or if the knee issue is isolated.

"I injured my knee about 4 years back playing football, I twisted around and just ended up on the floor in pain, went to a&e and found I couldn't put weight on it, and it was badly swollen, I never got a proper answer as to what I did, but after a year of following all instructions from the physio, I still found that my knee was giving way during running sports, and I was getting an aching pain after walking for anything over an hour, then about 6 months ago I re-injured the same knee when landing after jumping for a header, I had my knee bent on at first and was in a considerable amount of pain... when I straightened the knee I felt something pop, almost like it was popping back into place? I had massive discomfort, and some pain for weeks, I was told I had partially dislocated my knee cap, again I followed the physios exercises, then bought a bike as recommended, and I've been regularly biking for 2hrs+ a day to strengthen my knee, but 6 months on my knee now gives way alot more often during sports, and it feels almost like my knee is coming apart, my knee sometimes locks when walking which brings me to a full stop, and if I twist my knee quickly whilst putting weight on it I can crack it without fail, I still have swelling appearing at this point... I am also still suffering from aching pains, I was told I should be fit within 8 weeks of the incident, I've had an xray which showed nothing, and I've debated asking for an mri, but I'm not sure whether I should or not?

"Lots of people have posted about depression and anxiety after surgery.  I have a section in my old ""...Another Kidney Stone"" discussion about Post-Operative Depression but it's good for it to have its own...
POD is absolutely NORMAL!!!  It's something the doctors NEVER tell you about.  The condition is most common in people who have had an original body part removed and/or replaced (knee, hip, shoulder, heart, maybe brain someday...I have some candidates for that one...plus people who have had amputations).  In psychological terms, it's a ""grieving"" for something that's been part of you forever and now it's gone.  This is not a conscious act...you don't sit there thinking about your old hip bone or knee joint.  It's all occurring on a subconscious level.
I first encountered POD after my hip replacement in 2009.  Four days in the hospital, six in rehab and then home.  After the meds wore off, I started crying...uncontrollably...about EVERYTHING!!!  Lasted three horrible days and then I called my cousin Greg who's been a doctor since the 60's. ""They never told you to expect post-op depression?""  ""WHAT???""  ""Oh yeah, very common.  Just a Jedi Mind Trick...it's not real.  Just your sub conscious grieving over the loss of an original piece of equipment.""
It was literally a ""lightbulb"" moment.  Once I knew the cause of the depression I could deal with it.  Took literally 10 seconds to body slam it to the floor, stomp all over it and toss it out the window.  It was that easy...at least for me.  Been in IT for 46 years so I can think very analytically a lot of the time.  This was a piece of cake.  There was something in my head that didn't belong there...a fake emotion that was getting in the way of my recovery.  Time for it to go.
For others, the release from the effects of POD may take a bit longer but the result is the same.  All the crying and emotion AREN'T REAL!!!  It's just your mind's subconscious reaction to a very traumatic life event, whether you like it or not...whether you deal well with it on a conscious level or not.  There are still those underlying feelings that come to the surface when we least expect it.  I remember a specific Dove commercial with a mother and daughter that just had me bawling buckets.  There's no explanation of how any one person's mind makes connections that go far, far back and you find yourself grabbing for three boxes of Kleenex.
In the end, you get past it...but why not sooner rather than later?  You don't have to go through this...you really don't.  Now you know what it is...and how fake it is...just toss it.  Apply your mind to the problem and get rid of it.  No anti-depressants, no sleeping pills, nothing.  In fact, the best cure is exercise.  Get those endorphins pumping and POD will be gone in a heartbeat.
If you feel this way, know that you're not alone.  It tried to hit me again when I had my TKR...but I recognized it and booted it out the door before it had the chance to take hold of my tear ducts.  You can do the same.  Recognize POD for what it is...that Jedi Mind Trick.  Control the situation with exercise, healthy eating and activities that don't allow POD to eat at your mind.  In the end, you'll not only be better off, but stronger for the victory.

"Hi everyone, about 2 years ago i injured my knee playing playing basketball. I went to the emergency doctor to get it checked out and after some x-rays he determined that there was no structural damage to my knee and that i probably ""tweaked"" the ligaments(not sure what that means) and that i would be fine. I naively believed him and 3 months later the same thing happened, this time i was on vacation, so i opted to wait a week until i could go see my family doctor. He determined that there was no broken bones or damaged ligaments, because i was not feeling any pain during his physical tests. Because of the time between the injury and my visit he couldn't really diagnose me with anything and recommended some basic exercises for my legs and said i should follow up i had more problems. A year later my knee was still in pain and finally got to see a sports medicine doctor. She determined that i likely dislocated my kneecap both times and that i am suffering from patellofemural pain syndrome. She said that there's not much she could do but recommend some more exercises and refer me a knee brace and to physiotherapy. 3 months later I still have that annoying pain that comes and goes, and am considering physio because i want to play again and start doing leg stuff at the gym. Just wanted to see if others experienced this and how they dealt with it.

"Hi all, in the beginning of last year (2019), I got some sort of calf strain/weakness that I chalked up to a work out injury. After doing a month of the keto diet for health reasons, the calf strain became more consistent. I was able to manage it by stretching, massaging, and using a calf sleeve. In the fall of 2019, I began to train for a half marathon. While the left calf strain would occasionally pop up, the use of a sleeve really helped.
Then I got a bad case of plantar fasciitis after getting fitted for a new pair of running shoes (the fitting involved me running barefoot on a treadmill and running with a numer of different types of shoes). I rested from that injury for about a month before I tried my next long run. The plantar fasciitis did not come back after that run, but the next day, my knee locked up.
I've been to a PT and gotten an MRI. The MRI shows no tears so the PT thinks it could be IT band syndrome or patellar tendonitis.
I've tried the stretches and exercises associated with treating all of these symptoms. However, I'm still dealing with the calf strain and the knee pain and discomfort. The calf strain has been around for about a year, while the knee pain has been around for about two and a half months.
Does anyone have any ideas what might be happening? I've tried resting for weeks at a time but these still appear to pop up. Any help would be appreciated!

"I am hoping for some advice, this forum has been very helpful before. I had my left knee replaced in 2017, right knee in 2018. I have been working hard to make life easier for myself, I have lost 3 stone in weight and go to the gym 3 times a week. Unfortunately I am now finding that I wake up at night with left knee pain which I haven't had previously. As soon as i get up and stretch it, it is ok. My right knee hurts when i do certain exercises. Do i bother the doctor again to get re-referred to the surgeon or is this common & i have to put up with it? I'm only 53 so woukd prefer to not be in pain for years to come.

"Hi,
So I had knee surgery in August of 2019 and have been out of work since July 2019. Today, I started working again and even though I didn't do much movement today, it's more than what I have been doing in the last 7 months. Coming home from work today, I noticed that my knee was hurting, which I was expecting, but my leg muscles are really sore. I have been riding a stationary bike 3 times a week lately so I wasn't expecting my legs to be as sore as they are. My question is: is there anything I can do in the coming days to ease the pain until my body and muscles build up strength again? Also, is this a normal thing to go through? I was expecting to bounce back really quick but I guess I was expecting too much from my body. If it matters, I'm a 25 year old female. Any advice could help.
Thank you!

"I had my TKR in September and it has not been recovering well. I had an ultrasound in late November that listed a bunch of issues with the knee and suggested an MRI for the knee. But I wanted to wait and see if the knee would improve, but it has not. I called about an MRI today and they said that the metal in the knee would blur the image and make it useless. I have not heard this, so I wanted to see if anyone else has had an MRI on their TKR.

"I noticed about a month ago that there was a little bump in my knee on top of my patella. It feels just like if you were to put a pebble in my knee. It is hard and dense. It is pretty superficial and isn't attached to the bone. It moves freely. It's pea sized and you can't see it. It's still under the skin. I went to my physician and they ordered me to get an X-ray. They called me back and said they were not able to see anything on the X-ray so it isn't bone or cartilage. They ordered for me to come back in a month to see if it has grown any. Other symptoms I've had are that the outside of my knee was really itchy on the skin but I don't know if that could be related or something completely different. It doesn't give me any pain at all but I can just feel it in there as I walk. Has anyone ever had something similar? Thank you!

"So I had a meniscus tear surgery in January 2017 and they also cut the lateral ligament as my patella was popping over my femur and shredding the ligament. I still have some swelling to front and back of knee and difficulty squatting (sharp pain) and pain at the meniscus tear. My biggest issue is the pain on the lateral part of my leg; just above the knee going up into my thigh about 6-8 inches. It is a dull ache most times, but it has been waking me up at night and been a constant visitor the last week or so. No new injuries (aka didn't twist wrong or fall etc). When I had my surgery they cut away the meniscus tear (only had 2 mm of meniscus at the time of surgery and it is anterior) and my patella was not tracking correctly, hence the lateral ligament being cut. I have a small baker's cyst behind my knee still.
Anyone else experience this?

Back in early December something happened to my knee, I was sitting watching TV like in the picture, I usually like to cross my legs like that, although it hurts a bit after a while because I've never been very flexible, and I usually (or used to at the time) cross my left leg because it takes longer to start hurting and I can flex it better.
So that afternoon I had my right leg crossed and it started to hurt, I didn't mind for a couple seconds and then out of nowhere I watched it over extend and go further than it would normally go, and felt as if something suddenly got lose, I can't remember if there was sound because the TV was on and I quickly hit the floor with my shoes anyway.
There was no immediate pain or swelling, actually it never swelled up. There was some pain during the next couple weeks, to the right side of the knee (the outside part), and shooting pain that went up to the middle of my thigh, it felt like something was being pulled from the inside, like a needle to the middle front of my right upper leg.
There was a burning and somewhat electrical sensation like a vertical strand across the whole knee, that felt a little bit more to the right each day, like it moved, until it eventually settled down on the right side of the knee.
I have felt some instability, I have been able to bear weight, but if I am to stand on one leg it feels a lot more secure with my left leg than it does with the right leg.
Weeks went by and felt considerably better, I have no problems standing or walking although I have been careful no to cross my right leg. The only thing that never went away is a slight pop that feels and shows whenever I fully bend my leg, it happens just to the right side of the knee and does not cause pain.
I have noticed though that whenever I use my knee a bit more, for example I tried biking the other day, emphasis on I tried, I still notice problems with my knee. First it starts feeling cold/like it burns, to the right side of the knee, same place as before, I would say it's a 3 inches tall 1 inch wide area, and random sudden needle like pain as well, I also noticed my knee cracks a lot if I'm laying down and straighten my leg in the air, which doesn't happen with the other leg.
So, what would you say is going on?
For the record I was never into any medication, not even OTC, or medical supervision during or after the injury.

"So im 17, almost 18 and out of the blue i get this knee popping.
As for my bio, im 6'1 and around 155. Male
Started randomly and now everytime i go up steps my right knee cracks. Like when you crack your fingers. It hurts when i put all of my weight on my right leg and hurts if i really use it when i climb steps.
I think it might have something to do with me training HEMA (think historical fencing), which requires alot of knee usage. I didnt take a blow to the knee on my last class so im really confused, its not due to injury. It started one morning. I stopped going for the past 20 days because i thought it might just go away if i let it rest. But nope.
Ill be visiting the doctor this weekend but do any of you have any idea what it might be? IT would be a REAL bummer if it was some sort of arthritis. At 17, yikes. And i never did any drugs, and neither do i smoke or drink.
Thanks in advance guys!

"Hello all,
I had my TKR of my left knee about 4 months ago and just wanted your opinions about where I am in recovery. I'm able to walk between 5 and 6 thousand steps a day, in multiple walks. and can keep a pretty good stride, at least at the start. My issues are that the knee gets very tight, very fast. I can still bend it with some effort but my balance starts getting a little out of wack. I can go up stairs fairly decent as long as I don't overdo it. Downstairs is very hard still...I can do some but it's hard to do them properly. I'm still experiencing a fair amount of pain....nothing that I can't handle though. Oh, also have lots of clicking while walking. Do you think there is anything to worry about at the 4 month mark?
Thank You,

"Well I am now 4 days post operation on my left T K R had my R T K R in April 2018 I do however remember it's a long journey.
I went in on Wednesday and home Friday.
I was doing good with the walking but after philosophy on the Thursday they got me to go up stairs and down 15 steps and then pushing my knee to 90 degrees and trying straight leg lifts several times before discharging me I now have a knee so swollen I find I struggle to get any bend.
Having gone through this before I am not so concerned as I now know when the swelling goes down the movement increases.
They say not two T K R s are he same this one has been better as I am getting more sleep at night but it's still a brutal operation.
I have to go back in 2 weeks time for physiotherapy and know they will say my lift and bend is not good but this time I know once the swelling subsides it will come back.
at the moment it's like hitting a brick wall

Surgeon said to quit outpatient PT and do exercises at home 1X a day, every other day. Will also ride my recumbent bike. Does this seem feasible at 8 weeks? My PT was kind of surprised but said I am doing well. The problem is, I dont feel like I am well with this terrible soreness and gripping tightness that wont leave. The tightness is really bad at night/first thing in the morning. And exercising doesnt really loosen my knee, seems to tighten it more. I know its still early......physician doesnt want to see me back for 2 years! So I feel like I am on my own and anything I say, he says, takes up to a year. He does give his patients his cell phone to call and ask Qs, so that is a good thing. I have to start back to work thursday (office job) and am dreading it.

"Hi, do you think I should see a doctor, or it will overcome itself. A week ago, I crossed one chain between the pillars, stepped wrong, stumbled, the point is that the right leg caught and the chain and left leg lose balance so I fell on it as if with all the weight. For the first two days I had barely walked, but even there it improved from day to day.
Now on the left leg I slightly curl and feel more pain in my knee and surroundings when moving more. Right leg the one I tripped on the chain there I have a big bruise that goes across the perimeter of almost my entire leg.
The problem is that in my legs and in peace I feel as if tired, weak muscles. And for the last three days, I woke up one night feeling pain in right leg, tonight I woke up as if tingling the heat in my leg muscles and hands? hard to describe it as I fell asleep again immediately . Is it serious and should I go to the doctor or should I wait?

"It has been 4 months now since my op for a partial knee replacement and I just don't think I am improving as I should. My operated knee is fine apart from still getting some stiffness and it still feels a bit swollen and sore sometimes but although I can get about unaided I still don't feel confident walking very far without a stick and if I try to I tend to end up limping and waddling! I still get pain from my other knee but I am on the waiting list to have that one done but I had really hoped I would be walking better by now. I tend to get tightness and pain in my hamstring area and pain at the very top of my leg at the back where it joins my buttocks, I also get some nerve pain and pain in my lower back. I have some good days when I feel everything is on track and then the next day I seem to go backwards. I still struggle to stand up from sitting as it feels stiff and painful. I know I have to be patient but shouldn't I feel better than this by now? Before my op I was in a lot of pain from my knees when walking but I didn't suffer from all these other pains that I do now.

"Hi all,
I recently tore my ACL (unsure on degree of tear or collateral damage as I'm having my MRI on Saturday) and was just doing some casual mock karate kicks (normal, I know) and my knee buckled beneath me. The last time it buckled was twice on the slopes when I first did my knee in.
I'm really unsure as to whether this may have caused more damage, as my consultant does not think I have fully torn it and I would like to avoid surgery unless necessary (as I live an active lifestyle, I am aware that this may be necessary).
If anyone has any clue as to whether my recent knee buckle could have damaged my knee further, it'd be brilliant if you could let me know!

After the second operation last week, the physiotherapist just said walk little and often and seemed to be encouraging me to walk outside as soon as possible using both crutches.
Just wondering what other people did in their early days of recovery. I am doing my exercises regularly which are quite excruciating at the moment.

"Since my TKR on my right knee in 2016 i have suffered a rubbing or chafing pain under and to the left hand side of my knee. At times the pain is so severe that i feel as if something is going to come through the side of my knee. I have no such pain when i sit or lay - it only occurs when my knee is weight bearing at the walk. x rays & scans have not resolved this - apart from an ultrasound which showed the ilotibial band is impinged under the prosthesis. However the Consultants do not seem to agree that this could be the cause. My knee is constantly sore but becomes unbearable when i start to walk.
i n desperation i ask has anyone else out there suffered anything similar?? & perhaps have had the problem resolved? Any such information would be gratefully received.

")I have developed Myositis ossificans after TKR on October 30th. If you want to know what it is you can Google it but a quick explanation is the muscle above my knee has gone rogue and it is growing bone and attached itself to the femur.

I am at 100 degrees bending but that is incredible painful. The muscle will not flex. Not sure what they will do if it is still growing when I go back on the 6th. Walking is very very painful. Dr said it is so so rare... Trust me to cause trouble! Hahhahah That is what the surgeon said....... Has anyone ever heard of this or experienced it?

"Hi everybody, I'm from Cornwall , UK . I'm 64 & 5 weeks p o L TKR ( RTKR Jan 18 ). Most of us visit this site because we have a worry or two that what we're experiencing after our ops is not normal & so looking for some reassurance. i have done this many times & have been greatly comforted by advise i have received from fellow sufferers ( especially Chico_Marx ). Anyway for once i just wanted to share something positive ! Here goes.... for some years, i have not been able to master stairs alternately, whether going up or down, inside or more embarrassingly outside, always one one, two two, three three & so on. After i had my first TKR I thought I'd be ok, but because they straightened my leg also, I was then left with one leg longer than the other & limping around like a wind-broken snail ! (Cornish saying) Now I have had my other knee sorted & leg also straightened (I'm upright now, yay ! ) Ican now climb the stairs alternately ! I don't know if other parts of the world give the same PT advise, but in the UK we're told ...UP...good(leg first) go to heaven....DOWN....bad (leg first) go to hell....I have always done that, but as my leg is less painful now, i decided to swap that around to work those muscles. Worked a treat ! I shall certainly be up & down regularly now. Hope I haven't bored you with this long-winded tale, but I was just bursting to share my good news with someone ! Good luck to us all with our recoveries. Bye bye. xx

"Hello,
My Mothers knee used to give way……kind of “Kink” and made her stop walking.
Then she went to doctor and did some physio and it hasn’t given way since, but still kind of “juts forward sometimes”
She kind of presses it at the front and says that “puts it back in”. She has been to see the doctor but he says just avoid carrying heavy shopping.
Does she need an x-ray? Or an MRI scan?

"Hi, this may not be a serious injury, but about a week ago playing sport my knee collided with someone elses - it did hurt initally but i was able to continue. About 18 hours later it became very painful and was slightly swollen, and then also became bruised - at this point i struggled to walk. A week later the swelling is still there (seems like puss) and the bruise has spread around my leg, however it only hurts very slightly if i bend my leg right back. I was wondering if this is something that will heal over time or whether I should arrange to see the doctor.
I have attached a photo which may help.

"Hi all, not been on for a while had a left TKR back in September 2017 and to say recovery has been a roller coaster is an understatement. To cut a long story short i got an infection under the tibial plate which caused it to become loose, unfortunately this was discovered until a year post op as i was constantly being told that what i was experiencing was all normal a bone scan proved it wasn't. In May 2019 I had a first stage revision with dynamic spacer done and recovery has been really tough. i have now found a physiotherapist who is absolutely fantastic and i am finally feeling that i am in control of my rehabilitation. I have been getting a lot of pain in the medial aspect of my knee when weight bearing, I was thinking there was something wrong with this temporary implant so saw the consultant who confirmed there was no infection and the implant looked good. It turns out that its the pes anserine tendon (goose foot) caused by weak muscles due to walking incorrectly for years, so ive gone back to basics and targeting specific muscle groups that are at present, non existent. After just 4 weeks of seeing this physio i can now walk relatively pain free. I have still got a long way to go but this is just a message to people out there that are struggling, never give up and keep doing your exercises . Take care all sue x

"In April 2018 i had a total knee replacement.
I took it too far and ended up in a wheel chair it was the longest 6 months of my life waiting for the operation.
At the time it was noted i had osteoarthritis in my left knee and had a x ray February 2019 and was referred on to see a consultant which i had in April this year.
he looked at the x rays and said a follow up was needed towards the end of the year.
I went on the 12 Dec last Thursday and i have had more x rays he said i need a total knee replacement and has said the operation will be 12 February 2020 which is not too long to wait.
I do get some aches from my other T K R and he said i was putting more weight on it to compensate.
The same surgeon will doing the operation and i am satisfied with that.
So it looks like another few months of pain next year.

"Hi All,
I tore my ACL in March this year, while I was sure the ACL was torn as had suffered an ACL tear 10 years ago which required reconstructive surgery, the doctors ect dragged their heels in diagnosing and only confirmed it and informed me of the next steps in September. As I mentioned, I've previously torn my ACL and had reconstructive surgery 10 years ago which involved the surgeon using part of my hamstring to form the new anterior cruciate ligament. On this occasion they have informed my that I will need to have a 2 stage operations, the first being to remove the old ACL and fill the tunnel holes in my bones.
I am just wondering how long I will be off work during this recovery period? It would seem that the general recovery period is 3-6 months before the second part of the process of reconstructing my ACL can take place. I know when I had my ACL done 10 years ago I was off work for 4 weeks so slightly worried that if both stages require me to be off work for a total of 8 weeks that for me and my family it is a lot of money I cannot afford to lose out of by only being paid SSP.
I know everyone is different so times will vary but hopefully someone can give me an idea of the amount of time they had off for this procedure.
Many Thanks,
Rob

"I am age 84 and am suffering a lot of pain from severe osteoarthritis in both knees (walking bone on bone) I have had two lots of cortisone injections which worked like magic. However, I saw a consultant who has recommended TKR on each knee. He also wouldn't OK another lot of injections before my op' as there is a risk of infection. I can see the point of that but he then told me that his waiting time was eight months and it was much the same for all of his colleagues. I am now scarcely able to walk, get very little sleep and am in pain for most of the time. I have tried Co-codamol but it makes me sick, as does Tramadol and I can't take NSAIDs owing to stomach problems so I take Paracetamol, which does practically nothing. The thought of being like this for probably eight months is unbearable and all I can hope for is that someone will cancel and I can get treated earlier. It makes me wonder if I will still be around when they send for me.

"I had a total knee replacement about 10 weeks ago. Everything was going well at the end of week 4, I could do an 30 minutes twice daily on the bike and walk a couple of kilometers. But, I also suffered a blood clot around the same time, which cost me a week on the bicycle do to the pain and uncertainty about my condition.
After about a week I was back on the bike, but the knee was not as fluid as before and it would stiffen up with exercise. The physiotherapist was not much help with this issue, as she was obsessed with straightening my knee. This just made the knee painful for days afterwards and was not helping my stiffness. The stiffness has gotten worse and I am lucky to do two bike sessions a day now, as the knee stiffens too much.
I had discussed getting an ultrasound with the physiotherapist, but when I asked, she declined. She said my knee felt fine to her. LOL. I went back to my sports physiotherapist (previous life) to get the ultrasound. The ultrasound was inconclusive, but the doctor forwarded it to my surgeon and I got my follow-up bumped up.
The other odd thing is that my knee makes noises when I bend it. It sounds rustling leaves and originates from the ligament that passes the outer edge of the kneecap. It's so loud that other people can hear it. It is not painful, but is likely contributing to my swelling. This is the same ligament that experienced pain when the physiotherapist was trying to straighten the leg.
Any ideas? I assume it is related to my exercise break due to the blood clot or even a side effect of the Xarelto. It could even be the phase of the moon and I'm sure the surgeon won't have much to add.

"I am a 72 yr. old that has been dealing with this pain for the past year that was recently exacerbated by more than usual walking while being caregiver to 68 yr. old sister with Alzheimer's. My doctor just doesnt seem to understand nor even recognize the intensity of pain that drives me to spend a lot of time in bed. I have been seeing a chiropractor and when he gets my sacroiliac back where it is supposed to be so I can walk properly the pain is relieved for a few hours! Yesterday my doctor came up with the idea that I probably just needed a bilateral knee replacement??? How she came up with this I have no idea since she has never ordered any films, mri, etc. My chiropractor explained to me that he believes my pain is coming from discs being squished due to spine curve and rotation and is nerve pain. If this is true, what would knee replacement do as I was under the assumption that it is not of benefit for nerve pain. All I know is that this past year I have gone from an active Senior to an individual who has spent more time in bed than she has being a motivated individual able to help others. What do I do?

A year down the line I posted this:

Twelve months ago, I was sobbing,talking to myself in the bathroom mirror,asking myself why on earth had I agreed to have a TKR. I wished I never had had it done.
My leg was so swollen, the pain was so bad and the exercises were almost impossible to do. Trying to bend a knee which was swollen to twice its size is not easy.
With lots of help from the brilliant advice on here I managed to cope.
After six weeks of weekly physio provided by our NHS here in the UK I was left to continue my knee journey alone. My doctors at my local surgery just distributed painkillers.They weren't really much help.
My biggest worry was the inability to do all the exercises because of the swelling. I decided to just do what I could when I could and keep icing. After six months I still had pain and could only bend to ninety degrees.The more I walked on my knee the more pain I had.
The swelling had gone down quite a lot so I was able to do more knee bending exercises. My consultant was always there in the background if I needed him which I shall always be grateful for. He told me that he never discharged any his patients whilst they still needed him. Our NHS is brilliant when it works.
A few weeks ago I started riding my bike( power assisted) again.Yes, I felt a few painful twinges in my knee as I pedalled but I felt good.
As for walking, well I'm fine as long as I don't do too much. A couple of days ago I walked two miles up and down hills in our local country park. As I had not done that since my I had my new knee it did start to hurt.I think I overdid the hills.
The cycling did improve my knee bend so yes it can still improve twelve months down the line.
Am I glad I had a TKR? Now I can say yes I am. My knee will always feel 'mechanical' but I can walk most of the time without pain.
Recovery after TKR is not the same for everyone, we recover at our own speed.
So to all those just starting their TKR journey all I can say is just hang in there, it does get easier. Don't be put off when you read that someone is back at work, running again and pain gone after a few months. They are the lucky ones how I wish my recovery had been as fast.
The down side is that other knee has now started to 'go'. It is very painful at times but I really want to avoid another TKR but only time will tell.
PS I'm seventy eight years young.*
Well five weeks ago I had a TKR on my left knee. I knew it was going to be a struggle and so painful but I now know there is light at the end of the tunnel.Again I pop on here for support and encouragement and it's keeping me going.
So far I think this one is going better than the first, my husband says I am further on.
My bend is 90 but my knee straightening has a long way to go. I have been into town today doing a little shopping and walked quite well with only a stick but I have a limp. It was painful but not too bad.
I'm icing and elevating at the moment but so pleased I was able to get out of the house.
As for exercising I only do what the pain and swelling will let allow me to do. I am focussing on straightening and bending my knee. Physio is practically non existant. I went last week, he gave me a couple of exercises which I already knew about and then gave me another appointment in four weeks.
From previous experience I know that the bend and straightening of the leg will continue to improve for the next year or so I am not worrying too much.

"I had a partial knee replacement 6 months ago. It was awful at first then after 6 weeks or so there was some improvement and by the 2 month mark i felt i was making progress, despite still suffering from a tightness and strange 'digging' feeling in my knee. I did the physio religiously and was walking regularly and using the exercise bike. I even climbed a (small) mountain in August with my trekking poles. But over the last 2 months things have gone massively backwards. My knee is permanently painful, feels tight inside and whenever I do exercise it swells up and the back of my knee is agonising. I have that horrid 'digging' feeling and get very painful pulling and twanging of the ligaments around my knee.
I went to see my consultant 10 days ago and he said the x-rays are fine and my knee should be fine. He sent me away saying 'treat it normally' so the next day i went for a 3 mile walk. My knee swelled and the pain was so bad i have just had to have a week off work (i am a teacher). All the symptoms i have described above are present despite being prescribed strong anti-inflammatories by my GP and using a TENS machine. I am at my wits' end. I KNOW there is something not right with this knee replacement but my consultant says he doesn't understand it as the xrays are fine and thinks it's just nerve pain. But nerve pain doesn't cause swelling!
This op has ruined my life. Before i was a keen hillwalker and very active. I was still walking despite my knee problems but this op has made things worse. I am in way more pain than i ever was. I need to go back to work tomorrow and have no idea how i'll cope. I have asked my GP to help me get a second opinion but God knows how long it will take. I am so depressed and it is affecting my husband and two young children too.

"hi, i am on day 12 post op for my 2nd knee surgery. had 1ST in may 2018 and it went well. i have osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affecting my hand joints at the moment. on day 2-3 post op still in hospital i developed low grade fever, not constant it varied with and without meds like paracetamol but never higher than 38 C( one occassion). they did blood tests and CrP AND sedimentation was elevated but Crp was elevated even before surgery and they said it could be due to rheumatoid arthritis. for this blood works they said both can be also elevated due to trauma of surgery and coupled with low grade fever i was released home on day 8 post surgery and told fever is standard post op and because there is some bruising and a hemathoma that could be causing it. i asked how long can this last but wasnt given a clear answer. my surgery was done under spinal epidural and some pills that put you to sleep so it wasnt classic anasthesia where you might expect your body flushing meds out, at least not for this long . since then i had low grade fever continue but also extreme night sweating- literally drenched waist up (no sweat smell) several times a night. my daughter insisted i do urine test for uti as i had catheter with my gp and she felt my urine was darker and smellier and test showed high leukocytes count so gp put me on antibiotics. now its day 3 of antibiotics, i finally have some feeling in my bladder ie feeling full and actually needing to go. but fever and especially sweats and general fatigue remains. gp assured me these symptoms should resolve with antibiotics but while i see some bladder and urinary tract progress i still dont feel well at all and now really getting worried its something far more complicated. the wound looks ok and dry, still a bit swallen and there is a haematoma thats starting to look better a bit. My fever is rarely over 37.5, yesterday it started late afternoon and evening and resolved on its own; today i just had to take paracetamol for pain so it went down from 37.3, i am trying to not take paracetmol for pain as trying to see if at least fever is going away but finding it difficult as obviously there is pain especially at the back around the calf and knee itself; also night sweats wake me up and when i measure temp after- its low- 36.3 to 36.7. this is such a different experience than last surgery and i am really now starting to get worried and super anxious and i havent slept in days which isnt helping with recovery obviously. any feedback or experiences from you guys with any of this would be greatly appreciated.

"When standing up from my sofa this morning, I had sudden excruciating pain behind my knee which prevented me from moving it even slightly for an hour (even to adjust my sitting position) . As it was not improving at all I contacted my local minor injuries unit. Whilst on the phone the pain suddenly 'went away' and I was able to move, bend and bare weight on the leg. I didn't experience any 'popping' sensation and the knee area continues to feel a bit fragile, but not painful. I don't understand how the pain could go from so severe for an hour to nothing in seconds, without any treatment or movement. I can't find anything similar online, and minor injuries suggested I contact my GP to check my ligaments, although my GP practically laughed me out of the surgery as by the afternoon I had a full range of movement and could stand on 1 leg without pain. This happened once before approx 10 years ago (I'm 28 now) but only lasted a minute or so, so I didn't get it checked out, and is also why I didn't seek medical help as soon as it happened today. Does anyone have any experience with this? TIA.

"I had both knees replaced 4 years ago. Recently I experienced pain and swelling in my right knee. My ortho's office scheduled me for an appointment with the ortho's assistant. After X-ray and cat scan I was told my bone was compromised and I needed a revision. The assistant put a needle in my knee to draw out any fluid to check for infection. No fluid, no infection. They told me I needed revision surgery asap.
I had to go to a different ortho dr. for an ankle problem on my other leg. I mentioned I was having revision surgery after only 4 years. He said ""that shouldn't happen"". I asked him why and he never really answered me. I spoke to a nurse friend and another doctor( not ortho) who is a good friend and both said the same thing.
I have yet to see the doc performing surgery. Now I am scared. Did my doctor screw up? Is my other knee going to be ok? I did insist they take an x-ray of my other knee. Doc assistant said it was ok but I'm not sure just an x-ray will show all that it needs too.
I called the office and insisted on an appt. to see the actual doctor. He is supposed to be one of ""the best"". I should mention, I did have excellent results with my original replacements until this happened. But now I'm not feeling very confident about any of this. Not sure what to ask the doctor. I'm sure he wouldn't want to say if he messed up. Should I try to find a different doctor...delaying my surgery I need asap?? Perhaps a doctor specializing in revisions? Any good info would be appreciated. I am so confused!

Dear Doctors my mother has been suffering from DVT for a long time. Its in the whole body but her legs are the ones affected the most. She cant walk properly. She is always in pain. A few days ago she had sever pain in her Arm at night and when she pressed firmly that part of Arm where the pain exactly was it was no more not more than 2 minutes later. Was that a DVT? Anyways its the legs that we are worried about the most . I also want to tell you that she was very addicted to eating raw rice. She ate too much of it. One day she was walking properly and the very next day she had pain in her legs also she didn't have the craving for raw nice anymore when she suffered it. Is that the reason she got DVT? She has got like 100 of mini clots in her legs and it happened after that day. Before that she had mini clots but they were not as many as they started to appear after she had sudden pain in her legs. The knees hurt the most . Please help me out what kind of doctor do i need to consult regarding this?

"Hi! Today is 3 weeks since I had a left TKR. I'm doing very well pain wise and can bend to a full right angle an slightly more once stretched a few times. I can also walk upstairs normally with a little effort. However, I've noticed that within a short space of time of doing my flexing exercises (which are very uncomfortable /painful) I can feel everything around my knee tightening and ""shortening "" again. I'm talking literally within 5 minutes or so, even if I continue to walk around afterwards. I do bend my knee and walk as normally as possible but can still feel this tightening. It's as if everything I did had no effect at all. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm just worried about developing scar tissue that'll need dealing with.

"I saw my surgeon yesterday and he took one look at my bend and said he would manipulate it, but not until I was at 12 weeks so that is in another 3 weeks from now. In the meantime I've stopped physical therapy so that I will still have some left for after the manipulation. I had got to 105 under force, but I think that under my own steam I'm only making about 90. My apprehension comes from the fact that his nurse told me they do it under a general rather than an epidural - because it's such a 'rough' procedure. My heart doesn't do well under general anesthesia.
I'm so tired of all the ups and downs - a big up because I made 105 and then a big down because I couldn't keep it. Feeling up because the medication is working one day and then down because the pain is back the next. And now I don't know whether I should be up or down - up perhaps because it might finally get bent and down because of the anesthesia worry.
I don't really have a question. I just know that you are the only people I can talk to who understand.

"hi , i was due to have knee replacement 2 years ago but it was cancelled and since then i have lost 3 stone and been on cortisone injections every 4 months in the last year - this has really helped me and lasts about 2 months before gradually wearing off .
However my surgeon has now said he cannot carry on with injections as you can only have a maximum of 4 and now he needs to do a knee replacement - i thought you were allowed up to 4 a year and not 4 in total - anyone else gad these successfully for more than a year ?

"hi
its been 3 weeks since my op, im doing better than i expected walking wise, im getting about without my crutches, (in the house,.....using just one outside)
im experiencing pressure on my knee cap, it feels like im pushing against a brick wall with my knee, and the pressure is immense, did anyone else experience this. i feel like the metal is trying to push my knee cap out, the surgeon had to file my knee cap.
also back pain and crunching sounds in my spine...i had problems with my spine years ago and had 20 injections, and has been fine up to now ( arthritis and degeneration of the lower spine)
im now concerned that whilst my new knee was being operated on that while they were manipulating it they pulled on my spine, could this be a possibility? Also having bladder problems since the op too..

Since then i have had alot of constant pain, struggle to go up and down stairs unaided and cannot do straight leg raises.
Spent a day or so in A and E and the consultant was very unhelpful - see you in six months!
have since researched and spoken to surgeon in france - it seems i have an issue with the popliteal tendon and from what i can gather, you can have a procedure to release this.
Has anybody heard of this or had the same issue?

"I had double knee replacements April 2017!! Best decision ever!! I was nervous & scared however I got through it without any problems, until recently! This past summer I finally felt comfortable squatting, yes something I've not done since at least 2 years ""before"" my surgery! I have not however been able or rather comfortable with kneeling yet. I just can't not because I'm not supposed to but because it bothers me to put complete weight. Again not because of anything wrong it's me, at least that's what surgeon says. Ok getting. back to reason for my post. I have been squatting alot lately working out in yard. For the last 2 weeks my left knee hurts same way it did when I tore my meniscus. I've read here that with TKR I don't need to worry about meniscus tears anymore!!?? So...does anyone have any ideas as to what or why this is happening? I know one thing it's definitely from squatting!! Any opinion is appreciated. Thank you in advance!!

"5 weeks ago I had a total knee replacement, operation went well and was discharged after 3 days. Given lots of information before procedure and what to expect after surgery. I had been prescribed Codeine x2 and Paracetamol x2 x4 times a day and liquid morphine for night time if needed. I stopped the liquid morphine almost immediatley as appeared to be hallucinating. I received a call from the hospital asking how I was and if I had any worries just ring the ward, which i did a couple of times. I did have trouble getting more medication and was in a position of nearly running out. The medication wasnt on my usual list so had to make numerous calls to the ward, doctors and chemist. I cut down on one Codeine and appeared to be doing well. District nurse came out after 2 weeks to take out the staples and had to wait another 3 weeks for physio. I felt quite confident with my new knee and after 3 weeks walked comfortabley around the house with no crutches and no pain in the actual knee cap. i took the steps to walking around the block again with no crutches. I did the exercises as often as I could and was pleased with how I was doing. The Physio suggested i cut out the codeine and use ice packs instead. i tried this and after missing 2 tablets I was so uncomfortable and stiff I had to go back on to it. I am wondering how long I will have to take the medication, I am doing everything I can to help myself but I seem to have hit a Platue......I know its a long process and I have to be patient but sometimes feel once surgery is over one has to look after themselves and left to their own devices, did anyone else feel the same....

"I have done everything my surgeon told me to, did all the months of PT and home exercises. I still cannot walk down stairs normally. In September he told me to stop PT and home exercises as well and he said he said he would see me in December , my one year anniversary. In 2 days I was so swollen and stiff it was like I was losing what little I had gained.
I got a second opinion. The surgeon asked if I had had a physical o my knee since the surgery, I told him the other surgeon rarely touched it. He pressed o it, had me lift it bend it. Then all of a sudden he put one hand on top of the other and ""cracked"" my knee. It was so quick and forceful it shocked me. He never said he was going to do it, really scared me. I was so startled I didn't even ask why or what he did. He suggested trying to drain fluid from it. Taking blood work, nothing that sounded like it would explain why I was 10 months away from my surgery and still in so much pain. He wanted to see me in December.
The next day my knee felt different. It felt loose, the swelling came and went, I had spasms. It was and has been getting worse than it was before I saw him. I waited a week and called and told them I wanted to see him and get an xray. Has anyone ever had this done to their knee? I am afraid he really screwed it up. I see him Monday and wonder what to ask? What did you do? Why is my knee worse?
I do NOT want another surgery. Any ideas greatfully appreciated.

"Lets see 10 months in. leg is still swollen, hard as a rock at times. Pain is almost as bad as it was right after surgery. I went to PT, do home exercises not having any improvement , it is actually getting worse. Still can't do stairs comfortably have to have stair rails or I am going no place. When my knee is swollen it is painful to bend over and pick up anything. It hurts all day every day, Never under a #7 for pain.
I got a second got a 2nd opinion and this surgeon had NO IDEA why it was still swollen and painful this long after surgery. He took xrays, said everything looked good and in place. He suggested a few blood tests, it is not infected. was going to drain fluid, but said there was not much there. It gets really hot at times.So now he is saying he will see me at a year year and a half. This is my Life now he tells me. NO IT ISN'T""T!!! I refuse to give up and settle for a lifetime of pain and swelling. Not an option. I can't be the ONLY person this has happened to. I have tried compression socks, they go above my knee roll down and apply a tourniquet to under my knee. Before my surgery I was told the blood in my leg was pooling. The Cardiologist did several painful needle procedures that all failed, one he had to abort as he was hitting a nerve every time he stuck a needle in my leg. He said I had Venous Insufficiency. He wanted to do both legs. Up to this point I had no problem with my leg other than the knee. A friend 's daughter had the same procedure ,on the same day, both knees,a week later they were all swollen looked like my knee. She was diagnosed with Lymphedema, Do you think that's a possibility? What kind of Dr.would I need t confirm it???? This was in reply to one of Chico's posts. He suggested I repost it to see if I could get some feedback. Thanks in advance for any insight.

"hi guys I've been dislocating my knee since I was 11. when I was 16 the hospital did a lateral release and I was told it would never happen again. well it did two years ago my father in laws dog ran into it. Last friday it came out just by me bending down while standing straigot I wasnt twisted I didnt turn it was straight forward down motion. I went to the hospital today the consultant didnt touch it as it is still sore and I have pain going to the bottom of my foot and my ankle. The consultant said there are many operations I could have and all the physio I could do, however this wont guarantee that it will not happen again. I want them to take the leg above the knee. I am a mother of 2 and my job requires me to be on my feet and bend and sometimes kneel. Am I being silly for wanting this to be done with once and for all. I'm now 32.

Nothing showed up. Over the next 7 months I had steroid shots, physical therapy, and an ablation. Nothing worked. On 8/13/19 I had a revision. I can walk, drive, and do PT. I can't get up and down without having terrible pain. Now I have excruciating pain in my kneecap, ankle, and on both sides of the shinbone. I am absolutely miserable, can't sleep, and can't handle the stress this is causing. Narco is like taking a baby aspirin. My ortho surgeon says it's normal. What are your thoughts?

"Good afternoon, I thought I would take my time to start trying to find answers myself as seeing doctors hasn't done anything.
Two years ago I was swimming, hadn't been in a couple of months doing nothing intense just normal laps when suddenly I felt something buckle in my knee, I felt a lot of pressure and when I went to get out of the pool using my right leg to climb up the ladder I couldn't do it, it felt like I had completely lost all my strength in my knee. A couple of weeks after the incident the pain was still very intense, feels like pressure and it worsens when I walk and at it's absolute worst when climbing up and down stairs.
I decided to see a doctor who felt around the area and said there is nothing abnormal about it. So I pushed further and so far I've had an X-Ray and an MRI scan on my right knee and nothing has shown up what so ever and I'm rather concerned about it. The pain also gets a lot worse when I'm sitting in one position for too long so travelling is very hard especially in a car or plane that doesn't have enough leg room so I can stretch it out.
I've been given various pain medication that doesn't even touch it now, there is nothing that soothes the pain unless I use marijuana which I rarely get to use being in the UK it's very hard to buy. I've been on various CBD's too such as vaping oil, oral tablets and the drops.
I've always been physically active but since two years have passed I've gained a bit of weight because I can no longer run or hike like I used to and it's taking its toll on me mentally now especially with the doctors being clueless as to what it actually is.
The knee feels like theres a lot of pressure built up inside it, it begins to hurt so much I sometimes feel light headed and some days I can barely walk, it comes and goes which is odd. I'd say I have about 2 days a month where it goes completely, but steps are still very hard.
I was wondering if theres anybody who has had this or knows of this who could lend me some help? I'd very much appreciate it.
If you need more details I'll be happy to try and describe it further.
Thanks!

"Hello, I had a Partial Knee Replacement 13 weeks ago. I can straighten my leg ok and my leg range is 120. I am really concerned with the really bad pain at the back of my knee. It can be crippling and the stiffness in the morning is upsetting. I thought I would be without pain by now. If I sit down for any length of time it can be difficult to get up without pain. I am going on a 7 hour flight soon and dreading it. is anyone else suffering with pain at the back of their knee. it's really getting me down.

"i injured my knew in high school by falling wrong. the doctor told me that i had an MCL sprain, i believe, and i never received any form of rehab for it. my knee occasionally gives me slight discomfort, and i've noticed i can not be as explosive when i play sports anymore and can get overpowered by smaller people. my knee has had a couple episodes where it feels like it popped out of place, while playing intense basketball and i had to straighten my knee in order to feel like i could walk again. people tell me that i have a slight limp and i've noticed that i swing my left leg to the outside while walking instead of bending the knee and moving it forwards. it also makes a popping sound when i straighten it, and if i elevate my left leg and lunge it creates a type of grinding sound. please help.

"hello everyone
i was expecting it to be very painful afterwards and it certainly is, what i didnt expect was the pain in other parts of my leg, i think its sciatica pain, and also the back of my knee feels like theres a big lump which makes lying down very uncomfortable. (there isnt a lump just feels like it)
yesterday the district nurse came to take my staples out, i told her i was worried as it was only 11 days, but she said it would be fine, it wasnt, apart from the excruciating pain which ended up making me feel sick and light headed, the wound opened up...she has put sticky tape over it and will come back tomorrow for another go. im dreading it, my knee feels worse than before and theres not as much movement, but im also frightened to bend it incase i open the wound more...oh the joys of TkR ..
i had to come off my HRT before the op which has caused my hot flushes , night sweats, to come back, my emotions are all over the place, im crying like a baby, its just ridiculous how sorry i am feeling for myself.
i came out of hospital feeling great, i got out on day 4, came home and could even mange the stairs no problem, ive been out on a very short walk, and really felt i was making great progress, everyone commented on how well i looked, now i feel like ive taken a step backwards...i saw a chart someone on here had posted and its so true its peaks and troughs..
can i ask how you all managed to get to sleep...im so sleep deprived, id giveanything for a good nights sleep.
i do know in time it will get better, im 60 and my 86 year old mother has had both her knees replaced and she was an inspiration to me as she coped so well, her second one was just last year,
is there anything i can do tomorrow to make the staples coming out any less painful?
thank you for taking the time to read this, i was looking for a support group and hopefully i have found one xx

"Hello, my first TKR April became infected so 5 weeks later reopened washed out and spacer changed. That time my ROM was 110 and going well before the infection set in. After May operation my knee was totally stiff from above the knee to my ankle, like being wrapped in a very tight bandage. I was on antibiotics for 4 months whilst microbiologist at the hospital tried to decide what was going on. Turns out the bacteria found inside my knee was one that lives on the skin and of the family that causes acne. My leg was very swollen physio was very tough, ROM got to 80 after a lot of work, but I can get no further. My leg above the knee feels very pitted and dimpled, and the scar looks black, over the knee the scar changes from pink to livid purple during the day and my knee is sore and painful. When I press it it feels lumpy. My bloods show infection indicators have dropped, but the surgeon and microbiologist have adopted a "" watch and wait"" approach and review me in clinic. I am worried I will not get a good ROM bend back in my knee, I cant drive my car, or sit on a bus without my leg sticking out in the aisle. And the scar colour worries me. Back seeing the surgeon next week to review. Has anyone else had these problems. My other knee needs a TKR but I cant commit whilst like this.

"Hi,
I had a knee replacement approx 4 years ago which went very smoothly. I had some aches and pains but they seemed to disappear quite quickly
A couple of weeks ago I went out shopping in a pair of shoes which were basically too loose and since then I seem to have been suffering from muscle aches around my knee which I am quite concerned about. I did have a small amount of stiffness on the outside of my knee on and off since the operation but it did not trouble me too much. However over the last couple of weeks I have resorted to using the ice pack again.
It does not help as I was planning yo have my other knee done in a few weeks but am now having second thoughts. Has anyone else had issues from wearing shows which were unsuitable or have any words of wisdom.

"Had tkr on my right knee end of May this year. i am doing fine, going up and down stairs normally, better than ever. Still some stiffness which just about disappears when walking, but when i sit at the computer for even 30-40 minutes it stiffens up. Also in the evenings when I'm mostly sitting around. Once i get up and take a fee steps it mostly disappears. My question is, do others experience this? I know it can take 12-18 months to be - hopefully - pain free, but just want to know if inactivity causes stiffness in anyone else. No problems in bed - I sleep flat on my back and have done for years. Stiff getting up in the morning, but that quickly disappears.

"Almost three weeks ago, I had knee pain in my right knee. I hadn't had knee pain in years, so i got worried. I play soccer, so for two weeks I played 4 games with practices every day without a game. I didn't notice anything bad until my knee began to swell and bruise. I haven't played in a week, but the issues are still there. (I saw a doctor and just got an MRI on Friday.) I don't have major pain when walking, but its difficult to walk correctly. My knee feels very of, i cant bend it like normal and it feels very wobbly. My main question is about my foot. On the same leg with the injury, i got numbness and pins and needles in it. I noticed that my toes are in a curled position, which isn't the same on my other foot. I've been having problems bending and straightening my toes. I'm not sure what this means if it has anything to do with my knee. If someone could please let me know what to expect or what it means. I get my MRI results back on Thursday.

"i am nearly 7 weeks post op partial knee replacement. i have been making slow but steady progress. however the last fortnight i have been experiencing a new pain.
On walking i am having pain all the way up the leg starting from my ankle, through my tibia, fibula & calf into my knee. It is so bad i feel like i could rip my whole leg off! It feels like the most intense pressure ever along with a very deep ache x1000
I was on one crutch but have had to go back to using 2 again.
i have had my 6 week check up but with the clinic running late my consultant had to leave and i was left seeing a nurse. she had no idea what it could be.
i have had 5 previous operations on said leg including a high tibial osteotomy followed by metal work removal a few years before this!
Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms or any idea what this could be?
Many Thanks

"18 months ago I had a plate and screws implanted for a fractured femur. I also had a partial knee replacement done on the other leg 10 weeks ago. Everything sort of settled but yesterday out dog walking I had pain in my left thigh where the plate and screws are. This morning I still feel it when walking around the house. I am hoping that this will be a temporary thing but am obviously concerned about this. I was busy yesterday so am hoping that I have just overdone it. Should I be worried?

"Hi everyone.
I wonder if there is anyone who could maybe share their experiences with me.
I am 11 weeks post LTKR. When I woke from surgery, I had extreme swelling all the way down my legs and into my foot (I am sure I am not alone here!!) I had a terrible feeling in my big toe and the next toe. It felt like a had a rubber band tightly fastened around the two toes, constricting them.. I also had a feeling like a thick rope wedged between the two toes. As the swelling went down, this feeling subsided, but has never gone away. I constantly feel a light tingling in these two toes, along with a ""thickness"" in all of my toes now, and it feels like the ball of my foot is swollen. It also has this ""thick"" feeling"" I do have feeling in the ball and toes, so it's not numb. When I walk, it always feels like there is something stuck under my foot. When I wear closed shoes, it is evident that my left foot is still slightly swollen when compared to my right foot. I also still have slight swelling in my calf and ankle.
I discussed this with my surgeon when I had the feeling in my two toes, and he explained that it was possibly because of the extreme swelling in the knee that the nerve running down the left side of the knee was compressed, resulting in the feeling I was experiencing in the toes on the right of the foot.
My ROM is 118 flexion and 0 on straight leg. I still have swelling in the knee.
I really am concerned about this strange feeling This is really affecting my post op depression. I am trying to hard to kick this depressions but, but am not being very successful.
My next visit to the surgeon is November 3, and I will discuss it with him then.

"almost at 12 weeks post Op flexion and extension seem on track - 118-120 increasing an extra 5% with painful assist.
biggest issue is cannot control the swelling at all even immediately after ice , soon as i stand it starts to blow up on both knees.
been told to work hard on regaining strength on quads but the swelling restricts this.
actually standing up for any period od time is worst
starting to wonder how to move forward and not become frustrated. icing 5-6 times per day every day and PT twice a week as well as my own daily in home exercises
any tips on the swelling ? hard to find people having both done
feel if i can stop muscles fatiguing can push on and start walking but as is still need an aide when outdoors

"Hi I am 71yrs old
Had a TKR about 18 months ago and seem to be doing very well. The first 8 months i went to Gym 3 times a week doing Bike, Rowing machine. Cross trainer. Treadmill. Leg extentions, knee curls and leg squats.
I have been playing Tennis for the last 50yrs and the consultant told me i should be ok to carry on playing after the operation.
Anyway last February i started back playing indoors with the Evergreens once a week and last April started playing competitive Tennis at my local club all Summer. (Only doubles never singles lol)
I now play 2 times a week indoors and sometimes once a week outdoors.
I still go to Gym once a week. I set myself a goal 18 months ago to play tennis. It was a lot of hard work at the beginning, but know i am very happy. I think the secret is to never give up and aim for something which you can achieve. Each person will have different expectations.
I am not saying i am fully 100% recovered but am at least 95% and i know my limitations on the Tennis court . The first 2-3 months after the operation are very demanding and at times you wish you had never had the operation, but as i said earlier never give up and it does get a lot easier. Also walking is very good for the Knee.
I hope this gives a lot of inspiration to those who have just had the operation or those waiting.
Always think positive and you WILL achieve

"Hi
Replying to Roberta73 and Seamus
When i was in hospital for 3 days, they gave me Ibuprofen, Paracetemol and 1 tablet of Oxycodone (Morphine derivative) every 4 hrs which relieved the pain. However when i came home i was only prescribed Ibuprofen and Co-Codamol. I took these every 4 hrs day and night, but found sleeping at night a problem and ended up on the sofa with a pillow under my leg and sleeping on my back.
After 2 weeks i asked the doctor for some other tablets and she prescribed Tramadol.
I tried these for 2weeks but they were making me feel lousy so i stopped taking them and just used the others. I persevered and once I started the Gym the pain became less
After about 4-5months i was only taking pain killers very rarely and was sleeping a lot better in my own bed. About last October i was managing to sleep on my side without pain during the night and stopped taking tablets altogether. Obviously playing sport again and Gym work your knee does ache at times and I get the odd twinge letting me know i am doing too much. I may then just take an ibuprofen tablet which seems to cure it.
I stay to people just be careful what you do and use your own common sense as your new knee will never be the same as before, but a lot better than you expect.
Good luck with the pain medication.

"Hi, I had a total knee replacement two weeks ago and I am really suffering with lack of sleep. The problem seems to be within fifteen to twenty minutes of being in bed , the continual throbbing pain in my heel / back of ankle . i have been doing the exercises and moving ankle about ( now finished blood thinners yesterday) , pillow under heel ( not behind knee of course) , in fact everything i can think of . It's not easy sleeping on ones back having never done that and wonder when one is able to sleep on non- operative side with a pillow between. I have an appointment with the Physio next Wednesday so will ask . Bruising is quite colourful , even foot at the side is quite black . Pins and needles to foot is annoying, i suppose it will take time for nerves to heal .( Did have some prior to surgery tho due to some peripheral neuropathy, caused by the chemotherapy for breast cancer in 2016)
I am literally having about two hours sleep at night and to say I'm feeling low is an understatement . Any advice , patient experiences on sleeping would be very much appreciated.

Yesterday, I stood up and felt a sudden pain and weakness leaving me with a limp. Today while sitting it unexpectedly 'clunked' and Ithought maybe had gone back into position but it is now throbbing and still weak.

"I'm 20 years old, female and I recently sustained a knee injury. My right knee started hurting about 4 weeks ago following an intense workout routine. I am not overweight or anything, but I do not workout very often.
I felt a certain tightness in my knee every time I folded it all the way or dipped into a squat, which I do very often. It was painful but only when in those positions, and I did not experience any swelling or difficulty in walking, running, or sport (I play badminton leisurely).
Two weeks after that, I went on a hike. Strangely enough, even before I started on the hike, my knee tightened up even more so it hurt to walk even, but the pain faded away after a few minutes.
After the hike, I played some badminton and everything was fine. It was a few hours later that I noticed a swelling around the knee. After this, I had trouble bending it at all or even straightening it.
It's been two weeks since, and my condition hasn't exactly improved a lot, but it has definitely changed.
For the first 3-4 days I couldn't straighten the knee without pain, and I had to elevate it frequently. Now elevation and bending hurt, but straightening is fine. Swelling is still there, but it has reduced. I cannot run, jump nor make many sudden movements. I find myself massaging the knee a lot because pain comes and goes frequently.
I've seen a GP and orthopedic. No bone injury (had an x-ray). The ortho confirmed an effusion. After a lot of pulling and stretching, he noticed pain on the right side of the knee and mentioned something about a strained ligament but failed to clarify. The GP ordered an MRI but it's booked for 1 month later, she is conservative and believes I should limit radiation as much as possible so she wants to allow a month to see if I'll heal with time.
The pain is uncomfortable, and I'm really bumbed out because I was going to start playing badminton competitively this month but I can't do that now.
I don't have any diagnosis, and I don't know what I can do to get better (other than RICE). I've tried simple therapy exercise like slow cycling and stretching and that just makes the pain worse.
Maybe I'm impatient, but I just hate this uncertainty and unexplained pain I have to put up with and abstaining from sport.
Any advice as to what I should do to get better? My GP says if the pain is too much she'll get me an MRI sooner, but what kind of measure is 'too much'? I don't know what to make of that. I can walk and drive my car, but the pain is very frustrating.

However, for the past week or so, I find that when I sit around in the evenings there's some soreness on the outside of the knee and sometimes a bit of an ache in the front of my thigh. Does anyone else get this? I know it's early days and everyone says a year and even 18 months. I tell myself that it's healing going on inside my knee and that I'm more aware of it because I'm sitting quietly (usually!). I have no pain at all in bed (I sleep on my back and have done for years) so at least I can sleep at night. I do my PT exercises daily.

"About 7 years ago, I had a sports injury. I was 13 at the time and had to have surgery to fix it. I broke the top section of what I believe is my tibia. Pretty bad injury, wheel chair for 6 months, rehab for 3, and full brace from my ankle to my hip.
About 2 months ago i noticed a pain i get when getting up from a chair. The only way I can explain it is like a fault line having an earthquake. Once I move my leg and bend my knee a to a point, it feels like what would be like pressure releasing, almost like a bone hitting another bone then snapping away from each other. It has been getting worse to the point where I stood up in pain and had to completely stop what I was doing. I consider myself to be above average for pain tolerance, as my sports background and construction work life goes.
I will be making an appointment soon to have It checked out, but would love to hear some thought on what this might be before I go in. Wondering if a bone spurt has grown from the surgery. I am in no way a pro in medical health, just concerned at this point. Thanks to everyone in advance.

"I had TKR 4 weeks ago. Feel very tired and weak. I'm sure it is due to very little exercise b4 surgery for several years. I have needed and still need help with meals, etc. I am doing PT but I'm sure not enough although today my straightening was at -4 and bending at 117.
I do what I can. I am staying with a friend at his house because all on one level and he has been helping me and taking me to my PT appointments. Most of the time I've been sleeping a lot due to the drugs.
My question is about going with him on a 5-6 hour car trip. If I don't go I won't have his help. PT told me too soon to go. I will ask my surgeon. I know about the possibly of blood clots. Has anyone else gone on a long trip soon afterTKR surgery and if so how did you handle it?

"I tore articular cartilage in my right knee and had micro fracture surgery in December of 2017. It lasted a little over a year before having more problems and continues to grow worse. I am having another surgery in a few weeks. We believe the repair has failed. I know the patella has frayed and will have to be shaved down for the third time in two years and will have cartilage loss in the knee. I wont know about the articular cartilage until after the surgery. If it is articular again my doctor says he may not be able to do anything. I am too old for growing the cartilage in a lab, since i have defects in both the femur and patella i can not use doner bone and cant harvest my own cartilage to be moved over and i am too young for a knee replacement. I am 45 years old and play a lot of tennis. What are my options? should i push for a replacement? are there other surgeries?

"Hi,
I am yet to see the doctor, I will do it, but I wonder if anyone would have a clue on what is happening with my right knee.
The knee hurts when I lie down, extend my leg and keep it contracted for some seconds. It also hurts if I stretch it like that when I am walking and, in such situation, my right knee, completely extended (if there is not even a slight flexion), supports all my weight (not much at all, 165 pounds). The point of pain is on the inner part of the knee, around the patella, but clearly on the upper part of the knee (maybe at the very end of the quadriceps?)
Excluding those situations in which I rigidly extend my legs completely and on purpose (when lying down or walking), I feel some intermittent pain that comes, lasts for a couple of seconds, and then goes away. That can happen when I am lying in bed, standing up, sitting. The pain is on the same place I have mentioned before (sometimes, it seems to move to the other side, but 90% of the time it's on the inner side). I am not sure, but checking anatomy images, I would say it would match the Medial retinaculum or it would be very close to it.
I stopped running about a month ago, but half an hour on the running machine until then did not seem to make things any worse (maybe because I would never fully extend the leg when running?), as staying away from it do not seem to make things any better. Much worse is doing some abs that need full extended legs. Other than that, the issue appears by itself from time to time, or it appears whenever I extend the leg rigidly or press the tender point. I would say that when the pain comes by itself that would be level 3 out of 10, but when I touch the point and mess with it it raises to level 5 for half a week.
I also have the feeling as if there were some slight pressure on the knee, as if it need more room inside, and I feel it warm on the pain area.
I have full movement of the knee.
I am sure I pushed things a bit too much on the last months. I've ran too fast sometimes and I went 6 days per week to the gym. I am not running anymore and reduced the gym and all the weights by half.
Other than that, before I could see that something was going on, I've tried some preparatory exercises for lotus position, I've saw that it made things a lot worse and I quit it. It all seems so stupid now, but unfortunately only in retrospect.
Does that picture look familiar to anyone?
Thanks

"So, I'm 11 weeks post RTKA. It has been amazing, truly! I have RA so a lot of my joints are pretty trashed, but my right leg is already my good leg! I'm at 0°-130° and my therapists discharged me four weeks ago. Everything has just been awesome.
Until last night, when I was putting clean sheets on the bed. My husband has a bit of a clutter problem on his side, so places to step are few; I tripped over his laptop cord and had to step hard at some weird angles to keep from falling. It was a little sore last night, along with my left ankle (which doesn't have any cartilage left) but I figured it would be okay this morning.
Nope! It's a solid 6.5-7 on the pain scale with any weight bearing and it refuses to go straight. The pain is focused on the inner back of my knee. This is a new place for it to hurt. I'm forced to use a crutch today (and I hate that!) It's also noticeably more swollen than the other knee.
Has anybody else had a similar problem? I was planning to can dill pickles today, but, well, I think it's a couch day. I can't take nsaids but I did take 5 mg of oxy and 1000 mg acetaminophen, and I'm firing up the ice machine. Hopefully somebody can tell me they also had this happen, and it'll be fine in a day or two!!
Thanks in advance! Hope everyone is having a great day!

"I had a PKR on May 17th this year and experienced some issues in the early stage of recovery, particularly swelling and pain in the thigh most probably due to the tourniquet. Since the week 5 mark, things have improved significantly. I now have almost full ROM, I can cycle, walk good distances, swim and do stairs and hills. I can even kneel (though it hurts a bit). I've done lots of work to rebuild my quads etc.
However, my knee still doesn't feel right. It feels heavy and tight and like it doesn't belong to me. It's like it's a mechanical body that's connected to me by tight elastic bands, so while I can bend to 140 degrees quite easily and do all kinds of activities, it's just not comfortable and I am constantly aware of it and feel every movement.
Also, I frequently experience great discomfort below my knee cap. Frankly, it feels like the edge of a spade or shovel being pushed up under my kneecap, without severe pain but with all the discomfort. This is most notable after activity. I also still get quite a bit of pain in the back of my knee, odd painful twinges below the knee and the whole knee itself is still tender to the touch, as though it's bruised. Furthermore, it's still fairly swollen and wearing narrow legged trousers is blooming uncomfortable as my knee rubs against the fabric and feels so tender.
To be honest, apart from the absence of the horrendous crunching sound I had before the op (I had no cartilage left), my knee doesn't feel less painful than before the op. It feels rather more stable I suppose (I don't feel it would give out on me) but I am definitely in greater discomfort (and pain really) than I was pre op. I know it all takes some time but many people seem to be jubilant that they are pain free post op, but I just can't claim that. I wonder if perhaps other people had much more pain than me pre-op (I was still managing most activities, including mountain hikes pre-op) so the improvement in pain is felt more quickly by them? Or is something wrong with my PKR for me to be feeling these things?

"Just coming up to 8 weeks post op and thought I would write of my experiences so far. All going in the right direction with various healing pains/sensations along the way. Exercises have been invaluable but at times very difficult to get motivated due to bouts of tiredness but have persevered. Easy to overdo things as any slight improvement makes you think you are sort of back to normal but there is always a sharp reminder to slow down. I think the main thing is tiredness which seems all part of the recovery process. I hope this helps anyone in a similar situation.

They tell me at PT that I am on schedule with my physical therapy however, I feel like my energy and joy were zapped out of me since my surgery. I just cannot seem to get it back. I did have some difficulties with headache, nausea, diarrhea and a weird feeling in my head for about 10 days after going off of my pain med. I did gradually wean myself off. I had been on it for about 2 1/2 weeks.
I guess I am just reaching out to see if anyone else had any of these symptoms going on for them. I am a teacher and scheduled to go back to work next week (7 wks out). I am a little apprehensive about it as I don’t know how I will do and I’m feeling some anxiety over it

"9 years ago when I was in jr high I started having knee pain. I went to therapy and braced my knee for a good three years. My freshman year of high school in 2015 my doc did a fat pad debredment and a lateral release. In 2017 I had pain again so a diffrent doctor (because I moved of for college ) gave me a cortizone shot (my 2nd). It helped for about two weeks. The pain is stedely getting worse. Fast foward to 2019. I had what a MRI done and my doc said there is a small cohndril fissure and tendonitis, also my tracking is good now. My fat pads scar tissue is causing some of the pain. My doc said not enough to constitute sugery. Which is fine. The pain is very limiting, I cant get any releif. Nor can I do the things a 20 year old should be able to do. Im open to any and all advice anyone can give. Thank you in advance!

"I'm about 11 weeks out from Total Left Knee Replacement...I've had significant pain from ankle all the way up to the top of my thigh. Many nights I wake up after 3-4 hours of sleep in horrible pain....OTC meds haven't helped at night. Massaging or kneading is somewhat helpful. I'm unable to get comfortable in bed...no amount of pillows, wedges, or propping helps. it is less bothersome during the day if I pay very close attention to icing, elevating and medication.
Once it starts, it's very hard to get back under control. I'm supposed to return to work in about 12 days and am unsure how I will manage due to the nature of the work ( correctional facility) and location ( secure facility). The thigh , calf and ankle pain are worse than the knee pain prior to surgery......I've heard Lyrica may be helpful for nerve pain. Other suggestions?

"I'll try to keep this short. In November I started feeling some weakness in my left leg. I went to the doctor he did a general once over and said it was nothing. A few days later after getting out of the shower, I noticed swelling on the backside of my leg behind my knee. When feeling around, felt a small pea sized lump I head back to the doctor, get an ultrasound for suspected Baker's cyst. They said it is not a Baker cyst and nothing showed up on the ultrasound so they sent me for an x-ray and that also came back negative. I kind of let the issue go and recently it has crept back into my mind because sometimes my leg will ache with full pain. The weakness has started to come back and I'm a little concerned that this may be something. Anyone experienced anything similar? Any thoughts on what this might be?? Would an ultrasound pick up anything of a concerning nature?
I'm a natural worry wart and over analyze everything.

Am finding it weird that every time I go to poop I feel really nauseous. Have vomited at times. Do not have this any other time. Am not constipated or got a bug. Thought it might be related to Rivaroxaban blood thinners that on for another 7 days. Was on Tinzaparin injections until sent home with Rivaroxaban tablets 3 days ago. Had no issues with Tinzaparin. Not on any opioids as only on paracetamol, ice, elevation. Minimal pain compared to other knee. Only issue is this unpleasant daily episodes. Any one else experienced this? Going to have clips out on Wed so will ask District Nurse then. This knee experience is so different to other TKR. Far less pain. Far less swelling. Better range of movement.

I am ten days post op. My knee kept dislocating but I have patella baja ( low lying knee caps) . I am still in agony , unable to bend knee and my leg is so heavy I can not lift it, however I am able to weight bare pretty well, just wondering if anyone knows if this is normal to recovery? I get my staples out in 4 days and physio starts in 5. I am constantly icing and the only slight comfort I get is when leg is elevated. My instructions were only foot exercises and to partially weight bare , which I am doing but I feel I should be doing more. I really was unaware of how painful this would be.

"Hello,
It's me again with a new question. Does anyone know if there is any advantage to having computer assisted TKR as compared to traditional? I have an ortho that has done some traditional treatments on me who doesn't do the computer assisted TKR. I have a relationship with him and have liked what he's done so far. So, would it be worth going with a computer/robotic assist TKR or just stay with the tried and, so far, true doc?

"Greetings fellow knee warriors.
I had a TKR 5 weeks ago. I had my first on my other knee 2 years ago, and as I have a memory like a sieve, I cannot remember the timing of things in my recovery.
I am making progress - no crutches or walking sticks - can go up stairs now one foot at a time rather than two feet per step, and can bend knee pretty much all the way up now.
What I cannot do, is straighten my leg fully, naturally.I can, if I concentrate and push through my quads and make it straight, but when I go to stand or walk, the leg is not straight and I have a little limp. And when I lay down and relax the leg, so that it lies straight without any pillow under it, it gets very uncomfortable after a few moments.
Is it still early for this?
Can anyone recommend what exercises they are using for this aspect please?
I am very concerned that I did not make a strong enough effort immediately following the op. This time, the pain bomb/nerve block they leave in did not work, and the pain management at the hospital was not very attentive or concerned. So I was in a great deal of pain in hospital and was not able to do the exercises with as much determination as I was able to two years ago.
Would welcome any thoughts or ideas please.
Thank you all.

"Hi, the issue is with both my knees. basically my knees have really loud crepitus and they ‘pop’ a lot.
However, I can make them pop in multiple directions.
To start off with I can feel the joint get really tight and the range of motion decreases, I know at that point I need to ‘pop’ my knee to release the pressure.
With my hand I press and hold my knee cap towards my thigh, then flex and extend my lower leg several times. each time I flex and extend I can feel the pressure building just below the knee cap and eventually a really loud ‘pop’ occurs and the pressure/tightness is released. This does not hurt, if anything it does the opposite. If I dont ‘pop’ the joint It gets increasingly uncomfortable.
Now this is the concerning one in my opinion. I stand up straight with both feet on the floor, I put most of my weight on one of my legs, the opposite leg which is still stood on the floor I move towards my standing leg. Im essentially dragging one foot towards the other. At this point Its almost like my knee is slightly bending on the inside ‘medial’ side. I can move it back and forth, I again feel the pressure building and then a loud ‘pop’ occurs. the ‘pop’ is on the medial ‘inner’ side of my knee.
Have you ever known this medial ‘inner’ knee movement and ‘popping’?
I know this isn’t normal as I have spoken to friends and family who have never heard of this before.
I just want to talk someone who has had the same symptoms or treated someone with these symptoms.
thank you.

"So I had surgery on my knee about 2 years ago on my torn meniscus and ever since my muscles haven't been as strong and stable. Until recently, I started doing my knee exercises again and ended up getting recurring knee effusions (suprapatellar) and I've also been having momentary strange knee pains particularly at the back of the knee. I have tried strengthening my quads more but every time I squat, my knee cracks slightly. I was just wondering if anyone knew what the cause of this is and any recommended fixes?

"I had a TKR on 21st November last. In addition, in order to partially correct a walking disability, the lower leg was rotated by a few degrees relative to the upper leg. Due to the disability the leg has never been able to completely lay ""flat"" but since the TKR this situation has worsened and I can neither straighten the leg to the extent that I could prior to the operation, nor can I support my weight on the leg and walk. I feel a lot of the problem is that I have lost a great deal of muscle strength in the leg and in an attempt to rectify this I now use a mini, pedal type, exerciser. Occasionally the knee hurts quite a bit using this, so its use is a little intermittent. The knee is not too painful most of the time, only the lower leg and foot are a bit swollen and this is lessening.
Obviously my worry is will I ever walk again and I would appreciate hearing if anyone has had a similar experience to me and what the outcome is likely to be.
Thanks and Regards,

"I'm a 20 year old female who was diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome in both knees when i was 14. The pain began occurring after I quit cheerleading, which I had done for 4 years. I would say that I experience moderate pain every day and severe pain once or twice a week. If I stand in one place for longer than 5 minutes my knees get terribly stiff and it is difficult for me to walk for some time after that. I've been prescribed naproxen and pennsaid, but they have no effect on my pain. I frequent Walt Disney World at least twice a year and I've had to get a wheelchair on almost every trip because the pain becomes unbearable when I walk a lot. I've had x-rays done a few times and an MRI on only my right knee. I've been to multiple doctors and they all say the same thing: physical therapy. I've been to two separate physical therapists for about 3 months each, but my pain got worse after each round. The last doctor I went to also prescribed physical therapy and I have yet to follow through because I'm afraid it'll be a waste of time just like the other times. I'm beginning to feel hopeless because it has impacted my life for so long now and it seems like it will be the way forever.

"hi. I am new to this forum, and looking for some advice. I tried contacting a second orthopedic surgeon for a second opinion, but he said it is too soon after my surgery. I had a torn miniscus trimmed on May 30th. The pain was improving each day, and then just over a week after the surgery the pain went up to a 9 even when sitting or lying down. I went to the ER with no relief, and saw my surgeon two days later. He said I needed a surgery to clean it out because I had an infection. I had that surgery on the 12th of June, and was started on oral antibiotics after a day in the hospital getting IV antibiotics. I took the oral antibiotics for about 12 days, and I was having a lot t of symptoms that seemed like a reaction so I saw my primary care doctor. He determined that I was having a reaction, and my kidney function was way down, so I was admitted to the hospital for a week. I have been on IV antibiotics at home three times a day since I was released. It is now the 22nd of July, and my pain when I stretch the leg or put any weight on it is worse than it was before the first surgery. I can’t walk without crutches or a walker. I was wondering if anybody else has had similar experiences, or if anybody can tell me if this is normal. My surgeon tells me the pain is from arthritis, which I knew I had, but if that were true I would expect it to be the same as it was before surgery, not worse. Please let me know what you think.

"Request: Where in the United States could we go to get the most effective and EXPERIENCED infectious disease specialist and surgeon to fix a really bad periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after a total knee arthroplasty (TKA)? I want to maximize the chance of a good outcome and avoid options like fusing the knee, or god forbid - amputation.
Condition: Serious bacterial infection of left knee several months after TKA. Infection has not progressed to the blood, or spread to other places in the body at this point, but it is doing real damage to his knee and overall health. It has definitely taken its toll - he is extremely weak & fatigued, can't stand, walk or even roll over. Looks terrible like he's been aged 10 years. His right leg/foot is also swollen. Genitals swollen. After months of misery he's really depressed and feels like he's dying.
We've started a 2-stage replacement, prosthesis removed. Surgeon is not confident he can fix the knee and is already talking about amputation...
The surgeon seems competent but I don't think he's handled a lot of cases like this.
Sequence of Events
Before this knee replacement nightmare, my 71 year old dad was in pretty good shape for an old man: he went to the grocery store and cooked every day, rode a motorcycle and went the the gym 3-4 times a week. He used to be a bodybuilder.
His knees were worn out so he had the left one replaced back in November. It wasn't very well executed... they neglected to get him off of blood thinners 1st so the surgery was long with lots of bleeding, and MASSIVE swelling of his legs afterwards, so much so that the incision would not heal. He was in the hospital for a week, and incapacitated for over a month. Dark black bruising spread all the way up to his waist and private parts.
Just as he started to get things under control around February, his patella became dislocated. This required a revision surgery in April - another week in the dirty hospital.
Late June - He finally seemed to be doing pretty well and could walk around.
Early July - Then suddenly a switch flipped and there was a massive relapse in one day. Unable to walk, confusion, excruciating pain, extreme swelling of knee. Doctors aspirated the knee and determined there was an infection. On approximately July 9th he had a surgery to wash-out the joint.
Suspected pathogen: staphylococcus aureus, but it could be anything. They were unable to tell me.
Initiated IV antibiotics for about a week, infection worsening. He looks seriously sick, is demoralized. Doctors say: ""the infection is winning.""
July 26 - Docs execute a 2-stage replacement
After the 1st stage the surgeon says it's one of the worst cases he's ever seen, the infection has eaten away a massive amount of tissue. He has removed the prosthesis, cleaned out the joint as much as possible, and filled it with a spacer and antibiotic cement. Scheduled for 6-10 weeks of antibiotics. Surgeon is not optimistic about being able to cure the infection and install a new prosthetic joint.
The hospital: I've really lost confidence in this hospital after what seems to be some seriously ""botched jobs."" The hospitals in this state have some of the worst records for MRSA infections, and the doctors give me vague answers when asked about rates of infection in the hospital. They seem to be badly understaffed, and some of the nurses have terrible attitudes and are borderline incompetent. We go for hours with alarms blaring from machinery without being able to find a nurse. The bed is broken and doesn't adjust. The IV machine only works intermittently or they neglect to hook it up... It's crazy. He is constipated for a week at a time and bladder balloons to 1000cc. There have been multiple incidents with nurses trying (unsuccessfully) to forcefully jam catheters inside of him even after they've been explicitly told it can't be done except by his urologist with special tools. (because of his swollen prostate). Could this have been the pathway of infection?
If family members weren't there advocating/taking care of him around the clock... I'm not sure what would happen to him......
Worse, I never felt there was an urgency to get this infection addressed. They sent us off for several weeks without an appointment, no doctoring, until we finally demanded to come in.
In conclusion:
My dad broke his neck when he was young and was exposed to tons of x-rays. It's suspected this was the cause of his neck cancer later in life. Anyways, in the 1990s when he had cancer surrounding his spinal cord he was in big trouble. He had a doctor who was planning to give him the standard chemotherapy/blanket radiation treatments.. My dad had been doing research in a library, looking up names of doctors, calling them... until he found out about some new technology/techniques being used by a doctor at Mayo Clinic - special pinpoint radiation using a cyclotron. He spoke up about it and it turned out his doctor had studied under the Mayo Clinic guy. He asked the doctor, ""where would YOU go?""
The doctor said, ""I'd go to that guy....""
Long story short, he applied for the program at Mayo Clinic and was completely cured against the odds.
This is what he needs for this knee. Where can I find the most advanced care, the most experienced infection guy & surgeon who handles serious cases like this all day long. I don't care how much money it is, I've got to save my dad's leg!

I think I overdid things by walking a total of 7 miles in one day 3 weeks ago. I've not been right since. Pain and stiffness. I'm sure I've damaged the replacement but the physiotherapy department at the hospital I'm under assure me that this will not be the case. Any ideas anyone?

"I was on the hip replacement forum, but just realized I hadn't been there in 2 years. My son had 2 hips done in 2016 and is mostly but not totally recovered. I had many great convos with lors23 and renee01952 and linda38528 and hope they are doing well.
I fired my primary care provider last year because she did not even suggest getting an xray when I told her my knee was popping and crackling.
Got the new PCP, xray and it's osteoarthritis. Now I want to fire my son because he is micromanaging my care. One good thing he found was that I should probably find a patient advocate, because I may not find the right surgeon in Hawaii (small place, limited choice of surgeons), may have to purchase different or more healthcare insurance (to go out of network). He is on the US west coast. Anyone know of a good surgeon/orthopedic group in Washington state? Thank you in advance!
I will be reading up on your experiences, and hope to have a new knee no later than mid next year!

"I had a TKR last December on my right knee. I did have one setback the following April but I think it was due to overexertion after attending a conference. I know the left knee is ready, but was wanting to hold off until October if possible.
NOW.....my right knee is giving me fits! Pain got bad enough I had to use a cane for a few days, and its still not much better after two weeks. Back on low dose pain meds. Dr. says could be because I am favoring my left knee, but it just seems more than that to me. Has anyone else experienced this? Also, he wants to give me Zilretta injection in left knee to prolong the surgery. Anyone have experience with that? I'm desperate for advice?!?!

"Has anyone ever been diagnosed with Pes Anserine bursitis? I've been dealing with medial knee pain for the last few months. X-rays and MRI have been done. At first, the doctor thought I may have a stress ""reaction"". He then referred me to a knee specialist. When I went to him, he said my MRI was basically useless. All he said was ""you have pes anserine bursitis. I'll give you a cortisone injection and you'll be fine"".
Well, the injection has done absolutely nothing. As long as I do not put any weight on my leg, I am OK. The more I walk, the worse it gets. I can no longer even walk around the block without it becoming extremely painful. At times the pain is so bad that it feels as though someone is stabbing me in the leg with every step I take. At night when I lie down, it can take a few hours for the pain to subside.
Anti-inflammatories and Tylenol do not help.
I am at a loss as to what to do. I keep thinking that this is something other than bursitis, but I don't know what.....

"Its been a nightmare for me I had a TKR on 8/22/2017, from the start I had one infection or another. My wound would not close in an area. I had debridement after debridement. On November 13, 2018 I had to have my intial implant removed and the surgeon placed an antibiotic spacer. When I was discharged from the Hospital I had a PIC line and I was getting Vancomycin at the end of December 2018 I started draining yellowish fluid. At that point they admitted me in th Hospital 1/30/2019 to remove the spacer so I had no implant so Iwas bed ridden and I had MSR
( Mersa)so anothet pic line and DAPTOMYCIN. So that did not work then theygave me TEFLORA & RIMPANFICIN Ispent 6 months in the Hospital. On April 30, 2019 all infections cleated & I got my new implant (REVISION). I was transferred to JACKSON North for rehabilitation my wound had NEUCROSIS. so at this point we are now on SURGERY #12.

Just takes time I was told. 24hrs a day, every waking moment I get no relief., while it is not extremely painful, it is very uncomfortable and disconcerting. I can't wear decent shoes because of it. It doesn't ever get any easier so always conscious of it. Does anyone else suffer constant pins and needles so long after surgery. I need my left knee doing as well but I cant face it again.

"4 months ago I got my right knee replaced and all went well. doing all my exercises 3 times a day and walking as prescribed by my physio. then at about 2 months when walking down the house stairs my knee gave way. I was almost at the bottom so didn't fall that far, the problem is that the way I fell my knee was bent right back and touched my backside. after about 10 minutes of feeling sorry I managed to get up and all seamed to be OK. the next morning I felt very stiff and phoned 111 to get some advice. they said to go to A andE. and get an x ray to make sure that I hadn't damaged the implants. all came back as good and nothing wrong but left me with a pain above my knee cap. at 3 months I got my left knee replaced and am now 6 weeks in, totally perfect. when I walk I am struggling with my right knee, I spoke to the consultant and he checked it out and said I had a fault there. I had an appointment a week later to see him and he said just to keep it. when I went to see him the second time he said that I had possibly torn the muscle. problem is that when I try and extend my right knee it's like an exposed nerve in your mouth and you no what that's like. SO does it sound like torn muscle or damaged implant if it is muscular what if any exercise could help sort that out?

"Both kneecaps have dislocated since the age of 11 (now 35). TTT and MPFL reconstruction on right knee stopped the dislocations and the left knee just seemed to behave itself - until April this year. Kneecap dislocated at Easter, referred for physio by the GP. Kneecap keeps dislocating and the knee keeps buckling from under me as well as constant pain. The physio says that they think I need surgical intervention and that the problem is again with the MPFL, they say that physio will only provide a temporary fix to a more serious underlying problem...........is it common to have exactly the same problem with both knees? Or are they just erring on the side of caution given my history?

"Hi all. I've had problems with my knees since the age of 11 (now 35) both kneecaps dislocated for the first time at age 11, eventually fixed in right knee with TTT, Lateral release and MPFL reconstruction. Left kneecap dislocated about 12 weeks ago for first time in 15 years and since then dislocates again about twice a week.
Physiotherapist has told me I need surgical intervention and in her opinion the MPFL is the problem.
GP has referred me (14 week wait) so I have managed to secure an appointment at a private hospital with an orthopaedic consultant and being seen in 2 weeks.
On my referral letter the GP has stated that I have congenital knee dislocation, I've not been told this as a diagnosis before and I'm unsure what it really means and what can be done.
Does anyone have any experience with this and could offer me any advice?
I'm really struggling with this as I feel as though I am back at square one like I was with my right knee, work is being affected and I am struggling when looking after my 4 year old.
Thanks very much in advance x

"Hello, I am 9 weeks TKR ( second attempt, first one 4 weeks before but became infected, so reopened and washed out) . My knee is very stiff and feels hard. The swelling is going down but I have a burning sensation all the time. I can extend my leg and lay it flat just about, but bending is another matter. It gets to about 85 and I can not bend it any more. It feels like a very tight band from mid calf to above my knee and it just wont give any more. The physio tells me to keep trying and that it will come but its really worrying me. I cant drive again yet its too uncomfortable, and I cant sit properly on a bus as I cant get my leg in behind the seats. I have to extend it into the aisle. . Has anyone else had this problem. Does a stationary bike help at all no one mentions this. Any reassurance would be appreciated or suggestions, as this is getting me down. Seeing the surgeon again in 3 weeks he is monitoring how the infection has affected me. Still have not got the all clear from the microbiologist yet. What a worry.

"7 weeks post op and I have been finding walking with or without a crutch challenging because I felt my knee buckled and felt unstable even though I have been religiously doing exercises and using the stationary bike to strengthen my weakened quads. Prior to the op I did lots of hillwalking and used trekking poles to help with my total lack of cartilage and subsequent pain. Yesterday, I decided to experiment with walking using my trekking poles rather than a crutch. What a revelation! I only planned on going round the block but my gait felt so much better and more natural than with a crutch that soon I was in a great rhythm and did 3 miles on off road paths through the woods and fields near my home. It felt fantastic. Yes, I was a bit swollen and sore afterwards, but this morning the swelling has gone back down and I can really feel how it has properly worked my quads and seems to have 'righted' my gait and given me more confidence in my knee! This morning I have been walking around the house with no crutch and my knee isn't buckling like before. I am in the UK and read some articles from the USA on using trekking poles to aid walking post knee replacement which made me think it was worth a shot. Totally recommend it!

"Hi there, I had a RTKA on 6/18, and while it turned out to be more involved than the surgeon had anticipated, I've been doing really well. I've gotten to 0° and 105°, I've been cutting back on my pain meds, and overall I've been really happy with my progress. But yesterday, I noticed that it was more tender than it had been. Today it's more sore still, and one lump of swelling is really hard and much hotter than the rest of the knee. It's a little red, but not bright red, and nothing is oozing from the incision. The steri strips are still on, but starting to peel off. I've been feeling completely awful today and had a violent episode of vomiting, and now it is hurting even when elevated and my whole calf is tender. But my temperature, while up about two degrees, hasn't cracked 100 and as i mentioned, no drainage. Had anybody had this happen and it just passed on its own? TIA!

"The worst of the pain and swelling has finally subsided. Movement and flexibility have improved dramatically in the last ten days. At week four, I forced myself to get to the gym and begin intense therapy. Although still attending doctor approved PT sessions, I was not happy with the results after four weeks. After a few painful gym sessions of stationary biking, treadmill walking, and using the leg /knee weight sled, my pain and swelling decreased together with an significant improvement in ROM from 108 to 119. It felt great to leave the house after a month as well as interacting with friends at the gym. I believe the change in scenery and social contact aided greatly in my recent progress. Pain free living takes time; is very painful; and, requires constant effort to achieve. At age 70, looking forward to the best and healthiest years of my life. Remember, never give up and never, ever quit. Best regards to all my fellow TKR grads. RJ, Florida

"I'm now hitting the 5 month post op on my TKR. At 2 1/2 months I asked my surgeon when I could go back to work. His response was ""I don't know why you're not already."" His manner is very cold. His PA released me with restrictions. My job is housekeeping at a local cabin and motel rental. About 3 weeks ago I made a simple turn on my surgical leg and felt an immediate twisting, ripping in my calf. By the time I got home I could barely walk. I went to my primary the next day and she said it sounded like a strained muscle, wrote me out of work four days on complete rest and lots of ice packs. I followed her instructions to the letter but the stiffness, soreness and twisting feelings are back. I have an appointment with the surgeon next week and am not looking forward to seeing him because of his icy manner. I think it's time for a second opinion.

I'd like to try but worried I'm not ready. Progress for me had been impeded by thigh pain due to the tourniquet but things are improving now. When not swollen, I can bend my knee to 120+ and am just a couple of degrees off a straight leg. However, my knee still feels rather unstable and tends to wobble / buckle when I walk. I also get the odd sudden sharp pain on the inner side of my knee and 'twangs' below my knee on either side. I don't want to put myself or others at risk by driving too soon. Thoughts?

"Hello All,
I'm thinking about getting my left knee done and was hoping for some advice. I can still handle level, fairly even ground pretty good. I have a lot of trouble with it on stairs, especially down. I also have some problems on the hills and can get some serious pain on uneven ground. Pretty much every night the knee swells up but goes down when I can get it up in the evening. So far I can keep on keeping on overall. My question is, should I get it done or should I wait until it's a must? I have seen an orthopedic surgeon and had it checked. The knee is bone on bone and I've been told that it will have to be replaced. Thanks in advance for your advice.

"JUST GETTING USED TO THIS FORUM AND HAVE READ ABOUT LOT OF PEOPLE DOING MUA WITH MINIMAL PAIN. I READ THAT IT CAN CAUSE EXCRUCIATING PAIN POST AND SOME DOCTORS RECOMMEND AN OVERNIGHT STAY FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT. I ALSO HAVE FIBROMYALGIA. ANY FEEDBACK?
Hello:
So thankful I finally found this site as I have been struggling with the recovery process and people understanding. I have experienced being told many times from a knee replacement patient ""when I was at 3 mos this is what I could do"". I simply inform them they were bent the day after surgery. I was only bent 20 mins 2x's per day for 8 weeks. Plus I have fibromyalgia. Anyway . . .
I had a displaced patellar fracture from a bad fall on 1/29 basically splitting my knee cap in half in to 2 pieces. It was closed. I had the ORIF surgery on 2/4 and have 2 screws and the wires - no plate. My pain was not controlled prior to surgery and while I was to be a 23 hour stay after surgery I ended up being in the hospital for 3 days because they couldn't get my pain under control. Following the hospital I went to inpatient rehab for 1 week where I learned how to walk better (used the walker and crutches), how to dress myself, and how to use the leg lifter as I couldn't lift my leg on my own. Upon going home I had in-home PT 3x's per week and I then transferred over to outpatient rehab 3x's per week since the middle of March where I have remained having PT 3x's per week.
I was in a full leg brace with hinges for 8 weeks. I was kept at 0 extension when walking and was permitted to unlock the brace to 30 - 60- or 90 (dr. unlocked further each time I saw him) flexion when I wasn't standing or walking. Due to the 0 extension for so long it led to much difficulty with getting good flexion. As soon as the brace came off I no longer used crutches or the walker.
So that's my basic story. Fast forward to now. My doctor is thrilled with the healing and says I don't need any more x-rays. No arthritis. I am continuing to use a cane only outside of the house. Stairs going up are tiring and at times painful. Stairs going down are tough and I hear clicking or crackling. Pretty consistent pain on the lower portion of my knee especially when standing. The stiffness causes the pain. My PT thinks this is patellar tendon based although there was no damage to any ligaments or tendons. Some of this results in compensation which causes other problems. At times I'm still having pain when walking and rainy days are really difficult pain wise. Despite the months of PT I am still only in the 90's flexion wise.
In addition the head of the screw is protruding so you can actually see what looks like a little outward button on the side of my knee. It hasn't come through the skin thankfully.
So the doctor has agreed and believes that a MUA is a good idea at this point and he will do something about the screw as well/at the same time as the MUA. I am nervous and wondering if I'm making the right decision to proceed. I have heard it is very painful and sets a person back. He told me I'll need the crutches again after the procedure. I have read that some doctors keep a patient overnight for control of pain but my doctor doesn't think that is needed and I'm concerned about that too. I don't know if the intent is to remove the hardware completely or what the story is with that. So I have been writing back and forth to the doctor thru a portal they have to find out more. In addition thoughts on use of the CPM after the procedure? Doctor claims no need.
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advanced for someone who understands and wants to be understood to.

My pain was not controlled prior to surgery and while I was to be a 23 hour stay after surgery I ended up being in the hospital for 3 days because they couldn't get my pain under control. Following the hospital I went to inpatient rehab for 1 week where I learned how to walk better (used the walker and crutches), how to dress myself, and how to use the leg lifter as I couldn't lift my leg on my own. Upon going home I had in-home PT 3x's per week and I then transferred over to outpatient rehab 3x's per week since the middle of March where I have remained having PT 3x's per week.
I was in a full leg brace with hinges for 8 weeks. I was kept at 0 extension when walking and was permitted to unlock the brace to 30 - 60- or 90 (dr. unlocked further each time I saw him) flexion when I wasn't standing or walking. Due to the 0 extension for so long it led to much difficulty with getting good flexion. As soon as the brace came off I no longer used crutches or the walker.
So that's my basic story. Fast forward to now. My doctor is thrilled with the healing and says I don't need any more x-rays. No arthritis. I am continuing to use a cane only outside of the house. Stairs going up are tiring and at times painful. Stairs going down are tough and I hear clicking or crackling. Pretty consistent pain on the lower portion of my knee especially when standing. The stiffness causes the pain. My PT thinks this is patellar tendon based although there was no damage to any ligaments or tendons. Some of this results in compensation which causes other problems. At times I'm still having pain when walking and rainy days are really difficult pain wise. Despite the months of PT I am still only in the 90's flexion wise.
In addition the head of the screw is protruding so you can actually see what looks like a little outward button on the side of my knee. It hasn't come through the skin thankfully.
So the doctor has agreed and believes that a MUA is a good idea at this point and he will do something about the screw as well/at the same time as the MUA. I am nervous and wondering if I'm making the right decision to proceed. I have heard it is very painful and sets a person back. He told me I'll need the crutches again after the procedure. I have read that some doctors keep a patient overnight for control of pain but my doctor doesn't think that is needed and I'm concerned about that too. I don't know if the intent is to remove the hardware completely or what the story is with that. So I have been writing back and forth to the doctor thru a portal they have to find out more. In addition thoughts on use of the CPM after the procedure? Doctor claims no need.
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advanced for someone who understands and wants to be understood to.

"HI EVERYONE
My issue is pain in my affected knee when going from sitting to standing position. I have no pain when walking, just when I bend it my range of motion is above average and none of my exercises produce pain. Just cant figure out why it hurts standing up. I'm 74.

"Hi friends,
Now I am suffering from sciatica pain since 4 months. The doctor took x-ray and found that I have Spine Spondylitis. So he prescribed gabapentin sandoz 300 mg. I am scared to take as I have seen people who took this tablets have swollen face etc.
Have anyone tried this Gabapentine for Sciatica pain? The pain is severe and makes my knees and pain even more now. I can't sit or stand long. If I sit it's difficult to stand and walk. It takes awhile for me to walk . Please share your experiences/ opinions.
Thanks in advance

"My Mum had a total knee replacement 30 years ago at the age of 50.
My Mum's Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon has diagnosed Asceptic Loosening, ie: the failure of the bond between an implant and the bone in the absence of infection. The Orthopaedic Consultant has said a revision could be done but there is no guarantee the operation would be successful. Just wondered if anyone has had this procedure.

"Hello,
i have osteoarthritis in both knees and am scheduled for bilateral knee replacements in a month. This week, I started having ""clicking"" that hurt pretty bad in the outer-back of my left knee. It brought me to tears a few times. Yesterday I have ""clicking"" in the front-inner side of the same knee which causes severe pain and the inability to put weight or straighten the knee. It seldom lasts long, just long enough...or until I rotate the knee in a way that makes it stop. Since they are going to replace them soon, I doubt the Doc will do anything. Anyone ever have this, or have any suggestions? I elevate/ice and use a tens unit when I'm home....no help. I thought wearing a brace would help, but it hasn't, and Im using a crutch just in case while at work.

"Just wondering if anyone else has an elusive surgeon? I am 6 weeks post patellofemoral knee replacement and I haven't seen my surgeon since before the op. I was due to see him at the 10 week mark but they have canceled the appointment and have replaced it with one to see his senior physiotherapist instead. I called the hospital today but got nowhere frankly. How can it be acceptable that a surgeon performs a major op then doesn't see his patient afterwards???? Maybe I'm naive and its standard practice but it doesn't feel acceptable. I'm a teacher and it's like me teaching a module but never bothering to see or interact with my students, never giving them opportunities to ask questions and give feedback and never really finding out whether they are making progress !!! In my field that would be unthinkable!!!

"I was supposed to have total knee revision surgery 5 days ago on my left knee because after I had the knee replaced last year I tore my PCL and the new knee wasn't stable anymore. They were prepared to replace the entire implant but after opening me up and exploring around, they were able to find a different spacer that actually made my implant more stable. Long story short, instead of having to have the entire joint replaced, I only had to have the plastic spacer replaced. I'm already walking around without a walker or a cane. I am so tankful they didn't have to saw on any bone and that I don't have to go through months of excruciating pain during recovery. The muscles are sore but that's to be expected because they still had to open me up and flip my kneecap out of the way as if they were replacing the whole implant. Anyway, just had to share my good news. I'll update my progress in a couple of weeks. Wishing everyone a quick and pain free recovery. GOD BLESS!!

"So I am now into Month 7 and my left knee is actually worse than before the surgery. My insurance has cut my PT off. I went for an MRI last Wednesday on my right ankle. I have a partial tear of my Achilles Tendon. I was so far from the parking garage they took me down to the garage in a wheelchair . We got to the garage I got up , tripped and I fell into the door jamb and clung to it. It happened so fast. I was able to walk back to my car. My podiatrist said I had to stop using the NuStep. In 4 days my knee is no longer the horrible traction pain it was it is now traction2 !!! My knee is hard and swollen, now the right side of the knee hurts too along with the knee and 2"" rectangle area 6"" long.
The podiatrist either wants a cast or something that goes over my shoe. (if that won't make me a fall risk I don't know what will) But as for today I have nothing on it and it hurts too. The surgeon wants to get a look at the MRI CD. Wonder what HE will want to do??? Wonder if the tendon ripped when I tripped? Just so sick and tired of being in pain and tired of having a surgeon that doesn't care and won't prescribe any pain meds at all. I am still doing the exercises, they don't hurt too much but after my knee really hurts.
Hope everyone is feeling better, healing with less pain and healing quicker.

"I had a partial knee replacement just over 3 weeks ago and am terrified because i feel something is not right. I am 45 and was very fit before the op - hill and mountain walking regularly still despite having no cartilage left at all due to congenital abnormality of the patella. Although my knee was painful pre-op, I had full movement and could bend it fully and even kneel but i went ahead with the op as the surgeons told me i would still be able to hike but with less pain.
In the first few days after my op i experienced horrendous pain and tightness in my thigh, so badly I couldn't lift my foot from the floor during the initial physio and couldn't bend to 90 degrees, but they were so desperate to get me out for the bed i was discharged anyway.
The awful thigh pain and tightness continued at home (it felt like I had been machine gunned in the thigh), but with perseverance i did manage to lift my foot after a week or so. I do all physio exercises 3 times daily religiously, walk on my sticks round the village several times a day and follow all exercise with icing and elevation. BUT, I still cannot bend my leg easily. I can just get it to 90 degrees now but it is very very hard because it feels like my thigh muscles are going to snap. They are so tight!!!! It feels like elastic bands pulled so taut they'll snap whenever i try bending it and the psin goes all the way into my hip.
My mum had a TKR and doesn't remember experiencing this. I haven't seen my surgeon since before the op and i haven't seen a physio since discharge. My first physio appointment isn't for another 10 days and i don't have an appt with my consultant until the 10 week mark! I've tried phoning the hospital but never get called back and my GP has just suggested I change my painkillers.
I am terrified something has gone wrong and i'll never be able to bend my leg again and will never be able to climb hills and mountains again. I feel so depressed and 'abandoned' by the NHS (over dramatic - sorry). Has anyone any words of reassurance or advice for me as right now I feel my life is ruined by this op.

"WILL IT EVER END????? Saw the surgeon at 6 months (last month) and he tells me if I do new exercises I will notice a big difference . Maybe not so much tourniqueting. Nothing major. Still afraid going downstairs. Numbness, pain. I had to go to the hospital 2 days ago to get an MRI of my non TKR Achilles tendon checked for a tear. Just what I need now. I get results tomorrow. They put me in a wheelchair as it was quite a long walk to the MRI wing. When they brought me back to the parking garage they didn't get the TKR foot rest moved all the way back and when I stood up I tripped on it falling forward. If it hadn't been for a door jamb and hand rail I would have been on the floor. I didn't hit my knee but must have jarred it. I was so shook up I couldn't find my car and walked around for 10 minutes looking for it. It has been in a tight tourniquet state since then. I haven;t exercised it till today just iced it. Lots of clicking. I am afraid I may have really messed up the tracking. I see the surgeon next week. Should I call the surgeon, wait till after I see if I have torn my Achilles tendon or wait till i see him next week? I see the PT this Wednesday. I am beside myself.

From the time they injected me with preop on Monday morning until my wife called EMT's on Thursday morning I had no idea what was happening. I spent 3 days in the hospital and have no memory of any of it. No clothing changes, no showers, no food orders, no walking, nothing! I don't remember leaving the hospital or getting home. My wife called EMT's on Thursday morning because of my total lack of responsiveness. It wasn't until they arrived that I began remembering where I was and what had happened.

Walking stairs etc are fine
I can put up with the nerve pain - annoying though it is but the muscle pain is really getting me down.
I still have that tightness above the knee which I can feel when walking.
And on standing or trying to exercise the muscles in the side of the leg and thigh are very painful and I need to hobble a few steps before I can walk.
I have good bend @ 130 but only 2 degrees

"Hi all,
I am now 5 weeks post op (partial knee replacement) and still suffering from severe thigh pain and tightness that extends into my hip and groin. It makes bending my leg really hard as it feels like my thigh muscle will snap but I think I can get it to about 100 degrees with strain (It's a bit if a guess as I haven't seen a physio yet and won't until Friday, but it's definitely more than 90.) . The thigh pain is much more than any knee pain. I don't get to see my surgeon until 10 weeks post op but I did finally manage to talk to a registrar on the phone yesterday. He has suggested this could be as a result of the tourniquet used in the op and the pain could remain for several months! Has anyone else had this? I do my exercises religiously and ice and elevate 5-6 times a day but I feel I'm hardly getting anywhere. I'm still having to take codeine which I hate. No-one mentioned tourniquet pain to me pre-op. I feel very cheesed off!

"I am 64 year old female. Was active, did a lot of walking but arthritis took knee to bone on bone. TKR april 2019 became infected may 2019 so knee reopened washed out and liner replaced. Hospital appts every 2 weeks, but do not see the same surgeon / registrar each time, and each has a different diagnosis of whats happening. now 6 weeks since last surgery. They nod and say they are monitoring it, one sent me into a panic when he said they may have to reopen it and wash it out again or replace the whole knee again. I ask lots of questions, they go off and debate but no clear answers. My blood markers are going down. My knee gets inflamed as the day goes on, is stiff and feels like steel bands around my mid thigh and ankle and feels hot. Bend is around 85% and its very painful to try to go more it fixes at that point. COPE nurses visit, and say it will improve over time, but I am very worried that I will not be able to walk properly or very far . There is still a question of low grade infection as bacteria was found in the wash out, but I have been waiting 2 weeks to see the head surgeon who will decide if it needs further antibiotic treatment or not. I take pain relief but sleep badly as my knee feels fixed. Is there hope.

"Hi,
Approximately 7 years ago, I lifted my body off the ground with heavy dumbbells in my hands and once I did this, my right leg made a pop sound and my thigh became very stiff. There was no swelling and after 1 hour the stiffness had gone away. The next day and ever since I've been getting constant clicking/grinding noises whenever I bend my knee, such as squatting or going up the stairs and I have pain/tenderness all around the knee cap. I have no problem fully extending my leg either. About 1 year after I injured myself, my left knee started clicking as well along with the same knee pain/tenderness. The left knee starting one year later was probably down to the fact that the injury had affected both knees at the time of the injury, but perhaps had not affected the left knee as much at the time, but eventually gave way and let itself go.
I had an MRI scan in my right knee and the doctor told me that the result was normal, even though it said I had a minor impingement of the Hoffa's fat pad. I knew that this impingement was probably caused by the injury. I believe I have a patellar tracking issue in both knees and that I need to do exercises and see a physiotherapist to give me specific exercises based on my issue. I have been referred to a physiotherapist for the second time - I was referred the first time 2 years ago, only to get a phone call asking me questions with exercises sent through the post, which made my knees worse! No one has actually looked at my knees in person.
Based on the information I have given, do you think that the minor impingement of the Hoffa's fat pad really is not important given that I have knee pain and constant clicking in the knees? Does it sound to like the main thing I need to do is focus on getting the tracking of the patellar corrected by doing exercises?
Many thanks for your help,

"Hi guys, this is my first post on here. 24 year old healthy male.
About 3 years ago I had a seemingly non-serious slip in some mud, and fell to the ground on my right inner knee. I bounced back up and was walking fine, never feeling anything was dislocated or unstable. I iced immediately after getting home and was very cautious with the knee in the weeks following the slip. A few weeks after that, a constant, dull sensation started to occur in my outer knee, just above and to the right of my right kneecap. A few months after the injury, I went on a month-long trip to Europe and walked around 20 000 steps every day, but the soreness did not increase or decrease, it would simply sometimes feel more tired than other times at random. A month or two after that, I went to physio for the first time to discover my right leg had much less flexibility when bending. That physiotherapist helped get the flexibility back to normal, but the soreness remained. That sensation has continued to this day, sometimes increasing in sensation, sometimes lessening in sensation. But overall, it is a constant feeling of discomfort and the general feeling of the leg being heavy and tiring quickly.
I have gotten an ultrasound, MRI, X-ray, all of which gave me results saying my knee is in perfect condition. I've been to 3 different physiotherapists and consulted with 2 different orthopedic surgeons, and none of them can seem to find the real reason behind this constant dull soreness. The pain does not seem to be related to how much force is applied to it, because I can run on the treadmill of a half an hour and feel fine, but sometimes simply walking for an hour or two will tire it out very quickly. Even when I jump up and down onstage pain is not triggered (though there is some minor swelling afterward). A few weeks ago I got a steroid injection, which slightly reduced the soreness for a while, but I feel the leg going back to its usual state already. Recently, through self-massaging, I realized that when I press certain areas on my inner right knee, specifically where the two large bones connect, a jarring sensation (not pain, but a very sudden, intense sensation) will trigger on the opposite side of my knee, where the bones meet on the outer side.
I am writing to this forum because I simply have no idea what else to try. I have done every quad-strengthening, glute-strengthening exercise etc in the book and nothing seems to change the sensation. If anyone has any suggestions or information at all, I would be very appreciative.

"For the **1st time in 4 visits he actually touched my knee. He knew just where to touch it to make it hurt. Everywhere.I explained it was actually getting worse the last 2 weeks. The tourniquet feeling was is almost nonstop. Chico suggested I ask for an Alignment Check. An X-RAy from hip to ankle to see if There is slippage or visible problems with the replacement knee. He dismissed it as not being an important revealing X Ray and suggested I stop following this forum that no one knows what they are talking about. Then he said he would take the x rayplus a knee x ray too. So after the X ray he shows me the X Ray. The line drawn from hip to ankle was almost straight in the middle. But then he tells me my left TNR leg is shorter than the right. Funny as my right leg has been shorter. My pelvis dips on one side. So this was an unnecessary Alignment check but look how much he found it. He said something about my knee cap tracking,up and down. it was off to one side or slipping?
When I asked him about several exercises I do, he said to stop them all. Except the Nu Step.
I was doing **all **the wrong exercises. They were o.k. for the first 3 months not going into month 6. He said I need SLR, hip abductor strengthening , and hamstring stretching.He showed me 3 exercises and said if I did them 3 times a day for a month I would notice a big difference. Of course no pictures, I trued to write them down. PLUS he wrote a script for PT. IF the Insurance company would pay for it. I called Pt and they have to get a pre determination and I wouldn't know before. next Wednesday because of the Holiday. Have to buy a straight backed office chair to do exercises in.
So I was surprised he didn't just dismiss me, or refuse to do the xrays. I feel more hopeful and relieved there was no scaring. The fluid and inflammation he claimed he couldn't do anything about. I got a script for Mobic.
So we will see. Thanks everyone for your support and input. I really appreciate it!!!

"Hello, I've been reading ""old"" comments from patients who have had PKR, and it sounds as if there are lots of problems during recovery. I've had knee pain for several years, managing with injections, Advil, and physical therapy. My MRI shows torn meniscus and moderate arthritis, especially in the medial area. Doctor recommends PKR in the medial area, says recovery is much easier than TKR, there's a 95% success rate, and I should do it sooner rather than later. I am 76, healthy, physically active mostly walking. Right now I can manage the pain and continue to walk, but wonder if I should follow doctor's recommendation. I would appreciate any comments. Thank you.

"Basically ive had this injury for about 8 years. i am a very active person who does martial arts, gymnastics, parkour, rock climbing and dance. however it is only painful after intense stretching, high impact exercises, low squatting. the pain usually occurs the next day and gradually builds up until i can no longer extend to full lock as is to painful. usually after two weeks the pain goes away but if do the specific exercises i listed it will cause another painful episode. the pain is sudden and does not last but occurs everytime i extend my knee from bent to full lock and almost clicks into place when ar full lock. the pain is on the click. i have attached a video as the click is visible on the outside. basically i have no clue what it is and have gone to the nhs whereby they just gave me stretches and i have gone to osteopaths but no one has actually told me what is wrong. im debating on going back to the nhs for scans but not sure i should. any help would be much appreciated. thanks

"Had R TKR last Aug. No issues been fab. Noticed now weather warmer thinking of wearing culottes that I seem to have raised veins on outer aspect of knee about 3 inches from scar. They look whitish. Just wondered if anyone else had this. My knee is throbbing but am more active. Still can't bear kneeling on it though. It's not painful as such just feels weird and unpleasant.

"Hello,
Has anyone else suffered from this crippling syndrome? It comes on without warning a liquid flushing feeling in your knee and all of a sudden you cant bend your knee and then the excruciating debilitating pain hits. when this happens to me I am down for the count for the better part of the day. I have had my knee revised two years ago but it came back almost to the date of my revision surgery. I had an angiogram which did not turn up the bleed. I am now 3 weeks post 2nd revision surgery and am hoping to put this all behind me. Please let me know if any of you post TKR have run into this situation.
Thanks.

"Hey my fellow new knee family. Its day 3 post-op surgery. Had first PT session today, traded pain for gain. A few things that are working for me are: using Tylenol 650mg rather than opioid meds for pain. My believe is opioid meds while briefly easing pain, spread poison though out the body. Check the multitude of opioid side effects. I rather deal with higher pain for a short period, rather than long term issues from opioids. Eating extra fruits and vegetables along with drinking lots of water and a daily protein shake. Anyway, I am proceeding on my journey to pain free living. Bests regards and the Lord's blessings to my family. RJ

5 1/2 months PKR and I've been doing some gardening, mostly sitting on a tall upturned bucket - knee is a bit painful on the outside (PKR was inside) and my ankle has swollen. Is this to be expected?

"I injured my right knee playing football in 1966, and again in1967, had the cartilages removed in 1967, still continued to play football, and had more surgery in 1984, put off having a TKR until November 2018, and now 6 months later am not sure if it was a good move, as I still cannot bend it past the 90degrees, so have problems going down stairs, and walking down a steep hill, and riding a bike, and doing those exercises which require knee flexion. I do all exercises that the PT/Physio advises, swim every day, go to the Gym everyday, have a walk and do stairs every day, but the knee just wont bend, it is so frustrating, and that's not including the pain and suffering, the sleepless nights, of those early few weeks, and reading a few blogs from fellow TKR sufferers feel that Surgeons that do these operations over estimate their success rate

"Hello,
So 4 days ago I was doing some exercises. My knee was hurting a bit when I was doing some of the exercises, but I was thinking that it`s probably because I am out of shape. While I was doing some squads at one point my knee popped, but there wasn't any pain.I didn't feel any pain or weakness for a really long time. Maybe 6 hours later I started feeling weakness in the knee. It wasn't that bad, but with time It got worse. If I rest and don't do anything It gets better. For example, after I wake up it's much better. But if during the day I try to walk around my apartment I quickly get tired just by a couple of steps.Except for this small walks, I only rest in my bed. There is no bruising or swelling, or anything visual on my knee.Except for the weakness, I don't really feel much pain. It's more like stiffness and discomfort and if there is pain it's nothing serious. When my leg is laid flat sometimes I feel something like pulling in the back of my knee, on the inner side of my leg. Also yesterday I had to climb a small step and I felt a strange feeling at the same place. I am not sure how to describe it. It was something like a thinglig sensation.
Currently, I am in a foreign country and I am going home after a month. It wiloild be hard for me to see a doctor here, and since I don`t have any swelling or bruising I was thinking that it might not be necessary.
Should I see a doctor? What Is wrong with my knee? Is there anything I can do to get better?

"in 2012, I had both knees replaced. About five years afterward I started having severe pain in my lower calf upon weight-bearing. Shortly after that I was told I needed a repair because my prosthesis had come loose. I am now one year out from the repair surgery and the calf pain has gotten unbearable. Any weight-bearing such as walking or standing more than about 5-10 minutes starts the pain that is only alleviated by getting off my feet. My chiropractor, who has never steered me wrong in any medical issue, is 99.9% convinced that what I’m experiencing is stem tip pain; however, when I checked with my surgeon, he does not agree and is sending me for a second opinion from an ankle and foot doctor. I did some research and saw where about 20% of the people who have TKR experience stem tip pain. The articles were all medical and so they were very hard to understand. nowhere did I read that they have come up with any solution to this pain. Has anyone else been experiencing this pain? And if so, have you come up with any solution for it. Would appreciate any help in this matter, as I have become very inactive because of this great pain.

"Education.......I had physical therapy on Friday, May 24. The physical therapist was aggressive with me as I had difficulty straightening my right knee. Before starting pt, i was experiencing knee stiffness. She used some knee strengthening exercises on me and told me if I didn't learn how to walk correctly, I would fall and end up in a nursing home and remain there for rest of life. So I worked hard to exercise. When I got home, I experienced a lot of pain in my lower back and right knee. Since Friday, I have been using cold and heat paks on my knee and taking Naprosyn 500mg to relieve the pain and inflammation. I need to inform my physical therapist as to what happened when returning home. I had more pain after pt and no pain when starting. I am 73 years old and also have rheumatoid arthritis. The knee is osteoarthritis and possibly the meniscus tear irritated. I plan on letting the Physical Therapist know what happened so that we can adjust the exercises or try some massage when the knee is in a flare. Any feedback on how to handle things with the PT. I don't want to feel like I'm blaming her. On the other hand it's an inform and go easy next time maybe

"I can't believe 5 months have passed since my TKR. I am STILL having numbness on the left side of my knee. Also swelling, a feeling of having a tourniquet on my knee. The skin is so tight it feels like it is tearing. Some times I get electrical shocks in my knee. I want some answers this time. Have only seen him a few times since the surgery. ""This is normal, everyone heals differently, yadda yadda yadda."" It is not normal....... The constant pain and tourniquet pain is WORSE with each day. I have no pain meds, he won't prescribe any. I can hardly think sraight as the pain is CONSTANT. I am doing the home exercises, icing and even that doesn't help. Getting in the tub is like lifting concrete, going down stairs is hard, coming up easier, I can't bend over to work in the yard. Walking more than an hour is a killer.
I see the surgeon Thursday , what kind of questions can I ask him? Could it be scar tissue, Bursitis, something torn or something else? I need him to REALLY listen to me. And I WILL make him touch my knee. He never has. I have got to get something to make the tourniquet feeling get better or go away. Any advise GREATLY appreciated.

A few years ago, my left knee started clicking and grinding every time I bend it or go up the stairs. There is also some slight knee pain as well all around the knee. This happens every day and exercises to relieve the pain, however, some exercises make it worse. The injury was not caused by any injury, however, it may have been overused in the gym. I haven't had any other problems with it other than the pain and clicking/grinding. Does anyone know what I might have when there was no injury involved?

"Here I am back again to check with those of you who are sharing the journey of total knee replacement. This week marks three months since my surgery. Progress was very slow in the beginning, but I do have less pain and much more range of motion now. My extension is at 5, and doesn't budge, even with Chico's excellent exercise and therapy twice a week. My biggest concern and what seems to have my progress at a standstill is the swelling of my knee any time I am on it for more than an hour. It also remains swollen overnight. Worse is the feeling of a tight band around the whole knee that accompanies the swelling, and aches constantly. Is this something that is common at this stage in recovery? I am concerned that there might be something else going on? I would greatly appreciate your experience. I see my surgeon again in 3 weeks, and my physical therapists just say it will take time to resolve. Thank you ! ***

"It seems an appropriate time, four days after a full revision to take a look at the 'hurt scale'.
One unit shall be known as a Hurtz..... Any feedback most welcome.
22 months after my first (there wont be a second) TKR I went in last Friday for the procedure.
A 'revision' for those who may not know, is starting again. All the bits that went in the first time are consigned to a bucket using an array of drills and hammers, (as its not supposed to come out) and new stuff inserted deeper into the bones to get some purchase !
Ouch indeed....
I thought (and Im sure Im not alone) that pre-tkr, I had reached 10 out of 10 on the hurt scale. Indeed I had that very conversation with the surgeon and as a result went ahead with the procedure. People told me (even some I trusted) that there was pain beyond 10 Hurtz, but as Id already peaked at 10 (for some years), I wasnt able to comprehend such numbers, so dismissed them as fiction. The ramblings of fools and scaremongers!
I then had the TKR and realised there were a further 10 levels of hurt (at least) available to me that I hadnt before considered possible.
My first of 2 MUA's got me to around a mind-blowing 25 Hurtz on the recovery table (where I was quickly re-sedated to shut me up) and Im pretty sure Im back in the mid to late 20's after attempting a leg lift earlier, rolled towel under knee or not... Crikey it Hurtz..
Discuss...
Having said that, its not too bad when resting. Much better than the first time despite the beating my leg has been through, so Im hopeful for a far better outcome. I slept last night pretty well, again better than last time. I dont have a dark blue upper leg and buttock as I did last time and no sign of the bruise around my thigh from the agricultural strapping. All in all, and I realise its very, very early days, Im reasonably (all things considered) happy. I just wish it didnt hurt so much. Im already at two and a half times (25 Hurtz) the pain that I was able imagine just 22 months ago and Im not sure its over just yet. Given the size of the pharms industry youd think this pain could be better managed... Poor show Pharms

"I have been reading some of the post regarding knee replacement and it does seem that some are suffering tightness and pain in legs after surgery. I am at week 22 after bilateral knee replacement and the pain is unbearable at times, which leads me to be depressed at times, and upset with my surgeon who did not indicate that this was a possibility. I have my daughters wedding in 5 weeks and the only thing that I was told by the surgeons staff was that since my surgery was six months before the wedding that I would be in great shape and dancing at the wedding. I will be lucky if I can stand long enough to have photo's done, and definitely will not be dancing. Sitting, sleeping, standing, pretty much everything, causes pain.
I am doing physiotherapy still, twice a week as well as at home, massage once to twice a week, saw a chiropractor for several weeks, doing all my exercises, going in a pool, using a hot tub , everything that is recommended to me. Still no relief and constant pain.
I am looking for anyone that found something that worked for them. Does anyone have a success story that can give me some direction to help alleviate the pain. My neighbour had bilateral knee replacement and he said that it took two years for the pain and tightness to go away, but I think by then, I may lose my mind. As much as I try not to, this consumes me every day.
Any words of wisdom from anyone who has or is dealing with this.
Very disappointed that surgeons are not more forthcoming with the after effects. When I was in rehab after surgery for 12 day, they nicknamed me SuperStar because I was progressing so well. Then this set in and is taking the best of me.

"Hi all, I had my first tkr on Nov. 13,2017. The year after the surgery was awful. Pain, swelling, and clicking. My surgeon wouldn't take my concerns seriously. Ten months after surgery he recommended I see another surgeon in the practice that deals with tkr replacements. This surgeon tested my knee for infection and did extensive blood work. I also had a bone scan, and ultrasound. The new surgeon recommended tkr revision surgery. On December 15, 2018 I had the surgery. After that I went to out patient therapy, three times a week for 5 weeks. I couldn't bend my knee past 90° or straighten it completely after my therapy. My surgeon preformed MUA (movement under anesthesia) and suggest more therapy. I still couldn't bend it unless I dug my fingers into the back of my knee. I tried to go back to see my surgeon, only to find out he had left the practice. So on to surgeon number three. This surgeon said my Poptelis muscle is caught on a piece of the knee equipment. Now I'm awaiting a procedure to fix that. It's been over two years dealing with this and I'm getting so tired of not being able to function. It helps to just write it all out and get it out....

"Hi all.
Patella dislocation 5 weeks ago for first time in 15 years. Was in a splint for a week then have been wearing a hinged knee brace and walking with one crutch. Still waiting for physio referral but have been trying my best to still exercise the knee and keep as mobile as possible.
When I do not have the brace on if I try to walk I can feel the kneecap sliding out of place again.
Up until now the pain has not been unbearable but I have needed to take the co codamol prescribed by my GP. However, today the pain is actually awful, whole knee is swollen and a lot of pain on the inside and outside of the kneecap.
At the moment I have resorted back to ice and elevation, I'm not sure what else to do.
Does anyone have any suggestions?
I am pretty sure I will end up back with the orthopaedic team but just running out of ideas of what to do.

"I know this is not the right forum for this, but I just couldn't find the right one. Anyways, my tibia isn't fully healed yet, I have about a month to go but my ortho has put me in a walking boot. He advised that I only put 50% weight on it for the time being. My question, should I wear my boot while sleeping? I've read different responses on this issue. My ortho said he didn't think I needed to, but I was looking to see if anyone thinks differently. Like is he wrong?

"Hi peeps. I joined this forum because i am so sick of googling for answers and am at rock bottom with my disabling knee pain.....
46 years young. female. first time mum at 45 via IVF. Today is my first mothers day- one that should be filled with joy. once again my knee has spoiled the fun and am feeling very sorry for myself- too scared to get out of chair and take a step because the pain is like an electric shock through my knee cap at the slightest movement. I walk with a straight leg because if i relax and try to walk normally- the sharp pain stops me in my tracks and takes my breath away. i cannot mask it from family and friends and it is extremely frightening and embarrassing. Dreading going out for dinner now as i can't fake walking like a normal person and i have been looking forward to it all week. hate people feeling sorry for me but i can't seem to fix my rotten left knee!
I am 7 weeks post first arthroscope on left knee. Also finished 3 PRP injections 2 weeks apart. i have grade 4 chondromalacia. knee cap worn out in 2 out of 3 places so total knee replacement is the next step.
Was really hopeful that surgery had helped. Seems like i was starting to get more mobility. cycling 5 minutes a day- carrying my 12kg 10month old baby up and down stairs at home 4 days a week. slowly trying to walk more than 10mins at a time with pram then bang! the sharp pain is back 5 weeks post surgery-3days doing nothing to recover. slowly start to come good again then 2 weeks later i'm screwed again.
My right knee has grade 3 chondromalacia and has given me grief also except 1 durolane injection really helped it.
The big issue for me is the type of pain difference in both knees.....
Has anyone experienced this horrendously sharp pain on minimal weight bearing? imy surgeon brushes of this sharp pain as synovitis but it's just so debilitating!!!! i keep hoping that it's nerve or spine related as i have a degenerate lower spine and mild hip dysplasia. i have slightly knock knees and both hips scoped. first one was left hip at 39 years old then right hip at 41. left hip was much worse than right hip and knees are behaving the same way.
i am considering stem cell to help grow cartilage but it's not cheap. i could put off a total knee replacement if only i could get rid of the SHARP pain on movement.
if anyone has had similar type of pain and any recommendations -I would be most grateful as i am desperate and very depressed thus.
thanks in advance.

Have a 120: flex and leg is completely straight. I also had a prepatella bursa removed from other knee during the op so am finding that knee to be quite stiff.

"Hi I am 9 weeks post op second tkr and was anxious to get back to some excercise regime after 5 years of cancer and treatment and 2 tkr the first being March 18 the second March 19. I had an opportunity to go to a yoga class but getting up and down on the floor was a problem and I used a chair for support. The poses on knees were far too painful. Some of the standing poses were achievable but I could only access 50% of the class. I think I was expecting too much of myself!
Do you think I should abandon this for a while and continue walking and resume swimming? I resumed swimming about 10 weeks post op last time?

This symptom is very random and happens whenever my knees feel like being warm. This is very strange to me due to the fact that it is only my kneecaps that are so different in temperature compared to the rest of the body. Sometimes but very rarely it can be the other way around. So that my Kneecaps are very cold compared to the rest of my body. I would love some input on this matter.

"Hello, would like to find out if anyone has had to have revision total knee replacement surgery, and if so, what was the reason and how was the recovery as compared to the original surgery? I had my left knee replaced in July, of 2018. About two months after the surgery my knee started feeling unstable and there was a new type of pain that bothered me mostly at night in bed. My Surgeon told me that my PCL failed. It was either torn severely or it detached from the bone. Anyway, it will never heal and will only get worse so I need a posterior stabilized implant now. I will be having the revision surgery on June 20, 2019. STAY TUNED!

"Backstory: im a female, 24 yrs old. 5'7"" 136 lbs. Almost a year ago I started running. Anywhere between 1-3 miles 2-4 times per week. this lasted about 3 months. i stopped for one week to take a break and immediately knew something was wrong with my knee. i have constant twinges of pain in the bursa on the inside of my knee that attaches to my lower leg and internal knee pain that i cant pinpoint that happens after ive been walking or standing too long. after many doctors visits, physical therapy, and an mri, they have told me that nothing looks to be wrong with my actual knee(based off the MRI) and that i have bursitis. however- my knee crunches really really loud and this causes terrible pain afterwards. it never used to do this. I also have episodes where my knee pain is so bad i cant walk and its not pain coming from the bursa- its coming from inside the knee itself. my physical therapist told me that my entire knee including the bursa is swollen which leads him to think that theres actually something wrong with my knee. in physical therapy we have been working on strengthening my legs which are already pretty good and my hips and posture which have needed some work but so far nothing is helping. any ideas or advice on what could be going wrong? i feel like ive hit a wall.

"Hi all, I'm wondering about other people's experience of walking after a tkr. I'm 16 weeks post op . I love to walk and managed to keep it going with meds right up until the operation. After the operation I started doing over 10, 000 steps after around 6 weeks. At first I got on OK but found after while I was getting worse rather than better so I cut it right down. Now I'm back to doing over 10,000 steps most days and managing OK but I find if I don't walk much for a couple of days my swelling seems to come down but if I walk a few miles it doesn't. So what are other people's experiences? Should I not do long walks at all yet or limit it to a few days a week?

"Hello
Please can anyone help/advise?
Around 8 months ago, I had knee surgery for a macerated lateral meniscus. After the surgery my knee was swollen and painful, the pain has since gone. however the swelling is still all around my knee and I have no power in my quad muscles. I can walk but squatting is impossible. I have spent the last 4 months trying to build up strength but there is no signal going to the muscles. 
I have had it drained but the fluid came back. There is no signs of gout. After multiple MRI's and talks with the surgeon, he has basically said thats just the way it is and there is nothing they can do. I can't believe this is the only solution. there has to be a way that I can get my strength back to my leg. I have two little children who miss me playing football and cycling. I am slowly getting depressed and my health is suffering.
Any advice or help would be very welcome. 
Thank you, Bryn

"Hi all, I have suddenly developed pain in my knees a year ago.
age 38 weight 58kg
used to be very strong and active.
conclusions :
private mri - chondropatio stage 1 -2
nhs- patellofemoral pain syndrome after reading the very same MRI
later nhs - unexplayned bilateral knee pain
after a year new mri - chondromalacia no stage given
private arthroscopy- st.3 chodropatio
This has caused me a lot of mental pain , but also caused me more damage to my cartilage than I had in the beginning.

Anyway i found out in January this year that the implant is loose when i had a bone scan, even though my inflammatory markers have come back normal and fluid aspirated from my knee was negative my consultant is convinced that its due to infection but an anaerobic one. this wednesday im having the implant removed and vancomycin beads put in along with a plastic joint as a temporary measure. The pain ive been experiencing at the top of my shin has been unbearable on weight bearing even after taking strong pain killers. i can honestly say that i am petrified that it isnt going to work and my life will be changed for ever. trying to stay positive but its difficult .

"In July 2017 I had an ACL repair along with partial meniscectomy. My recovery went well with regular doctor check ups and physical therapy. Over the last 7 months I've had something occur a few times and I'm wondering if anyone else has had something similar. I workout 4 times a week, I'm careful and have not had any workout related pain afterwards. But randomly I'll have moments where my knee just swells up and feels like I've somehow hurt it. It'll happen randomly, once it was when I went to sit down, most recently it was after walking down a hill. It almost seems like I've ""stepped wrong"" and it puts me out of commission for about a week while the swelling comes down and my knee feels normal again. During that week my knee will feel weak and daily things like stair climbing, will be a little difficult. I'm wondering if this is something that I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life or am I still technically in a recovery phase that can take years. Has anyone else dealt with something like this?

"I have had a long history of patella dislocation, first started when I was 11 (now 34) Both knees would go for seemingly no reason, never any trauma to cause it they would just pop out and then in again.
Left knee seemed to calm down and respond to physio but right knee wouldn't cooperate and I ended up having TTT, MPFL reconstruction, Lateral release and 3 Arthroscopy (last one was 10 years ago). So far other than just the usual pain you get from arthritic knees I've only had the odd occasion where they have felt a bit wobbly.
I go to the gym regularly using bikes, cross trainers and treadmills without any problems and i spend a lot of time on my feet for my job and looking after my 4 year old daughter.
On Monday as I went to sit down in a chair my left kneecap dislocated. It went straight back in and x ray showed bones all ok, am in cricket pad splint and on crutches with a referral for physio.
I am concerned at what this could mean for me long term, with my history is the physio likely to just send me back to orthopaedics?
Does anyone else have experience with this sort of thing where it has been such a long time between dislocations?
Any advice is very much appreciated.

"Hi,
I'm suspecting that I may have a Meniscus injury. My doctor checked my knee and told me there was some looseness in the ligament. Could this looseness be due to a meniscus tear?
My injury happened as I was kneeling down with my feet flat on the ground and I lifted my body with heavy dumbbells in my hands and I heard a pop and the quad muscle went stiff. There was no swelling and I can bend my knee without any problems other than my knee clicking twice each time I bend it. The pain that I have had has never been severe, but just annoying and it occurs all around the knee, but not where the meniscus is. When I stop doing my knee exercises, the pain gets worse and so does the clicking knee. My symptoms sound like my patella is not tracking properly, so I wanted to know whether I may have patella maltracking due to the meniscus tear? I've done some knee exercises for 6 months, but the clicking never went away.
The injury happened about 5 years ago and I have an MRI scan next week.

"Hi, I had TKR just over 3 months ago for a Valgus knee. For the first few weeks my knee/leg felt straight, but then I did an exercise that caused a lot of pain and after that I struggled to get from sitting to standing or do anything that put weight on a bent leg. That gradually improved as time went on, but I began to feel my knee was shifting inwards when going up stairs. The PT I saw wasn't bothered by it and signed me off a couple of weeks ago. My local area offers 12 weeks 1:1 at our local gym to help people increase their activity following surgery and they watched me walk and commented that my knee was shifting inwards as I walked. Does anyone know if there's anything I can do to stop this happening and whether valgus knees are more prone to problems following surgery ? I'm concerned that this is going to affect my recovery as I've noticed other people with valgus knees seem to end up with revisions not long after the original surgery and I still need the other knee doing.

my question is is this since his tkr his legs and feet are now straight
could this be the reason that his shoes are not fitting or could it be because of his age and he's walking differently?

"Hi, hope you have a few minutes, this is pretty long winded ! I had my right TKR Jan. 18 & now I'm pain free in the knee, & awaiting my left to be done, however, some few mths after, I developed a stoop & back ache, which ive never suffered from before. ( I'm 64 by the way ) I limped before my op & I'm still limping. My new knee leg is longer, due, I'm assuming, to a mis-alignment of my hips, but because of this i tend to have my right leg bent a lot of the time, especially when standing still. I can straighten my right leg, but feel some pain down my inner thigh & wondering if I've shortened that muscle from always having it bent. Is this possible even ? The stoop is concerning me, as if I try to straighten up, it really hurts. Is it my spine ? my hip ? or muscles ? Will it balance things out when I get the other knee done ? Sorry this is so long, but its quite hard to explain all thats going on ! Thanks for reading this, hope someone might be able to advise me. x

"Last August 2018..and Partial Knee replacement Surgery...and a plastic knee cap..all due to sport..
Plates inserted into cement etc..and all seemed well
Specialists wanted to maintain my level of sport, hence the partial Unicompartmental operation..and not full knee replacement am i am 60 years old hoping to return to county level squash..a dream perhaps
Have been doing really well since the operation....i
With physiotherapy etc..have increased my levels of exercise , with longer distances of walking at increased pace...and even started gym work...with the odd pain and discomfort at times..but all manageable with ice, pain killers and rest and elevation...
Although the knee is not fully bending yet..after 7 months..but hope that will change..
Then last week..after an hours walk...knee swelled up terribly...and became very soft as if it was filled with liquid and very painful to even touch...Then excruciating pain on the inside of the knee..probably called the medial collateral ligament..hardly able to move the knee sideways and very painful when i try to bend it..as it seems to be rather thick around the knee area..
i am icing it..resting it..elevating it and have at times returned to morphine to stop the pain...and have had to stop all exercises...
Any thoughts and suggestions out there...haven't been to my GP yet?

"Just had my 1 year checkup after having a total knee replacement. Doc says the x-ray looks great & I am gaining strength in my quad muscle. SO grateful for this site! Came to it in excruciating pain & unable to take narcotics due to vomiting. Also could not sleep; had sciatica, was on my own after 7 days; & was discouraged! Everyone here helped me so much. THE YEAR TIME LINE GIVEN BY CHICO WAS RIGHT ON FOR ME! IT helped me not get discouraged. i now do water aerobics 4 days a week and bike. Need to have the other knee done....but i am going to give myself some time as the ""nightmares"" of the 1st one have not totally gone!
THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE! IT DOES GET BETTER!!

"I just returned from an appointment with my surgeon and my knee cap is on the side of my knee. He had problems with the knee cap during surgery but said he had centered it. I have not been able to lift the leg and have difficulty getting out of chairs. I have been going to the gym 3 times a week and doing daily quad exercises. I have to get a brace to stabilize the patella and wear it for 3 months and if this doesn't work ...more surgery. Any one else with the same experience?

"Help! Today I fell while I was in my room. My crutch must have slipped or something next thing I know I'm on the floor. I don't think I hit my cast but now I keep getting sharp shooting pains in my knee area. I just recently got my cast changed to where I can bend my knees now, but after falling it hurts too much to bend my knee. I also fee l pain when just sitting around. Should I worry? Or should I wait a couple days then get an xray if the pain doesn't go away? I have about 6 weeks left before the cast is suppose to come off.

Both knees still clunck but the bad knee clunks and is extremely tight and feels like a wire is wrapped around it and has lost rom. My surgeon says it is called a PATELLA CLUNK which is caused by scar tissue. He will be removing the scar tissue in two weeks. Has anyone had success with scar tissue removal. I have always heard it just grows back. Also he said infection is a fear in removing scar tissue. Just looking for advice. THANKS!

"Hi All,
I had TKR in February 2017 I developed a blood clot in my calf three days after my op. Once I got over that things seemed to be going well until six months when I started to get really bad pain in my knee. This has continued to get worse. I have had all sorts of scans and ex-rays but nothing conclusive has been found. On my last visit to my consultant I found out that they did not replace or do anything with my knee cap. This where most of pain is, some days it is like when you fall over and graze your knee. It is like a burning sensation with pain also. It is my belief that the cartilage and bone of my knee cap is now rubbing on metal and plastic thus causing the severe pain particularly when I go up and down stairs. Has anyone else got this problem and is it in fact due to nothing being done with the knee cap?

"I just found this forum. Three more days and it will be three weeks since my BILATERAL knee replacement. So many challenges. Blood loss, four transfusions, short rehab (had to get out and get home) 76 years old and on home PT and nursing now. I am ready for a crying jag now. I have depression/anxiety with bipolar elements...all my life, so maybe that is helping me recognize that this round has a basis in the obvious. Never lost my appetite before but in rehab, it went out the window. I ate to eat to heal. Still doing that. Put on 20 pounds of edema with both legs done at once. Last night was second night without wearing the heavy immobilizers and my first good night of sleep. I am taking 1 to 2 tramadol a day. Last night though I slept finally about 10 hours with four trips to commode. I knew this would be tough but couldn't face the idea of doing it twice in a row. Now it's done. I have a significant other who is ""here"" for me, a great psychiatrist and therapist and I try to reach out...I am taking one day at a time, but evenings are very tough. Hope I sleep again tonight.

"Hi everyone!
i was so happy to find this discussion group! I am 3 weeks post op after a total knee replacement on my right knee. The depression has finally hit me. Never feeling pain free, not sleeping well at night, being dependent on someone else to get me to PT or grocery shop has really gotten me down. I'm not one to cry, but today the tears came pretty easy. I too have the burning that everyone here talks about. My physical therapist said that's the nerves that are healing. After doing my exercises I find it easier to walk with less of a limp, however it doesn't take long and my knee stiffens right up again. The hospital sent me home with this great ice machine so I'm not having to use ice packs like others have talked about. I just put 4 bottles of frozen water in this machine and then fill it with water up to the water line. Put the top back on and plug it in. It has tubing that runs from the machine to the pad that you strap to your leg with attached Velcro. The pad is shaped to form to your thigh right above the knee and the start of the calf right below the knee. This machine has been a blessing! Once the bottles thaw out, I exchange them with 4 frozen bottles from the freezer so I'm never without ice. The machine circulates that cold water constantly so you have and even amount going to your whole surgical area. Icing is great but sometimes I feel stiffer than if I don't use it at all. I'm taking Percocet for the pain and it helps to some degree but doesn't take all the pain away. I can't take codine, Vicodin or morphine because they make me so sick. But I'm wondering how all of you are dealing with the depression that comes along with all the pain? I'm a very independent person and not having any family that live close by makes me rely on one other person to run errands or take me to PT. I'm so tired of always sitting with my legs up or sleeping with a pillow between my knees so I can lay on my side at night. The lack of sleeping for more than an hour at night before the pain wakes me up and I get myself in another position to sleep is wearing on me. Can someone more than 3 weeks out of post op show me that there is light at the end of the tunnel?? So many people that I've talked to that had this done years ago say it's the best thing they've ever done. I'm certainly not feeling that way right now. If you asked me today if I'd do this again my answer would be absolutely not!!! But I'm sure weeks from now I'll feel totally different. Someone please tell me that I won't always regret doing this. I knew it was going to be a tough recovery, but I didn't realize that 3 weeks after surgery I'd still be feeling like this. I know I'm improving because I see the changes when I'm doing my exercises at home. Something that was so difficult a week and a half ago is much easier to do now. I guess I just want someone who's surgery is maybe 6 weeks out to say ""it does get better, this is how it is fir me now"". Something, anything positive. I'm happy I found this site and I pray I get a response to my posting. Good luck to all of you! I know we'll all make it through this tough process.

"I had a TKR in November 2018 and had to have a manipulation under anaesthetic in February 2019. My knee is a lot better - I can now bend it and I know it will weight bear because my physio has me doing exercises standing on my operated leg.
My problem is with stairs. I am just about managing to get up the stairs one foot after the other - something I haven't been able to do for years due to the pain. But it's so hard, and my knee aches so much afterwards I get so disheartened.
Coming down is a different matter. I use a step at physio and I'm now able to go straight on and off the other side in a totally natural movement, bending my operated knee. But the stairs are so much deeper than the step, and I just can't bend my knee enough to make it down the stairs - even using a crutch and the handrail, and doing it slowly so I don't fall (which is what scares me).
I'm still in a fair amount of discomfort most of the time, and have stopped taking pain meds as they made me feel nauseous.
Any one else had a similar problem? When you listen to stories of people having TKR, they are back to normal after just 6 weeks.

"I have learned so much from this group, the main thing being that i must be from outer space. I had my left TKR on 12 March 2019. The right was done on 16 October 2018. I had very minimal pain after the first one and was released from both my surgeon and PT at the 7 week appointments. Th e PT appointment was my first after surgery. I had even less pain with the left knee, and have already been released after my PT evaluation. The therapist said there was nothing he could do for me that I couldn't do at home. My ROM after 3 weeks was 120! I'm thinking the difference in recovery/pain level is that my surgeries were done in the US, and I received nerve blocks rather than spinals. Good Luck to all of you!

"Hello there, I know I am not going to say anything new on this board. I found it by chance a week or so ago and it has definitely been encouraging, however, having said that… LOL
I am six weeks out from TKR and definitely wishing I never did this. I absolutely have more pain now than I ever did prior to the surgery. I was getting injections for the pain and they did help, although I walked with a limp for the last three years after a failed meniscus surgery. Anyway, I guess I am fortunate because I stopped walking with a walker or cane within 10 days of surgery, I have been driving since three weeks out, and generally walking isn’t too bad. But don’t get me wrong, I am living with severe pain. I have been taking Percocet since surgery (but of course I do not take them if I know I’m going to be driving). keep thinking I’m going back to work (I'm A real estate broker so I can make my own hours ) but then morning comes and I just don’t feel up to it, between my knee and my head (emotions...)
My range of motion is OK, I guess, for my timeline. I am past 90° on the bend and have been from the beginning, but it changes daily. And I still cannot straighten my leg all the way. I am very swollen and stiff and have sharp pains on the sides of my knee, especially the outside. Sleeping is impossible with pain meds. . I feel like I am going to be one of those who doesn’t fully recover though, which I think is in my head because of the failed meniscus surgery.
The thought of having pain for months on end is really depressing. And let’s not even talk about how the lower back hurts from everything else going on. I'm 59 and was very active prior to my original knee injury 3 1/2 years ago but it just seems that life will never be the same. I’m dealing with all the depression everyone goes through too. I hate being such a whiner but I’m glad I have this board where at least someone can understand. if I had known what a long process this was, I don’t think I would have done it. As it was, right up into surgery I kept saying I didn’t want to do it. I am not normally a negative person but that sure brings the negative out in me . I guess right now I am just venting to cyberspace but it’s good to know there are people out there who understand this journey better than I do .

"People keep asking me when I am going to get new knees? I did homework and found out TKR is tricky. Worse recovery than hip or heart surgery. My doctor says I am too young, that I will have to have it done again in ten years. He also say when you can't sleep or it is painful all the time that is when to get it done. I woke up 8 years ago not having full ROM in both knees and my quads hurt. I assume I pulled something. My job requires heavy lifting, pushing and standing. Never had a problem with my knees. Anyhow, first step was cortisone shots. That moved pain to medial part of the knee. I never noticed any swelling, ever. Although lab work say I do. I have tried many thing and no change. Abstaining weeks away from certain foods and eating only certain foods, acupuncture, Rhus Tox, ice, heat, rest, yoga, DMSO, WD40, dandelions, onions, fish oil, Vitman D3, TENS unit... I even got fire ants to sting me 60 plus times on one knee. NO CHANGE, ZERO! I hobble around and make do. Wear Breg Freestyle braces and sit whenever possible. I sort of adapted. At rest I have no pain. Lifting and pushing are way less painful than running or standing. Honestly I am not totally convinced it is OA causing the problem. Reason being, I was rear ended about 4 years ago and as a preventive measure I got neck x rays. Doctor said I had spurs, OA that is was a mess. My neck feels fine and always has. They say the same about my knees. I did get checked for RA since my father was diagnose with it in the 70s. Test were not absolute so i was tested for Sclera Derma and Marfans. Those were not thrown out but was not likely I had those. time line of ailment are as follows. Woke up 10 years ago with lower back issues. Hurts when I bend over in one area. Then followed by Plantar faciatis and sciatica (1 time for about a month). Knees followed by feeling of being in a cloud, fog 5 years later. This led to getting my crystals checked (didn't know people had such), MRI of head, chest and torso. I do have a leaky heart valve, slightly enlarged lower ascending aorta and a meandering pancreatic duct. No real concern there other than keeping an eye on it. I mention these thing just in case there might be a connection to my knee pain. My plan is to put surgery off until i can walk at all. Am I a fool for not just biting the bullet and have surgery. Any input would be grateful. Thanks.

I have posted how discouraged I am with slow progress, severe swelling, and lots of pain five weeks out from surgery. I had PT 2 days ago, and therapist worked hard on extension and range of motion. It was painful, but we made progress. Even did well on exercise bike (first time) and another strengthening machine. Heat applied instead of ice at end of session. The next morning knee was even more swollen and painful than before therapy. A bit better today. Is this a normal result of therapy ? I am gaining extension and Range of motion, but pay dearly for it in the days following. I would appreciate input. I am working hard to hang in on the journey!

I kept putting my 2nd one off, saying, it's not as bad as my 1st knee. It was, I just wasn't looking forward to the recovery period. I decided on end of January/Feb so I could be off work during the winter. I know everyone's experiences are different but this time has been so easy. I've had no sticks since about week 4 and even then it was really for confidence I used them (only outside). I've been sleeping on my side or stomach since week 2-3. Since the moment my op was done and that arthritic pain had gone, I wished I hadn't waited so long.

"Looking forward to the final knee replacement in a good way. Now the real work begins. The prior surgery was thirty months ago and I kept notes from the rehab journey in anticipation of this upcoming procedure. My surgery planning or ""prehab"" is as follows: lose 5-10 pounds; daily squats both chair type and wall; stairmaster for 20 minutes every other day; weight exercises for both upper body and knees 3-4 times weekly; walk a mile daily with cane, as needed; and, proper nutrition (no salty, sweet snacks, or deserts; more fresh fruits and veggies); and sleep. I am hoping that putting in extra effort prior to surgery will result in a fast recovery and easy rehab. Best wishes and the Lord's blessing to all my fellow TKR graduates and pending graduates on your journey to pain free movement.

"Hi all, I am 26 (almost 27), white, male, and I have Cerebral Palsy (causes chronic muscle pain, weakness, and sometimes muscle spasms in my legs) *not wheelchair bound but I do walk with a bit of a limp. Back in 2016 I hurt my right knee getting out of the shower (I stepped over the side of the tub on the floor and felt a sharp pain shoot up to my knee). Doctor wanted me to physical therapy but insurance won't cover it and I can't afford it out of pocket so he gave a knee brace and exercises to do at home. They have not been helping so he gave a cortisone shot then after that he tried some gel I forget the name of and more substantial knee brace but still not much relief. Back in February we had an ice storm and I slipped and bashed my knee into the planter box in front of my house, this caused more pain and swelling to the point I can barely put weight on in or bend it too far so my doctor sent me to have an another MRI. My doctor sent me email with the MRI report and said he put in an order for me see an ortho doctor. Can someone ""un-doctor-ese"" this for me please?
Findings:
Scattered subcutaneous edema. Moderate sized joint effusion. Nonspecific glenohumeral capsulitis.
Lateral translation of the patella in relation to the femoral trochlea redemonstrated. Mild edema about the retinaculum without full-thickness tear. Progressive lateral patellofemoral chondral malacia compared to previous with areas of near full-thickness chondral loss in the lateral femoral trochlea and low-grade patchy subchondral edema. Inflammation redemonstrated in the suprapatellar fat pad.
Quadriceps and patellar tendons are intact.
6 mm filling defect along the posterior margin of the lateral femoral condyle with additional small filling defects questioned in the posterior aspect of the joint.
Femoral tibial joint spaces relatively well-maintained.
Cruciate ligaments are intact.
Collateral ligaments are intact. Popliteus tendon is intact.
No meniscal tear.
Impression:
Lateral translation of the patella redemonstrated with accelerated and progressive lateral patellofemoral chondromalacia with grade 4 changes now noted to the lateral femoral trochlea. Correlate for patellofemoral tracking abnormality.
Findings are suspicious for multiple posterior joint bodies which may represent chondral fragments from the patellofemoral joint.
Inflammation of the suprapatellar fat pad may indicate fat impingement.
Moderate joint effusion and nonspecific capsulitis.

Then there is the crying. I cry all the time, every day. I don't have a support system, live in a remote area and am alone 95 percent of the day. Someone please tell me this Will get better, that I am not losing my mind. I simply want my life back.

"Never, ever, find yourself comparing your experience to anyone else... we are all different, with different legs, knees and bodies.. ( wouldn't it be boring if we were all the same ) I had my second ( R ) TKR done in late November, 2018. Wow, what a different journey to the first ! ... I'm in TASMANIA , AUS.Its our first cold day today since my op, and I really feel like I want to scream with pain ... still on PALEXIA SR and IR and PANADOL, guided by my GP.
Have been going quite well with bending and walking etc. I did go to rehab after surgery, best thing. I also do Hydrotherapy twice a week. Cant afford to go to PT as often as I would like though.
How has everyone else been? AS

"I am 4 weeks, 5 days post op. TKR. But let me start by telling you what happened prior to this surgery. I had a replacement on the left 10 years ago. I went to my surgeon,, knowing it was time, my right leg was SO painful, with my leg bowing out. He did an x ray of both sides and said I had a fractured knee cap on the left. I don't care, the right one HURTS! well he sent me to his young associate, who said he was going to do a small revision and 6 weeks later I could have the right one done. I practically begged to have the right one done first. Ok, 2 surgeries, 4 hospital stays a tissue infection, sepsis and a pic line later I was able to start doing therapy for the left knee. By then my right one was so bad it was very limited what I could do. Dang, long story, huh? So 3 months later I got the right one done. I think I've done pretty well, stairs are still pretty scary. I know numbers are NOT important but I'm bending at 130° and 2° from straight. Still hurts, trying to stay away from the Oxy but haven't had a day that I didn't take at least one. My left knee bends well but I can't straighten it. It's like I have some muscle on the left side of my thigh, but the inside.. nothin! Well, good luck to you all I know it takes a year before you're 100%, lets take it slow.

"Thank you all for your encouragement, prayers and thoughts. I saw the surgeon for ROM check this past Thursday. He finally ok'd in home PT 3 times a week for 4 weeks and told me that I can go back to work. .I am work housekeeping at a very nice cabin rentals. He told me the walking would probably be good for me. Wonderful, when I have a nice Eliptical treadmill in my room. He could have told me that about 3 weeks ago. I have to have a doctors release statement to take to my work. When I leave that office I will also get a copy of my records. He's fired. He works for my insurance company and myself, not the other way around. I will also look for a counselor. My in home therapy begins this week and I've kept up on my daily exercises. Thank you all again and God bless. I will pop in time to time for an update. I hope you all know how helpful you have been. This is a wonderful board.

"Am now in week 7 after TKR in January and am desperate for a good night's sleep. I've not had much pain during the day, and stopped codeine after week 3, just using paracetamol when achy, so I realise I'm very lucky in that respect. However night time is really depressing. I go to bed at 10 every night but cant drop off to sleep until after 1 am, then I'm awake every 1.5 to 2 hours, having to get up and stretch my knee and rub ibuprofen gel on. Sometimes its another hour before I drop off again so I'm getting about 4 hours sleep before I get up in despair at 9 am. I saw my consultant 2 days ago and he says it's pretty normal to have disrupted sleep patterns, and he's given me another 2 weeks before I go back to work so I'm hoping things settle down before then. I've tried Nytol one a night, but it still doesn't help me to drop off, I've done deep breathing, listening to calming sounds, all the usual, to no effect. Before I had the op I could get off to sleep with no problem but then woke up every couple of hours with the pain from my knee, and I wonder if its just habit that's keeping me awake. Also, I'm not doing much during the day apart from my exercises, because the weather's not been good enough to get out for walking, so maybe I'm not tired enough? Has anyone else had these sleep problems and found a cure?

So far i am only taking one pain pill at night to help me sleep! My therapist says my attitude has a lot to do with my recovery. I did my exercises before the surgery and do them several times a day as required. I may be retired, i don't have a job to go back to, but i refuse to let this get me down. I am convinced that i have an unusually high tolerance for pain and for that i am grateful. My doctor asked if i was going to have another 7 week recovery and i said maybe 6 1/2!

"Hello, today is the 4th day since this has started.
On day 1, I woke up with the inability to straighten my leg. The pain felt both muscular and something else, possibly joint pain, whenever I would straighten my leg. This was odd because before sleep, my legs were completely fine.
On day 3, I started stretching my leg and that has helped a lot with pain from where my knee is. I can now walk with no pain. But my leg still cannot straighten.
When straightening my leg, I feel as if something is physically stopping it from completely straightening it.
I feel that this is serious and would like opinions or guidance on this.

"Hi all.
Currently, I'm a 21 yr old male and in May 2017 I had right knee surgery for a torn lateral meniscus and cyst removal. The tear was really bad; I had an enlarged meniscus and the tear was regular through that portion and then horizontal through the outer portion of my meniscus. Where it met the joint capsule, a cyst formed at the joint line just posterior to where the IT band comes down past the joint. The surgery removed the extra meniscus, ""repaired"" the torn portion using a blood clot thing they made, and the cyst was removed.
Fast forward past months of both physical rehab with a PT and personally, I was still struggling with the scar tissue left behind by the removed cyst and nobody could really give a straight answer as to how to deal with it and what not other than keep strengthening the joint and leg muscles. I returned to sports such as basketball and running on and off and although I was cautious with impact and such, I still experienced trouble with my joint strength and inflammation in the general area of my repaired meniscus and the scar tissue from the removed cyst. After almost 2 years of assuming that all my problems are just due to that scar tissue and the need for better rehab regiment, I fear that this may not be the actual problem. After doing a lot of research over time and obviously inspecting my own knee hundreds of times over the past year+, I am confident in saying that I think the bones in my knee are slightly misaligned. The area where the cyst was removed has felt very hard and has kinda stuck out a bit since the surgery. I was told its just dense scar tissue and it will mostly go down eventually. After almost 2 years I think that is wrong and that actually what I feel and see is the edge of the top of my tibia. I feel this is true because when I look at the medial side of the same knee, I see that my femur sticks out a tad bit more than the tibia does, in relation to the medial side of my healthy knee. I went to my doctor with this information(who by the way originally thought that the bump was my fibular head, haha lol) and after convincing her otherwise she said that it may be a good thing because it isn't too much of a difference and it reduces friction on my IT band. I understand this but I'm still worried because this misalignment is only true when my leg is straightened. As I bend my knee, I feel and see the joint line realign, but as I straighten it out and the knee is only like 10 degrees bent, I feel a small pop and see the edge of my tibia stick out just a few millimeters where that scar tissue is.
My other concern is that any actual scar tissue that is over there is somewhat wrapped around my LCL because I can't seem to feel out the whole ligament as thoroughly as I can with the LCL of my left knee when I'm sitting in the butterfly position. Additionally to all this, a recent MRI revealed I have a sprained ACL. My doctor only knows this from the radiology report but she did not review the actual MRI disc herself. She didn't exactly tell me what to do about that because we both understand that those can heal on their own but she wouldn't say that if it meant her losing out on another potential surgery to perform and get paid for. After about 3 months of straight rehab and no strenuous sports, my ACL has not healed. I know this because I feel the pain when I descend downstairs and put all my weight on my right leg as it bends and I step down with the other leg.
In short, I have a sprained ACL to an unknown degree, I fear the strength of my LCL is compromised due to scar tissue from the removed cyst(nothing about this on the MRI report), and I fear the slight misalignment of my knee when fully extended is a problem that may have resulted from the compromised LCL and may have contributed to the sprained ACL. What can anyone make of this and, what should I do?

"I was born with bad knees, runs in the family. Besides a few falls on my right knee and occasional knee pain randomly, not much pain. However, a couple days ago I began experiencing a pain in both knees around the kneecap (and to the sides). My legs feel weak and stiff when I bend them, and now they ache solely by elevation and straightening them out.
Last night, I heard a loud pop in my right knee as well as a rush of pain, leg trembling, and inability to stand or bend my knee (fold it in).
I don't want to rush to the ER or doctor if not necessary.
Today, currently, my knees both hurt in the same place and same way. A tight, gripping stiffness, with some burning sensation.
Also, I don't know if this is connected, but there's also a coldness and pain in my right foot, its been hurting alongside my right knee pain this whole time. (Also lots of crackling, popping and grinding feeling in knee, this is usual, but it seems worse)

"So I've not had problems with my legs before beyond getting orthotics. But I've noticed lately that my knees are quite weak and I get this odd popping sensation in the back of my leg when bending it for like a hamstring curl. Its only in my right leg, not my left. Just when the bend is almost complete I feel like a clicking or popping sensation in the back of my leg, about 5-10 cm above the knee cap. Its generally happens only when I do the action standing up, and it doesn't hurt, but its only one leg that does it which is odd. Can anyone explain what might be happening, and if its worth looking into or not?

I haven't changed anything in my schedule - no running or putting my knee through additional load/activities.
Nothing else aggravates it. I cannot avoid kneeling down at least once a day - but I don't know how I could do that painlessly.

"First, this is my third joint replacement surgery so I fully understand we all heal differently.
I am hoping to hear from anyone else who may have pain (like a fractured leg) down the outside of their operated leg and who may have discussed this with their surgeon or PT and what they may have said. I ask because it seems to be stronger now than a week ago. Of course I am now cane and walker free (90% of time). They are having a hard time scheduling my PT and when they do I will also ask them - it could be 7 to 12 days before that happens.
It is somewhat better when I remember to place my heel down first - still I would like to hear from others who have experienced this same issue.

"I underwent a knee revision some three years ago followed by a Extensor Mechanism Reconstruction some two year ago, then last year I had a MUA which has now seen me regain full ROM.
Sadly I'm not making much progress elsewhere and find myself in constant pain, the issues are when rising from a searing position, I have to stand for around ten seconds or so before the pain subsides and I can move. The other issue is when standing preparing food etc, etc without my walking aids I get a sharp excruciating pain under my knee and on the tibia bone, this literally freezes me to the spot and leaves me having to hold onto a surface to take my weight and then slowly lift my leg before I can attempt to move.
I've had my bloods taken to rule out an infection and a CT scan on Thursday to check for any loosening. I'm now awaiting the results of these so fingers crossed.

"Hi,
I had a left knee replacement operation about three and a half years ago for severe arthritus. It took me a long time to build up the courage to go through with the operation and managed the pain with steroid injections and Synvisc injections but after five years they were not effective and my only option was a knee replacement operation. So I summoned up the courage to go through with the operation.
I chose the best surgeon I could find and I am really pleased as I was driving and walking without crutches at four weeks.
My problem is now my right knee and since October I have started to experience the same pains as I had with the other knee. Apparently, I have moderate arthritus but I do not feel that it is bad enough at the moment to have a knee replacement.
My surgeon has offered me PRP injections which he reckons are better than steroid injection as they are supposed to slow the arthritus down although not cure it. Apparently, they are successful for about 70% of people who have slight to moderate arthritus. They are not available on the NHS and come at a cost.
Just wondering whether anyone has tried anything similar and and would be willing to share their experiences.
There is also the possibility of stem cell injections which seem to be becoming very popular

"Hi all,
One year ago I was happy fit 38 years old woman enjoying Yoga , Broga, weight lifting, occasional short sprint and any high impact classes. I have exercised 8-12 hrs a week and rest working three days 12 hrs long shift a week on my feet with no pain and any other problems.
Than I had a 2 weeks holiday staying home so without any thinking I kept going to my fitness as I normally did but continuously every day for two weeks .
At the end of this two weeks I developed tennis elbow so I was referred to physiotherapist. I also felt some aching around my knees and shoulders , but I was not thinking much about it and thought it was overworked muscles.
Physiotherapist gave me some exercises and told me to keep my fitness levels and maybe go running instead my usual activities. So I ran three continuous days and my knee started hurting so so much ( deep aching kind of pain- like my knees were rotten inside)
Another 2 busy long days at work and soon I was in tears and in so much pain I was not able to work anymore. Crepitus began along side with lots of pain.
Two weeks rest and pain settled. Back to work, physiotherapist advised low impact exercise . I have tried a yoga session and that was the last time in my life I did the class. due to pain afterwards.
Another off sick from work. I felt I had to beg my GP to send me to orthopaedics surgeon. GP has asked what was physio saying which was your knees are absolutely fine. Nothing wrong with them. So GP has send me for an X-ray -so with all frustration I have decided to have private MRI.
Written result was not very clear to me and pain was so intense, so decided to see private Orthopeadic in Slovakia (9 weeks since the pain began)
I was diagnosed with Chondropatio Patellae 1.utrq gr1-2 (SK)
I had intra-articular injections SYNOLIS twice with one month apart. I was advised slow pedaling 10-15 min on bicycle daily and swimming alowed + water exercises.
Finally 4 month time my orthopeadic appointment was coming up . I have seen orthopeadic medical doctor who explayned to me - something has happened in that two weeks.It will get better but it will not be like before. Diagnosis: Patelofemoral disfuncion. I was sent to physiotherapist.
By the time I saw the physio, 10 min of daily peddaling on bicycle and swimming
seems my symptoms aggravated so much I was sore to touch and very reluctant to bend my knee. Physiotherapist told me that she can not help me if I wont take my pain under the control with medication such us Gabapentin
or Amytriptiline and referred me to community pain team. Pain team advised Duloxetine , but I was worried masking the pain and caused further damage and I requested second opinion surgical instead of medical one. I also felt I was too young to start regular medication for life.
2 months time I have seen the orthopaedic surgeon who diagnosed me with. Unexplained bilateral anterior knee pain
Pain on lateral hip and buttock( that often click with pain from sitting up or down)
MRI only on my knees ordered and here I am 9 months time and the surgeon told me I have early articular cartridge changes -and all he can offer is steroid injection or local anaesthetic injections.
Told me that NHS does not approve arthroscopy and washout to early cartridge changes as it does not help and he can give me injections 3times a year.
I said I need to think about it and left with open appointment for 3 months.
Doctor said I can try local anaesthetic into my knee if I don’t want steroids. But I don’t see what that would do-really.
Doesn’t steroid deteriorate my condition further and break down cartledge? Or is this a myth? Can they leave me with no other help than regular steroids and to have me on medication for life?
I can not regain any previous exercise function and I am working 8 hrs shift instead of 12 and I am in constant pain and aching. All I do is resting my knees as they hurt all the time, I can not sleep and find good position as knees are sore to touch. I always waking up feeling soreness of my knees. Wearing jeans or anything touching my knees is uncomfortable and unbearable after little while. There is occasional day , I try to half squat or squat but with increased pain for the rest of the day so I do this very really as when pain increases it is hard to bare it.
I feel like my life is over and not sure what to do?
Why are they treating me like I have osteoarthritis?
Can my condition lead to osteoarthritis untreated?
Should I have steroids?
I am so so sorry for such a long story, but I feel that no one really cares, and does not mind how quickly my condition will get worse.
I am worried if I start having steroid I will need knee replacements in 5 years and no one will do it cos I would be too young for it.
I find it hard to work every day and I am worried for my future.

"Hi All,
So had first TKR left October 2018 first knee is awesome! Feels great! 2nd knee done Jan 2, 2019. I am 2 months post op. Surgeon wants to release me back to work the end of March. I work in a hospital 12 hr shifts 3 days in a row. My appointment for follow-up is March 19th. I called today for an earlier appointment because it feels so unnatural, pushing metal and especially on the side of the knee I feel something circular like the size of a quarter pushing. My bends are good but it's this pain that I'm having that is worrying me. I want and need to go back to work as scheduled but I'm just afraid something is wrong with this knee. Also, my other knee healed so nicely and I didnt have these issues with the first one. I know I shouldnt compare but I kinda am. Anyone with advice or had this as well??

"Had 6 week post TKR doctor appointment yesterday, and although doctor was very pleased with my ROM, he was slightly concerned that my leg doesn't flatten/straighten out better than it does. He said he's going to call the PT I'm working with to address this, which is great, however, when I mentioned that I need to return to work in 4 weeks (10 weeks post TKR), he said ""You're kinda putting yourself behind the 8 ball, so let's do what we can to get you ready"". I'm starting to walk more with a cane now, and I'm able to lift my leg while lying down, but not while sitting on the exam table with my legs dangling. Am I being unrealistic returning to work after 10 weeks? I work in a college in a position that does require me to be mobile, but not on a constant basis. I realize everyone heals differently, and I totally accept this is a lengthy process that requires lots of patience, I'm just a little concerned by my doctor's statement. Any advice, suggestions or comforting words lol, are greatly appreciated. Thanks!

It subsided after a time but since then my knee is sore and stiff and feels like it is going to collapse under me. I would love to hear if anyone else experienced anything like this. I lost my Dad 4 weeks ago and was wondering if this triggered something. Any advice welcome. THANK YOU

"Hi All,
Hope things are going well?
I have my 3 month post op check up with the osteo surgeon soon. I would like to know what questions others have asked (or wish they had afterwards!). I feel I am recovering quite well, no pain, just twinges and prickly sensation. I have not had the tight feeling around the leg above my knee for a while (the other leg does have it so it made me realize). I don't need a stick and no longer walk with a limp - hooray! I still haven't driven, mainly because I am so tired all the time (brain fog). I also haven't tried kneeling as I'm not sure when it will be OK; so I will ask. I will also be asking if he can check my other knee or if I have to be referred again as it's not bad enough yet. However, I do feel it is hampering my recovery. GG

RE: nighttime restless leg issue, which like many of you I also have. I have no trouble sleeping during the day - several times a day but oh the nighttime. I have tried eliminating daytime naps to see if that helped - it did not.Tonight I realized that I wear my anti-embolism stockings all day but remove them at night and I am wondering if the two things are related.
For those who have the restless leg do you wear stockings at night?
For me it is not the knee that bothers me at night it is the right side of my operated leg - I just want to massage and massage it (muscles), yesterday I tried a heating pad (oh it felt so good).

"So I saw the Surgeon yesterday. Insurance has cut off my PT. I told him I NEED the PT and deep tissue massage. Still numb, swollen, painful , STIFF, can't drive yet, very difficult getting into the tub/shower. Going down stairs tough, coming up normal. I told him the Tylenol 3 is not doing much at all. Could I get the Norco 5? No answer.
I told him my PT measured my ROM. 135 in good knee, 117 in surgical knee. Not increasing. He told, me everything is normal. THEN he says I am 2 weeks behind in healing. Isn't that special? So he says he will order more PT, 2 times a week for 46 weeks!!! Unbelievable!!! BUT it means NOTHING!
insurance makes the final decision. Have to wait and see. I sure can't do the deep tissue massage myself. He thinks at the end of Mach I should be good. REALLY????
Knee hurts all day. I do home exercises, ice keep me going but it doesn't take swelling down. It seems stiffer after.I have had 2 almost falls since surgery at home.
Oh, he said I may never get beyond the 117 ROM maybe 120 or 130. I asked him if I should try harder to pull when I do the slide on the bed. He says if I stretch it too much it will mess with the implant. Now I am afraid to stretch it too much.
Feeling down, confused, and wonder why NO ONE can tell me what to do to get better.....

" FELLOW TRAVELERS, Support and Chat ( FMS CFS/ME)
 The following was shared on the above forum and 
written by Clarissa Shepherd  
Recovery time - causes and symptoms
 Due to our type illness   FMS  CMF/SE  (I have Fibromyalgia)
 our immune system is overactive and/or deficient. This causes most anything to add a longer than normal recovery for us.
Some reasons are :
Overdoing
Stress
Being in an accident or injured
Having a procedure, testing, or surgery
Dental work
Any type of infection: sinus inf. UTI, etc
Being exposed to a chemical or perfume, etc.
This exhaustion may occur immediately after activity, stress, illness, injury, exposure, surgery or procedure or may be delayed by hours or days. Thus causing a complete crash.
Symptoms which may follow are:
Inability to concentrate
Low threshold of energy: both physically and mentally
Lack of stamina
Extreme pain
Flu-like symptoms
Living with our type of illness, doesn't leave room for a normal recovery time. Sadly, most doctors don't understand this issue. In turn, begin to run tests, have us come back in to the office, etc. This only adds to our already worn body.
I also have Diabetes and Hypothyroidism

"Hi everyone, for the past almost teo years, I've noticed that only my right knee is randomly getting a dull but very painful pain all around, including right above and below my knee cap. It mostly happens at night anywhere between 5pm and later, sometimes it begins later than midnight, and I've never been able to connect any patterns of what could be causing it. Some nights the pain bothers me too much where I am unable to sleep and any over the counter pain meds like Advil, etc, do not seem to help. I have noticed that movement does not cause it to hurt more or less, or resting it in the same position for extended periods of time, nothing seems to trigger the pain or worsen the pain when I happen to get it. It typically lasts around two or three hours. I have only a few thoughts about what this could be and would like someone's opinion, so thank you so much in advance!
In 2015, it was my final year of marching band and without any specific injury, (like a fall or bumping it, etc, to my knowledge), I ended up experiencing about a week or so worth of random extremely sharp pain a couple times a day in my knee, where it would then send a very sharp pain down the very front of my shin, causing it to buckle. It was very painful and I had to make a dumb face trying to deal with it the best I could until it was over. It would happen when I was sitting in my class or walking down the hall, and eventually I had a minor limp. Just like now, nothing encouraged it to be triggered in any way. I did go to the doctor for this because at the time I was afraid I actually did get some sort of injury and had an x-ray done but they did not x-ray my knee which was the main area of pain, they only x-rayed my shin. Nothing showed and the doctors INSISTED it was shin splints! I have had shin splints before from marching band and it was nothing like this! I tried explaining the best I could, the pain originated in my knee, and shot it down my shin and everything but their final answer was only shin splints. I trust nurses and medical professionals but in this case it was hard for me to. Could I have actually gotten an injury that would still be hurting me once and a while to this day?
Arthritis. My family has a history of arthritis and I know it can be passed down. My only doubt is that from what I know, movement does not create or cause pain and it mostly happens at night, even after days of very little use and after days of much more use, it is always the same pain no matter when I get it. I am very ignorant with what causes/ influences arthritis so if it was just that, it would make a lot of sense considering it is in the family!
More information that may or may not be useful:
I am currently 20 years old and female
I admit I am not at a great weight currently, but I have been losing weight recently and have had problems with my knee before my weight become a problem.
My entire knee and leg tend to pop or crack a lot, it's like cracking your knuckles.
Per month, out of the times I get this knee pain, maybe once or twice I will get the very sharp pain down my shin but it only ever lasts up to about 20 seconds before it goes away in my shin.

"I am exercising and going to the gym. I still cant lift my leg off the bed unless i use a belt to lift it up. When I do lift the leg I get pains like shin splints. I am doing exercises for my quads. I made a mistake of not focusing on my quads initially. These shin splints wake me at night. The surgeon had problems with my knee cap as it floated off to the side. Today at the gym an acquaintance who hadn't seen me in a couple of weeks commented that I wasn't improving since she last saw me.
Anyone else experiencing similar problems? I find it very depressing.

"Had my TKR (right leg) yesterday afternoon. A complete success.
One of the funniest things that has happened (so far) had to do with the spinal anesthesia I had. My thighs were still numb until late into the evening. The numbed area included my lady bits. When I adjusted myself on the bed (exertion) I felt something warm in my lower region. Yep seems I needed to urinate and had no idea and no idea I was doing it. It was actually pretty funny (twice)
All numbness in those areas were gone sometime overnight.
I 've had two hip replacements and now my knee - I am surprised how easy it is to get in and out of bed with the TKR. Though at this point I am fairly certain the actual incision and surrounding area is still numb - I'm going to enjoy this while I can LOL.
Physical Therapy will come by later today but I have tried to do some of the exercises I had to do at home over the last month (not so easy).
Happy Tuesday everyone
PS wow the are sending me home with an ""Iceman"" machine - I'd never heard of or seen one of these. There is a small chest with icewater in it and motor that is attached to a chilled pad that continuously stays cold on your knee. Very cool !!

"My wife suffered serious knee damage in her 20s when she was hit by a car. She lost a cruciate ligament and had pins inserted which due to complications are now there forever. In order to compensate for the damage, her doctors/ physios at the time told her to build up muscle mass around the knee to provide the strength and stability that she needed. This has served her well for 30 years but now her knees give her more trouble - partly due to osteoarthritis setting in. Her last consultant provided her with a Load Reduction Knee Brace which will apparently reduce pain, improve function and decrease the use of pain medication. However, she is concerned that the brace will cause the muscle mass around her knee to waste away (like muscle in a plaster cast) and is nervous about using the device and then becoming dependant on it. Anybody had experience of these devices that they can share?

Wasn't too bad, some were sorer than others to come out.
It feels really strange, I keep thinking that they were holding me together and now they are gone, afraid to move, haha.
Even though I don't feel like I am making progress with the exercises and bending, I feel good knowing that the staples are out as that is a bit of progress.
How did you all get on with the staples coming out? Did you feel any relief and did it make the bending and exercising easier?

"Hi all its been a while since i've posted been a bit busy with life. anyway the reason why i came onto this forum in the first place was to get answers due to a difficult recovery. I know recovery is hard so i thought what i was going through was the norm. I went for my yearly check up back in October and had an xray and was seen by an arthroplasty practitioner. There was a black shadow at the top of my Tibia and she thought it was a cyst and that she would refer me back to my consultant. i waited a couple if months and i hadnt heard anything so i saw him privately with my health insurance. He looked at my xray and said straight away that it looked like it had moved. He sent me for a bone scan and blood tests. The bloods came back normal no change in the inflammatory markers. The bone scan however shows a lot of activity in my left knee where i had the TkR . The radiographer has reported on it suggesting there could be an infection. I have been referred to another consultant who specialises in revisions and after seeing him he us sure there is an infection in my Tibia that has caused the loosening. He wants to aspirate the joint to confirm this. if there is an infection my implant has to come out and left out for 6 weeks and a course of Iv antibiotics given before doing the revision. Has anyone else here gone through all this. ive been told it is very rare

"Hi!
So I'm 3.5 weeks post op TKR. I have been doing very well, walking and stairs. Home therapy came to my home the first 2 weeks and all went good with that. I started outpatient physical therapy Friday. My extension was -5 and 0 with help and 113 flex 120 with help. The physical therapist was really surprised how good my knee was doing so quickly. Anyways we did exercises that felt ok at the time we were doing them. He admitted he pushed me hard considering how well the knee was doing. After leaving it immediately swelled and felt like it was on fire. I was in so much pain and 3 hours later bruising formed. I called the PT to let him know and he assured me to ice and elevate this was normal. Well here it is 2 days later and I'm now stiff, swollen in pain and hard to walk. I know the PT has to be done but I felt like my knee was recovering better before the physical therapy. Has anybody had a similar situation??

"Had first surgery with an allograph ~ 9yrs ago. Torn that one a few months after I got back to sports, admittedly I didn't take the rehab process very serious.
Had second surgery with an allograph 6 months later. Torn it again while running. Again poor rehab process.
Had third surgery (half my own hamstring & half allograph). Didn't play sports or do much activity, and now for whatever reason I have a hair-line of ACL left, not sure what happened to the rest of it.
I've seen few sports medicine orthopedics surgeons and they all suggested I get my fourth surgery with proper rehab follow up. One of the surgeons suggested I use my own patella graft, since it's the ""gold standard"", while the other surgeon said I should go with an allograph so he can customize the size of the tendon (this is important in his opinion in case I need a thicker tendon than what's available from my own patella).
Few of my family/friends have suggested I don't get another surgery.
Needless to say I'm quite conflicted and any advice/tips/suggestions would be much appreciated.
I'm in my early 30s btw.

"I am now 19 weeks post op. Pain meds are done, pain is controlled mostly but I do have some bad days or hours during the day. JUST NOTICED Pin on knee cap today. Stiffness is still present, somedays it seems like it has lessened yet later in the day or the next day it is back. I take this as a good sign that it is diminished at times. ROM is good, well over 120 for ROM and 0 or better for extension. Walking and standing after a bit are painful, 20 minutes of either can be problematic. Waiting for this very cold and now snowy and icy winter to pass so I can walk outside and not use the treadmill. My recumbent exercise bike and a regular bike on a trainer are used as well, no resistance. Had a setback the other day as I pulled a muscle in my back. Not able to do much and have felt my knee tighten. I can use the recumbent and stretch now, hoping for a quick bounce back, Just waiting and hoping now for improvement.

"Hi, I'm new to the forum and finding my way around. I'm in the UK and had my surgery at the South West London Elective Orthopaedic Unit in Epsom, came home Thursday. Pain has been pretty much as anticipated, but it's the nighttime ache at the back of the knee that's keeping me awake. Any suggestions? I'm also having trouble with the straight leg extension sitting and the straight leg raise. I didn't anticipate it being so difficult or painful to lift my leg when I had no trouble before! Any advice gratefully received.

My right knee has been numb for about 24 hours. Its the same sensation you get when a limb has fallen asleep, but it doesn't go away. The numb area is about 2 inches squared right below the kneecap. I can still bend and stretch the knee normally, but it feels kinda heavy when i walk. I cant think of anything i've done recently that could cause this. What could it be?

I have already had one manipulation under anesthesia almost two weeks ago which which did me absolutely no good.

"Advice needed please. I am 59 years old, female and have a painful right knee. I always walk with a limp due to pain and discomfort. Approx 2+ years ago I had an arthroscopy due to a torn Meniscus. At the time the consultant told me my joint was ""bone on bone."" My knee is constantly swollen despite icing and elevation. On a good day I am able to walk about 2 miles. About 1 mile of this will be in discomfort. I walked for about two miles today and as normal after walking, my knee is now aching, swollen and very painful on standing. I know it is never going to get any better but the fact that I can still walk some distance, do I hold of having the TKR or do I just go for it? One of my favorite things is I have always enjoyed doing is walking; going for long walks in the country with my dogs. I purchased an electric bike last year and enjoy going out on this but suffer with a painful knee following using it. How bad should my knee be before having a TKR? Thanks for any advice.

"I hit a plateau at about 6 weeks post TKR and last week, at 8 weeks, my surgeon recommended an MUA, which I had yesterday. I was very excited when he told me he had gotten me to 135 degrees on the table and even showed me a picture of my heel right up against my butt!
I felt like my bend would really be able to improve, as I no longer felt restricted at the front of the knee, where all the scar tissue was, although my thigh is very sore from the manipulation and that is what is now keeping me from bending.
BUT... today I went for my first post-MUA physical therapy and measured at ... exactly the same 95 degrees where I had plateaued. Moreover, when I told my PT that my surgeon wanted me to continue to come for therapy 5 days a week until I reached 125, she was dismissive, saying that the surgeons tend to be more optimistic than realistic and she doubted I could get that far. Also, he was very clear that he wanted me to do only land therapy for the first two weeks rather than aqua therapy, because I would progress more that way, whereas she said she thought aqua therapy would be more helpful to me as it would allow me greater range of motion. I am in tears now and very depressed. I knew I woudn't be going in today at the 135 he got me to on the table, but I'd thought I would have made at least some progress. And the PT's comments undermining my surgeon's advice were also difficult to take. I feel that I have to follow the surgeon's advice rather than the PT's but overall I'm very discouraged. Any words of advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated.
BTW ... I do have to say that I found the MUA itself pretty much as advertised. I woke up in the recovery room (anesthesia was light sedation) in a lot of pain but it actually subsided pretty quickly. I left the hospital within 3 hours, pain well managed with Norco 5/325, and I had a good night. Even planning to go back to work day after tomorrow!

"Tomorrow will be 3 weeks since my December 17, 2018 TKR surgery. I don't have staples. I have stitches under the skin and glue holding the incision closed. I told the surgeon my biggest concerns were pain control and swelling . He didn't think it would be a problem. I was given 5mg of Norco 325. It doesn't even TOUCH the pain!!! Three days later I ended up back at the hospital and they kept me overnight and upped my Norco to 10mg! I can only take it every 6 hours.
Since the bandage has come off the swelling is worse. I am icing 4-6 times a day. It fees great while ice is on but 10 minutes after I take it off my knee and whole leg is swollen and hurting again.
My knee and leg burn, sting and itching on feet, legs, and around knee is driving me NUTZ! I not a big baby or whiner but this is wearing me down.
PT says to walk less and sit more and elevate my leg. I can't plan for anything. Using a walker and really don't need it much but can't walk far without pain. I can't straighten my knee on the bed, or bring it all the way up to my other bent knee. I am doing all the exercises they recommend but one day I might feel a tad better the next I am in agony. The first week I was in so much pain it was affecting me mentally. Never was told about the enormous bruises and pain they bring, plus the groin and back of knee
pain. I can't imagine this going on for ANOTHER 3 months let alone 3 or 6 months more. How in the world does everyone deal with all this? Are there any creams that can be used to ease pain, have heard of CBD oil but never tried it. I am retired, my poor husband is doing everything for me. Sorry if you are experiencing these symptoms as well . Thanks for listening....Eileen

"I am a 20 year old female of average body type. I grew up dancing competitively and played volleyball and ran track (a distance runner) throughout high school. I have experienced chronic knee pain since I was at least 14. While I stopped running and began practicing yoga several years ago to address my
'bad knees,' I still experience chronic pain. It is heightened during extended periods of either stagnation or standing. When I am experiencing this pain, it feels like inflammation in the sides of my knees that only cracking and stretching somewhat relieves. I saw an orthopedic doctor years ago who did an x-ray and essentially dismissed my pain. I am desperate to find some natural remedies and/or alternative medicine practices that can reduce/relieve this pain. I am far too young to have such painful joint issues! Any personal anecdotes or medical recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

All in all the knee is progressing as the last one did and the surgeon was more than happy at my 6 week check up. Big help this time was the physio she spent so much of the time doing deep manipulation and massage and left the exercise to me at home really,dont get me wrong she checked the bend start and finish everytime but this really seemed to take the swelling down and certainly broke up the scar tissue.Everything good at present but still wary and careful dont want any set backs if possible.Hope all you guy's going through this now, IT DOES GET BETTER it may no feel like it sometimes but stick in there, best wishes all.

"A few months ago, my able bodied , generally fit and well, 83 year old mother started getting some pain in the right knee. Then three weeks ago, her left knee (the other knee) then gave way in the supermarket. She was able to get up and continue on walking. She describes that the angle between her lower and upper legs was not normal due to the knee giving way…but said she was able to get up and continue walking. Then 5 days ago, the left knee again gave way in the house….but again she was able to just get up and continue walking.
She says there was not that much associated pain.
She has now booked herself in to see the doctor.
Should she avoid walking on the knee?
Also, is there any kind of knee support that might help her.
Also, are there any exercises that will help this?

"I had a TKR on 21st November last. In addition, in order to partially correct a walking disability, the lower leg was rotated by a few degrees relative to the upper leg. Due to the disability the leg has never been able to completely lay ""flat"" but since the TKR this situation has worsened and I can neither straighten the leg to the extent that I could prior to the operation, nor can I support my weight on the leg and walk. I feel a lot of the problem is that I have lost a great deal of muscle strength in the leg and in an attempt to rectify this I now use a mini, pedal type, exerciser. Occasionally the knee hurts quite a bit using this, so its use is a little intermittent. The knee is not too painful most of the time, only the lower leg and foot are a bit swollen and this is lessening.
Obviously my worry is will I ever walk again and I would appreciate hearing if anyone has had a similar experience to me and what the outcome is likely to be.
Thanks and Regards,

Anyway, I've opted for surgery, and I think that my doctor is planning on a partial menisectomy, like she performed last year, but I've been doing a lot of research, and it shows that people tend to fare better long term when they have repairs instead partials.
Can I ask my surgeon if she can try to do a repair? I know that sometimes repairs aren't physiologically possible, but I would rather save as much of whatever is left of my meniscus if I can. You know?
What are your thoughts? And how should I approach my doctor?

"Most of what I had read or heard about Total Knee Replacement (TKR) led me to believe that I would be up and walking about in a few days after the operation. So it has been a bit worrying for me that over five weeks after the operation, that whilst I can easily bend the knee, I cannot straighten the leg or put enough weight on it to walk! However I have been heartened to read here that my situation is quite common and that, hopefully what is required is patience.
I have read that i should be drinking a lot of water. As one who, at the age of 75, prefers to keep my liquid intake down, I would like to know the reason for this.
In addition I would like any information on people's experiences of extended periods before walking was possible.

Just updating on my surgery on 1-2-18. So this left knee replacement (knock on wood) seems to be going great so far! I had my right knee replaced Oct 15 2018 and it seemed a lot more painful and difficult. I had PT at my home for my first session yesterday(Friday)my flexion was 96 and my extension was -11. When I had the right one done day one flexion was 72 and extension was 42. So I am super excited and beyond blessed with this new knee! I am walking on it to the bathroom unassisted and the pain had subsided as of now. I was in a bit of pain last night and this morning but I'm feeling so good right now. I just hope the new knee stays this way! My PT was so happy with my numbers now compared to the other knee and seems to think ""its gonna be a piece of cake"" compared to the first knee. Thank you for everyone's support!! You guys are all the best and have made my knee surgeries so much easier with you all to talk to!

The dirt was uneven on the other side of the wall and so I landed hard and crooked. My leg bent sideways quite a lot more than it ever had before. The pain was immediate and walking was instantly more difficult. The temperature outside was below freezing so my legs were already a somewhat numb.
When my legs were warmed up once again and I was lying in bed the knee swelled considerably but my knee cap was in place. It became harder to bend my knee but it wasn't bad enough that I couldn't walk.
The next day there was numbness on my foot and today that numbness increased although I can bend my knee more now and the pain has decreased. I really want the numbness to go away, its driving me nuts.

Throat is very sore from the tube they put down it during surgery. I have been sleeping in 2 hour increments. As long as everything goes well this morning I will be going home later today!
Thank you everyone for your support, it really helps to talk to everyone that knows what I'm going through!

"Anyone ever had/heard of this? Google brings very little and I'm struggling to manage my symptoms. Surgery is months away (if at all) anti-inflammatory drugs don't work and nor do painkillers. This is a ganglion cyst that sits under my kneecap and gets trapped during the standard mechanical use of my knee, causing it to swell,click,lock and jar. It has also caused my knee to become very unstable. Any suggestions to help my symptoms appreciated.
TIA

"Hello all. Just hit 15 weeks after TKR I still am very stiff, have a good day or partial day here and there since last week. Just weaning off pain meds for a couple of weeks as I have built up a slight addiction to them (as to be expected) but taking only 1/2 tab dilaudid twice a day. Pain is still present when I walk, I am doing 15-20 minutes on the treadmill daily, stretching and strengthening exercises daily. I also do errands so on my feet or walking as much as I can daily. the stiffness is maddening as is the pain from movement. Doc thinks I am doing fine and I know we all heal differently.
I will see the surgeon in 2 weeks and see what he now thinks. Sleeping is not a problem, I did spend the first 4 or more weeks in my recliner.
That's where I am at this point in time, sort of counting to 6 months when I hope things will be much better

"Hi. Please advise me. My 13 year old son is a keen footballer. On 2nd Dec he was tackled and his foot was planted resulting in a nasty twist to his knee. At first I thought it wasn't that bad as he went back on the pitch after 10 mins, but on getting home he couldn't get out of the car. Ice and ibuprofen etc. Next morning he was no better so we went to A&E to be told it's a minor sprain of the ACL , use these crutches for 48 hrs but you must walk on it.
He fell on it at school the following day and then it locked completely. The gp said A&E had misdiagnosed and it seemed more like MCL. Referred us back to A&E who this time said it would take 4 weeks to heal properly but he MUST start putting weight on it. They even told him off for using his crutches wrong. No follow up, nothing. He was really struggling at school so after 10 days or so I took him back to the gp who got us an urgent referral to orthopaedic specialist the next day and into the physio system. He got given a huge knee brace and referred for an MRI scan. Told it's his MCL but there might be a meniscus tear too.
The physio was Xmas Eve and the MRI scan was 27th so some progress, but his level of pain still prevents anything but the most pathetic of physio exercises and the physio man was concerned with the level of pain, and the earliest follow up I was offered with the orthopaedic is still in 4 weeks, (at first they offered me end of Feb)
My son can't even take a step, can bearly move his knee beyond a few degrees (the physio is supposedly building this up) and it's now 4 weeks today. It seems to have made very little/no progress.
A friend said I should take him back to the gp to see if they can hurry things up. Am I being impatient? He's 13! Football is his thing! We surely can't wait another 4 weeks before any news on the MRI even! He can't even access all his classrooms at school on crutches.

"On Nov 13th, i had my knee cap replaced on my left leg. For the last 3 weeks, I've been measuring 60 degrees (70 painful degrees). PT ordered me a dynasplint brace. I get it on Monday, and supposed to wear it 6hrs every day. I've been working from home because i can't bend my knee enough in order to drive. Has anyone else been in this situation? How long did it take the brace to get your knee bending? I need to drive as I need to go back to work sooner than later. I'm getting depressed being couped up in my house & relying on others to drive me around.

"Hi everyone, I had my LTKR exactly 7weeks ago. I'm doing really well according to my surgeon BUT in the last 5 days, (since i've seen him of course) i'm getting the most debilitating shin pain at night! It started the first night i stopped the targin tablet. I added it the next night and it was better, but since then WHAM. The aching/pain is terrible. I've been doing much more on my feet most of the day because of Christmas, visitors, etc, but also trying to ice 3x day.
I am walking more and doing extra leg work and stretches on my pilates reformer bed.
The pain doesn't happen during the day, only at night.
ANY IDEAS?

"I had TKR on my left knee march 5th this year and the knee seized at 50 ROM 5 weeks post op. Consultant diagnosed Arthrofibrosis and recommended an MUA . This was done this monday 17th December after a 7 month wait ( normal waiting time for NHS procedure in my area. He managed to get it to 90 ROM in theatre and i was admitted as an inpatient for 48 hours on a CPM once on the machine i could only manage a ROM of 55 at first but slowly got it back to 90. i was discharged home on wednesday afternoon and told that i would receive community physio at home for the next 10 days excluding xmas day and boxing day. Thursday morning I woke up and my knee was so swollen it measured 22 inches. It was also extremely painful. I found that it had seized up again. I waited for physiotherapist to arrive, but despite leaving three messages they did not contact me or turn up. Again today I waited and still no physiotherapy. I cannot get my knee to move at all. it is now 23 inches swollen and really painful. I rang my GP who told me to call physio, but no answer, so i rang my consultants secretary but the office is closed until December 27th I Rang the hospital ward who just told me to ring physio, so ive just been going in circles. it feels like my knee joint is not responding. i can only move it about an inch if i physycally hook my right foot over my left ankle and pull it in and its agony to do that, even with the strong painkillers i have been prescribed. i tried to order a CPM to rent but there are non available until the new year. its like the whole thing has been a complete waste of time and i feel so deflated. Has anyone experienced anything similar? or have any advice or information they can pass I would be extremely grateful.
kindest regards Kerrie

"Start on a positive,been to see Mr Sudakhar for my follow up conceltation a week earlier than normal, he was absolutely delighted with the knee progress ROM 110+ and a straight leg, ive just started climbing up the stairs normally, but coming down still a bit wary. Iv'e still got swelling round the knee and will for a long while yet,walking the dog a couple of miles a day then icing when i return.The negative is still sleepless nights, taking zolpadem for sleep but it lasts maybe 3-4 hours then thats it awake, actually that tired it makes me feel physically sick ( but not sick) i would be interested if anyone else felt the same, i mentioned it to Mr Sudakhar and he said yes common effect of this surgery, but i should soon see a sleep improvement,again no pain just a very sensitive scar and stiffness in the knee as the night progresses and the need to keep moving leg position. Using a pillow between my legs and bio oil for the scar.So all thats left to say is HAPPY CHRISTMAS to everyone and god bless.

We live 3 1/2 hours from where I got my surgery so by the time I got home my knee was still hurting along with my foot . So I thought that was just from sitting in the car. I have what is called foot drop. I have never heard of this before and I was wondering if anyone out there knows anything about this. So now I am making the 3 1/2 drive earlier than my appointment the day after Christmas. To see My Doctor. The first week after my surgery all I did was sleep now I’m getting no sleep and my foot hurts more than my knee. How strange is this

"I'm 7 weeks post op and whilst Ive made some progress I'm still not where I'd expected or hoped to be in my recovery-the main thing is that whatever I achieve through exercise and determination all just goes the minute I stop-I'm unable to maintain any bend-each day I'm starting from the same point regardless how well I'd done the previous day-its so frustrating and there are times when I wonder why I'm bothering with the exercises as they seem to be getting me no where, obviously I do keep on with them. I can manage to walk with only a slight bend but I cant maintain this for much longer than 10/15 minutes or so before the knee swells and I stop being able to walk without swinging my leg-peg leg walk. Any one out there experienced anything similar or any help or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Watty.

"Hi all - I promised myself that I'd do this and kept forgetting, so here goes.
I had a TKR in May 2017. It was a rough recovery, and after about 10 weeks, I had an MUA. After that, things moved along quickly in the right direction. A few months later I traveled to Peru (a trip I canceled the year before to have the surgery) and did a lot of hiking. For some reason, this past summer I had a temporary setback for no apparent reason, which really freaked me out but it only lasted a week. I have incredible flexion and no pain and am so happy. This site has been very helpful to me, but those of you going through the worst of it, keep in mind that most people that are doing well (myself included) no longer visit. That's why I promised myself that when I was better, I would.
My best advice:
You've heard it before, but don't compare yourself to anyone else. There is such a wide range of recovery times with this surgery.
Take your pain meds and do the PT exercises right away. That was a big part of my issue. I have a very high tolerance to opioids (& all meds) and although my doc was great and tried different ones, nothing really helped with the pain and I developed scar tissue.
So, keep your collective chins up and do whatever you have to, including letting friends and family help. Best of luck to everyone.

"My date is set to get my TKR revised. December 28th. I am excited and nervous at the same time. But to possibly put 16 months of unnecessary pain behind me and being misdiagnosed for 12 of those months by the surgeon, makes it all worth it.
I left my network, returning to my old practice in PA, to get this done.
Any advise and prayers it all goes well will be appreciated.

"After 5 surgeries due to: installing a PKR - cleaning out 2 infections and replacing a PKR with a spacer, PICC line antibiotics (twice) and having to operate to remove a staple that migrated to the back of the knee, I have to say that things are looking very, very good for a change, for my wife. We had a top notch team of two doctors doing the operation with 50 years of combined practice in knee/hip surgery.
Previous surgeries always seemed to have constant drainage and slow wound healing/closure. But after her latest surgery on Monday of this week, she is remarkably strong, NOT in any pain and has darn near full mobility, I would say, to guess, 0 degrees to 100 degrees after 4 days. Walking around with a walker (sometimes not). has NO drainage and redness or major swelling like before.
Been following the exercises and Chico Marx's detailed instructions and I think they are really helping (thanks Chico - say: ""Hi to your brothers"".)
After reading some postings of patients with problems, I was really pleased to see Anne's progress. Hopefully everything will be fine going forward; Anne's really ""paid-her-dues"" and deserves some finality to a year-and-a-half of setbacks.
We love to travel and haven't since last October, 2017, so we are starting to think about heading out again in the spring.
Will try to post as she gets better and better!
I'm posting this positive info so people thinking about whether or not to get the TKR will be encouraged and not dread the decision because of perceived problems. Of course it should only be attempted when all else fails and immobility/ pain are severe.

Anyway i'm doing sit stands, now walking daily 500m icing and resting but i feel like every day is a slow punishment. ROM 90+ in the shower am but decreases during the day despite icing elevating etc. I'm using 2 crutches lightly to make sure i'm not putting stress on anything else. I have a pilates reformer bed and have done two VERY light (2 red springs)leg work sessions mainly controlled stretches. I Plan to do this alternating days. Thank you for a site to vent. My hubby is a GP who's been trying very hard to be helpful, but not really too empathetic, and my dear daughter is 5mths post double lung transplant, so i really don't want to whinge. Honestly i could cry most afternoons at the thought of another poor nights sleep and the prospect of facing another day!

"Had a left TKR in 2016 I had a lot of knee pain afterwords it even radiated down below my knee. The Dr removed a screw from a previous ACL reconstruction so I thought the pain below my knee was from the screw removal. About a year ago my left started aching. a Dr visit an MRI he determined my knee pain was radiating down from my lower back. By the time further testing was done the pain was gone. WELL in has returned and with a vengeance ! An MRI showes a herniated disc . The pain I now have is in my left knee and radiating down from my knee and numbness from my knee to my foot. All this to say that I'm pretty sure my sciatica was acting up after my TKR because the pain then was similar to what I am having now. Thanks George

"Many years ago i was told my painful knee was a bursitis, that was it. no follow up. as the years went by the pain continued and i was sent for xrays of the hips and knees. I was told about three years ago that I had arthritis of the hips and would need replacements in a couple of years. I remember thinking at the time its my knee not my hips thats causing me so much pain. i now know my hips hurt badly too.
AS time has gone by and several trips to the dr and a couple of cortisone injections my knee problems got worse, to the stage i now hobble and need a walking aid and am in constant pain.
I asked to be referred for a replacement knee and was seen quickly. i had xray of knees and was told that they wasn't too bad. i mentioned the hips and the consultant looked back at the old xray and said that was the cause of my knee pain and would consider me for hip replacements.
i have put the op on hold as i need another for another problem.
Going back to the bursitis could that the cause of my swollen knee which feels mostly warm to the touch and hurts when active or at rest.

"Hello, I am new to the forum and wondered if anyone could give me any insight into my problem.
I fell onto my knees about 6 months ago and ever since I have had a sharp pain at the front of both knees on going upstairs and downstairs.
I finally went to the Doctor a week ago and had an X Ray. The findings were that there wasnt any loose cartilage which has confused me as, it does feel like there is something very sharp directly under my kneecaps.
His diagnosis was that I have some fluid around my knee. I have no symptoms of this. No swelling or stiffness.
I am going to see him again tomorrow morning but I wondered if anyone else has had my symptoms with fluid on the knee.
My symptoms sound more like Patellefemoral syndrome to me, but would that have showed up on an X Ray?
And advise you could give me would be very much appreciated as I am totally confused!

"I'm 45 years of age had a tkr in April 2017 ,from day one I felt something wasn't right ,but not knowing anything about this operation I was guided by my surgeon ,I got to the 3 month mark and after having 5 surgeries prior to the tkr ,I had a great deal of scar tissue and with persistence and a lot of pain I broke a lot of it up and I had gained nearly 125 degree bend ,but also while doing this I kept saying to my surgeon it doesn't feel right ,I was told that things will settle with time ,well time has gone by and at the 12 month mark a bone scan and ct were done ,they showed hot spots all over the knee ,and I was told it's just to early to say its come loose ,I'm now at the 18 month mark and the latest scans have showed the tibual component has come loose ,this whole time my knee has been so swollen and weight bearing so painful ,it has got me so depressed that I'm struggling with life on a day to day basis ,and while being heavily sedated on anti depressants ,and walking with the aid of a walking stick ,I've been limping the whole time ,now after scans of my back ,it has endured all the stress of my limping and now I'm suffering terribly with lower back pain and a knee which to weight bear on is so painful and just sitting down I have a constant ache ,I'm too scared to go under for revision surgery as I have lost faith in the surgeon ,mentally and physically I'm not ready for this operation again ,everything I was told about this tkr has been the complete opposite, any suggestions ,I'm really struggling mentally and physically and in the process I've got independent doctors saying I'm fit to work ,so I'm fighting a system which doesn't work ,I was injured at work and now I'm paying the price for that .

"First week past still a lot of swelling as expected,knee bend is poor again as expected,walking around the house without the stick,dont actually feel the stick is doing anything for me around the house,always using it outside when i walk to the top of our street 5min there 5 back 3 times a day,The knee feels pressurised still with the swelling the inside of the knee, hamstring and ankle are pretty black and blue but this time the sides of the knee are not red hot like last time, warm but that's all. Pain is there but i only came out of hospital with blood thinning tablets and the pain is under control with just paracetamol a couple of times a day.I'm using voltarol on my knee as well,good stuff that (but not cheap) Got phenergan of my GP to aid my sleep (as last time) one box only to get past this first and worst period.Physio gave me some exercises to do for the first couple of weeks (start proper physio when i get the staples removed end of next week) the one where you put a rolled up towel under your knee and raise you foot a couple of inches,omg far to painful and i mean painful so that one's a no no for now, but managing the others to some degree,luckily i can cryo cuff ice compression my knee (often)that's a big help.All in all ok up to now patience and not going stir crazy in the house and not piling the weight on as well is tough, see how it goes,will report in again week 2

"I am going in 4 months post op and am in the same boat....hurts to walk, hurts when I sleep, using a extension board to try and help with extending, but it isn't helping, just causes more pain, faithfully going to physical therapy, but it's getting worse. Can only bend to 110-115 and extension is 10-11 . They say its scar tissue and I need a manipulation to break it up, but it may not help with straightening and I need to keep doing the board. I am so frustrated and depressed....I was doing well and then started going backwards. It just aches all the time and I am limping worse than before I had the surgery........

"Hi all , My sister in law have now been off work for several weeks now and has been referred to a specialist knee surgeon who has confirmed she requires a full knee replacement and the other knee is not good either which is scheduled for Jan 2019 . Whilst this is a good way forward to alleviate the immense pain she is experiencing . I have concerns about her welfare after she leaves hospital as she lives in a maisonette which has no toilet upstairs and the kitchen downstairs .
I have asked her to make contact now with her council and also social services to see what support she can receive, but all that has been offered is an assessment when she comes home .
Can anyone suggest anywhere else that she can try ? at the moment she has to slide down the stairs on her backside to the toilet and kitchen and when she wants to sleep then has to pull herself up the stairs to bed as she cannot stand or bend on the problem legs
To add to the problem we live in the midlands and she lives in London
Any help or suggestions appreciated

"My second one is different. It's taking longer. They were both very similar pre-op. Both needed a lot of straightening and re-alignment. This one at six months is giving tenderness and sometimes sharper pain on the lateral part of my knee where the lateral co-lateral ligament (I believe) is. It feels like it catches on something and locks. Then it takes up to a day to be able to straighten it and relieve the pain. Surgeon said it might be catching on some soft tissue and should go away and physio has worked on it with no effect. If anyone ever had a torn cartilage lock they would know the feeling.
Just wondered if anyone else had this? So many different problems on here!

In February this year i fell and broke my patella ... which led me to have TkR in June ... right from day 1 . i was allergic to all pain and post op meds.. physio out the question as i couldnt stop vomitting ... i lost 7 kgs in just over a week ... my leg was stuck at -20 plus degrees.. despite excruciating pain .. we tried everything to straighten.. finally a MUA in July .. i was put in a brace to keep it straight for 3 days post surgery .. as soon as i attempted to take the brace off.. back up at times to -20 again ... i know maintain around -10 ... and under manipulation my my physio . i can get as low as -5 ... my flexion is about 110 ... my physio has tried everything ... she says i have alot of fluid around my patella and tne knee itself doesnt look normal .. i couldnt walk far without getting sciatica ... was only sleeping an hour at a time with cramps and spasms keeping me awake all night ..
Has anybody got any advice for me? .. just reading your posts helps as i feel so hard on myself .. i thought id do this easy .. my weight has gone up and I havent been able to work since FEBUARY ... plus so far its cost about 23 k over our health insurance .

After 7 months of badgering my consultant and being sent for second and third opinions ive finally been given a date to go in for an MUA on the 17th December. my consultant told me that because its been so long since the TkR the MUA may not be succesful and there is a danger that something could go badly wrong because of the force needed. i am both angry ( as ive been asking for one since APRIL) and im really anxious because of the possible bad effects. I live alone and dont have family nearby to help if thing go wrong. has anyone on here had a succesful MUA after so long ? and if so what was the recovery like? . i live in the north of england.

I've done a lot of kneeling over the last weekend and then started to feel like when i knelt down even on soft surfaces, i was kneeling on something sharp even though I wasn't.
i sometimes also feel it if i brush past it with my clothes or if i turn over in bed. it's strange that if i try to cause the pain i can't unless i kneel.
no swelling. no bruising and no issues walking or anything.
any ideas what this is? I've read about bursitis but that seems to suggest selling as well.
i can't take anti inflammatory medication due to having spinal surgery in April for some reason so anything else i could do?

"Ive had the above procedure on both knees. There was no improvement either time and it hurt like hell.
Ive since been through a TKR in June 2017, which is being ripped out next March, as its a shambles and has left me so much worse than I was after 20 years of bone on bone. However, I digress.
I have a client who is very senior person in private health care. I mentioned my Arthroscopies which resulted in a chuckle.
Essentially, these procedures are the 'bread and butter' of the private health care world. Easy money in effect.
In 2017 the NHS produced a report calling arthroscopies 'a waste of time' in most cases...Google it..
The message therefore is, think really hard and ask some searching questions of your surgeon before you go ahead..
Another friend of mine always asks any surgeon 'how many times he has been sued' !
Im sure I will be back on this forum after my revision. If anyone has any experience of a revision, would be interested to see how it compared to the original TKR, in terms of discomfort, recovery time etc...

"Hello there,
I have posted before about my ongoing knee problems. Summary:
Ongoing knee pain form 2011, physio, steroid injections (no relief) knee arthroscopy, microfracture & chondroplasty in 2013 - not a good result, more steroid injections, repeat of surgery in 2015 - some relief then gradual deterioration to 2017, usual round of physio & steroids,
Have been diagnosed with pes ansurinus and a steroid injection would cure - it didn't
Bad alignment with the thought of tibial osteotomy - disregarded after repeat xrays and mri
Bad arthritis on patella and thought of knee cap replacement
Led to repeat arthroscopy in 2018 and chondroplasty again - no real results from this.
I didn't particularly like the last surgeon.
As no real result asked to see different consultant who said knee cap not too bad. It's the trochlear groove that is bad. Also I am very wobbly - not ligaments or muscle - they are as good as they can be (I have been doing my physio well since 2013!!) But my hips are slightly too far forward and I have some lower limb torsion (I think)
So he is offering the thought of a trochlear - no so much replacement but putting a shield over it - that's how I understand it anyway - to alleviate the patella and trochlear situation. Apparently it's reasonably rare - he does about 2 or 3 a year.
He said I would inevitably need a TKR in the future due to the arthritis - which is everywhere but not terrible in other places. I could carry on for another 10 years till I have a TKR or I could go for this in the meantime.
I am in constant pain - some days are bad. Driving is a real issue, Sitting with my knees at right angles is an issue. I've had a bad week this week - to the point of crying with pain, co-codamol, ibuprofen and voltarol gel to manage. Some weeks are not as bad.
So what to do? This week I would have happily gone in for any surgery to try to help. Maybe next week won't be as bad. Can I cope with another 10 or so years of this - I'm not convinced.
I do understand that there is no guarantee of success but should I give it my best shot
I've had 5 surgeries in 5 yrs - 2 for another problem - it's been a lot.
I'm in the UK and I'm 55 - have a job where I have to be able to drive and get up and down off the floor
Any thoughts appreciated, thank you

My bones were so small the replacement took 4 hours , tbey could not find the right size. The knee never worked right and after a year and a half, doc went in to find severe arthritis where I didn't have any previous. So, I am now healing a full replacement. The hardest part of this is the mind, I was a very healthy active 58 yr old. I am now sedentary and 60. I know it is a matter of patience, the dr had the proper size, he said, the smallest one they make. This site gives me hope. Yesterday I walked to our barn, the first tI'm in a couple of years.

"I had TKR last September and have been having issues since then, even before then. I have a hematoma on the right side of that knee that was there before my surgery. I was hoping the surgery would fix it because I was told by multiple surgeons, it's there because of the bad knee.
I had the surgery and the hematoma is worse then ever and hindering my recovery. I spoke to my surgeon about it and he said its caused by a tendon that has partially detached. I have three treatment methods I could go with, two of which won't work.
Get the hematoma drained. I've gotten it drained twice and each time it filled up within a week. Also risking infection every time they stick a needle in the knee.
Wait and see if the fluid reabsorbs. I've had this for a couple of years and it's just getting bigger.
Surgery to reattach the tendon. This is my only option BUT my surgeon said it's a 50/50 . Because there is so much damage already done to the tendon he said it may detach again.
I need this fixed because I am in so much pain and I'm afraid it's going to affect my new knee. My whole body hurts because I'm not walking right and its throwing my spine out of alignment.
Does anyone have any advice?

"In august i landed on my knee weird playing softball and thought i tore my acl. After going to the ER the doctors did the normals manual tests on me and said it wasnt my acl but a possible knee sprain. I was relieved in took it easy on my knee for 3 months while strengthening my muscles that surround the knee gradually. 
I was standing up from sitting down( in a complete full squat down, like a child squats, glutes to my calves) as i was getting up a shooting pain shot towards the side of the knee (just by the fibula) and i could not extend my knee nor could i flex it back. It locked with my knee half/3/4s bent
I fell down on my butt not knowing what to do. after trying get my knee to unlock it finally let up and unlocked. a minor sensation went down my leg after the knee unlocked. 
I am trying to see if this could be a meniscus or patella issue, itband, i just down know what issue this could be or where to start. Any information on the subject would be great.
My knee has been moving when i get into bed bending my knee (indian style) getting into bed, which i have noticed over the past few weeks.

"Had plica surgery a year ago. Fell 6 months ago. Used the elliptical machine on Thursday night. Friday I was fine. Saturday very painful, no noticable swelling. Had done a lot of going up and down stairs. Sunday I used the knee brace and did limited walking and no stairs. Today I used the knee brace again and limited the bending of my knee. I did use ice. There is slight swelling on the lower, inner portion of my knee, but you have to be looking for it. Slight improvement. GP pressed on the area with the slight swelling. Extremely painful. He says bursitis. Which would be your guess? Aches even at rest.
Thanks.

"I had an arthroscope done about a year ago and plica fixed in my knee. It was great. No pain and all seemed well. Then, in late March I fell directly on that knee. It didn't hurt at the time as I fell on the ground and it was kind of soft. Not frozen anymore and soft from moisture. Well, off and on since then it has hurt a little but not all the time and not badly so I just ignored it and went on. Well, yesterday I decided to try out the eliptical machine. That seemed to do it, my knee started to hurt so I quit. Today, going up and down our stairs to do laundry is making it much worse. Going down is easy, but up really hurts. It hurts on the inside edge of my knee and a little bit directly under the knee cap, but mostly on the edge. What do I do now? Thanks.

"I fell hard onto my knee when I was pregnant with my now 14 month old son. Due to being pregnant, they would not do an xray, but they did do an ultrasound, nothing was found except for swelling and bleeding. There was a lump, I cant remember the word used to describe it, may of been hematoma, that they measured on top of my knee cap, the US ruled out bursitis and ligament injuries. I was told to rest and it would be fine.
Well its been almost 2 years, there is still mild swelling and the lumps are still in my knee. I don't have pain walking, but sometimes the joint aches, if I sit down and lift my leg and swing my leg, the joint clicks every time, my other knee is fine. If someone bumps my knee (I have 4 young kids, it happens often lol) its it's extremely painful.
Ive seen the dr a few times but feel like they're not overly concerned, I think it at least needs more investigating, they just tell me its fine and send me on my way.
Ive attached an image, the red dots are roughly the area and size of the lupms in my knee, the greeny yellowy borders are where I can move the lumps to, and the blue is where the mild swelling has remained.

"Hi,
It's now over two years since I had TKR on my right knee. It has been an absolute nightmare and after demanding to have it removed I was referred to the pain clinic. I was told the pain is from damage to the nerves. I have been given a dose of Duloxetine, which has really improved my walking (magic). However, I am supposed to have this Genicular Nerve Block. I am worried now that it might deaden my knew completely. Has anybody ever had this? I think I just want to keep on with the Duloxetine.

"I saw the Dr today. He x-rayed my knee. I had been told years ago that I was developing arthritis in my knee but today I was told I did not have arthritis. That is a good thing. But, he said I probably have Patellofemoral Syndrome. When I looked it up online, the symptoms do not match up. It does not hurt under the knee cap, it hurt along side the knee cap, interior, lateral. It does not hurt going down the stairs, it hurts going up the stairs and climbing hills. The pain does come and go but mostly I have pain. It doesn't matter if my knee has been bent or not the pain is there. I wake up with pain in the side of my knee. Do you think this is truly Patellofemoral Syndrome? I was thinking I had a problem with ligaments or tendons. Any advice? I start PT next week. He did mention maybe an MRI if PT doesn't help. He said a scope wouldn't help. Thanks.

"Hi I am a 48 year old who has been active all my life, rugby, cricket.cycling etc.
About 18 months I was experiencing sciatic pain and my movement in my left meant I couldn't run. I did all the normal things physio etc but was still getting pain and mechanics of my left leg were not right.
I had a back scan that showed a disc in L5 S1 area was bulging, again, I had physio, traction, dry needles, acupuncture but still my left woudl not work.
In February 2018 I had a disc replacement, sciatic pain went but my left leg still did not work, I could walk but with a limp and had knee pain.
Knee scan showed a bit of arthritis but nothing too bad, had cortisone injection but no change and knee/leg would still not work and cannot run.
I had nerve tests from hip to toe which showed no issue.
So 18 months on I am no further forward.
When I walk I limp, I cannot run on the spot or run full stop. On static cycling machine I have no issues and have proper movement. I am also stumblign and have fallen over on numerous occasions but i do not have dizziness.
I am totally fed up with the whole thing, any advice on what the issue may be?

ROM is still 95 but im happy with that as before the op i feel it was less as i could not bend it at all due to the pain from the arthritis.

"I am 9 weeks post op for TKR. I went for my physical therapy yesterday and during a ROM measurement for bending, I found myself feeling pain on the right side of my new knee. My therapist worked to massage it and said it might be an adhesion or scar tissue. This was not the first time I have had this pain, but it was the first time I could pin point where the pain was coming from. I spent most of the rest of my day, resting my knee and icing it. Whenever I try to push a bend to improve my ROM, I experience this pain and have to stop. I am now able to ride my stationary bike and do full rotations for 10 minutes with a tension setting of 2, but still cant get beyond a 110 ROM without feeling this pain. Has anyone else had this issue and what should I do?

Having benefited from belonging to a forum for breast cancer during my time of treatment, I am now looking for a forum to join whilst experiencing knee surgery.
I am to have a partial/full knee replacement depending on how it looks when they operate. I have been to 'knee school' and have a date this month for my pre assessment but no op date yet. I have recently taken early retirement due to ill health (I also have long-term depression and anxiety) and have too much time to think! My biggest worry at the moment is the spinal anaesthetic- mainly because I have problems with my back and am worried I won't be able to sit still.
I would love to hear from anyone who is going through/been there.

"Hello, just an update of my progress to hopefully encourage others on this tkr journey. I’ve seen much progress. The tightness is nowhere near what it was a few months ago. The incision is  less sensitive and I’m no longer feeling like the surgery was not successful. It’s like everyone said; it takes time to heal. I think my aqua therapy twice a week has really helped a lot. I’m back to dancing and wearing high  heels ( no more than 2.5 inches high) for short periods of time. I still get some swelling if I’m really active but I rest, elevate and ice. Patience and staying active is the key. It does get better. Good luck to everyone.

"Knee is mending as well as can be expected, however i am now 15 weeks post TKR and throughout all off the 15 weeks i have always had pain after carrying out physio exercises (sometimes not a lot of exercises) with the intensity of the pain varying which can last from 1- 3 days. My question is this:-
1. Is the pain due to overdoing the physio exercise
2 Is the pain due to all the tissues, ligaments etc knitting together within the knee
3. A combination of 1. and 2.
At times even although i am in discomfort i try to carry out some physio exercises rather than resting my knee for a few days since i am afraid that if i do not carry out the exercises then my knee will not 100% heal completely.
Would like to hear other people experiences, for example has anyone had a 100% result with carrying out very little physio or just carrying out physio when the knee was pain free i.e. just let the knee heal in its own time. 
Although i know that my knee is healing as well as can be expected i am sooooo frustrated that when i want to push along to get back to my relative active lifestyle i seem to keep hitting  barriers in my recovery i.e. it appears my knee will recover in its own time no matter how much physio i try to do, Although i have been carrying out the physio for 15 weeks i am afraid not to carry out the physio as this may lead to not eventually a successful knee

"I am due to have my TKR this Wednesday. I am considering having a spinal block instead of a general and would be interested in others experiences of this. 
I am very concerned about post surgery pain relief as my previous experiences of morphine and all other opioids has been dreadful. The only pain relief I am able to take is ibuprofen and paracetamol, which hardly seems adequate for this surgery. Anti sickness drugs also don't appear to work. Voltarol gives me stomach cramps so I'm really struggling with what to take. 
The pre op nurse suggested I might be better off with a spinal block, which could be left in and then topped up with pain relief as required. 
I have waited a long time for this surgery under the NHS so am relieved it is finally going ahead, but I'm getting very nervous. 
Any advice would be welcome.

"I am 6 weeks post op and doing ok but lost a bit of range ( which Physio tells me is actually to be expected after initial couple of weeks)  so  having some extra Physio as of yesterday . But I also suddenly started having more swelling and stiffness earlier this week which alarmed me. Not sure why maybe walking more or heat or just the recovery process ups and downs.
Had follow up with surgeon on Tues he is happy with progress, but he wants me to really push myself for next 6 weeks Ro maximise range of movement and build strength. Like lots of people my muscle  de-conditioning before op was quite bad. 
 Anyway - what I wanted to say was that I decided to go try some exercise in the pool at my gym. Just doing my regular knee exercises in the water, a bit of walking laps and followed by a while in the nice hot jacuzzi and steam room. Yum.
 It has really helped - the exercises are  so much easier to do in water ( in fact you have to be careful not to overdo it ) and it really loosened knee up and reduced swelling.
So people might want to ask about hydrotherapy if it’s available  or DIY like me - surgeon and Physio approve by the way might be useful. 
Use pain killers before and after to keep that in check of course  - and ice ice ice !

"Everyone said give it time to feel better. While a year doesn't guarantee a TKR will feel better, it was the magical time when my surgeon said "" I want you to get another opinion bc you're miserable. You should not be in this kind of pain and if I miss something on your xrays or if something is not right, I want to know about it."" Girst time the man talked to me, not st me.
So I got two other opinions. Both of these said;
1. The bottom part that is drilled into your shin is not in correct position.
2. You now have bone spurs on the thigh bone where the upper part is rubbing bc of improper placement.
3. You also have bursitis in shin ( said technical name of area, but I can't remember it)
Has anyone else had this happen? What did you do about it?
They are suggesting draining bursitis area, injecting bone spur area and doing another revision of replacement. My work requires me to be on my feet, walking and flexible. I also ride horses. My work schedule has me committed until the end of Spring right now. Then I have a month's break, unless I pick up more work, but July 1st, I start non stop until November or December.
Do you feel a month will be long enough to get me walking comfortably again? Last revision, I climbedback in the saddle in 9 weeks, really riding in 11. Currently, I probably walk about 5 miles a day, stand for about 7 -10 non consecutive hours, and ride for 1-3. I can't afford to give up my clients and spent the last two years building a nice clientele base. I'll get the surgery eventually. Trying to figure out when is the issue I am facing, but that's my problem.

"Had another person today give his unsolicited opinion that he was amazed that I am still using a crutch 10 weeks post-op TKR.  I can limp around at the house and some at work, but if I go any distance - walking without the crutch really fatigues my leg and causes increased pain. I am walking more and more without the crutch, but my therapist said until I could walk fairly normally - I should still mostly use the crutch. I still feel like I have a tight sleeve around my thigh from about the knee to mid-thigh. ? What say you? I am doing okay?

"I sprained my right knee after landing a martial arts kick improperly 10 months ago and couldn't walk for 2-3 weeks. Since I was naive, I didn't ice it and it swelled a bit - the pain was below the kneecap. After physical therapy, my knee felt much better, but its joint still feels loose, and unstable and I can't put as much weight on it. (I'm a bit suspicious of my treatment since I got no MRIs or diagnoses and was just given the exercises to do after the therapist told me to do a few basic things.)
Yesterday, I landed a kick improperly again due to my right knee instability and heard a cracking sound. It hurt for a few seconds, then I shrugged it off and continued exercising. But this morning, I started to feel a pinch in my lower inner knee whenever I walk. It's swelling a tiny bit. When I tried to do a squat, the knee felt very unstable and kept making a cracking sound. When I straighten it abruptly, it makes that noise too. 
The internet tells me it's an MCL sprain, but I want confirmation on this and would like to know what to do next. Should I stop exercising a bit?
Thank you!

"I have read other posts and am relieved to hear that I am not alone. It was starting to wear on me and I was beginning to feel depressed. I am taking two pain pills before bed (9pm) and that helps a little, but eventually, the pain and stiffness becomes unbearable and by 5am, I have to get up and walk around. I take my next pain pill at 6 or 7am and again at 2 or 3pm. I do my PT, ice and rest in between and am able to do some routine house chores and cooking. I can walk 1/2 mile and can go to store. Still not driving due to pain meds. I feel I am doing good, but am surprised that I still need the pain meds.

"I just wanted to say that chronic pain and fatigue can set off a real depression that cannot be overcome with just positive thinking. Some people - maybe those who already struggle with occasional depression - can be helped tremendously with anti-depressant medications. I would suggest at least talking with your family doctor. Just as your knee needs pain meds temporarily, your brain may need some help - temporarily. I’m not pushing medication for all recovery blues, but I do believe some can’t just think their way happy.... like me.

"First, this is definitely not uncommon...especially in the first 30-60 days which are the absolute worst.  Try some of this...
- OTC Melatonin or Diphenhydramine (cheap, generic Benadryl) an hour before bed.  Make sure you're not allergic first.  The former is available in strengths from 3-10mg.  Start low and increase if necessary.  The latter is the same ingredient in all ""PM""-style products.  Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that makes you drowsy.  Adult dosage is 25-50mg.
- Also an hour before bed, turn off ALL electronics (computer, TV, cell phone, etc.).  Prepare your body for sleep.
- If applicable, take your nighttime meds. 
?
- Prepare the room to be completely dark.  Drapes or blindfold.
- Go to the bathroom and empty your bladder.  This lessens your chance of having to go in the middle of the night.
- Apply some Voltaren Gel (RX in the US).  Best topical anti-inflammatory out there.
- If you are having a problem with incision site sensitivity rubbing against your sheets, wrap the knee loosely with an ACE bandage or slip on a knee sleeve. 
- Read a book for a half hour then lights out.  Great way to let go of the day and become drowsy.
- I enjoy listening to some Native American flute music.  Very calming.
- Get a diffuser and some lavender oil.  Mmmmmmm.....
- Against my doc's recommendation, I elevated and iced for the first month or so.  Your call on this one.
If none of this works, call Warner Brothers and have them send over Wiley Coyote with the giant mallet he tries to use on The Roadrunner...or the 16-ton weight he drops off the cliff, through your roof and onto your head.  Those will definitely work!!!

"Hi
I am now 4 month post op after  Right KTR i was doing so well and feeling positive then las Sunday I slipped on third from the bottom step on my stairs bending my knee all the way back so painful I cried like a baby anyway on Monday I phoned hospital and spoke to orthopaedic Nurse and she had me in on Tuesday for an X-ray she was happy it looks ok which put my mind at rest.  I see consultant end of this month, But I was wondering if anyone else had this happen and did it take long to heal as I assume I has tissue damage it has set me back I feel like I am starting all over again. Feeling so angry with my self as I had been so careful and then this happens but thats life.
Hope you are all doing well and recovering fast.

"I went for an MR scan and xray a few months ago with a view to having another arthroscopy.
The consultant showed me the results and told me another op would be pointless as I'm now bone on bone.
The options were partial knee op, a realignment op or do nothing.
He also said he wouldn't do anything till I'd retired from my job which is a manual one.
What i want to know is how active I'll be after a partial knee op. Im 60 btw.

"Hi
New here. 48 male.
Ive been having pains in my left knee, especially at night for a fair fair few weeks now from what i remember as it came on very slowly. Its a dull ache rather than a sharp pain so its hard to pin point the exact place but i would say its on my upper front knee and radiates up my lower left femur.
I can walk fine, no extra pain moving just this dull ache all the time. If i straighten my leg in bed i can feel its slightly more painful behind my kneecap.
Im not sure if its getting worse or the fact im now aware of it at night but its definitely keeping me awake or if i awake in the night i have trouble getting back to sleep.
I cannot remember hurting my knee at all, certainly no trigger and i dont really do much excercise and im also not overweight.
Ive been taking ibrprofen but its not helped at all.
Im getting a little worried as i would think it should have got a little better by now and im a little young for arthritus and its just the left knee.
I do suffer from anxiety so think i need to make an appointment with my gp but im not sure what to say so he will send me for tests instead of fobbing me off due to my age.
Anyone had a similar problem or can anyone give me some pointers of the best way foreward to get answers.

"It isn't my knee actually. It's around the top left of my knee cap, I can't describe it because I'm unsure of it. Sometimes it feels like the place that connects the muscle to the knee cap hurts, sometime it feels like it's the muscle. I've been stressing out looking around articles to find what exactly is it but I can't find any. The pain has greatly reduced but still are there when I kneel or do single leg stand up, the pain is around the muscle of the top left knee cap on my right knee. It is really close to the knee cap. I doubt it is the tendon because I saw the anatomy of the quad tendon it is right above the knee cap but for my case it is more towards the top left of my right knee. I do not know how I hurt it, I didn't have any major injuries but I play basketball often, maybe it is the reason?

"I've had worsening pain in my left knee for about a year and a half now, and about 4 months ago my doc shceduled me for an MRI. The results showed that I have advanced osteochondritis dissecans with multiple lesions. Apparently there is also a loose body floating around in the joint. The popliteal cyst which rebounds every few years has also come back. Also, the MRI showed that below my knee there is an osteophyte, which is painful to the touch and whenever I bend my knee. So, the OCD makes it painful in the front of the knee, the patella shifts and clicks whenever I even move my leg in any direction, and nothing relieves the pain whatsoever. The cyst is a large painful bump behind my knee which makes it very stiff. Combined with the bone spur I am now unable to fully extend my leg or bend it more than 40 degrees. I do walk every day but have been unable to participate in any other exercises. When I walk my knee is painful, stiff, sometimes locks and feels like it will just come apart any moment. Needless to say, when my doc said that it will require surgery I was not surprised. However, after researching the different methodology for OCD procedures I'm very anxious as to which will work for my situation. To add to this fun mix I'm also worried about the idea of a total joint replacement because I have Type I Diabetes and I do not heal very well. Basically, I'm a mess of anxiety and worry and constant pain and frustration, and totally at my wit's end.

"Has anyone had a 2nd tkr on same knee?, was wondering how it went & if it was successful? I've got problems with my knee I had replaced Feb 2017. It's never fully recovered & has been continually stiff. Earlier this year it started suddenly ballooning up & was extremely painful for no reason that I can think of. After several times of this happening my husband took me to a & e where I was admitted. Had sum fluid withdrawn from my knee to be sent off for testing for poss infection. That came bk negative, I was then sent home to wait for apt for more tests. Had that still nothing, saw consultant again was offered another knee replacement. I refused that so he then sent me for more tests to check deeper for infection. When I went bk to see consultant next time I only saw registrar who told me there was still no infection & said I'd have to see consultant for options. Anyway my knee has been throwing out my back & hip & giving me a lot of pain. I'm due to see consultant at end of month, I think he's going to tell me my only option is to have my knee done again. I'm really worried bout having it done again in case this 1 doesn't go right either. Anyone got any advice?

"7 weeks ago I dislocated my knee whilst running after a ball. The ball bounced a different way whist I was chasing it and as I changed direction my knee dislocated. I had an X-ray and was put in a leg splint for 10days. 
After seeing the consultant I had an MRI as I couldn’t straight leg raise. My consultant then went on holiday leaving the physio to discuss the MRI results. He diagnosed a lateral patellar dislocation said it would 8-12 weeks.  Had 3 weeks painful physio, did exercises very often then resaw the  consultant.......the consultant then informed me that it was a lateral patellar dislocation however I had also ruptured the MPFL and had bad bone bruising none of which I had been told before this. Now told 16-20weeks recovery. 
I’ve now moved to a private physio who can see me 3 times a week however after 2 weeks physio with him ( 5 weeks physio altogether) and 7 weeks since accident my progress is stalling/ none existent. 
I can get my knee nearly at full extension (straight) however my ROM is very small: around 35 actively and 20 passively. 
THE BIT THAT CONFUSES ME AND MY PHYSIO IS THIS...
I can only get the above ROM when lying on my stomach, when sitting or lying on my back I have less than 5 degrees ROM passive and active. We have no idea why it works one way but not the other. I don’t see my consultant for another week but am really worried about my slow progress and what my next steps might be. MUA has been mentioned in passing by physio. The lake of bend is really getting me down I cry a lot and generally feel like my life is falling apart. I was so happy, active and about to move house plus start a new job before this.

No, I have not hone to doctor about it. I dislike my doc. They will probably say rest it. How can I when I need to work?

"This is not a question, just need to vent.  First let me say thank goodness I found this site around 6 weeks after my TKR when I was really feeling depressed about the whole procedure.  I found lots of great advice and ideas for getting through this journey.  
So my TKR was Jan 2018, had an allergic reaction to the glue that they used to close me up which set me back and then at 12 weeks later I had a MUA because my knee wouldn't bend pass 100 with lots of help.  After my MUA I could really see a big improvement in my bend and shortly after that I was finally able to get back to do some serious gym workouts.  
But as Chico Marx's picture of The REALITY of a TKR Recovery...In One Picture so clearly points out, the dips in the road to recovery can be many and some can be deep.  
Found out yesterday that the pain I was having in my left foot (the TKR was on my right knee) is a stress fracture.  Since my bone density is great (at least it was last year when I had a bone scan) the doctors are saying it from an ""off"" gait from before the TKR and then after the TKR while I was trying to get stronger.  
I am now in a ""boot"" and was told to rest it as much as possible for six weeks.  No bike, no swimming, nothing...after that they will take another x-ray and slowly let me start back.  
I have to say I just sat in the doctor's office and cried.  I have been working so hard to get back to ""normal"" after that TKR and now I feel like I am starting over.  
But I keep telling myself this is just a ""dip"" in the road to recovery and I will get though it.  It is not an infection or my knee hasn't failed as I know some of you have gone though.  So it could be worse...

"Hi I was wondering if anyone else has had the same or similar pros as me. Had my tkr in Feb 2017 but swelling has never quite gone down, but ROM is good, no problems bending but still gets stiff. Earlier this year (1st time was new years eve) my knee started swelling up more & getting stiff for no particular reason, then within a few hrs would go bk down again. This happened quite a few times & each time would get worse. It would suddenly balloon up & I'd be in excruciating pain for about half an hour to an hour. Eventually after several episodes of this my husband took me to A&E & Dr's decided to admit me to see consultant. When he saw me he didn't seem to have much idea but decided to get some samples of fluid in swelling on my knee to send off for testing to see if their was any infection. While I was in hospital I had several more bouts of swelling & pain, they put me on morphine which killed the pain. I was discharged after a few days to await an apt for a bone scan & to go back to see consultant after I'd had that done. When I went back to see consultant I was told the samples of fluid they took showed no infection but he wanted me to go for a white cell scan. After all that they still came up with nothing. Consultant then offered to do another knee replacement which I declined for the moment. He then said he'd do keyhole surgery to flush it out & take more samples for testing to check again for infection. This has now come back negative & am now waiting to see consultant again. I've had no more episodes of it ballooning up, I can walk fairly long distances on the flat & go to exercise classes twice a wk but still no further forward. Still stiff & have trouble putting pressure on it to go up & down stairs /hills. I'm worried that all he's going to say is that all he can do is do me another knee replacement. I really don't want this done only as a VERY last resort. Walking is throwing my body out as I'm rolling & getting pain in lower back, hip & upper back. I'm having private massage to help relieve this. Has anyone else suffered similar problems. I'd thought by this time I'd be recovered. I've had my other knee done several yrs ago & that's good. Sorry if this is a bit long winded.

"Had my one yr follow up today. Exactly one yr to the day of my TKR. I am still being told I have tendonitis in that knee, which I truly believe was caused by the physical therspist trying to flatten my knee against the mat by putting all her weight on it and pushing straight down so the back of my knee actually hit the mat.
My calfs are to muscular for thst yo ever happen from riding horses for decades and playing catcher in softball for years. Freaking witch smiled as she did it. My surgeon actually said he wants a second opinion on my knee as I should not be in this amount of pain and hecwants to know if he screwed up somewhere or is missing something. Yay! He is finally listeninhg to me!!
So, has anyone dealt with getting chronic tendonitis after a TKR? What have uou done for it? Did it ever get better? I cant take NSAIDS bc of other medication. I still ice it, do my home exercises, etc.
I told him the pain is actually worse than before my TKR but Im behinning to believe it will never go away.
Any comments or suggestions eould be greatly appreciated.

Now playing  tennis (or try to) twice a week, and running is getting better, not fast but at least I can go for a ball, even jumped for a ball last week.
My friends have noticed that I'm moving better.
I notices middle of this week that my knee seems to be a little more flexible.....
I only need 1 pillow in the bed at night also, I sleep on my right and place my knee against the pillow, not on it...

"I saw the Dr on Thursday ( the 30th ) overall this was a much better visit. Last time I was in tears from the drive from my home to the office approx 20minutes this time yes it still hurts sitting for that long but not as bad. The Dr. was pleased with progress he said that considering the surgeries I had its going to take awhile maybe a year?? before most of the pain goes away and the odds of being pain free are almost nonexistent. That may sound bad but I have been in pain for years if my pain level gets down to a 5 I would be thrilled while some would think a 5 is too much. My biggest issue besides the pain soreness aching etc is walking I have a pronounced limp and that is due to my quad being about like putty ( very weak ) I have to keep pushing. When I walk not around my home but going for a walk have to use a cane hate to use it but do not trust myself w / o it. The Dr. was giving my some statistics based on a study of hip and knee replacements.For hip replacements 90% are glad they had it done 10% no with knee 30% are glad 55% okay but still have pain 15% wish they never had it done. I am in the 55% category. Still have swelling I wake up and feel like I am in my 90's knee is stiff swollen and hurts after moving around it gets better not great but better.

"It’s a stupid story but basically I was away and someone threw a metal keg which smashed off my knee on Saturday.  I was initially in so much pain and I couldn’t even walk and it was so swollen but it did start to get better after a few days. However it’s now getting worse again and I’m struggling to bend it and fully straighten it as well as pain when I walk. There is a kind of swollen lump on the side of my knee cap but I’m worried to go to a doctor in case I’m just wasting their time. The bruise has gone yellow now but there’s still prominent red dots on it. What should I do?

"Seen  Physio this morning had a good workout on the right knee very painful  got it to bend 95  degree but need to get it to 120 I did the  exercises that she asked  me to do from the bike to bouncing on the ball (which makes me laugh ) to doing heal toe on the  trampoline  I also did knee lunging but by then I had enough she was a little concerned that I have swelling and can’t seem to get it down the pain is  not as bad as when I first had the new knee but I just feel it’s not right a lot of numbing which could be the nerve endings knitting back together but I also have a lot of stinging in the knee and pulling at the back of the knee
Also seen the nurse today who was pleased that the abscess hole has now virtually healed with a nice colour to the skin  I see the doctor next Friday by then I’m hoping my pain has gone down from 6 to 0 and if he is pleased with how much I can move bend my knee without pain with luck I can go back to work as it’s driving me mad being stuck at home being Miserable

"Does anyone else have a problem with different bikes. During therapy I used a incumbent bike and it did not hurt my knee at all. So I bought a used one for at home. After riding it for just a couple of days it made my knee hurt so bad that I could barely walk. At first I did not realize it was the bike. I thought I had done something to my knee. So I rested my knee for a couple of days per the PT. Then I tried it again and I realized my knee was beginning to hurt with the bike.   But, go to therapy and can ride that one all day. 
I was discharged from therapy and decided to join a gym.  Well guess what their bikes hurt my knee also. 
Has anyone else had this experience?

"If I rest for a really long time the pain starts to slow down, but as soon as I do more walking(doing house work and other day to day activities) the pain gets bad again. Idk what to do, I feel like I can’t lie in bed all day, my muscles would become too weak and my knees as well. Do you have any advice. Doctor referred me to physiotherapist and I’m still waiting to get an appointment.
Additional information:
-pain on the left and sometimes right side of the knee cap
- doesn’t swell
- burning sensation in knees sometimes 
- tightness 
- no KR for anyone wondering 
- I’ve only had X-ray and blood test which both came back fine
- I’ve not been officially diagnosed, pain has come back over the years every time I tried to squat or do any leg exercises. This time it doesn’t seem to go away like always so it’s probably got more severe

"PKR January 11th.  Full ROM and extension within 6 weeks.  During the recovery have been dealing with plantar fasciitis in opposite foot (now 80% improved and podiatrist has cut me loose with stretching regimen/night splint).  Past month have been having some issues with increasing muscle tightness, mostly calf/hamstring in operated leg. Now experiencing occasional knee pain but it’s mild and not constant at all.  Therapist uses grastin tool and it helps...but not for long.  Stretches feel like heaven.  I’m in Finance, so I sit a lot during the day and sometimes find two hours have gone by and I’ve not gotten up and walked, though I do try to do short arc raises as often as I can during the day.  Beginning to fret just a bit - of course I’ve read all sorts of mess online and am sure it’s terminal, lol!  Input greatly appreciated—anyone with similar experience and what was the outcome/suggestions for improvement.

"To be honest I have no idea how I was chosen to heal quickly. TKR in February. The first few weeks were painful but easily controlled with hydrocodone 1/2 pill twice a day. Only problem was sleeplessness and depression. Off pain meds after 4 weeks except Advil just prior to therapy. That hurt!!! Lots of icing. Pain free since first of April
I go to gym 3x weekly and do more exercises at home on alternate days. Lots of working quads, gluts, etc.  I do a lot of the exercises Chico has listed. They really helped. No return to doctor until next year. Thank you Chico!
I share this to say there is light and it can be done. But it takes a lot of hard work and patience

"Hi I had my left knee tkr March 5th so nearly 6 months ago.  Rom has been stuck at 50 since 5 weeks Post op.  After months of physio, hydrotherapy and acupuncture my surgeon has finally decided to do an MUA ( I have been asking for one for the last 3 months).  I will be in for 48 hours after the MUA on a CPM machine   However it could take weeks to get a date for the procedure as the NHS in my area are in the red.  I spoke to my physiotherapist today and he painted such a horrible picture of the procedure and told me I would be in agony afterwards for a few weeks.  I’m now extremely nervous as I have fibromyalgia and am very sensitive to pain.   Has anyone had an MUA?  What was the recovery like?  I’d welcome your comments.

"Hey Guys,
Experiencing pain in the ligament/tendon that connects the patella to the tibia. The pain is coming from the top of my shin and it only really hurts after exercise and it is localised, only really sore/tender when i press into it. It doesn't hurt walking about, i can still walk about and run and play football/soccer fine but it just doesn't feel right? if that makes sense.
I've attached a link to tumblr where I have uploaded some images to pinpoint where the pain comes from... it says my images are too big in size to upload.
I'm 25, in an office job, played football my whole life, don't really run other than when playing football, used to go to gym a lot but since moving workplace haven't as much past 2/3months. Very frustrating as a similar pain kept my out of football for about a year around 3 years ago, i just stopped playing for a year and it got better.
Any advice? Thoughts? on what it could be and how i could prevent it. I'm going to stretch a lot over the next couple weeks, plenty ice and rest from running/football for 2/3weeks and see how it is but if anyone else has ever experienced anything similar i'd appreciate some feedback.
Thanks,
Mikey

"Well - I've had a big shock today and now know why I've been in such pain with no improvement in my lateral movement etc....an MRI has revealed the bone cement had leaked and attached itself to my knee cap ! I am told it is very rare as it usually sets fairly quickly - while on the operating table....just my luck that something has gone wrong here......NOW I need to have scar opened and the cement hacked off and flushed out somehow. I just hope the recovery is not as long as the full job but if they can't get all the cement out (which may impede the new joint function) they may need to re-do the implant!  In addition, during the operation they seem to have fractured my vertebrae - I already have a number of spine issues in L4/5 facet joints, disc removal. a denervation and now this L1 collapse! The irony of this is the vertebrae repair is a balloon inserted and filled with.....BONE CEMENT ! Ha!  Anyone experienced or heard anything like this? I feel truly deflated today after struggling for so long with this recovery.....which was never going to happen and give me a full range of movement while it was stuck like this....ho hum....x

"No, not THAT PTSD, although it could apply considering the ""trauma"" of having your knee replaced is considerable.
This is PTSD of a more positive variety designed especially for not only the ""Kneebies"" among us but for all TKR patients. As you know by now, I do these posts because I get tired of writing the same words over and over again. There comes a time when I type that one extra character, fall off the cliff and end up in a heap writing another BIG post. So here's my humble offering on our version of PTSD: 
Patience, Time, Strength, and Determination
PATIENCE
When we first come home, we're all faced with the question of how long this pain is going to last and how soon will we be ""normal"" again. Let's get the ""normal"" part out of the way first. You will NEVER be your old ""normal"" self ever again. You now have a 2+ pound mechanical device implanted in your body. That's not normal...except for a robot. You will never be able to play competitive sports, do a slalom ski run at 60 mph or even just plain run. Anything involving knee impact or twisting motions is verboten! (Check my other post on acceptable/forbidden activities.) My hip doc told me years ago that I could have a hip that lasted 25 years or go back to playing hockey and having it last only three. Your choice...except that having it done a second time is NEVER as good as the first...never as tight...never as strong.
Back to patience. We live in a world where the value of patience is completely discarded as we demand whatever we want NOW!  There's an old book entitled ""The McDonaldization of America"" which speaks eloquently to this point.  We want our food fast and healing faster. For us, patience cannot be a virtue...it must be a necessity. We cannot speed up a healing process that takes a long while to complete, no matter what we say, want or wish.  In other words, getting past a TKR is something mostly out of our control. Yes, we can do our PT and exercises without which we'd never get better; but the rest is not something we have any say over. Therefore, patience with the healing process is an absolute requirement for us to get past this.  Just like those car rides with our parents when we were kids (""Daddy, when will we get there?""  ""When we get there!""), be more Zen: ""I'll be better when I'm better.""  
TIME
Lockstep with patience is time.  If you haven't noticed already, a TKR recovery is not measured in days or weeks but in many months, up to 18 or more in some cases. (Check my other post on The TKR Bell Curve.) If you think you'll be on your feet in a day or two, you're CORRECT! You have to be!  The best thing you can do is walk and exercise. However, if you think you'll be back to work in a month, you are flat out delusional. What else is there to say? Except for the extreme, rare cases, this is just not going to happen because a TKR recovery takes a lot of time.  At the beginning of mine, I slept an awful lot...actually, unconscious would be a better description. When I asked my GP why I was sleeping so much, she responded: ""All the healing energy of your body is being directed to your knee.""  
Expenditure of energy can lead to exhaustion and sleep. That's what's happening to your body too. You have to be prepared to give your body time to heal and recover.  We all know that you cannot push a knee...when you do, it slaps you back by swelling up, getting hot, causing pain, etc. Don't do that! Listen to your body...do your exercise work but give yourself time to heal. Don't push to drive again especially if you're still on opioids (absolute no-no) or don't have the motion/strength to depress a clutch. Very dangerous. And don't rush back to work. There's no way a nurse can run the halls, a construction or factory worker can bend and lift, or even a desk-jockey sit there for eight hours without pain and swelling.  Most people return to work around six months, some faster and a few slower. Give yourself the time to heal before resuming your life.
STRENGTH
This one involves three things, specifically, mind, body and spirit. Regardless of how your body feels, your mind has to be strong. Any depressive thoughts should be dealt with and discarded immediately. Post-Operative Depression is a real thing for people that have body parts replaced. The docs never talk about it so be prepared for those crying jags 10 days post-op. Know what it is and discard it. Any feelings of depression down the road are usually caused by having unrealistic expectations about your recovery, like ""Oh poor me...I should be doing better by this time..."". Bullpucky!!! Just a bunch of Jedi mind tricks you're playing on yourself. STOP DOING THAT! Focus your mind on the positive; distract it with other things like reading a good book, being with friends or killing zombies on XBox. Strong mind...do it!
Your body also needs to be strong. PT only gives you your range of motion back; it does nothing for your atrophied quads, glutes and core. After PT, you MUST do the gym (or home) gym work to regain your physical strength. This is the only way you're going to climb stairs unaided again or walk without a cane for the rest of your life. If you can't get to a gym, get a set of resistance bands and use them. Also: Eat healthy, lose weight (if necessary). hydrate a lot, eliminate artificial sweeteners and processed foods, eat good protein. You have to rebuild all the leg and hip muscles that will support your new knee.  
To get all this done, you'll need to look inside yourself and find your peaceful center. It's the place you need to go when you're all alone, times are tough and things might not be going as you thought they would. Pray, meditate, practice yoga, read from your favorite spiritual books or other resources. Do whatever you normally do to find some peace in your life.  Concentrate on bringing that healing, spiritual energy into your body.  Do not discount this source of strength...it is very important.
DETERMINATION
This is where you get to kick some serious a$$... This is all about motivation and focus. The hard part is that it all has to come from inside of YOU. Yes, there are great posters, books, t-shirts, coffee mugs and more that can provide inspiration but it really all starts and ends with you. The easy part is Physical Therapy, really.  Do you actually think you'd go back to your surgeon for your six-week alignment check and tell him that you skipped all your therapy sessions?  We all know that's not going to happen.  You have to break down the scar tissue that's forming or you'll never walk correctly again.  That's a pretty powerful incentive.  It's what comes AFTER PT that will make all the difference.
The only way to get your strength back is by exercising your quads, glutes and core that have atrophied over these past many months. You'll look down at your leg and see a toothpick where there once was a strong quadriceps muscle. Gotta fix that...and the only way is to get out of your chair and do the work. (See my post on Post-TKR Exercises, designed for us by a pro.) And the only way to get out of your chair is to make the determination that exercise will now be a part of your daily like. I won't be something you do occasionally or when you ""feel like it""...instead, it will be part of your SCHEDULED daily activities. You have to keep your focus on getting stronger and not give into depressive thoughts and actions. See yourself better then MAKE yourself better!  My mentor for my master's degree had an old IBM punch card on his office corkboard containing five simple words that have guided me since I met him in 1971.  Those words: ""NO EXCUSES. DO THE WORK.""  Determine to do the work necessary to get well again...no mind games...do the work!
CONCLUSION
Just my thoughts on a lot of topics and questions that keep getting asked over and over again. Just an old guy musing about the past year trying to recover from what everyone calls the most ""brutal"" of all surgeries...and I concur. It can be life changing in many ways, not just the physical. You can really find parts of you that you never knew existed or had forgotten about for a long time. Recovering from a TKR is an OPPORTUNITY to find strengths that you never knew you had and make you a better person for it. Or...you can wimp your way through it...your choice.

It was feeling better a week or two ago - this is new and I am a bit stiffer and having pain again. I have not taken anything in weeks, not even a tylenol and now this burning is quite painful. Am I going backwards? Perhaps I need to ice again more regularly - didn't seem necessary for awhile. What are the stages of healing - the info I have is very vague...

"Hi , I have been struggling to persuade my GP that something was wrong with my knees. When GP has booked for an X-ray after 3 months and 6 visits , I decided to have private MRI and specialist ortho consultation. Chondropatio patellae  st1-2                             ( chondromalcia)
Of course private doctor advised for bilateral arthroscopy. It always help when I rest but soon after I start walking there is unbearable pain . I am working 12 hrs shift and can’t imagine my life anymore. 
I enjoyed skiing, running, weightlifting, forever walking. Nothing that I can do now.  
I would be interested if anyone had this for number of years and how quickly can chondromslacia progress from st 1-2 to stage 4?  Had anyone had arthroscopy done and what have you had done during procedure?
Anyone heard about regenerative treatment? Did it work?

"Hi, I'm currently on a backpacking travel, and I'm having constant knee pains.
Several things happened during my trip that make it hard to understand what exactly is the cause:
1. A week before my knee started hurting, I hit my knee in a wall.
I had pains for about 3 days, when they passed, I ran 5 kilometers and had to stop due to pains.
2. On the hike, at first, I didn't feel any pains, until at some point I overstepped a step, resulting in extending my knee over its limit, and again, I had pains but they were gone after a day.
3. A day later, after going up some serious amount of stairs, and then going them down, my knee started hurting, the pain became more serious, to the point that the day after i barely able to finish the hike.
Since then, pains come and go, pretty randomly.
I do rope skipping and don't have pains at all, when I run sometimes feel pains, and when I walk, I usually do feel pains after a few kilometers hiking uphill or downhill.
Before I backpacked, I used to run half marathons, train at the gym and so. Furthermore, it is not my first backpacking, and I have never had knee issues.

"Had my 2nd Outpatient PT today. Took 1 pill before going ( really glad I did !!! ) Not on a bike yet but on machine where you sit push your legs forward and back for 5 minutes not too bad. Did some stretching Therapist checked my ROM 131Degrees on my own no straining last week 125. All that is great however still have my share of pain but now down to 2 pain pills a day. I think my biggest problem my quads are just super weak. When I walk I have to be careful otherwise L knee will just decide to give out which causes me to stumble. Trying to do a straight leg raise so far is a joke as well as putting a bolster under the knee tighten my quad and try and lift my foot off the mat not even close to getting it off the mat my quad tightens but that is it.

"hello all - a google search led me here. I am scheduled for a total knee (right) on Monday. A bit of background. i'm 60 y/o male, of average weight. long history of right knee issues. two scopes for torn medial meniscus -1st in '94, 2nd maybe 10 years ago or so. last 3 years knee starting 'locking'.  i'd take a step or two and it'd 'unlock'.  i had supartz on 3 occasions over the past 3 years.  first two series (a year apart) worked.  last series this past spring did not work. ""locking"" occurs more frequently and it doesn't ""unlock"" as readily.  that's when it's most painful.  not too much pain at rest, but walking, going down stairs is difficult.  i limp when walking.  saw two surgeons, both recommended knee replacement (one partial, the other total). i'm scheduled for the total.  here's the problem. i have a trip to spain and morocco scheduled for 8 weeks later.  a bit more background. this will be my 15 or 16th surgery - 5 back, 4 shoulder (2 & 2), 3 knee (one left). cervical fusion, broken finger and i've bounced back from all. for example, I had a microdisectomy in 2017 and was only missed 3 weeks of playing hockey.  My physiatrist and PT both said i'm the most resilient patient they've ever seen. i'm not bragging just providing context, but this has me shaken. i've been depressed and i think it is mostly because i haven't been able to convince myself that this is what i need to do. plus the trip looms over it all. with previous surgeries it was a day of two of ""whoa is me"" followed by ""F this - let's get this going cause i got to get back to my life!""  I still play hockey 3x week - granted i'm not any good anymore, but i still get out there!   my surgeon says i will be fine for spain and that he finds the ""magic"" number is typically 6 weeks, that his patients turn the corner at that time.  anyway - i guess my question is - do you think it is possible for me to go on a two week holiday with a lot of walking daily, 8 weeks post TKR??  thank you all in advance for your help and sharing your experiences!!

"I hope I get some replies because I feel like I’m losing my mind. One year ago I had my right knee replaced. I’ve seen the surgeon for a yearly check up. He tells me X-rays are beautiful and knee looks and feels perfect. GP looks at it, says the same.  I have made arrangements to have left knee done in October since it is bone on bone and really hurting me. Am I crazy or what. Right knee still hurts. It is stiff and hurts me. It’s hard to walk on it. It hurts every morning. I still have to take a pain killer. Some say it’s because of the left knee some say it just takes time. The pain is right in the knee itself. Any ideas? Also I went on a site called bone smart and they said after awhile you don’t have to do the PT every day so I stopped, Dr said you should do it forever. VERY confused

"I'm 8 weeks post tkr on right, left 1.5 yrs ago. Been doing PT 2X week and started back at my gym last week. I did a good workout for my knee at the gym yesterday (PT stuff) for a good 40 min., put a lot of effort into it. Was sore this morning, then sat at a movie for an hour and 45 min. Literally could barely get up after the movie! Did I overdo the exercise? Is it just part of rehab? Maybe I should have left my seat at movie now and then? Still hurting. Thoughts?

"I had a TKR on the right leg on July of last year 2017. Since then I have 7 infections on my right calf , CELLULITIS,  my leg now resembles a side of corned beef, (yuk), my leg and knee are still swollen although not as bad as just after the operation. At one time my knee actually saw/felt some improvement with exercises and ice for the swelling but in the past 4 weeks the pain has returned with a vengeance . I have trouble with my left knee and am waiting for a referral with the MSK clinic, with the pain from my left knee and excruciating pain from my new knee after the TKR it gets very painful getting up from a sitting position I have to grab items of furniture to help me stand up as its so painful. I just keep being told to give it time it can take up to 18 months to recover from the op, i'm a man in his early 60's and was off work since my operation I say was as I have now lost my job due to ill health as my employers put it.

"had tkr 14 weeks ago and have had a terrible 3 months from a very bad bleed after 10 days to then not being allowed to do exercises so only had 30 degrees flex and had a MUA 4 weeks ago followed by virtually daily Physio.
anyway 8 days ago I managed for the first time to be able to have my leg in a sitting position all day without having to rest it at all, this allowed me to move my knee every few minutes, do extra slides or more exercises with an ankle weight and a Physio bolster..
i didnt realise until the day after how much more I had done, spent next couple of days doing hydro therapy at local pool and pushed hard on with exercises. 
Saw private Physio after 4 days and he was really surprised at how far I had moved on and when I saw nhs Physio the next day she said “great now let’s get you walking properly “ and I spent 90 minutes doing a stream of exercises just based on me walking with confidence and using stairs properly.
I just wanted to bring a positive post instead of the negative previous posts I’ve made. Am I fixed? No but finally I can see that maybe in 6 months time I’ll be in a much happier place.
Am I pain free - definitely not and in fact a Dr friend suggested I get my medication changed to help with sleeping.
so whilst not everything is rosy, I can see in the far distance something that I believe may be a ray of hope
thanks for reading and keep up with the exercises

"7 weeks on seen  registrar yesterday who said the knee will take up to 6 months to heal why on earth did they say six weeks .  My physio said that the fluid needed draining off but he disagreed and said it would go in time .   Today I have started to use ginger essential oil as apparently that helps with pain and XS fluid the smell is awful but I have to say that so far the pain has been a little better  I exercise as much as I can but I also rely on my pain medication . As I have said before I should be having my left knee done that after this experience I am afraid I am going to have to put it off because I can’t face going through it again but not only that I have my husband ill and he is due for a major stomach green construction due to ulcerated colitis.  So let’s keep fighting people let’s all keep positive and stay strong we will win at the end of the day .

"I had my TKR 1 year ago this coming September. I feel like I am almost worse now then before the surgery. The bone on bone pain is gone but I have a large amount of swelling around the knee, a lipoma on the right side of the knee, and the pain is so intense on some days that I don't want to move. I also suffer from chronic pain throughout my body that has gotten significantly worse since the surgery. I feel like I've been hit by a mac truck every morning when I wake up. I'm currently seeing a rheumatologist to find out the cause of this but in the mean time I need help with my knee. I went for a second opinion at the beginning of the summer and was told the same answer ""Give it a year "" and ""The implant looks great"" but something is definitely wrong. I can't bend it much and now straightening it hurts. It seems to be getting worse not better. Oh, and I also had a manipulation done 7 weeks after the surgery. HELP!!!

"I sincerely hope no one here goes thru the B/S I have been thru with my knee. Yes I am well aware of how a knee replacement hurts believe me it sucks but for those that think this is the worst they have ever felt sorry to inform you your wrong have as many surgeries as I have had I would bet money that once you experience your 6th revision you will almost wish for the pain you had with your first its no joke!!! I am presently at 7 weeks 2 days since my 6th revision pain wise yes its better then when I first got home. At first I was taking 2 4mg tablets of Dilaudid every 4-6 hours ( 6 a day ) for pain now on average its 3 sometimes 2. You would think based on that its not hurting as bad well I can assure you it still hurts like hell. I kind of feel like its one of 2 things going on since I am taking less pain meds, 1- it could be I am getting use to the pain or 2 it could be its a tad better well okay 3rd option maybe a combination of both. Started outpatient Therapy yesterday some good news ROM 125 degrees with no help ( that is with bad knee ) good knee a little over 130. Now the blah after I was done had to do just a few things once I got home 10am by 1pm misery yet again I had to lay down for a few hours pain wise it stunk. For those that have trouble sleeping I am with you on that I would love to get a good nights sleep every night same thing toss and turn try using a pillow to help keep knee comfortable its very hard. Here it is almost 8 am east coast US. Yet again knee swollen and tender if I were to compare surgeries this by far has been the most painful time wise I would guess based on how I feel a good 3 to 4 weeks behind that last revision. Hope this all makes sense I really thought #6 was going to like the last 5 well I was wrong hopefully given time it will get there since now it stinks.

"It's been a little while since I've been on here. I still read the posts that people make on here.
Had my 1 year check up last week. The Doctor was pleased with my bend and check up. I told him that I was still having a weak muscle at the top of knee. He said that that muscle they slice open to get to the knee operation that is why it's weak. He showed me a couple if exercises to do for that He said it might take up too 1 1/2 years to recover.
He watched me walk and said I have more ROM in my operated knee than my good knee seem stiff. Ironic.
In the past year wasn't easy. Pain wise and learning what you can do and then what activities you have to modify.
Guess can't complain to much pretty much got my lifestyles back.
I can go up and down my stairs without a problem. I can kneel if I have to. Can walk and ride a bicycle without any problem. I haven't iced my knee in about 7 months.
About only problem is getting out if bed in mornings. I wouldn't call my knee stiff just little tender. Now if I go for long car ride of course I'm stiff.
Standing for long knee muscle hurts. But then I sit and after a few minutes I'm fine.
At least the bone on bone pain is gone! Just have muscle pain.
I will never have this done again.

"Hi, I've been suffering with heart palpitations and fatigue for about 5 years now. 
I had knee swelling not that long ago, went to GP and was told it may just be wear and tear as she felt clicking. Looked it up to find she meant arthritis. I'm worried as I am only 25 and don't want to be limited to what I can and can't do. Unfortunately Arthritis runs on my dads side of the family. Also My nans side have died from heart Attack. 
These are the symptoms I am currently Experiencing: Knee pain in right knee while walking (Coming somewhere in the front somewhere) Slight left knee pain. 
Clicking when straightening my legs but not bending.
Slight tingling in my leg towards the ends of my foot/toes. 
Heart palps (Can't even walk to the loo without them starting but stop when lying or resting) 
Twitching around my body and above my right eye (That's been happening for a few days) I also have IBS and maybe GERD and have been given Zentiva by my GP. 
My IBS only plays up in the morning but can make me feel tired throughout the day.
I Believe my body works Quickly as it does not digest Food probably as I get diarrhea.  
Bad Fatigue (Feeling of extreme tiredness) I normally get this often.
I would really like some advice as to what this could be ? I'm was hoping maybe I've hit my legs while asleep as I have a wooden bar running across my wall. 
I've been on birth control for 8 Years, 5 years on the pill and 3 on the Coil. And I've heard this can give you heart palps and Tiredness plus a lot more due to the hormones. 
My heart palps don't happen all the time and sometimes there will be a break for a month. They can last anywhere from a few days to months. 
Funny enough I only got some fluttering during a 2 week holiday, but that's when My leg started swell towards the end. 
I'm not sure if I may have rested it on my PC as it's right under the desk in front of me, but can this cause swelling and Clicking when straightening my leg ?
I do Suffer with Anxiety and stress living in London is very stressful and the place I work.
Currently I don't feel that great just tired all the time and don't feel like doing much. And i would love to get up and feel great and work out but I just can't. 
I have a X-ray to attend and a blood Text tomorrow but its waiting for results.
I am very scared at this point and worried something may happen to me. 
I'm attaching a photo of my knee, it looks bruised but it's just the lighting. 
Thanks for any help and advice.

"One thing is for sure no matter how many times you have your knee replaced it never gets any easier nor does the pain get any less, I think the opposite is true. Each time you have surgery on the same knee its a little bit more involved then the last each time the pain is a little more intense and no it does not make the recovery any less it just adds. Today I have done just about nothing walked around the house pulled a few weeds turned on the sprinkler ( it is very hot in Va Here in Richmond Va the highs are pushing 105  so I was not out long minutes as in 10? Now I am laying on my sofa and saying I am miserable is putting it mildly and what stinks the only thing that gets easier with each revision is you know beyond a shadow of a doubt for a good while every day is going to hurt some worse then others you go to bed in pain you do not sleep well due to pain you wake up in pain when the therapist comes it is going to be more pain. Yes hopefully in the end it will be worth it for the majority of everyone it will be for me its the unknown I hope so but there are no guarantees.

"Apologies if this isn't the right forum. Just wanted to see if others have gone through the experience I am at the moment. Or others might be able to offer thoughts and advice.
I am/was awaiting surgery for knee arthroscopy to fix a medial tear and to remove a medial cyst. Gone threw all the normal procedures to date over the past year, GP appointments, Xrays, MRI and lastly a Pre Op & at no point did my local health trust let me know any negative around this type of Op. Considering its after the Pre-Op I received a letter last week informing me funding has been declined for the op. I am appealing the decision as even though for a medial tear funding isn't available a medial cyst is. Morally and possibly ethically I feel the decision is unjust as certainly this information should of been informed to me sooner in the whole process and especially not after the Pre Op stage .
Not sure if this forum is UK based or worldwide but I would be interested to hear others take on this especially anyone UK based and had experiences like this with the NHS.
For the record not bashing the NHS they do a fantastic job but on this occasion I do feel slightly let down by the way things have gone......cheers

"Lets start from the beginning. 
1 year and 3 months ago I torn my meniscus in my right knee. I was not able to get surgery until 6 months after the incident. so for 6 months I was limping and lost some muscle mass on my right side and gained more on my left. 
Once the surgery was finished I felt great and for about a week I was able to walk normal again but once I start leveling my self out with walking correctly I developed Sciatica on my right side and my right foot started hurting alot as well. 4 months of chiropractor visits helped alot with the sciatica issues but then all of a suddent my LEFT knee started to swell. I saw an orthopedic and we did and MRI and it showed nothing was wrong just alot of water on the knee which could be from over working the left knee so he prescribed me Meloxicam for inflammation but it just got worse.
My right Foot continued to hurt and my left knee swelling never went down. Then I developed Carpal tunnel in my Right hand. 
I did several blood panal exams, Xrays, MRIs .... All showed nothing in the foot or knee. no arthritis, no gout, no diabetes , normal levels of almost everything. Fast forward to the future. 
NOW: BOTH knees are swollen, they dont hurt they are just swollen and i cant bend them or put alot of pressure on them . I see a podiatrist for my foot who thinks I have really bad tendinitis in the foot after applying my normal body weight back on it after surgery since I was not putting wait on it for 6 months. 
So the main issues are the knees. I do have muscle loss in my legs from not being able to walk correctly for a year so I was thinking maybe the water build up is caused by too much stress on the knees. since the MRI and Xrays and blood tests show nothing wrong. 
I have spent weeks icing, elevating them and compression and nothing is working. 
What do it do? 
What are your professional thoughts.

"I'm a skateboarder of more than a decade, and falling down onto the pavement comes with the territory. Usually my tumbles just involve scrapes and minor bruising of the bone.
Recently, however, I fell off and landed directly on my left knee, kind of landing on the side facing outwards. The pain in the moment was pretty intense, but it subsided after maybe 10 minutes and I continued skating. Afterwards, it hurt when touched or had pressure on it for maybe a week or less.
Now, the area is painless but there remains a relatively large bony bump protruding from it. My patella itself seems to be in place. I'm wondering if I dislocated something and if this kind of thing typically subsides. If not, what are the consequences of leaving this untreated?
I'm attaching a photo (I think). Any help in identifying this is much appreciated. Thanks.

"So some background, I was in a motorcycle accident the beginning of last month have a left tibial plateau fracture, right femur fracture, and 2 lower spine fractures. The doctors put a plate and screws in my hip for the femur fracture and gave me a brace for my back. They somehow overlooked the knee fracture, and had me doing physical therapy on my broken left knee for nearly two weeks.
They finally rechecked my knee and told me they would need to put a plate and screws to fix the tibial plateau fracture. After my surgery they said the bone fragments were pushed down (from the therapy probably) and I needed some bone graphing as well. Anyways, now it's all fixed and it's been nearly two weeks since my surgery.
The problem I'm having is that whenever I'm out of bed and sitting up, like in a wheelchair or whatever, my knee will start to ache and eventually turn into excruciating pain until I get back to bed. I tried to elevate it, and stretch it out while in the wheelchair (it has leg rests) but it can never get comfortable. I feel like at this point the pain should be getting better and I should be able to sit in the wheelchair for awhile without the pain becoming overwhelming. Does it take a long time to recover from a surgery like this? The doctors say it's normal, but I'm just not sure...

"Background:
Around 12 years ago I ruptured my patella tendon and suffered some nerve damage as a result of the surgery in my quad.
Fast forward to now and everything is going well even though I still don't have all of the muscle back. My issue is stiffness/pain on the outside of the knee when I try and stretch my quad by pulling my foot to my butt or sitting on both legs (which I can't really do).
It doesn't bother me unless I stretch it but it really impacts my flexibility when weightlifting and playing sports. I'm not sure if this is an tightness issue that needs to be stretched more which causes discomfort/pain or maybe arthritis. Any information/links to stretches or therapy would be greatly appreciated!!!

"I'm just wondering if anyone has or is experiencing this: Had TKR on Feb 5, 2018 and MUA on May 4, 2018. My knee was allegedly custom made to fit me (Conformis  brand). Had almost 5 months of outpatient physical therapy and my range of motion at the end of therapy was between 119 and 124. I continue to do exercises at home most days, riding a stationary bike and doing stair exercise and band stretches. My knee seems to be healing slowly. I am a borderline diabetic (under control) on oral medication. Some days it seems like I can really feel the implant when I walk. Its stiff stiff and sore to the point I take 2 Aleve or 2 Tylenol for Arthritis. This helps a bit but Narco helped better. I don't take Narco any longer. I've used the CPM machine ( twice) and also a TENS unit. The TENS unit may or may not have helped !.  My OS recently gave me a special cream (made by a Biomed pharmacy) containing Diclofenac sodium, Gabapenyin, Lidocaine, and Prilocaine in a cream form to rub on my knee 3 times daily. This cream thus far hasn't relieved the pain but only made my incision and the skin on my knee tender & sore, so I don't use it. I know its still quite early in the recovery process but it just feels like I can feel the metal in my implant or like a foreign object is squeezing my flesh inside my knee. Its stiff and uncomfortable most days unless I take pain meds. I  can go up and down stairs. Its easier to go up than down. Most of the time I  go one step at at time going down. I must say my pain is no where near what it was before surgery. I'm beginning to think this is as good as its going to get. My physical therapist said whatever range of motion you have at 6 months, give or take a few degrees, is about what you will have period so I was also wondering if this uncomfortable feeling of stiffness, squeezing and tightness and slight swelling will ever go away or if my diabetes might make my healing process slower. I haven't given up hope and I know everyone heals differently but I hear people report they didn't need any pain  meds after 5 months, etc. I've had X-ray after surgery and my OS says my implant looks good after I questioned whether or not my implant was the correct size for my knee.

"I’ve had this problem for years that every time I try to do leg exercises like squats or leg extensions, I get knee pain that usually gets better and eventually disappears with rest in like 2 or 3 weeks. 
So it happened again. 3 weeks ago I tried some dance movements that involved squatting and the knee pain reappeared. I had to go to work for 2 more weeks before I could take time off. This is my second day often now until the 14th of aug. 
While I was still at work my knees didn’t bother me too much as the last time it happened, but my calf muscles started to hurt quite bad I thought I had shin splints as well at some point but I’m not so sure anymore, I think it was always just my mucles. I’ve had some pain in my quads and hamstrings as well and pain in my feet that won’t go away with rest. I also feel a tingling sensation from my calves to my feet. I’ve had some pain in my glutes as well which made me think of sciatica. 
Maybe not not taking time off from work(I work at McDonald’s) when the pain started caused nerve damage...? I’m worried to the point I feel sick.
I have an appointment on the 10th and I really hope they will send me for an MRI. X-ray is just useless. 
I’ve been resting for 2 days now and my leg muscles just feel tight or like they are about to lock when I get up from bed. I also feel some pain in my calves when I lie down so idk if it’s because there’s nerve damage and just about anything touching them makes them hurt.
I am a female, 22, 5’1 and 100 lbs and not a fit person.
If anyone wants to chat pls pm me, I really feel like I need to talk to someone when I feel this scared.

"I am in desperate help of some advice. Don't seem to be getting anywhere with any doctors. I will.try to sum this up.....June of 2017 I was diagnosed with Lyme disease. It mainly effected my knees and jaw. Was put on iv treatment and oral. 3 months later Lyme is negative but my body is going crazy. Anyways, I was going twice a week to have my knees drained. Orthopedic surgeon finally told me he couldn't drain them anymore because he was doing more harm than good. In November I was admitted into hospital from huge knees and not being able to lift my hips or thighs. I was wheelchair bound. I'm 34 years old. Fast forward to last week... FINALLY got MRI of both knees. It showed of course large effusions in both, sprains to different ligaments and muscles, degeneration of acl, kneecaps have repositioned and some small bakers cyst. But in the MRI report it also stated that a lytuc lesion and fracture to my distal femur was seen and the radiologist recommended to my doctor to have dedicated MRI of my femur. Well my doctor didn't know I had already picked up the report so when I called to get results, the medical assistant said the only thing on there was that I had fluid and my doctor would be referring me to have it drained and biopsied.....ummmmm......nooooo.....that was not the only thing on there......my question is this.....am I over reacting?? Are the other findings just no concern? I'm not sure if I should call her out on it or not??

"Good evening to all the wonderful people on this forum! I had my Ltkr 5 weeks ago and everything is going pretty well! A couple days ago my lower back or hips(it’s hard to tell which) started feeling tight and hurting! I can’t stand for very long! Is there anything I can do or not do to help this out? I’m sure it’s from the muscles I’m using again! Any advice would be appreciated!

"As many of you know already on this site, I had TKR on my right knee(RIPknee)over two years ago and it’s been an absolute nightmare from pain, losing my balance and walking like a drunk (sorry drunks).
However, for the last year I’ve been plaqued with a recurring urine infection.
I have noticed though when I’m prescribed trimethoprim 200mg - the pain in my knee subsides- any ideas on this. Is the prosthetic seen as a foreign object? Or am I talking rubbish??

"hi All,
had my mua 9 days ago and as usual it’s been a roller coaster since then. Consultant got 100 degree after mua, spent 11 hours on cpm machine at 90 degree. On leaving hospital was probably 60% under own steam. Day 2 had Physio and got to 70 degree followed by day 3 after Physio got to 79 degree. Great I’m going in right direction.
day 4 no Physio and followed given exercises same on day 5. However on day 5 in later in the day knee went really stiff and swollen and could barely get 10 degrees rest of day and early next morning.
day 6 saw Physio really early explained situation and he massaged knee and eventually got to 40 degree but quickly lost it and feared it was another bleed internally. Saw consultant that evening and he examined my knee and was sure that bleed was problem, it was more likely to be soft tissue damage.
Day 7 had Physio massage, no real help but in evening a friend of my wife called in to show my wife how to massage knee and all leg as it would help in long run. She looked at my knee and forced it back as far as it was humane to do and then massaged top of leg and below knee. It hurt unbelievably but freed up something and I’m now back at 60/70 degree.
My insurers recommended Physio is now getting me deep tissue massages for all the leg as everything is so incredibly tight.
sorry this is so long, what I want to get to grips with is to understand what they are massaging and what else it is connected to..
does anyone know if there’s a 3D App showing this

"Instead of all doom and gloom some signs of improvement. Today was my last day of inhome PT and I decided to push it instead of a short walk using my crutch the therapist and I walked 1 mile well I did did it hurt absolutely will I do it again anytime soon ? NO WAY!!! Instead of using 2 crutches now I use mostly 1 or my cane. Still have constant pain but I have noticed I am also getting sharp pains in my knee which I believe is coming from increased activity. Pain wise instead of a strong solid 7 I will give it a high 6 low 7 which is better not great but better. I am also doing okay with taking less pain meds at first it was 2 every 4-6 hours ( dilaudid 4mg ) for a total of 6 per day now I am at 3 tried only taking 2 another dumb mistake on my part. Thats when I posted the Rough Night. Still have a long way to go but the PICC line comes out the 2nd start out patient PT on the 8th.

First week and I was on a high thinking 'what's all the fuss about?' but then the sleepless nights, mood swings and pain tell you otherwise.
Guess I'm just feeling a bit sorry for myself after a rough night and appreciate I've had it simple with just one tkr that went fine.
I'll look for light at the end of the tunnel and hopefully look back and realise it was all worth it.

"Hi I had my left knee tkr 20 weeks ago and can still only get a rom of 50.  I saw my surgeon today hoping he would do an MUA however he said he wanted me to go for a second opinion as I have lymphodema in my legs and he thought an MUA would be counterproductive. He also mentioned Fibrosis and then disappeared before I could ask him for an explanation.   The nurse said it would be a couple of months before I get to see the specialist and it might even mean having to have a revision.  Has anyone else experienced similar? I feel so frustrated as my knee is still 10 times worse than it was before the surgery.  And the thought of going through all that again leaves me cold.  I’d welcome any insights or advice.

At 5 weeks I had physio had 0/100 range which she was pleased with and asked how I was.
I told her I wasn't sleeping well and waking at 3am every night, lost my appetite and lost 3/4 of a stone and mood a little low, she said I looked pale and advised me to see GP for blood tests to make sure all way OK.
Booked in with GP but saw a new doctor, explained everything and without and tests said I was probably already addicted to Tramadol!!
He prescribed one 10mg of Amitriptyline which I'd never had before.... Never again!
Had one tablet at night and woke 16 hours later and felt like a zombie and not touched them since.
Seeing consultant in 4 days for 6 weeks check up and will get his advise.
Just want to sleep and keep pain under control and worried about taking Tramadol as well now.

"I am 8 weeks out from bilateral knee replacements. Knees are doing great. Extension is 100 for both. Still stiff and doing PT , however, I woke from surgery with right heal and underside of my foot numb. The numbness also includes the pinky toe. When walking I feel like a deflated football is under my foot. Under the deflated football is a bed of pins and needles. At first Doctor P A and physical therapist said I've never heard of that over and over. An x-ray of my foot and my back was. Taken, X-rays were within normal limits. The sensation is very frustrating and I'm worried that it's permanent I wondered if there is anyone else that has been through this and how long it took it for it to go away for them. Does someone have a suggestion I have tried reflexology and pressure point therapy with a chiropractor. The numbness has leveled out on the underside of my foot but has not diminished. I was prescribed an anti-inflammatory that did nothing and was told to resume ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, Tylenol every 4 hours. The pin and needle pain seems to diminish with this regiment. I can tell that my 8 hours is about to be up because my foot feels extremely swollen however looks absolutely normal other than my heel appearing a little on the white side. Some of the numbness extends up the back of my ankle but I am able to raise and move my toes a side of my pinky toe at times. I would love some thoughts on what is happening and if there is any suggestions on something I should try to get my foot back to Norm. I had no problem with my foot prior to surgery. I am not diabetic. I am 55 years old.

"No obvious cause. Started 24 hours ago and got worse. By last night, I could hardly move my leg - severe shouting pains when I tried to lift my leg. Sort of behind the knee. Definitely, when I moved a certain way.
Today its 75% better I'd say - at least I can walk. Still a bit of dull ache but hugely better - no more shooting pain.
What could it be? Trapped nerve possibly?
I do wonder if I slept with my leg in a strange position the night before and somehow inflamed things. (Fell asleep on sofa until 4am!) with my legs up on recliner.

I could not get comfortable toss and turned and finally 4 am I got up the pain was bad enough I took 2 pain pills ( 4mg of Dilaudid ) now its 5am and it feel better. I am guessing today is going to be a rough one. The nurse comes by to check my blood because of the PICC line around 830ish and the therapist on or about same time frame. Then this afternoon I see the surgeon and the infection specialist fingers crossed everything is okay. My biggest concern is keeping the pain at a reasonable level I know narcotics are helpful but lets face it look at how many get addicted to them. Hopefully he can offer some suggestions other wise life is not going to pleasant.

"Hello, wanted to see if I could just get some input/thoughts on my knee issue.  I am currently waiting on MRI results and to see a orthopedic doc in a few days. I will try to keep short.
Around 9 weeks ago I awoke with a swollen right knee.  I had done some light squats day before. there was tightness around knee and behind.  For 4 weeks I just dealt with it.  Hurting with sudden movements and stairs.  Five weeks ago I felt a lump on back of knee. about 2"" long and 1"" thick.  Thought it was a muscle bulge or something.  Went to stretch a little and heard a loud 'pop'.  Wife even heard it. right away lump completely gone.  two days later, pain all way down leg with swollen/sore calf and ankle.  Went to primary doc and he says I ruptured a Bakers cyst.  Set me up for MRI, ultrasound and orthopedic doc visit.  
Its been 9 weeks total now and ankle/calf swelling has been down for a week.  My knee still hurts the same as 9 weeks ago.  Pain inside, front left quarter of knee.  I can also feel what seems like a slight tear feeling on back.  any sudden movement, or funny steps and there is pain. 
Now, primary doc has just emailed me saying ultrasound(done on back of knee) shows the cyst and fluid buildup.  Says probably from a calf injury, not knee. No mention of MRI.  Says to wait for orthopedic visit in a few days(this will be 2nd ortho visit). 
So, I have only had calf pain once that cyst ruptured 5 weeks ago.  How can a cyst, and my knee pain, be caused by an calf injury if i had zero calf pain for the first month of my knee injury?  Every single thing i have read is the bakers cyst was caused by something wrong in knee, letting the fluid escape.
thank you for reading/input.

"Hi All. Whilst I know that there is no ""normal"" I am depressed that after almost five months past medial partial knee I cannot walk without pain. I have no pain  when sitting but getting going after sitting is a nightmare, I need a walking stick. I am sleeping better and at last being in bed is not a chore but as soon as I stand and start walking that is weight bearing I am in pain. It goes within an hour of taking paracetamol but is back again four hours later.
i don't want to keep taking tablets. Has anyone else experienced this at five months?
I can straight fully and have excellent ROM at about 135+. I exercise with a personal trainer twice a week to build up muscle and also do,it at home and ride a static bike.
I just don't seem to be able to walk for very long. Anyone any ideas please? I am getting very depressed. Forgot to,say I had the same op on the other knee last June and although it still isn't pain free (I now have OA in the knee cap) by this time I wasn't taking any pain relief.

"On the 9th January I had TKR and the bone in leg cut and straightened. This was following two nasty falls, neither were my fault. 
I had an amazing surgeon Professor Anan Shetty in U.K., cannot recommend this gentleman enough. 
I had had two multi fractures previously and stem cell. Leg was bent out over 12 degrees, my mobility really impaired. 
I went back to work after 4 weeks,  as financially I had no option but to go back early. Now with hind sight it was much much to soon. 
My Chico Marx advise kept me going. I have his picture of what we think and what our actual journey is on my desk. 
It’s a journey, you get out what you put in. I’m still having Physio, still exercising. They never thought my leg would be straight and thought it would need the last 4 degrees manually straightened. 
I’m there, 0 percent straight 125 to 130 bend. 
My advise, look at Mr Marx links, do your exercises, persevere, it is worth it. My life has been turned around. 
I have just returned from holiday, I payed on a sun bed for the first time in 5 yrs. I sat on the sand for the first time in 11 years. I hadn’t been able to get up
Prior to this. 
Have faith, carry in with your journey, the results will come. It is a journey but a worthwhile. Good luck everyone.

"so, had mua Tuesday night, consultant says he got it from 30 degree to 100 degree, spent 12 of next 15 hours on cpm machine at 0-90 degree to ensure that didn’t lose gain. Sent home with slightly conflicting advice. Consultant wanted me to do Physio daily for 2 weeks along with daily use of cpm machine. Physio said that I didn’t really need cpm machine as a) he didn’t have one to lend me and b) said I needed to do exercises anyway..
so woke up this morning and my knee is massive and in pain, mainly from soft tissue damage from mua and being forced to bend by cpm machine, I could barely bend knee but after speaking to Physio and sitting in a high chair and using a skateboard probably got to 75/80 degrees. 
The cpm machine  can be hired privately for £300 for a month which I’m happy to pay..
would you get one or not?

"I'm a 49yr old male of a large 20st stature and 8 weeks on Tuesday I had a TKR on my left knee.
If I knew that the past 7.5 weeks was going to be this painful & uncomfortable I would never have had this done. All I was ever given & advised was success stories, I wish I had researched it in more detail as I would rather have suffered the knee problems I had compared to the ones I have now.
Although my PT is happy with my progress regarding leg bend of 115 & extension of -1, I come away full of smiles BUT the smile is very short lived. I still cant get comfortable, still cant sleep at night, cant sleep on my side and the pain during the night is ridiculous (I've tried the pillow in-between my legs), I have totally had enough, I'm still taking Tramadol to try & ease but now it's having little effect.
I've been walking unaided for almost 4 weeks now (by advice of my PT) but the problem I have is the swelling, the swelling just does not go down, I elevate my leg at least every 2 - 3 hours for 30mins at a time and still wear my cyrocuff for the icing at the same time. I have a sharp pain in my knee at times even while I'm just sitting still, my surgeon says there is nothing to be concerned about, again he is happy.
I do 3 x 1hr of home exercise & stretching which was advised by my surgeon and PT everyday without fail & try to push myself further each time.
I seem to have a fold across the centre of the knee which fills with swelling & then overhangs the bottom half of my knee which then makes my leg feel very stiff and heavy. My knee for pretty much 90% of the time feels stiff especially when I clench my thigh muscle. The left hand side of my knee is completely numb and the right hand side is so sensitive to touch or have any material on it, which again don't help me whilst in bed keeping me awake.
Am I doing something wrong? Will the pain ever ease? Will I be able to sleep again properly? When will this swelling ever come down? How long before I stop regretting having this procedure done? I am constantly feeling down & depressed that all that's on my mind is this bloody knee & if it will ever be ""Normal""
Sorry for the long winded story and the whining, I need to know if others have gone through the same, as I know 2 people who have had the procedure done one was fully recovered in 6 weeks and the other in 8 weeks, so that's why I'm feeling so cheesed off and full of regret. It's also easier to talk to others who have gone or going through the same than ask my surgeon or PT.
Your advice would be greatly appreciated, Thanks in advance.

"Finally spoke to the Surgeon nothing earth shattering but it was good to hear. I have lots of pain and swelling there is nothing good about any of it. The nurse has been worried about my pain and swelling same with the therapist getting ahold of my Dr. is tough but its not all his fault he had his knee done 4 days after mine. So as much as I as well as others have told everyone be patient I am guilty as well. I have had unreasonable expectations concerning my recovery. The facts are I have had 18 surgeries 6 of which have been replacements he said it might take 6 months or longer before I start feeling better. He also said and Chico will appreciate this I have to exercise and push it. It is going to hurt but the harder I push the faster it will get better. This was not exactly what I wanted to hear but at least its not getting worse all the results have come back good its just going to take a lot of work on my part. So the pain did not go away but its much better knowing that given my situation everything is okay.

"Hello and thanks for taking time to read this. I’m going through the VA for healthcare and have reinjured my left knee. Previously I have had x3 surgeries (2 open, 1 arthroscopic) for meniscus repairs, patellar tendon repairs, and others. I have also had several kneecap dislocations. The latest injury was probably the most painful. My appointment with ortho is next week but I received the MRI results today. I understand that this forum is just opinions, but wondering if anyone could help interpret what the MRI says as I wait to be seen. The comments from the MRI are below (an thanks for your help in advance):
Joint effusion is noted. Scattered loose bodies are present. Suprapatellar plica are noted. Postoperative changes are once again noted in the medial patella. There is irregularity and fraying of the patellar cartilage. Areas of bony edema are noted within the patella. There is cartilage loss noted involving the medial femoral tibial compartment. Cartilage loss of the lateral proximal tibia also noted.  Posterior horn of the medial meniscus is truncated and demonstrates a linear horizontal area of increased signal suspicious for a tear Small bone fragments are noted adjacent to the patella.

"I was due for a tkr last December but the op was cancelled due to bmi being too high for nhs rules .
i received a cortisone injection which has been amazing for 3 months and only recently wore off , this week I’ve recieved a 2nf injection - in the 3 months I’ve lost 2 stone by being able to work and hope to lose more weight in the coming months ,
have cortisone injections worked for people on here and how many can you have done in total?
if I continue to lose weight is it possible with the injections to put off the tkr for a couple more years ?

"My knee has been quite painful over the past couple of weeks. I say my knee but it’s actually. from the bottom of my knee going down my shin. It feels like it’s twisting and it really really hurts. It’s kind of how I’d imagine it to feel if the cement had come lose. Gosh! This is really hard to explain but has anyone else experienced this kind of thing?

"Last time I had a revision by the end of the first month I may not have felt great but I did feel better then this. Then I felt like going for short walks could not wait to go in car had more energy etc. Now putting it bluntly I feel like CRAP!!!! I have no energy every day is the same wake up in pain go to bed in pain the only relief when I am sleeping but getting to sleep is a challenge as well trying to get comfortable with a swollen knee is no fun. I have tried to cut back on pain meds all that does is cause an increase in pain ( that stinks ) What am I supposed to say yes I have been thru this BS before now I am at # 6 sure I can offer suggestions for those lucky enough that this is their first time but who understands what I am going thru unless you have been thur lots of surgeries all on the same knee working on the 6th revision what can you say?? The bad thing or good it depends all tests have come back good however the pain part just sucks.

"I have a question: How does a successful TKR feel? After let's say 2 years, are we suppose to feel any discomfort/pain? I am 19 months post L. TKR and have issues with some pain and discomfort in the tibia/fibula bones when I lean over to touch the ground, pick up things in the yard. My TKR was Oct. 19, 2016 and I had the routine 6 week x-rays that show some small sliver of a gap in the tibia area (mine was a press fit TKR because I am allergic to the bone cement). The bone has to grow into the implant. I have always assumed the bone growing was the pain I feel? Anyway, I ask my PCP for a x-ray and I had it done today. She wrote me back saying: ""Your L. knee x rays series showed findings that could suggest loosening of the tibia component of your knee prosthesis. The formal component appears intact. Kindly follow up with your treating orthopedic surgeon for your L knee and leg pain"". I plan to make an appt. with the orho for follow up but the way I feel right now there is NO way I would let him go back in for another TKR!

"I had a TKR six years ago whilst living in Spain.
in addition to the knee I had rods inserted in my shin and thigh bones, for additional support I was told.
however it was far from successful and I am still in a lot of pain, since returning to the UK I have been offered a knee revision but I have done a lot of research into this operation and it appears very risky with many complications and may indeed make things worse
Has anyone out there had this operation, if so I would love to hear from you.
Two weeks ago today I had my other knee replaced which I think has been a success as I can already walk unaided

"This is going to be a long read so I apologize for that, but I really need some help.
Details:
Age - 25
Height - 5""8
Weight - 144 lbs
Gender - Male
Medications - Aleve 1000mg
Smoking Status - Non-smoker
Previous and current medical issues - Just this left knee issue
Duration and Location of complaint - Left knee, 1.5 years
I was an extremely athletic individual before this happened. February of last year I started feeling pains when I was pushing myself on the exercise bike. I continued pushing through it and when it got real bad I did an extreme leg weightlifting session which had my muscles in pain for days thinking it could help. After that, my knee/leg blew up with fluid and stayed that way since. Like a foolish idiot, I didn't get treatment right away. It wasn't until 9 months later that I had surgery on the knee.
Pre-surgery MRI of the knee:
EXAM: MRI right knee.
COMPARISON: MRI left femur same day, MRI left femur 10/10/2017, plain radiographs 10/03/2017.
HISTORY: Knee pain.
TECHNIQUE: Axial PDFS, Cor PD, Cor PDFS, Sag PD, and Sag T2FS sequences performed.
FINDINGS: There is a large joint effusion. Complex thickened irregular synovial tissue is noted particular the suprapatellar recess. Fluid dissects along the lateral and posterior margin of the distal femoral metadiaphysis. Sub-centimeter lymph nodes are present in the popliteal fossa. Skin thickening and reticulation of subcutaneous fatty tissues is fairly prominent at the lateral margin of the distal thigh with mild myositis involving the short head biceps muscle belly posterolaterally. Complex synovial fluid dissects proximally were into the thigh please refer to MRI dictation of the left femur performed same day. Subtle low signal is noted along at least a portion of the synovial lining likely related to hemorrhagic deposition/hemosiderin. There is mild heterogeneity of the marrow involving the distal femur proximal tibia and fibula suggesting osteopenia which may be related to disuse. Hyperemia related osteopenia could present in a similar fashion. Despite the large joint effusion there is no evidence of focal osseous erosion. The cartilage is well maintained.
Ligaments: Anterior cruciate ligament fibers demonstrate no acute pathology.Posterior cruciate ligament fibers demonstrate no acute pathology.
Superficial and deep MCL fibers intact.Lateral collateral ligament complex including the popliteal tendon intact. Meniscus: Medial meniscus is unremarkable.
Lateral meniscus is unremarkable.
Cartilage: No high-grade chondromalacia present.
Extensor mechanism: Quadriceps and patellar tendons intact.
Complex synovial fluid dissects into the pre femoral fat pad.
IMPRESSION: 1. Complex dissecting synovial fluid collection extending from the suprapatellar recess about the distal femoral metadiaphysis into the popliteal fossa and dissecting proximally into the thigh. There is complexity to the collection with internal septations and proteinaceous debris. Skin thickening and reticulation of subcutaneous fatty tissues present. There is osteopenia at the joint. Constellation of findings raises suspicion of indolent infection such as TB. There is relatively well-preserved cartilage. No definitive erosion. Subtle low signal along the portions of the capsular tissue suggests hemosiderin deposition associated with the aspirated hemorrhage. Although PVNS is not entirely excluded, it is considered less likely given the aggressive dissecting fluid which is more typically seen in the setting of infection.
Pre-surgery MRI of the femur:
EXAM: MRI left thigh without and with contrast
COMPARISON: None.
HISTORY: Left thigh pain
TECHNIQUE: Long axis T1, PDFS and STIR, axial T1, axial T2, axial T1 fat sat pre and postcontrast, long axis T1FS post contrasted images performed prior to and following intravenous administration 7mL Gadavist.
FINDINGS: Osseous structures: There is no fracture nor concerning marrow lesion present.
Soft tissues: Extensive inflammatory changes present at the knee with a complex septated fluid dissecting proximally to the mid diaphyseal level of the thigh reference coronal image 20. This extends 18 cm proximal to the knee joint at the lateral margin at the junction of the anterior and posterior compartments along the deep fascia. This communicates with the popliteal fossa roughly 9 cm proximal to the joint reference axial image 22. Thickening of the wall and internal septations are present throughout the collection with adjacent subcutaneous edematous changes and skin thickening. The crescentic collection in the popliteal fossa and at the distal diaphyseal/metadiaphyseal level demonstrates peripheral enhancement on axial postcontrast image 21. The transverse diameter of the collection posterior to the femur measures 4.3 cm. The focus extending to the subcutaneous fatty tissues extends 3.9 cm AP with an average depth of approximately 1.5 cm transverse. The peripheral enhancing a dissecting fluid demonstrates a slightly irregular and thickened wall. Sub-centimeter lymph nodes are present in the popliteal fossa. The collection appears to communicate with the knee joint with the irregular and moderately thickened septations noted at the suprapatellar recess. The suprapatellar recess collection is also thickened and irregular with internal septations present. The patient as the parotid the working clinical diagnosis of PVNS. This could result in blood-tinged joint fluid, however the degree of dissection and irregularity of the process as well as subcutaneous edematous change is somewhat atypical. MRI findings are concerning for an indolent infection such as TB arthrosis. I do not clearly identify a focal nodular low signal region nor bony erosive change on this examination.
Neurovascular: Vasculatures patent. Sub-centimeter popliteal lymph nodes present.
IMPRESSION: 1. Marked irregular inflammatory dissecting peripheral enhancing fluid extends from the knee cephalad 18 cm dissecting through the deep fascia into the subcutaneous fatty tissues with adjacent edematous change in the subcutaneous fat and dermis at the junction of the anterior and posterior compartment laterally. This insinuating dissecting process raises concern for indolent infection such as tuberculous arthrosis which can demonstrate significant fistulous communication. Gonnococcal infection should be considered as well. Large joint effusions related to intra-articular pathology typically demonstrate a more organized geographic distribution with thin septations and wall enhancement. Certainly, I cannot exclude PVNS, however indolent infection must be excluded based on these imaging findings.
So the doctors were thinking infection. I was taken to the operating room around mid-November and had an arthroscopic synovectomy performed. The abnormal tissue growth was biopsied and showed absolutely no growth. The way this tissue was described to me was that it looked like a pimple and when it was squeezed, orange pus-like fluid came out. After the surgery my OS put me on bactrim and I started running fevers and had elevated liver enzymes. The infectious disease team at the hospital ran all sorts of tests on me and everything came back negative. Once I was off the bactrim, oddly that stopped so it turned out I was allergic to bactrim. However, they did do another MRI about a month later.
1-month post-op MRI of the knee:
MRI of the left knee without with contrast
Comparison: X-ray. MRI from 11/09/2017
Technique: Coronal STIR and T1, axial T2, T1, PD fat sat, T1 fat sat pre and postcontrast with a dose 7 mL Gadavist. Coronal T1 fat sat postcontrast also performed.
History: Inflammatory process previously identified.
Findings:
Bony structures: Mild rather diffuse edema is seen in the proximal tibia and distal femur most consistent with disuse osteopenia. No other bony findings are identified.
There remains a large effusion in the joint. There is some peripheral synovial enhancement but no nodularity is seen. No low signal is seen to suggest PVNS. There is surrounding edema with enhancement extending into the vastus medialis and lateralis. This consistent with mild myositis. The supra patellar effusion extends about center and centimeters proximal to the knee joint. There is edema posterior to the knee and also a small additional locule of fluid extending laterally from the posterior joint. The extensive multiloculated appearance seen in this region on the prior study has improved.
IMPRESSION: 1. There remains a large effusion with some surrounding enhancement and myositis. No nodularity or low signal is seen to suggest nodular or pigmented villonodular synovitis. Overall this is most likely represent some form of infection. Additional loculated pocket of fluid is seen posteriorly but the complex multiloculated appearance seen previously is somewhat improved. The effusion extends least 10 cm proximal to the knee joint. Proximal to this is not visible on this knee exam. 2. Disuse osteopenia
Infectious disease doctors told me that things look the same on the MRI, maybe a little bit better. 5 months post-op, another doctor told me that the moderate amount of fluid on my knee is possibly permanent. However, I am now 8-months post-op and quite a lot has changed for the better. My left knee actually resembles my good one in shape, BUT there is still noticeable swelling around it especially on the sides and extending above the kneecap. That being said, my knee was never drained post-op except once right after when I started running fevers. I did try to go back to my OS to have it drained about 2 weeks ago, but he told me there really isn't enough fluid in there for him to drain it, so that's a good thing right? He did give me a cortisone shot (didn't help), and put me on medrol for a week (slowly helped out but once I stopped it the knee stopped getting better). I am now on Aleve to keep targetting the inflammation.
So my question basically is, is it possible that complex septated synovial tissue can go back to normal on it's own? My knee has obviously gotten much better so I'm hoping so, but I figured you guys would have a better idea of how this works in the body. I have full range of motion, can do a full squat but very awkwardly and with some pain and I do feel the fluid in there.
On a side note, can the fluid on my knee also cause knee crepitus? It only happens when I'm laying down and move my leg or when I tense my leg muscles and then move it.
Thank you for reading this and thank you for any help you can offer!! I do plan on trying to make another appointment with my OS and seeing if we can do another MRI just to see what's going on and why there is still some excess fluid still there after 8 months, but my mind is going crazy. It's been a long-time and I've been so hopeless and depressed over it. Thanks again for any input!!

"There was a study done, some years ago, that showed if you are overweight, losing 10% of that weight improves the inflammation and pain of arthritis. Now they've done a study showing that losing 20% or more reduces the arthritis even more. Something to think about before going under the knife.
Of course, this is not an option for many people whose knee(s) are too far gone but something to think about for others.

"LTKR May 2017 had allergic reaction complications and ended up in a wheelchair for 10 months. I am now walking with one crutch but would like to avoid RTKR. I have had a cortisone injection which only worked for 2 weeks; had to wait 6 months before getting a Synvisc injection which worked 3 months and am eligible for another Synvisc injection at the end of July. Have lipogems worked for anyone? If so, has it been a ""permanent"" solution or does the injection have to be administered intermittently? 
Here is what I read-""Capitalizing on the fact that your fat tissue contains the highest concentration of reparative cells compared to other tissue, the patented Lipogems® process extracts and purifies a small amount of your fat tissue.
Then the new tissue is injected to help facilitate a healing environment that  can repair, replace, or reconstruct damaged or injured tissue. 
This innovative process is available, through specific orthopedic surgeons and other specialists, and may be the answer you’ve been searching for.""

"Had my replacement on5/15 at the age of 52.  Came home on a Thursday with home health. By Monday the Cumbiam had raised my blood to a 6.8. So the Dr thought I probably had some blood on my knee. My extension was only a 70. 
Started out patient the following Tuesday and by that time my extension was a 66.  The therapist was very aggressive but really only focused on straightening the leg. I would literally cry during one of the procedures he would do. I could not been my knee hardly at all. When he tried I screamed and the pain of a feeling of a sharp knife going down a up from knee was unbearable. He then decided that I had scar tissue. 
My bend at that time was 75. 
At 6 weeks I had a MUA. I go tomorrow for my 7 day check up with Dr.   With the therapist forcing I can get 111 but I can only get 93 by myself. I do my exercises and ride a little bike but feel like I have failed in my recovery. So I am pretty sure I’m going to get chewed out tomorrow by my Dr tomorrow for not having the outcome he expected.

"Before everyone say you need patience etc I am well aware of that this is not my first time I wish it was but its not. I was told at the hospital and at my first follow up visit considering the amount of surgeries I have had all on the same knee plus this was my 6 th replacement the pain is going to worse I can assure everyone that is the God's honest truth. By rights and by my average going into the 3rd week I should be getting around a little better my pain levels should be in the 6-7 range not in the 7-8 range. If this was a first replacement yes I would be driving me nuts but I would be doing more and in general feeling  better not great but better. The way it is now I feel like I am at least 2 weeks behind and counting. I am either in pain or lots of pain neither is comfortable. I called the Therapist today and I have to scale back on the exercises before I can move forward my pain level has to get under better control. After therapy last Friday I was beyond miserable all weekend. If things are normal after therapy you will be sore I on the other hand I bypass sore and go straight to pain. I use ice and elevate all day I take my pain meds Hydromorphone 8mg 2 every 5-6 hours. Yes it helps but who wants to be drowsy all day now maybe if I was in my 20's this would be great but not now. This sounds bad but if I was a horse with a bad leg the cure would be to shoot the horse. Yes that sounds drastic but deal with constant pain it gets to you after awhile.

"Hi everybody, after some two years of ""To be or not to be"" finally on the 22th of May this year it went under the knife... Although I wanted the two of them I am glad my surgeon convinced me to go for one. All went better than expected and by the second day I was walking and socializing with other patients, on the fifth day I was transferred to rehab and four days later went home having achieved over 110 degrees flex without too much hard work. ( I thought this is easy ) By the fourth week my knee started experiencing some inflammation and my GP said that some patients will have this situation for some time even for several months ( this was also shared by my surgeon's assistant ) what it worries me is that the fluids around my knee are persisting even when ice is applied on the area and I can only flex about 90 degrees and any further will hurt. Would any one of you kind people be able to bring some relief with your own experiences ( maybe the same) as I am a bit concern and thinking should I call my surgeon again????

"LTKR, from day 1 the swelling in my leg, from my toes to my hip was horrible, I had pools of blood under my skin, it was impossible to bend my knee. The swelling was causing pressure on my skin from even a crease in the sheet hurt, By day 5 I was at my wits end. A friend suggested I try a lymphatic drainage massage which I had on day 6, followed by an uncomfortable night and hourly trips to the bathroom. Day 7 dawned and the swelling was reduced by half, I could bend my knee to 80 degrees, I could walk (on crutches) and the pain was almost gone. Another restless night followed with hourly bathroom trips. TODAY It's day 8 and this morning I've noticed that the pools of blood
and the bruising and more of the swelling is gone. Feeling positive about the rest of my recovery.

"I haven't posted for a long while now as things have been going really well. I had a patellafemoral athroplasty (plastic knee cap and metal trochlea) replacement in March 2015 but during this current spell of really hot weather in the UK I've been experiencing a feeling of severe tightness in my operated knee. I have no trouble with movement, no swelling, but something definitely feels different. It aches all the time, sometimes across knee cap, sometimes down the outside of my leg and also in the crook of my knee. I've no idea what's going on but just wondered if hot weather can make the metal swell a little. Sounds silly I know but I can't think what else might be setting this off. Am also trying to drink more so that I don't get dehydrated as I'm aware muscles don't work as well when not hydrated. I also suffer with fibromyalgia. Any ideas anyone?

"Someone has recommended the use of DMSO a natural bi product of wood to help ease the throbbing I have just above my knee. It's like a pulsing nerve and makes the knee very uncomfortable. 
I would be very interested to learn whether anyone has tried DMSO after TKR and has it helped at all.
I am seriously considering giving it a try as the constant throbbing is just driving me crazy and very debilitating

"Hi
I will be 5 weeks on Wednesday doing ok bend not great but working on that. my incision is a little behind in healing it is one long scab,  the scab has dropped of in one or two places and it is fine underneath but the incision not looking like i thought it would after looking at others online. PT says there is now infection and district nurses was happy with it at week three but i thought it would look a little better than it does.
Has anyone else  had this problem it is slightly red in places which I think may still be the stuff they put on the leg before the op there is nothing coming from the wound.
Any advice appreciated

"Hi 
Im just after some advice, as I can’t see my doctor til Tuesday and having a massive anxiety at the moment. I’m having constant left hip pain near my pelvis area, left kneee pain and lower left back pain, I’m not sure what it could be every time I google it states cancer and I’m on the verge on tears as iv never experience such pain before, it sort of alternates aswell between right hip and right knee, I’m 32 female, generally in good Heslth, I was involved in a hit and run where the car hit me from behind as I was about to take my baby out of the car ,a few months back, but I was left with bruises only. My dr never ordered any scans or anything like that as at the time I didn’t have any other symptoms of bone pain so not sure if it’s related, I do attend physio but haven’t me mention my pain as it first started last week when I got my periods then it went away and it started again four days later,would anyone know what this could be, I’m sorry for the long post I’m just so worried that it could be something bad as I never get aches and pains in my hip area

"Hi,
I am 27 years old and recently (13 weeks ago) had a complete tear of my ACL with reconstruction needed. The reconstruction surgery happened 6 weeks ago with a hamstring graft. I haven't been able to walk without a major bend in my injured leg for the entire 13 weeks. 2 weeks ago, they were concerned that because of the amount of pain that I'm still in and with no progress being made with extension, that they would perform a manipulation and try to break up what they thought was scar tissue that was built up early. The doctor who performed the reconstruction did the manipulation. He took pictures during the manipulation to prove to me that my leg had gone almost perfectly straight while under anesthesia. He continues to reassure me to push through the pain as everything is healing nicely. A nerve block was placed during the manipulation and allowed my leg to almost extend to 0 degrees in a CPM machine. I still had a hard time on my own to get it to 0 myself. It has been 2 weeks since the nerve block was removed and I am right back where I started. I am spending 6 hours a day in the CPM machine but my leg freezes at around 20-30 degrees of extension (as just velcro straps are holding my leg in). I have bought a TENS unit to utilize the neuromusclar controls to try and reduce pain. I have purchased kinesiotape, different ice packs, been on 3 different pain medications. I am wondering what the issue could be? It seems to move a tiny bit better when I am sleeping and somebody observes me in the CPM machine. I am still unable to walk without a crutch or if I do, my form is off and my hip and back are starting to hurt due to compensation. I am being sent this week to a sports medicine doc with focus on nerves as my doctor thinks it might be a subconscious event going on that my body is not allowing me to straighten my leg. I am losing a lot of muscle in my quad and calfs because of this. I hoping for any advice or anybody with a similar experience. I know that I am only 6 weeks out but with PT 3/4 times a week (spending almost 3 hours there and ZERO progress being made (as told to me by 3 different PT's)) I am getting very concerned. I want to catch whatever is going on, sooner rather than later. Thanks!

"at 8 months i am having some concerns that i did not do ample therapy and exercises after my surgery. i live hours away from my surgeon in a third world country, so basically have been doing things on my own. saw him a few times and he saw recent xrays and stated that everything is fine. perhaps i did not understand totally what he was recommending as for not completely fluent in spanish and medical terms non existant. was instructed to continue with things as i used to, including construction as pain and range of movement would allow. went off medication a few weeks ago and take only when in real pain, but i must say that there is pain when i walk. i limp quite a bit. i walk a couple of kms a day though. now the real question.......has my lack of proper therapy exercises greatly affected my recovery?  i read last night about scar tissue preventing being able to extend my leg straight and bending more than 90 degrees. the internet vid gave demonstrations of comparing good and bad legs straight. i was shocked how different they are. i know i was absent on doing the shown exercises, i was just doing standing squats and a lot of stair climbing, but not any stretches to build up my quads or  muscles.i have always rebounded from any sports injury  much faster than anyone. oh, i am 62, but very active. today i have started on new exercizes i located on the net, preforming 5 times a day would be my plan. thanks for any recommendations!

"HI All
For the past 4 weeks I have had a very sharp knife like pain through the bottom of my knee where it meets the tibia. It is so painful I am almost unable to walk. Its hard to describe but its as if something is sticking a sharp bit into another part of the knee. (I know it doesn't make sense!) I had a partial medial knee replacement exactly 1 year ago (20 June 2017) and although it has been painful, just like everyone else on here (especially the first 5 months) this is something Very different. It isn't hot or swollen or red but very painful to touch it. I have been overusing it a bit as I had my other knee done three months ago and so it was taking the weight. But I was back at the gym (very mild exercise to build back up) and thought everything was going well I now need 2 crutches to walk, and today it almost seems the new one is going the same way.
Has anyone else experienced this? I have an appointment with the surgeon but I  am worried either the implant is loose or its an infection (I have had 2 ear infections in the last 3 months).
I am really just having a rant and not expecting any answers but I am so frightened and my friends and family are probably completely fed up of me as this knee journey has now been three years. (Anthroscopy, then right PKR then left PKR) Even I am tired of the knee conversations and very fed up of being incapacitated and in pain.
I just don't know whether to exercise and fight through the pain, or rest as I might be doing more damage. I haven't a clue.
Hope everyone else is enjoying this great weather, just bought a sun lounger to take advantage of it.
Thanks

"I might be a tad excessive when describing how my knee feels. I was told considering how many surgeries I have had it was going to hurt more ( which it does !!! ) and the recovery is going to take longer ( cannot verify that one yet ). I think in a manner of speaking I have gotten to the bonus round of pain the pain is either real bad or very bad no its not like what it was following the surgery and the meds wore off but trust me its driving me nuts. I am trying to figure out other ways to deal with this pain, icing and elevating all day long. Take dilaudid 4 mg every 4 hours take norco 10 w/act.325mg every 4 hours but stagger when I take them. I took the dilaudid at 7am will take the norco at 9am and so on. This helps but far from ideal. I totally understand when your laying on the sofa leg propped up knee is throbbing away and it hurts so bad the tears start flowing (well yes it happens every day and yes I have been there before but # 6 is no joke ) 
As far as exercising goes 105 for ROM pretty good considering the 18th was my surgery. I am working on heel slides using a belt and really trying to go beyond what my knee wants, sit on a chair and bend my knee as far as I can plus and then sit for a couple of minutes relax and do it again ten times. lay on bed squeeze quad muscles as hard as I can hold for 10 sec. relax and do it again. I am well aware patience is golden pain on the other hand is for the birds so does any one have any ideas on how they solved the pain issue??

"Besides the normal crummy stuff everyone deals with following surgery I did get some good news from the therapist. I am exactly one week PO my ROM is 90degrees!!! At this point some good is better then blah. Since everyone is concerned about the infection the therapist wants to make sure the incision is healed up before he really starts pushing it. Pain wise what would you like to read?? Being blunt it stinks and there are many other words that can be used as well. The therapist said overall my knee looks very good if I did not tell him how many surgeries I have had on the L knee he would have guessed this was my first.

"Hello,
I had my 3rd arthroscopy surgery a week ago. I saw the registrar Wednesday to take the stitches out. I had signed the consent form for them to do whatever with a view to get rid of the pain. 
They performed a chondropasty. Registrar said the cartilage was  ""tatty.""
It's the 3rd time they've tidied up the cartilage (+2 microfractures (one failed)) It's my understanding cartilage doesn't really regrow so how much can I have left now?
She said the arthritis is under the kneecap - apparently the side bits of my knee are sort of ok. 
She said they did this procedure in a bid to but me time rather than perform a patella replacement now as I'm too young (55). And the answer was to just mange the pain and keep weight down.
I just don't understand how chopping out more cartilage will help the arthritic bit.
I didnt really wan this done but felt there was no other option left to me. I told her I wasn't happy with my bend. She said ""you've got 90 degrees, that's ok"" Well I had that range of mobility - and better before. 
I can't help thinking I've put myself through a lot of pain for absolutely nothing. 
I had a bit of an argument with her over why they should replace earlier rather than later. I have a post op telephone consultation in  weeks.
Can anybody give me some explanation as to how chondroplasty helps arthritic knee cap? I just don't get it.
Had to move the car on the drive yesterday forwards then backwards to allow for a delivery - I can barely drive let alone do an emergency stop. I only went into 1st then reverse.
I am doing the exercises. Still a bit of swelling and bruising. Still painful - and the pain is where it always was - under the knee cap in the middle of the knee. 
Any answers?
Thank you

"Hi there,
Im 21 and have had osgood schlatters in my right knee since late primary school.
The pain went away years ago but I was left with a permanent, painless knee bump.
Over the years, although theres been no pain, I do have some slight, chronic sensitivity in the bump (especially when I've been very active). It seems like the bump has become slightly more prominent over the last few months, even though theres still no pain and sensitivity hasn't increased notably.
Firstly, is this even possible for OS disease?
Secondly, is surgery available for cosmetic reasons (the bump has always been large and now seems slightly larger)? I know its not recommended but Id like to know all the options.

I am not walking much because my hip needs replacing and I am wondering if my progress is  slow because of that. I really feel I am going one step forward, two steps back.

"Hello,
After a long run around and three different consultants - all with differing diagnoses. I went in on Thursday for my third knee arthroscopy.
I was  and still am nervous. The first in late 2013, debridement and microfracture, I was one of the 5% for whom things got worse - couldn't bend or kneel and off work for 4 months. Second in 2015, another debridement, microfracture and cutting of fat pad. Better results but gradual deterioration.
So back and forth to physio and consultants and the end result was  Thursday's op. I signed a consent form for him to do what he liked really - anything in a bid to get rid of the pain. 
Ended up with just the arthroscopic chondroplasty. 
So I am home doing exercises properly - have done them since the first op everyday anyway. Obviously swollen and tight at the moment. Getting around and trying to keep mobile and bending as much as I can
Now the question is how long should I be off work for? I've had varying answers from one week to 6-8. My sick note says 6 weeks. I do get full sick pay so money is not the problem.
I have to be able to drive for work, get in and out of the car - I work in the community. I have to be able to get up and down off the floor - I work with disabled pre-schoolers in their homes. I have to be able to kneel and high kneel. 
At the moment I have two roles at work - each 0.5 of my week.
The other half is more office based arranging meetings, chairing them and typing up minutes.
Previously the pain was also related to having my knee at right angles so sitting was an issue.
I am very concerned that this op should not fail - I don't want anything I do to compromise it. 
Does anyone have any answers or advice? I know it's a bit of an open ended question. My GP is concerned that it doesn't go wrong and said he wouldn't send me back till I was fit. 
Thank you all in advance

"I just had a manipulation on fri 4/7/17. It took all of about 30 min. I was at the hospital at 10am and I was home by 2 pm. I walked up my steps when I returned home. ( I live in a raised Beach house).
I started to have pain that evening in my upper thigh.
I went to sleep and woke up to pain still in my upper thigh. The pain wasn't more intense than the previous night. At about noon, I went to the gym and did aprox 30 min on the excercise bike. I was able to bend my knee enough to make it all the way around.
I then went and got in the pool and treded water for about 45 min doing bicycle kicking. I returned home to ice my knee. I was sore, but not too bad.
That night my wife and I went to a concert at the house of blues in Myrtle Beach SC. I did a good amount of walking and climbing stairs. I had a seat which helped me get through the concert.
The next day, Sunday, I sat around and iced my knee and did a little house work. I was sore in my thigh area. Not too bad though.
Monday I went to work then had physical therapy at 2 pm. I was a little stiff from work. The therapist measured my range as soon as I got to the office. It was 85 degrees with no problem. After therapy and warming up I reached 110 degrees without much problem or pain.
Prior to the surgery I had a max bend range of 90 degrees. I had my manipulation 8 weeks( to the day ) after my total knee replacement. I am a very active adult age 45.
If anyone has any concerns or is worried about a manipulation, don't be. You have already gone through the hard part. The pain from the manipulation was cake. I really didn't even have pain in my knee. The pain I had was in my thigh.
Go ahead , don't worry. Do it, so you can bend it.
I am 3 days out from manipulation and I can barely tell I had it done.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Well I can assure everyone the more times you get a revision the more it hurts and yes my L knee is screaming but its not like I was not expecting it either just hoping that maybe not as bad. Since I have had lots of PO bleeding ( the dressing from the hospital was supposed to last 10days was saturated Thursday night ( it was in a word gross!!! ) with really dark almost black blood and it was changed Thursday night and twice yesterday ) I was told to limit activity to just the basics glad I have my kids to help out!! Another plus do not have to start PT till Monday and yes it kind of puts me behind but I do not want anymore blood oozing all over the place either. When the Therapist came by she was amazed since everything she was about to tell me I already knew. I showed her how I walk with my crutches she wanted to see how I get on my bed ( I have been doing this for so long its habit ) I put my R foot under my L foot and use the R leg to help in lifting my L leg on the bed. I will be doing therapy the 1st week 3X and from then on 2X a week. The rest of the week I will using Chico menu for exercises. I never wrote them down I just did them from memory. Its is going to be a long road to recovery in my case it may take a year or longer due to the amount of surgeries I have had. Yes I am fully aware of how miserable it will be but its no different then the past 5 with the one exception the pain level is higher.

Since then fell over into knee and badly bruised it consultant thought it was meniscus tear.  Did 3rd arthroscopy and showed a lot of wear and tear and arthritus.  Still in pain, effects my sleep and daily routine.  Last week had a cortisone injection, not felt any benefit yet, initially seemed easier but then same pain back.  Consultant has advised knee replacement would be the next step but I am young.  He said my knee is in a pretty bad way.  Not sure on the time scale and what to do regarding this. Any help would be appreciated. ;-)

"Just got back today surgery went sort of okay. The Dr. sent out 5 cultures to be tested and as I have feared 4 came back negative one did not. I have a Staph infection and considering my history with a previous infection they want to treat this one aggressively so as I was afraid of I now have a PICC line for the next 6 weeks. There is no guarantees that I will not have further problems my surgeon said I may have to have a spacer put in 6 months from now depending on how things go. I have been thru a lot and I have tried to be in a good mood joking trying to mate other smile but today I broke down I am miserable to the point of tears I just feel lost??

"Anyone have this issue and procedure?  Once the partial meniscectomy is completed how does the knee recovery?  Isn't no cartilage that bone to bone?  One would think the pain would continue.  Is this worth the procedure??
In addition to rising/lowering to seats/toilets; in/out of vehicles; walking up/down stairs, I'm having pain lying down on my bed trying to sleep - none weight bearing.
Surprised that the surgeon isn't interested in trying to stitch it together only remove.  MRI says the meniscus looks good other than the tear.
Just recovered from two shoulder surgeries in 2017.  Not looking forward to another on my knee; wearing a hinged brace at the moment. Thanks

"I had a Partial Knee Replacement  in Sept of 2017 and I healed fine and by Jan 2018 I started having a lot of pain in my leg and especially around the area that was operated on.  I made an appointed with my Surgeon and at first he said it probably was Arthritis and Scar tissue and prescribed me some Etodolac which is for inflammation.  After the medicine did not work at all and my pain increased almost daily I called him back and he sent me for a bone scan and found out that the plastic was coming apart from the cement in my knee which could be possibly causing all the pain and after being aggressive and the high levels of pain my Family Medicine Doctor sent me to see a Second Opinion Surgeon and now l will have to have a full knee replacement.  This Orthopedic Surgeon agreed that the Uni will have to come out of my knee and be replaced with a Total Knee now.  I will be having that July 9 2018 because I can barely stand the pain and the piece is hitting a nerve in my leg and radiating Pain...

"I had a left TKR about 5 months ago. I was walking down the stairs and my knee gave out, I caught myself but my knee was flexed further then it naturally would flex (110) This was about 9 days ago and since then I have had increased pain in the kneecap area. I see my doctor in 10 days. I'm taking gabapentin 300 mg in a.m. and 600 mg in pm, I also take Tramadol 100 mg 2-3 × a day and Tylenol and ibuprofen prn. When I take the meds I get relief for about 2 hours and have difficulty sleeping at night. Not sure if I did real damage to my knee.

"My TKR was 3 months ago and 4 weeks ago I have a manipulation under anesthesia as my knee was frozen around 85 degrees. I am now aat 110 degrees after agressive PT, but I cannot get that on my own. It is a struggle at each appointment. I still have swelling and feel so stiff, the progress the PT makes does not in there for very long. I have started therapy in a pool, hoping that will help. This is very depressing. I was not prepared for such a huge/long recovery. and the psychological part really took me by suprise. Tears all over the place! I feel very out of control.

"In April I experienced a severe, level 6 ""tearing"" pain that went through my right patellar ligament, patella, and into the quadriceps tendon during an incline press exercise to treat osteoarthritic joint pain.
The next day I felt a ""razor blade""-like flash of pain through the ligament, and the day after that I experienced yet another tear-like sensation--once again going through the ligament, patella, with ""biting"" pain at the patella-tendon junction--that forced me to substantially slow down an elliptical bike session before having to pause from fatigue. And after the initial tearing pain a continual ""stretched"" pain/stiffness in the ligament.
The next day I reported all this during a visit to the doc and no explanation for the ligament pain aside from possible tendonitis and no evidence of swelling in the joint, but for the next two months fairly continual ligament and tendon pain, stiffness, and irritation that generally increased with exertion, especially after extensive ""clamshell"" exercising that neither therapists nor docs can explain aside from ""That shouldn't happen."".
Fast forward to last week and finally an MRI scan to examine all this.
The verdict? Osteoarthritis, ligament and tendon ""intact"", but a ""complex tear of the posterior horn to body segment of the medial meniscus"" along with a ""complex hyperintense cystic lesion"".
I am in the process of translating all this into English, but it looks like meniscal tears have to be treated, through therapy or surgery, and sooner rather than later.
Just as well that I had this looked at, but I am totally confused because I haven't experienced any ""locking"" except for a jolting pain in the knee during a simple sit-to-stand exercise two days before the exam, and never any obvious swelling.
And when I looked into causes of meniscal tears, one explanation
""Medial meniscal injuries are usually considered as either traumatic or degenerative. Whilst degenerate tears may present with a gradual history of increasing symptoms, traumatic injuries will usually occur as the knee is extended and rotated from a flexed position against resistance. This may occur as a single event during a sporting endeavor or during a period of unaccustomed squatting such as laying flooring or playing with children. The most commonly injured area is the posterior horn.""
Click here to view image
While Googling ""Meniscal Tear Patterns - Radsource"" will bring a decent explanation and images of ""complex"" meniscal tears.
Sounds close to the injury that brought on the ligament/tendon pain and the MRI.
But I'm still confused, because if anything the left ""OK"" knee has a ""clicky"" crepitus while the right has a smoother, audible ""crickly"" crepitus, and I've actually had the left lock/fail once during therapy.
And still no apparent reason for the ligament/tendon irritation.
Dazed and confused here. Any input would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

"Hi everyone 
I’ve been on this site many a times during my recovery for Ltkr on March 26/2018. I’ve had a hard time thus far thinking I would be past where I’m currently at.  I was released from my surgeon to go back to work. Started back yesterday ( I’m a retail banker) They have accommodated me with a chair but I work in a position that I’m more up than down. During the first month of post visits with my surgeon he said several times that most patients are past the pain , something I still had. He made me feel like there was something wrong with me. He referred me to a pain specialist. I’ve seen him 3 times now including my initial visit. The 3rd time was today after work. My ankle and knee both are swollen. This pain management doctor also said most people don’t have any problems or pain at my stage and suggested radio frequency genicular nerve ablation. Has anyone had this ? I cried in his office telling him that before the surgery I walked and felt better than I do now. When I initially went to my surgeon to have xrays done, he said both knees were bad, but wanted to start with the worse of the two. I have been favoring my ltkr and now my non operated knee is killing me. I’m a very outgoing and positive person generally but since this operation I am second guessing myself if I should have done it. I know we are all different in the healing process but I’m feeling desperate to get my old self back.
I’m sorry this is so long. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"I'm 13 wks post TKR,and haven't posted for a while. In the first  weeks of recovery I thought I would never be well again and what a huge mistake I'd made having the op. I ranted and cried on this forum about not getting enough bend,being so tired through lack of sleep and being a helpless emotional wreck!!!! The support and help I received here was the boost I needed and also told me I wasn't on my own on this path. My recovery was slow but with encouragement and tips from you all I kept going. 
    Now at 13 wks post op I'm well on that road to sanity and recovery, my swelling has gone down enormously, that tight band round the knee has improved so much that I only notice if I'm tired or done too much, I've learnt how to balance rest and exercise, my bend is a good 110 deg  I would have liked more but if that's the swap for no pain I'm fine with that. I still do the exercises and may yet get more bend.never say never. I'm walking mostly without my stick but use it when needed as I'm having my right knee done soon as it is very bad. I wanted to give back to this forum for those at the early stages that recovery does come and it won't take forever. I can't thank everyone on here enough fo their support. OFG , Shirley, Joan,Cheryl,sueisobel, Donna, Irish Linda,martinarvelo,lou1962, and all the rest of you guys out there, I thank you for your love and support throughout. Life is on the up!!!!!

"Yes I have been thru this 5 times already along with various other surgeries all on the same knee. I know what to expect I am aware it will be a roller coaster ride thru the recovery process there will be times the pain is going to be unreal and there will be times it will be at a dull roar. Therapy at first is going to be very painful at first ( it always is following a knee surgery ). My L knee has been thru too much and I am sure I can write a whole lot more but as it stands and its getting worse I am nervous and this is why, this will be the 6th replacement overall the 18th surgery I am quite sure I am thoroughly sick of having a knee surgery every 2 to 3 years. Dealing with pain everyday not being able to do things having to go to therapy. I am so worried that something will go wrong its driving me nuts for those that are going thru this and its your first time its hard to imagine the time and effort it takes to get better the days weeks months that every single day it flat out hurts I can understand the frustration the misery the pain I get it now put yourselves in my shoes this will be # 6 and it does not get any easier it more then likely gets worse in that recovery takes even longer. It may seem things are okay but I am quite scared worried and god knows how many other things are crossing my mind as Monday gets closer.

"Hi TKR people! So, I was quite surprised by the amount of pain post-op. I also was not as ""twilight"" state as hoped and heard the banging and sawing. Carpentry on my leg.Anyhow the drugs made me feel awful and the pain was quite intense for the first few weeks. Now I am back in my own home (used a Retirement home for few weeks) and just finished the 12 allowed physio appointments at the hospital. I have 0/115 ROM and really want more - I grew up hyper-extended and had incredible flexibility. I am finding that I am stiffer this week than last..walking a bit peg-legged and achy too. Pain at night still wakes me but better. I use Tylenol and Curcumin but really don't want the other drugs - they make me feel sick.I think I need more guidance on exercises and probably need a gym - not just my stretching and quad/hamstring stuff. My other knee is NG - but the thought of going through that pain and the post-op crazies is very daunting. I am open to advice and hope I will be brave enough next year to do the other one. Now how do I increase my ROM!!!

"5 months ago, Feb this year, I tore my ACL as well as my quad tendon, partially, due to dislocation of right patella. Previously dislocated the same patella 3 times prior over 12 years led me to lead a more static lifestyle which led to weight gain. Although, I have been in the process of changing my lifestyle completely, living a more active life, having lost 7kg/14lbs up to the point of injury.
Other health issues: Asthma, PCOS
My question, or at least discussion, is what can I do or how can I motivate myself to eat wiser whilst currently still on crutches and a leg brace this long into recovery? And, what exercises can you recommend, besides isometric exercises, to speed my recovery? At the moment I have been pushing my knee down into the bed whilst sat up on the bed, aiming for a leg raise, as I still cannot do one, I have been doing knee ups stood up, squeezing my quad/knee/calf, squeezing glutes, up to 5 times a day. Followed by a rest day if it starts to hurt. If it doesn't hurt, I just carry on.
Unfortunately, I am a very impatient person (and, yes, maybe I need to learn some lessons to not move at 100mph), but considering, I am just eager to get back on my feet, so I can get back to achieving my weight loss goals.
I led quite an active lifestyle, working 5-6 days a week, incorporating workouts 3/4 times a week, eating more wholefoods and making better food choices to aid weight loss, and doing so well and being happy with it to then go to bedbound for 5 months (couldn't put barely any weight on my leg until about 2/3 months into recovery)/being off work for so long/deteriorating mental health/making poor food choices.
Currently: 23, 5""4, 250lbs
Before injury (5 months ago) : 23, 5""4, 227lbs

"Today I am officially in the single digits. My surgery is scheduled for Jun 18th. Has anyone ever noticed Mondays as a rule stink well here is another example!! Trying to make smoe light on it so here is my line of thinking ( this is nonsense!! ) June 18th surgery 18 is the total number of times my L knee has been operated on, 2018 for the year. !8 might be good luck?? Since this is # 6 for knee revisions all on the same L knee I have no illusions on what to expect. The surgeon thinks I will be in the hospital 3 days ( my average is 5 ) I will not be able to drive for a month. During the month my blood will be monitored since I will be on blood thinners and I will have a therapist come by 2 to 3 X a week to help get my knee moving again. More than likely I will have those stylish compression stockings on that help with the prevention of blood clots even better here in Va in the summer it gets hot and humid wont I look cool? By the end of July I will be released from home health care and will be able to drive and I am sure driving to out patient therapy is going to be about it. What is good at least for me where I will go to therapy is less then 2 miles away close is good. I am going to be in the same mode as everyone else the pain is going to really make life miserable I may complain when walking now after the surgery just trying to walk to my living room is going to be no fun. One thing is for sure it will take time I have no illusions on that in fact due to the amount of surgeries my knee has had I would not be surprised if the healing takes longer. 
This post if nothing else helps me in away deal with whats coming yes I have been thru it and yes I know what to expect and I am sure I have a great surgeon but I keep second guessing will this be it or will I have to repeat this mess all over again?? I may joke about this but in reality I am nervous and somewhat scared as well. So hopefully things will turn out okay??

"Yesterday at about 4 in the afternoon I was walking at the park. The park has many concrete benches that all have sharp corners for some reason. I was walking away from the mini water park at a decently fast pace and my knee slammed into the corner. I took several minutes before I could walk again with less pain. It's been 28 hours and I can walk with minimal pain, but anytime I rest it for more than a few minutes there's a shooting pain with any movement. Walking only induces an ache. There was swelling within seconds and a lovely bruise. I've tried both ice and heat compression as well as anti inflammatory. I don't want to waste money going to a doctor if I can do something myself. Any advice?

"Hello I'm 55 had tkr 4 years agao. Was in therapy for 1 year 3 months. Had a manipulation on the knee 2 month after original surgery. During physical therapy I got to 114 degree bend but everytime the push to 120 I went backwards and started to 80 degrees again. Did this 3 times and at the 4th time I only recovered to 100 degree. I was released from therapy cause they cant do anything more. Now to present time 4 years later my band has dropped below 90 degrees. Went back to doctor and they say I have three choices. 1 do it all again not recommended. 2 have an orthoscopic surgery and have scare tissue burned and remove and start therapy to get some bend back. No guaranteed it will work. 3 do nothing and live with the lack of bend. I am very active and enjoy the outside life. Want at least to ride a bike. What should I do. Must decide by the 21 June 18.

"Hi everyone! I'm 21 weeks BTKR and my knees seem to doing great. But about 3 weeks ago my right foot (the middle of the heel) started hurting. Now I'm limping around and can't be on my feet for very long and have to go sit down like before my surgery. I found out I have a heel spur. I'm so bummed. I was making such good progress and now this!  This happens to be on the stronger leg that I abused by using it more to compensate for my much weaker left leg. But now both legs are much stronger since my surgery and exercises. So I can see why my right foot might be rebelling.

"I hope and pray that by Gods grace, that nobody in the rest of the world has had to go through these issues. If you are one to believe that no doctor in his right mind would  leave packing in my knee that would cause 4 different surgery's, 4 different infections, ending in MRSA, going septic, My patella had to be removed because after 3 months after surgery, the wet, infected packing laid on top of the Patella which was submersed in MRSA and killed the bone. The Femur and Tibia are all necrotic. NO way to solve this except above the knee amputation in 3 weeks. Attorneys have all the proof they need to file negligence but its too expensive to fight for just 1 million malpractice MAX. I was a professional Baseball Umpire on my way to the big leagues, THATS OVER. I had fell down a step and detached my patella. Simple surgery for 99% of good doctors. My doctor and his wife were on the show ""Married to Medicine', multi millionaires that left me high and dry, broke, and CRIPPLED. YEA I AM P****D....

"Well I cant believe I’ve got this far from the first 6 weeks where I could hardly move my knee and I’m thinking ‘what have I done’!!!
I have worked my socks off, from knee lunges to squats to cycling, swimming, power walking, standing on 1 leg (bad knee) and taking the dog for a walk and anything else that has been thrown at me.
I have never been a great gym person but have found that if I want to get better and back to normal you have to put the work in.
When I first saw my physio my knee bend was 84 then it went to 105, then 110 and now it’s 118 degrees.
I can go up and down stairs, power walk and now learning to run again. Knee still weak so it’s more like a crab running.
Anyway guys what I’m telling you all is, we have to put the work in if we want to get back to living life to the full and not limp around like monkeys.
Dont forget to Ice knee after all exercise and if it aches try Nurofen plus.
When I get into bed at night I find Voltorol very good, rub in and around knee and also the back of the knee and leg, but not over the scar.

"Hi I am so thankful to everyone of you sharing your comments. I have been goin really well with yoga, walking, e bike I just bought.  A slip of 6 degree on the lower knee replacement and results in a full knee replacement in September 2018. 
I use Nordic sticks while walking . They are wonderful. I have been using them for nearly 10 years before my knee problems. 
I do yoga and if you can try and learn chair shoulder stand. Read on line the benefits. Plenty. It helps swelling come down.

"Hello: I am almost to week 5 of my tkr of my right knee. I’m done with home pt and next week I start outpatient therapy. My knee is still so tight that it feels like a small rubber band over my knee that won’t stretch enough to allow bending. My straightening is only 95 to 100 but my bending measures 125. Is this tightness normal? There is still some swelling. And also feels like I’ve pulled a muscle.  When I walk. I am sleeping better at night. Not so uncomfortable but when i get up I am so stiff its hard to take a step. Trying not to be depressed but it’s hard sometimes. Anyone else have these problems at 4 1/2 weeks?

"i am now 7 weeks post T K R.
Went to see physiotherapist last Monday and got discharged after seeing how i was walking and watch me go up and down stairs,
They said i could drive but to wait until i have seen the consultant which was last Thursday.
She said after examining my knee that i could drive but only short distances at first.
After the first 3 weeks which can only be described as hell on earth i am now able to get around and even went up some step ladders the other day.
I find if i am on it for a long time it does get very stiff but this is expected after such a major op.
I still find it a bit clunky at times and the consultant said its normal.
I have had to work hard to get to this point but the hard work has paid off.
Ido have some arthritis in my other knee but nowhere as bad as the one i had replaced which has not been good for a while due to a bad motorcycle accident in the 70s even the surgeon described it as horrendous.

"I'm 9 months post op TKR and have been suffering from pain all over (not just the knee) and I have been in pain since before my surgery. Went to a rheumatologist because my pain doctor felt there was something else going on and she put me on 15mg pred daily. I felt like a new person! I felt like I was 20 again, energy, no pain, good mood. I felt wonderful! BUT, I did not like the jittery effects of the pred or the hunger and I know it's not a drug you can be on long term. I've tapered down and am now on 5mg/daily and damn! I feel like s**t again. I started feeling pain all over as soon as I tapered down to 10mg/day. I don't want to go back on pred but I so desperately want to feel pain free again. My father is taking diclofenac sodium 100mg daily and he says it works like a miracle. I've heard horror stories of its side effects but want to ask my pain doctor for a prescription. I'm going on a family vacation to New Orleans in a couple of weeks and I want to enjoy it pain free. Does anyone have any experience with this medication? I don't want the topical because my pain is EVERYWHERE not just my knee. Any input would be very helpful. I'm still waiting for all the tests done by my rheumatologist but as of now I am negative of any auto immune diseases.

I told him after going thru this 5X I feel lots of pain so please keep that in mind when I need pain meds. He said I will be in the hospital 3 days ? and after 3 months I should be feeling better. I agree but I am not going to feel like a million dollars either it is still going to be sore and at times painful. After I was done with him had some more labs done and given some stuff to start 5 days prior to surgery to prevent infection. Not too much longer 11 days from now I will be in bed with my knee all wrapped up. Fun Fun!!

"I'm not very impressed with the sliding caliper/protractor thing they use to measure ROM. It is very subjective to the user. I had mine measured at 85 deg and zero straight yesterday and today it was the same but measured by a different physio as 90 and 110 ! This is generally because there is no standard point of reference on the outside or inside of the knee so it is very easy to get several degrees difference depending on how it is lined up. Okay as a guide but as a retired scientist I can see it is flawed in getting reproducible results especially between different users.

"Hi, some of you may remember me from my various contributions around 18 months ago. I had a TKR postponed due to AF and then a gall bladder issue!! The knee got done reasonably successfully and eventually the gall bladder was removed with great success.
I am now in that dreaded second week of my second TKR (12days). Seems to be worse than other though I thought it would be better. Maybe because my AF means that because I am on an anti-coagulant I can no longer have Ibuprofen to supplement the Co-Codomel. That's all I've got with Gabapentene which is about to end. Despite the worse aching generally my biggest issue is a tight and quite painful calf muscle which is tender when prodded and this massive pins and needles cum burning pain down my knee and back of calf on first standing. Does ease after a couple of minutes but I know it is making me get up less. Exercises painful at this stage but just about coping. It is the sharp pain in my calf that is worrying me and hindering me at his stage. Anyone else had this? The nurses and doctors don't think it's DVT but I'm not convinced although I've never had it.

"Hi. This is my second knee to have a partial medial replacement and has been so much more bother than the first, and that was bad enough! So it fits in with the saying every knee is different. My problem is my second  knee which is almost 3 months now is very itchy with a rash, it does seem to be worse at night. I was allergic to the internal sutures in the beginning where the sutures were pushing out of the scar (like a volcano!). At six weeks my surgeon said no antibiotics necessary as my body was doing what it was designed to do and it would settle. That of course did settle as the scar healed. But the itching hasn't gone away.
My question is has anyone else experienced this itching? I have tried antihistamines and different creams thinking at first it was the Vitamin E cream, which I didn't use the first time. I stopped everything for several days and it has not got any better, if anything slightly worse. It drives me mad but more worrying is if it is linked to the replacement part.
The knee is warm but at 3 months I would expect this its not overly hot. Not red just covered in a pink rash.
My GP who I saw for an ear infection recently was unconcerned, to the point of rudeness really.
I am just looking for answers.
Thankyou

"Backstory: I was mowing the yard and for no reason that I could tell, I felt my knee crunch, There was no pain or swelling, so I finished mowing the yard, then the next day I felt unstability and some pain on the outside of my knee.
Now the problem is, for the most part I don't experience much pain, except for some nagging slight pain in the joint just outside of the knee cap. But, whats worse, is everytime I sit for any period of time, as soon as I get up to walk, my knee feels unstable almost like the lower leg is loose at the joint. After a short amount of walking my knee will finally pop then my knee and leg feel stable and I feel safer to walk a longer distance. I have full range of motion and no clicking in the knee under normal walking. What I have noticed though is if I duck walk my knee clicks with every step, which is followed by pain on the outside of the knee. 
I am going to the dr this week, but for now I am just curious if anyone has experienced anything like this and what was the problem. I have scoured the internet but have been unsuccessful in finding out any information.

The problem is that my kneecap rests too high on my leg- I also have loose joints to begin with- and the result is unwanted and constant pain when I try to do any activity (longboarding, climbing stairs, etc.) that requires a lot of knee power. Among these problems however, the WORST is that my kneecap slides out of place when my leg, knee, foot, ankle is moved in a way that causes my patella to 'slide' or 'pop' out of place. This happens on both knees and is the worst in the winter because of ice and other slippery surfaces plus the addition of the cold weather which seems to make my knee problems worse. This started happening to me a few years before puberty and has plagued and haunted my anxious mind for years.
At first, my knee problems weren't too bad and when my kneecap popped out of place, it would usually pop back when I straightened my leg. It also didn't occur very often either. I honestly don't remember specific times that my knee went out very often, and when I do it's usually because it was something I never wanted to happen again.
I've always been in ballet. I started when I was four or five and didn't stop until I was about 15. I always had problems in class, but my ballet teachers learned what was happening when I fell and a few tears and an ice pack later I was usually good as new, and the injuries weren't too terrible either. But, one year during my ballet school's annual Nutcracker performance, I was taking my position for our first dance and when I went to step on my leg, my kneecap slid out of place and I fell on it while it was still out. It was terrifying. The way I had fallen caused my patella to stay out of place for longer than normal. And I couldn't walk. Along with the humiliation of falling on stage, I was haunted by thoughts of something even worse happening. Long story short, I required physical therapy and this terrible incident took months to overcome both mentally and physically.
This was the worst it ever was.
But middle school was equally terrible. I wasn't very pretty, or popular and everyone called me weird and strange (and I was hehe). I'd also lost my closest friends to the popular people... But that's another story. It was a really hard time for me and it was a really, really bad place too. Even still, I did really well in my classes, but of course, my knees embarrassed me on a regular basis and the kids would laugh whenever I fell because of my kneecap. This made me cry a lot. No one understood why I fell or how painful and limiting my problem was.
High school was, er, nah, I don't need to tell you. The main idea is that this has been a continuous problem that is unrelenting. And over the years the pain and swelling is more easily provoked by everyday activity. When people laughed at me, it made me feel furious and defeated because I knew that those people laughing at me were in perfect health, no joint problems, no sympathy. Not that I wanted sympathy. I just wanted people to understand that it was out of my control and agonizing.
The reason I decided to write this was because I fell in my dance class a few days ago and kind of had a minor break down because of it. I felt the weight of this burden bearing down on my heart, I just felt helpless, hopeless, like I could never accomplish the things I wanted to because my knee problems limit me so much.
I'm writing this because I'm sure that someone out there has a problem similar to me and needs someone to understand how hard it is. And I'm hoping that after reading this, even if you can't relate to my predicament, that you have more maturity than my middle school buddies and make sure that people are okay before pointing and laughing.

"I'll make long story short! So basically I had multiple dislocations throughout my teenage years which led to me having a arthroscopic surgery which did nothing, So I had a TTO, MPFL reco & lateral release just shy of my 18th birthday boy that was fun. It all went well, Now i'm 24 and my patella has started to pop out when I straighten my knee and get caught before shooting back in when I bend it back down. So i've been booked in for another MPFL reconstruction as my graft has failed, Plus i'm getting my screws removed from my TTO.
My surgeon mentioned I'll be right to walk after the op however I can use crutches. He never mentioned if I'll have a brace or not is bracing normal for this procedure alone?
Also because he has already taken a graft out of my knee hes going to take the graft out of my opposite knee for it & I was wondering what that's like? 
My biggest concern is what if this fails what can be done then?

"I’ve had constant knee pain for about six months. It gets puffy on the sides. When I look at web sites that describe the different types of knee injuries, it sounds like bursitis. I haven’t seen a doctor yet because I’m not sure what they can do. I’m afraid of strong pain meds but also tired of not being able to do the things I want, like hiking with my grandkids. I’d appreciate any suggestions. Thanks

"Hi
I am 10 weeks post rtkr. I have good days and some not good days. I went to my pt on Thursday and the best at this point for rom is 104. I still have some pain and numbness on half my knee. I feel like I’m carringing a led weight in my knee.  My problem is, I’m pretty exhausted most of my days. I’ve asked this question awhile ago but thought I would be past the exhaustion at this point. I take over the counter B12. I’m excited to get back to work on June 18th but am wanting my old energy back. Is anybody experiencing this?

"Called my Dr. to see if he had any ideas on how I can feel better, pain meds are not an option since it would interfere with surgery. As I thought I was right but the good news at least for me I am scheduled for surgery June 18th. It looks like my labs are okay he is still waiting on one he said it takes 2 weeks for something show up culture wise but he feel comfortable I should be okay. 
This is pretty screwed up on my part no one looks forward to surgery and here I am I think its great mostly because I cannot stand the way my knee feels constantly.

"Has your ortho ever suggested ""iovera"" prior to knee surgery? Apparently, it provides pain relief and or reduces the amount of narcotics post surgery. It freezes the nerves for 2-3 months while they go thru the process of regenerating. I saw my ortho yesterday for possible loosening of my implant (19 months post TKR), numbness and pain L. knee and he brought iovera up. I am now going thru the routine work up scheduled to check for infection via lab work, bone scan, and EMG to see if there is nerve entrapment.

Mine was bone on bone my right knee was great no problems my second one is great except for pain on the bone on my left side of my leg especially at night I do my excercises but some how this knee seems different I can't put my finger on it but when I went to physio they were pleased but he said my bones were deformed and the surgeon has done his best to straighten it, I'm a bit concerened and wondered why that's what is causing me the pain, I'm glad I fought to get mine done as I don't have the pain when I walk now of them being bone on bone I'm just taking each day as it comes.

"I know the common reply might be ""go to a doctor"", but all my family is in medicine and I have usually been pretty good at figuring myself out, but this issue has me puzzled.  
I was a former track sprinter/jumper/etc.  I am late 30s but usually stay active.  I have not ran in about a year.  I got back to it and started getting knee pain directly under my patella, and some pain just above it.  My knee is not what I would call unstable, and I have minimal pain walking, but the BIG trigger is stepping up a step!!  About 15* bend and try to load up my leg, OUCH....  however, I was able to successfully do some lighter weight squats tonight with minimal pain.  Once the angle goes beyond 15*, the pain decreases.  I can also sprint if I need to, though my knee does not like it.  Seems to get inflamed.  
I may have caused an injury to the knee last year however.  I kicked a football and I believe hyperextended it .  I did not feel any pop, but instant and crippling pain, though the pain went away in about 10min and I was able to walk home.  It scared me, as the first thought in my head was ""this is it, surgery is in my future""....
I would say my quads have atrophied more than I want to admit and I know my legs need rebuilt but I need to get this knee to work with me on this.  
Anyone have any thoughts in diagnosis, rehab, exercises that will help me?  I was thinking to try patellar taping but not sure that will help.

"Hi all.
I apologize for the length of this post but I am really upset - barely slept last night.  I am hoping that those of you who have gone through this (and those that haven't) can provide some insight and advice.
I have been in alot of pain (with swelling) since my TKR in May of last year and subsequent MUA in August.  Even pain management has not been 100 % effective. While I have always felt the implant moving in my knee for the last couple of months everytime I move it I feel/hear it ""thudding"" - the only way I can describe it. The pain has also increased and I also developed numbing in the lateral part of the knee and the toes on the outside of my foot.  In addition for the past week or so I have had burning in the joint area and sometimes over my entire knee.
Given the above I made an appointment with a new ortho surgeon because I was not especially happy with my original surgeon.  After examining my knee he felt that the implant was loose but ordered blood work (sed rate and C reactive protein) and a MARS MRI to rule out infection and for a better picture of the implant prior to scheduling revision surgery.  I was able to view my lab results online which indicated the below:
Sed rate 46 mm/h - high ( in range is <OR=30 mm/h
C-reactive protein 11.3 - high (in range is < 8.0 mg/L
So I called the dr. to make an appointment after June 1 for insurance reasons and asked if it was ok to wait this long given the out of range lab results.  I was told that he wanted to see me sooner rather than later.  So I went to see him on May 24th.
At the time of the visit he told me that I had an infection which would require the two stage surgery - the first to implant a cement spacer with antibiotics followed by at least 6 weeks of IV antibiotics via a picc line and the second for the actual revision.  He also told me that he would not aspirate at this time to determine the type of infection because he did not feel it prudent to do so and that this would be done at the time of the surgery at which point the type of infection would be identified and the proper antibiotic prescribed.  He also said that I must have a really good immune system as he was surprised that the infection has not caused sepsis.  I should mention that he had not yet received the results of the MARS MRI which I found really surprising given that I had had it a week and a half before my appointment and while he may not have had the CD of the images the hospital where I had it should have faxed the report. He did not seem too concerned that he did not have this report but did say he needed it prior to surgery.
He did not feel I should wait 6 months for the first surgery but also did not feel it urgent enough to get it done a.s.a.p.  When the surgical coordinator came in to schedule my first surgery I got the first available date of 7/6.  At that time she told me that if the doctor felt the infection was really serious he would have immediately sent me to the ER as he had done with other patients,
I was telling one of my friend about this and she got really angry telling me that the doctor was full of crap.  That while my labs were slightly elevated that this was not indicative of an infection and that if I really had one the results would be in the thousands.  She was basing this on what her lab results were regarding a thyroid condition that while elevated was told by her doctor that they would have had to have been in the hundreds to correlate to this particular condition.  She also said that there was no way my immune system had anything to do with me becoming septic and that there was no danger of that because she went through it with her husband who had a brain aneurysm and after his last surgery developed it and subsequently died when he went into septic shock.  She thought the doctor was using this as a scare tactic and that if he really felt that I had an infection he would not allow me to wait 6 weeks for surgery,  She then said that while she thinks I do have a problem with the implant that she does not think I have an infection or I would be really sick and that the only reason he wanted to do the two stage revision was to make money not caring about what I would have to go though.  Lastly, she said I need to get a second opinion.
I just think that she is projecting her experience with her husband onto my condition which is comparing apples to oranges as her husband's was extremely dire from the start.  I also think she has a general distrust for doctors which is further clouding her judgement,
I know none of us are doctors but I was hoping someone could answer my below questions based upon their experience:
If you have gone through this did your doctor aspirate your joint to confirm that you actually had an infection before scheduling surgery?
If not were you placed on any type of antibiotic before surgery to try to eradicate the infection prior to having the surgery to insert the spacer with antibiotics?.
Did you have the above labs and do you recall how high your results were and whether the results would have been extremely high if in fact an infection was present.
After the first surgery were you mobile with just a spacer in your knee - could you get around with a walker or crutches?
Were you in alot of pain afterwards?
Did you have a picc line for the antibiotics to be administered or did you have a regular IV?
Anything else I should know about the first surgery and then the actual revision surgery?
Laslty, do you think there is ANY validity in what my friend is saying and should I listen to her?
Thank you so much for any input on this,  I really appreciate it!

"Hi everyone 
I am in my 9th week today LTKR.  I wanted to ask if anyone is having problems with energy. I read so many stories on this site but never see anything about the loss of energy. Before this surgery it was hard to keep me down with work and running errands on my days off.  I went to my family doctor 2weeks ago to have blood drawn since I’m so tired all the time. Tests came back normal but doctor said I’m a bit low on vitamin b12. She advised to take over the counter vitamins until I get in to see her for a b12 shot. She didn’t seem to concerned.  Any advice on this would be helpful.

"I was playing football with my little son a week ago and with a sudden move heard the “unpopular” and laud “pop” in my knee and felt a sharp pain in the outer/back of my knee (LCL?). The pain was quite bad for the first few minutes but then kind off settled and I could walk with a limp…
By the evening it was swollen but didn´t hurt as much as I was expected it to… (I did have a bad knee injury 10 years ago – ACL & MCL grade III tear, same knee). Now, the knee is still swollen and is more numb than painful. I do walk with a limp, sometime I feel sharp pain in other parts of the knee but not in the place where it originally “popped” and hurt…
I do not have any problems with stability of the knee (but I didn´t have when I first injured my knee neither).
It´s very uncomfortable numb pain (as if the inside wouldn´t fit and the knee is about to explode)…. has anyone else had something similar? Does it sound like something more serious?

"A week away from my first TRK anniversary. Its not been fun and despite two MUA's my ROM remains (and I suspect always will) at 90 degrees.
Having ridden my first motorcycle 40 years ago (54 now), I have been fairly confident throughout my TKR year that my motorcycling days were over, as my poor ROM wouldn't allow me to get my foot where it needed to be, on the footrest. A few times Ive shuffled into the garage, climbed aboard and then struggled to get off with a heavy heart and a pointless leg.
So as not to bore anyone any further (as this is somewhat of a selfish post), I bought a matching seat for my bike from a breaker and took a bread knife and saw to it, the thinking being that the further back I can get by a**e, the less bend I will need from my knee.
Last week I took the butchered seat to a local upholsterer and collected it this morning.
Just fitted it to my bike and rode it all of 5m down my drive.
A VERY uplifting and liberating moment after 12 months of TKR unpleasantness. Also walking unaided for 40 mins a day, having lost the limp, which I couldn't have done 8 weeks ago. And the sun is shining.......
Things do get better, its just hard to imagine it !!

"Well if any of you have been following along with my threads and posts I have mentioned I am going to need another surgery. I finally heard back from the Dr. he reviewed my lab results but he still feels ( maybe its a gut feeling ?? ) I may have an infection. Yesterday afternoon he called me and he wants me to see him Thursday morning to have some fluid taken out to be checked. I think he mentioned something about white blood cell count?? Based on the findings ( and boy do I hope there is no infection !!! ) I am looking at 2 options. The easy one fingers crossed no infection then I just need a revision however if there is an infection ( life will suck ) I will need 2 surgeries. The first one he needs to take out the current prosthesis and put a spacer in and I will have to have a PICC line for the antibiotics 2X a day for 6 weeks. ( I have had one before these are absolutely no fun period ). After the 6 weeks the spacer comes out and the hopefully last prosthesis goes in. So pretty much my summer is almost over it all depens on the lab results and when I can have the surgery.

"I'm a long-time tennis player / coach who has had an occasional bout of left knee stiffness  a few times a year during cold weather (post 1984 skiing knee twist). After taking up cycling on a serious level (2010), there have been ZERO issues...That is, until I spent a week on my hands and knees painting the outer/roof portion of my pergola. I also started playing a new, knee-intensive sport, pickleball over the summer...No problems with that, however.
SYMPTOMS BEGAN AFTER CRAWLING ON HANDS AND KNEES 2-4 hrs/day over the course of about 5-7 days.
I experience varying levels of pain intensity from level 1 (waking in the morning) to level 9/10 ""tooth-achy"" (debilitated/difficulty walking) after light on-court activity for 1-2 hrs.
 have been in PT for one month with minimal improvement. My 2015 X-ray of the left knee reveals an ""excellent looking joint"" (according to my ortho).
I was poking around the pain site (1/2 mid to lateral section of left knee) and discovered a node-like structure- later determined by the PT to be the peroneal/fibular nerve - I made my diagnosis, ""peroneal nerve entrapment..."" 
Here's the weird part: Whereas PNE typically has sensory & motor abnormalities (tingling, numbness, burning, drop-foot, etc), I experience NONE of these, ONLY PAIN AND STIFFNESS!!! I have normal range of motion.. No electric shock, no tingling, no burning, no numbness. Is this Voodoo LOL?
Weight bearing activities cause the most debilitation.
Also getting up from sitting position and upon extension. Cycling causes minimal problems.In fact, I can cycle all day. But, I stand on the tennis court for an hour and I'm DONE!
I have an appointment with my orthopedist in two weeks, who will probably order an MRI, but, like many of us here, inquiring minds want to know ASAP!
Thanks in advance for your time and attention!

"Hello, it will be a year on June 7 that I had both knees replaced.  One knee has done very well.  The other knee has the same bend but  there is scar tissue that almost feels like a tight hot wire wrapped around my knee.  My surgeon keeps saying, give it time.

"Hello, it will be a year on June 7 that I had both knees replaced.  One knee has done very well.  The other knee has the same bend but  there is scar tissue that almost feels like a tight hot wire wrapped around my knee.  My surgeon keeps saying, give it time.

"I am now 10 weeks from the and getting much better. Not sure what my numbers are but at last Dr ck he said 130 bend but couldn't straighten totally. With tops from Chico and others I can almost lock my knee straight.
Now the real reason for this post...my 50 yr old niece is having tkr July 17 and her doctor told her she should be able to go back to work as a special needs teacher on Aug 17! I am so upset. I think she is going to be very disappointed. Has anyone here returned to work in 4 weeks? Can you drive in 4 weeks?
I want to guide her to this site but It would not be appreciated. I guess I'll wait until after her surgery.

"For the most part I try to be upbeat however today is not one of them. You know your day is going to stink you wake up in pain and as the day progresses it just gets worse. My only glimmer of hope is the specialist calls me back soon ( yesterday was good ) and says I need further testing or he needs more tests done. I hate waiting I absolutely hate being in pain I hate my ( fill in the blanks ) --- ---- knee. Most everyone here will more then likely be okay after a period of time a few might wind up like me ( hopefully no one!! ) but I get so jealous when I think of it.

"12 weeks post op. At 10 weeks I visited the GP who was concerned about my general health but happy with the knee. Had blood tests and discovered I was very low on Vitamin D ( should be 50, I was 18). Given a course of high potency Vitamin D.
Symptoms of low Vitamin D are: fatigue, pain in bones and muscle, depression and impaired bone healing. 
Hopefully after these have kicked in I should be feeling better. Thought I would share.

"Among the causes of knee pain are injuries to the cartilage that sustains the knee, sprained ligaments that will not turn back to its regular form and firmness, a torn muscle, knee joint being dislocated, an inflammation of the cartilage that leads to arthritis, being overweight, and other chronic diseases. The symptoms are not limited to constant pain. Oftentimes there is an obvious swelling, redness, burning sensation, a sharp and shooting feeling of pain when it is being used, numbness, and difficulty in walking or even standing up.

" I had my kneecap replacement in Oct. 2017 (7months ago) and found it to be a very hard recovery. My bend and extension are great but I have constant pain around the knee. Now I am getting severe pain going up my thigh as well. I am also told that in my sleep I sporadically kick out ONLY my right leg at least 15 times in the night. That’s the same leg I had the kneecap replacement on. I never did this prior to the surgery. I would like to know if anyone else is having this much pain or the leg kicks this long after surgery. I cannot just get up and walk right away either. 
Sometimes my leg hyperextends and it is painful. I just want to be normal and have my life back!  I used to drive a big school bus for a living but unfortunately it is my driving leg and I am no longer able to drive a school bus anymore so I am stressed about finding work on top of all this pain!!

Saying that I am nervous is an understatement, I think I am somewhat prepared for the worst case but still nerves of steel are now nerves of mush!! The implant part is not a big deal what scares me is fixing the bone loss. Will it be one surgery or two what about recovery etc ? So yes I have been thru TKR's scopes partials this is all new and right now I am as nervous as most of you when you went in for your TKR. I did decide depending on what the Specialist says it may be time for a few cold beers when I get home. Cold beer on a hot day to me it sounds like a good way to feel better depending on what I am told.

"Hello everyone I had a partical knee replacement 11weeks ago after years of being in pain which became worse and worse as the years went by . Probably the last couple of years my op I started walking funny turning my foot on the side which sort of helped with the pain of walking. Since the op my knee has healed nicely don't get to much pain from it I do get very tired after exercise and walking. The problem that I now Have is serve pain in my foot and ankle swollen alot of the time and when I have been out walking or standing for awhile became like a very heavy feeling. I did mention it to consultant at my 6 week check up he said that because of the way I walked and now my knee has been straighten this is why I have the problem. I go to a phisyo group once a week and the phisyo there has been very helpful and advised me to refer myself back to phisyo and hopefully will be referred to a podiatrist. I have lost alot of my confidence since my op and feel so unsteady when I'm out especially if on my own.

Surgery or ride it out?

I've had knee problems since I was around 10, with the first of 5 dislocations occurring when I was 10. The first time my knee buckled while I was standing and I just fell, no pain or swelling afterward, just a loud pop and I fell to the ground. The second time is a bit hard to explain, but someone jumped on my leg, not hard, but enough to slip my kneecap to the outside. The third time was a wrong twist, the fourth time was wrestling and the 5th and most recent time were walking into an object that hit the inside of my leg, pushing my kneecap to the outside. So my issue is that with all of these dislocations, I haven't ever had apparent swelling, only bruised once behind the knee. I've had 2 MRIs done, first, one after the wrestling event came back with a very small hairline fracture of the patella and a bone bruise. The second MRI was done last month about 1 year after the most recent dislocation and showed no change between the 2 injuries and only a very small change in cartilage, nothing significant enough to freak out about. I have tried physical therapy twice now. The first time I saw some improvement, the second time after the most recent injury I found no improvement and more lingering pain than before. I ran out of sessions covered by insurance so I stopped physical therapy and kept doing my exercises at home which I ended up stopping due to working two jobs and going to school full time. Now I am stuck with deciding between surgery or dealing with the issue and possible damage?
My current state of injury is a lingering pain when the weather changes, climbing steep stairs, random stabbing pains behind the kneecap and lingering soreness after any movement of the kneecap itself. I recently was sent to an orthopedic surgeon that has given me the option of MPFL surgery to basically tether the kneecap to lessen the likelihood of future excessive movement of the kneecap. He told me I have loose joints in my knees, not excessive but enough to possibly be the cause of the issue. I have only had the problem in my left knee though. I am so conflicted on getting the surgery or living with the issue.
I am a 20-year-old female, would it be better to get the surgery now when I'm younger or wait to see if I need the surgery in the future but possibly risk more damage???

"Up to 9 weeks post TKR it was an awful journey. All the symptoms a lot on here have experienced, nausea, extreme fatigue, lack of sleep and constant pain. Plus others. I had lost 16 pounds in weight. My husband took me to GP who sent me for tests but in the meantime prescribed Pregabalin to block nerves to relieve pain and aid sleep. 
Within 36 hours I felt so much better, nausea reduced considerably and sleeping for much longer periods. Appetite returned and energy levels boosted. Put 3 pounds back on. Now at 10 and half weeks post TKR.
However made the mistake of doing too much this week so ice and elevation.  Just thought I’d share as I know a lot on this forum are as down as I was and maybe these type of meds will help. I know I’ve still got a long way to go but my outlook now is more positive.

"Hi all could someone give me any idea or anyone who has been in the same situation what could be wrong with my son please? My son who is 15 and not very active has chronic pain in both knees now for 3 weeks. The first week he had the pain in all his one leg (which he described as a thumping squeezing kind of pain) and the knee on the other leg. then it went to his other knee so now it's both knees. (He don't get pain in his leg now) He gets pain in his knees  while sitting but made worse when walking or going up and down the stairs. He couldn't describe the pain at first but now he said it feels as though someone is jabbing their fingers in his knees. I've seen gp who said it was a strain and I've seen a different doctor who said it was osgood sclhatter disease which the hospital said he had when he was 11. I've saw a doctor in the hospital who said it's not osgood where he is getting the pain he  has referred him to a bone specialist and I've even made a appointment for physio. He has had a lot of pain in his legs when he was younger I always thought it was growing pains he is small for his age. But this pain is affecting his walking is it normal for pain in the knees to last this long it don't seem to be getting any better.

"i just went past my 1year Anniversary Feb 21st.  I was looking at some of my posts from last year,  I remember being so discouraged that I couldn’t bend my knee to the 120 PT wanted.  I walked out of there crying many times because I was so afraid of the manual adjustment,  my surgeon kept telling me that I was doing fine but I got into a competitive thing with other people who were walking, bending that knee to 120,throwing away the cane after a week, not taking painkillers,  whew, lots to live up to. 
  Then it finally all came together, I could bend that knee to 120and beyond, didn’t need pain killers, I was out walking the cane and tripping on it so I discarded that.  
   So if you’re new to this please don’t be discouraged.  You will get to where YOU are supposedly to be.  No one else feels what you feel so keep your exercises up faithfully, ice like crazy, move around a lot, you can’t hurt this titanium knee,  I was exercising the other day and it felt so strong.  
   You will heal and get better.  Please, chin-up

I'm in my mid 50s. Unfortunately due to bad arthritis, no cartilage a damaged meniscus and a dislocated knee cap I was given no option but a TKR. The surgeon wants to do the MUA under a general and says I should be on crutches for a couple of days then back to ""normal"". Can anyone that has had it done at this stage let me know how it was for them as two people I know who have had this done were certainly not back to normal after two days!

"[color=#222222]A month ago (April 6), I was at work when one of my kids (I'm a preschool teacher) basically charged into me and made me stumble backwards about 12ft with them in my arms before falling. I had immediate pain, but I could still walk and everything...but I decided to go to urgent care anyway. They took x-rays, no bone damage, said to followup with orthopedist.[/color]When I saw the orthopedist, he initially thought that it was an MCL sprain, so he put me in a brace, ordered PT and said come back in 4-6 weeks. Meanwhile, my knee didn't stop hurting, and I couldn't work...so I called again and got in to see the ortho a second time. This time he immediately ordered an MRI. Saw him today and he came in and said that the MRI showed a meniscus tear and that I would need surgery.He said there are 2 surgical options, but he won't know which he'll do until he's in there (both are arthroscopic procedures)...and one sounds like nbd, and the other sounds like it would really suck. The one that sounds like nbd he said is what happens 95% of the time which is just that they shave the torn part off. The second one, the 5% chance involves an actual repair and that would keep me off my feet and out of work for 6 weeks...and I've already been out for 4. He also said that the shaving is better short-term, but the repair is better long-term, but he can't say which he'll do now because he needs to see the tissue and exactly what's going on before he decides.Anyone else been in this boat? He said that for now I'm cleared to go back to work, part time (my choice -- he asked if I thought I could go back or not) and do pretty much whatever I want, no restrictions, until we can schedule the surgery. (It has to be approved by the workers comp board). This makes me super happy since I've been dying to work again, but it also makes me super nervous because what if I make the tear worse? He doesn't seem worried that that'll happen, and if I decide that work is too much I can always go back and get a note to excuse me...but am I right or wrong to be worried about making the tear worse?He also had me in a brace but he said that I don't need to be wearing it anymore because he didn't think it was one that would do much good (I agree) -- but should I be in a brace of sorts?

"Had TKR March 26th 2018  I’m not due back to work till early June.  So far I’ve still have a deep achy pain in my knee especially the inner knee area. I get around the house most days doing dishes and a few other chores in spite of the pain.  I’m going back to work at the beginning of June where I usually stand for 8 hours. They will accommodate me with a chair but my job responsibilities require me to get up and down.  Would it be advisable to wear a knee brace of some sort during this time?  I go to PT twice a week. My ROM is only 106. I am able to use a full rotation on the stationary bike.  I have a Dr appointment in 2 days and am afraid of what the Dr is going to say regarding my rom. I feel I’m never going to get past all this pain. I don’t sleep well and I feel my happiness has been taken away.  I try and stay positive but it’s hard when you have this constant nagging pain! I’m taking gabapentin 300 mg 3 times a day, hydrocodine up to five a day, meloxicam 1 per day.

"It seems that I keep moving backwards.  I had pkr in July, did all my exercises, and rom was good.  I could do 30 minutes of mild laps, eased into walking my 10,000 steps, and was able to ride my bike everyday.  Also continued with my quad exercises everyday.  I have never been totally pain free, but did feel some improvement.  Three weeks ago, I was 10 minutes into my swim and felt a twinge in my knee.  Stopped right away.  I was unable to put any weight on it.  I have seen two ortho docs.  First one said my pkr surgeon messed up and I need revision.  Clearly, I am not ready to accept that.  Second doc has ordered MRI on lumbar as it might be nerve damage.  I have excruciating pain running from thigh to medial side and sometimes down lateral side.  When I walk, I am only able to walk stiff legged.  At this point, I am having trouble trusting anyone. Has anyone experienced anything like this?

"Long time ago I went to the family doctor about a knee pain, and he quickly diagnosed me with chondromalacia patella.
After that, over the years I got some flare ups when the pain was so bad I could hardly walk or stretch my leg.
I got one of those this past week, only this time I noticed that the pain went away completely overnight.
That night I took some pain PM pill to help me with the pain and to be able to sleep.
However I really doubt it was the pills that made the pain go away completely. Next morning I could walk just fine and I could stretch my leg straight100% without any problems. Like the flare up never happened.
So that got me curious if the pain is caused from some other reason like a dislocation of some sort. Any ideas?

"Hello All.    I would just like to hear of your experiences.   I am 8 months after my TKR  Op. and  at last am rejoicing in being able to walk confidently outside, without any aids. and feeling relatively pain free - bliss after months of agonising pain.  I am definitely coming out on the other side.   However, much as I am desperate to have a long soak in a bathtub, a thing of the past.  Try to get down on the floor wondering if I would ever be able to get up, and lastly run for a bus!!!   I have just lost my confidence and am cautious about doing any of them.   If I was stuck in the bath assuming my knee would not take the weight, there is no one at home to help me out.   How are you all fairing out there ?

"LTKR 12/2017.  Knee recovery is going well - my problem is my feet. Approximately eight weeks after LTKR I started feeling pins and needles in both of my feet.  It has progressed to pain on the bottom of my feet with some burning and some prickly feelings. The color on the bottom changes from light pink to red/blue/purple on the balls and toes when my feet are down and/or walking.  Sometimes they are very cold - the vascular doctor said it is neuropathy.  I will be seeing a neurologist and will be having more testing done.  (All testing done so far has come back normal).  Have you experienced anything like this or do you possibly have any thoughts on this?  Is there any hope that this will stop?

"Mid Feb. I dislocated my left patella on ice. I heard two pops which I thought was odd as I was falling . It was extremely painful, as it always is. I dislocate the right periodically. I relaxed and put it back . Usually I stretch it out and for me, this helps the recovery time. I couldn't stretch it out. I was still in extrem pain, which was confusing. I was with my husband so he carried me to the car and then into the house. The pain was crazy.
It took a good 6 weeks to be Blessed to walk mostly normal again. My doctor has sent out the paper work for an MRI. Still waiting for them to call me.
This week I finally can kneel down without loads of pain. Going up stairs still hurts. So does standing up from a chair.
Anyone have any ideas on what I did to my knee?
I just want to know what happened, but I have no idea when I will get the MRI.

"I’m a 54 yr old female. About a month ago out of the blue my knee/leg started hurting. Maybe slight swelling - if any. Pain is in the back of my knee down my calf and sometimes in the front chin area and sometimes knee cap area. Very painful when I first stand up and walking any distance is impossible without sitting at least once. Pain has woken me up at night several times.  I’ve torn the acl in my other leg but I knew it right away, with this one I have no clue how I hurt it, it just seemed to happen. 
Any ideas ? Really not wanting to go thru reconstruction surgery again so if it’s the acl what other options are there ?

"Hi all,  I posted the other day about my knee issues so I'll just refresh. I've had acl reconstruction in my left leg 2 years ago.  Out of the blue my right leg started getting stiff and hurting.... fast forward a month later it still hurts, BADLY. I went to the dr. He confirmed he thought it was a meniscus tear. I'm not convinced that it's not both my acl and meniscus. The pain is unreal, walking is very painful it wakes me up at night in pain.  My knee gives out and buckles, very scary. The pain is mostly in the back of my knee and one spot in my calf area feels like someone is stabbing a knife in that one spot. Last night my leg, chin area and foot were swollen - at this point I just need an answer. I go in a week for an MRI...if insurance approves it, which is doubtful. 
Any help or advise ?  Thanks

I cannot do my job as I could before and depression is setting in. I have tried a compression sock and that just makes my leg swell more than if I don’t use one. I find myself talking Motrin or Tylenol all the time because of swelling and pain. I’m feeling like I would have been better off just keeping my knee as it was before it hurt less then.

"My TKR left knee for osteo arthritis was over 5mths ago now but I am still finding I need two crutches to get some mobility in the mornings and after sitting for 15 mins. with what I think is nerve pain plus muscle stiffness. There seems little strength in my lower leg inspite of my walking dogs ( on two crutches ,) shopping, housework and excercising with difficulty.
I can walk unaided after some time but feel very insecure with a painful limp and hobble and wonder if it will ever improve. There is minimal joint swelling.
I had a hip replacement 8 yrs ago which was a dream compared to this.
 I am awaiting delayed hydrotherapy but meantime have started excercising/swimming in my local pool which I find really liberating but with extreme muscle stiffness next day. My flexion and extension is not very good although I keep trying to improve them.
 I was more able at two months post TKR than now but my consultant doesn't know why I am in so much pain on walking and recent Xrays shows satisfactory positioning of the implant. I refuse pain medication for obvious reasons and because I drive an automatic car and have no pain on sitting or sleeping.
I am 70 plus yrs.and overweight which I know is a hindrance but otherwise in good health being very active before this and am now very frustrated at not being able to see any ongoing   improvement.
Anyone else feel the same?

"Hello all, 
I am 23 years old with knee issues. I am 9 days out from my wedding and am really concerned. When I was in junior high I had an accident and had to have an MRI done on the right knee. The doctor said that my knee is honeycombed shaped and one day I would have to get it cleaned out. Well 7-8 years later my knee swelled up and became very painful all around. I went to my primary who decided 800 mg ibuprofen three times a day, ice and no weight baring. With no luck I went to the ortho who then said he thinks I have severe tendinitis, my next appointment is May 7th exactly five days from my wedding. The swelling hasn’t went down and the pain is now centerlized to the middle on the right side of the knee. It feels like someone is stabbing me. I’m anxious they might want surgery but we have plans to go out of state till May 22nd. Has anyone had these issues. I have not had an update MRI yet. Just an X-ray.

"I had surgery on Feb. 0,2018. The surgery went well and I was home the next day, and the following week I started in home physical therapy for the first two weeks. I just completed my 4th session of pt today in a very good facility. But since I've been going to therapy I've seen several people that had surgery within in the past three weeks and hey are doing a lot better than I am as for as being able to bend my knee, and this is really affecting me mentally,  
I'm doing doing the exercises and home, I'm not just sitting around, I moving around, doing little things around the house, driving short distances.  Because my knee is not bending its hard getting in and out of the car. and just trying to do as much as I can doing the day.  The pain is not that bad and I'm try not to take them so much being they are affecting my stomach.  
I have an appointment with the Doctor on the 26 of this month, but in the meaning time I am really becoming a bit concerned. 
I am a pr-k teacher and I was planning on going back to work after Spring break next month but right now I am not sure that I may be able to.  
I'm going to be 59 in May, I have always been active, I not overweight, I 5'8 and again very active.
My friends says that people heal different because of several reasons.  It is really frustrating because I feel like I working to get better and its not happening.  I still have swelling and some pain which sometimes is tolaraterable sometimes not.  
I just want to know has and or is anyone experiencing this amount of stiffness besides me.

"OK
The believed date I injured my knee was - 5 weeks ago, i was playing basketball with my little causin and i believed i landed wrong. My right knee did hurt but the pain started going away so I thought it was a bruise. Things seemed to start to normalize until i was active again about 1-2 weeks later, no it doesnt hurt to walk. When I was referee'ing a game i felt a bump behind my knee, i thought it was nothing but my knee started to swell more and my calves and thighs right above my knee started to feel sore. The next day i could barely starighten my knee it was swollen like a balloon. I finally asked a trainer who told me it was a cyst and i was out. I then saw an ortho and he told me I had a large popliteal cyst, he drained my knee ( not cyst) and tested it for lyme which it came out negative, no i dont have any bites or feel sick at all. The cyst started to decrease as there was less liquid in my knee, I could walk comfortably but then started to feel pain in my knee as my sweeling went down. The pain is usaually when I move, I usually feel it all around the knee cap, feels especially sore on the side of my knee and i did note it felt sharp where the x was a few times. I also feel pain above my cap if I fully flex my leg with strength. I also felt this wierd phenomena before that a string of pain (shaped like a vertical string) is sliding above my kneecap till it reaches the end the right. The doc performed all kinds of flexs and measurements that didnt hurt me. I feel no excruciating pain at all.

She rang my doctor who fitted me in immediately, started me on BP tablets & signed me off work. Six weeks of check ups & tablet increases brought my BP down. I had my op on April 3rd. My wound did not heal well & I was in hospital for 11days. I am now almost 4 weeks in, in alot of pain, not sleeping, feeling really down. Last week, my line manager paid me a welfare visit.

"So as many of you know, I had to take some time off work because my knees were too painful after I tried going to them gym (I’ve not had KR and I’m not sure if I suffer from patellofemoral pain syndrome or not, but probably an overuse injury as I’ve not had a sports injury or so. I’ve not had an MRI yet).
I went back to work on Monday after two weeks rest (no more pain at rest and very little after a long walk) and my knees started to hurt again (my job is very physical). I started using this gel I got online and after 2 days, there’s very little pain, I can’t even complain. My knees are not 100% okay but the pain is like a 2/10 at most at time and I have 0 pain sometimes. If I have the walk around really fast it goes up to a 4/10 and it used to be a 7-8/10 at all times at work. 
I feel really happy right now because I can continue to work but I’m not sure I’m doing the right thing. I’m not asking for medical advice, but I’m asking for opinions because many of you have more experience with pain. Could the gel just mask the pain and I could be doing more harm than good? It works even better than Naproxen. 
I’m going to see my doctor next week so will mention about it. I’m not sure I can tell the name of the gel here, if anyone interested to know, you can PM me.

"Hi, just wanted to post up something that I found helped me with the awful feeling around the scars on my knees, I found some real helpful things on this site during my many hours of unrest at night and early mornings, so hopefully this helps a few others. 
I seen a lot of posts for Bio-oil etc, but if like me you didn’t have any around you start to try other things.  I found aftersun cream really helped, rubbed in using small circles over the scars.  I’m 3 days from 6wk post op and at present the sensitivity around those scars is probably the most annoying thing remaining.  
Pain is well settled and no longer needing the ‘good stuff’ lol
I did 2 days in my office last week, and plan to return fully in a couple of days once I’m legally permitted to drive (6 weeks after any major surgery here in UK)
I appreciate everyone is different but it’s good to get both sides of recovery out there for people scarring (pun intended) the internet in the early hours for support / assurance. 
One other big thing I founds helped was the Reviver Pedal System, power assisted.   Really helped bring my bends up from the 67 degrees I left hospital with.  I’m now 85 on both with neg5 on one when straight and fully strait on other.   So easy to use, if bend is tight simply raise seated position to use initially. 
Main thing is PMA Positive Mental Attitude ohh and exercise exercise exercise lol.  
If you see yourself still using crutches in 3 mths you will be.  Push yourself, you know your own limits.  Get back to normality or as close to it as soon as possible.  It’s too easy to keep letting folks do everything for you. 
Stay positive and good luck ??????

"This is the biggest mistake I've made. Nothing but pain and not just minor. I am a very tough cookie and this is been the biggest depression I have ever faced. I am at 90 degree on my bend. The knee refuses to go further. My shin, feet and hip hurt just as bad. I can't sleep well and I eat and I feel like crap. I have to go back to work in 2 weeks. I can barley get through a day now.

"Hi 48, I'm 15 weeks post TKR, I had a manipulation 3 weeks ago, surgeon got the bend to 130, I've only managed between 75-90 at PT and I got 100 in hydrotherapy. I have a very stiff knee all the time. I'm seeing my consultant next Thursday and am worried about what he will say about my progress, he wasn't very Happy about the 1st manipulation as he said it was rare , had me apologising to him as I felt I had let him down. What is the most they expect from the bend? And will they do a 2nd manipulation. I'm dreading seeing him this journey has been awful, I'm exercising 3 x a day and going for walks but my knee is very stiff and always seems very swollen and purple in colour . Any advice appreciated x

"Never thought I would get this far down the line, after wanting to end it all within the first 4 weeks.Crying and feeling like I can’t do this anymore. Getting up in the morning and wanting bedtime to hurry up,pain off the scales, depression and not being able to move my knee.
Dreaded the thought of going to Physio and to be told I needed to get me knee back further, at 4 weeks could only move it 83 degrees.
Got so cheesed of by this that I wanted to burst into tears.
Next day I looked at my mini bike and thought this is it I’m getting on you, although it hurt a lot I kept up with it along with pushing on with the exercises. As well as walking my small dog.
Never worked so hard as I thought my knee was going to split open. Knee now at 110 degrees.
Now I get up every day and think another day of exercise, but do it then ice knee.
I am now going to swimming pool as well and hope that it will spring back into action very soon.
Doctors and physio’s say to get rid of walking stick, but this feels a little scary.
Anyway to all of you, it is really really hard and never thought I could get this far, but together we can do it.
But I won’t be getting the other knee done........
Keep going we will get there.

"I had TKR on 12/18/17. While very challenging at first, I recovered very well (so they tell me) and returned to work at 6 weeks out. I gradually stopped pain meds and only used Tylenol except for the occasional norco here and there. THEN...I had a conference that I attended last week. There was a lot of walking and a few flights of stairs here and there. I didn’t feel like it was terribly bad at the time, but by day 4 the pain increased quickly and with vengeance. I went to my Dr when I returned and he drained 60 cc of fluid and gave a shot of lidocaine. That helped that day but back bad as ever now. I’m a 58 year old female. Has anyone experienced a setback such as this?  I am in so much pain and now emotionally spent as well. I could just curl up and cry and would if it may help!  Any suggestions?  I continue with ice and rest but no luck.

I dislocated my knee at work Dec. 20th. 2017. Been off work since then. As it was a workers comp case it took me 3 months to get my surgery. Had an open knee realignment and I'm assuming it involved a lateral release. Well, my knee was immobilized straight for those 3 months prior to surgery. Had my surgery March 12th so I'm a month post op right now.
Knee bending is going very slow barely able to get 60 degree bend atm. Started pt this Wed, have me going 3 days a week for next 4 weeks.Was able to achieve full extension tonight, so happy about that but the bending is so frustrating right now.

"I had full bilateral knee replacements back in December of 2007. It went well. After about 3 home visits from the home nurse I was told I would be going in for more therapy. They would call me. No call for a week so I call them. They said they are not set up yet. I said.. time is wasting I need to keep this therapy going. The 4th time I called them asking for my appointments they said that I said to cancel them. WHAT?!  Needless to say, someone on their side messed up. I didn't get any of those therapy appointments. 2 full knee replacements on the same day and no therapy after the 1st 3. (the knee replacements were from a fall onto a cement slab onto both of my knees. 7 years later they are doing these replacements).
10 years later ~ Sept. 2016, I just had left thumb arthoplasty. My hand and forearm was in a soft cast. I'm out in the yard and I fall. Into the fall I'm thinking how I want to land. I don't want my arm to hit the ground and mess up the surgery. I don't want to fall on my knees. My left knee hit the ground first then my surgery arm hit. My left femur broke completely across the bone. Ambulance is called. I'm told after xrays that I cannot move the leg at all because it's like a shattered glass and if I move it the shattering will keep going up the leg. 
2 months after that femur surgery of which they inserted a rod into it. (I was able to walk on it the next day), I'm in therapy for my leg and again the pain in my knee on the inside of leg where the collateral ligament is had so much pain. After I had 5 doctors look at my leg (no one was able to see the problem because of all the metal in my legs), I'm left with the 5th doctor physically examining my knee and knocking it back and forth and said... ""your knee is lose"". The knee was already 10 years old so I'm saying replace it. I said I know the ligament is torn or not attached because my knee kept twisting i place for about 11 months during all of these frustrating appointments. It would twist and then lock up. The pain was unbelievable. Finally a very good sports doctor did my surgery. He said there was a lot of wear on the prosthetic of the two ends twisting in place. Also he said that the ligament was NOT doing me any good. So.... all this time and I finally find out that I was right and the doctors don't listen to us and made me go through a lot of suffering because they could not figure this out. 
The biggest issue I have about this is, in the first place, the surgeon at the beginning who put the rod in my femur, he knew I had a fake knee. He was the one that told me taking xrays or MRI's or ultrasounds aren't going to show a problem when there is already metal in the way. My comment is.... Ok, with that knowledge then when  you were putting the rod in my femur why didn't you take the extra time to inspect the surrounding area, since this was an accident injury, and MAKE SURE that I didn't injure the ligaments that hold it in place. I kept telling the emergency room doctors that my knee hit the ground first. So there was an impact spot close to the break. The break for my femur was only 2 inches above the knee. It's at the bottom of my femur, not the middle or not the top of the leg. 
In October 2017, I finally get a second full knee replacement. This one is a ""CONFINED KNEE REPLACEMENT"" meaning the shanks are longer and the knee has a tendon/ligament like connector that runs up the center holding the knee in place better. All is well and I was in therapy for 2 months then my insurance changed. I had to cancel all future appointments because now I'm paying more then I can for my coverage and the coverage does not like physical therapy. Since then I have fallen a few more times. The last time was pretty hard and I KNOW I have now loosened the right knee because it's tried to twist on me while walking.
I'm afraid to move these days. I'm almost 63 years old. I am retired because of all these physical issues. I am walking worse then my father and he's almost 93! I am not using a walker but I'm close to it. I am a serious vegetable garden grower. I'm trying to get back into it for this season but I can hardly walk. I have had 17 hand surgeries (both hands totaled up) and have wrist issues too. So using my hands and wrists are very difficult but of course I'm having to use them. So getting on the floor is very very difficult and getting up almost impossible. I've had feet issues and nerve pain. Including issues with A-Fib and Fibermyalgia. The nerve pain throughout is challenging also. I also have osteopenia. So when does the osteoperosis kick in? 
My question is how many knee replacements can a person have? I tend to fall alot from being unbalanced in my walking. I have not had my knee looked at to see if it now needs to be replaced. My insurance changes to Medicare on June 1st because of my disability benefit that allows me to go on it before I'm 65. That's when I can get to a doctor. If I need that knee replacement and then I fall again... what's next? I don't think they can give me a larger knee. 
Whew! That was a lot of typing.

"Hi,
During my late teens through to my early thirties my left knee would lock. This was always when moving my leg from left to right when the leg was bent. The pain was excrutiating - if I were to describe it it felt like bone against bone if I tried to extend the leg (I know it's not possible but that's how it felt). The pain would be at the outer edge of the knee. A lot of hot towels and courage was required to keep moving my leg millimetres at a time until eventually I would feel something at the back of my knee 'come apart', then it was immediate relief. Apart from feeling a little stiff, I experienced no swelling or bruising afterwards. I never went down to the doctors as I thought it was part and parcel of a problem that I had had with my knee since my teens (Chrondomylacia Patella).
I am now in my early forties and my knee hasn't locked for approximately 8 years until several weeks ago when it happenend in the early hours of the morning when I turned over in bed. Unfortunately I had to call the Paramedics and after plenty of Gas & Air and 3 hours later it unlocked but this time the back of my knee was about 6 inches off the bed before it popped - normally it unlocks whilst still relatively bent. The thought of going through that again terrified me so I went to the Doctors.
I have had an MRI scan and was advised that the scan hadn't shown anything. I have to admit to feeling upset that nothing has shown that can be rectified to stop it happening again. I've now been 'dimissed' by the Doctor with no advice other than if it happens again they'll refer me and a full stop.
Has anyone else had/got a similar problem?
Any help/suggestions would be really appreciated.
Many thanks.

"Hello, My pain management doctor has suggested that a spinal cord stimulator may be a good option to try and reduce my knee pain. I'm curious to see what others may have experienced with this.
I'm a 44 yo man that was healthy until my knee began hurting about 9 years ago with no injury. I've since had 6 arthroscopic surgeries. I've had 3 surgeries where they opened me up including an ACI, (carticel) bi-compartmental replacement and a total knee replacement in July of 2016. Following the tkr I had very limited range of motion. I developed arthrofibrosis where the scar tissue grew too rapidly to be corrected with therapy. I was unable to straighten my leg. I could only get it to about 20%. I had a scope to clear it out, and an impatient manipulation under therapy that still did not allow me to straighten it and continued to have a good deal of pain. I had a second manipulation around 8 months after the tkr that finally restored the ability to straighten my leg. I can only bend it to around 85% and still have constant pain. Last month I had a radio frequency ablation to burn the nerves. While the tests provided good pain relief, I'm about 6 weeks out and the pain is back to pretty much where it was prior. At my follow up last week he gave me the option of trying the spinal stimulator.
I've seen three specialists who have all said that there are no more surgical options. Due to the amount of surgeries I've had they say the risk is too great and that amputation could be a real possibility if they were to operate again.
My wife actually has a trial spinal stimulator put in last week due to multiple make surgeries. Afterwards I asked the doctor about the effectiveness they have for knee pain. Her doctor didn't feel that they were a very viable option for knee pain. My doctor who works at the same clinic suggested it as a viable option hours later.
Has anyone here had a spinal stimulator for knee pain, and what are your thoughts?
Thanks

The doctor kept blaming everything but him or the knee. It has been a grueling time for me and my family. all i wanted to do is better myself for my daughter and ride bikes with her.  Now I have contacted a highly recommended doctor for reconstruction but was turned down with no explanation. they can not find anything wrong but the films MRIs CT scans say not clear but mostly no loosening. I have complained from the beginning  something was wrong. I ended up being in the hospital for 8 days and begged to go home i couldn't even get up one stair. pain is unbearable  especially if i stumble and it get caught the pain is horrible. There is much more to the story with this doctor i can write a book but bottom line is i am trying to find a reconstruction Dr. But no hope so far recommendations gladly accepted and maybe if someone was in the same condition as i am.

"Hello,
?I've posted a few times about the ongoing problems with my left knee. I now feel more confused than ever after yesterday's consultation. This a brief chronology:
2012                         Went to GP re. knee pain – referred to musculo-skeletal clinic.
2012 – 2013            Steroid injections (no difference) + physio
November 2013       Arthroscopy & microfracture of left knee (4months off work, pain, unable to bend or kneel or drive) Physio felt kneecap out of alignment – not discussed with consultant
2014                        Arthroscopy & microfracture of right knee – success – no problem since
2014-2015               Ongoing appointments & steroid injections left knee, hyaluronic acid injection
2015                        Arthroscopy & microfracture of left knee – some improvement
2016                        deterioration of left knee again – back to pain levels of 2013. Gradual deterioration ongoing
2016                        To musculoskeletal clinic. To physiotherapy.
2017                        MRI, stated pes anserinus inflammation, not arthritis, steroid injection given (no difference made)
2017                        Physiotherapy, ultrasound given and strapping – no difference.
2018                        Saw consultant, Mr R, stated leg/knee out of alignment, talked about osteotomy. MRI + x rays
2018                        Telephone consultation with Mr R, no mention of alignment. Stated arthritis and recommend talk to Mr C re. pros and cons of knee cap replacement
2018   Mr C stated knee not showing excessive wear, not suitable for replacement. Said would do arthroscopy to see problem.
?I fell I have two types of pain - one the bone grinding ache that is constantly there. Then also  a ""hot"" pain - like my knee is on fire - this is more on the inside of the knee. I cannot bear for it to be touched. At times when I use pain relief gel to try to get some relief then I have to brace myself to put it on. Consultant felt this was strange as the pain I feel should be inside the knee.
?Now I just don't know. I've agreed to the arthroscopy as can't see there is another option. I felt it was offered as a sop to me. Consultant felt there was not really enough wear and tear to offer a knee cap replacement but this is at odds with the pain I gt on sitting with my knee at right angles. Problems as follows:
Cannot drive more than 30 miles
Driving is an issue – depressing clutch
Struggle when getting up off floor (not elegant!)
Constant aching pain
“Hot” pain at times
Pain impacting on daily life.
Pain killers not have much effect – but try not to take them
Sometimes will take cocodamol, ibuprofen and voltarol gel in order to sleep
Pain will wake at night
Find it difficult to sit with leg at right angles
Will always sit with feet up at home
Impact on working life – do not take time of sick as have decent work ethic – but in constant pain
Cannot bear touch on knee – seems ultra-sensitive
Will stiffen up when sat – find it difficult to get out of chair or car. Will swivel round in car to put both feet down to get out.
?The last two days have been bad. I could cry with the pain and there seems to be no relief and no way out. 
?I don't understand how I can have so many differing opinions and no clear answers. I'm not hopeful of this arthroscopy doing anything. How many can you have? If he chops more bits away, surely in the end there'll be nothing left. He did point out the 'fat pad' (?) and said that looked good. Well I do know that bits of that was chopped off in the second procedure so don't understand how it can look good. 
?I have booked an appointment with the GP. I am wondering whether to try to talk to the consultant again and go through this chronology. I just don't know. Sat here in pain with no answers. 
Does anybody have any advice?
?My mobility is good. I have no back or hip problems. I have no swelling.
?I'm not sure I should be here or in the arthroscopy page - it's more a problem than just arthroscopy I think!

"Question for the group. So about 18 months ago I had back surgery which laid up my exercise and mobility.  I noticed “tightness “ in both knees and some minor difficulties bending. 
Then about 12 months ago I was walking and boom super sharp burning pain. Wow, lasted 3 weeks. Laying in bed was horrible. Move a bit and shooting pain. Was actually able to get into specialist and he did a quick ultrasound and said he thinks torn miniscus and said they don’t operate on it anymore and especially if I have arthritis. He sent me to get X-ray, which confirmed arthritis.
 Now the last year I have that miniscus feeling in both knees on and off. And the tightness is getting much worse. I cannot even bend down and go on knees. I am walking like I am 90.
 Yesterday I actually took a 85 year old to a sports game and he walks better. My knees are both swollen and left is burning and sharp pain and sore from 4 inches below knee and up 8 inches.
 What do u all think it is, arthritis or miniscus, or something else. What should I do. What helped u guys.
 I been taking aleeve and ice but nothing touching it!!

"Hi everyone. I am almost 8 months TKR post op and not recovering well. A lot of pain and swelling. My concern right now is that the past two days I've had extreme pain on the inner side of my operated knee. This pain is new and came on suddenly and getting worst. Now it's not just painful on the inside but it's also very very tender to the touch. I wanted to know if anyone had experienced this before I go running back to my doctor.

"[kim20134]  kim20134 I saw the Consultant yesterday and I was 7 weeks post op. I have great bend and full extension. I told him that I had had an infection that had not been detected until week 4. He queried the GPs diagnosis (they don’t want any responsibility for infection). He stated that I should not be feeling fatigued, much pain and experiencing sleepless nights. And I should be much further down the line recovery wise. He said patients are ‘skipping’ into his room and wowing the op. I go out for a few hours at a time then become tired. The pain keeps me awake at night. I do chores and cook but tire easily. My husband and I thought I’d been doing well, walking without support and driving. Considering the infection had set me back a few weeks I thought his remarks were a bit harsh. 
He asked for more bloods and X-rays and wants me to return in 6 weeks.

"Hi everyone!!  You all helped me out so much when I had my TRKR last June, you helped me get through a very tough time and I thank you again for it.  Well, I'm back after having my left knee done hoping you all are wel!
After having this knee done I realize that last year was a walk in the park compared to what I am going through now.  Ever since I woke up in recovery I have had severe calf pain from my knee down.  So severe the first few days I couldn't bump it against anything nor could I put any weight on it, the pain was so bad it actually put me in a full blown panic attack twice in the hospital.  They sent me for an ultra sound to make sure there was not a blood clot. The best way to describe this pain is like when you have a Charlie horse and the cramps that you are left with afterwards only permanently .   My boyfriend has gently massaged out the calf so it wasn't so tight anymore and we will heat it and ice it but that gentle massaging actually left me with a big bruise. I will wake up in the middle of the night to out of the blue during the day in tears for hours because of this pain.  Please please tell me this is normal and somebody out there has had the same sort of problem.  Thank you so much.

"For those that have had multiple knee surgeries your opinion please. I have had too many problems with my bionic knee ( putting it bluntly it sucks!! )Now I am in a psottion which really stinks. The Specialist that I being referred to I will not be able to see till the 15th one reason had to switch insurance and does not go into effect till May 1st and the Dr. that referred me say I should talk to the new Dr. concerning my issues. ( I think that was more from his nurse not the Dr. himself. I am going to see my pain Dr. next week but now what should I do? I am worried if I get some stronger medication it might effect how my body reacts to the meds I will get at the hospital. If you take pain meds for a period of time the body builds up a tolerance so that is why I am hesitant. I have been told this surgery that I need is going to hurt even more so then a typical TKR due to they have to do something to the tibia since there is going to a significant amount of bone loss due to all the TKRs I have had and there is nothing left to place the implant on. So there is my concern why am I asking because it hurts and it hurts a lot I woke up this morning my knee is more swollen then normal just puttering around in the yard flat out hurts so am I being too paranoid about asking for stronger meds or should I just tough it out? Really hate being miserable.

"This may seem odd coming from me I have been thru a lot of  what most of your are experiencing with a TKR. I can suggest many different things from what to expect after the OR till you leave the hospital, what to expect from when you get home I know you will have at home care to monitor blood and at home PT. I understand how after 2 months you get so frustrated it drives you nuts and even after 6months and further down the road I get it. I have been thru it I know first hand it really sucks. I try and offer help since I have been thru this too many times but I am not perfect. Some of you get depressed after less then a year or maybe farther down the road Well here I am I think it flat out sucks that I have had all these knee surgeries I hate it when my knee hurts its one thing if you have never been thru this  but how do I ask for help when I am flat out miserable. I have had a bad weekend today my pain is pushing the 7 mark on the 1 to 10 scale for pain. Who is going to say something that I have not tried . If I thought goiung to the ER would help I would be on my way but  having done that in the past its pointless having a knee problem is not rated very high as far as priorities go. I hope no one has to go thru what I am dealing with I really hate it.

"Hi all, 
I have just found this site and have read many of the great contributions from its members and am really grateful as I am about to have TKR on my left knee in the next week or so, I've just been to hospital and had all the pre op stuff so just waiting for a phone call to tell me when to go in. I will then be having TKR done on my right knee later ( the surgeon seems to think 3-4 months after first one).
Its been a long journey to get this far with many years of pain and reducing amounts of mobility. I had to stop working and go on ""sick"" approx nine months ago and it has taken this long to finally get the surgeon to do the operation. I've had numerous X-rays, MRI's etc which initially led to me having keyhole surgery (Arthoscopy) on my left knee in January. I had a spinal anastetic so was awake for that and as soon as the surgeon could see inside the knee he said that because of the amount of damage there was little that he could do at the time and it was obvious that a TKR was required. 
So that's where I'm at, anxious about the surgery but desperate to get it done and try and get back to work/ doing normal things again etc.
Thanks again for all the advice and posts and I will try and post more details as things happen as I think that this will help motivate me, and maybe others.
Cheers

"Good day,
l was recently diagnosed with R knee PVNS - Diffuse type.
Click here to view image
The treatment ONLY option l was given was an open surgery which l read on and found not to a guaranteed solution. 50% of the tumor growing again is a nightmare.
l hereby come to you trying to relate and understand how you are managing pre and post op. As in the subject, my condition is diffuse type - the monster of them all.
A brief story of mine goes: my R knee has been swollen since when l was 9. l was restricted from taking part in sports, doing straneous activities. Basically l could not play outside or at school like any other ""black african kid"". Growing up; l devised a way to walk to keep people away from asking why l was limping, l stopped n do not wear shorts and skinny pants - my tumor just loves to show off itself so l hide it the best way l can. l will rather be late than run to make it on time because in many cases back @ school l'd run, my knee would give in, l'd fall and find myself in pain an adolescent and teenager doesn't deserve. Right now, l just tolerate the pain, l do not take regular or daily treatment for this. If the pain gets worse like today, which usually happens when it gets cold or after rains, l get msyelf a cortisone shot, within an hr or so, l will be back to the pain l know and tolerate. 
FYI - l am a black male. Living with this condition is very tough in this part of the world because people in my community do no understand such things like this ""rare diseases"".And as much as they do not know, no one wants to learn about them ... even doctors!!! l am based in South Africa/Pretoria, our medical care is beyond poor am sure if you follow health stastics - stupid treatable disease are lethal/fatal on this part of the planet. With that said, imagine bringing PVNS to a surgeons consulting room ... l don't even want to imagine his/her reaction to it.
Back to PVNS - lol, my fingers are literally trembling as l type along. 
- l bet most of you are in the 1st worlds. What were the treatment options you were given upon making the diagnosis? And what were your choices?
- With a number of PVNS/TGCT Clinical trials being conducted in the 1st worlds, did y'all consider taking part, if yes what was the outcome, if no which Rx method did you declare to be better and why?
- For those who chose to go for surgery, how are you doing 2 weeks, a month, 3 months, 6 months, a year and 2 years post op? Any reoccurances yet, if yeah, whats the way forward?
- For those who are recovering, what has your journey been like from day 1 post op? am talking pain, immobility, exercise, swelling, surgery complications etc? Shout out to @Paul, @O'conor and @Oldfatguy (l am sorry to use the nickname - l couldnt find his name on any of the posts l went through) for sharing your stories, they touched me so deeply.
- To the diffuse PVNS sufferers particularly, they are those like @Tinisha if l am not mistkaken, whose tumor is close to the nerves, what have you decided to do as a way forward. l wasnt told of the level of damage of my knee but its approx 2-3 times the size of my left knee. If l am standing straight up looking from quads, all the way down to my knee all looks even jus like one long block of meat. The lower part of the limb from the apex of the tibia down looks very normal but funny at the same time because my entired R leg looks the ""Finger of God"" (https://www.gondwana-collection.com/blog/finger-of-god/). l do not know if my bones are damges, l don't know if the nervous system is damaged too. l sometimes experience pins and needles under my right foot (rare ocassions), sometimes the knee itself gets so itchy and hot. Lord... l do not know why l had to have this.
Click here to view image
- As rare as PVNS is, l was hoping that pharmaceutical and sponsor companies would go all out to harness people like us (well l mean the willing type like me), study this condition, spend/invest and reach ground-breaking heights before it booms and becomes common like Arthiritis. l am more than willing to participate in any phase from I to IV of a clinical trial but my problem is the geographic location l am in. l hope a someone reads this and have a sponsor/pharmaceutical company reach out to me.
l have said a lot, didn't l? l believe we will conquer this, if not - this portal should serve generations to come to help understand PVNS/TGCT better. And thanks to the people who keep this portal alive and going!!!
Your replies are much appreciated, will stay and hold onto this portal for dear-life.

"After 10.5 months since my TKR, 2 MUA's and a final ROM of -10 and +90, I can hardly describe my TKR journey as a success... After being told by my surgeon and 2 of the 4 physios I have seen, that 'if I couldnt get my leg straight in 4 - 6 weeks post-op and then post-MUA, I would always have a limp', didnt help with my state of mind...
However, until a couple of weeks ago, I did indeed have 'the limp', but took the two following courses of action last month and now I dont. Start to finish 4 - 6 weeks.... Best thing thats happened to me since June 2017..... Give it a go....
1 - Lengthen your step/stride. i.e Dont take your TKR leg off the floor at the back of the step so soon. It will feel a little strange, but stick with it... I had access to a treadmill. I would set the machine at a slow pace (do hang on to something) and gradually increase this, but NOT the speed of my step. You take up the greater distance traveled with a longer stride. Try and take your mind off your knee and focus on simply walking... Its what you used to do before all this TKR stuff !
2 - Work on stretching your TKR leg, calf muscles. Tight calves will make step 1 above harder, so get stretching. 
Easy to determine if calves are tight. Sit on a bed/floor/flat surface and ask someone to bend your toes towards you. My TKR foot wouldnt bend anything like my other, indicating tight calves.
Dont think I need a walking stick any more, but have a lightweight walking pole for 'security', as walking 'properly' is still a little strange. A month ago I was able to shuffle round with the dog for 40 mins. Today I was out in the woods for 80 minutes and didnt stop once. Im now typing this with some ibuprofen on board and an ice-pack on my knee, but I cant stress how much Ive improved in 5 weeks....... 
Would love to know if this works for anyone else.....

"I have been at -5/100 ROM since the 2nd week of my TKR surgery and the numbers didn't move even with me working on the ROM exercises everyday with and without my PT folks.    
So at my 12 week post op meeting with the surgeon he said he wanted to do a MUA.    After the MUA,  Dr. Burton said I had a lot of scar tissue.  He said there was a lot of popping come from the knee as he moved it around. In the end he said he got the knee to go to 0/125. He was happy with but I am not...my other knee is 0/135 which is basically a normal knee so I am hoping with time I can get to at least 0/130. He told me in no uncertain terms, this next two weeks (I see him again on the 3rd of May) my job is do the ROM exercises every hour possible and other than that stay off my legs as much as possible to help get the swelling down. He said that swelling is the enemy to ROM recovery. 
Several hours after the MUA I met with his PT folks.  When they measured my ROM it was 0/120...so I already lost 5 degrees of bend.  Again, I was not happy but they said that is normal that you don't get the bend that the surgeon will get.  They also stressed that I need to do the ROM exercises as often during the day as I can...they said at least every hour.  
I am back home and the drugs that he injected in my knee during the MUA are wearing off so I am in PAIN.   The pain for me is much more than what I experienced after the TKR.  Which is very surprising to me.  I am also experiencing pain from my foot to my hip.  The surgeon said that is because of how he had to move my body to get the knee to move.  I do have black and blue marks coming up.  
But I am doing the ROM exercises as much as I can.  
For all of those are facing a possible MUA I will  keep you posting  on this site what is happening to me.  As we all know everyone has there own recovery schedule but I hope I might be able to give folks some insight into at least one MUA after a TKR.

"BACK STORY: Surgery 4 month ago.Very bad tear.Enlarged lateral meniscus.Doc used blood clot and sutures to repair.Healed well because Im young (19).Cyst and was lateral and slightly anterior towards patella.3 scars-2 on the sides of patella, 1 large scar half inch laterally from where the cyst was. 
PROBLEM: Since 2 months post surgery I noticed pain/inflammation in area just under large scar.Location is inch above fibular head and maybe half inch anterior.Basically its a bump as noticeable as my fibular head and painful when pressed/massaged.1 month ago I got an MRI and doc said meniscus was fine and the area of pain just looks like scar tissue and related complications but still not sure.After many weeks the pain and related inflammation hasnt changed and I have tried everything from weight lifting for hip and thigh muscles to stretches/massaging/icing the area and surrounding tendons/tissues but no noticeable change.Dont think its IT band syndrome cause the bump is just under the lateral epicondyle.The bump is near many tendons and ligaments and stuff but doesnt directly intersect any of them.The pain comes after leaving leg bent for too long or doing weight lifting.I played some basketball and the impact caused no immediate pain but the day after the bump was very sore.Also I can temporarily massage the bump down to semi flat but there is always a very hard structure(scar tissue or maybe bone?) still in the way which concerns me for slight tibial torsion.

"My wife is experiencing debilitating back and hip problems since a TKR in 2003.  Had right knee replacement and her knee flings out to the right when she walks,  This causes her to dip to the right putting excessive pressure one the right hip and her lower right back. She is miserable. We consulted with a pain specialist in our area who noticed her wobbly walk. Their conclusion for her chronic pain on that side is the KNEE REPLACEMENT. Never had any hip or lower back pain prior to the replacement. I'm in agreement with Allison...it's a lousy Total Knee Replacement. We're trying to find a way to have the surgery redone by a competent specialist in our area. We met a recent recipient of a TKR at our gym. I asked if he had any physical issues at all after I observed him doing a rigorous workout. His reply was...""none at all"". He said his knees work better now than they ever did. His walk is perfectly straight, no out of place bending or wobble! He observed my wife's walk and immediately referred us to his orthopedic surgeon at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore, MD. We are following up on his suggestion.  This may not go well financially, as we have to prove that the TKR caused the other debilitating issues if we expect our insurance to pay for the redo.. However, I will not give up until she's walking straight and pain free again. People, please do not accept mediocre medical care. Do your research until u get sound answers!

"It's been 9wks since my surgery. I have been able to walk without help since day 3. I'm still having allot of pain and swelling is really bad. I have been having PT but I still can't bend my knee but 88°. My PT councillor does the same exercises 3 times a wk. I have missed the last 2 sessions because of this. I don't seem to be having any trouble doing much of anything I want except for bending my knee. I'm anxious to get back to work but doubt I will be able to because of the swelling and bending. My job demands me walking and standing all day. Walking anywhere from 7 to 13 miles. I'm scared I won't be able to go back to work. Is anyone else having trouble with swelling and bending after 9weeks after surgery.

"7 weeks ago I injured my knee whilst at a theme park on an inflatable game having to jump over the moving pole going round (I’m a big kid!) as I jumped over my leg didn’t and I went one way whilst my leg went another. I felt a pop in my knee and immediate pain as I fell. Since i haven’t been able to straighten my knee! I have had X-rays and MRI which shows a grade 2 MCL Spain, waiting physiotherapy. I have also been diagnosed with a DVT likely as a result of the injury and the clot runs up behind my knee into my thigh. The symptoms of the dvt are under control but I still can’t get back to normal as I can’t straighten my knee or bend it past 90degrees. I am young and normally active and I’m just wondering if anybody has any clues as to what I’ve actually done as I’m sure a sprain would not still cause me this much bother surely?! I’ve tried straighten my leg in the bath, in bed, laying down standing up and it just won’t budge (always been able to limp about with it all). It feels like something is stopping it, not massives of pain but some pain within the knee when trying. Has anybody had anything similar or could shed any light in this I’d appreciate it

"Hope no one here is in my shoes it stinks. To date I have had 17 surgeries on my L knee and another on the way. Since my last TKR ( May 9th 2016 ) I have had increased pain in left knee. The surgeon that did several of my knee surgeries retired and he referred me to another surgeon. No matter how many times I sent a message about how my knee felt nothing. Finally I got tired and found another surgeon. Had lab work and Bone scan done. The lab work shows no infection the bone scan was glowing!! To confirm whether it was infection or loosening more lab still no signs of infection. That is great had an infection before no fun. Now I find out the implant was put in wrong not aligned properly. I was told there is supposed to be 2mm of spacing and on my left its almost 40mm. Another issue I have had 5 TKR and there is going to be significant bone loss when they take this implant out. Now I am waiting to see a specialist who treat cancer and bone tumor patients since from what I have been told this will be a very complicated surgery . Has anyone gone thru anything like this?? I have had 17 surgeries so far on my L knee now I am in constant pain. Even with jeans on the average person can tell I have lots of swelling this really stinks.

I was told to sit in chair, and stretch leg out so heel is on another chair.  Then put a weight on my knee.  this hurts.  But all these exercises hurt.  
Just so you know.  at 6 weeks I was only at 105 and was considering manipulation under anesthesia.  So glad I didn't do that.  Just keep working on it!!!

"Hi. I had tkr on both my knees   My right knee which was in awful is doing well, whereas my left knee is lagging behind.  My PTs and my doctor say that it is normal. I don’t compare myself to others recuperating but it is frustrating when I can’t sleep in my bed (need to sleep in a recliner), my gait  is off, and I walk very slowly.  I’m lucky because I have no real pain, just a burning sensation, but still it can get me down.  NO ONE told me it would be 6 months until I was somewhat better and a year until I would be me again. It’s been almost 3 months and I’m hoping that by the summer I’ll be able to get to the beach and enjoy my granddaughter.  I am glad I did both at one time - not sure I’d  want to go go through it a second time.  Thanks everyone for sharing!  Do your exercises!

"Last TKR was May 9th 2 years ago. I was told after the one year mark will determine how it will feel from that point on. However that is not the case mine has gotten worse. Last Dr. did nothing he was referred by another Dr. who I really liked but retired. Finally got sick of asking for help and getting no where found a different Dr. Had lab and Bone scan done Labs were fine Bone scan bad. Had more labs done to completely rule out infection now it seems the components are loosening and the pain is getting lousy. The Dr. that suggested these tests after looking at the result is referring me to a Specialist. First appt is May 15th. If it did not hurt so much I would not bother to ask but this stinks. I have been thru numerous surgeries and was wondering what you all do or take for pain I am hoping there might be other choices besides pain meds which still might be the best choice. Currently I take Hydrocodone 10 / act 325 4-5 a day I also have a pain patch 15mg of Buprenorphine every week. When in pain I elevate and wrap it in ice for approx. 30-40 minutes. Depending on the level of pain at night I sometimes use a pillow which helps.I could do absolutely nothing but that would make things worse PT and the Dr.s want you to stay active. Not expecting any miracles for my pain relief more or less wondering if you do something different that helps.

"hi everyone, just a word of caution for you all if you have been given the option to have your knee bursa removed. if I could turn back time I would rather of changed my job so I didn't have to kneel on my leg.
I am a 47 year old marine engineer physically fit but not super fit.
within the last 12 months I was getting swelling in my right knee more and more, caused by frequent kneeing, if the type of work changed I got no swelling at all, but work demanded I use my knees a lot, I went to several different private doctors who prescribed injection, anti inflammatory drugs leading up to an appointment with a traumatologist,I explained the past eight months had been difficult to work so he recommended minor surgery to remove the bursa sack and stated I should be back to normal in 4 to 6 weeks,I of course did as you are doing now reading up on the net first.
so on the 16th Dec 2009 I had my surgery, the small surgery gave me a 1 night in hospital, 10 cm scare on my knee, a little swollen which I thought was obvious and very little discomfort from the healing process all seemed well.
unfortunately my knee filled up with fluid again restricting my job, I returned to see the traumatologist who seemed un-surprised at first and drained about 50ml of pale red fluid from my knee this problem persisted for 1 month more the last time I visited him he made a small cut with a scalpel to help remove more fluid and small blood clots.
but it still filled with fluid, so he suggested a second op to do negative drainage? not sure what he meant but I was desperate to get back to normal.
the surgery took place on the 8th Jan 2010 this was a total failure ime sorry to say my leg swelled up like a football, the pain was terrible but I was discharged the next day to rest, I had only been home 3 hours with my leg raised up when I became tired and confused, luckily my wife was with me and noticed I was bleeding heavily through the thick bandages onto her new cushions, she got me an ambulance to the emergency depot, where they did very little except bind it up too tight and kept me in hospital again so my surgeon could see me the following day.
I cant express in words the severity of pain I went through that afternoon when the doctor performed drainage of my knee in my hospital bed, along with 2 bags of blood transfusions, I honestly cant believe how strong my heart is, it did me proud.
the next day the 9th Jan 2010 my surgeon called to see me and suggested emergency surgery, within 1 hour I was being operated on under gen anaesthetic.
today is Sunday 14th Jan 2010 I should be out with my lovely wife celebrating St valentines day but I am still in hospital, with a drain tube in my leg.
I look awful, I am so pale I feel totally deflated, I cant wait to get better, and get out of here.
please reconsider the full necessity why you need your op, think about your options, there probably has been hundreds of successful bursa operations but I have been so unlucky.
family and friends have already indicated I should take the private hospital to court, but I would not know where to start I just want my life back soon and I pray he has not taken away anything inside my knee that will stop me doing a job I love.
if anyone's interested I will update my experience next month.
on a lighter note the blood stain washed out of the cushion.
take care of yourselves
Tony

"Hi! In March of 2017 I had a TKR on rt knee. Due to excessive pain and swelling I then had arthroscopy in November to remove scar tissue but found little relief. Finally in February My leg was opened all the way up again, all plastic was removed so Doc could get all the way into back of knee to remove massive build-up of scar tissue he couldn't reach or see with arthroscopy and he did a poly exchange, tendon release during that last surgery too.
I am now 8 weeks out from last surgery, and while better than It has been in last year, I am still having heat, swelling, weakness/discomfort on stairs, stiffness after any rest period. Still icing snd elevating every day as ordered! My bakers cyst at back of knee (started about 2 wks after first surgery) us still there as well.
I guess my question is how long should I expect this last recovery period to last before I reach some level of permanent leveling off of heat, swelling, pain on activity.

"65 y.o. male. I had a TKR on my right knee Nov 2016. From the beginning I have had loud cracking, clicking, popping noises in my knee as well as prolonged swelling. Like everyone else, I was told ""that's normal, it will go away after a few months"". So, a year and a half later I can shake my knee left and right with loud noises, same with up and down. Each Dr I have spoken to, 4 so far including the surgeon, are shocked at the sound and have no explanation. The surgeon thinks it might be too thin a spacer between the two metal pieces, but he isn't sure. In addition he has drained 40 to 50 cc of fluid (pinkish red) from my knee on back to back weeks and decided there was no need to continue draining since it seems to fill up as fast as it comes out. No infection when tested. I did all the exercises, passed all the goals by week 7, did 2 weeks in house rehab (wasn't very happy with that) due to having a multi level home and wanting to reduce my fall risk. Fairly active, hunting, hiking, working, but have constant pain, don't fully trust the new joint, and the noise is driving everyone crazy. Dr wants to go back in to see what the problem is. Each Dr has said they've not encountered the symptoms I exhibit all at the same time. Anyone else have this? Oh, I also have 2 to 4 OTC heel inserts in my L shoe to make my legs the same length and reduce severe back pain.

"I know my case might not be as severe as some of yours out there, but I’m worried and anxious and sad right now so I’m gonna tell my story.
I’m a 22-year-old female living in the UK. My knee pain (both my knees) started in 2013. I had been doing intense cardio exercises for 4 months or before, all of a sudden, my pain started during my cardio session. The pain was so bad I had to stop. I remember the next day I walked to school and the pain was so bad I could barely walk and I was in tears. I went to my doctor and he said I “stretched “ my MCLs and recommended rest and a gel that was supposed to help with the pain and reduce inflammation. My knees weren’t swollen or anything and I could bend them normally, just that they were very sore. The pain went away in 2-3 weeks.
In 2014 I started working out again (squats and lunges with no weights this time), but after the second session  the pain started again. Went to see an orthopaedist, he took an X-ray , everything was normal and he said I was suffering from Osgood-Schlatter Disease. The pain went away in 2 or 3 weeks again with rest.
Less than a month ago I was really determined to start working out again so I tried to do a few simple leg exercises and I noticed my knees were a tiny bit sore. I decided to see a physio and after a long conversation she said I have Patellofemoral pain syndrome. We did a few shoulder bridges and stuff like that to see what hurts and what doesn’t and the session left me in pain, but only like 3/10 pain. 
When I got home I did a few leg extensions and my knees started hurting even more. The next day I had to go to work (my job is really physical, I work at McDonald’s) and by the end of my shift I was in agony. I had worked here for more than a year and never had knee pain before doing those exercises. 
I had to take time off from work, but I went back after 5 days like an idiot. I don’t know if I made it worse or not, the pain is always there even when I rest,
 Naproxen does help a, but it doesn’t remove the pain completely. I had to stop taking it because it gave me acid reflux. Tomorrow is my last day of work and after that I’m gonna be off for at least 2 weeks. I also have another appointment with my doctor tomorrow. He hasn’t been of much help tbh, he told me not to go to work if I felt like it was too much. Ordered another X-ray which was fine, I want to ask him  tomorrow’ to refer me to an MRI. He also recommended me to get a blood test which I haven’t yet because I have the worst blood phobia ever.
now I’m scared that my pain won’t go away like it used to do in the past because I went back to work while I was still in pain.
i get pain on the right and left side of patella, under it especially when walking and sometimes behind the knee cap.
My left knee also feels very tight or something like that, it’s hard to explain, when I’m in bed, resting. It’s a weird sensation. I sometimes get pain in my quads and down to my feet as well which I don’t know if I used to in the past as it was a few years ago and I don’t really remember.
i know I might sound dramatic but I’m really scared I won’t be able to enjoy the rest of my life cause of this knee problem. There’s a concert on the 13th to which my friends are going but I don’t know if I should go I’m so scared that every move is gonna make it worse, I’m not even sure if I’m supposed to be in bed all day or not. I can’t afford to go back to physio either.
Just looking for support and people with similar experiences. Sorry if this was hard to read. English is not my first language and grammar is not really my thing either.

"I have suffered for at least 15 years with both knee problems and arthritis in knees and ankles. 10 years ago I had my right ankle fused.
6 months ago I became eligible for healthcare via my wife’s employers scheme and 3 months ago had mri on both knees. 
I had an arthroscopy on right  knee 4 weeks ago and 2 large items were removed and surgeon felt that the rest of knee was in good shape overall.
the mri on my left knee showed arthritis had totally ruined the inside area of knee and that he felt a ukr would help massively. When we met for the arthroscopy on my other knee I explained that I was concerned about the ukr and given that I was 58 and all I want is to be pain free and be able to walk distances with my family and there seem to be lots of more post op problems after ukr, I suggested a tkr.
the surgeon is happy to do whatever I want, does anyone have any thoughts that may help me decide on best course of action

"This is a typical list of do/don't activities following a TKR...
Allowed activities: • Walking • Slow dancing • Stationary or non-stationary bicycle • Bowling • Golf • Low impact aerobics • Croquet • Swimming • Shuffleboard • Horseshoes 
Allowed activities with some experience: • Hiking (mild to moderate) • Rowing • Cross Country skiing • Stationary skiing (Nordic Trac) • Faster walking • Tennis (non-competitive) • Certain weight machines • Ice skating
Activities not recommended: • Handball • Squash • Rock climbing • Soccer • Singles Tennis • Volleyball • Football • Gymnastics • Lacrosse • Hockey • Basketball • Jogging • Running
Probably not recommended: • Roller Blading • Inline skating • Downhill skiing 
Shuffleboard?  Really?  Just shoot me now...
Notice that all the non-recommended activities involve high impact to the knee as well as the potential for severe twisting of the joint.  For most people, this is no problem.  However...
For those of us with athletic, and especially competitive, inclinations, it's like a death sentence.  I know.  I played competitive hockey for 44 years.  After a hip replacement, four fused vertebrae and now the TKR, well, obviously a game winning slapshot goal from the ""point"" ain't gonna happen again...ever.  I'm not even supposed to get on my rollerblades again (screw it...I'm doing that...I don't care...it's my reward at 1 year post op).
If you used to run, now you have to walk.  If you used to play singles tennis, now it's only doubles.  Get the idea?  That old competitive life is gone...goodbye.  And why?  Because that new knee with a 15-20 year potential lifespan will disintegrate in THREE if you go back to your old ""weekend warrior"" activities.  Oh...I'll just get another knee.  WRONG!  Really bad idea.  A revision is NEVER as good as the first one...ever.  And do you really want to deal with all that pain...for the rest of your life?
Put away the pride and vanity.  Remember what happened to the evil Walter Donovan in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade...
""He chose poorly."" - The Grail Knight
I think the old guy put it perfectly...

"I just felt I had to post today to offer some reassurance to anyone going through a knee replacement or if you have recently had this procedure done.
First off, I am a fairly fit 60 year old woman who had valgus knee which very quickly became an issue, painful and frequently 'giving way' when out walking. I was told by my Consultant that I really would need a new knee; on hearing this I almost passed out as I had no idea my knee was in such a state. Years of running; hill walking; gym etc. had clearly taken their toll. Anyway, with no other option I decided to go for it, albeit with great trepidation.
Let me be clear, I had no idea how brutal this operation would be, it is very painful, not least in my case as I could not tolerate any painkillers and had to get through this on paracetamol only. I honestly thought I was going to die.
First few weeks I could barely bend or straighten my knee. My knee really felt stuck for weeks and I was getting really down, I never get down like that. I have worked my very hardest at exercising, staying positive (most of the time) and having the odd glass of wine when I needed a cheer up. The information on here from people like Chico Marx has been invaluable.
Anyway, I just wanted to say that I had many issues including low blood pressure; vomiting; being mildly depressed; intolerance to painkillers; night sweats; extremely dry mouth etc. I could go on but I'll stop there. Four months on and I am now seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Keep exercising although you won't feel like it, stay positive and it will start to get better, it just takes time. Good luck to all you folks out there going through this, it's horrible but you will get there and thanks to all the posters on here for the support, you have helped get me through this.

"HI
I am so new to all this so I really hope someone can help.I had a partial knee replacement 4 weeks ago. The op went well and it is actually my second one. However my first one 2.5 years ago had complications and I  had to have the same op twice on the same knee
But moving on I seemed to have forgotten how painful it is at night and how depressing it is in the day.I am getting up doing my exercise, showering and moving around, but I am at such a loss.
I am 54 and normally work full time. I am under real pressure to go back to work and for my mental state I know that would be good for me. I just feel so down and wake up every morning (Well most) regretting having it done.
As I said I am new to this so sorry if it does not make sense. I know it is for the best as my other knee is good although sometimes still painful.
I am on quite strong painkillers, blood thinning injections. Just need hope that I am not the only person feeling like I have a bad decision
I know I feel better just for sharing this, I am trying to be positive in front of my family but am beginning to show the cracks.
Thank you for hopefully replying.

"I had TKR some 19 months ago and have suffered what I can only describe as extreme pain caused by something scraping against raw flesh when I bend at the walk. I can bend when sitting, straighten etc but as soon as I put weight on by walking this scraping/rubbing occurs and I cannot endure walking for long. I have at long last been allowed an ultrasound with the above result. Up until now my consultant has dismissed my worries and urged me to exercise which has not helped at all.

"Hi everyone. Today I hit my 3 month mark post bilateral knee replacement. Boy, it's been a long, slow hard road. I am doing well I think, as far as my knees go but now my lower back is taking center stage. I've had lower back problems for a long time but it was under control. I know the shift in my new alignment has caused new irritation in my lower back and pelvis. But I am also wondering if having an epidural during my surgery caused more problems for my lower back. It seems they gave me the shot right where I have massive nerve issues. Does anyone know if there is a risk for epidurals causing any kind of damage? And if so, can one recover from it?  I've never had one before until my surgery. Thanks in advance for your input~

However at a physio check they said I only had 85 degree bend and should go back and see the surgeon.  I now have MUA  scheduled for next week plus keyhole to hoover up the debris.  It was explained some people are unlucky to get scar tissue that sets like cement.  Has anyone else had this done in the UK and is it successful.  Will I be able to cycle straight away?

"Hi all
I have just had a medial partial knee replacement 5 weeks ago (left knee). However June 2017 I had the same operation on the right knee. So two PKR's.
I am looking for anyone's experience on this procedure. I know the recovery is very similar, my physio says in his experience partials can be more painful as they have to knit with more of you.
i have definitely found it to be excruciating in both instances. My problem is the first knee at ten months still hurts. If I poke it, it's like a toothache, it seems to be getting worse. I don't remember it being this sore after 6 months. Commen sense tells me it is because it is having to do all the work for the newly operated knee. But there is that element of doubt that this is here to stay. I would like to know if anyone has had the same. Walking is very painful and prior to all this walking was my life.
thanks for all your input on this forum it's very enlightening.

"Had TKR 3 weeks ago followed by a knee brace to stop my knee bending due to bleeding partly caused by blood thinners. Had a PECO fitted for just over a week and got rid of everything last Tuesday. Doing well walking and doing little jobs around the place.
Problem is pain right down left side of left knee which I am putting down to trauma, but struggling to do exercises as everything seems very stiff, but I can get the back of my leg down straight and touch the inside of my leg when flat on the bed. After exercises I get feelings of electric shocks on my knee and don't know what to do, they can go on for 15 mins and start up again 2 hours later. Any advice please.

"I just had my acl reconstructed (hamstring graft) for the second time along with lateral meniscus repair using anchors around 2 weeks ago. I was given exercises the day after to bend the knee as far as I can, foot pumps and quad tensing. But I’ve been reading that you’re not supposed to bend your knee after a meniscal repair? I’ve been bending it to past 90 degrees, will this have caused damage? My knee hasn’t been more irritated than usual. Also I was partial weight bearing (in a simmer splint) but a couple days ago my surgeon told me not to weight beat at all for the next month. Am I likely to already have damage? Thank you so much!

"Im 18 i believe i got this pain after maybe jumping/landing awkwardly while playing basketball sometime in December of 2017. I feel the pain right below my left kneecap. I admit when i first started feeling the pain I continued to play basketball and the pain did not elevate but felt the same. I've gone to 2 doctors to ask about my knee and both times they said nothing seems to be wrong with it. There are no signs of swelling and my ACL and MCL are fine. I got an x-ray on it and the doctor said he did not see anything wrong with it. I can play with the pain however I want to make sure that this doesnt hurt me in the long run  especially because i jump using my left leg. Sometime late February i played basketball less frequently ,but i still played sports that do not put stress on my knee. Yesterday I decided to play basketball and once again the pain was still there. I think it may be something wrong with my patellar tendon. Whenever I flex my patella i feel something pop towards the bottom of my knee cap. I have no idea what it is and sometimes i hear the sound sometimes i do not. 
Please help me so i can get back on the court and take some ankles. Thank you.

"I am almost 7 months after first TKR. At first physio session I asked cause of thigh pain and was told it was likely due to use of tornaque? Whenever standing in shower or standing anywhere, within couple minutes I feel pins and needles in foot ( which also starts going knumb) and severe pain in upper leg, back of thigh and glute. Continuing to stand or if walking more than say 100m becomes increasingly more painful forcing to sit for temporary respite.
Pain during the night can usually be accommodated by seeking alternative posture with pillow between knees.
I am keenly interested to know if similar problems are/have been experienced by others and what remedies can be tried. I see consultant in 6 weeks (TKR on t'other leg) so can expect his response then. In meantime I am being told the ongoing pain is most likely caused by sciatic nerve being agrivated/unsettled/disturbed? This is the link I'm wanting to explore, please? Thanks.

"Hi
I'm 12 weeks post TKR, I had a manipulation last Tuesday, they got a bend of 130 deg, the following day at PT I could only get a bend of 90 deg. As the week has gone on the stiffness is back and I'm exercising constantly as I'm afraid it's going the same way as before the manipulation where I had practically had no bend. Does this stiffness ever go? I thought once I had the manipulation i would be getting back to normal but the pain has been horrendous after and the swelling and heat on my knee is so bad I rang the hospital, they just said it was normal as they had to break a lot of fibros tissue, I'm scared it's come back. Anyone had this same problem? I have Hydrotherapy tomorrow and physio on Friday.

"So, about 5-6 months ago I had a minor meniscus tear in my knee. 
Physiotherapist said it wasn't a 'bad' tear as I still had fairly good movement and the pain, although uncomfortable, wasn't too bad. It began to heal pretty quick and in a month or so I was moving around fairly well on it. I had no surgery, no scans, no injections - just ice, massage and physiotherapy. 
Over the last few months I began running, weights and wrestling again, gradually upping the intensity. 
About 3 weeks ago I went over on the same leg (whilst wrestling) and felt a shock of pain go through my knee - suffice to say I spent the next few days hobbling around and icing it. 
I think I've re torn it. It's fairly tender to touch (perhaps a 3 out of 10 on the pain spectrum), can't bend my knee fully and I can't straighten it properly, either (probably 10% reduction in full movement).
Like the first time I did it, the pain isn't excruciating like I've heard some people say when they've torn their meniscus, so I'm presuming it's a small tear again. 
Anyone else ever re tear their meniscus? Had a similar experience? 
If there is no progression in the next week or so (that'll be around the 4-5 week point) I'll go to the Docs.

"Hey all. What are everyone experiences for recovery times on a meniscus tear repair?
I had 2 tears - both repaired and also some of my (discoid) meniscus shaved. I am now 7 weeks post OP - I can walk with minimal limp, climb stairs and also come down them (still a little wobbly coming down). I have also just been cleared for stationary bike riding, and range of movement is really good so all in all I'm pretty happy with progress. My leg did have significant muscle wastage before surgery though and I was non weight bearing for 3 weeks post OP so I am still building the muscle back slowly.
However, still have some effusion on my knee and it is still a little tender/numb like on the lateral side where there are a couple of incisions and the lateral side of my knee is still very stiff with some occasional sharp pains which radiate around the area (which was behind my knee).
Seeing my physio tomorrow for my regular appointment and I will ask them about this but hopefully this is normal in my recovery - how has it been for everyone else?

"Had TKR about 7 months ago and have had a rough recovery. I had a small lump on the outside of the knee prior to surgery that my surgeon wasn't concerned with. Well, the lump has tripled in size but still my surgeon wasn't concerned. Went for a second opinion and that surgeon wasn't concerned either. I got so annoyed with this lump that I finally convinced my doctor for an ultrasound. Just got the results back to find out I have a fluid filled sac on the outside of my new knee. Anyone experience this and what did you do about it? It's definitely causing pain and limiting the motion of my new knee. I just can't believe two knee surgeons didn't pick up on this.

"Had my right knee replaced 10/16 - recovering normally.  In 11/16 i was doing yardwork when i experienced great pain and swelling.  I called my dr he said, ice, elevate.  I couldn't do anything to alleviate the pain.  I ended up going to the ER and was diagnosed with a bakers cyst.  For 10 weeks following that my knee would have ""epidsodes""  i'd feel a pain across the top of the knee and it would be hard to bend - this happened 1,2,3,4 times a week.  Went back to dr, said just part of the healing, hang in there, etc.  After 12 weeks i went back to Dr and demanded an MRI and a bloodtest to rule out infection.  Blood work came back negative.  MRI showed tendonitis in the pateller and the quad and a bakers cyst.  Basically go back to PT.  SO i went to a new PT.  For 6 weeks no episodes - great!  A month ago today i was putting something in the oven and i felt something.  Knee has been swelling up and has everyday sometimes 2-3 times.  I ice, I use a portable tens unit but it is non-stop.  Sometimes it is so bad I can't bend it.  I even went to another dr and he is at a loss.  Suggested a Bonescan but also said to ""hang in there"" till the one year mark cuz the Bonescan may show warm on a 6 month old knee.  Basically told me to go back to my original dr - I'm at a loss - i've been to the dr 3 times in the past 3 weeks.  Help!

"I had 4 knee surgeries in 10 years: 2 on the right (ACL replacement and patella tendon repair) and 2 on the left (ACL replacement and medial meniscus repair). PT after all of my surgeries was routine except my last one which was an ACL replacement on my left knee. PT was way more painful and unlike my previous ACL replacement, the vast majority of my pain was on the lateral side. It felt like something was being stretched beyond what is normal when I bent it past 90 degrees (where my knee touches my butt) or extended completely to 180 degrees. When I asked my doctor and PT, they both said it was likely a slight build up scar tissue that needed to be loosened up and it should go away once I completed PT. I completed PT and eventually, the pain became background noise like any other little ache. I began playing sports and working out as usual and the pain was just a dull ache or unnoticeable until about a year ago. I am a little more than slightly bowlegged, always have been, and I've noticed that my left leg does not ""bow"" like it used to because the lateral side of my knee is so tight. It's starting to create problems in how I walk and workout. I've also noticed that I can no longer bend it past 90 degrees without severe pain. Like during PT 3 years ago, there is a overstretch type feeling and it takes some serious painful but bearable stretching to get it to extend 180 degrees and honestly it never gets to 180 degrees. I've tried doing heal and wall slides (learned from PT) to increase my range of motion but they are so painful that I can't complete a single rep. Also, if I sit for too long with my knee bent, when I stand, there is so much pain that I can hardly walk. If I stand for long periods of time, I don't feel any pain but the second I attempt to bend my knee to sit or stretch or walk, yep, lateral pain. Cycling and swimming are the only workouts I can do where the pain is bearable which is limiting during winter/bad weather. I cannot lift any type of leg weights or do martial arts anymore. I've seen 2 doctors (different from the one who performed my surgeries as he's retired) and they both said it was arthritis (runs in my family; I'm only 30 by the way). Their solutions were to throw pills at it, for me to stretch more and for me to perform more range of motion exercises. I am incredibly flexible and have never had an issue with tightness anywhere in my body except this dang knee. I also don't think its arthritis because the pain isn't in my joints at all, which I emphasized to both of them to no avail. The next doctor I go to, I want to be prepared for what to say/ask so I don't get brushed off. Any help, suggestions, advice any of you might have would be greatly appreciated.

I just broke my knee cap!
4 weeks post surgery– after working almost a full day, then going to the gym, I thought, well I’ll walk the dogs before icing, I’m doing so well, so, off we go.  I’m feeling a little sore, but that’s not unusual with TKR, right? 
Anyway, I’m just walking along and the dog's galloping around like usual, and veers over and bumps me right on the knee from the behind/side (really not even hard - he's not even a big dog).  Just as I say “no!” I feel the knee shift out of joint then back in, then a rush of pain. I collapse on the trail and scream and cry for a bit (I know I’m screwed and my TKR recovery is screwed).  
So, I broke my knee cap somehow.  The good news is my Knee Replacement parts and connections seem unaffected according to the xrays.  The bad news is 6 week recovery for the knee cap (after surgery to fix it), then I can get back to recovery from the TKR.
I”ll see my surgeon on Monday, to confirm or change the above ER diagnosis, and to schedule surgery.
Bitter.

"My surgeon didn't come to see me until 36 hours after performing surgery on me.  As such, the floor nurses left me in the leg immobilizer used to transfer the patient from the OR bed to the post op bed, and then finally the bed in your room.  They wouldn't remove it until my surgeon arrived to look at me knee.  After approximately 6 hours I began to feel a pinching and burning feeling that was so intense that I repeatedly called in the nurse and begged for her to loosen the apparatus or take it off completely!  She would not, saying it was for the Dr. to do; and that he would soon be there.  This went on for 30 more hours, and my being in the worse pain I've EVER been in.  When the Dr. arrived (9:30pm, on day 2 post op), he immediately asked ""Why are you still in the leg immobilizer"", I answered with a curt 'ya, why am I?""  Yes, I was UPSET to say the least.  In short, these ""friction blisters"" as he called them, were a result of being left in the leg immobilizer for too long, and my leg swelling, doing PT in it, etc...  He was visibly upset with nursing staff.  But, where was he for 30 plus hours - not checking on me that's for sure!  The blisters were big, thick, painful, and full of puss and blood.  They were very close to my incision, and as a result, ended up giving me an infection.  My physical therapy was delayed in how much I could do, thus putting me behind in my bend and straightening, and thus heading me towards needed further potential surgeries.  I also could have lost my prosthesis or leg from infection if my PCP hadn't addressed what he wouldn't do in a timely manner.  He has also didn't prescribe anything for the burns, or even how I should be caring for them at home.  What a mess!  And the pain!  Oh my!  I was already in pain from the surgery, so the burns were only adding to it, as they popped and drained, and refilled, and popped and drained over and over!
I'm adding photo's so you can get an idea of what they looked like.  Has anyone else had this post-op problem, and if so, how was it treated.  I also need to know what kind of pain medications have been used by those having TKA in the hospital, and what they were sent home with.  Please help!  I'm a mess!

"Just thought I'd share:
Well it's 3.5 weeks out, and I have to say I'm pretty happy. I've been rotating my feet on the exercycle at a seat height my good leg can barely do, the swelling is way down, I'm down to half a Norco pill 3x a day (well I'm trying that today) along with motrin, and I have actually been sleeping a bit better!
I guess I would say to really work on that range of motion from the beginning, and ice and elevate. And have a great surgeon. I'm lucky I have a part time job that is very flexible that involves mostly working on a computer or going to meetings, both of which I can do with leg elevated. I did cheat a little and started driving since work is only 5 minutes away and on back roads.
I even went on a 5 hour flight, walked through the airport without assistance, without too much trouble.
As for medication, do take enough to manage the pain, don't try to tough it out!  I tried to do without the opioids but when I went to the 2 week check up, they put me back on because they could see the pain was interfering with ROM.
anybody out there have a goal to run again, or backpack, or play Ultimate Frisbee again?  I asked my PT, and she didn't really bat an eye, so maybe things are changing.
I feel lucky.

"I was in a sporting accident, and have walked with a cane since I was 17 because of this. I'm coming up on 23 now, had a doctor diagnose me with IT Band Syndrome when I was 20. With rest, the recovery time is supposed to be 4-8 weeks, and I have done that and some amount of physical therapy, yet the problems have not gone away.
I'm currently jobless and homeless so I cannot go to a doctor or hospital for assistance because I have no money and no insurance. Is it possible for IT Band Syndrome to not recover after months of physical therapy and consistent rest?

"I have an acute medial meniscus tear of the right knee and an acute lateral meniscus tear of the right knee.  I have been in pain for about 8 months.  Recently, I had a really bad Urinary Track Infection and was literally off my feet for 4 days and 4 nights.  As a result, all of my swelling went down in my knee and I have no pain to speak of.  I have Knee Arthroscopy scheduled in 3 weeks, and now I do not know if I should proceed with surgery for a knee that is not hurting.  What are your opinions?  Do you think the pain will come back rather quickly or maybe not at all.  I just do not know how I should proceed.

I recognize we’re all different but I’m wondering a few things on an average: how long before all swelling is gone? Pain level is not too bad. Ibuprofen and ice mostly control it but how long before the pain in lower portion of incision is gone? When oh when will energy level return and ability to sleep more than 4 hours?

Apart from that have little pain but a lot of stiffness. Currently walking around home with no aids but use one only when out. Has anyone experienced MUA, manipulation under anaesthetic?

"Hi all - 1st time I've posted and looking for advice please before I lose my mind!
 January 5th - something so simple, slipped getting into my car and twisted my knee really bad, fast forward to Feb 15th and Im having knee surgery for what turned out to be a double meniscus tear on a discoid meniscus (lateral). They repaired it.
 Between January and up to the surgery I was unable to walk without my leg buckling, and I was only allowed to start weight bearing again only 1 week ago. My leg has wasted away considerably and its really tough trying to walk any kind of distance without a sharp pain in the knee (which is subsiding a bit now) and up the back of my hamstrings. I don't feel like I am making any progress at all, I used to be so active and would walk miles every day but I have been house bound for almost 3 months and I really need to get out.
 I honestly thought that once I was able to start weight bearing again I would be able to at least get some strength back, at least enough to start walking decently again - I dunno is 1 week just too soon for me to be worrying about this? Does anyone have any tales or advice that they have had when trying to rehab the leg? I am attending physio once a week but I need some reassurance that I'm on the right track (I hope I am).
 thanks all - hope you can help.

"What advice on having a MUA after TKR. Had my TKR op on Jan 19th this year.. now 9 week post op and only have 75 - 80 ROM. Saw my consultant on 22nd March and he suggested that a MUA might be a good thing for me as I am not getting the ROM that I need to get back to work full time. I am 65 fairly fit guy and my work is med to heavy labouring types of work...so I need good knee movement and strength. My question is for anyone that had the MUA and what was the results of having it. I would appreciate any advice and/or information that will help me make up my mind about having this procedure done or not.

I'm now 7 weeks post op and started physio last week. They are pleased with my progress although my bend is better than my extension.
Anyway, once again I have been reminded that this is a ""2 steps forward, 1 step back recovery."" I went for a lovely 30 minute stroll yesterday and as a result my leg is swollen an inch more today and my vicious ankle pain has returned. Its hard to know what to do to do right. Icing and elevating today but feeling a bit frustrated!!

"saw doctor last week and he sent me for ultrasound. I had seroma on back of knee causing knife like pain and I have severe fluid on my knee,  I went to see doctor today 3-26-18 and I called in advance that I needed a cortisone shot for pain. The doctor was going to get me nonsteroidal pain medication but the specialty pharmacy sent anabolic steroids which I decided to use and it caused me to get extremely nauseated.  Ended up in ER from the medication.  I wanted to get a steroid shot for my TKR pain and I called doctor office and I was told I could get one with my extreme pain. I went toda, 3-26-18 at 9:30am.  I was to see the doctor but a PA showed up and I told him I had extreme pain.  He said he could tell my leg was swollen.  I told him I was in extreme pain crying all of the time.  He said there was nothing I could do. I left and went to ER with a high BP, 102 temperature and when they pushed on my knee, infection poured out of the incision.  So I will need another surgery.  I am not going back to my doctor.  On IV antibiotics in hospital until I can get a doctor to look at my knee.  So all of you out there on blogs I read telling people it will get better need to be aware we are not all the same!

"About 4 years ago, in an effort to wake up a little and get some blood flow during a coffee break from a particularly sleep inducing work meeting, I walked into the hallway and starting doing a few basic squats. I have always been a moderately athletic person, and no stranger to squats so I thought nothing of it. During these basic squats I felt a very sharp pain below my patella. This pain has never completely gone away so 4 years later I am still struggling with the same issues.
The pain is not constant, it doesn't hurt while sitting nor kneeling. It only hurts in my right knee at a very specific angle while transitioning from a squated or seated position to a standing position (or vise versa). I can do weighted squats if I lean back and put all of the weight on my heels. For some reason that does not hurt, but the second I do a squat or anything similar with weight on the front of my feet, about half way through the transition I experience that very sharp and very sudden pain.
I practice tae Kwon doe (a martial art composed of 80% kicks) with little to no pain and I can go many weeks or months without much pain, but recently while playing tennis the pain returned quickly, suddenly, and sharply as I tried to backpeddle for the ball.
I truly apologize for the very long post but I have been battling this pain for years and Everytime it returns it takes weeks of light use and Ibuprofen to suppress it again. Does anyone have any idea what my injury may be or steps I can take to repair or just suppress the pain?
I have seen a medical doctor (no help really) but not a specialist.
Thank you!

"Hi all!
I’m 10 days post op with my 2nd TKR (other one was 5 months ago).   I spent 2 nights in hospital then home where I had prepared well with toilet surround, grabber and lots of other conveniences that I learned last time round that would be helpful. 
Until a couple of days ago I was almost narcoleptic so tired and falling asleep for a few hours at a time but the last couple of days has been totally the opposite.  I’m suffering from tremendous irritability in the operated leg I just can’t keep it still and have to keep moving it which is so painful. The meds are not really touching the pain much and I just can’t seem to get it in a comfortable position that will allow me to sleep.  Yesterday I stayed up instead of going back to rest in bed after my exercises, it was under the mistaken belief that by staying up I woukd be so shattered last night that I woukd sleep better. 
That didn’t work and the hours go by so very slowly in the night. I was also trying not to disturb my other half but the more I tried not to move the more I needed to then broke out in a sweat as it was so painful and I was so very tired and became tearful which I know happens but then just ended up feeling sorry for myself.  
I’ve had a strict word with myself and I’m not giving into that again I just want to rest comfortably even for just an hours sleep for a while. 
Has anyone experienced this weird irritability? If so how were you able to deal with it please? 
Thanks all

"Its been a long couple months but I finally have a diagnosis!! After seeing three doctors, I finally sought an opinion from an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in knee joints.
I have a flap tear in my meniscus, the tear is right behind my kneecap which is causing my kneecap to pop in and out of place. Which is extremely painful, also my kneecap now normally sits slightly shifted to the right of my knee joint instead of where it should be, and I have developed arthritis.
Has anyone had a similar injury? Or had to deal with a flap tear? The doctor proposed a ""tune up"" type surgery where he would go in arthroscopically and removed the damaged cartilage and smooth over the bone spurs and rough patches that I've developed from not have most of my meniscus. Has anyone had this type of surgery before? I'm interested if it helped to delay the TKR. This is the ultimate goal, I'd like to be at least in my fifties by the time I need to have my knee replaced. I am 28 now and have already had two ACL reconstructions and they removed most of the my meniscus.

" Hi everyone. I am brand new on this forum  so I apologize if this has been addressed before. But I doubt it has since I can’t seem to find anything online about it. I am having severe sharp pain on top of my kneecap and just below.  This pain is the worst when I try to do an exercise where I place a pillow under my knee and attempt to straighten my leg via lifting my heel off the bed. I am completely unable to do this exercise because the pain is so bad. I am wondering if anyone else has had this experience and if so did you ever find out what it was and did it ever go away and approximately how long did it take? I’m going to give it another few days but if I see no improvement I will have to go back to the doctor before my regular Check up.  I  do not want it to hinder my recovery. I hope it’s a simple thing.   Any help on this matter would be appreciated. Thanks Linn

"Hi everyone I'm new on here but have been regularly reading the discussions ,which have helped me a lot . November 1st I had a full knee replacement  8 weeks later I still wasn't getting the bend I should of been getting ,went to see surgeon who wasn't to worried and told me to carry doing what I was doing exercises,pain relief and ice which I did  , 4 months later I still wasn't getting it think it was around 80degrees and still quite a lot of pain ,by this time I had finished with the physio at the hospital and was on a waiting list to see the NHS physio , I felt I was wasting time so I got a private physio who was helping me to try and get the bend ,
my routine appointment came for me to see the surgeon after about 14 weeks post op 
he took one look and said he would manipulate it but no guarantees .
I had the manipulation with spinal eperdural the. Surgeon said he got a 40 degree better bend and said it was really well worth doing it , afterwards I went on the CPM machine for 45hours constant which was terribly uncomfortable,And was then allowed home with pain relief  ,what I'm asking is if anyone has experienced this it has been a lot more painfull than the knee replacement 
im now back on crutches the pains terrible and I'm now 11 days after the manipulation ,
i have seen the physio since and he said my bend is measuring 90degrees now and to keep up with the exercises ,I am so fed up with the whole experience I feel it's never going to be right 
I have up and down days but still having a lot of pain and still struggling to get this dreaded bend .
sorry to have gone on so much but would just like to know if what I'm experiencing is normal

I saw my consultant today who has requested a MUA next week, but I got the impression he wasn't very Happy with me , he said an MUA is rare , he made me feel as though I've been sitting on my bum doing nothing for 10 weeks , the PT didn't try to bend it till day 5 in hospital which is why I only got a 45 degree bend . I ended up apologising to him for having to do the MUA . Is it that rare?

"What have people’s experiences been of using a knee brace like the Donjoy ones prior to surgery?  Have people found that they help to delay the necessity to have a knee replacement?  It’s a big investment but could potentially be worth it.  I know I am going to need a replacement (and am on the waiting list) but my pain level has been improving in recent months since a suspected ruptured Baker’s Cyst so my most recent discussion with my consultant has led to consideration over the next few months of whether I can get my pain and mobility  to a level I feel is manageable and therefore delay the replacement for a while longer.

"Hi from across the ""Pond"".
My wife's surgeries are really getting tiresome but Anne is a real trouper through all this.
Over the last year+:
Started with PKR with the complication of one of the closing staples deciding to find its way around the back of her knee some place and lodge. Also he removed a large cyst under the skin that left a big hole under the skin.
Surgeon didn't like the wayward staple and the fact that the wound was draining for so long so he thought he would go in and open the knee and clean out the operated area and start her on IV Ancef for a month. Couldn't get to the staple so he said: ""Don't worry about it, people live with foreign objects in their bodies with no ill effects.""
After the month, as things were getting better, her knee swelled up, turned red and became infected so he went in again and cleaned everything out, packed the wound with drug eluting beads and another round of IV Ancef for a month then oral cephalexin for about 3 months.
Things were looking good, went to Israel and walked all over the place, came home. Stopped the cephalexin and the knee got infected again!
Surgeon opened up the knee for the fourth time and took out the partial that was working so well (3 hour operation) fearing that there was some bug lurking on the partial. Closed up the hole that he created when he removed the cyst. Put in oversized, drug eluting wafers and more beads and stapled her up again and now we are finishing up 7+ weeks of Vancomycin. I should mention that they have never been able to culture any organism from repeated testing.
Now it's been almost 8 weeks since the last surgery and her knee was just slightly oozing and draining from a small hole for about 4 weeks. Then two weeks ago it started really pouring out to the extent that we have to change a very padded dressing twice a day. 
As soon as Anne is better, he wants to go in and to a TKR. We are going to get a second opinion as soon as we see the doctor again so we can ask him for a referral (no one will see my wife without one).
My question is: Is 7+ weeks of draining unusual? The doctor doesn't think so. nb
I'm wondering if that staple is causing all the problems and reinfections, etc.
They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over-and-over and expecting different results. This seems to be what we are doing.
The doctor says this is the first time in 14 years of doing this that he's ever had to replace a partial knee that became infected. He also says that this is the first time he, or any of his colleagues, have ever seen a wayward staple. This kind of makes me wonder if the two are related.
I'm thinking there are people out there that have gone through similar problems that could provide some advice?

"Hi all
I'm 46 days post op now. I'm doing well but have a few concerns. I was back to see the consultant and he's happy with me overall...
How long did others wounds take to fully heal?, I have two areas that aren't healed yet..he said they were stitch abscesses probably ..means I can't swim yet which I'm dying to do...I'm hopeful it will heal up soon..
Secondly I booked an appointment with a rehab therapist to get a gym programme and get going...I thought I'd be able to cycle by now. But my knee won't GO fully around...it will go forward and back a certain amount but not fully around. It's too tight yet...when could others cycle?? Am I just being impatient??
Thanks
How are all the other new kneebies doing?

Dr. discharged me with strict instructions to not put CPM over 30 degrees for 1 week. After that, slowly start moving it up. Trying to help keep scar tissue to a minimum. I went for my 2 week check up yesterday (3/15) and he was upset that my bend was only at 45. He is giving me 1 week to get to 100. I wasn't even at 100 before original tkr in October. The knee still doesn't really want to bend. PT isn't really sure what the Dr. wants from me anymore than I do. I am truly at my wits end. Any suggestions?

As my knees got worse so is the stiffness, is this a common experience for people in our condition? would this get better after the surgery?

"Hi, i fractured (non displases) my patella 5 weeks ago. 2 weeks ago i had an arthroscopy to remove some loose cartlidge and had a slightly torn medial meniscus tendon wich was trimmed.
I have been told to stay in my full leg splint/brace for another 2 weeks. The swelling in the knee is less than half what it was and there is very minimal pain if any at the moment. I'm a sign maker/installer and most of my work is up and down ladders and on my feet all day with lifting.
My question is after i start my rehab/physio what would be a rough time frame before i can get back to full duties at work, and what knee braces if any would i need after?
Any advise is good advise!

"Recently passed the 18 month post TKR marker. Thanks to a gifted surgeon, pain free living gets better everyday. It was a pleasant surprise to note the additional healing occurring over the last six months. During those months, kneeling and stair climbing has become much easier, and knee strength has increased dramatically. Able to consistently do swats with weight bar, stair climber machine, and speed walking without any discomfort. My ongoing recovery routine includes maintaining a healthy weight along with proper nutrition, daily exercise, and sufficient rest. Also, suggest challenging yourself, try to increase your physical exercise intensity every few weeks. At 68 year old, I am blessed to have received this gift. Best wishes and the Lord's blessings on your journey to pain free living.

"I drove for the first time Tuesday! And then tonight after I let my oxycodone mellow out, I drove to the grocery store and did some shopping! Yeah, a little taste of freedom. I was in the store much longer than I wanted to be though (About an hour) and my list was small! And what started to hurt were NOT my knees, but my feet! Normally when I'm working in my kitchen, cooking or cleaning, my legs go stiff which forces me to have to lay down. But all this walking in the store, my legs did not go stiff. Just muscle fatigue and major foot pain. I'm sure this is normal. By the time I was looking for my last item on my list, I was antsy. It was Vermouth (for a new recipe). Very hard to find in the land of alcohol isles in my newly refurbished Ralphs. I went to the check out and told the lady I was in pain and could someone help me find the vermouth? I had three cheery ladies do the leg work for me and found the vermouth for me! They were my angels! Anyway, just sharing my milestone tonight. I plan on going back to church too this Sunday. Hopefully, I will feel well enough in the morning to do so.

"Hi everyone. I can't believe I am seeking help you would think I'm an old hand but I'm currently depressed.
I know it's early days I had my right medial partial knee replaced 10 days ago (my left knee was 8 months ago same operation) but I am in so much pain. It was bad last time but this is worse. I came home with Nefopam and paracetamol but have since changed to Tramadol and paracetamol four times a day. I time my exercises for an hour after taking the meds but it it is still excruciating. I have almost a straight leg but hardly any bend and when getting up from sitting I feel dizzy with the pain it is so stiff I can hardly walk. The biggest question is iwhy does it hurt even when at rest, throbbing in the night and very sore to touch. I am icing every two hours or so even through the night. Last time the Tramadol worked fine and I took them for four weeks before stopping.
Has anyone else experienced the same? Any suggestions as to what I should be doing? My staples come out tomorrow so is it just a matter of time and I'm misremembering. My other knee isn't pain free at eight months but I've put that down to taking the strain for the last three months.
I have seen on here that most partial knee patients have had a good recovery so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I still exercised twice a day before my op to build up strength. Now it's heel slides four times a day but I can't manage very many.
Sorry for the lengthy story I'm just upset and depressed really. Any advice would be appreciated.
thank you.

"I had a knee osteotomy on January 24, 2018 on the right knee.  The doctors orders were non weight bearing for 8 weeks.  Also no bending until approved by the doctor.  I have seen him 3 times since surgery. 
I had home PT for the first month since I can't drive with my right knee affected.  They released me because they couldn't do anything more until the doctor approved weight bearing and flexing. 
March 12 I saw him and he tried to bend the knee it is locked.  He stated PT was supposed to be bending it starting at 2 weeks.  They never received the orders to do so.  I was never told by him to bend it in the 2 prior visits I had.  Nor did he try bending it.
I am very worried I will be looking at another procedure to bend the knee.  They told me they may need to put me under on a machine to bend it.   I am doing exercises to try and bend it.  Last night I went to the Y and used the hot tub and was able to get a decent bend, but not 90 degrees.  I think I might be getting about 30 degrees max. I am trying to get home PT again. 
I have asked him to submit a new order for PT, since their PT cannot see me for another 2 weeks.  He is not responding to my calls.  Escalated it to Patient Relations.  
Has anyone else had this issue and does anyone have any suggestions?  How long an I expect to get to the point to be able to bend enough to reliably be able to drive?
Thanks for any help that can be provided.

Always had problems with my right knee, throughout childhood I had something called ‘osgood schlatter’ disease then only a couple of years ago my knee swelled up and was hot and I got diagnosed with ‘osteochondritis’ then only last Friday was I climbing into bed and as I’ve put my knee on the bed and gone to get in it completely dislocated and I was in the most agony I’ve ever been in in my entire life for 4 hours why I waited for paramedics. I’ve had an MRI done and an x-ray and I’m just waiting to hear back, I’ve got physio booked for in 1 months time because that’s the next available appointment but the trouble is is that my sick note runs out in 1 months time, it’s the 1st time I’ve ever needed one in my life (I’m 25) and I am a children’s party Host, baby massage instructor and sensory and messy play coordinator...

"Hi all, I had a RTKR 5 weeks ago. The first few days were brutal but after that I seemed to settle into a pattern of healing, never totally pain free bu manageable with medication.
Over the past few days however, I have been experiencing much more pain, from my foot to my thigh and especially in my ankle. I'm not walking as well as I was and I'm feeling really down in the dumps as a result of this set back.
I don't see my consultant until 12weeks post op and I havent started physio yet so I have no one to ask. I am taking co codamol 3/4 times daily and 50mg tramadol sr night and morning.
Should I be concerned?
Does this sound like normal recovery pattern?
Am I taking enough pain relief?

I use a cross trainer, leg press and rower twice a week and attend physio gym class also.  I want to cycle but am too scared to push the pedal just a bit more to get the full rotation.

"A week ago I was doing some exercises (mainly star jumps and lunges) which I managed ok at the time.
However the next day my left knee started to become quite painful all around and underneath the kneecap, mainly at the inner side of the kneecap but also some on the outer side. There was also pain at the back of the knee on the outer side. The pain was quite sharp at the back of my knee, and a more of an ache around the kneecap. There didn't appear to be any noticeable swelling.
There is also some popping at the top knee joint and at the area on the back of my knee when I walk or extend it, and each time it pops there is new pain in those areas.
I also found when I lie down and pull my knee up against my chest, there is a spot on the inner side of the knee just next to my kneecap that I could manipulate with my fingers. It's a bit like pressing down on a plastic bottle where it pushes in and then pops back out again. If I do this a few times some dull pain starts spread to the area. The same spot also pops and catches when I'm walking.
I went to the GP 3 days ago and he put me through a range of leg movements which I could do ok, but it was also painful the the same areas. He said he wasn't sure and it may be split cartilage, and to give it 3 weeks to see if it heals.
But I'm finding it difficult to walk properly at the moment as my knee is both painful and stiff and I'm wondering if I should seek further medical help. Does anyone have any suggestions what the issue could be?
I've attached 3 photos:
Image 1 - The area I feel pain around my kneecap.
Image 2 - The area at the back of my knee that is painful, and pops when I'm walking.
Image 3 - The spot next to my kneecap that I can manipulate with my fingers, and also pops when I'm walking.
Thank you,
Michael

"Wow...March 10th, 2018...already?  Where did those two years go?  Oh yeah...I've been trying real hard to forget all that crap!!!  The end result?
IT WAS ALL WORTH IT!!!!!!!  BIG TIME!!!!!
Eight months after the TKR, I got spinal stenosis which put a big crimp in my rehab.  LLIF fusion in March of 2017...then a wrist repair in November and an L2-L4 spinal laminectomy this January.  Yes...more crimps in my rehab.  Still in a brace but started yoga and looking to resuming the gym work in April for my quads.
Unbelievably, I can climb stairs two at a time, no holding on, so stairs are no big deal for me.  Lots of ""muscle memory"" from 45 years of hockey.  But when I try to balance on one leg at yoga?  Fuggeddaboutit.  All those muscles are still weak from two years ago.  I got more work to do.  The exercise will be a lifelong thing...abandon it and you lose all that muscle tone.  Keep up the work!!!
But the knee itself is GREAT.  Some minor cramping a few days a months...Voltaren Gel...done.  An occasional click or pop...ignore it.  Virtually zero tightness or stiffness.  Any remaining symptoms will disappear as I get the gym work done.
So...for all of you finishing one year: It keeps getting better.  Just give it time and don't stop working at it.
For those of you still in your first year: time, work and patience.  You will get there.  Stay strong.
For those ""Kneebies"" just starting out: It helps to scream into a pillow.  Take your meds ON SCHEDULE, eat healthy, hydrate, do your home exercises, ENDURE PT, ice, elevate.  One big thing: Give up all your expectation and time tables.  You CANNOT push a knee to recovery.  If you try, it just swells and sets you back. The recovery takes a year...period...accept it...own it!!!
Update done...end of line...

"I am 67 and have/had a high pain threashold I.e. kidney stones, parentitus, many surgeries. Am 5 weeks post surgery with PT 3x/wk. every visit they push m knee back further causing screaming in pain. Last Wednesday after pushing for 90% to 93% therapist said it has to be 120%. Each session leaves me in pain off the charts then two days to recover only to do it again. No one else is screaming except me. Yesterday he moved it once with me yelling in pain then again FOUR more times bragging on 103%. I can’t take any more! I understand weights, steps, treadmill etc but should I be crawling like a crab to get away? I get extremely anxious walking into therapy especially now fearing he will continue this nightmare. Everyone thinks it is all in my mind but I know it truly is killing me. No one deserves this! Please help me understand.

"Hi everyone, This is my first post. I just joined this forum yesterday. So glad I found this group. I read some posts last night and was very encouraged. I am heading into my 8th week post BTKR tomorrow. So far, everything that I had read about recovery from other resources, has not been what I am experiencing.It's been much harder than I had anticipated. I seem to be doing pretty good in some regards. I have very good ROM at 135 right leg and 130 left leg. I've always been limber and it's come in handy in my recovery. My left leg is much much weaker than my right. I walked around for 7 years with severe osteoarthritis and my legs started to lose their muscle strength. My right leg was more dominant and did all the ""leg work"". Ha ha. So, my left leg is holding back my progress. I am a 61 year old female and do not work. My husband works at home too, so he's been able to take care of me. I am very blessed to be able to have the luxury of recovering at my body's pace. Ok, here's my dilemma: I am on my second percocet refill and will be running out in the next few weeks. I am weaning off of the med because I was told to but I still have pretty severe pain and don't feel ready to not have it. I wake up in the morning feeling so terrible. It's like my entire nervous system is agitated and achy. Also, on top of my knee pain, I'm having really bad lower back pain. Mainly my pelvis, tailbone area and all those bones that make up the pelvis, are so achy. This has been a pre-existing condition for years but now it's much worse with my new alignment. Is anyone else experiencing lower back / pelvis pain? All this laying around on it sure doesn't help.  Is anyone else waking up in the mornings feeling their worst? I worry about having effective pain meds to help me through the day now that I am supposed to be weaning off the percocet. It seems a little too soon as I am still in pain. And sometimes I ache all over as if I have the flu but I don't. Any help is greatly appreciated <3

"Hi all thanks for reading.
Always had problems with my right knee, throughout childhood I had something called ‘osgood schlatter’ disease then only a couple of years ago my knee swelled up and was hot and I got diagnosed with ‘osteochondritis’ then only last Friday was I climbing into bed and as I’ve put my knee on the bed and gone to get in it completely dislocated and I was in the most agony I’ve ever been in in my entire life for 4 hours why I waited for paramedics. I’ve had an MRI done and an x-ray and I’m just waiting to hear back, I’ve got physio booked for in 1 months time because that’s the next available appointment but the trouble is is that my sick note runs out in 1 months time, it’s the 1st time I’ve ever needed one in my life (I’m 25) and I am a children’s party Host, baby massage instructor and sensory and messy play coordinator... I literally spend all day on my feet and knees, dancing about and lifting heavy stuff. After a week it’s still tight and I’m struggling to bend it. Anyone else experienced this before? If so, how long did your recovery take? Did you need surgery? Just looking for some advice please, many thanks.

"I am 7 weeks post op of TKR.  Except for the fact I feel as though I did not have a large enough prescription for pain meds post op, I was doing well until last Wednesday.  I was in the car driving grand kids for three hours, taught a class after school and attended a meeting.  The next day, I felt as though I was starting all over....without the use of pain meds. The government now regulates the # of opiates prescribed for orthopedic surgeries and I had 3 prescriptions of 30 tablets which are gone. Four days later while  I've continued therapy but still need to ice a few times a day.  I feel as though I am constantly working on the adhesions in my thigh and calf muscles.I have three more therapy sessions and then I am on my own. Is this setback abnormal? How can I avoid future setbacks?

Went to the doctor and a half plaster was put on my leg since my leg was swollen.
After 2 weeks half plaster was removed and I stayed a week without any plaster since my leg was in pain. Went and saw the doctor and was told to elevate my leg always.
I did that and the swelling stoped.
Now on 23rd march got another plaster full one now...
Just wanted to know how long does it take for a fractured knee to heal.

"Hello
First of all thank you all for the support you are offering it's really magnificent
.
My problem started on the 7th of January while I was running
I felt a pain in my right knee just under the knee cap when I land on my right foot
I stopped running for couple of days and didn't feel any pain in those rest days however when I tried to run again in the third day the pain was more pronounced and It was gradually building the further I went in my run .
I stopped running for 2 weeks but during this period of time descending the stairs gave me a feeling of slight discomfort other than that daily activities felt just fine.
After a short period of time from those 2 weeks I went for a run (I know that I shouldn't have done that) but this time around the 9th km I started feeling sharp pains in my knee I stopped and stretched but on my way back home it felt like my knee was locked and I couldn't bend it at all every descending gave me sharp pain I iced it for 20 minutes and kept it elevated after sleeping and waking up that night trying to bend my knee gave me less pain I used my hands to bend it
Once I bent it I was able to bend it and straighten it again just like normal
I went to see a doctor and he saied if you are able to bend and straighten your knee normally and do daily activities normally there's no need for a MRI scan and he prescribed me diclofenac 50mg for 10 days
.
I stopped running for about a month and started doing some leg exercises I could do squats,lunges,jumping without any pain and I used hot water heating pad 2-3 times a day
However when I tried to run again this month I felt the same pain gradually building the further I went in my run.
.
From the begging of my injury till know there's no swelling or redness in my knee at all it looks fine
.
I can't replicate the pain by touching my knee any from any angle
The only way I can replicate it is if I laid down on my stomach in bed and bent it towards me then I would feel like my whole knee hurts
.
You may ask why I didn't do a MRI scan till now well that's because I live outside of my country and I don't hqave health insurance
Just doing the scan without receiving any diagnoses would cost me about 105$
.
I'm 19 years old and I've never had knee injuries before
There's one last thing that I feel I should mention , my knees pop every time I bend them since I was 6 years old but without any pain or discomfort
.
I'm really sorry for the prolongation but I thought that I should mention everything
and I'm really sorry if there was any mistakes ,english isn't my mother language

"Hello everyone,
I am new here, this is my first post. I had ACL reconstructive surgery at a private hospital here in my country, Albania. It went well. The procedure was done with semi-tendinosis gracilis as my doctor said.
First week I could not really walk without crutches and I did not do most of the exercises...
Second week I started walking without crutches very slowly around the house, but nothing more than that. Exercises done quite abruptly, too.
After exactly two weeks, I had my first visit planned with the surgeon who operated me. I went to the hospital together with my father who accompanied me by car and I did not take crutches with me. The surgeon told me I should keep the crutches until week 6, just to be sure. They took off the stitches and cleaned the area.
The thing that made me wonder a bit though and the main reason why I am writing here is that both the surgeon and the physiotherapist who works there (he is a friend of mine) told me there is no need for me to do physiotherapy unless there are complications.
Now, I am a bit torn here. Physiotherapy would mean working with someone who's supposed to know what they're doing and should be more helpful than just the exercises they have given me + I am so busy with my daily life that most of the time I forget about the exercises..
On the other hand, a physiotherapist himself told me I don't need PT...
Just to fill it out, week 3 saw other improvements on the way. I am now able to bend my knee to 90 degrees without any trouble and extension is almost fully OK when I want to. Maybe not -10 degrees, but somewhere around -5. I have about 2-3 centimeters muscular atrophy on the thigh where the injured knee is. Week 4 closes after tomorrow and I have now been able to even conduct work (I am a photographer) for two days in a row, shot once 3 hours standing on feet almost all the time and yesterday shot for about 2 hours and a half, mostly on feet. Yes, I do rely on my healthy leg most of the time and it is more tiring than usual, but I did OK.

"Hi I had a partial medial left knee replacement 4 days ago. My second the right is now 8 months old. I know every knee is different and this one has also been scoped and straightened as I was 13 degrees bow legged. However I am really struggling with the pain. As well as the knee it seems to be my shin and more especially my lower back giving me the most trouble. Any one else experiencing this?
I am very sensitive to morphine and opioids in general being very sick with them, however last time I did seem to be slightly better with Tramadol. I came out of the hospital with Nefopam and paracetamol to take 3 times a day. This is not enough it hardly takes the edge off. I would like to know if I can supplement this with Tramadol as I have some left from before. (I came off it as soon as I could). Until I can get an appointment with the doctor your help would be appreciated.

"Hi,
I've had bilateral TKA 10 weeks ago, and recovery has had it's up and downs, but finally as many on this forum have mentioned as you approach 3 months it starts getting better.
I took another forum members advice (thanks Chico!) seriously and got off opioid pain meds (Oxycodone) this past week. And instead have iced-iced-iced. Getting off opioids really change my mental state for the better. I think I was teary and feeling sorry for myself on the pain meds. Remember to slowly wean yourself otherwise you get shakey.
Another member mentioned daily stationary bike. Absolutely great advice, and I'm lucky to have a stationary bike at home. I think that's why I was able to increase my ROM fairly quickly. My ROM is miraculously at 140 and 135, and extension 0.
I started riding my mountain bike around 7 weeks post-surgery on some flat trails near my house. Great for my mental state! Started off really short distances maximum 20 minutes, and now up to 60 minutes.
I still get tired easily, and have to rest or take it easy during the day. But I understand that'll take awhile to get over.
But with all this progress, I developed a loud clicking/popping sound in both knees at about 5 weeks. It's really annoying as it's truly loud. Every step and every movement bending my knees, I hear and feel this clicking. On my left knee, I have a double click, and I actually see my left side muscle above my knee cap bulge with each click. My surgeon had to correct my bowed legs, and I'm wondering if that has to do with it. He and his staff warned me before the surgery that many TKRs click. Well, my husband had a TKR 2 years ago and his knee does not click. Is it the prosthesis that was used? He used Smith and Nephew implants on me. I'm going to see my doc in 2 weeks, and would love to get input from other TKR patients on this.
Has anyone else had this experience where suddenly the clicking starts? Does it go away with more PT strengthening exercises?
I'm mighty frustrated as everything else seems good. And I don't see how one gets used to it when it's so loud and apparent, and I feel and hear each pop/click!

"I am so discouraged and concerned . Had partial knee replacement on right knee , lateral ( outside) of knee.Thought I was doing good . Went off pain meds after 4 days. Now back on , trouble sleeping , have terrible pain on the inside of knee . It's like a pulling or something with the ligament . Could something have happened on the other side during surgery . It only hurts when I walk on it . I wouldn't need the cane except for that . Is this all normal . My doctor doesn't send you to PT with partials but I am going to go on my own . I will need to return to work in two weeks which from the beginning my Doctor said after 4 weeks I'd be able to . I'm still so swelled up, never expected it to be like this .

Filled out my questionnaire for the surgical centre I had the knee replacement done at. How rewarding to fill out the Oxford knee score with transformed results...so different to before I had the knee replacement!
Only residue issue is its hard going down stairs, bit this is not due to the operated knee but the other one!
Now task is to keep the weight off and be fit and active!
Much easier when you can walk!

"A few days ago, I had leaned into my car to get something. My foot slipped though, I fell into the floor board and when I did, my leg got caught in the door. My leg bent sideways and there was a very loud pop, and it hurt a lot!
I mean, I was crying and trying not to scream for at least 5 minutes... Then limped to my brothers game. Oh I was grittn iron lol.
It swelled up some, hurt and ached right around the knee....left leg, inside nearest to center of body in the front. It kept burning it was cold. Slept that night, woke up with a stiff knee, pain and still limping. I couldn't extend my leg completely or lock it, or rotate the knee either direction without wincing.
Went to urgent Care, since I'm Prego and want to be sure I won't collapse one day later when I'm a balloon again... Waited 3 hours to be told just ice it. Thanks. Didn't even listen to everything I needed to say.
Anyways, I keep a compression wrap on it now almost all day, it alleviates the pain and kind of stiffens my leg in a better position. Still wake up every morning it's stiff and painful, still can't rotate it either way, and I noticed it feels like something is slipping behind my knee cap when I bend and (have to) put pressure on it. Still can't straiten or lock it.

"I recently had a knee injury from doing literally nothing. Essentially I was sitting crossed legged on the floor and I had leaned over to my left to stand up. when I felt a shift in my knee. Suddenly I was in excruciating pain, and couldn't bear any weight on my right knee. This comes twelve years after my last ACL reconstruction (2 ACL reconstructions in total) and a meniscectomy. 
?I ended up in the ER that day where they did nothing, and the doctor was too afraid to even examine my knee because I was in so much pain. Fast forward 2 months and nobody could figure out why I was in so much pain. At this point thankfully I can walk again, however only with a limp. I've already seen two doctors, the last doctor I saw was a surgeon (supposedly the best on the Island that I live on). His diagnosis was that because I no longer have a meniscus my bones have simply began to rest on each other and the motion of twisting my knee caused my bones to rub. He also said that I have developed arthritis still very little however. He said that the structure of my knee has changed drastically and I am looking at a knee replacement in the next 10 - 15 years. The doctors advice was to do PT build my strength back up (my muscles have atrophied in the last 2 months) and continue living my life until the pain has become chronic enough to do the replacement. 
?At 28 years old the prospect of having a knee replacement at 38 is terrifying! Before this most recent injury I was a an avid cyclist, loved strength training and running 5K's. My question is do I seek a second opinion? Or do I take the doctors advice and continue to do what I'm doing, until my quality of life has decreased?

"Good morning, 
I've posted a couple of times in the past about a knee injury that hasn't received any clear diagnosis. My MRI showed no structural damage, but having followed all the physical therapy protocol and more for the past 11 months, but with no improvement, I have decided to pursue exploratory surgery which will occur March 22. 
?My question is, how difficult is it to locate meniscus or ligament damage during arthroscopy? I am deciding to trust my knee surgeon even though he says the MRI's are correct 98 % of the time when they show no structural damage. I am hoping that if a minor or significant tear exists within my knee, it would be impossible to miss. And... based on how it feels like there is inherently a missing hinge within my right knee, I am quite confident that SOMETHING is deeply wrong in there. 
Thanks!

"Hello, 
53 years old, replaced left hip June 2016, and right hip Jan 2018.  Left hip great, right hip recovering well, just a bit sore yet and still a little fatigue   The new hips are so much better than old hips, and range of motion is unbelievable.   
Now I have to deal with the knee pain.  I actually had my choice of doing the right hip or right knee in January, but choose hip since recovery is quick.  Right knee is bone on bone medially and even a bit out of allighnment, left knee showing some loss of cartilage. Had a PRP injection in right knee in Sept 2017, which did help with the pain, having another injection in 2 weeks and having custom brace made for support when active.  
Dr said right knee needs to be a total, and wants a custom implant for me as I broke both femurs in college.  He said left knee would be candidate for partial.  I would like to get at least a year and a half before going thru another surgery.  
Need encouragement—just tired of pain all the time.  I am only 53, have always been very active and in fact I am almost underweight.  I still play a bit of doubles tennis, but have had to decrease play and playing at a lower level.  Depressed but forcing myself to keep going and stay active.  Ride stationary bike and do weights, no squats, and yoga. 
Anybody going thru same thing?   What works best for knee pain, tramadol, ibuprofen, Tylenol?   I shouldn’t have to give up on life at 53.

"This kind of thing has been happening to me since I was a teenager, but these past two times have been very different - especially today. An example of what can cause this to happen: If I'm sitting cross legged on the ground and I get up too quickly. Usually I can reverse my actions and put whatever it is back in place... but sometimes I have to straighten my leg and whatever it is pops back into place. These past two times have been different because straightening my leg doesn't do anything. It doesn't hurt to have my leg straight at all, but walking on it is VERY painful. The last time it happened I was able to make my way across my house to reach the phone and call my wife, but by the time I got to the phone it popped back into place. The pain subsided in about 1-2 weeks. Today I slipped in the snow and the same thing happened, but no matter how much I massage around my knee cap and painfully walk around the house, I can't get it to pop back into place. Currently I have my legs on a foot rest with a warm on my knee. There's no bruising or swelling. Also, my kneecap is front and center so it doesn't seem to be that.

I had an Osteotomy and TKR on 9.1.18 doing really well. Had to return to work very early as lone financial supporter of family so returned at 4 was post op on phased return for 2 weeks now full time. Not driving yet mainly due to adverse weather. 
125 bend -15 straight crutches only in icy conditions or 1 when really tired. Missed Physio this week as was snowed in and cut off. Been doing some exercices but honestly this week not half as much as I should have. Do not get as much rest as perhaps I should. 
Today I have pain and burning approx 2 inches above top of scar and 2 inches below it down my shin. Stabbing and burning. Not had this before. I have elevated. Ankle and foot a little swollen but not terribly. I’ve had specialist prothesis with the knee 2 sides then a long stem at top and bottom. Just wondered if anyone else has experienced this and also discolouration of the scar. It’s very soft as I use E45 cream 4 or 5 times a day but blue black colours come and go in places/ anyone had this also please. 
I’ve cut down on meds and experienced the night sweats but so tired again. 
Advise welcomed please. 
I am 60

"I'm 42 years old active female with 4 kids and own a business.  I'm always on my feet.  Had a partial knee cap replacement and 5 weeks out post surgery.  I can only bend 75 degrees at most.  My PT has really stepped up the pace and intensity.  I almost passed out in pain today with his pushing on my bend.  After a very intense hour of therapy, my knee stayed at 75, its stuck and he plans to suggest a MUA to my surgeon.  
I just want to get going with movement and exercising my leg.  My joint is weak and my quad has significantly atrophied.  
Did the MUA work, were others able to start moving forward with bending and walking normal.  I would love to walk normal again!!  
I need to do my other knee but need to get this first one to bend.  I almost feel like the MUA is the golden answer!
Any thoughts, I've been stuck for the past 5 weeks and working hard at home exercising and stretching.
Is the MUA the answer and what should I expect?
I would love to hear all input and honest opinions.
Thanks in advance.

"I’ve had arthritis developing in my knees over 20 years or so and I’m now on the waiting list for a left knee replacement in the UK.  My consultant tells me I could go for either a TKR or PKR as my osteoarthritis symptoms are on the cusp:  4th stage (bone on bone) in the medial compartment plus some (but much less) damage in the lateral compartment and at the patella.  The expectation is that I will need a TKR eventually but a PKR could delay this.  I’m tempted by the PKR as I have read that people can have better function and that it can feel still like a ‘normal’ knee.  I’m still (relatively!) young for this, at 54, and I want to be able to get back to activities like kayaking and therefore want to be able to squat, kneel etc.  However, as we know I do have osteoarthritis developing in the other compartments of my knee, I am also concerned that a PKR might not provide me with the relief I am hoping for and I might have to go through a TKR sooner rather than later.  Thoughts?

"Hello all,
?I posted a few weeks ago after seeing a consultant who advised that my knee was out of alignment and he was thinking about doing an osteotomy to realign. He sent me off for xrays then I had a telephone consultation last week. 
?He came back with ""it's as I thought - the xrays show bone on bone under the knee cap but the rest of the knee is ok. I will refer you to another surgeon for discussion for a knee cap replacement""
?Well this was all a bit of a surprise as he had been sure when I saw him and he examined me that alignment was causing the problems. 
?I have had ongoing problems since 2012 - multiple steroid injections - which did absolutely nothing (this first surgeon acknowledged that they probably wouldn't due to the type of problems - I also have pes anserinus - which feels like my knee is on fire) 2 microfractures - 1st a disaster and second minimal relief but now deteriorated.
?The surgeon said said they do 3000 knee replacements and 500 knee cap replacements at my local hospital each year. So I have Dr Googled knee cap replacements - apparently not common - I certainly fit the symptoms and reasons for the surgery as I read them. 
?I've had a bad weekend - the pain has been dreadful - and to  be honest I don't think I coped very well - especially as there is no end in sight.
?So has anyone had a kneecap replacement. When I had the second microfracture - the surgeon then did talk about this procedure.
?I just feel a bit pushed pillar to post at the moment. I haven't had the new appointment through yet. I hope it does come through......1st surgeon said 'leave it with me - I'll forward you on' so I hope he does. I could ring the secretary to check at some point if I don't hear anything soon. I'm in the UK

"I had a partial (patella femoral) replacement 4.5 weeks ago. Before hand I was told I would need 6 weeks off. However physio said this is very optimistic, more likely 8 weeks.
My bend is 90 degrees but extension still at -10. Pain is bearable but some days worse than others.
I am so incredibly tired though and still falling asleep in the day. The thought of being back at work in 10 days scares me (not started driving yet, told earliest for that is 6 weeks post op).
Interested to know when others went back to work and how was it?

"Hi 
I am 8 weeks Post Op and wondered how you were all getting on!!
I am pleased wit my progress other than having what is commonly know as a Bursea behind my Knee, this is causing me pain on bending but mainly through the night.
I am achieving a 140 bend, can walk properly up a full set of stairs going up, but still coming down with both feet on 1 step and need to work on this.
Physio have now reduced my visits to monthly and the consultant is really happy with the 'end' result, albeit i do have to go back in 6 weeks to check the Bursea. i have been told this may be drained or surgically removed if it doesnt go down on its own accord!! 
The on going issues i have is through the night i do have pain that keeps me awake and i rarely get a full nights sleep.
For all of you out there who have either just had the Operation or are due too i can only advise to be patient, the pain and disability gets better in my opinion after about 4 weeks, each day after this i found so much improvement, i am back driving, dont use any sticks at all now, and can walk quite a distance, i still have a slight limp when walking and am working hard on 'marching' when i walk advised by physio, apparently if i concentrate on swinging my arms when walking it makes me walk straight without a limp. I am still off work and dont imagine going back for a further 6 weeks. I use an static bike twice daily and try and beat my time each day, this is helping with my muscle wastage.
I could never imagine i would feel this way 4 weeks ago but now i am doing so well i know its been worth it. My scar looks good and is just a thin line although its a bit purple looking, i still have swelling on the knee but not much, and my Knee does look a funny shape!!
I hope you are all doing good and that my experiance helps you with your recovery.
Good luck and stay positive...

What I would like to suggest for this thread, as a bit of entertainment more than anything else, is for people to post ONE (just one!) hospital highlight and ONE (just one!) hospital horror.

"I know that I am going to need tkr on both knees soon.  I have had both of them scoped 5 or so years ago.  Knowing that was just a scope, and that was worse than ANY pain I have ever had, I am so very nervous, depressed, scared about this.  I have had a rash of medical issues since I hit 60 last year, and I feel as though all I did for 2017 was go to doctors appointments.  Meanwhile the knees have been neglected. I think subconsciously I have not done anything about them due to feeling so bad about the surgery.   I was reading some of the posts from others on here, and the idea this is going to take ONE YEAR recoup on each knee really makes me wonder if this is something I CAN do.  Between the sciatic pain I’m having and the knees both giving me fits, I have become a total hermit @ my house.  I work from home, which is nice for all my ailments these days, but I just don’t know if I can do this knowing the nightmare to come.  I had a friend who did this a few years back, and he used a machine that “worked” his knee while he was sitting in his recliner.  Is that something that is used commonly?  I also know when I had my knees scoped, I was given lortab for the pain, but it didn’t really help.  With all this opioid issue, is there something out there that actually works on the pain?  That is why I was so bad about doing my exercises because it HURT SO BAD !!!  I just need someone to tell me that it will be ok, and maybe it’s not as bad as I think it will be.  Also, knowing that I will need both worked on, how would you schedule the two operations?  How much time between the two?  I’m afraid that I will have one done, and then it’s so bad that I won’t ever do the other one.  I know I sound gloom and doom but that’s exactly how I feel right about now.

"I've knee cap pain for most of my life. I can't remember a time when I wasn't waking up in the middle of the night or having to cry myself to sleep in order to ignore my constant pain. The knee cap pain mostly occurs in the evenings occasionally starting in the middle of knight and lasting until I wake up or even when I wake up. Sometimes on one knee or the other. My mother, sister and I both have it however, and I do not know anyone else in my family. It is random bouts of pain at night that range from mild irritation or to full blown pain in my knee forcing me to become unable to walk or do any movement. I have been told it could be ""chrondromalacia patella"" but I do not have a flat foot and I don't work out much at all. I come from a line of people who have extremely poor stamina so it cannot be from any physical activity. The last time I did activity continuously, I had less occurrences of knee cap pain. I am currently a teenage girl between the ages of 13-17.

"11 days ago I fell badly onto my left knee and managed a 5 inch laceration to the bone just under my knee. Luckily my patella tendon was intact and I have no fractures. It was sutured in the ED and I was told to use crutches and not bend my knee at all while the stitches were in and to get them out in 10 day. I went to the hospital to get to taken out and they weren’t ready and was told to come back the following week for removal. 
Should I not attempt any kind of bending whilst the stitches are still in? I’ve been pretty much pain free for a week now and just been using the crutches to do longer distances than just round the house stuff. 
Any kind of advice or opinions on when I can start moving my knee again would be greatly appreciated, I didn’t see a doctor to ask at the hospital. I just don’t want to set myself back on healing at all

"For the brave of heart and mind, I offer this ""conjecture"" from a former, old world statistician...
If we look at recovery times as a normal bell curve distribution (not saying it is but humor me), then 95% of us fall within two standard deviations from the mean.  For argument's sake, let's say that those two standard deviations run from a 6-month recovery to a 12-month recovery with the mean at 9 months.  (Again...conjecture...these numbers could be more or less but probably not by much.)  That leaves the other 5% at 3 or more standard deviations from the mean (2.5% lower than 6 months / 2.5% higher than 12 months).  These are the ""outliers"".  Every distribution has some.
On the left side, are the 13-week mountain climbers while the 18-month recoveries are at the far right side.  All understandable...all part of a normal statistical bell curve distribution.  Think...smoking will eventually kill you.  Proven fact...but not for everyone.  I had a 103-year old great-uncle who smoked his little black cigars every day and never got lung cancer.  Outlier.  
The thing to remember is that this 5% are the exceptions and NOT THE RULE!  The rest of us mortals are stuck in the 95% umbrella and have to deal with real life.  I have pity for those at the far right end of the curve...they need to be brave souls...
At the beginning, I mentioned ""conjecture"".  In reality, I don't know of any study done on TKR recovery times and what the mean or standard deviation might be.  I'm just throwing this out there because so many people compare themselves to those rare individuals who beat this in a matter of weeks.  DON'T DO THAT!!!  They are the outliers, the weird individuals who have the built-in DNA to overcome this brutal recovery in seemingly no time at all.
You have seen sooo many of us counsel people not to compare your recovery to that of anyone else.  Take that to heart...and know one huge truth...
You will not know where you fell within the bell curve UNTIL YOUR RECOVERY IS OVER!!!  You can't see it while you're going through it...only from the outside (post-recovery) looking back in.
Be Zen: ""It will be over when it's over.""   Just like asking your dad on a car ride when you were a kid: ""When will we get there?""  Remember his answer?  ""WHEN WE GET THERE!""

"Hi everyone, I'm 16 and have been having issues with both of my knee caps dislocating fairly easily for many years. It started about 5 years ago, mainly because I had lazy gamer legs at the time. About three years ago, I broke my wrist thanks to my weak legs and ended up doing therapy to strengthen them up a bit. Of course, I eventually got lazy again.
Fast forward to about a year ago, I got into road cycling and mountain biking and will soon be doing it competitively. I do 40-60 minutes of intense training five to six days a week. Because of this, I figured I was done with dislocations. But alas, my right knee dislocated after I jumped over a small mound of snow last month; A simple action which shouldn't cause anyones knee to blow out. Aside from that painful event, I've noticed that my knees still ""almost"" pop out just by lightly bumping them, or by bending my leg in perfectly normal ways. 
At this point, I'm not sure what else I could possibly do to stop my knees from dislocating. The only thing I can think of is that the tendons in my legs are tight? Stretching is one thing that I never do.  In fact, my hamstrings are so tight that I can barely bend over when I prop a leg up. This is very frustrating for me because I have developed somewhat of a phobia of doing anything that might cause a dislocation, and it's keeping me from doing the fun things I'd like to do. Any advice on this will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you!

I had a virus which made me bedridden for just over a week - could that be relevant? Also have an under-active thyroid and put on more weight which is an on going battle.  Again could this be a factor?
Thanks in anticipation

"Went to hospital to see my surgeon for my Last Check up for my Hip replacement that I had 4 months ago. I have been told that I need a Knee Replacement as I have severely worn knee, very swollen and a bakers cyst on the back of knee which is painful. BUT I was informed that I will have to wait at least a year to have surgery on my knee in case of getting an infection that would pass to the hip!!! I was told that if my hip went well I would have the knee replaced.... never at any time was I told that I would have to wait a year!!! Has anyone one else had this happen?  I asked if I could have Ostinil Plus Injection or Cortisone, just to get me through until I can have surgery. I was told that that was not possible as it was too soon after surgery!!! I live in Uk and my surgery was done on the NHS.... would really appreciate it if anyone has been told this thanks! I must add that he looked at my knee scan and xray and said that my knee is very bad!

"Hi everyone. Quick background info - had TKR end of September, age 47, it went ok but have never achieved much bend. At 6 weeks via tele-conference surgeon wasn't worried because of my age, the surgeries I had had in the past, and the bad condidtion of my knee going into surgery. Said that it would just take me a little longer. But I got nowhere at all. It was blocked. Like there was physically something there - of course there was - scar tissue.
Waiting to read surgical report - but what is known is that he couldn't just do manipulation - he had to scope and clean out scar tissue. Before procedure he was angry with me and said I should have been one of the successes and that nobody can bend my knee but me. I told him I had done everything and much more to try to achieve ROM (I can straighten it though) and that my PT's could not figure out why I was making absolutely no progress and was stuck at 75 degrees. He said I wouldn't be there had I been doing everything that I should have been doing. He didn't believe me. 
Anyway - procedure went well - and I went to physio all week last week. Started at 90 degrees and by the end of the week had achieved 100 degrees. I was so excited and determined and continued to do exercises all weekend. I even helped clean the (horse) barn.
Saturday afternoon I started noticing the familiar tightness happening around my knee cap..........and that I wasn't able to bend it as far when doing exercises or bending my leg while seated.........and by Monday I knew for sure. I was losing bend! Today, in physio - I was devastated to realize that I was absolutely not achieving what I had last week - and I measured 88 degrees today. 
I am so upset! This has been such a long haul and I do not understand what is going on with my knee. I am wondering if:  a) it could be mechanical - too big, or too tight? Possibly spacer too large........and if so - could surgeon bend when I was under anesthesia? OR
b) Can I be doing too much and didn't allow for healing after procedure - especially since they had to go in and scope it? Maybe it's swelling too much - from being up on it a lot - maybe it's swollen in joint and affecting bend.........?

"hi I'm now 7 months post op TKR.  I have limited knee bend despite doing my exercises and Physio.  I can live with that but I am still on strong painkillers and am getting a bit paranoid about getting addicted.  I am only able to walk short distances.  Nights are still horribly painful and there seems to be a huge time difference in the recovery times.  I am considering trying acupuncture to try and relieve the pain.  Has anyone else tried alternative therapies?  I find the whole thing depressing and find myself getting weepy frequently. For this reason I haven't discussed this with my GP.  Thanks

"I had Tkr 2 and half weeks ago on my left knee. I have learned from this experience that you are fighting against the time. The moment that you had your knee surgery. Your body started to grow the scar tissue around the injured area. If you want to have less pain. First you must reduce the swelling. I ice my knee every day for the first two weeks before and after exercise and I also elevator with pillows at night. If you have too much swelling. It's quite difficult to do the daily exercise. Also the more pain you have at night. The more exercise that you needs to do in the day time because the ligament is trying to find it's own place and usually at night it pull the opposite ways. Now I am able to turn side to side with minimum pain. I know it's challenge at times. Believe me the sooner that you do your exercise the sooner that you will be getting better. I hope my insight can give you a little bit if encouragment. Keep up the good work

"After a hip and knee replacement on the right, and subsequently finding I had a quite bad scoliosis made much worse by unequal leg length, I am in such pain. My back has been very painful for a long time, way before the hip replacement 10 years ago. I am on Tramadol, Naproxen and Amitriptilyne much to no effect now. I was prescribed Gabapentin 3 months ago, but stopped taking them 3 weeks back as no improvement noticed. I did titrate down but only for 2 weeks. The pain is much much worse. I noticed also around Xmas that the other hip was starting to hurt similar to the replaced one plus that pain seems to be going down to the knee. So what with the back, the hip the knee and a long standing bursitis in the unoperated thigh I am at my wits end. Any thought folks? A bullet might work!! I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow.

"Checking in to give encouragement! Yesterday i walked for 6.5 miles-nonstop. Did over 8 all totalled by end of day and i can still move today! My left knee still gets a little grumbly (i had to have an arthroscopy 4mo after for a bone spur doc missed in surgery) but the pain doesnt ever get worse with exercise-just achey. The last few months i have been pushing on stamina and endurance. My very first time on the treadmill post op, .5mph almost killed me, and now 3mph is good.
I am happy i am doing well. I preached STRETCHING every day and feel this is the core reason i did well. Im young and hope i never need another surgery.
This site got me thru the pain,misery,agony and depression that no one else warns you about. The journey is personal for each of us. We all heal different and have different pain tolerances. I dealt with a lot of scar tissue (that ""band"" that everyone talks about ) . Glad i broke it up in the beginning, because my range is great now. Ive not forgotten the horrific pain i endured but it doesnt cause the same ptsd""now what"" that it did at 8months. Every day would bring its own problems and every morning brought new hope.
Stay strong KNEEBIES! Push on, be diligent and purposeful. I admit im not 100% yet in strength (backpacking awaits me) but at least i can day hike now with a small backpack!
15 months later, moving forward and so very glad (as the song says)when i was going thru hell-i kept on going!
God Bless all of you!

"Hi, my 14 yo niece has had some knee problems for the past year or 2 and recently, she got much worse to the point she can barely walk, and has terrible pain in her knees.
She's doing physiotherapy, but it doesn't seem to be helping at all, seems to be actually making her worse. One of then doctors that saw her changed the kind of physiotherapy she was doing, but still doesn't work.
We're at a loss, unable to understand why a 14 year old is now unable to walk, and the doctors seeing her seem to not have any answers either.
I'm wondering if anyone here has any advice of what it might be, or what to discuss with the doctor next time she goes there. Maybe asking the right questions will allow them to give some answers, or spark some idea in the doctor for something else to try.
Can it be bad nutrition? She did blood tests and everything doctors asked to check was normal, but is there any test that is uncommon or expensive so doctors tend not to ask for it at first? She was a picky eater as a child, not so much as a child.
She used to be tiny as a child and when she reached puberty, she grew up a lot, to then point she's one of the tallest people in the family. Can it be that? She grew up so fast that her body couldn't adapt? If so, what can be done to correct it and reduce her pain and inability to walk?
Some people in my family are afraid it's some degenerative disease, but honestly I think that's a stretch. Wouldn't it affect other parts of her body besides the knees if it was that?
Should she continue physiotherapy, if it causes her so much pain? I'm guessing stopping making exercise is worse in long term, but is there anything else to make her more comfortable?
Should we take her to a private doctor for a while, to get a second opinion and maybe get things moving a bit faster than in public? We're in Portugal, and although doctors in public sector can be really good, the system is slow. Private would be expensive, by if it makes her better, could be worth it.
Sorry for all the ramble, just don't know what to do anymore.
Any help / advice would be most welcome.
Thanks

"I had a TKR on my right knee just before Christmas - so I'm now eight weeks post op.
I used to browse these sites before the operation and most of the posts I found were negative and led me to wonder whether I was making the right decision.  So I thought I should post something myself to let others know that it's not always doom and gloom and perhaps I can put some minds at rest.
Yes the first few weeks were painful, I had a lot of bruising and didn't get much sleep; but since then my recovery has gone very well.  I stopped using crutches at the end of week three and have now ceased all pain meds.  My range of movement on the operated leg is almost as good as the other one and pain is minimal.
I've worked hard at it though - exercises four times a day and an hour at a knee replacement exercise group run by physiotherapists once a week.  I ice and elevate regularly and rest as much as possible - it's important to get a balance between work and rest as both are important.  I shall continue to do this for many months yet as healing takes up to a year.
I still have that tight band feeling around my knee but I try to ignore it and I'm sure it will go away eventually; it doesn't stop me from doing anything and I'm now back to around 10000 steps on my Fitbit most days and intend to start back to Pilates classes next week.
So if you're about to have this operation think positive.  The stats show that there are far more successes than failures and there's every chance you'll be one of the lucky ones, even if it takes a bit longer.
Wishing everyone out there all the best.

"Hi folks,  I will be 9 weeks po tomorrow &  just had my 2nd physio session yesterday.
All good, flexion 120+, but that was with physio pushing the leg back & with little discomfort! However under muscle power alone I get barely 100 & extension just off 0. So not much to do on the straightening but now need strength for full rom!
She has now dropped the heel slides from my routine (yay!!) but has given me others to help strengthen! (Shhh, don't tell her, but I prefer the new exercises!) including an exercise on the bottom step of the stairs very similar to how Chico says to climb the stairs!
This is such a different recovery from last year, more pain early on (probably because I refused morphine iv in hospital) but much more movement which I also put down to no morphine. I was so out of it that I could hardly stay awake, that was when I wasn't vomiting up everything I ate or drank! I spent most of my time lying on the bed asleep & had half hearted physio sessions! 
I found it difficult to 'own' the new knee last year & was fearful of pushing it, but this one no probs!
Just thought I would share that with you. At least you will understand.
If this is your 1st TKR don't be afraid to push it as long as you are not in too much pain! Don't get to screaming point when exercising but don't think you'll damage the new joint. Let pain & the knee guide you.
The best advice I can give anyone is don't be a martyr, ask for help when you need it. Look after yourself, take plenty of rest & when you need to cry do! You've had brutal surgery, give yourself, your body & your mind good time to recover.
We will all get there eventually

"After two accidents which resulted in two micro fracture ops in 2009 and 2013 stem cell treatment and two years Physio weekly with knee off loaded for two years; my leg was bent out from the knee down to the right by over 12 degrees. I had TKR and Osteotomy on 9.1.18. 
I had spinal so pain first day not too bad. That night hit me like thunder clap but think this was Osteotomy and straightening of leg not TKR.  Day 1 walked around bed with Zimmer frame and sat out for short while. Had catheter so felt hindered with that. Did lots of deep breathing and drank lots and lots of wTer to flush my system. 
Day 2 was on crutches; catheter removed in afternoon; drain removed at night. Had shower late afternoon.  Felt very tearful which really is not like me. I’m an active 60 yr old divorced Mum of 4 grown up children, 3 live with me with 17month old Grandson; 2 dogs and a cat.
Day 3 walked with crutches around the room up and down to bathroom felt drowsy I think with pain killers. Walked up and down wArd and did stairs. 
Day 4 - tired today but doing exercises and icing is really helping, knee is black and blue. Swelling is bad in my ankle and that really hurts. Don’t know why. Bend is 90 straightening -50. 
Day 5 home - wheel chair to car. Got in no problem as bend is good.  Good to be home but very tired. 
Day 6 - icing taking pain killers and elevating a lot. Doing exercises. Using good leg to lift operated leg on and off bed by hooking foot under. Heel shuffles to bend knee and trying to straighten. I’m finding that harder than bending. 
Day 7 - 1 week post op went out for cream tea; walked too far in bad rain on crutches but it was so worth it. 
Day 8 - Physio today was surprised as still have staples in. 
Days 9, 10 and 12 rest; exercises, pain relief and ice. Can’t believe I’m 2 weeks nearly post op. Staples out tomorrow - a little nervous as being told horror stories. 
Was given the best advise - pain killers half hour before staples due out and ice. Not any where near as bad as I thought; few ouch moments but that is it. I have electric reclining chairs; really think they help with bend. Couple of days with wound leaking a little, nurse had put steri strips on so it soon heeled up. 
Shower at home today - lovely as been having strip washes. Physio again. Deep tissue massage; thought he was being nice showing me how to massage scar. How wrong was I lol. Next day felt easier. Still using ice 5 to 6 times a day. Zapain and Ipbuprofen 4 hourly Zoplicone for sleep and sorely morph at night. Only used 10 mild 3 times though on 3 separate nights; mainly when doing a bit too much (dishwasher, putting washing on; ) tut tut. 
Week 3 - Physio bend 110 straighten -35 getting there. Physio pleased. 
Week 4 back at work (office based) 3 hrs a day for 3 days. Tired but happy. 
Week 5 today; started on 5 hrs a day yesterday for all of this week; down to one crutch when required or none. Did much too much today. Didn’t use crutches; up and down stairs 4 times; no ice and I’m suffering - had to take oral morph tonight - 1st time in 3 weeks I think. Do cross with myself. Work rest and siesta after work the rest of this week I think.

"My first TKR went textbook style. 3 months and I was back in the saddle working and just getting used to the new feel of my knee.
I am now 4 months out of the right knee replacement and I am having issues with my muscles. We I bend my right knee you can see a muscle do a ""flip"" for lack of other words. My PT has never seen anything like this and it just keeps doing it. We even to a video of it to show my surgeon. He was quite surprised, to say the least. But offered no explanation other than to give me another 3 months off work to see if it would help. 
Like most of you, I have experienced the pain that runs from mid-thigh to your knee and then I have pain that runs from the next muscle below my knee to my ankle. The pain is awful and we have tried 30 sessions of PT and also used KT tape to try and get this over with, but no luck. 
My drive to work is 1.5 hours and I cannot drive that far during a morning commute and live with the pain it is causing. 
We are now going to try ""dry needle"" therapy. I have never done this and it just sounds terrible, even though I know it is all in my head. 
Have any of you experienced any of these issues I am facing???

"PT’s only noticed last week that my quad quivers - very weak.  For comparison, the left leg quad is perfect and very strong. So, the pressing the knee down in flat leg position doesn’t do much.
They explained to me that the quadricep muscle is hugely important in centering and balancing/supporting all the components of the knee.
Anyone experience similar problem and how do you cope with it?
Are there exercises to strengthen the TKR weakened quad?

"Had PKR 13 days ago.
Was feeling like I was making huge progress. I hardly had any pain yesterday and was able to exercise and bend well. However today it has been very painful. Not great on day of physio!
Was really hoping to be able to go down to one crutch, but said not yet. She was pleased but a long way to go. I was annoyed that I was only at 88 degrees bend as I had achieved that whilst I was in hospital so I thought it would be better than that now. Been doing all my exercises every day, so I thought I would have made better progress. I asked her about recovery time being quicker for a partial. (Everyone keeps saying it's only a partial) She said with the patella femoral I had, the recovery and pain is exactly the same as a total. Only difference is total causes slightly more swelling. I was hoping to get back to work at 4 weeks, but she said no. Earliest 6 weeks and then possibly a phased return of only 2 hours a day to begin with. So a bit disappointed with that.
It's very swollen and painful now. When she pushed on the knee while straightening into the bed, I nearly hit the ceiling with the pain.
I didn't have any painkillers yesterday apart from at bedtime, but certainly had plenty today!
Oh well, no pain, no gain! X

"Hi all I am 8 months post op TKR have been very lucky in my recovery progress. Am pain free and have full range of motion.  I do have stiffness from the back of my knee when moving after sitting for a while but recently it seems to be getting worse  even affecting my range of movement. Am thinking it could be scar tissue? I’ve booked in with a sports masseuse for a consultation, could this help? Thanks

"Hello I am a massage therapist with 22 years experience from Canada but now living in Roatan, Honduras, an island in the Caribbean.  I have a client who had a full knee replacement (Titanium) of his right knee at a reputable clinic in the Cayman Islands.  The orthopedic surgeon said after the surgery that after over 600 knee replacement surgeries, his was the second worst he had seen up to that time.  Its important to note that he played football and had had a somewhat botched surgery on his knee over 40 years prior.  The surgeon noted small amounts of calcium build up in and around the knee joint and did his best to scrape most of it out.  Since the operation this client has been getting three sessions a week of massage with me and 3 sessions a week of physio therapy treatments with a certified physiotherapist from Austria that now lives on the island.  After initially finding that there was progressive improvement he seems to have hit a plateau and on some days it seems like he is loosing those gains.  He still can't bend his knee to 90 degrees and has a lot of nerve type pain.  The Surgeon is coming to the island next week to review the case however I and the physio will most likely not be able to meet with the surgeon.  He is bringing some medicine that can't be found on the island to deal with the nerve pain that he is experiencing on the inside of his right knee.  To add a little more detail this client is clinically obese and efforts to get him to lose weight have not been successful.  All that being said he is much more mobile in comparison to before the surgery however his good knee has been taxed and is also hurting him.  I dedicate some time to his ""good"" knee to balance things out.  I've also continued using ice up to this point.  I'm looking for suggestions, insights, links for sites with information, videos, anything that can help me get my client to progress past this plateau.  Thank you all in advance.

"im 5weeks post TKR and I am only bending to 40 degrees. My PT is suggesting to my surgeon I have a MUA, which I am terrified about. In the meantime I will be having hydrotherapy to strengthen the muscles. I have a few questions, how long does a MUA take, are you under for long? Does it set your recovery back? Is it painful? Do you stay in hospital over night? So sorry for all the questions I'm terrified, I'm 47 and really thought the recovery would be a little easier than this, it's certainly a roller coaster of a journey.

I walk a lot now and I am trying to do other exercises too. Physical therapy stopped last month and I really don't want to go back if it can be avoided. I sincerely felt there is nothing they were doing for me that I can't continue on my own. I feel more relaxed as well not having the anxiety of measuring bend as they were super keen on that even over being straight which is better but still needs a little improvement. Any experiences you've had might be helpful.

"Hello to the people who kept me sane last time
I had my 2nd TKR in 9months ( different knees). I have had totally different experiences yet same surgeons etc. I am two weeks out and ok so far. Pain bad and struggling to control as on max dose of codine and paracetamol, I am using voltarol gel and ice too. I don’t want anything else as feel so sick when I change meds. 
My  question is about the scar. My stitches came out on Friday and she asked me to keep it covered for 24 hours as she had to pull scabs to get stitches out. She felt they should have been removed at 10 days. Anyway now I am just letting water run over  the  scar in the shower and scabs have formed again. I am letting it dry naturally  and not yet touching it. It does feel odd like last time with cloth over it but allowing this. 
I cant remover if I wait for scabs to fall off before I massage the incision. I struggled last time but my other scar is fine. I used bio oil. 
Any suggestions as I got an infection last time and feel it was because I used oil on incision too soon.

The pain got woarse for about 48 hours then eased off. I would delay running for a week or two, & then try again, but each time the pain & problem came back. I have had an MRI scan of my knee & it was diagnosed as having a complex significant tear to the medial meniscus. I am not really an ambitious runner, but do miss not being able to run at least 4 times a week. I have ran 10 marathons, but would like to continue running regularly. I am not sure what surgery can be done to correct tears to the medial meniscus, & whether they are risky or easy to do.

"I am 6 months post-op TKR right knee. Between insurance politics/delays & the hurricane hitting 2 weeks post op, my recovery was delayed slightly as I only got a couple of PT sessions within the first 3 weeks. Unfortunately, 6 weeks post-op I fell in a parking lot and my knee reopened nearly top to bottom, resulting in emergency surgery and almost a week long hospitalization. I was lucky (so they say) in that my hardware was not damaged, but it essentially started the recovery process over as my leg was immobilized for nearly 2 weeks due to the risk of the incision reopening yet again. I was released from PT before Christmas and only made it that long after repeated appeals to insurance. My release notes stated that I was ""functional"" and therefore no longer needed therapy, even though I could still not walk more than 20 yds or so without my knee giving way due to instability (still a fall risk), and my balance as a whole was poor (additionally, my quad was only partially engaging still due to the long term damage that had weakened it to the point it quit working). Since ending PT, I have joined a gym and visit 3-4 times a week, doing many of the same exercises I was doing in PT to try to build strength and balance around the knee, and riding the stationary bike a lot. I am still having lots of daily pain, some of which is excruciating, the tightness builds quickly, and nerve pain around my incision is starting to increase again (I ceased all pain meds with the help of my pain mgmt doctor in December). I have a great deal of discomfort around my kneecap especially, as well as the inner left side of my knee where the drain tubes were in following my emergency surgery. My incision also dries out to the point the skin feels like it is cracking, and I can't seem to use enough Vit E cream. Dr told me 6 months to a year due to the setback from my fall, but I did not expect the pain to still be this bad at this point, and I cannot bend it nearly as much as I was able to do in PT (I made it to 125 degrees in therapy; I would bet I am about 110-115 now). I hate to complain, but it is affecting my quality of life and not sure if my expectations are too high or not.  I keep hearing my case is unique...I wish I had someone to relate to.  The pain is affecting me in so many ways, and I miss being happy. Pre-surgery, my knee hurt, but nothing like this.

Both said I would have to have TKR again. I truly don't want another surgery. At this point though, I really don't have much choice because I can't live like this.

"Hi I had a partial knee replacement last June 2017 on my right knee and this put too much strain on my left knee. It is now sticking and locking as well as giving way and causes me a great deal of pain even at rest but especially walking.
?I have had x-rays and as it isn't bone on bone just reduced cartilage the surgeon is reluctant to do a knee replacement at this time. The x-rays have shown that I am bow legged and he has recommended an unloader knee brace to shift the weight from my inner (medial) knee to the outside.
These are expensive £600 and I need to know of anyone's experiences.
?Do they hurt? They look very cumbersome. Do they actually work or am I wasting my time and money just putting off the inevitable knee replacement?
?I have tried many off the shelf knee supports but they actually hurt when holding the knee almost like a toothache being poked!
?Also I am very chubby above the knee and much slimmer below so find the supports just roll down.
?I know these expensive ones are made to measure so would hope they fit but I find it hard to believe they will stop the Osteoarthritis from hurting.
Sorry for the ramble just looking for some guidance. Thank you

"Hi Everyone.Im back looking for a bit of advice please.
I am now at 15weeks post tkr.Apart from the usual problems with pain,nerve pain,tightness and bit of infection in part of the scar I seemed to be doing really well.I had my op on 26 Oct and I saw my surgeon and pt at beginning of December.They were both pleased with my extension and my knee bend which was 95deg.When I saw my pt ten days later the bend was at 110.Four weeks ago it was 120deg.so she said she didn't need to see me again as I was doing so well.I was able to get upstairs normally from week 7(with a bit of pain)and coming down a few weeks ago.I still had a fair bit of swelling above the knee on the left and under the knee on the inside.3 weeks ago I started getting pain going upstairs again and I'm having to hold on again.I have a lot of discomfort all around my knee.I started driving again but it's a small town so not much.I just noticed some of the hardness on the left side of my knee seems to be softening a bit and it's a bit more sensitive to touch again.
Im sorry this is such a long story but I wonder if anyone has any ideas.Thankyou and good luck to everyone.By the way I am 67

"Here I am again. Thank God for my wonderful husband.
He deserves husband of the year. I would not have survived this if it wasn't for him.
Now I am going to get to my discussion.
I am almost 9 weeks since TKR. The surgery went great.
The surgeon was very pleased. I didn't have any extra weight, actually umder weight. He didn't have to cut
away fat or excess skin.
My knee Has never swollen. I can't walk much and have to use my walker because of my other knee. I have replacement surgery April 20th if I can make it that long.
After the first surgery I said never again. Now I am begging to have it done.
I am trying to have the next surgery ASAP.
The first surgery was the most painful surgery I have ever had. It was worth it. With all the pain, I would have the surgery again in a heartbeat.
If you are afraid of having the surgery, make sure you have a fantastic surgeon. That helps immensely. If you need knee replacement, don't walk, run to have it done. It has given me a new lease on life.

" Hello Everyone! 
I am 5 1/2 months on my tkr. I pretty much got my life back and that feels good.
?Like most people I still have my stiffness in mornings and sitting for a while. Also still get little swelling in right knee when I am on it for little while can go up and down stairs fairly easy.
I am curious on something? Has anyone been able to cross their legs? (Meaning in sitting down can anyone cross their operated leg to the other thigh) I can only get my foot to the other knee cap.
?I also want too encourage others in don't expect your recovery to be like others who had tkrs done. For example: I met a guy at the store about a week ago and he had his tkr done with in a week of mine. He was still using his walker to get around and can barely walk without it.
And I am in better shape in my recovery.
?My sister in law had both her knees done the last one about a month before mine.and she has no stiffness or pain. she latterly has her life back with no complications. wish i was that way sometimes.

"I am 6 weeks post-op--I hit 110 degrees with heel slides and am at - 2 with extensions.  I am able to go full around with pedaling on a recumbent bike. Been off the walker since week 3 and walking without cane in the house--use it outside if snowing etc. Been doing cooking again and laundry of course --husband still helps with housework. Knee still feels heavy and stiff and is painful and aches randomly-even while sleeping.  I am able to keep my legs on the floor for quite a long time--2 hours for sure--but feels way better when I elevate it.  I would say I felt a big improvement almost overnight in the 5th week.
I know my PT will expect me to improve over 110 flexion tomorrow since Tuesday I was 110--trying to figure out what I can do to help me get there--I do knee squats while holding onto the walker--do straight leg raises and do heel slides while sitting in chair while moving closer and closer to the edge of the chair until it hurts and then past that as much as I can. I am not able to walk down a few steps one leg after the other yet!! I still go 1 step at a time--that is a goal I definitely have to reach--how is anyone out there doing with that and any hints to what might  help with steps?  I am massaging my knee with oil and loton a lot and using ice although not through the night--I still elevate it most of the time while watching TV.  One last thing--I am having low back pain and a bit of sciatica--mostly its just like a toothache and massaging it seems to help.

"Hi all 
Can anyone offer some advice? I had a TKR 5.5 weeks ago things are going really well. I’m planning on returning to work in three weeks and want to reduce my pain relief. 
Following my op I was put on zomorph 2x 10mg capsules morning and night and 4 hourly paracetamol and ibruprofen.  The zomorph was due to the severe pain following 4 previous knee ops and complications during surgery. 
I went to the docs requesting to be weaned off the strong pain relief, he suggested codine 30mg 4 hourly with paracetamol. I spent a day on this and the pain went through the roof..... I feel shocking and my knee is so stiff it’s unbelievable.  I was doing so very well and really don’t want to struggle in this level of pain but understand there will be withdrawals. Is this typical or not? Should I do a week of 1 10mg zomorph then switch to codine?? Your comments welcome.

"Hi All, 
I want to end on a positive note as I’m leaving this forum. I am six weeks post op from a left total knee replacement and patella tomorrow. All I can say is that my own personal experience has been a positive one and I want to give the other side of the story to those pre op. 
The first two weeks were tough, week three is when it turned around. I started driving again, went to the supermarket and went back to work part time. I reduced my pain meds, got rid of the crutches and started getting my life back. Pre op I made sure I was as fit as possible for the surgery, I did my prehab and I am sure that helped speed up my recovery. Getting back to normal as soon as possible also helped - when you are living your life you have less time to focus on your knee, you just get on with it. 
I have one more physio on Wednesday and I am seeing my surgeon on Saturday to schedule the right tkr. I can only recommend anyone who needs this operation to fully commit to it and just go for it. I was determined that I would have a quick, positive recovery and that is what I have had. 
I wish everyone on here all this best for their recovery and hope anyone pre op can take something from this. I was inspired by a lady who told me is her great recovery and if one person gets the same from this post then my work is done.

"Hello,
?Just some background as it seems to be a long story. After months of left knee pain went to GP who referred me on. Had steroid injections which did nothing.
Had arthroscopy/microfracture in Dec 2013 which was a disaster, more pain than ever before and off work for 4 months (couldn't bend or kneel which is vital for my work). Had right knee done in 2014 which was a success. Interestingly the physio I saw after the left knee said he felt the knee was out of alignment (more of this in a bit).
Back for another arthroscopy/microfracture in April 2015 which did make a bit of a difference. Surgeon said the previous microfracture didn't work. Got on with it and ignored the constant pain.
?Gradual deterioration and back to GP for more referral 2016/17 Through another round of steroid injections & hyaluronic acid injections. The first doctor I saw in 2017 - not a knee specialist - this is the Virgin Care musculoskeletal clinic; said I would need a partial knee replacement, sent me for mri then phoned (no appointments just telephone consultation) to say I had severe inflammation of the pes anserinus and a steroid jab would cure it along with physio - there was nothing wrong with my knee as such.
?Well this didn't work - not a jot. Physio gave me exercises, which I did, ultrasound treatment and strapping. I seem to have multiple points of pain, the knee cap itself constantly aches - all the time. This is a dull grinding ache. Then I have the sharp pain at the point of inflammation - very painful. The pain keeps me awake at night and does impact on my life. I cannot sit with my leg at right angles without pain at all. Strangely my mobility is very good - I can flex and bend and straighten it. I am consistent in doing my strengthening exercises and stretching too. 
?So back to Dr who referred me on to the consultant sports knee specialist for some ultrasound shock treatment which first Dr assured me would cure the problem. 
?Saw this man who looked at my knee and said I had multiple problems, the main one being my knee is out of alignment and wearing the medial (?) inside bit of my knee. Which in turn is causing the inflammation problems. He talked about doing an osteotomy to realign my leg/knee.
?He said my situation was not clear cut in that he wouldn't say yes he would do it. He said the inflammation problems will not go all the time my knee is wonky. He has sent me for a set of xrays and another mri which is this week and I have another telephone appt at the end of February.
?The pain is constant and does affect my life. I have a physical job in that I have to be able to get up and down off the floor multiple times a day (I work with disabled pre-schoolers). I like my job and would like to continue to do it. I'm 54 - nearly 55. I have been advised to lose weight. I  have lost over 10lbs in 3 weeks. I know this must be beneficial and know this is a good thing to do, so am determined to do so. I know it must have made a difference but the pain has not eased at all. (I don't know what I expected really!) But I will lose it.
?So, after all that, my question is; does anybody have any experience of this? I can understand the reservations of doing a partial knee replacement at my age - once there's no joint you can't go back the other way. However cutting a bit of bone out of my leg and plating it also seems very drastic. But it does give me the option of a replacement later if necessary. Consultant did say that there are not many options for arthritic knees apart from replacement. 
?I've had a bad weekend pain wise so feeling  a bit down and lost. I would just like the pain to stop for once. 
?What ever I have done I am committed to aiding recovery, I am very good at following through on physio etc. I also get very good sick pay from work which is something to consider. I would rather have something done now while I am young enough to be able to recover well. How much should I push for something to be done?
Has anybody had an osteotomy vs knee replacement?
?Thank you and thank you for getting to the end of this very long ramble!

"I'm in the UK and had my TKR through the NHS nine weeks ago. Two weeks after surgery I had pins and needles in my calf and shin which developed into a painful burning sensation with sharp electrical shocks in the foot and ankle. This condition started 7 weeks ago and my PT told me it would disappear on its own, my doctor prescribed a painkiller which I've learnt is useless for nerve pain. Last week I saw my surgeon and explained my symptoms, I am now waiting to have an MRI scan which to me points to problems caused by the spinal block I had immediately before surgery. These last few days I feel  there has been a slight improvement but it could be I'm getting used to the pain. I'm worried the MRI results will show inoperable and permanent damage, I've not read a post on here from anyone who has suffered nerve damage but if you have had a similar experience what was your prognosis, and was it cured by surgery or other means.

"Hello all,
I have a knee problem. At first I ran into the dog, and I didn't realize my knee was that messed up, but a few days later I couldn't even walk. The picture of my knee where I drew on it was where the pain was. I think it was from running into the dog, but I'm not certain because it wasn't immediately a huge problem. 
Then a couple weeks later, my knee was finally getting good enough to walk on somewhat, and a horse kicked me. You can see the horse hoof print on the outside of my leg. 
That too seemed to take a while for the pain to be fully realized. Now it has been a few months, and my knee lets me walk on it sometimes without pain, while other times it's  extremely painful. Moreover, it seems like the location of the pain moves around.  Sometimes it's the inside of my  leg where I drew a circle,  sometimes it's a bone on inner side the knee, and sometimes it's the back of my knee, with cramping.
What do you guys think is wrong with it? I went to the doctor and he bent it around doing tests, but didn't find anything notable. Yet something is clearly wrong. I'm not a wimp, and I'm in a lot of pain sometimes. Further, the leg just doesn't seem to work right. My foot doesn't pick up the same, my leg doesn't swing forward the same, etc... sometimes worse than other times.
I wanted to start doing some leg exercises, like squats, to improve it, but it's simply too painful currently.

Most days I just use a cane but at times still use my walker. I feel like I should be doing better. Has anyone else had a problem walking?

"I am 8 days post op for a TKR, I spent 5 days in hospital , they got me up on the 3rd day just to walk to the door with a frame then put me back to bed. When it came to my discharge my physiotherapist would not discharge me until I could bend my leg to 90 degrees, I went from 0-70 degrees with the most un bearable pain, she let me out with a strict warning if I cannot reach 90 degrees I will have to go back in and have a anesthetic and have my knee manipulated then go on a machine than bends it! This absolutely terrified me and I've been excerising religiously to try and get this bend to 90 degrees, which I still cannot do. Im using ice and my pain meds, I'm walking ok with crutches, I can straighten it fine, still un able to lift it . Today I'm feeling really down and tearful as its another day I can not bend it further, will it be easier when the staples are out? I'm so scared of having the manipulation . The pain is horrendous though the swelling is getting better, sleep? What sleep . I'm 47 and really should be doing more apparently so my therapist says. Any advice would be a great help to me right now please.

"Almost 6 months since my first TKR. Plan was to return for the other knee 3 months ago/3 months after the first. However.....
Five weeks after the TKR I underwent an MUA (more painful than the op itself) as the knee wouldnt bend much beyond 70 degrees and the extension was around -10 to -15 degrees.
The surgeon managed to bend the knee to 100 degrees and hes a big bloke. I then rented a CPM machine for home and twice a day for 4 weeks, strapped myself in and (always starting at around 70 degrees) increased the bend to the mid 90's, over the next couple of hours.
The surgeon had mentioned the day after the TKR that he was in two minds as to whether to fit a 9mm or 10mm plastic, so went with the 10mm, 'so it didnt rattle around'..
The surgeon was/is therefore adamant that the lack of bend is due to the 1mm too thick plastic and gave me the following options : 1) Another MUA  2) Open the knee back up and change the plastic to a 9mm.
Neither option excites me, so he suggested I see a colleague of his for a second opinion. Another 5 weeks passed and I finally met with his colleague, who (given the info above) I was fully expecting to concur with surgeon one.. Much to my surprise however, he suggested I leave it alone and 'see how it goes'.
I now have two professionals who are diametrically opposed as to my next move and I am supposed to make a decision about my knee's future based on this !
I immediately went to see my surgeon who when asked how they can have such a different view, responded with 'Im a surgeon and if I see something not right, I fix it surgically'...   Not exactly helpful..
I decided to take the second opinions suggestion as it sounded less painful !
I have since tried hydrotherapy and another physiotherapist. My latest physio moved my leg around and is adamant that the plastic isnt too thick, as my knee does indeed rattle. Very irritating when driving, as I have to keep my left leg wedged against the footrest (I drive an auto) so it doesnt rattle.
The most useful info I have had so far was from a chance meeting when I took my dog to the vet a couple of weeks ago. Two ladies were talking knees, so I rudely interrupted !
One of the ladies had been in my position 6 months in, of still being uncomfortable most of the time, very itchy inside, especially at the back of the knee, unable to walk unaided due to the lack of extension and generally wondering why she bothered doing it in the first place.
She did however then tell me that she pretty much left the leg alone and now at 14 months post-tkr is able to touch her heel to her backside.
Im due to meet with my surgeon in 3 weeks for a followup, but not sure as to what to do next, if anything.
The thought of waiting another 1/2 year to 'see how things are' doesnt excite me too much, but nor does another procedure. Im therefore hoping that some of you will have been in a similar position and will be able to tell me how it went for you thereafter.
Im now pretty clear that changing the plastic isnt the way forward, given it has some play already. Im not so sure if a further MUA might help, but would do it, if I thought it would.
Looking forward to any feedback, be it positive or otherwise.
Peter..... 53 years old.....

"I am so glad I found this forum.  I had a left partial knee replacement on December 18th and feel quite lucky compared to some of the posts I read about this post-op ""burning pain"".  I am an RN.and used to work on the ....wait for it....orthopedic floor.  So, I though I had a good knowledge base going into this.  My surgery was a partial versus total knee replacement as the doctor did not know what he would find once he opened up my knee.  I felt quite lucky that I only needed a partial knee replacement!  I only had to stay overnight, and my husband has been quite jealous of my progress since he has been comparing it to his TKR 3 years ago.  While I AM walking without a cane now, I still surprised by a burning pain shooting down my thigh, or sometimes calf, when I do certain movements.  I have deduced that it is nerve pain, and have tried to deduce what motions cause it.  On top of that, sleep is still elusive.  I have been reading posts while drinking a mixture of vodka and cran-grape juice.  I have purchased an herbal supplement for sleep and usually take my only pain pill (on non-PT days) before I go to bed.  But so far, I have been unable to get a real good night's sleep.  My 2nd check-up with my orthopod is on February 1st.  I worry that I will be ""released"" to work and will continue to suffer from both the burning nerve pain and lack of sleep.  However, after reading some other posts, I realize that I need to ask my surgeon or my primary for neurotin or some other nerve pain reliever.  Thanks for ""listening"" to my small tales of woe!  I feel relieved to unburden myself to people who can truly empathize.  Please feel free to share your story with me or, even better, offer me words of encouragement!  I am so looking for a post like ""things will get better"".  Oh, I forgot to mention, I also have RA.  Any others out there dealing with surgery recovery and an RA flare?

"Hello,
I am doing a common exercise to improve balance. It involves standing on one leg with other hanging at the side with the foot against the calf.
I am a little wobbly and am experiencing a mild discomfort in the right knee. No problem with the left knee. I alternate between lifting the left and right leg.
I am wondering if the wobble is stretching a muscle/muscles in the knee that accounts for the discomfort, and that this will subside with practice.
The problem does not affect any activity, including walking for long distances.
The exercise seems to be widely recommended in both Yoga and more conventional therapies.
Let me know what you think

"I have been advised I will need a TKR. My consultant has been putting it off due to my age, 53. However, the pain and restriction on my activities now is so debilitating and depressing that I really need to push for it. 
But, apart from the usual qualms about surgery, worse pain ect, I am very concerned that the implant is made from nickel and cobolt. I have had NHS test patch tests done which show I have severe skin allergies to these metals and others. My consultant said it'll be no problem and any evidence of allergic reaction to implant surgery is anecdotal so not to be trusted. 
I would really appreciate hearing from anyone who has had implant surgery and is allergic to one or both of these metals to see whether it caused a problem.

"Some 19 months ago I underwent a total knee replacement followed by months of physiotherapy including using a hydrotherapy pool, but however hard I tried stiffness & a really painful rubbing sensation occurs after I walk for about 5-8 minutes. Whilst in the pool this will subsides but returns when I get out of the pool. I have also undergone an MUA some 8 ,months after the op together with an injection. After this I was able to walk properly but gradually it has gone back & now stiffens & rubs when I walk. Presumably because the effect of the injection has worn off. I do walk for much longer periods but it is extremely wearing & I am wondering if anyone out there had suffered similarly & Has managed to overcome it??

"On 12th October I had a right knee TKR with a false kneecap. I felt from day 1 that there was going to be problems. I was totally fit and healthy before and in my mid 50's. At my 6 week check up  my surgeon said xrays were satisfactory and he was happy with my 90-100 bend and wasn't concerned that I could not straighten leg. Went to see him yesterday and I am still at 90-100 and still cant straighten leg properly and cannot do straight leg lift. He said my quads sustained damage (vastus medialis) in the op but he could operate but would prefer not to and has given me until my 6 month checkup to see how it goes. My knee is  always painful unless I am still and have it slightly bent. It takes me a few steps to straighten. I ice with a cryo cuff each day. have an exercise bike and treadmill at home. I have used a compex rehab machine for the last two months. I have exercised and swam but have now joined a gym so I can do crosstrainer etc and swimming more often . I cannot walk far if not on a treadmill and have only started driving in the last two weeks. I sat on my horse for the first time yesterday and will continue. Please someone tell me it will be alright in the end....that I will get my leg straight in the end..... that I will get a decent bend back and be able to get some of my life back. Anyone else like this at 14 weeks and have recovered well after? My surgeon says there is still swelling and does expect I will gain much more in the next few months....but I feel he is just saying that to make me feel better! I was given the new Attune knee that was supposed to be better! I suppose the one consolation was that he didn't suggest and MUA!

"Almost 18 months now after left knee TKR. I am experiencing weakness and unstable joint. I approached this long before having my surgery by going to the gym for strengthening my right knee which may be why I had my left knee done first. I would not do this surgery again and probably would not have done it knowing my outcome. This is a judgement call everyone of us who is thinking of surgery or had it done. I didn't get any rehab after surgery. I was discharged after 2 days and started doing the exercises I did for the previous 3 years prior to the operation. Surprisingly, these exercises were given to me four weeks later by the physical therapist at the outpatient clinic. I could not do one leg extension with more than 3lbs. I started back at the gym a year ago and I can do 70 lbs. 6 years ago I could do 250 lbs. with both legs on the weight machine. Now I only do 130 lbs. No matter what you must keep on going. Nothing I can say or do to can change things. It may take another year or two for me to work things out. Remember to tell your dentist or doctor about  TKR. My dentist gave me an antibiotic at my teeth cleaning before procedure. Avoid infections at all cost. Anything can happen and knowing how to be careful is a benefit. Anytime you have surgery to parts of your body no matter what area or procedure, you still have a diseased limb, knee, back, etc. There is no cure. It's a treatment only. Good or bad, it's your body and you just have to live with it. I appreciate everyone taking part in the discussions. Happy and healthy life.

"About 6 Months ago I injured my left knee. I might have done damage more than once during a 2 month period.
It was really painful at first. Minimum swelling. Urgent care said a little swelling under knee cap and I have patellafemoral pain syndrome. But does that make sense being an acute injury? It started popping when I extend it. It pops at the very end of knee extension almost like have to push it a bit but it does pop. Sometimes it pops when I am walking and I accidentally extend it too mych. Then sometimes it pops again immediately when I bend it back. It also has a small pop in the middle of extension.
It's a deep pain inside of the knee. It starts at the back of the left knee around my tibia and through the front inside. It's just a deep pain. Well I reinjured it and it popped pretty good, but after swelling now it hurts and pops a little less.
I walk making sure my knee won't extend, keeping it bent and limping. I've tried several braces and they don't help. I can still pop my knee if I step on it wrong and the pain is still there. It's my fault for being such a procrastinator.
Since it feels a little better sometimes as long as I don't really use it do I still need to see a dr? Could it be something other than something serious like a tear?

Anyway....been dealing with body aches and pains for the last three weeks I’d say.....arms, back, shoulders, legs not as much (besides usual pain or swelling in knee if I overdo it). My mom said she had some body aches when recovering....anyone else? Don’t know if it’s because I’ve been more active or....? It’s not like I’m working out or really doing anything super strenuous....
Thanks,

"Hello
I am just over 8 weeks since TKR. I have had 0 extension since day one. I struggled with flexion due to previous operations. I'm now up to 90 and life is more comfortable. Pain has eased off and I'm getting around more. I still have lots of swelling but Physio not concerned. 
However, I am unable to lay face down and pull leg towards bottom. It just won't go higher than around 40 degrees. If I try to hold it there and then push into it, I get pain in knee.  This it the only pain I am currently experiencing. Has anyone has this? I'm not seeing physio for another 2 weeks and unsure whether to push this or not. Prior to operation I could bend knee right to bottom with no problem
thank you

"I was at a rehearsal for a musical im in and we were dancing. As I went down into a kneeling position my knee got a very weird tingling and slightly tight feeling and gave out. I almost fell on the ground and was kinda of afraid to even keep dancing. Luckily we only went through the dance 1 more time and the feeling was very minimal during it. As soon as I got to my car I told my dad and honestly he didnt seem every concerned. After an hour or two the weird feeling mostly went away and I went out somewhere with my family. When I got home and got ready to go to bed though I got the worse knee and lower leg deep pain. It lasted for so long and so I went and took an advil layed in bed for a little bit before it got to the point where it was atleast bearable to fall asleep. I was thinking that might have been from the dancing I had done as whenever I exercise both my legs hurt for a bit, but this time it was only the left one that I had done something weird to earlier. This morning I woke up and when I bend my knee all the way it hurts and when I walk I get a weird feeling thats hard to describe and I dont know how accurate this is but almost a heavy and tight feeling. I dont enjoy putting my full weight on it because it just feels strange. Does anyone have any idea what happened to me or if I should even been concernced?

My OA is so severe now, and I am living in constant agony, with my life basically on hold until my next TKR (49 YO and feel like im on the scrapheap!) Anyway, Ive been reading a bit about K Taping, and thought Id give it a go. I cant BELIEVE how effective it is! The pain is all but gone, the grating bone-on-bone has reduced, and I can get in and out of my house without a crutch/stick! Which I havent been able to do for about 12  month.
I only tried it today for the first time, but by golly Im hooked! The relief is instant, and constant (so far). 
Id be interested to hear if anyone else has tried it, and if the relief is long-lasting or a flash in the pan.

"I am in week 8 post RTKR.   I have just 2 days ago mastered going all the way around (backwards) on my recumbent exercise bike.  My first time all the way around I think I cried out... pain? surprise? and managed to do 3 more cycles around backwards.  My 4th time yesterday it still took almost 20 min of warming up... but then I made myself keep going around and did 20 backwards rotations/cycles.  My question is ... Will it always seem to need the warm up? I know its getting better.  My knee bend at best has been 95* and -15 on my straight.  I woke this morning and lying in bed can hardly bend at all.  I'm off to my physio soon and feel I need to do at least my exercise bike before I go.  I know that there are ups and downs but it seems each day I am almost starting over....

"Because this forum has mixed nationalities it has produced some interesting debates especially when it comes to PO recovery, so I was wondering if US guidelines are similar to those the UK when it comes to getting behind the wheel after surgery.
I've not checked with my insurance company yet but I was told by my PT vehicle insurance automatically stops for a period of 6 weeks, after which it is up to me to decide  if  I'm fit to drive.
When I read some of the posts on here it makes me wonder if this is the best way of going about what is after all a serious decision.
I would have thought a doctors approval giving you the green light would be a minimum requirement, what do you think?

"Hi All-I’m new here so apologies if anything I post is redundant or in the wrong place. I’m 5 months post TKR. Went through all the awfulness of those first 3 months and was finally doing well. Back in the gym, elliptical for 2 miles, long walks, 30 minutes on stationary bike, core work etc. hardly any pain.  Still stiff and tight. Still had some issues going down steps but wasn’t concerned. But last week I took a step that sent a sharp, shooting pain through my knee that almost prevented me from walking. Couldn’t bend my knee at all. Went straight to the md. X-rays were fine. He wasn’t concerned but it’s been a week and while my knee is slightly better I feel like I’m back at month 2 or so. Did a 15 minute walk today and it wasn’t great. Icing, elevating, iboprophen. Trying not to take narcotics. Has anyone experienced a setback like this?

"I had my last physio session yesterday and I'm now 14 weeks post op. My flexion is now 95 degrees and extension 0. This measurement was taken after a 40 minute exercise session involving strength, balance, and ROM exercises so I was fairly warmed up and fully stretched out. So I'm just asking when people say what their ROM is on this forum is that a measurement after physio or is it a measurement taken as soon as you leap out of bed. It takes me a while to stretch out. First thing this morning I was only 80 degrees flexion and it takes me a good amount of time to get it bent to 95 degrees. Another question is will this improve over time?

"hi,
can anyone please tell me how i should be feeling and doing on day 6 total knee replacement.
I know everyone's different but if anyone is feeling the same as me iit may reassure me.
my leg feels like a ton weight and is so stiff and tight.
I am performing all my exercises as told by physio 4 times a day and it is quite a struggle due to the pain in my kneecap, especially straight leg raising. When walking with my elbow crutches which i try to do more of each day,my leg feels very weak and i feel like my knee could give way. I am presuming this is due to weakness in the quads muscle. I am probably wanting to run before i can walk, but i don't feel like i am performing very well, which is making me feel very tearful. I am not usually a giver upper and i'll try my very best as i want the most out of this new knee! Please tell me what you was like in week one. Xx

"EXERCISE   
Is there a preferred  time of day to exercise?, ie before or after meals, early morning or late evening before going to bed, or any time you feel like it.
At 3 weeks PO my PT told me to raise myself off a chair to a standing position then lower myself again without any kind of support ten times daily.
I found that quite hard compared to any other form of exercise including stretching and bending my knee 100 degrees with the aid of a rowing machine. 
Since week 3 my lower leg muscle developed a tightness and is very sensitive to the  touch, it feels like the nerve ends are on fire.
At week 4 because of this tightness it has reached the point where some of my exercises are now restricted.
The chair exercise has now become very difficult but I can still climb the stairs normally and unaided.
I was concerned this stinging nerve sensation could be the start of a blood clot, but a friend who did actually suffer a DVT following a TKR told me he pain is excruciating and I'd certainly know it if I did have a DVT.
Just wondered if anyone else has these symptoms?
ICE AND ELEVATION
How often should you apply ice, my PT says 20mins on and 20mins off  but over what period of time ?
Its recommended elevating the foot above the heart helps the circulation, but again how long for ?

When I’m on my feet for a long time bending the knee is painful. When the knee is sore and I’m sitting at a table I have to straighten my leg otherwise there’s a lot of pain.

"Heyy,
Merry Christmas and a happy new year! 
I’m new to the site but I thought I’d give a shot at asking for some help! 
I’m an 18 y/o climbing Instructor and have suffered with right knee pain for a couple of years now. Recently it got bad to the point where it was unstable and painful without bearing weight. I went to my GP who is a sports team medic (so knew his stuff) and he ordered an MRI as he was concerned about the cartilage. 
I had the scan last week and I’ve just got the report which just states ‘There is not much on your scan except slight wear to medial meniscus but no tear’. I’m obviously very relieved but I’m really surprised as my knee hurt just from laying down during the scan. 
I was a national athlete for discus and running several years back when the pain started after a funny turn to the knee. Ever since then it grinds and pops like a car going over gravel, sore aches when idle, pain when bearing weight (going up/down stairs etc) and when lying down and bending the knee. 
Is this really all just down to ‘slight wear to the meniscus’? How should I go about it now as I really need to do something as I can’t progress in my job if it remains like this? For that reason, I really am open for any treatment options.

"Have been dealing with chronic knee pain for eight months now. Prior to that I was very active -- running, long hikes, rock climbing, etc. I have done 3 months total of PT w/2 different therapists. My MRI was pretty benign, just a moderate amount of edema around my fat pad. I have a slight patellar tilt and maltracking issue. My primary issues seem to be underdeveloped key muscle groups causing a cascade of issues including tight hamstrings and IT bands.
I am doing my therapy and getting by with day to day activities with a 0-2/10 pain by stretching, stick rolling, and KT taping my knee. But I can't walk for more than a mile or two and am certainly not back to running. I picked up these last bits from my last PT which I've worked with for 6 weeks and they have helped the most in managing my pain. I am also getting stronger.
Saw an ortho who I trust -- he offered to do a lateral release of my knee. Said normally PT should be enough but I've not really had substantial relief from it, so this is the next step.
Idk. Does anyone have any recommendations? I could hold off on surgery but timing is an issue for activities I want to do down the line...I'm just not sure...ugh.

"Hi
I am now 10wks post TKR
I still only have a 5 degree straighten and its really worrying me that i will never have a totally straight leg. I still can't walk far and still have a limp. It's a tremendous effort
I have swelling at the back of the knee and severe tightness on top of the knee - all of which affects my gait.
Some days it feels good but mostly i feel i havn't progressed for the last 4 weeks.
Has anyone acheived a straight leg after this time?

"After one and a half years post bilateral TKR and having a problem with “patella clunking syndrome” which I posted in another discussion, I’m finding out that there are “quiet knees” and “noisy knees” with TKRs. Mine are very noisy and have the loudest click with every single step.  Even when I stand and move my knees back-and-forth while they are upright I have loud clicking. I’d love to hear from some of you and find out how many of you have noisy or quiet TKR knees.  What makes some artificial knees quiet or noisy? Is it the type of prosthetic that was used? Mine are custom Smith and Nephew.  Not sure if the custom made any difference!

"Hello everyone,
I had a TKR 11 days ago and this is much harder than expected. Have been pretty much in a constant 5-7 pain level the entire time. I was originally released on hydromorphone, which worked great in the hospital, but didn't help very much after being released.
Have since switched to Percecet, which helps, but still near impossible to get
comfortable for any length of time. Is this normal?
I have only been to 1 physio appt so far since leaving hospital but my ROM is not so great. Before the op, I couldn't straighten my leg better than maybe 18 degrees. I'm under 15 now but expected it to be much better. Is it reasonable to expect to get it to at least 4 or 5 in time? The bend is only at just under 90 so I know there's lots of work ahead of me there as well.
Another thing I have noticed in the past two days, is every once in a while it feels like
someone takes a red hot razor and slices an arc at the side of my leg just below the
knee, or that a very fine cut has just been torn open. It's very hard to describe but man is it brutal. Only lasts a few seconds but stops you dead cold. Has anyone else experienced this?
Than you for any response. It's encouraging beyond words to be able to share experiences with others. Hope I can be of help to others here as well.

"Thanks for all the info. It helps to know that I'm not the only one with pain, this far after surgery.I have considerable pain on the inside of my right knee ever since the surgery which is now 10 weeks. I had also pulled the tendon on the outside of my knee 4 weeks ago, in PT, but that finally seems to be healing. That knocked me back 3 weeks of therapy because that pain was so intense. My bend is at 135, amazing to all, but my straight is only 15. It takes at least 15 minutes to straighten my leg in the morning and I can't walk without holding on to something when I
get up.My worse pain comes at night. Unfortunately, I'm allergic to prescription meds so naproxen is all I can take and that doesn't do much at all. I just got a bike and a stabilizer and spend 15 minutes, 3 or 4 times a day on it. I walk a lot, but somedays that makes it worse. I get frustrated because I can't get down to do things. I just turned 70, but look and act like 55. I was very independent until now and have to depend on my kids to do so many of the things that I could do just 6 months ago. Depression is also something new for me along with 5 out of 7 sleepless nights. I know healing takes time, but 5 weeks ago I stopped using my walker and a week later I stopped needing my cane. Now my cane is with me again. It seems I traded in pain for severe pain and the thought of 9 more months of this..... I want to play golf and garden by March.

"Hello, I am a 15 year old basketball player and I am having lots of knee pain when running, jumping, or basically doing anything intensive with my knees, my right one hurts below the knee, but I just assume that's a growth plate because it's in the general area of where they are located, but for the longest time I have been able to do a weird movement of my knees, no one else can do it and when I do it, it hurts and start throbbing, it hurts I'm guessing on the meniscus.

I scheduled my 2nd tkr for left knee for March 26 2918. I am 5 months post op from right one. I said I’d never do it again but here I am getting ready. I’m hoping I will be more prepared for this one. I am a bit depressed and a lot scared but I can hardly walk from the left knee pain. They said I can use my cane and it won’t hurt my new knee so that is what I am doing. Thank you for your help the last few months(you know who you are) Here I go again

"It's been 9 months, an x-ray, an MRI, and 2 surgeon opinions that there is no structural damage in my knee, and I just have patellofemoral knee syndrome. 
?I'm currently meeting with a physical therapist at Kaiser, and she agrees with their opinion. She's made the bold prediction that perhaps within 3 months I could find myself regaining normal activity. 
?Symptoms: Injury came during a twisting knee motion in swing dance practice. There were popping noises that have since ceased, but still there remains a sense of instability in my right knee. Never any swelling, however, nor itchiness, redness, nor stiffness. 
?Right now, I am able to work out on the elliptical, however when I'm done, merely getting into my car and putting my right foot up on the gas pedal can cause a sharp pain to shoot across the inside of my left knee. This pain can then travel to the front and up to the side. Stepping up onto stairs, unless I do so carefully, can also cause said pain. .  
?I would appreciate your thoughts and well wishes, and opinions if you think there could be something structurally wrong with me. An assistant and two surgeons have looked at my MRI, and they all say there is ZERO structural damage.   I just turned 30 and want to resume normal activity: being able to run 2-3 days a week and swing dance twice a week. I'm going crazy! 
Thanks, 
?Ben

"Today marks my one year anniversary of my TKR.  One year ago I would not have thought that I would be walking, jumping and yes, even hopping. Running is coming along slowly. To those of you beginning the long journey of recovery, I can say ( without hesitation), that you will be pain free. You will be enjoying your life. I know how difficult it it is to believe , as you cry through PT and count the hours until you can have more pain medication, that you will ever get through this brutal recovery. Take your time and be patient. It really does take a year to get through this surgery.  This forum got me through my darkest days. You were all here for me. Thank you all for the support, kind words and honest conversation.

Well after waiting a year after LTKR I finally managed to get in to see my surgeon & get signed off & back on the waiting list for RTKR, as that was 25/1017 I didn't imagine I would be getting my op until Spring if 2018. Imagine my surprise when I was phoned on the 1st December offering a date for 16th December! Gobsmacked!! What with impending Christmas the last 2 weeks have been manic! What with PreOp assess, Therapy session & blood tests!
So I had my op 16 hours ago & all fine, well as fine as these things go in the first few days! Hence being on here at 02.53am! Had a wobble at around 22.30 & a good cry, but had to give myself a good talking to! 
Can't sleep, knee not too bad but lower back has decided to play up, can't get comfy, too tired to read & I thought I know a group of people who will really understand! So, just thought I'd share with you & catch up. Hope to speak again soon

"My story, well read lots on here and listened to advice, best you can get from those who have been through it. 
Decided to have spinal block and sedation as apposed to full anaesthetic with last TKR 2 years ago.
Felt brave and in control and it was the right decision for me. All went to plan woke up and felt great on day one, was able to bend the knee to 90 degree and lift the leg and walk to bathroom with walking frame.
Hardly any sleep for 24 hours, that was battle one. Next morning was a total different situation, got very clammy and light headed and passed out in bed. Slept for a while and managed a little physio. Then the fun began, they sent the wheelchair to take me to xray, felt clammy and lightheaded and passed out just outside xray department, felt awful took a far few staff to eventually transport me back to bed and on oxygen for a few hours. Blood tests showed low HB but not enough for transfusion. Also had a slight chest infection. With lots of sleep and basic attention managed to go home on Monday evening (day 4).
Slowly improving and today I have felt a lot more myself today, walking with crutches and managing with help to have shower each day and plenty of sleep, rest, ice and exercise.
First proper physio is Sunday and having it at home so will update you after.
Thanks to everyone for their support on my journey.

"Hi Laura
Firstly l want to take back my apologie for writing my experience on my 2nd TKR. Firstly l don't think you know how the forum works. Its not all rainbows and unicorns. People come on to share there story of what is going on with them. I don't appriciate being told l should not write my experience with my 2nd TKR. I am not 5 years old and l am not gonna lie about being in pain.
I am sure a lot of people will agree with me on, we should share our experience good or bad. You don't know me so you have no right telling me off for telling the truth. I was in agony for a few days even with heavy medication. Anyone that tells you a TKR is pain free must be lying or dors not feel pain. I have been on this forum for years and am a 6? because l know how to give advice and take it. I am 44 years old and have had every joint replaced in past 3 years. I have had to give up work. My full life has changed. I accept that. But l was upset at you telling me off for telling the truth. I am sure the regulars will agree.....l hope. I have physio that l will need to start soon. I have a car l can't drive. Oh and l have also had an ankle fusion. The fact you never even responded to my aplologie hurt. As l said l just lost my mum a few months ago and am still grieving. So Laura l would have a look at some of the posts they are not all happy stories. I have gave posative feedback on my hip replacements as they were brilliant. So please never speak a word to me as you cant even acknowlege my apologie. Which now l wish l had never gave.

"Hi
I had my left knee replaced about a year ago and when l was being given anasthetic to put me out you also get a injection in your groin which numbs the leg from waist down. I never seen them give me it as l must have been asleep. But l defo got it as when you wake you can't feel your leg for a while and it feels like a tonne weight.
Well l had my right knee done on the 21st. My surgery was at 6pm at night and it was same consultant and anaesthetist and she told me she had started a new way of numbing the leg and it had been very sucesful. This time they done it in front of me. What they do is an ultrasound further down your leg just above my knee. So you see it on the screen they look for the muscle and inject loads of this stuff in while she watches on the screen. Then l was put asleep.
Well l have to say it made a huge diffrence. The did not think l would be up and about the next day but l was at 7am with very little pain. And it continued for a few days and l was home. Then suddenly l got the pain l had with my 1st one it was agony. So l never got away with the pain on knee replacement it was just delayed. I spent 2 days crying with pain and the 3rd it started to ease. Thank god thats my last one for a while. Had 2 new hips and 2 knees and an ankle fusion all in 2 to 3 years. Hard going.

It can start any time of day or night striking any area from the ankle to mid thigh. 
I try hard to ignore it but eventually have to slap on  E45 which thankfully does calm things down.
Also 2 weeks post op my shin in particular and to some extent my calf became tender to the touch.
I've had this tightening of the lower leg for 7 days now and it does not appear to be improving, just wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience.
Surgery was recommended 5 years before I finally had it done and apparently in that period my leg had taken up a slightly bent position. (something I hadn't noticed)
The surgeon said he would sort this out by stretching it at the same time he did my knee.
Wow, I think he must have used the ""Rack"" the back of my leg was black and blue and so swollen, it gave me some real stick.
I also noticed some bruising round the ankle and top of my thigh, probably anchor points before stretching, who knows.
I wonder if any surgeons read the feed back on this forum and are tempted to explain why so many different symptoms occur post op.

Of course the pain killers became ineffective and there have been times i've not been able to walk. I live alone and i guess many of you will know pain especially in the night is not a good thing. I have had depression on and off for years, but it has really got worse.
After a talk with my Gp  i was referred for an MRI - I see him this week to talk about the results. Then yesterday i had a letter from the hospital asking me to go back for an x ray.  This has really worried me - why would they need to do an x ray ? What could the MRI have shown up ? Questions questioons???? Could anyone here possibly give me any idea of why etc especially if it's happened to them PLEASE
i hope to hear from people soon. kind regards lynn

"Ok, I’m fussing again. Had a patellar femoral replacement 9/20.  Bend is good, straightening is good.  Stairs are still painful as is kneeling.  On the outside of my knee it is continuously swollen; acknowledged by Dr and PT folks.  The Dr said it’s fluid. Is there ever a point where this fluid is drained?  I am just feeling like this is what is pressing on everything and making it very uncomfortable.
I am going back to work next week, I mostly sit at a desk - that is a whole other set of issues as I have discovered sitting for any length of time and then trying to get up and walk, well that’s fun!  
I’m thinking I need to see the Dr one more time before I return to work and ask about this fluid/swelling?
Anyone????

"Hi Everyone! 
Had surgery TKR on Aug 17th my physical therapist has mostly focused solely on ROM which is improving but hasn’t really been focused on how straight I can get the knee. So I am getting nervous. What exercises would be good for straightening. I do have a cylinder device I can put under ankle and let leg hang there would that be helpful? Are balancing exercises useful in this purpose? I just don’t know. Chico has described one exercise having lower leg Hang over bed but I am afraid as I can’t exactly invision the correct position. Anyway any ideas please advise.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is my pt being too aggressive? My knee feels so much better during the weekend when I have several days off of pt but as soon as I go back to pt, I start all over again with the swelling and pain.

I knew it was bone on bone but tried to ignore it. I am using a walker once again and the pain is now over shadowing the operated leg. I have an appointment with surgeon in February for recheck of tkr, I guess I will wait to do something till then. I am so upset. Can my body take another horrible surgery? It will only have been six months. I’m praying the left leg starts feeling better, maybe I’ve just been doing too much. Please reply, I need all of your wisdom.

"Today is one year + 1day post bilateral pkr -(and subsequent arthroscopic removal of a bone spur in May 2017 on left side).
Hard to believe.....
The pain,lack of sleep, insanity,scar tissue, sensation changes, swelling (and more swelling),depression,mobility have (mostly) all resolved.
My cycles of feel good, do more,get a setback are over.
I still get some tiny trace swelling in my left ankle. My left side gets a little achy.
Overall, flex and extension remain excellent -3/140.
I ACTUALLY HAVE shape to my leg and a KNEECAP instead of two massive tree trunks.
I can comfortably walk 2-3miles at 3mph on the treadmill. I can go up and down stairs without clinging one to the handrail in fear of falling or to hoist myself up. I have equal balance and dont limp or wobble to one side.
My sensation in the knees are still not 100% but changes weekly to more feelings.
Some days i know they are there and other days they are so much a part of me, the scars are all that prove i had surgery.
Kneeling is still sensitive but doable-padding helps.
I have had maybe 5 pain pills (includes post arthroscopy) since one month out but still take 400mg ibuprofen most every day.
I haven't returned to my baseline energy since the last surgery but accept my ""new normal"" which means i get A LOT done but all with rest periods in between. What used to take 3 days to do may take 5 days or 3 weeks. I dont care. I care that I CAN DO IT.
I got lazy about stretching and tight hips and back pain were my ""reward"". So, stretching is an EVERY DAY occurance with the immediate benefit of no more tight hips or back pain.
My doc one year follow up is the first Friday in December.
I look forward to the date with my snowshoes since skiing is frowned upon.
Perserverance. I screamed,cried,yelled some more,researched,asked questions,did my PT diligently and i PERSERVERED.
All of you will to. This journey is an enigma. No ONE is alike despite all the similarities. Be kind to yourselves. Be diligent but mostly, perservere. ""I CAN"" does more for the recovery process than anything else.
Good luck to all the ""kneebies""

"I had my op eleven days ago and since then I've not been able to contact the hospital and speak to the ard sister or senior nurse regarding when I can leave my dressing or compression socks off.
A couple of days after surgery the wound was still leaking badly and I'd already used the two dressings supplied by the hospital.
The chemist had nothing suitable in stock and they required a doctors prescription to order the correct size dressings which I found unbelievable, I mean its not as if I was ordering an A class drug.
I made do over the weekend by joining large plasters together, not really ideal but they did the job.
The wound has healed up pretty good now and looks great but I'm not sure if I can leave the dressing off as I don't want anything nasty getting in causing problems.
I'm getting fed up with the surgical stockings which are really digging into my calves,  probably restricting circulation rather than helping it
Some medical sites recommend removal of both two weeks post op, others say you must follow your surgeon's advice. 
I would certainly do the later if it were possible to contact him 
I realize there's no set in stone procedure and we all progress differently but I would be interested  what advice anyone received from their consultant

"I forgot to tell you all yesterday that I've decided to put my second tkr on hold for now. Initially there was going to be a year between them. My first one was the 18 Sept this year. When I had my follow up with the surgeon yesterday I told him that my knee had been OK. (the one still to be done). Anyway, we decided not to go any further at the moment and he said to come back when I feel it's time and his door is always open. It might be a total difference when I go back to work. I'll wait and see. I'm only 51 so I'd rather wait as long as I can. He said it isn't quite as bad as the other one was but it's getting there

"Hello,
So I am 23 and have had knee issues for over two years now. I played a lot of football 4-5 times a week, 3G pitch and Sunday league. 2 years ago I damaged my left knee and kept playing on it, long story short I went to doctors and had an MRI on my left knee, it showed no damage and had physio. However the pain started appearing in my right knee but worse than before. Again MRI and again, nothing major , little bit of cartilage damage. However, on the results it says I might have ‘compression knee’ - none of the doctors knew what this was and google doesn’t say anything ever. I hope you guys may help.
The pain is a weird pain that’s hard to explain, my knees ache when bent and when I stretch my leg flat the pain goes away for a while, if I excercise the pain is bad and gets a lot worse when sometimes I cannot walk - however I have no swelling at all.
Please some advise would be great - I have been allowed physio again but I am waiting to book a meeting
Thanks
Kieran

" I posted a similar discussion on another board, but realized this one is a little more active.  Anyways, I had a Tibial Avulsion Fracture and Meniscus tear while riding dirt bikes back in May of this year (5/21/2017).  After doing about 3 weeks of pre-op physical therapy I had my first surgery (6/12/2017).  The doctor was able to suture the bone fragment back down to my shin bone and then sew up the meniscus.  I started PT a week later. It was then that I realized my knee had completely stiffened up due to excessive scar tissue growth.  My ROM was only 15-35. After several failed weeks of trying to work through it with aggressive therapy, I eventually had my second operation (7/19/2017).  This was a Manipulation Under Anesthesia and Lysis of Adhesions, through my original surgery wounds.  I then continued PT up until about the middle of October.  My knee is doing much better now, but it is still not where I want it to be.  My ROM has kind of hit a wall around 8-125 and this is causing me to limp.  I still have pain doing pretty simple activities and my knee constantly pops all throughout the day.  If I skip even a day of doing exercises it will stiffen up on me and become more painful.  I try and go to the gym Monday through a Friday where I continue all the exercises I learned in therapy and also ride a stationary bike for about 15-20 minutes.  I am wondering if anyone here has suffered from this injury before, and if so, where are you today?  I am contemplating on going to see another doctor here in town to get a second opinion.  I'm afraid I won't be able to get back riding again or even doing some more simple forms of activity.  Any advice/experiences are helpful.  Thank you.

"I had my partial knee replacement six months ago and my leg and knee have been swelling and hurting on and off ever since.  I saw my ortho MD on several occasions, went to my primlary MD who sent me for Bp of legg, had CT scan went to neurologist, etc.  Finally, after standing one day at work and not being able to walk, I went to the walk-in ortho clinic and the Physician Assistant looked at my x-ray and said there was foreign debrie in it.  I finally got hold of ortho doctor who looked at the xray and said yea there's a peace of cement broken off that might be scraping a nerve and causing pain.  The last six months he has made me feel like I was drug seeking.  He would not give me any pain meds before or since, said take Tylenol and motrin.  I have kidney disease and am not suppose to take a lot of motrin but it is the only thing that calms the pain.  This is not pain every day but when it happens its like no other pain I've ever had - feels like my knee cap is rotating and can't put weight on that foot.  MD said I could get knee scoped to remove cement or do nothing - NOTHING!!!!!  NOTHING!!!!  I am 67 years old, is it because doctors just don't care about us at a certain age or does he deny my pain.  So frustrated with this MD that I like.

"This is the one thing that worries me. First thing in the morning my knee looks fine but now that I'm 10 weeks post op I've been going out with friends say for a meal, today we walked to the pub for lunch which is roughly about half a mile. I took my stick but to be honest I could probably have managed without it. We must have been sat for a couple of hours but when I got to stand up there was considerable swelling in my knee and thank god I did take my stick. I managed to walk home and then ice and elevated. The swelling does cause considerable pain and obviously prevents ROM. So has anybody got any ideas of what I can do to help prevent swelling when doing activities, this is going to be the one thing that stops me going back to work I can't really sit there with my leg elevated and ice pack on while I'm at work. If I strengthen the knee does this really help. HELP! I really need to get back to work  cheers sue x

"I woke up 5 years ago with limited motion and quad pain. I could always touch my heel to butt. Now 8 inches away.  After about a year I went to knee surgeon. Xrays revealed little to no cartridge in medial part of knees. I got Cordizone injections, 6 months later did it again. This seemed to take pain away from quads and move it to medial part of joint. Six months hyaluronic acid knee injections. Six month went to stem cell doctor. Repeated above followed by body fat and blood platelet injection. This was followed by platelet injection 6 months later. Nothing has changed. I'm good as long as I do no put my knees in straight position. I hobble around. I can lift or push heavy item at work with little pain. I feel this helps from atrophy. Walking and standing long period hurt medial part of knees. How long should stem cells take? I have heard so many bad thing about knee replacement. I am getting more bow legged. Could I have something beside OA? I was checked for pretty much everything in including RA. I have tried almost everything from fire ants to DMSO with no results. Has any been done this same path? My surgeon say wait on surgery until  can not live with the pain. He says 55 is too young. I take nothing for pain since nothing seems to take away pain. Advice please.

I don't understand how I can keep struggling to get to120. I have made 120 4-5 times now and it's hard each time so obviously can't get to even 121. Why is this an issue? It just seems once you make it you should be good and ready to move forward not struggling to plateau. 
I will just keep plugging away and hope a miracle happens. Also, not sure really if pain med is all that helpful. Might be better just going in w/o and use an anti inflammatory instead.

I saw my Consultant at 7 weeks post op and achieved 110 ROM and do not need a stick any longer.  My problem now is with my left knee which he has put me back on the list to have replaced saying I should be in line for the op in Jan:Feb time. 
I am looking forward to getting it over and done with as want to then take time to heal properly as I know it takes a year or so to completely recover. 
I’d just like to hear from those of you who have had both knees done and what time did you leave in between ops?

"I went to turn quite quickly at work and heard a popping sound in my right knee, straight after pain and fell to the floor. I sat for bout 5/10 mins, then even hurt abit stayed working....for the next 7 days, there was swelling and pain but i just thought they would go on they own and took pain killers etc. My job is a communtiy support worker to elderly clients in their own homes. After these 7 days as mentioned above, i had a week's annual leave, and went in our caravan to Norfolk, my leg got worse, kept me awake, hurting and so painfully, so went to local hosp, saw a nurse practioner - she said think had ACL injury, after assesing my knee with moving it around, she told me to rest leg, ice packs and get physio once back home...she gave me stronger pain killers. On returning home, had to take sick leave, walking with crutches, pain very bad, local gp, said to rest it, and use ice packs and gave me anti-flammatory meds, and put me down for physio. In meantime whilst waiting on physio, leg had good and bad days, limp on my leg with crutches, have pain constant directly back of knee, and left side of knee, pain up thigh to just down ait from my groin area, went back docs, gave me sick note and said needed rest, by now had been off nearly 8 weeks, saw physio therapist, she said she thought i had a acl injury, and said wot the docs had said, but gave me three excerises to do, carried on doing these, but leg started to get worse, went bk going on 10 weeks, physio said leg not healing properly, and until have a scan she can't do anymore, she wrote to my gp, so now i'm been off work nearly 13 weeks, and finally got a scan at the end of this month, however last few days my leg has got a lot worse, ive had numbness and pins and needles, coldness in my leg and foot, i get alot of twitching of nerves, and still so much pain......last time docs gave my stronger meds, but help alittle. I have to pick my knee up to turn it at times, and can't bend at times, sometimes it works and sometimes not, depending on angle of it. I can;t use it like i used to and sometimes if try to weight bear just gives out, but lately the numbess and cramp right up to my toes happens alot.... just wondered if anyone could give me some advice please. My husband thinks of some serious damage and prob have to have surgery, but i'm not sure. Just know since i popped the knee all them weks ago feel nhs as let me down alittle.

"I am having my 2nd TKR on 8th Dec and been reading about the Aircast Knee Cryo Cuff with Cryo Cuff Cooler Saver Pack can you let me know if you have purchased and used one and do you think it speeded up your recovery as it should help reduce the swelling and pain and help movement.
Or have you used anything similar, the reason for asking was last TKR the swelling and pain went on forever it seamed and it was the swelling mainly which hindered the bending, and I am hoping if I get everything into place ahead of the op, maybe it will help my recovery.

"Hi everyone, I had my 6 week check up on Thursday. I was dreading it as I knew I was not at full extension and about 95 degree bend. The surgeon did not seem worried by the fact that I was still -5 and only 95 ROM. He said it was early days and I will get there. I suppose I should be thankful that he did not put any pressure on! Anyway, is this normal? I was extremely fit before operation and had full use of leg right up to day of op so I had expected a quick speedy recovery. I have really struggled and only feel that in the last week I am getting somewhere. I am not allowed to give up my crutches at the moment and have been told I can drive and ride horses when I feel ready which I know will still be a few weeks. Has anyone been at these levels at 6 weeks and now have a good ROM? I suppose I am regretting my decision to operate and need reassurance.
I must say that without this group I think I would have given up by now!!

Dr took x-rays and said everything looks fine but you need to strenthen your quad.  PT therapist said it was the IT band. We have been working on strengthening and all of the sudden yesterday, my knee locked (I cannot straighten it out) was intensely painful and I had to hobble with my knee bent to get around.  Before this all happened I was walking fine, dancing and all of the above with no problems.  I am freaking out over this and now feel disabled.   Has anyone else experienced this?

"Just wanted to thank you all for your kind advice and support. 
 I’m almost three weeks in. Pain has def lessoned and sleeping better. Can get leg straight (although can’t lift yet but Physio not concerned)
I still can’t master the bend. I can push myself to get to almost forty degrees. But only after numerous ice treatments. Additionally, I’m using my other leg as to guide and bend operated leg down and will not just let my operated leg drop. It’s clearly all in my mind as I can get to 80 on cpm. Physio now getting worried. 
I rationally know that I won’t break it but my mind won’t let go. Physio thinks it’s due to all the previous surgeries I have had. I have searched on internet and can’t se anyone rise who has had this problem. 
I know there is no magic answer. Just need to let off steam.

So this morning i woke up with some very sharp knee pain which seems to have occured overnight. I have never had any issues with my knees and in the days leading up to today ive had no signs of knee soreness, it only just came on when i woke up. Its a pretty sharp pain on the medial side of my left knee. It hurts to flex and extend and i can barely run without the pain. Things like sidesteps (only when going to my right side) and skipping with a skipping rope are fine though.
I have no idea how or why i have this knee pain. Also i have iced it all day, put cream on it and still painful. Does anyone know what sort of injury this is or can anyone suggest any treatments to help make the pain go away?

"From BoneSmart org...
When Restless Leg Syndrome occurs after a TKR, it is usually related to the surgical procedure itself. It is unavoidable that some nerve bundles and possibly the superficial fibular nerve are injured. As you heal, scaring of neural and non-neural tissues occurs differently among different individuals. The various ways in which tissues heal following surgery is likely what determines whether a person develops RLS symptoms or not. It is normally a temporary problem that resolves itself with time. However, while it’s going on, RLS can be very uncomfortable and result in extreme fatigue because of lack of quality sleep.
From the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)...
Our results suggest that secondary unilateral restless legs syndrome may ensue from knee prosthesis surgery and that the symptoms are generated in the peripheral nervous system.
Symptoms...
* Strange itching, tingling, or ""crawling"" sensations occurring deep within the legs. These sensations sometimes occur in the arms.
* Involuntary movement or jerking of the legs while asleep or while awake and at rest. If you are asleep when this happens, the movement wakes you up and keeps you awake as it continues.
* A compelling urge to move the limbs to relieve these sensations.
* Restlessness, pacing, tossing and turning in bed, rubbing the legs.
* Sleep disturbance and daytime fatigue.
Conclusion...
So, it is possible to get RLS from knee surgery.  See your GP for a definitive diagnosis and treatment.  This could be temporary or not...can't tell.  Also, you need to know if it's definitely RLS.  I've personally had RLS for almost 20 years now.  Tried some Parkinsons and epilepsy meds.  No change and too many side effects.  Doc an I settled on 1 mg Xanax (Alprazolam) 15 minutes before bedtime.  Stopped all the twitching and let me get to sleep.
Again...you may have RLS or not, but you can see from the above sources that it is a definite possible side effect of the surgery.  See your doc...get relief regardless of what they say it is.

"Hello
18 months ago I had a partial KR. twice in the last 6 months I have had to have fluid removed which was blood. I was told that I may need to have a total. I am freaking out to say the least. Has anyone else had to go through this ?
I am doing alright as long as I don't do any lifting (maybe this is what causing the fluid ?) (hence part of the reason to have had the PKR was because I wanted to be able to lift , carry grandchildren.) I am 59. Plus I run a business so the thought of having the total and being laid up as much as I here from on this site it is with the total is making me nausea. I was back at it at 4 weeks with the partial. I did very good  with recovery.
It isn't urgent that I have it done but I feel as though I am back to having to be ""careful"" with the PKR until at which time I decide to do the total. I am still very happy that my leg is straight which I became very knocked kneed prior.  And for the most part I think I am doing pretty good except when these flair ups occur.
Tomorrow I am going in for x-ray, extraction
 and cortisone shot.
I know how painful the extraction is but never had cortisone shot. Is it true they are also as horrific as the extraction of fluid?
Thank you.

"2017 has not been a good year. I had arthoscopic on my left knee in March. This cleanup worked, but made my knee a lot looser due to an acl injury that happened 20 years ago. Next option was to tighten the knee with reconstructive surgery. After talking to the doc about the condition of my knee and the removal of the inserted acl, we decided to bypass the reconstructive surgery and go with a tkr in June. My ROM has been bad, it feels as of the is a hard stop at 90 degrees, a lot of pain trying to progress past 90 degrees, and the new knee feels and looks huge (overstuffed). I have had 25 sessions at physical therapy, 3 different therapist say the knee is so dang tight. I had a manipulation a few weeks ago and also has a small amount of scar tissue removed, but the knee is right back where it was before the last surgery. At what point do you look for a second opinion on a possible revision? My knee bent 130 degrees before the tkr. I am 44 and I need to get back to work 100%.

"I went to the doctor on this past Thursday, and they told me that there was nothing else they could do for the chronic stiffness in my knee. I had TKR July 12, 2016, a MUA one month later, and a revision January 30.2017. I had two operations before TKR, and I'm prone to generating scar tissue at a rapid pace. I was issued a machine called a flexinator and I put my leg into it and it bends the leg at the knee. You pump it until you get a really good stretch and you're supposed to hold it in this position for ten minutes. It's very painful because it keeps your knee in a uncomfortable position and when I release the pressure, I can barely walk on my leg. I have to walk it out. The therapist told me that I have to get use to it, but my knee turns red and swells. Has anyone used this machine and what advice can you give me? I have trouble keeping the range of motion gained during my exercises.

"You've been told you need a TKR...and that's scary.  Being on this site and getting to know what's ahead of you is a major step because the more information you have, the better prepared you'll be.  If your doc says that a TKR is your only option and your quality of life is pretty much zero, then you should consider getting the op done as soon as possible.  At 20 months post-op, I have no regrets, regardless of the three biggest issues: the intense but short-term pain, the amount of work it takes to return to normal and length of the recovery.  However...
There is Synvisc, and products like it.  After 4 knee scopes (two each side) plus arthritis left me hanging in my 50's, the doc used Synvisc (three shots, days 1, 8 and 15) to keep me going for 5-6 years when I was living in New Jersey.  Each round lasted close to a year.  Moved to the warmth of Texas in 2010 and that change in climate left me pain-free for another five before needing the TKR.  No guarantees but Synvisc worked amazingly well for me. I asked the doc about more of it in January 2016 before the TKR in March and he told me that the left knee was so bad that the injections would do very little for me at that point so I bit the bullet and did the op.  Just a thought...talk to your surgeon.
The most difficult part of facing the reality of a TKR is that, going into the op, no one knows how difficult or long their recovery will be.  There are very, very few people who have quick (less than 3 months) or lengthy (greater than 18 months) recoveries.  For the vast majority of us, this takes a year...accept it.  People typically return to work in the 4-6 month range depending on how well they've recovered, age, type of job, and many other factors.  You cannot expect to be ""OK"" in three months...you just can't.  You may be lucky and end up with a fast recovery buy you cannot count on it.
On the subject of returning work, a sedentary desk job is easier to return to than construction, delivery, nursing, etc., all those professions which require a lot of walking and leg strength.  Even those at a desk report a lot of pain and swelling when finishing the day after sitting so long.
The problem is that you cannot push a knee to recovery.  Try, and it bites you back...big time.  Pain, swelling, exhaustion, inability to walk, etc.  I once did 8,200+ steps at 5 weeks and paid for it with a ""balloon knee"" for three days.  The knee heals gradually.  It will take you up to 3 months just to get your ROM back to at least 0 / +120...then you have to rebuild the strength in your dead quads, glutes and core to walk properly, climb stairs, etc.  That takes up to a year post-op.  By 8 months, I was doing 11,000+ steps (5 miles) with no ill effects...but it took time, work, patience and a healthy respect for the new knee.  Most people report ""feeling like themselves again"" at 9-10 months and rejoice at their ""full recovery"" on their one-year anniversary...very common.
THIS IS IMPORTANT: For a TKR, there can be no expectations, no timetables.  It is the most Zen of all surgeries: ""Your knee will be better when it's better.""  Anyone promising you that you will be fully recovered and back to work in 3 months is delusional.  I'm not saying it's impossible as we've had a few of those unlikely success stories reported on the Forum, but those are very rare. 
So, if you have this question in your mind: ""Will I make it through three months?"", the answer is OF COURSE!  It will painful, difficult and challenging.  Will you be able to go back to work at that point?  The truth is: Not likely. The problem for you (and for all of us at the beginning) is that you never know the real answer to the question of time to recovery and no one can predict how recovered you will be any point in time. 
If you want to read about the realities of recovery from my personal perspective and after reading thousands of posts, I've posted a lot of discussions about pain, sleeping, depression and many more on the Forum.  Click on my name or picture and then ""See All Discussions"".  
The one great thing you're doing is educating yourself about the op.  Virtually all of us were told nothing pre-op and we all had the same impossible expectations to deal with afterward.  The truth is that it's a brutal operation with a lot of pain to endure in the first 30 days or so.  Then it takes a lot of PT and work at home to regain your ROM followed by walking and strength exercises to build back all that musculature.  All of this takes time...you just don't know how much at the beginning and no one can predict the length of your recovery.  
In the end, it's not scary at all.  You go to sleep, wake up and have a new knee.  Simple.  Then you start to walk IMMEDIATELY.  Manage the pain, ice, elevate, eat healthy, hydrate a lot, do the necessary work.  The pain will fade and you will find that all your original pain will be gone too.  In a year, you will be sooooo glad you took the time and did the work to lead a pain-free, normal life again.  Well, almost normal.  There will be things you will NOT do anymore like running, jogging and competitive sports...but that list is in another post...  I played hockey for 45 years and had to give it up...not easy emotionally but a no-brainer choice.  Stay strong...take your life back.

"Am patiently waiting for knee replacement op in NHS Scotland after being told last January that I had Osteo Arthritis in my left knee and that my cartilage is badly worn so op is only way to correct the problem. My frustration is still can't get a date and told the wait will be extended again as NHS are not doing any elective surgery over Christmas and New Year.  Reading about this op it seems that exercise afterwards is the main way back to recovery, but as each day goes past now, my right knee is getting worse and they have not even looked at that, as when walking with my stick I am putting most of my weight on my right side to take pain off my left knee. Advised cycling was good exercise to prepare for op, but had to stop that due to Prostate problems and also waiting for op to have that removed.  Have tried knee supports with little success, anything else I can try  ?.   Afraid the waiting time is getting me down and can't afford Private treatment as already committed to dental implants in two weeks time. The joys of getting old !.

"I've had pain in my right knee on and off for the last 20 years but the last 5 or 6 it has got progressively worse. I had various mri scans and x rays early last year which showed quite severe osteoarthritis in my left leg but only very mild oa in my right knee with a torn meniscus. I had an arthroscopy and repair of the meniscus just over a year ago but the pain just keeps getting progressively worse. The consultant doesn't have any answers so I had another mri last week to see if I've got rapidly deteriorating arthritis. I'm at my wits end and getting more and more down as I can only walk for a short time before the pain kicks in. Any advice appreciated.

I know some have had infections and wondering what the symptoms would be . The only thing I’ve done different is had grandkids overnight and carried baby up and down stairs bunch of times . But seriously that should not cause this . I’m getting worried and anxious about this .

" OK I have made the measurement of 120 for the past three visits at PT. I am 13 weeks post op so this is a slow process for me. They have increased weight on machines and I can do it but today I feel like a strain in back of knee prior to measurement and I think that made me struggle to get to 120. I desperately want to go a bit higher than 120 could the increase in weight have caused tightness in leg? Otherwise, on PT I want to go lighter on weight and get measurement and on non PT days add a little more weight to strengthen. Any ideas? PT said bike still best thing for ROM so keep that up.

"Hi there, 
I fractured my patella playing football 10 days ago. I did not realise the seriousness of the injury so carried on walking on the joint (with a limp) until this week. I just saw a knee specialist. The MRI shows no ligament or meniscus damage and a fracture that is not that deep apparently but is 1.2 cm at its longest point. The specilaist said that as I have been walking and bearing weight on the leg for the last 10 days - I may as well continue to walk and allow the bone to heal naturally over the next 6-8 weeks. 
He has not given me a cast or even a leg brace and said not to use crutches now. 
I can walk quite well on the leg, it does hurt and feel weak. 
Should I be worried that the joint won't heal as I am continually bearing weight and moving on it?
Many thanks in advance for any advice.

I could barely walk and was afraid I had a blood clot. The Dr. sent me for an ultrasound of my leg ASAP and I was diagnosed with a ruptured Baker's Cyst. That was 3 days ago and I am still in quite a bit of pain in my calf. The swelling in my foot is better, but the pain is still pretty bad.

"I had TKR left knee on October 25, 17 days ago. Under NJ law, doc says he cannot give me any more Percocet 5-325 (got total of 100 at 1 every 4 hours which lasted until today) and he urged me to use Advil or Tylenol. Tylenol doesn't work for me and Advil is hard on my stomach, which is already compromised from gastric surgery. Right now, I am using some 10-325 Vicodin that I have here in my medicine cabinet. I am stretching what I have out to every 8 hours and supplementing with Advil to try to stretch supply. I feel that I need the pain killer for 1.) sleep, which is a nightmare and 2.) before outpatient PT which I start in two days. My doctor keeps telling me how I should be able to handle this with Advil. I found his attitude insulting. His attitude was ""it is out of my hands"" and ""lots of my patients never take pain medication"".. which made me feel terrible and weak and depressed. Doc said had to send me to Pain Management but you call them and they are booking appointments three and four weeks out! I don't want to be on Pain meds then!  My in-home PT says I am doing really well. And, as long as I had the pain under control, I was feeling really good and optimistic. Now, facing the prospect of not having any RX pain killers just three weeks in and still in a lot of pain, I am depressed and angry. I would have expected to get at least a 30 day supply of RX pain meds for such major surgery. Had staples out three days ago. Had x-ray. Doc said everything looks good. I ice and elevate almost constantly. Is it normal to still need RX pain killers 17 days in?

The X-rays and blood results shows everything is normal so unsure what it is but was given antibiotics for a week to take and also advised that if it spreads then to go back asap. What could this be? Could it be side affects from cocodomel or because of a lot of walking? Any responses would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

"I am 8 weeks out of a total knee replacement on my right knee. My left knee was doing fine until this past week. I've always had a tad of arthritis in the good knee and it would make crunching sounds while going up the stairs but never really hurt.
I'm having trouble getting up the stairs one at a time because my operated knee is still very weak and the good knee has started getting sharp shooting pains.
Unfortunately I have formed adhesions in the operated knee which is not allowing me to get full flexion and I have to go in for manipulation this Tuesday. That is when they put you under anesthesia and the surgeon manually forces your knee to full flexion. After the procedure I will have more swelling, more pain, and more weakness in that knee which means even more stress on my good knee. I'm afraid I won't be able to use either knee to get around during my now extended recovery. Has anyone gone through this, or is currently going through this, that has advice on how to keep the good knee from falling apart.

?I said gardening. Then he said be careful in kneeling might crack the knee cap. He showed me pictures of before and after surgery results. Where they screw the plastic into the knee cap they have to cut the bone to make the plastic fit properly, so in kneeling I don't have much bone left in the knee cap.
I was wondering has anyone else tried to kneel yet?

"I am having a partial knee replacement in the next few months but have read quite a lot of articles mostly negative and I am now wondering if I should go ahead with it or just put up! 
Im 57 I like to walk each day I wear sensible shoes and have soles in them from the podiatrist to keep my leg aligned. Will I still be able to walk each day once fully recovered and if so how far will distance be restricted?
i have also read that your sleep is very disturbed after this kind of operation is this correct and if so is this forever or just during recovery.
Also very occasionally I wear a heal about 2.5 inches if I go to a function or have a meal out I only have them On for about 4 hours so would this still be possible after a partial knee replacement?
Finally am I right in thinking that have a partial knee replacement leads to a full replacement within a couple of years?
Any information would be greatly accepted.

"Just got back from the doctor. He’s been running for 35 years. He took 4 x rays. Where I’m getting the pain is the spot where there is the most arthritis, medial right knee.  He feels that because it took 4 months to recover from meniscus surgery last year,  most likely my pain wasn’t from the meniscus, it was from aggravating the arthritis.  The meniscus tear was most  likely secondary.  So, he did a thorough exam. My quads are very tight which is pulling on my knee cap. My hips are very weak.  He wants me to do 4 weeks of Pt that specifically addresses these areas.  If I have no pain running, I can keep running. If I have pain, stop. Then I need to evaluate whether or not I need to permanently stop.  
Anybody have any info on this.  I really don’t want to stop jogging.

"So a few days ago, I did something really stupid by twisting my leg. My foot stayed straight on the ground while my entire right leg shifted towards the left in a awkward motion. It hurt like crap! I fell to the ground and started screaming (yes it hurt that much!) and about 2 mintues went by when I had the courage to stand up. It stopped hurting but everything still felt a bit weird. I think I twisted my ankle a bit because the first 30 mintues after the incident, pain from my ankle was the only thing I felt.
Fast forward to today: I can walk without any terrible pain, but my knee feels a bit wobbly....unstable I should say. Muscle spasms are prominent all throughout my leg. When I bend my knee, I hear these grinding/crackly noises. Also, I feel a sharp pain if I make the same movement I did during that incident (twisting my leg). When I feel my left knee and compare it to my right knee, something seems a bit off. My right knee (the knee that is giving me trouble) feels somewhat dislocated? It doesnt seem as smooth as my left knee. It feels as if theres a lump...or my bone seems a bit more sharper and is standing up a bit more. Poking out I should say. It isnt noticable if you look at it, but as I felt around, it felt unusual.
I am going to see the doctor tomorrow but I cant help but search up every little thing. Is it a torn meniscus? A dislocated bone? Ugh, I just want to know! Has anyone experienced similar symptoms? Just curious.

"I am due to have a knee replacement in about 6 weeks time.  A couple of months ago I started taking turmeric with black pepper capsules on the recommendation of a friend.  I didn't hold out much hope for them but they seem to be working miracles!
?I couldn't walk down hills or steps without awful pain but since taking the turmeric, although I still have stiffness, the pain is much less and I can walk much further. 
I still intend to have the operation as I have seen my X rays and I know I am bone on bone in two places but I'm wondering whether taking these capsules after the TKR will speed up my recovery.  
Does anyone have experience of this?

"I had a left total knee replacement 11 weeks ago. I spent 7 days in hospital whilst everyone else with the same op went home after 3 or 4 and seemed to sail through those first few days. I had a lot of swelling and a lot of pain. I still need to take OxyContin twice a day.  I can’t bend my knee past 60 degrees and still need a crutch to aid my walking. I do all of the excercises I should. 
The things that concern me are 1) I haven’t had my 6 week post op check with the surgeon yet. I rang the hospital about this to be told my name is in the book but there are too many patients and not enough appts and 2) I haven’t had any physio yet. I also queried this to be told not enough appts available and to just wait. I just feel like I’ve had my op and now I’m on my own doing the best I can but it doesn’t seem enough. It seems like the opportunity for maximum recovery has been missed. Anyone else In the same situation?

"Three years after the TKR operation. Stiffness and pain are the main issues. But,  at age 69 running is anyhow out of the question. Standing not recommended. Walking short distances, only.  Limited extension/flexion means limping.  However, driving works beautifully since my successful cataract operation ( new bi-focal lenses).  Automatic transmission, of course. If you really need to step walk and stand around the option is  ""revision, "" i.e., big operation with a new implant and all the associated risks. The pain problem.  If you really need to walk and stand a lot take 50 mg Tramadol with strong coffee No Sugar! (control your weight!).  Otherwise, half a capsule = 25 mg will do. Or try without, i.e., Aspirin or Paracetamol.  Or if you're a diehard no medicine just bear the limp and the pain. And consider a revision - with all associated risks.

"i had LTKR 18 months ago. I got 90% thru PT and hubby had back surgery and could not quite complete. I am age 70, was not real active since I had a bad fall and tore meniscus and cartilage on an already arthritic knee. I needed left hip replacement too, got the knee to the best point I could at 1 year and pain was gone even though stiffness remained.  Had Left Hip Replacement at 14 months after knee. Now my knee hurts again! I thought replacing it would get rid of the pain but walking feels like the metal is pushing into my shin and gets painful quick. I cannot take NSAIDS, no longer have pain meds and have tried TENS unit, Quell unit, nothing helps. I have to get this knee better as Ineed the other knee done in 6 months, doctor wanted to wait a year after hip replacement. My hip does not hurt but the 2 surgeries on my left side and a bad knee and thin cartilage on my right hip has caused a leg difference, so walking is difficult and my gait is bad. It’s only about ½” but it feels very weird. I bought shoe lifts but they make my right foot raised in back and my left not. I still feel as if I am walking crooked. The surgeon checked the pelvic measurements and they are spot on, it has to be the loss of cartilage on the right side. The left is fixed and back to normal but right is not. I didn’t notice the difference with my left knee replacement, although a slight difference might have been there as knee was still stiff. I noticed it immediately after the left hip though and left hip is not stiff or painful. I am hoping having my painful osteoporosis-arthritic right knee replaced will help the difference some. The problem is my right hip although showing very little cartilage in x-ray is not yet painful in any way. Anyway I am lop-sided. If I could have had right knee done, then left hip, I think I might have been okay, but the fall required I do the left first. I am trying to manage and get off the cane I have been using but with my walking issue it’s impossible. Has anyone had this issue and what can I expect? Right now depressed as I am handicapped and I was not before my fall and subsequent surgeries. Any ideas?

"Hello everyone,
My MRI and X-ray results said I have severe patellofemoral arthritis and mild medial joint line arthritis in my right knee, as well as a lose kneecap. 
The specialist told me I'd need a full knee replacement but as I was 47 years old it would be best delay it.  So I had a cortisone injection that didn't work.  I've just been back to the specialist and he is now saying I'm too young to have a partial knee op (yes it changed to a partial), so he's not prepared to do it yet.  He's decided to do an arthroscopy to look inside and see if he can delay things. 
I've got pain walking, bending, kneeling etc etc.  I'm really upset that my age has gone against me when I'm approaching 50 years old.  Has anyone had to wait for a knee replacement Because they were 'too young'?  I've looked into severe patellofemoral arthritis and it sounds like it needs sorting out asap, does anyone agree?

"I am 3 month and 1 week after my TKR on my right knee.  however, I still have a lot of pain when i walk.  My bend is 100 and extension is -7.    Therefore i am limping which causes pain to the other leg and also hip.   I feel worse than i did before the surgery, while  most posts i have read suggest that by the 3rd month i should feel good about having had the surgery.    I am going to PT 2 or 3 times a week and also doing regular exercises.  Am feeling very discouraged.  when i sent to my surgeon last week, he says pain and limping is quite normal for 3 months and that if it lasts for 9 months he would do a manipulation.  This seems an awful long time to be in pain.
Any advise would be appreciated.

"Hi! I am a 55 years old physically very active female.
I ended up staying at hospital for 1 week for a total knee replacement surgery due to low blood pressure and blood clots. At the first post -op appointment my Dr. put me an imovilaizer due to an infection. I was immobilized and had to elevate my leg for 10 daysatvhome  so I was not able to start my PT until almost 3 weeks post -op. 
Now that my scar tissues are forming and my entire leg is stiff. I have a private PT twice a week ( I still cry for pain.) and I do a set of exercise recommended by a physical therapy 3 times a day. My ROM is 77 degree as of 5 and half weeks post-op. My extension of knee is 0 to 1 degree. I have been taking Oxycodene, Tylenol, Canabis with CBD, and started acupuncture this week to control my pain. 
I was feeling so terrified about a manipulation and did some research which led me to this site. I have read all the entries here and gained knowledge about a manipulation and some positive and negative experiences from everyone and I feel more scared than ever. I am scared what if my knee never regain a full range of motion, I am scared about a manipulation with possible more pain and swelling I have to deal with, and I am scared that fact sometimes you may have to have more than one manipulation... When and how doctor or myself determine to have a manipulation that is my question. This whole thing about complications, delayed PT, severe pain even 6 weeks post-op, and low ROM is so unexpected.... 
Appreciate any more suggestions and encouragement. Thank you!

"Hi! I'm a female teenager with long legs and bad knees.
For a while now I've been experiencing pain in both my knees. It's kind of mild achy an crampy and I feel it when I move the joints. This only happens once or twice a day. One of my knees pops when I bend it.
What worries me, though, is my other knee. It's been deformed for a while now. I can feel that the bone on the side of my kneecap is much larger than the same bone on my other knee. It's as if there could be a lump ob top of that knee. Other than the aches happening slightly more often in that area, it isn't really different from the other knee except for the lump of course.
I've been reading on the internet and I found out that people with Osteosarcoma may experience these symptoms. If anyone knows anything else it could be, please tell. If you're positive it's Osteosarcoma, do you have any advice on how I can tell my parents about this? I'm scared.

"Ok so at PT could really only get to 110 basically on my own. They really wanted 120 even if it meant PT pushing. But I felt too nervous today to do that. PT says to me I should have been at 120 at 4 weeks. I cannot even begin to tell you how bad that makes me feel about my progress. I feel like a failure. Like something is wrong with me. I did get 120 last week when aid pushed foot. I was so reactionary I ended up grabbing his arm afterwards. 
I guess i have a mental block when it comes to getting the measurement they need me to be at. Any ideas how to cope with this? I need to get ready for more of this by Thursday. 
I am teying NOT to sink into despair 
Thanks

"I just got this from the radiologist and I have to wait a week before I meet with a Doctor. This is the report.
Recent lateral patellar dislocation with subsequent reduction. As a result there is an incomplete fracture lateral side of the distal femur, bone contusion of the medial side of the patella, partial thickness tearing medial patellar retinaculum. There are also small areas of tearing involving the vastus lateralis muscle and probably contusion of part of the semimembranosus muscle.
Tiny radial tear of the inner margin of the body of the lateral meniscus.
This injury occurred ten days ago and I have almost no pain whatsoever. My knee is still pretty swollen and its been in a wrap that holds it completely straight since day 1. 
The knee cap appears to be about in place but swelling makes it difficult to tell. Does anyone know what my prognosis is and if I will need surgery?

"On thursday it will be six weeks since my surgery on my right knee, I had arthroscopic surgery to prevent my knee cap from dislocating. Anyways,  I'm having a hard time regaining muscle mass especially around the era right above the knee on the left side of my thigh. I go to therapy twice a week, I do my  exercise everyday, I take walks around the block, and I also use a exercise bike...and the muscle is still really week. Like my therapist says that I lost almost all of it on that side. My doctor said my leg looks like the leg of a person who has not used their leg in 5 weeks and that he might have to do another surgery if I don't get better within the next few weeks. My therapist said she is worried that if I can't regain it soon that I won't be able to walk normally again, this obviously stressing me out... I suppose I can do my  exercises even more often but i still don't get why my muscle isn't even a little bit stronger when I have been doing my exercises. Like the first 2 weeks I didn't do them that often cuz I was still in a lot of pain but the past few weeks I have. Part of me thinks it could be the brace cuz where my muscle looks the weakest the brace indented around there. I'm not sure but I obviously want to be able to walk normally eventually so to be told I might have permanent damage if I don't correct it soon is scary. Or my doctor saying it looks like I don't use my leg at all when I've been doing exercise everyday and that I might need more surgery is really worrying me....
I know I'm taking longer to heal than most patients like I can only bend my knee about 70 degrees but I assume it's because my surgery was kinda complicated. Like my doctor said when he did mine, it was the worse case he's seen so far with people with my condition. So it seems natural that I would heal slower so I'm not as worried about bending my knee at the same pace as other people but I can't help but feel worried about the muscle mass issue...

"I'm due to have my right knee resurfaced in 6 weeks time.  From what I understand this is pretty much the same as a replacement except I will keep my ligaments and it is often used on younger people as they can be more active afterwards.
?I've been reading up on recovery times and am getting quite confused.  When my husband has his knee replaced a few years ago he was repeatedly told to exercise it every day after the op, even if there was pain, or otherwise scar tissue would set in and he would be unable to ever bend it properly again.  He followed this advice and has had a very successful outcome.
?However I am now reading that you should not exercise through pain but stop and rest, elevate and ice the leg.  Not sure which way to go as I obviously want a successful outcome too.

"Hello,
I am writing this in hopes that someone could please tell me what's wrong. Let me give you all the background possible and the symptoms.
I have experienced mild knee pain that prohibits me from doing exercise or climbing stairs for 6 months now. The problem first occurred while I was in the gym, using the leg press machine. The weight was not big at all, and upon doing some repetitions, this mild nagging pain appeared.
The pain reappears whenever I go up stairs, and when I sit in a car for a longer period of time. Also if I try doing any exercise with my legs. Sometimes the pain appears on its own, and nothing helps to relieve it. I have tried ice packs, resting, stretching, you name it. The pain itself is always mild and never strong and sharp.
Now the biggest mystery is that the pain is ALWAYS in both knees, and it hasn't healed for 6 months straight. Everything that I have read regarding knee pain, be it tendinitis, ligament sprain, the recovery period is less than 6 months for sure.
I am a female, 27 years of age, so I don't believe that the joint cartilage has worn out either.
Now let me explain where the pain is- it is right above and around the kneecap, there are something like small tight ligaments that seem to connect from the quad muscle to the knee, they are the ones that mainly hurt. Also, I believe that there are these small ligaments going above the kneecap itself, that also hurt.
My main problem regarding this health issue, is that I am in a foreign country where healthcare is incredibly expensive, and the doctors don't know english very well. I have gone to the doctor for other types of problems, and I always go home without a solid solution just because the doctors don't speak a lot of english and prefer to say ""rest"" rather than tell me what's going on. 
I apologize for the long topic, but I hope you'll understand my issue. I would happily go to a doctor if you guys tell me exactly what to look for and how to practically self-diagnose my condition using hospital equipment.
My main point of distress is that if it isn't a joint cartilage problem, everything else would have healed in 6 months, but my symptoms don't have anything in common with a joint cartilage problem. 
Thank you in advance!

"Hi: so my patella is very worn and there is some area of bone contact. I 'may have spurs, etc. I have not had an MRI because my doctors don't think that it will reveal anything. I do pass all of the office tests well--i.e. they flex and twist my knee without my having pain. But steroid shots have stopped working. At the moment I can't bear weight for long (walking) without pain increasing significantly. I am about to begin taking a strong ibuprofen to attempt to help the so called arthritis, which I just discovered is a catch all term that covers just about everything. Doctors advise against any surgery, even arthoscopic, saying they aren't effective. The cynic in me wonders if this isn't a cost decision but I doubt that. I finally wrested a promise of getting an mri if after a month my pain doesn't subside. I'm in the states with Kaiser; which seem to have a hands off approach to things like a torn miniscus (sp,) which I think I experienced over a year ago when my troubles began. Just let it heal.
I've done physical therapy and will continue, but I'm very discouraged. I'm not overweight. I can't go for walks right now however. 
I'm venting but also asking for any direction. I'm hoping the ibuprofen will help and I will at least be able to walk for forty minutes as a minimum.

"Hi again. I am currently 5 months post right TKR & afraid I’m slipping backwards. After a very rough 3 months, including a successful MUA I was finally doing great. I had/have excellent ROM & was practically pain free. I was walking several blocks (nothing too much) & going downstairs easily. Unfortunately that only lasted a couple of weeks. I then started experiencing pain and it’s gotten progressively worse. My ROM is still excellent & I don’t have pain when I’m at rest or doing daily light chores, but I can barely walk a block without a lot of pain now. The pain is specifically to the right of the kneecap (where the 2 parts meet). 
I’m getting depressed since I was starting to feel like things were finally going in the right direction & I could start planning a vacation & now that seems out of the question. Wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar. Thank you.

Fully able to enjoy all physical activities, with the exception of those that require running, jumping, or quick lateral movements. Stair climbing especially multiple flights are still challenging but doable. Kneeling will always feel strange, but that's OK. Routines followed which aided in my recovery were: proper nutrition and body weight; daily exercise (especially the days, you want to avoid it); sufficient rest/sleep, and, a can do attitude. Never, ever quit. Best wishes and the Lord's blessing to my fellow TRK classmates on your journey to good health and pain free living.

What i have noticed is that when i contract my quads they fire in a different sequence on my right leg to my (good) left one. It seems the VMO fires before the rest and then the other muscles take over and pull my kneecap laterally.  I have took a video to show you below.
Could this be causing the Chondromalacia Patella & how can i fix this?

"We all know that this is one of the best exercises to both straighten out your leg and increase the bend.  Tips:
- Your worst enemy is friction...  Gotta have a surface and something on your foot that will slide easily with as little friction as possible.  Silk or sil-like sheets are great if your doing this in bed watching TV.  On the floor, any plastic chair mat (the ones for your desk chair at the computer), thin plastic sheet (like those cheap ones for the snow), or anything else that slides easily will do.  Put a plastic bag with a rubber band over your foot to make it slide better.  
- Maximize your exercise for zero degrees...  To get your knee cloer to zero degrees, extend it as far as you can then put a 2-pound anke weight on the knee.  Just this slight extra pressure will pay off when you go to PT.  Not sure if I'd do this right after surgery...wait until you see your doc and have the staples removed.  But once you are doing full-on PT work, this helps a lot.  Just let the weight sit there as long as you can stand it...then back off and ice.
- Maximize your exercise for 120 degrees...  When you bend your knee, it's really hard to keep it bent and even push it to the next degree.  Just put a belt around your ankle and hold on with both hands.  Bend as far as you can and use the belt to hold it where it is.  When comfortable, give the belt a slight tug to bend just a fraction more.  Don't yank on the darn thing!  This is not a race.  Slow and easy...one degree at a time.
- A GREAT aid...  I got rid of all the friction problems with a device called a Knee-Flex...
It's a set of frictionless wooden rails with a heel cup between them.  Use this in bed, on the floor, in a pool, wherever.  It completely eliminates the friction problem and makes the exercise much easier.  Mine was actually from a different company and there are many ""brands"" of these devices around.  I just happened to grab this one off the web but you get the picture.
So...  No friction, add some weight, pull on the belt.  DON'T OVERDO IT but push it a bit to keep progressing.  Everyone has to find their own ""sweet spot"".  And always ice afterwards...
Hope this helps.

My right knee is scheduled to be done in Jan 2018, no cartridge , severe pain, keeps collapsing and locking and currently can't stand any weight. My new left knee has had three episodes of severe ripping pain at the back and side and down the calf. It gives way when it does this and the pain lasts for weeks. 
I saw my consultant yesterday who thinks it's arthofibrosis and the pain is scar tissue ripping. My knee has always been swollen and stiff and I have spent a small fortune on private physio and go to the gym/ pool every other day. I am totally committed to improving. 
I am so down and can't walk on either knee at the moment. I was back at work (teacher) but can't even get in the shower at the moment. Consultant has suggested this may happen with next knee too. What do I do? Have the other knee op and the manipulation as suggested ( told it may have little impact now) or live in constant pain and on sticks at 51? 
I am so fed up, I know this is at least a 12 month process but I feel back to stage 1 but worse.

"Hi. I am new on here. I had a TKR on 8th Sept 17. I have been doing very well with all my physio. Today out of the blue my knee became very stiff and I am unable to weight bare. The muscle has tightened above and to the side of my. I am unable to bend it. I am seeing my consultant in the morning but I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience. It's as if I have sprained or twisted it. Is this a common thing. Daphne

"I have had pain in my right knee for years. It is progressively getting worse. I saw the Dr as my knee was locking randomly. The pain was moderate and bad at times. PT made it worse. The steroid injection did not help at all. The Dr said he thought maybe a tear in the meniscus or the bone needing ""sanding"". He scheduled an arthroscope for next month. The past week it hasn't hurt nearly like it was and hasn't locked in a month. Should I cancel? Am I just ""kicking the can down the road"" so to speak if I do? Don't want unnecessary surgery, but on the plus side, I'd like to get rid of the pain AND my deductible has already been met for the year. Advice?
thanks

"Hi I'm on day 5 after having a partial knee replacement I'm 50. I had a spinal for the op and I have back ache and hip ache on the side of the operation. Is this from the chiselling and pulling during the op or the spinal I had. Also I'm doing quite well as only using one crutch when really achy. Also if someone could tell me the most comfortable position to sleep in as I curl up on my side normally so I'm having pain bending the knee so trying to sleep. On my back and it isn't working for me.

"It will be a year for my L. TKR on Oct. 19th and I still have issues. Since no cement was used in my implants, the bone has to fill in to stabilize the bone/implant. My bend is 120/125 and straight-0. My concern is when I set at the computer at a 90 degree angle, my tibia feels sore/aches down to the calf. When I get up, I have to get my footing, limp for a minute or two until I get moving; same when resting. It is as if I feel the implant going down my tibia, a soreness. Just an occasional ES Tylenol helps. I'm aware of the implant when I rest or sit. Will it ever feel normal again? I do not want to see my ortho, because I do not ever plan on another TKR!!! I might someday have to get an x-ray just to see how things healed/are healing.
So tired of doctors. Expecting more.....kinda wished I had not had the TKR. Still do my exercises ever so often.

"I’m about 5 weeks post TKR #1. TKR #2 will be on 10/27.
I’ve had ups and downs. I’m doing a bit better as time goes on.
Until yesterday. I’ve had the curve ball thrown at me of a return of a condition I had about a year ago - BPPV (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). It is really discouraging to be trying so hard to walk after TKR let alone doing it while the room spins and you bounce off walls. 
Fortunately for me, our area has a PT who only treats dizziness patients. He rid me of my BPPV once before and I’m hoping for a quick rebound again. 
I am not going to lie - I’m discouraged and concerned. Hoping for a quick and positive outcome. And wondering about whether to postpone TKR #2 if I don’t respond to treatment quickly. Not sure going into another surgery with that issue added is a great idea.

The pain is there so I will now take full pill prior to PT where I was taking 1/2 before. I feel like a failure or that maybe there is something wrong with me and I find that terrifying as I don't want to go back to have surgery again. Is this normal? Any suggestions?

"Well it’s been a little over 2 weeks since my PKR, patella femoral compartment.  ROM is very good, Pain is so, so. PT person says I’m doing really well, so well I’m fact he keeps adding in harder and harder exercises.  I understand but thinking he shouldn’t do so much one day that I can hardly walk the next; one day this week my knee looked like a balloon and was swollen down to my toes.  Took a whole day to get that under control.  Going forward I am going to tell my PT guy to slow down but I’m paying him and it is my recovery and he is working/getting paid by me!
Still thinking I am way ahead only being 2 weeks out.  Lots of rambling here but just wanting to know if this experience is similar to what it should be at this point?

"Knee clearly popped in dirtbike crash, was swollen for a week after.  Went to doctors and they said MCL and Meniscus could be damaged, strained, or torn.  They didn't say much more other than to get an MRI, which I don't exactly want to do ($700) if its just going to confirm I have a tear in my mcl and that I need to wear a brace and let it recover for a couple months.  Its feeling better two weeks after it happened, I can walk fine, my main question is though, does the ""pop"" confirm that it did in fact tear? or is that not a good enough reason to assume it has a tear without an mri.  Kindof just want an explaination and to be able to say what happened without paying for the MRI which I don't see necessary, going to be getting a brace.  I just haven't seen whether or not the pop actually means something, or if it could pop and just be sprained.  The doctor didn't give me a very clear conclusion and just said to come back after an MRI. Thanks!

"I never had problem like this with my right TKR.  My left knee is still twice the size of my right and I could fry an egg on it at night.  I get lightning, stabbing pains out of the blue on the outside and (thanks to Google) I think the sweet spot is somewhere on my lateral gastrocnemius tendon.  My leg extension is still really poor, nowhere near flat, and I can still only do about 90 degrees at best.  Saw the surgeon's clinician two weeks ago and she thought all was ok but fixed for me to see the organ grinder early November.  I'm thinking of contacting him for a private consultation as I can't deal with this much longer and I'm beginning to worry about my employers' taking a dim view of the prolonged absence, particularly as I was back after 6 weeks last time.  I thought it strange not to be given ibuprofen either in hospital or to take home.  That at least has had some positive effect.

"Hi Administrator,
I seem to be joining a group of people who are having problems with the box "" GO TO DISCUSSION"" !
I am unsure if you have made changes to your website and the way it presents online or whether there are more complex issues involving browsers. either way as it stands it is useless.
If the discussion theme cuts short and the only recourse is to click on the GO TO BOX and it won't do anything but (in WIN 10 anyway) give an error message .... Hmmmm! cannot reach this page then its nopt much use being on Patient UK.
The main feature as far as it can see is that when I get this error message the GO TO DISSCUSSION BOX is on the left of the post.
If I go back prior to 30 Sept that same box is in the middle of the post - no problems with that.
Can you please take this up with your IT people .... I'm sure its a problem with you guys and not any browser I use or with WIN 10.

Had my knee replaced 13th September swelling and bruising was pretty bad but more or less what I expected.
Had appointment to have clips removed but unfortunately they are not ready to be removed yet so got to wait another 4 days then go back.
More bruising seems to be coming out around the clips and more swelling. Skin feels so tight and a sort of a burning pain. Is this normal for this stage of the recovery?
Sleep is impossible as I feel I need to move my leg every 5-10 minutes to try and relieve what I can only describe as a cramp type feeling.
I don't want to bother the Dr if others of you on this forumhave had similar experience but I don't really know what's to be expected.
So tired I could sit and cry plus I've now come down with a streaming cold to add to it all.

As I mentioned in my last post at 9 months post TKR my orthopedic surgeon told me that there is nothing else he can do for me because I developed adhesions/scar tissue and now is too late to do anything other than to order a JAS Knee Brace to help with the knee bend. I could only bend it to between 105-110 the most. There are a couple of TKR patients in the forum that are using the JAS brace. If you read this post please (or anyone else) that are using the brace can you please let me know how are you doing and did the brace helped you. My brace was ordered on July 31, 2017 and I still don't have it. Is sitting at the representatives office and it has not been delivered.  Yes, I do my exercises everyday day and I go to the gym every other day. I also had 50 sessions of PT. I ice, elevated my leg, etc.  I know that it could take up to 18 months, but I should at least feel a little relief from the pain. I could walk, however, cannot bend the knee.

"RTKR back in March has been a tough journey pain wise and slow - needed MUA at 10 weeks to break scar tissue and enable bending. That helped a lot. I have made some slow but steady progress since, though knee is still swelling a bit and feels tighter and achy after walking any distance. Today, after just a 10 minute walk, it feels super tight like a vice around knee cap and very sore if lightly pressed in a few areas, as if bruised. Not red or hot at all. The only change otherwise is that some of the numbness I had is wearing off with odd nerve sensations firing off sometimes- as though cold water running down leg, or pins and needles etc. But only occasional.
I have no upcoming appts with the hospital or anyone else now - I will make one if it does not improve. I know it is still early days, but seems unusual in the groups I chat in to have much pain at this stage, everyone is saying how great to be pain free-  and I seemed to have greater pain than average all through, not helped by being intolerant of most pain meds! I know there are some who have lots of trouble from their TKR too, I appreciate how far I have come and I don't think I overdo things, I try to be sensible etc. But it is starting to get me down as I have been unable to take another job due to various health problems over a couple of years and this too.
Now other knee OA is getting worse but I could not face that one being done as the first one has not got to being better than how I was pre op - different issues of course, but not better though I am trying to stay positive and reserve final judging until past a year. The doc just suggest painkillers but they do very little to help and don't agree with me - I've just applied the gel though.

I cannot stand for too long or walk for too long because it is too painful. I begin to get a popping sensation in my knee. I can’t bend my knee for too long or straighten it for too long
I have now been referred for physio but I have had this before and I’m not sure it will help. I am now 22 years old and I’m clutching at straws.
Does anybody else have these symptoms that could help? 
Thank you

"Hi! I'm a 14 year old girl and I recently noticed that one of my knees looks deformed when I bend it. It seems larger. Again, this is only when I bend it.
I've felt that knee as well. The bone feels the same as on my other knee, but larger.
The knee also hurts a bit when I walk on it. It's just very weak pain and it doesn't bother me at all. It comes and goes and only lasts for a few seconds. I also experience this pain in other parts of the leg and sometimes in my other leg. My other knee snaps when I climb the stairs.
Do I really need to worry or am I overreacting? For the last week or so I've been worried that there might be a tumor in my deformed knee.....

I have to do 10-20 minutes every hour or so!  I am in so much pain when I do them. I am struggling to straighten my leg and my bend is about 80%. They couldn't understand why I was using crutches after a week (I should be using a stick!)  They have frightened me into thinking I won't get better if I don't exercise as they say. I am quite young to have had this op, is this why they are harsh with me?  Can anybody recommend some bending exercises that are not as painful. Thank you

" It's just about eight weeks since my total knee replacement. I still don't sleep very well at night though it is better. My problem is the scar tissue I can bend my knee to chest about 95° which I think is pretty good since the nerve block put me a week behind as i could not do the exercises well.  I go to pool therapy twice a week which hurts like crazy but is working. I use my recumbent 10 minutes a day twice a day. Just started making it around. Every time I start out a day I feel like I'm starting all over again with scar tissue. If I watch a movie and get up  it's like starting all over again. Ripping tearing stretching it all hurts but I guess we have to keep doing it when will this end?  I don't want to have the  manipulation where they put you asleep in bend your knee!!!  I'm not even 60 thought I'd have more energy to do these exercises more strength or stamina and better pain tolerance but I've seen people older than me doing better than me. Very frustrating!

I am still unable to lift my leg straight but I should note that I haven't been able to do that for years as my knee was so bad that I wasn't using my right leg and the thigh muscle was very weak.

I will admit that it was very difficult at first and there were times that I wished for my time back. It was a long road to recovery but WOW! I have my life back. My knees no longer dictate what I can do.  There were so many times that I would have to say I couldn't do something because my knees wouldn't let me. Not any more!  
This group was very helpful when I was struggling and I want to thank everyone for the support that helped get me through. 
I hope my success story will offer some hope to those who are on the sometimes rough road to recovery or to those who are trying to decide whether they should have the surgery.

When discharged I was given Apixaban to thin the blood to prevent DVT, unfortunately, as I pushed myself to soon , this caused a secondary bleed, the pain of which I have never suffered anything like and ended up back in hospital for rest, ice and elevation.

"Back in June I injured my left knee after accidentally planting my foot on another player's foot. I felt a pop and was on the floor clutching my knee and a trainer quickly came to my aid he had me do some tests like running and cutting. He said he didn't think it was an ACL issue because the swelling wasn't severe and I was able to do some running, but advised me to see a dr if the pain continued.
   I woke up the next day in a lot of pain when walking and especially when bending my knee since it didn't bend fully. So I went to the dr and I was diagnosed with a knee sprain (I had a negative lachmans test and dr said it was not my ACL) and told to stop activity for 2 weeks. I also had an x ray which did not show any problems except knee effusion. After taking 3 weeks off I hurt it again shooting at a park. I didn't go to the dr again until after I felt it pop again at basketball practice while trying to shoot (was not running) this time a much minor pain but pain nonetheless. After a second visit the dr tested me again and was negative for the lachmans test and concluded once again it was not due to an ACL tear and advised me to do PT which I have been doing ever since.
   I just want another opinion bc I believe it could be more than just a sprain at this point and the dr never gave me an MRI so I am not quite sure exactly what is wrong. I want to clearly rule out an ACL as it would put an end to my season. I just want to get back into playing basketball as it is my senior year and last chance. It's been pain free for a while now and I am able to run lightly and do everything normal but I haven't done full speed sprints ever since and I am afraid to experience that pain again.

"Hi,
I was diagnosed with GBS in 1974, I now 55 years old. I had no fancy treatment, hospital for 4 months, walked again at 1 year, and endured 8 years of Occupational therapy and physical therapy. I was left with lower residual weakness, no calf muscles, ankles very weak. I did not see neurologist until I was in my early 50's. I was determined to go on, suck it up and live life. I had 2 daughters, no issues with pregnancy other than being careful of my stability in walking. Since the illness, I've never ran, step on tip toes or wear and high heels. I'm a boot girl to give me Support. I've been employed for 35 years at same company and feel very blessed! While I never felt defeated through the years, or I never let it definitely me until now. I walked on sides of my feet to compensate for muscles that never came back. I walked with gait and obvious limp. Through the years I noticed swelling in knee caps and pain when I over walked my legs. Just sore & tired legs and pain. Fatigued too. As of December 2016, my condition has deteriorated to the point where I had horrific pain in knee, right worst than left. 5 doctors later, EMK test, MRI, X-rays. The cartilage is basically non-existent, bone on bone and full of arthritis. I have to use cane, fall often and am very, very unstable. I guess my knees, quad muscles were my saving Grace all those years. After 42 years of walking , compensating weak muscles with stronger ones,, it took a toll on my knees. I will be getting gel injection next week. But probably new knee replacement in future, but will it work? I'll still have same legs, weak muscles...... I cannot afford to lose if it doesn't work. Any ideas or suggestions if anyone w/ GBS has similar delimina, I would love to hear, talk ,I need
Advice. Thanks in advance for your time and help in this matter. Sorry so long..

Before surgery my arthritic pain prevented kneeling (i love yoga) and I've been super stoked to be able to kneel again. But i still can't at this point without pain.
The pain however is stemming from my incision. It feels like I'm kneeling on broken glass. I'm guessing it's due to scar tissue? I was told early on to massage the scar to break up scar tissue, which i still do.
I am wondering if others experience this and if it changes at a certain point?

"I've been running fairly regularly for the last couple of years. Over the summer with holidays etc., I've been going out less often (2-3 times/week, instead of 4-5), but this has coincided with what I'm pretty sure is some ITBS (fairly constant pain on outside of right knee, particularly as it bends). When it's occurred I've rested until it's more than gone and have sometimes had respite, but it's ultimately eventually come back.
Where I wonder if there's a deeper issue, is that I have a bit of a funny hip. I also cycle, and over the years I've come off quite a few times, often landing hard on my right hip (I don't think I'm especially accident-prone, but it's probably happened once every couple of years or so). None of these has required hospitalisation, but sometimes it's been painful for a few days. A while back I noticed that my right hip sticks out compared with my left (I believe the bit concerned is the iliac crest?). I don't typically have any pain there, however it does feel odd. Having read that the ITB runs from the hip to the ankle, it's crossed my mind that maybe this could be a big part of the issue.
Interestingly I ran this morning for the first time in a couple of weeks (due to being away) and the ITBS is the worst I've experienced. Interestingly, just before going away I had one of my cycling falls and my hip was very achy for a few days, but has been fine for the best part of the week.
So I guess I'm wondering if the hip ""issue"" (if it is one?) could be a factor in the ITBS - either the cause or contributing to it being so much worse today?

I go back on Thursday to see my surgeon, it will be 7.5 weeks since the op.  I want to be able to speak honestly to him about my experience.
I have to say that without this forum I would have been lost.  It has been the best source of information for me.  I trust all of you as you have been through the same experience as me and we understand each other.  They do say 'A problem shared, is a problem halved'.  Too true I say.
Today I went into town with my daughter and 5 year old granddaughter.  Hitchin is an old market town with cobble streets and lots of steps up and down on and off pavements.  I went without a stick, big big regret.  I am almost 7 weeks post-TKR.  My leg was in agony and I couldn't wait to get home.  That was really depressing as I thought I was doing so much better.
This is a long slog and I just wish I had realised that fact.
good luck everyone.

"Hello,
I have been following this wonderful forum since I had my first TKR just 12 days ago. I am 71 years old and in pretty good health.  Many of my questions are the same as those already asked, which has helped.  But after doing everything I've been told to do I feel a bit like I'm not where I should be at this stage.  I know I'm in the early stages, but it is hard not knowing what to expect.
The first 4-5 days were so hard, I did as many of the exercises as I could, but all I wanted to do was rest.  These past 6 days I've tried to do more, but I am just so exhausted, stiff and sore.  I'm on Percocet 1 every 6 hours, I was on 1 every 4 hours, but, as many of you know, caused constipation.  Sleep deprivation is a constant and I'm afraid a bit of depression is affecting me.  I know I am early in my recuperation, but how did all of you handle the stresses of this difficult surgery?
I see my surgeon next week for my first visit since my surgery and I start OP physical therapy also.  The only PT I've been doing is what they gave me on my hospital instruction manual, which basically was pictures with how many times I was suppose to do them.
I thank the Lord everyday that I have a wonderful husband that has been so helpful and encouraging.  It's just that this is so new and I just don't know what to expect.
I would appreciate any wisdom that you could share with me to help me get through this.
Blessings

"I'm a 14 year old girl and a freshman in high school and ive been driven just about crazy with my knee issues. It's been happening since I was about 7 years old. My knee would randomly dislocate out of place and pop back before I could hit the ground. I've been left with numerous amounts of bruises and scrapes from falling but I didn't actually see a doctor until a good amount after it began. I have a history of bad knees in my family (the same thing apparently happened to my dad) but he said that he had ""grew out of it"" by doing exercise. Once I saw the doctor, a couple years ago, they told me the two options that most people were presented with- knee surgery or physical therapy. Like most, my family and I wanted to try physical therapy. After going there for a good amount of time by knees became better and the dislocation happened very rarely if any at all. It was great and my parents and my therapist believed I could stop sessions and go home, trying exercises by myself. Of course, life got in the way and I didn't have time to exercise as much as I'd like so my knee problems began to gradually come back. After two TERRIBLE years of dealing with it, I began therapy once again, having the same results. Around 2 months in, my therapist straight up asked me what I was still doing there considering my knee hadn't dislocated in a while. I had to stop sessions AGAIN and now I'm currently living almost a year without doing therapy. I faced many PE running days with embarrassment as I'd just fall out of nowhere and people wouldn't understand that I was actually hurt each time it happened. I really felt like I had to vent because it happened to me today when walking home from school and I'm so incredibly p****d off because no one close to me, including my family understands what I'm going through. After today's incident I truly had a mental breakdown and I just want to tell others who face this that they're not alone. This probably sounds very cheesy but it's the truth. I really hope that through lots of exercise and strengthening- physically and mentally- I'll be able to overcome this and not let it define me and the things that I do.

"Hi, could anyone advise me about a problem that my mother is experiencing after her tkr surgery please?  She's nearly 83 and had her operation three weeks ago tomorrow.  I know that it's early days but I am worried about a new symptom that she is experiencing.  I hope that it's normal and others have knowledge of this problem, but I have not been able to identify it on the internet.    Approximately 4"" from the top of her leg, down to just above her knee (a band of approximately 8*), she is experiencing a tight feeling like a tourniquet or a heavy clamp.   Otherwise, everything seems to be reasonably normal for a tkr - hot knee, swelling, stiffness, lots of pain (sometimes seeming to improve and then returning with a vengeance).  Last night and today, the knee has been causing a lot of pain.  From reading other posts this might be to be expected, but I am concerned in case this, combined with this new feeing in her thigh / upper leg, is a symptom of something more sinister.  Any advice would be appreciated please.  Thank you!

"I found this article on internet, and I thought it was interesting . . Researchers have looked through large databases of Medicare patients who have undergone knee replacement surgery. They were able to compare patients who had a cortisone shot (or viscosupplement injection) prior to replacement, and if that individual had an infection after replacement. The data clearly demonstrated there was a higher chance of having an infection in people who had a shot before surgery.
Furthermore, the research found that the risk of infection after surgery was strongly correlated with how soon before surgery patients had their most recent shot. If the shot was within seven months of the time of surgery the risk of complication was significantly higher.
I have never heard this before, and I think it's probably quite likely that someone after having an unsuccessful cortison injection would decide to go on for the TKR . . .

"Long story short. 
2015, suffered a root tear of my meniscus. Had it surgically repaired.
 In October 2016, I was skating and felt a pop in same knee. Figured I did it again, and fought through it. Noticed I couldn't push off the leg going up steps. About 4 weeks ago, I was at the gym, and noticed my knee was clicking when I was doing elliptical work. Then one day at home, I turned awkwardly, and felt a pop and searing pain in the same spot, and couldn't put weight on it. So I grabbed my brace and started to wear it again. Made an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon. Saw him Tuesday. He said I more than likely retore the meniscus. He then asked if I did any ACL damage when I tore the meniscus the first time. Told him the doctor didn't say I did. So he wants me to have an MRI done, and under diagnosis, it says ""acute medical meniscus tear; acute knee pain; (and wasn't expecting this) New ACL tear. 
Is it possible to tear the ACL and still be able to walk (albeit with a limp and pain)? I can't push off the leg and have all my weight when going up stairs.

"Hi this is my first time on this website. I just turned 42. My knees have dislocated since the age of 12. My right knee has been through a lot of surgeries. I just had a torn meniscus fixed last Sept. My knee got worse. I now have some AVN. Known as (bone death). I got terminated from my job because of job restrictions. I am now at stage 4 with osteoarthritis. Stage 2 with osteonecrosis the bone death. I wear a brace non stop. Just today when I lifted my knee to turn it locked up. It is very scary not knowing if it is going to crumble if I put weight back down on it. It feels like it's not attached and stuck and daily my knee burns,swells,aches and has stabbing pain. My treictular groove is very damaged under the knee cap. My doctor does not want to give me a new knee yet which mentally I am not ready. Please if anyone has anything similar I would really like to hear from you . I feel alone with my daily struggles and I don't ever want my little girl to worry. Thank you everyone. Jen.

"Hi everyone 
Well today I am 8 weeks after partial knee replacement. It hasn't been easy but then who's is. I have been told to walk half mile every day working up to a mile. Along with still doing my exercises I am doing the walking however,  I have been troubled with pain when walking so resorted to using a cane/walking stick as told by my physio.  For the past week my shoulders and collar bone are hurting- a lot! Especially when using a rail to walk up and down my stairs. I am wondering if it is the stick and if anyone else has had a similar problem.  Any advice would be appreciated. I have tried playing around with the height of the cane but can't do anything about the stair rail.
my physio is on holiday so I can't ask what exercise i can do to relive the pain.
The upside is I walked almost two miles today (slowly! Taking almost 90 minutes) with my cane for knee support.
thanks

I just want to say it again...I am so grateful for this forum.  The honest and open dialogue is such a boost for me, feeling alone on this journey is a thing of the past.
I sit on the sidelines and read all of the comments here, each experience helps me to move forward in my recovery.
I am now 8 weeks out from TKR, and it certainly helps (and is also too bad) to read that others are still feeling pain, sleepless nights, numbness, etc.  Without this shared information my imagination would be reeling!  My doctor and PT just don't share ANY relevant healing information with me.  Thank you all for being so open and honest about your recovery.
Blessings on your recovery!

Managing on just paracetomol and ibuprofin - much less pain than I ever expected.  
The two needling areas are sleep, or lack of - which I expected and am dealing with.  You can never have too many pillows following a knee surgery!
And then, the tightness on my skin over my knee is intense.  Not only at the scar site, but the whole knee itself.
Has anyone found a way to help ease this and get the elasticity back?
I am using Bio Oil on the scare to help fade it.  But I wondered if there was anything people use for the tightness?

"Hi! Some 12 months ago I injured my knee cartilage (back of the knee) on my left knee due to a bad jogging technique. I could only bend my left leg back (heel towards butt) only 60 percent of the way. My right leg was perfectly fine. (With the heel touching the butt). If I sat down at a computer for an hour or so and got up my left leg would be sore when I started to walk. I would describe it as a sore and dull pain. 
I went and saw the orthopedic doctor. He did an x-ray and said no problem with the bone but the cartilage doesn't look so good. He suggested to stop jogging, complete rest, and gave me a pamplet with some exercises to do. I did that except I wasn't very good at doing my exercises regularly. 
12 months later after doing very little exercise, eating a healthy diet and some water fasting my left leg has improved. I can bend the left left (heel towards the butt) 85 percent of the way. There is not longer any pain when I sit at my computer desk for a long period. My question is what exercise is good to further heal my knee cartilage? I have a pamplet with exercises but I want to hear if anyone has tried something different and got good improvement. Cheers, Chris

"Twelve months ago, I was sobbing,talking to myself in the bathroom mirror,asking myself why on earth had I agreed to have a TKR. I wished I never had had it done.
My leg was so swollen, the pain was so bad and the exercises were almost impossible to do. Trying to bend a knee which was swollen to twice its size is not easy.
With lots of help from the brilliant advice on here I managed to cope.
After six weeks of weekly physio provided by our NHS here in the UK I was left to continue my knee journey alone. My doctors at my local surgery just distributed painkillers.They weren't really much help.
My biggest worry was the inability to do all the exercises because of the swelling. I decided to just do what I could when I could and keep icing. After six months I still had pain and could only bend to ninety degrees.The more I walked on my knee the more pain I had. 
The swelling had gone down quite a lot so I was able to do more knee bending exercises. My consultant was always there in the background if I needed him which I shall always be grateful for. He told me that he never discharged any his  patients whilst they still needed him. Our NHS is brilliant when it works.
A few weeks ago I started riding my bike( power assisted) again.Yes, I felt a few painful twinges in my knee as I pedalled but I felt good. 
As for walking, well I'm fine as long as I don't do too much. A couple of days ago I walked two miles up and down hills in our local country park. As I had not done that since my I had my new knee it did start to hurt.I think I overdid the hills.
The cycling did improve my knee bend so yes it can still improve twelve months down the line.
Am I glad I had a TKR?  Now I can say yes I am. My knee will always feel 'mechanical' but I can walk most of the time without pain.
Recovery after TKR is not the same for everyone, we recover at our own speed.
So to all those just starting their TKR journey all I can say is just hang in there, it does get easier. Don't be put off when you read that someone is back at work, running again and pain gone after a few months. They are the lucky ones how I wish my recovery had been as fast. 
The down side is that other knee has now started to 'go'. It is very painful at times but I really want to avoid another TKR but only time will tell.
PS I'm seventy eight years young.

"Patient: ""Hey Doc, it hurts when I do that.""
Doctor: ""Don't do that.""
- Henny Youngman, 1946
Sure, run to the doc, get some pills...WRONG!!!  Unless you're bleeding all over the floor and your body is screaming ""Get me to the ER"", there another way...under your complete control...
Think of yourself as a science experiment.  You have a dependent variable (the pain) and multiple independent variables (ex: walking, swimming, stress) that you know of.  In a controlled experiment, when all the independent variables are known, you remove them one by one to see the effect on the dependent variable (the pain)  In the example case, the easiest would be not swimming and walking on the same day and see what happens.
Another method would be to eliminate ALL the independent variables (stop everything) for a week or two, let your body achieve stasis and then add each one back into your routine to the point where the pain reappears, thereby defining the cause.
However, when one does not report the pain happening all the time, I would check two things:
1. Does the pain occur when ALL THREE factors occur simultaneously (ex: walking AND swimming on a stressful day)?  If yes, you found the combination that causes your pain.  Solution: take one of the elements out of the equation.  If not, this next example could be the case...
2, You have not identified all the complete set of independent variables in your pain equation.  In this case, there must be MORE to the story beyond our example of swimming, walking and stress.  The way to figure this out is to journal.  Write down everything you do, eat, drink, think etc. for a few weeks.  Suddenly you will see a pattern emerge, one which identifies either a single cause or the unique combination that results in your pain. Once done, change your routine to avoid the culprit(s)...then keep journaling to make sure you nailed it.  It's basic science 101: isolate the cause of the undesired result.  How do you think we got to the moon?  Same method.
Look forward to seeing everyone publish their results in the Lancet or JAMA.
PS: To make this work, you have to remove all emotion from the analysis.  You're a beaker in a lab and you're about to turn up the bunsen burner...  Do this right and you'll have your answer.  No docs, no drugs...just the truth.
And the truth is:  You'll be dealing with pain of one kind of another for the rest of your life.  Gonna run to the doc every time you feel a twitch or be your own doctor for a change.  Take control of your body and your life.  You'll be better off...

I understand recovery can be pretty painful but a relative recently blew my 'don't hurt' argument out of the water pointing out how limited I am just getting around (especially standing up/sitting down.  Plus my balance is waning and I am about to begin using a cane/trekker stick
I would appreciate any advice you can give me, either pro or con.

"Hi everyone in my TKR family.  I can't begin to thank you all enough for your support and encouragement throughout this journey.  Three months of sitting in a recliner in my bedroom...alone.  But not really alone because I had all of you.  I just wanted to share my update and maybe encourage someone in a similar situation.  After 11 weeks post op, after many tears and worries about my ROM, I had to return to work in my classroom filled with fourth graders.  I was at -8 (straightening) for a long time so I had to wear a brace which helped me get to a -6.  For over a month I was hovering around a -5/6.  But within two weeks of returning to work, today at pt, I was a -2 straighten and 126 bend.  I really think my improvement is related to moving, walking, standing, working, thinking of other things besides my ROM, and joining life again.  Yes, I'm really tired and achy at the end of the day, but I'm not limping any more!  YAHOO!!  Stepping out of that dark tunnel of recovery, is actually helping my recovery!  So don't despair if you are still sitting in your recliner...you are not alone.  And once you are well enough to step back into your life, I'm hoping you will see a light at the end of your tunnel, too!

"Hi everyone,  
My name is Jan and I am having my left knee replaced next month, total joint replacement.  I will also have the right one done but probably not until next year.
Can anyone share any adivce?  Tips?  Things you thought of after your operation that you wished you had thought of before the op?  Things to do in advance - or any shock surprises things you did not expect afterwards?  Good and bad?
How active are you in the first week or two?  Is it OK to rest with your leg up, and then do your exercises in between, or are you expected to be up moving all the time?     And how did you manage to sleep at night?  I read you are not meant to put a pillow under your knee.  How were you able to sleep comfortably?
Really, anything you can share would be helpful - even including the pain, good or bad - it just would help put my mind at ease a bit if i could know what to expect from those who have been through it.  It is probably not as bad as my imagination is. 
I am very nervous.  I broke both my knees when I was 19 (in 1979) and have had 9 or 10 surgeries since then - 4 or 5  just to fix them, and then more ti keep them ticking over and those ones were keyhole surgery which was a doddle - but I am remembering the pain I felt when the did the original ligament repairs and what not - the 4 or 5, they were very painful surgeries/recoveries - and I am very anxious remembering it - so anything to put my mind at ease is a good thing - even if it means knowing the cold hard truth!!  
So please - share away if you would - I would be so grateful.   
I should add I have become extremely sedentary - so have put weight on - and I know that will impede my recovery.

"Recently passed the 9 months TKR marker. To date, all has gone smoothly without any regrets about the surgery. Issues encountered at this point: have minor difficulty ascending and decending stairs, especially several consecutive flights; minor difficulty standing-up using the surgurical leg only from a kneeling position, loud popping noise, no pain; feel pressure on the knee when kneeling, but no pain; minor stiffness after a long period (a hour+) driving or sitting; continue using ice due to occassional minor swelling after strenous activities such as a hour of stationary biking or treadmill walking with 4% or 5% elevation. Other activities such as upper and lower body weight lifting and swiming have increased cardio endurance and strenghten legs. At 68 yo and retired, I am blessed to have a pain free and mobile life again. Best regards and the Lord's blessing to all fellow knee replacement graduates.

"On January 17, 2017 I had a meniscus tear.  PT and aquatic therapy did nothing to relieve pain.  Finally on May 25 I had arthroscopic meniscus surgery which showed a large tear and arthritis in the medial compartment of my knee. I didn't realize I had any arthritis because I was asymptomatic ... walking 4 to 5 miles several days a weeks.  
Started back on PT.  On Day 5 post surgery, I could walk without pain! It was a miracle! Day 8, after an aggressive PT visit, I had excruciating pain that hydrocodone didn't touch, which lasted for a several days.   
Now, 2.5 months later, pain is greatly diminished, but I can't walk more than four or five blocks without aggravating my knee and experiencing increased pain.  Knee is always swollen but not necessarily painful, unless I aggravate by walking too much. I get fatigued when I have to stand for any length of time.  
I'm scheduled for partial knee replacement on September 14.  Is there any advice you can give me that would prepare me for surgery?  I've been losing weight and I just started doing more exercises to increase quad strength.   
Anyone care to share your partial knee replacement story ... of recovery, I hope. :-)

I have done my physio prescribed exercises three times a day most days, walked a little and iced and elevated. I was doing ok and built up to a 700 yard walk. However 2 days ago my knee on the operated side started really hurting, i feel like i have gone backwards, even though I have still got a reasonable bend and almost staraight the pain is awful, I cant touch it. I am imagingin all sorts, it even feels like its not in the right place??? Has anyone else experienced this? I dont see the surgeon for another 2 weeks.

"Hi Everyone --
?Yesterday, July 31, I had my 9-month check up with my orthopedic surgeon.  I've been having problems with the bending, which most of you know and have answered my posts.  When I saw the surgeon in January 2017, he broached the idea of a manipulation or another 30 days of physical therapy.  I chose the physical therapy because it was less invasive.  Now, this is what the surgeon told me yesterday: "" I should have had the manipulation because my bend is only 105.""  Can't have it done now because I have developed adhesions/scar tissue and it is not advisabe to have one done at this late.  He said that he cannot scope it because the adhesions/scar tissue will grow back within a few days.  So bottom line -- there is not much that he can do and the pain might eventually go away. He told me to continue my exercise at home and the gym, especially on the bicycle.  I have pain everyday in the back and outer side of the right knee.  I still ice and rub my knee every night.  I know that many people have told me that the bend and pain will take up to 18 months.  I can deal with not being able to bend it to 120, but the pain is a different story.
?Anyone have any suggestions other than what I have mentioned.  At the present time I am very depressed.  Thank you.  J-21370

"On 2nd February  I had a TKR and patella resurfacing. The TKR was a complete success and I can walk without pain and within 10 days had a 110 degree bend. The physio didn't want to see me any more. The Consultant was thrilled by my progress at my 12 week check up as I strolled into his office without a limp. However, stairs are a completely different story and by the end of the day it is agony. I often have to crawl up them. Surprisingly, going down isn't quite as painful. I can feel my patella catching and clicking  when I bend the knee, as if it's not gliding properly. Please, does anyone else suffer with this pain using stairs and will it improve with time? Or, do I need to return to see the physio or Consultant for some strengthening exercises? Any advice would be much appreciated.

"Hello folks
I'm looking some help.
I have been trying to get more mobile so been walking a lot more and decided to give couch to 5k a try.
On the 4th day while jogging along I was getting sharp pain in both knees. I tried to push on but couldn't so I stopped and walked instead. A week later I have bad pain in both knees. When I walk. When I take stairs. When I sit down. When I stand up. The left knee is the worst. It feels unstable and there is a sharp pain roughly at the inside of the knee when I move. I have been following RICE treatment and it hasn't shifted. An initial google made me think that it was runners knee but as it's still on going a week later I'm wondering if it's something else. Any help or advice appreciated.

Something has been building up with one of the physios.  Early session I asked if I could please use the bike.  It wasn't a group activity - we all need to do the usual ""obstacle course"".  However, she allowed me to do it!
I'm flabbergasted - why?  Because today I again pleaded with her to do the bike again and she said yes.  Good start.  Did the obstacle course, used bigger weights with no problems, it's very obvious that I'm doing super well.
Where did I go wrong?  I dared to ask if I could use the treadmill! WOW.  I got told by her - oh no, I can't have you doing different things from the group!!
It was a foot away from the group in the same room for goodness sake!  I'm mad as hell.  What's wrong with these people who don't want to, or can't see the obvious!! Cos I still can't believe it!

Had 2nd TKR Sep 16 and had nothing but misery ever since... the pain was alot worse than the first (didn't think that possible) was on opiates have been off them for months now and just take Panadiene Forte x 2 twice daily to help with pain... it hardly take the edge off. 
My first one was getting good bend at 115% and has dropped to 110% .. my 2nd knee was as 110% and the surgeon didn't even tell me what it was last visit, but I know it's way down as I am really struggling with it.
Has anyone else had this happen... I know recovery is 18mth+  but for a good bend they prefer b4 12mths this is surgeons and not physios as some physios have unhealthy expectations.

I am looking a little advice, the pain and discomfort in this knee is totally different to the other knee as in it is all centered on the inner side of my knee.

I am currently on 3 different pain meds but getting little relief especially at night and my GP sys next stage is oral morphine which i am relucant to go on as when i took it for other knee spaced me out, felt drowsy all the time and generally had no life. I know it is heading that way again but looking for bit advice or help. Sleep is hard as cant lie on either side as it aggrevates it and cant lie on front as hurts knee.

"I had 2 knee replacements, one on Aug. 28th, 2016 and the other Nov. 2, 2016.  I was doing good, then had a setback and back to therapy, now doing pool exercises.  My problem is not the knee, so much (except I can't kneel without feeling like I'm pinching a nerve on the kneecap) but the thigh muscles right above the knee are very sore, (like you feel when exercising too much) and it is hard to stand up without aid from sitting.  It's very frustrating, and I don't know why it feels this sore.  I wonder, did they cut muscle and it just takes longer to heal?  I'd like a doctor to answer these questions.  I had the therapist do dry needling and it helped for a short while, then the pain was just as bad, so it's a waste of time for me.  They told me it could take a year to feel normal, but I'm thinking it's not going to happen.

Just sitting it sometimes feels uncomfortable and definitely noticeable. None of this is really enough to slow me down but enough that I'm concerned. I am pretty active, excercise, and rest often. I do take naproxen from time to time as necessary. PT told me today that perhaps I was over doing, that I should rest more, and ice several times a day but they really did not have a clue as to what was going on. I have a hard time believing this is the reason but then I don't know. I have a doctor appointment the middle of next month. Has anyone else experienced this or have a suggestion?

"i had a tkr on my right knee on may 10.  After three knee scopes I finally found a doctor that I could trust and who would listen to me.  I had a 26% flexion contracture so bad it was effecting my hip, back, legs and feet and I was in pain 24/7.  My current doctor told me that I should never have had three scopes because it's what lead to the severity of my contracture and I needed my tkr done years ago even though I was only 55.  I'm finally at about  6-8% extension at ten weeks and getting better slowly with the help of a hinge type brace I use three times a day for thirty minutes to work on both my extension and my flexion but it is so painful.  I'm concerned about going back to work even though I sit about 60% of my shift because of the stiffness, pain and lack of sleep.  Has anyone else had a flexion contracture or used the brace to help?  I'm also quite depressed.

"Hi All,
I am at 5 weeks out of total knee replacement.  I am a 61 year old female, and was very active prior to knee problems, activly hiking, riding my horses, running my business, etc.  My surgeon and PT keep telling me that I am ahead of the curve, but I don't feel like it.  Reading the progress of some of you, makes me want to ask a few questions.  I do realize that everyone heals differently, but I am trying to get a good picture of what this process should look like.  I am doing my PT exercises regularly, and attending PT 2 times per week.  I just need to rest so much between attempting to do any task.  If I mop the floor, or run a quick vacuum, prepare a meal for my family, etc. I need to lay down for at least 30 minutes to an hour.  When I do my PT, it leaves me wasted for the next day, and I need even more rest.  My surgeon has released me to drive, and has told me that I should be getting back to my regular routine.  My routine is very busy!  I run a cosmetic business, I take care of horses, etc.  Getting back to this routine seems impossible at this point!  I drove one day, and I have gone grocery shopping with my husband twice.  I visited my horses for the first time yesterday, so I am trying to get back with it.  I appreciate your time in  answering:
1.  How much rest is too much rest at 5 weeks in?  I seem to spend 75% of my time resting either on the bed, or in a recliner.
2.  How long did you need to continue taking the pain meds?  They keep me groggy.  I am trying to cut down, using 1/2 pill at a time.  After PT I have to take a whole pill.
3.  How long before you were able to get back into some kind of normal routine?
Thank you for taking the time to respond.  Blessings on your recovery!

"14 weeks post left TKR, right knee still needs doing. I need your help, at 6 weeks I still couldn't lift leg and I developed an infection but this was contained to one stitch hole and didn't spread. Leg lifted like nothing had happened and infection cleared. Worked really hard on physio at home but disappointed with NHS physio (4 week waiting list and no real exercise in front of physio until 8 weeks). This forum helped me through all that. Visited consultant at 6/7 weeks who said 90 degree bend was standard and to work on straightening as around 4. Didn't actually see Consultant  but another registrar who I had never met. Asked to see me again at 14 weeks (today) to check infection clear. Consultant not there so saw yet another person who said 90 degree bend ( can't move it past this) is now what I am stuck with as too late for manipulation ( I asked last time if possible and doctor said to wait). My knee still has the tight band feeling and is really uncomfortable, doctor said some people are stuck permanently like this and get used to it. I am only 51 and feel disappointed. My other knee is bone on bone and keeps collapsing and desperately needs doing as preventing me from walking without a stick and limp. Not sure what to do... the only wY I can describe my new knee is the knee cap feels wired together and so tight. Do I push to go back again and ask to see consultant or can I do exercise in the gym myself to try to improve?

"Im 8 1/2 weeks out of tkr and still have a lot of swelling and my knee feels like it's stuffed with about a million cotton balls.  Im in PT three times a week, using heat and lots of ice and am back to the pool this week with exercises especially with my ham strings.  I attended my first big outing last night and came home with a very stiff knee and more swelling.  I've been off pain Meds for about a week.  I'm beginning to regret the surgery and just want a life again.  I've read through the discussions but when will this end?  I'm scheduled for a major trip in October and wonder if I'll be up for it.  I'm 73 years old.  Thank you for reading this and for any suggestions you might have.

"Had a R TKR on April 25. Returned at 8 weeks. Physical therapy was going great before returning to work. I was actually ahead of schedule for most of my recovery.
 After my return to work I have been having issues with swelling. Still going to physical therapy twice a week. They re-evaluate me every four weeks. Today was that day.
 I had only improved in one area since last month. If I contnue to stay the same I was told they would have no choice but to release me because that would mean it is not helping me any more.
 This has depressed me so much.To have started out so strong and to end up like this,We are going to schedule me twice a week again this month with half of the classes being pool therapy.
 I ice,rest and elevate my leg as much as i can. I'm up and down at work so elevating or icing it there is not an option.I was told swelling could be ongoing for around 6 months post op.
Any suggestions?

"Both knees make a grinding noise and when you lay your hand on them you can feel knees crunching. If I am on my feet too long my knees are really painful, sometimes I even wake up from my sleep as I have moved a certain way and I get pain in my knees. I struggle when walking down hill especially. I cannot bend or kneel down and I find it difficult to do things with my 3 grandchildren, I am only 49. I have been to doctor who sent me for xray's and when nothing showed up I was then sent for a scan. The doctor refused to carry out the scan as she said that getting a scan usually meant surgery and I would not want to have that. She advsied me to find a form of excersice that would help. This was about 2 year ago and to be honest I just put up with the pain now and accept it as this is how it will be from now on. Can anyone help with some advice on this.

"So after years of recurrent knee dislocations ive now discovered i have trochlear dysplasia and its severe enough to warrant the trochleoplasty op, im told there are only a few surgeons specialising in trochleoplasty in the uk, i was also told that the only one they would recommend is the surgeon from bristol and another surgeon in colorado, i went with bristol..
A bit of background -
At the age of 10 i first dislocated my right knee, i was a swimmer and swam competitively (its apparent the trochlear dysplasia is more severe on the right knee), by 14 id dislocated that knee a good 6 times, i then began dislocating the left. By 23 (the age i am now) i have dislocated both knees over 12 times (lost count after the 12th). I have high functioning autism which also means i have weak muscle tone.
I go to the gym religiously 5 times a week for 3 hours a go.. im really athletic and train obsessively. Recently my knees have been getting worse to the point where my knees dislocate every few weeks and my knees crunch and grind when i walk or go up stairs, i also think im now developing osteoarthritis which is associated with trochlear dysplasia. Im a full time mum to a 2 and 5 year old, i am extremely worried about how id be able to care for them after a trochleoplasty. Luckily i didnt dislocate my knee when pregnant with either of them, however i did have a scary experience with my eldest at 6months old where i dislocated my knee and buckled whilst holding her.
So what i want to know..
1. Has anybody into fitness had this procedure, how did it effect you recovery wise and how did it effect your training after recovery?
2. Has anybody with young children had this operation and what did you do care wise for them during recovery? Did you recieve any form of funds for extra nursery sessions etc?
3. Self care after the op, are you able to go to the toilet yourself? Bath yourself? Or is there a need for extra help i.e friends and family or even a carer?
4. In all honesty how bad is the scarring and how bad is the pain in the first week?
5. When are you able to safely do normal cardio and weight training after the op?
6. Truthfully did you gain much weight by being unable to move around after the op?
7. When are you able to safely drive after the op?
8. For the first few weeks are you wheelchair bound? Ive seen some say crutches an others say wheelchair..
9. How did you get yourself up and down the stairs?
10. If you started to develop osteoarthritis before op does it stop it getting worse if you have the op?
Sorry for the long post but theres so little info online! Thanks in advance x

"Please advise:
I had my left TKR in May 2017 and my pain level is 3/10. My TKR bending was 113 three weeks ago. However my Right knee is schedule for TKR in October this year but my pain level is 8/10.
I have been given three shots of Orthovisc three weeks ago on my right knee to buy some time for me to recover from my left TKR but no change in pain. I also can not bend  my Right knee at all, thus making walk with limp. I also still can not sleep at either side. I do put pillows in between knees but can not hold more than 10 minutes. I sleep on and off streight . I started going to work with my doctor permission 2/week  for 4 hours and it makes my both the knees swollen and very painful. I use ice and ellevation only before bed time. Good news is that I can feel that I am on my recovery mode as well as surgical left TKR. I can bend better but I definitely feel stiff and little swollen ( all the time ) I am eagerly waiting for TKR for right knee.
I would appreciate If some one from this site can advise to control my pain ( already using ice+elevation and can take only Tylonol ) And secondly why I am not been able to sleep at side and what can I do to sleep better and sound.
Thanks to everybody who are involved in Knee pain forums and advise and motivate each other.

"I had a chat with my physiotherapist last week and asked her about knee bend   (is how we tend to refer to it here in Oz).  
I asked her if we all need a bigger number and she said ""no"".  
She said that some people just aren't going to get bigger numbers simply because of the size of the leg.  eg - how can you make a knee go totally flat if you have big legs.
It's more about what can you do and practice things like getting out of chair with no hands, deep bends like squatting and mini squats. Balancing on one foot and rising on the ball of your foot etc.  So don't focus on the numbers just do the practise.
In a nutshell - do the work and you'll be able to do more!

"Hello: Just found this site yesterday and have gained a lot of good insight on issues with TKR; mine was July 5, 2017.
I'm progressing very well, still have pain of course but trying to tough it out without prescription painkillers; so far so good.
I exercise every day, attend physical therapy 3x/week.
I work part time as a barista at Starbucks, a job I've held for 3 yrs and love. My question is: when will I be able to return to work? I realize I've only just finished my 2nd week postop but it's nagging in my mind. 
Has anyone w/TKR have a job where they are on their feet during their entire time working? Could you give me your opinions/experiences/insight? I normally work a 5 to 7-1/2 hr shift, tending usually to work at least 7 hours as our store is always busy, I can use the $$ and I truly enjoy what I do.
Can anyone help with their story?

"Hi Everyone- I am J-21370 and have joined the group a couple months ago. Have received lots of good information that has been very helpfu since I have been having problems with the bend. I am 8 months Post TKR. I went to the doctor and he wanted me to see one of his collegues to see how they can help me since I am too far for a manipulation at least where I had my surgery. The surgeon recommended the Dyna Slpint Brace - one for the bend and one for the extension. The one for the bend I need to wear it 3 times a day for 1 hour each time. And the one for the extension need to sleep with it for at least 5 hours every night. My bend is about 110 and the flexion is between 2 and 3.
I would like to know has anyone has ever used this type of brace and has it work for them. My concern is that I am 8 months post op. Please let me know. I appreciate everyone out there with all the advice that they always provide. A milion thanks.

"I did have a total knee replacement 7 years ago and I have had nothing but problems with it.  I have been seeing another orthopedic doctor and he told me that when my knee was replaced it was not aligned correctly.  He said it needs all taken out and replaced with a newer kind and aligned properly.
I had been getting a lot of pain on my other knee and this new doctor told me it is because I am putting so much weight on that leg because my left knee is so messed up.  He said that I walk with a very notacible limp. 
I am 70 years old and I don't know if I want to go through this again as when I had it replaced 7 years ago it was very painful.  I was told all of the concrete will have to be drilled out which doesn't sound like much fun. 
Has anyone had a knee replacement on the same knee twice?
Thank you so much.

"In December 2015 I twisted my knee at work (I went one way knee went the other) thought I had sprained it, so struggled on for a month before going to Dr. They organised a mri scan, which showed torn meniscus on left side of knee, but had pain on both sides and I was referred to surgeons. The surgeon operated and trimmed the cartilage and I went for physio. During the physio for 3 months she couldn't figure out why I was still having pain over the bone on the right side after the surgeon said it looked normal. I was told to keep up my exercises for 6 months and the Dr would reassess the pain once a year was up, to see where we would go from there!
11 months after surgery I tripped over at work (someone left something in a stupid place) and as I was talking to a customer never saw it. Used my bad leg to stop myself from falling. Instant excruciating pain in knee and thought I'd done it again. Served my customer and had to rest for 30 mins before heading back to shop floor. I gave it a couple days to see if it would settle down but went back to the drs. Was told to take it easy for a couple weeks and if no better to go back. Went back again and they tried to test for snapped acl ligament but my muscles wouldn't allow her to dull check as the pain was unbearable. So I'm waiting to be referred for another mri scan. This time the pain is behind the knee and I have tingling in my toes. I have problems walking upstairs as I feel pressure in my knee and feels like its going to go bang. The same feeling does happen while walking too but not as often. I do still have the pain on the right of my knee over the bone too. But no one can say why.
Does anyone have any advice or had anything similar. I never been so fed up and sore!

Everyone told me you will be so happy you did it and now if I would have known it was this long of recovery I don't know if I would have done it.

"Good morning all,
This is now day 10 post op. 2 questions have emerged.
1-Have developed an itchy rash around the white medicated honey combed shape part of bandage. I peeled it away and air felt great. Hours later, rash still there. Put hydrocortisone 10 on it and then it started oozing.
I cut the adhesive part off or up to the honeycombed medicated mesh part.
Got the hydrocortisone meds off with rubbing alcohol and let it dry.For bed last night I put non stick gauze on it and put rolled up med tape on it for the night
So , here I am,Sunday am and
need to get this addressed today if possible.
The itch drives me nuts.
2- if I am to excersize today and push on the knee,:
a- am I going to open any stitches? and or -b) does the adhesive part of bandadge hold it all in place for the stretching and pushing that I put into it? Last thing I want to do is cut off all adhesive for the itchiness and then set myself backwards and open stitches. Anyone know about this? Thank you

"I'm 10 months post of RTKR had MUA at 8 weeks. 5 months post op I was told I have severe arthofibrosis. I had learned to live with it and most days my knee is swollen some, especially after work.I have an appointment to see my surgeon on Friday for x-rays. The past couple of weeks I have noticed my knee is clunking again and now I'm having some sharp pains again off and on. It started after I walked a mile in sandals. I've been active the past few months. I mow the lawn. tend to the garden. Go walking. I'm hopeful it's just mad from using it more. It's been warm to the touch since the surgery, but not red or rash or any fever. I'm not sick. I'm wondering if maybe I broke up some more scar tissue on my own or maybe I have more scar tissue now. I was doing better( as I never got full ROM back), so doctor doesn't think it's an infection, but will look into that on Friday. I don't know how I would have gotten an infection now anyway. Anyone have any thoughts or words of wisdom?

"I am a 53-year-old female.   I had my left (the worst one) knee replaced April 2016.  I had the right one done in October 2016.  I am very, very much regretting having the surgeries done.  I am going to be brutally honest, as I am in all aspects of my life.  I appreciate the opportunity to vent my frustrations here, but maybe I can help other people make their decisions about TKR.
I am about 80 lbs overweight.  However, I have carried the extra weight for a long time, and I am in good health and still  Yes, I would like to lose it and know that the weight led me to the place I was in regarding my knees.  Bad knees and arthritis run in the family.  My father had his left knee replaced (by the same surgeon a few years ago) and I have an aunt who had both knees replaced.  
I went through rehab after each surgery, and it was annoying and painful. I was told the rehab was successful although painful.  I am a very strong lady--always have been.  I remember going to a yard sale with my friend about a year before the first TKR and being able to shove a refrigerator up the stairs with just a bit of help.  I would strap my knees before I did anything like that because it did then and still does help now. That's a good tip. They are just elastic straps with Velcro. 
Here's the bottom line.  Yes, I was in pain when I walked, okay?  Now, though, it seems like I am still in pain when I walk or climb.  Plus, I can't effing climb the ladders with ease or walk up and down the stairs easily.  I cannot carry anything super heavy and climb or descend stairs.  It's just a different kind of pain from pre-TKR.  This really makes me furious!  I wish I had not had the surgeries.  In fact, before the second one, I called the surgeon's office a couple of times because I was still in a lot of pain and my movements were limited.  They said that my Xrays looked good on the left knee (post-TKR) and we thought that it was ultimately my weight or just the lack of time since the surgery that was probably the cause. There was nothing that would explain my complaints.  I even went to my rehab facility and they told me that I just needed to ""rehab"" the left knee a second time. So I decided to go forward with the right knee/my second TKR.
Before I decided to go the surgical route, the surgeon told me I was ""bone on bone"".  He said it was not surprising I was in pain when I walked.  He led me to believe that there was not much else to do other than a replacement, and that it was just delaying the inevitable. He even put cortisone injections in each knee that day, which did absolutely nothing.  I mentioned the Orthovisc, but he said the insurance company would have to be called to get approval and that it would take a bit of time.  I was in a hurry that day, so I agreed to the cortisone. 
Note: A couple of years before this visit with the surgeon I was living in another state. I had Orthovisc injections (I think that's what the rooster cartilage is called).  I had to pay some out of pocket in addition to insurance, but they did help quite a bit.  In retrospect, I wish I would have done other things such as that to help alleviate my pain instead of the surgery. I should have explored alternatives. My family members were also all pushing me to proceed with the TKRs because they saw me in pain all the time.  I guess at that point I decided that the doctor was right. Now I think he was just looking for another buck.  Okay, maybe I am just p****d off at myself and him.  
I am trying to lose the weight, and I do think there is evidence of some arthritis in my bones.  It certainly runs in the family.  It's been nice to vent.  I welcome any feedback.
Thanks.

"Over the past few months I've been having an on-and-off problem with my left foot. Initially and over the course of a few months, it would only happen occasionally: it felt like I could not control my foot properly when walking and it would weirdly tilt to the left, as if I could not keep it straight when lifting it. At the time I didn't give it too much importance, because it was quite rare.
I'm a reasonably active person, so I continued doing my normal activity: cycle to work every day, play football, run, go to the gym, do trekking. 
Now recently, since about 3 weeks ago, the problem got a lot worse and more frequent. I cannot walk normally without the external part of my foot dragging on the floor. If I concentrate and walk slowly, I can forcefully keep the foot somewhat straight, but if I do it for a while, my foot and leg get really tired and sore, so this is not something I can just start doing every time I walk.
I could never notice this problem while exercising / running, it's always when walking.
Before you tell me to go see a doctor, I have been and have my next appointment schedulled, but this is a rather slow process and I can't see it evolving. My orthopedist says everything looks normal: no loss of muscle strength anywhere (I can completely control my foot and pass all the tests when in rest), had nerve conduction studies which were also normal, can walk on my toes and on my heels, etc. Babinski test is also not positive.
As far as I can remember there was no significant trauma to this leg, other than normal contact when playing football.
I also sometimes feel a slight numbness in the lower leg and foot when seated. I should also add that this condition hasn't been painful so far.
Over this period I've had 3 episodes of my left knee giving way and getting really painfull for the subsequent hours, but my orthopedist and GP tell me it should not be related (which I find suspicious).
I would like to know if anyone experienced (or know someone who did) something similar and know what this is or what kind of exercises I could do to improve this problem (I'm hopping there's some kind of physical treatment I can do to improve this).
Thanks.

"I have had 4 surgeries in 11 months. I fell last August and had to have my patella reattached. I got 2 infections 2 weeks after each surgery, that ended up MRSA. there was packing left in my knee after the 1st surgery that was sitting on top of my femur, tibia, and patella for 5 months. the doctor nor the hospital took any arrays or MRI to see exactly what damage the packing and MRSA did to my knee. the packing came through my 18 inch scar and was draining continuously. I went to my infection disease doctor and when he saw what was going on, he called my surgeon and demanded that he go in and remove everything that was put in during the last 4 surgeries. my SED rate and white blood count was very high but went to normal 2 weeks after surgery. 3 weeks later my knee was looking up and ,would not stand the pain. the doctor finally sent me for a bone scan and MRI. it cane back as osteomyeltis and I went to emory u university where the head surgeon on suggested amputation. my doctor went on vacations after each surgery and it would always take weeks to see him a nd even when I did, his only suggestion was to do more clean out surgeries. my attornees is looking at the medical reports but if he can't find a doctor that I went to over the LAST 6 months to call it packing that's in the pictures, then he won't take the case. the only exray that I had was May 25, 2017 which was way to late to save my leg. I can't find anyone to help me now as the hospital and doctor want return my calls. when emory recommended amputation, everyone scattered. very scared and confused. anyone with suggestions please let me know. thanks to everyone that took time to read my horror story.

"i am 5 months post op of Right TKR. I get stiff and achey constantly. My ankle hurts. I exercise (walk dog for 2 miles), take care of three year old grand daughter and do some substitute teaching  ( I am a retired teacher). At night I have pain when I change positions, from sitting to standing.  I take 500 mug of Naproxen or 800 mg of Ibuprofen. I called my surgeon and found out he has no appointments for the next six weeks.  My six month appointment is end of June so I have to wait until then to address my concerns.
My ankle pain makes walking difficult, yet I continue to do normal activities.  I am not overweight, having lost 40 pounds before my surgery.  Has anyone else had ankle pain?
Advice, please ? I am concerned about the issues related to overuse of NSAID's.

"Hi
Last night I was playing football and was kicked my the opposition.
I was basiclaly running full pelt and tried to take the ball around someone, and he put his boot directly into my knee sending me onto the floor.
The impact was quite hard and because i was running full speed it really went with some force.
The impact hurt pretty bad and i couldnt get to my feet straight away.
I managed to walk after the match although i could feel slight pain in my knee.
The same night when i got in bed my knee completely locked and i couldnt put any weight on my leg, so much so that i couldnt walk.
It feels very weak this morning and whenever i bend the knee it clicks twice, like something is popping in my knee.
Any ideas what this could be???
The knee is slightly swollen and theres minimal bruising.

Two weeks before surgery, I stopped taking hormones as per surgeons request and I am supposed to get back on two weeks after the surgery. Which I did not get back on because I am worry about blood clots. Dr referred mje to internal medicine to get a full panel blood workup . I believe it as my hee knee wanted my system to do something and my system is fighting back. Trying to Renee my cells.

"About 6 1/2 months ago I had left knee arthroscopy to fix an acute meniscus tear and discoid meniscus.  The tear had actually folded over and was causing me a lot of discomfort.  In addition I've also been told I have a lot of wearing down of my cartilage in that knee due to the fact that I have some abnormal anatomy and have chosen running as my sport of choice.  However, I had no persistant pain before this injury/procedure.
I have cotinued to have pain all of this time.  I had gotten back in to short distances (my peak after surgery was 2 very slow miles) but couldn't push through and farther or faster without pain and also couldn't be on my feet doing anything (walking, standing, running) for more than 30 mins.  After an hour even sitting was a relief - I had to get my knee elevated.  I was given a cortisone shot about 2 weeks ago and although that has help extend the length of time on my feet, I'm still in a lot more pain than I was before the surgery.  
The doctors are telling me it is the wearing of the cartilage that is the problem.  But considering I had no pain (I even was running 10 miles a year ago), I'm having trouble accepting this diagnosis.  Has anyone else had the same experience?  Were there any complications that may have happened during surgery that is causing this increase in pain?

"For awhile now, I've had an issue with my left knee. Whenever I kneel or sit with my knee slightly angled, I get a pain in my knee joint. There's a slight popping sound and I need to bend my knee in a way to get it to pop again, back into place I assume. It's a nuisance because every time I kneel I have to be cautious of my knee. It doesn't happen all the time though. Just before, I knelt to plug something in and my knee shifted and I stood up to a strong pain. This only happens in one knee. I have had no other medical issues with my legs, it's an issue I've had for a few years now. I'm a teenager, if this makes any difference. Would just like some advice on what the problem could be.

I have bakers cyst and pain on my knee(while standing or walking), left leg.X-Rays show no bone related problems.

"I saw the Dr for knee pain a few years ago. They did xray and said it was arthritis but not bad. They gave an injection that actually made it worse and PT which helped. It was better for a few years but now it hurts a lot of the time. It actually is on the side of my knee cap, on the inside of my leg. The whole length of the knee cap. Sometimes when I'm walking if feels like my knee is grinding. This is extremely painful and I put on a knee brace. This helps some, but I end up walking without bending my knee. Suggestions? Is it time to go back to the Dr? Does it sound like arthritis?

"I've finally decided to post, in hopes I can get some advice and encouragement from those that have done this before. I'm 46, just had a partial RKR on July 3rd. My surgery was at 3pm, so no food or drink after mid night. I was starving and thirsty before even having surgery! Surgery went well. Came home the same day. Dr. Gave me a script for dilaudid and Robaxin. I guess dilaudid because I had told him I couldn't take hydrocodone, Percocet etc., because it makes me dizzy and vomit. Anyway, I had pretty bad knee pain and was taking the dilaudid 4mg, every 3 hours. I would add in the roboxin occasionally but it made me dizzy and nauseous so I didn't take it very often. From Monday until I think Thursday or Friday-it's all a blur, I took about 30 dilaudid. I was only eating enough to take my meds then back to bed. I deceived to stop taking them and then the next day or so used extra strength Tylenol etc. Ate better, then I started having withdrawal symptoms from the dilaudid. Twitching, feeling really bad etc. This lasted about 3 days. I was tempted to go back on them, just to taper off. While I was off the dilaudid, I was eating fairly regularly. Long story short, I was conctipated from the pain meds and over 2-3 days was impacted and absolutely miserable. I haven't slept or anything. Dr recommended magnesium citrate, finally worked yesterday, I was so back up, and this morning I get the shakes and heart palpitations and I'm dehydrated!! I've had more problems with everything else and not much pain with my knee. I have no appetite but I'm trying to eat something in order to keep my bowels and stuff moving. I am feeling very down and I know it's very early for me at 9 days, but I'm praying for strength to get through each day. Every time I lay down to sleep, my body will twitch due to the dehydration so I'm not getting much sleep... please give me some advice on how to get through this!!

After each session of work on the muscles around the knee, I have felt better but then the knee pain then comes back with a vengeance. The first time it took a week, the last time just 2 hours. My GP has now prescribed anti-inflammatories which are doing nothing but the pain gets worse. I can now only walk a few yards because the pain is so bad. The pain is on the outside of my knee but spreads to the whole knee and around the knee when I move. I am 64, fit but overweight. Where do I go from here as I am now unable to do anything or go anywhere and this is now making me depressed.

"I am able to bend my knee to 102 degrees on my own after the knee excercises in today's session. However they manipulated it to 117 degrees cause that's the correct number to be at.

I know there is pain in the recovery but not the kind to make you scream stop and bring you to tears. I'm ready to switch therapy groups. So what if they make you get to the desired bend at the end of your visits, how is that helping anyone if they are manipulating it? I have pain everyday and swelling and can't stand to even ride in a car or lay on my side yet in bed. Everyone is different I know in the healing process.

"I wonder how many here have found the WII Fit Plus a useful aid in TKR recovery. As it' s winter in Australia and coming from the Snowy Mountains region, finding an adequate indoor exercise to replace walking and assist quad strength can be difficult. But I must say, after making use of the WII fit plus these past weeks, I have noticed considerable improvement in strength and balance.Adding the balance and strength programme to my existing workout ( stationary bike, step ups, squats and stretches) I have gone ahead in leaps and bounds. At six months post tkr I feel almost normal again. I say ""almost"" as having limped for the best part of ten years Im not sure what normal is. I do know I have not felt this good in a long time. So pleased I had this done. The good thing about the WII Fit is not realising just how much you are actually using your knees and surrounding muscles. Anyone else found it to be useful???

"Hi Everyone! I'm Linda and I'm having an outpatient Mako PKR (robotic) on 7/26/17. I'm 61 and in good health and pretty active. (have a personal trainer and was walking a few miles/day before my knee pain). Has anyone had their PKR done using Mako? Would appreciate all tips, precautions, etc. Even if yours was not done robotically, I can use any guidance you care to share.
It seems most here have had TKR's, but my surgeon feels confident my arthritic damage is limited to the medial side. (although I do have intermittent pain on the lateral.) Makes me a bit nervous to go through just the partial and possibly have lateral pain after, but he feels in my case it's better to preserve as much of my own knee as possible as my lateral pain is not usually severe or constant.
It took me quite awhile to make the decision to have the surgery, but after almost 2 years of suffering through 2 rounds of Orthovist, arthroscopy for 2 torn menisci (with microfracture which btw my new surgeon would never do-horribly painful and didn't work!!), multiple weeks of PT and cortisone shots...and still can't walk to the end of the street without pain, I decided to go for it is definitely impacting my quality of life.
Thanks to all who have shared their knowledge so freely. I have been busily reading through as many discussions as I can. But to be honest, with surgery only 3 weeks away, I'm feeling somewhat overwhelmed. Making my detailed to-do lists, but not checking off a whole lot yet! I know I will have other questions...thanks in advance for your help.

"Had TKR last week and it was an outpatient surgery. Haven't seen any others that were done outpatient. Went into the surgery center at 5:30 last Wednesday morning and was home by 1:00. Home health came to visit that day and two days following and my PT started that day as well. Anybody else have this surgery done outpatient? Slow healing process so far but I know I'm early in the game. Have really enjoyed reading this forum. It has helped me Put things into perspective.

"I'm a 23-year old woman from Canada. I have suffered knee problems from 2 years now.. It all started spring 2015, I had had my baby November 2014 and started doing this exercise program in the spring. It included LOTS of squats which I did without wearing shoes. I have flat feet.. I started exercising really fast, and didnt do much stretching. The exercise program was really difficult and I was giving my everything and sometimes wasnt even able to finish, I had to give up. Soo... My knee got to the point I couldnt step on it. Before that I still kept moving, I did biking on a golf course that had very steep hills. I noticed that exercise was making it all worse so I stopped exercising.. This has been the hardest thing in my life, always been really active since I was a little girl and all the sudden I cant exercise. I have become depressed.. This is causing my many emotional problems. To this day, I have stiffness, swelliness, in both of my knees, it comes and goes, sometimes I have better days.. I wear a brace a alot, I have noticed that I dont get the worst swelliness if I have been wearing a brace. The fluid are mostly on top of my knee and on the outer upper side. I can also feel some pain there when my touch there. I have had ultrasounds and X-rays, only showinf fluids. I had one MRI for my left knee (that used to be worse but know my right is way worse) but the MRI just showed fluids. My dr thinks I have RA, but the blood work was negative, only ANA was positive (which is pretty normal, can easily be on a healthy person) My mom has RA on her fingers, thats why my dr thinks I have it too, but I totally feel like no one has really took care of me and see what really is wrong. I dont know what else to say.. this is always on my mind, every step I take i can feel like. Cant believe its been 2 years! I feel like no one understands me. Its been so so hard.. i hope someone has time and interest to read my post.. tell me your thoughts or if you have had similar symptoms! Thank you so much!

"Well, here is a look at my 9 weeks. I know everyone's journey is not the same. We all progress differently. But maybe we can all relate in some ways, too.
* first night in bed last night! No recliner.
* still take a norco at night and 1 before pt
* sleep is still pretty bad
* pain is tolerable, feels like 100 tight rubber bands
* ice leg about once a day at home
* pt three days per week
* ROM is about 115 bend and -3 straighten
* use brace to help straighten 2-4 hours a day
* still cry easily, about once every other day
* incision looks good, is sensitive, and numb
* read this forum for support daily
* don't feel like myself yet, just not joyful
* have to go back to work July 24
* starting to ""see the light on the other side""
Well, for what it's worth, that's my progress report.
And I do feel like I am making progress. Some days I say I don't feel like it but in my heart, (and my knee) I know I am. I know I will be okay. It's taken 9 weeks to get this far and I have a long way to go. I'm glad you are here with me on this journey.

"Hi everyone,
I'm a 23 year old looking for some answers about hip and knee pain. Body wise I'm 5'5', slim and have a pretty high level of fitness (I cycle regularly and do quite a bit of yoga).
Apologies for the mega long message, but I think it's important to include all the detail.
Before all this stared, I'd never had any problems with my knees or joints. About two years ago, I was travelling, carrying a heavy backpack for 2 weeks. About mid way through the trip a problem arose in my knee - while I was walking (freely, without my backpack), I felt a painful slipping feeling in one knee. This didn't seem severe. A few days later, I was off on a trek where we climbed a mountain with hundreds of steps. I could feel tension building in both knees, and I felt the slipping happen in the second knee. Once we got to the third day and I was required to walk downhill, it was nearly impossible. Both knees became increasingly sore and painful (particularly when walking downhill but in general they were very sore). One I got down (I could barely walk) I massaged both knees and had a rest, and they were totally fine the next day.
In the months following that incident, I was a lot more conscious of my knees. I only encountered the slipping feeling once more - but I began to notice a dull ache in one or both of my knees at random times. Walking downhill was definitely something which caused tension. I also noticed that yoga poses which involved my knees could sometimes cause pain, so I was weary of them. (For example, the front knee in pigeon pose). Sometimes fully locking my knees (straight) would cause a feeling of tenderness under the knee cap too.
All this was never really enough to get in the way of my day to day life so I ignored it. Eventually, (about a year after the initial incident), I began to feel pain in my outer hips. It began with another 'slipping' moment, in my left hip (this happened completely randomly). The slipping only happened once. But gradually, I began to notice a dull ache and tenderness develop in both hips, in particular when I walked or hiked for prolonged periods (say when I was travelling).
For the last year, my knee pain seems to have subsided, but my hips usually begin to ache whenever I walk for a few hours at a time. The pain is in the outer part of the hip, almost towards the buttocks. Normally it starts with a dull ache and gradually builds up. If this happens, when I lie down on either side I feel pain on the hip I'm lying on as though it's swollen. It usually is fine by morning, but if I'm tired or haven't had enough sleep (or go for another walk) the pain may persist.
I recently visited a physiotherapist who claims I have weakness on the outside of my hips, so she has given me some exercises to strengthen that area. In the meantime, I have been on a long distance cycle which for the most part was OK, but I experienced intense pain in and around my kneecap on every uphill - which made me realise the knee issue(s) are still very much there. Normally I cycle for about an hour 4 times a week, on flat terrain, without a problem. This was the first time I'd done a long distance cycle (5+ hours, and some proper hills).
I have a follow up appointment in a month's time so I'd like to go there a bit more informed. My main questions are,
- Are my knee and hip pains connected?
- How were these issues caused or how did they develop in the first place?
- Are these conditions which need to be treated or corrected? 
- How can I reach a stage where I can both walk for prolonged periods and cycle long distance without any pain.
Any answers would be incredibly helpful.
Thanks!

"Hiya Friends...so a bit of a twist. Up till now, I was definitely having a Mako PKR on 7/26. However, I have been having pain (although milder than the medial) on the lateral side. It's also not consistent like the medial. I mentioned it to my surgeon 2 weeks ago, but he was still in favor of the partial. The lateral pain continued, but again, still milder and not constant.
Thursday, I had my CT-scan for Mako ""mapping."" Friday, my surgeon's PA called me and said I should consider a TKR as my surgeon now feels if the lateral symptoms progress, I could need a TKR down the line, He based his suggestion on what I told him, seeing evidence of arthritic issues on the CT-scan as well as on previous MRI's. (again, not as severe as the medial, but there nonetheless)
It was actually a relief to me as I had been wondering the same. I would REALLY hate to go through the PKR experience (which can be brutal too) onl to need a total in the future. Also, knowing partials can have higher failure rates and with the Mako being too new for long term results data, I have to say I was nervous having it.
Would love to know your thoughts...surgery is 7/26 and I want to be as prepared as possible! Thank you so much...this Forum is the BEST!

"I'm 23 days out from my total knee replacement and one of the most frustrating things is not having a solid timeline to refer to in order to get a sense of where I am and how I'm doing in my recovery. I'm getting so many conflicting opinions - at three weeks you should be almost pain free and not need meds vs. at three weeks you've barely begun healing and should take pain meds routinely - at three weeks you should be at 0 degrees extension vs. don't expect t more than 10 degrees extension at week 3 - etc etc. what IS normal and is there really a 'normal' at all?

"Well that first post , obviously was a screw up! Let's try again. I discovered this sight purely by accident. I was going out of my mind after 8 weeks since my TKR. I have never felt so sad, depressed, unhappy in my entire life. I am not a crier, but I was crying way too often. One night I googled, "" after TKR, when will I ever feel like me again? Up popped this forum. I read everything posted. As I read I was , yes, yes , yes. Everything others had said was everything I was or had experienced. This was a mental lifesaver. I felt validated in what I was experiencing. I wasn't a big baby or losing my mind or something else wasn't wrong with me. This happens to all TKR patients. I want to say thank you to all that contributed to helping me feel SO much better emotionally. No dr. Or drug could do what this forum has done for me.

"I've been experiencing a problem on the inner part of my left knee. Something (a twist, or bending too far) will trigger what I can only describe as a sliding or a moving on the inner part of my knee. This causes much pain and instability, I can't move my knee without pain, and it cannot bear weight.
Usually I am able to physically straighten my knee with my hands. I then hear and feel a loud ""pop"" and suddenly my knee is fine again. No pain and full range of motion.
Recently I woke up with the sensation that it was out of place and I was unable to fix it. I went to ER and they saw nothing in X-rays because it's not bone situation. Went for and exam with orthopedoc doc, and he said he can't conclude without MRI.
I schedule MRI and literally right before I get into the car, ""pop"" my knee is fine again. I went for the MRI in hopes that they'll still be able to see something, but I'm wondering if anyone has had this experience and can share info.

Sometimes, however, I feel that he holds the stretch too long (sitting up or on my stomach) & the pain is excruciating. Often, those times I continue to have pain the rest of the day. Although my progress has been slow, it's now fairly steady and I'm at the point now that except for PT my pain is manageable & usually don't even need meds.

"05/02/17 I had my left leg done and the pain is unreal. The right was done on 12/15/16 and although I thought that was a tough one and still is the left makes me feel like I whine about it constintly. ""Ouch "" is frequently coming out of my mouth (awake or not.) The major complaint is a pinching in my butt cheek that goes all the way to the back of my calf and to the inside of my foot. I believe it to be Sciatca or muscle pain. It would be great to have someone dig there fingers deep in there and massage the entire length. The other pain just comes as it wants and leaves immediately. It feels like a sharp pain someone refers to it as lighting, which is associated whith a dull pain either right before or afterwards. Any advice? I have a great doctor but feel like a pest.

"Wonder if I'm the only one who had several sore spots along my incision line. I'm 6 weeks out and was bugged that these spots wouldn't heal. Since I'm several hours from my doctor's office, I sort of overstepped my bounds and took matters into my own hands. Pulled gently on the end of a black spot in the sore area and pulled out about 2/3 inch stitch that was left over. The other spot was worst and broke open during ROM exercise. Again, I spotted the end of a stitch and slowly pulled it out. Relief! Areas are healing nicely. This has to be a somewhat common occurrence. Evidently, all inside stitches don't dissolve on their own. Anyone else
have this problem?

My day is pretty much elevate the leg, ice the leg, do the exercises permitted twice a day. Each week my leg brace is put to a different degree so I learn to bend my knee again. It stays locked straight unless I'm bending my knee to the degree twice a day. This is quite painful and the atrophy to my quadricep is substantial. My pt and ortho Doctor say this is of the norm. This has been a very difficult experience so far and wondered if anyone has had this procedure done. I know it's a fairly new procedure that does not have a lot of studies yet to the outcomes.

Now I think it's swelling again . Is this normal ? Only thing I can think is yesterday I was holding , walking with my 10 month old grandson . He's not even that heavy for heavens sake he is a baby !
Just wondering if anyone else continually gets swelling . I hardly think I over did it ?

"Hi I don't know if anyone can give me advice I have RTKR 2012 in Jan 2017
I had a serious infection which resulted in the joint being removed. I had my
Knee fixed for 12 weeks and wore a leg brace I had IV and oral antibiotics for
8 weeks to try and irradiate the infection. I had the 2nd stage done on the 7th
April. My surgeon who informed me he is one of the best in doing revision
Surgery said the operation was complex as they had difficulty making the new
Joint replacement fit due to my very small bones especially the tibia. He tried
3 then settled for a standard AGC knee. I also had anti biotic beads put in around my tibia
Femur and around the knee itself( he has never done this procedure before in a
Knee) and gave me reassurance his college in America advised this is standard
Practice when the infection is severe) I am in the UK He said the beads last a few weeks
Before dissolving ( some actually are inserted then removed after time) . I have
Had to continue wearing the leg brace which is restricting the range of
Movement on the knee to 20 degrees as I have now been told the ligaments
Are unstable Ihave more varus/valgus laxity than he would like and he said
By continuing to wear the brace it will encourage the ligaments to contract
Down. My knee continues to 'give out 'even though I wear the brace
Continually I am still in quite a lot of pain especially the inside and across the
Front of my knee. The consultant says just take pai killers I started physiotherapy
1 hour a week which had now been decreased to 1/2 hour a week as she said
It's too much strain on my knee. I feel very worried and scared for my future iAm 52

Has been any improvement.
Does anyone have a similar experience when I asked the consultant if this is going

"News from further down the line!We are all different, but I am sharing this to offer a perspective from a later time point. (4 months post knee replacement surgery)
At 16 weeks I do have some aching in the knee, but I also bear in mind that as I have resumed normal life and I am not doing so many leg strengthening exercises. However I am using my knee more. I did plan to continue with my exercises and so I am trying to get back into the habit of spending at least half an hour each day working on increasing my strength and stamina. I go the the pool a couple of times a week and spend a good half hour doing exercises with floats on my ankles as well as gradually increasing the duration of my swimming. I use the exercise bike each day for half an hour and I am moving a lot faster than I have done for two years. The over all effect of this is that I feel like a tortoise on roller skates and cannot quite keep up with how fast I am moving. This is amazingly wonderful, and I cannot quite believe it. Just to stand up straight is immensely rewarding and while I am lacking in energy still I feel, in terms of how my how body feels, and get tired very easily, this limitation feels like very little compared to how my life was before the knee replacement surgery.
It’s so exciting to get on the bus and know I can head upstairs or to the slightly raised level downstairs rather than hope like mad the disabled seats are free. Or to spend an evening out standing for a couple of hours without a stick. Or to want something from the shops and decide to take the longer route to the supermarket which isn’t the nearest one. Just to have the option to do so is wonderful! To know I can keep up with another person when walking. To know that I can go for a walk in London, then change my mind and go somewhere else, without having to calculate how/and if I can get where I am going with a limited walking ability of around 15 minutes.
It is the case the the novelty of being able to stand for as long as I need to, walk about and get on with some work…some fantastically BIG paintings at present…has not worn off yet and brings the occasional tear to my eye when I think of it. Happy tear. I can actually start to make plans for the future. I can carry my paintings and take them to where they need to go! I can get on with life and network, and do all the things I need to do as an artist! The knee is FANTASTIC!
My general health seems a bit weak but I think with time I will recover more fully. It is a major operation, and it does take time. Adjusting to a new way of walking takes time too. I have bottom ache most of the time, as now I am taking longer steps I think I am using those muscles more. I have a bit of an ache in the small of my back. My arms are not as toned as they used to be because I am swimming less than I was. I have put on a few pounds… not many, but too many for my liking. So I will continue with losing weight and want to lose another stone by Christmas. Thinking long term.I will continue exercising every day. It is a good habit to keep.
I have not seen the surgeon yet, but will do in a couple of weeks. I did phone the hospital at 6 weeks and was told I would receive a phone call back but it never came. Because I have not had concerns about my range of motion I did not mind waiting but when it got to 12 weeks I really felt the time had come! I called again and got an appointment for mid July… That is around 4 and a half months after! But the poor NHS system is straining under the weight of all the pressure! Oh well, at least I can come leaping and jumping into the room to see the surgeon or one of his team! It’s very important to me to be able to waltz into the room, and now I can!

"Hello Everyone! Especially Jenny 80029 :^)
I have to say this forum really saved my mind. The Dr's do not really prepare you for what you will go thru. I am in the U.S. in Oklahoma. I'm 53. I'm obese. I weighed 294 when I had my knee replacement in Jan.24th 2017. I've been in good health. This was my first elective major surgery. I was diagnosed with bone on bone in my right knee at age 45. I was told then to wait till age 50 to seek a TKR. So by age 52 I'm screaming for a TKR, lol. I had no idea how not weight bearing on the right would gradually get worse. How much my gait would change over time. That is what finally drove me to surgery. My low back, L5 and hips were constantly going out. Over the years I faithfully used my chiropractor, who used cold laser therapy and massage to keep my pain away. It has worked wonderfully till the past two years. 4 Months before my surgery I started going to Accupunture with massage to deal with my chronic low back pain and sore legs. I was amazed at how sore my saphenous vein stayed. I truely was so tired of running to the Chiro doc weekly.
So I went to a large orthopedic group. Went with an experienced Ortho surgeon who worked with my weight. They send you to a class 3 weeks before as others have said. I felt empowered understandingthe sugery, how much exercise to do, when should I be performing certain tasks.
BUT. As we all know. It's not like they paint it to be. They fail to mention all the things I came here, to this forum to begin to cope with and feel normal in my New NORMAL.
my surgery experience was very good. I woke up in the recovery area feeling Alert, ready to eat! Lol. Glad they gave me broth, coffee and jello hours later. My knee, leg was very swollen but not my ankle and foot. In the hospital PT I was able to bend to 82 degrees and not much for straight. I went home to home health nurse for 2 weeks till my post op. I could not bend much at all. By the 3rd nurse visit she was concerned. So at 10 days post op went to out bound therapy evaluation where I was assessed at being behind the curve with 55 degrees of bend and contracture behind the knee.
I find it interesting as I know now, for the Surgeon and PT, its about your numbers.
So began the first 6 weeks of PT. For me looking back I was very blessed the surgical pain was almost gone at 2 weeks. And I was able to only have to take the Oxycontin for PT. After PT 3 x a week it was about dealing with pain and swelling from therapy.
This whole process consumes you. It takes over your life. My husband stayed home with me the first two weeks. By my 5th day post surgery, I could get up and down from my bed by myself, get to the bathroom and kitchen. The fatigue. It doesn't take much to wear you out. I was No Shape before surgery. Going to PT as a fat lady sucked. But I ended up with an amazing PT guy and assistant. I was able to use him the whole 12 weeks. At the end of the 6 weeks I was at 95 degrees and negative 5 for straight.
I went back to my doc and begged to continue PT. I then started twice a week. I returned to my job at 9 weeks. Doc insisted I go back half days for 2 weeks. That was good!
The 2nd 6 weeks of PT was brutal. Doc told them to get me from 95 to 105. My knee capsule was bad, plus the scar tissue setting in. I did not have to do an MUA.
Each session went like this, Bike to warm up 10 mins, gentle force bending 6- 8 mins, back to bike, more force bending. Then total gym squats, single leg , 60 reps. I HATED those.. but saw the benefit, so sucked it up. Finished with one more force bend and ending on the recumbent bike.
Seriously for 6 weeks I did that, with some stair climbs. My PT said that combo helped folks who's knee locked up.
This is a mental game folks. Chico Marx is correct. Our emotions and fears play Jedi mind tricKS on us. The next to last PT session I mentally was DONE. could not take any more. I literally had sessions I cried and hyperventilated. I would always go in with a good attitude, determined. But no amount of pain pills will stop the pain you get from force bending.
You feel out of control over your surgery. The Dr wants you to achieve 95 degrees or more right away. As you now face the daily trauma of trying to live post surgery you feel you have something wrong. Your surgery is not working! Why does the pain not get under control? I'm still swelling at which ever week later it is..
This forum, you ALL. Made me see Slow and Steady wins the race! Because it's not a race!! It's healing at its own pace. You have to determine to keep stretching, working that knee!! Don't get lazy..
By the end of my 12 weeks I purchased a used recumbent bike, a Therapy strap and ankle weights of 3 lbs.. I graduated at 105 degrees passive bend and negative 4 on straight. My PT strongly encouraged me to keep gaining ground slowly by keep up with strength and exercise.
The Joy came when you see all the little changes you can do again. Like moving the leg back under the covers freely! Not using the cane when I get up to potty in the night. When I worked out in my yard for 5 hours and no sitting!!! I can walk fast again!
Like Jenny 80029 has said, being able to walk and carry her paintings is FABULOUS! I CAN LIVE WELL AGAIN.
I still need to work on strengthening my legs . Going down stairs I use the hand rail, but not going up! My Gait is good again!
How many of you toe out since the surgery?? I DO have to focus on my heel toe action as I walk. I'm going to buy those rubber bands you work out in..
I always slept well after surgery. Never had any odd pains except occasional. I am pain free for quite some time now. I still have a stiff knee from about 4- 5 hours after being up. It gets aches especially in the lower segment where the implant is. It feels like Arthritis in my joint! My surgeon assured me this is the bone healing from the trauma of being drilled and cemented. On the right side of the knee is where I still get achy numbness? Odd tingling by end of many days.
I have a heel lift I wear in my left shoes.
Although my joy again is being able to wear good sandals that are sturdy but cute!!
Finally, I am beyond grateful I did this. With my health Ins I paid out 3,000.00 total. My initial cost of surgery was 48,000. With my insurance discount it reduced to 28,000.00
It's taken me to 4 Months to feel better, have energy again and ambulating well. After seeing what problems many of you have and are facing, I know I did way better surgically then many.
I strongly encourage you to keep re reading posts by Chico Marx, keep looking at discussions here. Keep as active as you can. Keep icing that knee! I still use my ice machine at bedtime!!
Good Healing to us all!! God Bless you with healing, good knee replacements!!

It's also reddish and warm but not hot. No infection as far as I can determine. The sensitivity does not seem to improve. Is this sensitivity normal?  Anyone else experience this?  The outer side is numb and I understand that is normal. Thanks in advance!

"In January, I was doing pivot exercises and really hurt my knee..I am 39. I noticed right away part of knee was sticking out (no longer round) . I iced and rested it 3-4 days and it got worse and I could not bend it at all.. I went to urgent care and they forwarded me to ortho. They spent about 15 seconds with me and assumed it was torn meniscus. Had MRI and they called and said didn't feel it was that and just bad sprain and do 8 weeks PT 3x a week. first few weeks were sooo hard as I couldn't bend without huge pain but pt definitely helped. They said I had patellar traction problem and it would take 6 months to fully go away. But still that ""bone"" or whatever sticks out has not gone down. It literally feels like someone has whacked me in the knee at all times, constant dull ache and still crunches and clicks when I swing back and forth. I went back 3 months ago and again spent 30 seconds on me and said I may have a bit of arthritis in it too so gave me a cortisone shot that did nothing but make me gain 10 pounds in 5 days! So here I am not knowing what to do....I'm depressed. Because I can't run or exercise like I used too (squats lunges etc)... and the pain is starting to go up my left side thigh again. But the main part is why can't they answer why this clearly sticks out? I wish I could post a picture so people could see what I mean....it's not round it clearly is pointed and hard like it's the femur and that's where the pain is..any guidance at all?

"I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem getting any pain meds that actually help.
I'm 8 weeks post TKR & progressing very slowly so scheduled for manipulation.
I've tried Oxycodone, Dilautid & morphine (separately of course) with no relief. Apparently I'm unusual in that I have a very high tolerance to pain meds & therefore it's very difficult during PT or my own exercises to get the required flexion.
Has anyone had a similar experience & find any meds that work?

"Going to (try) to be brief. I was born with knock knees, my feet have always pointed inwards, I had my first dislocation in (r) knee at age 9, 2nd was at 11, a dislocation in (l) knee at 12, and 3 more dislocations in the (r) between 2015-2016.They all required an ER doctor to reduce, 6+ weeks rest, crutches, braced.
Diagnosed with osteoarthritis in right knee in 2009. Left knee, 2010. Have been having real difficulty since 2015 with the pain, and in the past year, the LEFT knee has become extremely painful, the last 3 months, excruciating pain. Keeping me from walking, getting out of bed. Now have a walker. I am 36 years old. I had lost 60lbs by 2015, and just about 30lbs overweight. I was so active, and swam daily. It didn't matter, the arthritis progressed.
I have tried so many things for years. ibuprofen 600, tylenols, lidocaine patches,shots and so on. Nothing is helping now, and I FINALLY got my doc to prescribe something (tramadol) its helped some, but it still is painful and thats to be expected. He originally said ""Youre to young for the surgery"" until my 4th visit, he sent me to his associate who said ""Its crazy to do this surgery on someone your age."" Went back to the original ortho doc, who is sending me to someone else for another opinion. I am concerned because of the mixed answers and opinions on this. This knee is comparable to someone in their elder years, 70s or so. 
I am tired of suffering but I am wondering if surgery is the best option? Trying to get something realistic for the pain is like pulling teeth I assume from all of the opioate abusers, and I really cannot continue on with this pain.

"Hi,
I have problems with my right knee and hip and have gone beyond being desparate for relief.
I am averaging about 2 hours of sleep a night, most of the time it feels like someone is trying to pry my knee cap off, I can't bend my leg because my hip joint is very painful, I am taking 2 hydrocodone 10/325 mg tabs every 5 to 6 hours and they just dull the pain.
If i am sitting I have to struggle to get up, I can't get in the car because I can't bend my leg enough to get my foot in the door.
I am supposed to be working full time but the pain is making it near impossible to do anything.
I had an mri of my right knee and there is what the doctor describes as pebbles located behind the knee cap but I can't get it fixed because I have been fighting a kidney infection for the past month.
Both of my rotator cuffs are trashed so even moving my arms has become challenging.
I am really at the end of my rope.

"Hi all,
the more and more I read, it is very clear that the knee will require a great deal of exercise following the surgery and during recovery.  This is becoming a big concern of mine.
I can no walk longer than about 10 minutes due to pain in my feet, and it is a slow pace.  I used to walk about 2-3 hours most days of the week - I LOVED walking - but since I had a double Cheilectomy due to arthritis - they have only gotten worse and worse, and some days are nearly crippling.
I do  not know if I will physically be able to do that moch walking, etc.  
There must be others in this position, andI was wondering if there are other means of physio to sort you out?  
How soon can we get the leg wet after the op?  ANd how long until you can swim?   Or what other types of physio would help in a situation like this?  A gym with resistance weights?  Cycling?  Or a treadmill (I could probably do twice as long on a tread mill.

Any words of encouragement?

Feels unstable, it doesn't hurt, and it's never given way, it just sort of pops round? So I avoid too much walking? Should I walk more, I think it's the muscles round the knee, does anyone else experience this? Should I be worried or is it still early days and I must keep on? Is there an exercise I should concentrate on to help strengthen this area? It's the left hand side of my knee that pops? Really disconcerting!

The surgeon said the clicking sound is the plastic knee cap hitting the joint, that it is not unusual, and that I might have it the rest of my life.  Is that common for the rest of you?  
Also, do you also have pain when your knee goes lateral, either when walking or lying down?

"Has anyone ever experienced their back fusing itself? I went to an orthopedic doctor in reference to my TKP. He had x-rays done of my knee and back and recommended that I do not let anyone tell me that I need a fusion in my back becuz it has fused itself. Well, I still have the same symptoms of tingling, burning, numbness like a string tied tight around my toes. Was diagnosed with spinal stenosis, arthritis in lower lumbar, heriated, bulging disc in L4, L5. Had a sequestered disc removed which was suppose to be bulging and heriated in 2011. A year later was told it was herniated and bulging again. I don't work and did no strengthous exercises to even cause it to re-herniated anything. I don't have back pain, only leg pain. I don't like taking pain meds for they are too harsh on the body. Only 61 and walk like 81. I refuse 5o give up and settle for all these different medical opinions. I've researched and found more from these board discussions than the ones who were paid thousands of dollars to operate. Sad but it's true. My knee is feeling much better after following personal video posting of others. 6 mos recovery turned into 2 years and still got ways to go but I do see improvement finally. It's been rough I must admit.

"One month ago I had my sixth knee surgery to my right knee. Previously, I've had three ACL reconstructions, one bone graph, and in the last five months two meniscectomies: #5 removed torn cartilage from the posterior. A month later it retore in two more spots in the posterior. My most recent surgery (May 26) removed more of my medial from the same spot as the previous year, as well as stitched a small tear further back in the posterior horn.
Here's my issue: Admittadely, I'm not a good patient. I'm a very manic person who manages that anxious energy with fitness. At three weeks I got into a swimming pool and did crawl stroke laps. I also, unfortunately swam a few strokes scissor and breath stroke kicking. I stopped as neither one of those felt good, at all. I came to learn after the fact that neither one of those strokes was smart as the free range can be compromising. My thought was limited impact is safe, but now the range of motion, which I was aware of and didn't feel like I overdid, is starting to make me second guess myself.
Afterward my legs were very fatigued, which was to be expected. However I also - over the next few days - experienced pretty significant swelling, and what felt like a Baker's cyst (behind the leg discomfort).
I'm still experiencing a tightness from the medial portion of my knee that feels like it could be the scutcher healing as it's not coming from the rear like a Baker's cyst but more of the medial/rear.
Here's the thing, though: If I push around the medial joint line I can pinpoint pain. It's not terrible, but what I noticed from previous tears is that pain is more significant after usage and other than that one swim and walking my use of that leg has been very limited. I'm starting to wonder if once I begin therapy whether that joint pain will increase because the repair did indeed fail.
I do not see my doctor for another couple of weeks. Is it common to be experiencing joint line tenderness a month after a meniscectomy / repair?
Would the tightness I'm feeling when flexing my calf, as well as the intermittent ""burning"" sensation be consistent with a failed repair or a healing scutcher?
Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

"Hey guys!
I've torn my acl back in October and went under the knife on 6th april. My rehab is going great, i go to the physical therapist 3 times a week. After 1 month, the physical therapist suggested to lower the use of my brace if I go to places where the ground is even and i won't risk falling on the ground. So I'm going to school without my brace for the last month and a half and i havent had any problems at all!
2 Weeks ago I suddently made a popping sound coming from my right knee which has been treated for my acl. I realised that while i am sitting that my knee rotates more than it should, like it turns more than I can with my left knee. I asked my physical therapist about it and when he checked if my knee was stable, he replied saying that my knee seems to be stable but he didn't say anything about why my knee rotates unusually more than it should when i am sitting. The popping sound i mentioned is not a big deal because I think that its just the mucles or something that go over eachother and make that noise because it happens often that i hear the noise. 
I hope someone understands what i am talking about and is able to give me some relevant information!
Sorry for my poor English

Right now I am disappointed due to flexion and straight. I'm at -10 straight and 100 bend and here I am at 8 weeks recovery..

"Hi, I'm almost a year out from a TKR on my right knee. My surgeon has told me I have developed arthrofibrosis in it. While I know what it is, I'm wondering if anyone here has had any experience with it? My surgeon has advised me that it will probably end up resolving itself, but that the process would be slow, possibly 1-2 years. Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks, Michelle

"As I type this one-handed on my phone, my left knee is undergoing one of the strangest sensations I've felt in my life. The outermost edge of the knee feels ""popped""— like a tendon or something similar has simply popped out of place. However, it feels like two bones (I know that sounds absurd) are bending against each other, and if I move my leg AT ALL they'll snap. Needless to say, it's terrible, unique pain, and I can't bend my knee in or out by millimeters without feeling like I'm going to Tear my ACL or something similarly horrible. Thing is, it happened to me earlier this year as well. I was lying on the beach to get up, and as I move my leg to the side the same thing happened, this time on the right knee. Three hours later, i'm sitting in a hospital bed and I can simply bend my knee out with zero issues whatsoever. I do experienced issues with my knee all my life ( I have patella subloxia), but never in my left one, and never anything as painful or is limiting as the type of incident I'm describing now. Is there any advice on this? I know it isn't worth a visit in the hospital. I do not want to sit around immobile for three hours at two in the morning.

"After failed cortisone (knees and hip) and Synvisc injections in both knees, my consultant has offered me Durolane in my right hip ( which is also showing a lot of wear and tear and is very painful) and in both knees. He will give me the injections in theatre under a general anaesthetic before, as he says, as a final resort, he begins replacing parts of me! He has never used Duralane in the knees before even though it's use is licensed. Does anyone else have experience of this injection and how does it fare against Synvisc?

"Hello, I am 10 weeks post TJR.. have a question I've not seen in any other discussion. I had my right knee done and doing well... can straighten 100 % and bend is 120. BUT
As for walking.. my non operated on leg is killing me!!! I will be getting that knee replaced as soon as insurance and schedules get figured out.. but in the meantime, I can not walk anywhere near normal UNLESS I'm on maximum pain relief! Even then I limp, but it doesn't hurt as much.
The pain is all from my bad leg, but really worried. I can't walk half a block without intense pain, by the end of the day I walk like I have a wooden leg with absolutely no bend!!! Need some feedback, please!?

"So I realize everyone's journey is different, but after scouring websites and listening to my physical therapist, the consensus seems to be I should be walking several blocks with no walking aids at this point. And after 4 weeks I should be walking a half mile. I use a cane everywhere I go, which at this point is a very short walk to the mailbox each day and to PT twice a week. Yes I walk around my 900 square foot apartment, and I do have 15 stairs to climb going in and out of my 2nd floor apartment. But there is no way I could do a block, let alone a half mile. After showering, getting dressed, putting shoes on, going down the stairs, walking out to the mailbox, back up the stairs and taking off my shoes, I'm literally exhausted. I grab my ice pack and collapse on the couch with my feet up as high as possible. After 30 minutes I get up from the couch and my knee is so stiff I can barely move. 
I'm faithfullly doing my prescibed PT home exercises twice a day. I elevate my feet above my nose at least twice a day, apply ice at least 4-5 times a day for 30 minutes and slowly weening off pain meds. If I try to walk without my cane I'm still limping. My knee is so stiff it takes me 5 minutes to get out of bed in the morning.
I'd love to hear about everyone's experiences with timeframes on being able to walk with no aids and distances.

I already am past therapy timeframe as my surgeon told me at least six weeks and then I'm on my own. Plus I owed them $$$. I called my PA. And she asked me how am I doing and I told her how I feel and my strength and weaknesses. She said I can do this on my own as long as I keep up. And she will see me next Friday which will be 8th week! She may say I need therapy and if I do I will be going to someone else whom I've known them for several years.

"I had a tkr 5 weeks ago today. It went swimmingly. After two weeks staples were rremoved and it looked like an ancient scar. At 3 weeks i had 0 extension and 118 flexion. I had left knee done because I kept falling over. Last year I broke my neck and scalped myself falling thru a window. Had to do the surgery or die. It is so good, I want to do the other knee in three months. Get it over with before winter. With no cartilage at all, the other knee grinds and I get shocks if I walk to much. But I don't fall. My new knee still swells a little. I still ice daily. My only problem is that I can't sleep easily. I go from bed to chair to bed to chair. I slept about 18 hrs a day the first 3 weeks, but now I am a zombie. No real pain, just cant get comfortable. If the one leg is ok, the other leg isnt. I am hoping thing will change with two TKRs. Anyone else have two TKRs in 4 months? Thanx.

"Good morning. I've had a problem with my left knee for about 2 years now. I was a keen runner and it's got to the point where if I run I can hardly walk on it the following day. But when I don't run. And I'm fully rested. If I'm seated and keep my knee in a 90 degree position for over 10 minutes I get a really uncomfortable pain and the longer I leave it like that. The more the pain gets worse. But as soon as I straighten my leg out it's an instant sense of relief. I've had an x-ray that's shown nothing. I've been having physio for over a year which hasn't helped. Any help would be appreciated. Cheers

"i had knee replacement in my right knee Feb 21st.  I did PT for about six weeks until the therapist said there was nothing more he could do and I was $500 away from my Medicare ceiling.  He was afraid I may need manual adjustment because my ROM was only 98 and would need additional therapy.  
I decided I needed more exercise so I signed up with a personal trainer today. 
It was the best thing I've done in forever.  She said I was surprisingly strong but very tight muscles.  My new knee performed very well.  Rowing, biking (can't go all around...yet) squats, a dance moves, I'm amazed.  
So, with that said, all things are good and it looks like the titanium knee is doing its thing, I'm starting to love it.  I'm a little sore right now but,that's 
expected.

"Hello everyone! I'm brand new to the forum and looking for advice about pain meds. I'm in the US, medium sized city in the Midwest. Surgery done at a top notch hospital. Stayed 2 nights with no complications other than severe pain. While in the hospital I was on a regimin of Norco 10/325 and 5mg oxycodone, staggered every 3 hours. Upon discharge, surgeon wrote prescriptions for 2 weeks of the same strengths of both Norco and oxycodone, each to be taken every 4 hours. I scheduled them so I'd be taking one or the other every 2 hours. For the most part this has worked well. There were only a couple times when I took two oxys at the same time after physical therapy. The pain was almost unbearable.
I had my 2 week post-op visit and staples removed earlier this week. Saw my surgeon very briefly and I asked for a refill of both meds. He looked at me with a scowl on his face and told me ""we don't prescribe narcotics beyond 14 days"". I explained I was having trouble sleeping due to waking up in pain. Most nights I'm lucky to get 4 hours of sleep. I mentioned how much pain physical therapy was causing, including the obvious fact that pain was keeping me from being able to do specific exercises.
To make a long story short, surgeon grudgingly agreed to one more week of just the oxycodone. In my opinion, it's gonna take a week just to taper off the oxy. I've started trying to go 6 hours between doses but it's not going well. Pain is not going away anytime soon. I ice and elevate at least 30 minutes every 2 hours.
Please don't suggest I talk to my PCP. He is so anti pain medication that upon meeting him the first time several years ago, the VERY first words out of his? mouth were ""We don't prescribe narcotics here"".

I was fine the first 10 days but since then ive suffered really badly with nausea and constipation and even though ive stopped being sick i still feel waves of nausea come over me every now and again and even though i take stuff for my constipation and its worked i still feel really nauseous most of the time. Ive taken a 5mg patch off so now i am just taking 30mg and hope this might make me feel better.

It just seems that the swelling will never go away. My next visit with my surgeon is 2 weeks, and I am terrified that he will want to drain it.

"I write this as an encouragement to those at earlier stages of recovery. I now have turned a corner with this process..it was a corner I didn't see coming! If things are hard, take heart, live your knee be kind to yourself and keep up the work with gentle exercises and stretches, because you will reap the rewards in time. I know often there are complications ans set backs, and sometimes people have particularly rough rides, but for most people TKR really is a wonderful surgery which can potentially give you your life back. I have just finished my formal physiotherapy and though exceptionally tired, and very much still in recovery, I walked more quickly on a treadmill today than I have walked for two years. My range of motion is 0 extension and 130 flexion. I only ever did passive physiotherapy, I never caused myself any pain, only discomfort, and I never let anyone else cause me pain either (except for the surgeon, by doing the op!). I did my exercises, and will continue to do so. I still have some soreness, sometimes. But I can walk. I don't limp anymore. I can start to think about the things I can do and open doors which were previously swinging back in my face. The timescale is different for everyone, and I have been fortunate. I have gone from having what was a doubly deformed limb, to one which has now the ability to move properly and take me the places I want to go. I may well have set backs...I may well need it revised as I am only 52, But now I have a life which opens up before me and the earlier pain, low feelings, despair, anxiety, sleeplessness, tension, worry, fear, discouragement, etc now all of that feels worth it. I had decided in my head that I would not decide if it was worth it until the one year point. We just don't know how long the struggles we have in life will go on for. For me its fallen into place quite early, that's a blessing, because the two years leading up to surgery were a struggle. But however long it takes, for the majority of people, this difficult time is an investment that they will reap the reward for. So please read this and take it as an encouragement. Sometimes we just don't know when we will suddenly turn that corner and its so easy to not believe it will ever happen. Use your mind in the process, and trust that however long it takes, you will get to a point where the current which carries you along does reach a still and peaceful place. You will look back, and see how far you have come. Things don't always work out...that is true, but for most people if does work out in the end. It works out well, and the current troubles are left behind, I could not of imagined being where I am now. It makes me quite tearful thinking about it but in a good way. I cannot quite believe how wonderful it is.If I live long enough, I am not looking forward to having it redone, but I have changed as a person through this experience and am all the better for it in so many ways. So keep on, even though the limitations are so great. Know that your world will open up before you, and know that you can use this challenging experience.. the powerlessness is hard to bear, but legs do get stronger with time. And after all these words, i hope i dont suddenly fall over and crack my nice new knee, get an infection, or get run over by a bus. I have now taken to nipping across the roads when the lights are still green, because I am so excited about how I can walk. I used to not make it across the crossing in time, even when pressing the button...you know that number countdown made me sad. I still use my walking poles sometimes, and may well continue to need support at times. I couldn't walk very well at all just a couple of weeks back. Then things did just fall into place. Wow. And TKR still suffers from the curse of being called ""a procedure of limited clinical value"" here in the uk. Dont believe it. I must also add that though i am certainly in the gentle physiotherapy camp, I do recognise that for some different approaches do work well. As we often comment on here, we really are all different. Different knees, different kinds of support different challenges. But this is 13 weeks for me!

My name is Harvey and I am 15. I love lifting weights, but a loud popping noise in my knee is preventing me from squatting well. It does not hurt, it is just uncomfortable and frustrating. I have had it for many years!

"I had been an ardent follower of this porta; until last year when I was supposed to undergo arthroscopy for a tear in discoid medial meniscus. I thought its my moral duty to give it back to this blog about my recovery and experience so that other people might benefit.
Its almost an year after my surgery. As stated, I had a developed a tear in my discoid medial meniscus and carried it for as long as 15 yrs. Last Feb, after a long drive, the pain became so bad that I had to consult a Dr and the MRI revealed that I have a torn meniscus that too a discoid one. Consulted few other doctors and other physio therapists in the hope that even if one says the surgery isn’t needed, I will postpone it. Not even one of those people suggested to not go for the surgery. It took me another 4 months to convince myself to go under the knife.
My surgery was 75 min long procedure under spinal anesthesia and was asked to stay in the ward for the night. The torn and the extra portion was trimmed and 3 Fastfix sutures were implanted in the meniscus.
The next morning I was told to use a walker and a brace for 2 weeks and not bend my knee for those many days. After a follow up 2 weeks later, the knee was allowed to bend by 30 degrees with the brace and after another 4 weeks, the angle was increased to 90 degrees. All this while I was also advised physio which I diligently carried out. The pain from tear went away and what remained was the post operative pain which was subsiding every passing day.
Fast forward to almost an year, today I feel confident and better than I have ever felt. I do trade cautiously though (no unnecessary jumping or running, no kick-starting my motor bike etc) and still doing things to fully strengthen my right leg. Occasionally(2-3 months) I do feel some pain near the spot for 2-3 days but its nothing that is very bothering for me.
I’ve been satisfied with my surgery and recovery and wish all of my friends over here a very happy and speedy recovery.
IMPORTANT TIP: Those who may be planning for a surgery in next few days or weeks, please don't read up over the web. It might further terrify and depress you. Do a research on your Doctor and have good faith on him/her.

"Morning all
I'm now 6 days post PKR and not sure if I'm making progress or not ? Just wondering what other people's experiences are. I'm 49 and needed this surgery to deal with the pain in my knee due to osteoarthritis. The op went well, stayed overnight and came home. I'm trying to do something different each day - getting up getting dressed having a shower, but each day is the same at the moment. I'm exhausted doing all of the above even going to the loo is like climbing a mountain. Should I be doing more? Someone mentioned putting a baking tray under my bad foot to move back and forth is this simething to do now? - I start physio in a weeks time but do I need to be doing more now. Pain wise is awful but sheer grit is making me get up and ""do"" still on pain relief - agin is this everyone else's experience - all leg is quite numb is the sensation likely to return.

"Hi guys, just thought i would bring you up to date with my progess. Saw my consultant today and he's really pleased with my progress. Apparently mine was very complex as it was very badly deformed (i was knock-kneed) and it is now completely straight. I can wear my skinny jeans again which is fab. He is happy with my bend 120 now although im not fully straight yet but he said that will come with time. Ive lost a lot of muscle so its going to take time to build them up but im keeping up with physio and using my stationery bike. On the whole im really happy my knee feels more stable and is not as painful. Im able to do bits of housework now and im walking around the house unaided although i still use a crutch when im out for confidence and the main thing is im driving again which is great. I still have pain but its a lot better than it was, i have arthritis anyway so i expected that. The pain management team have taken me off the oxycodone now and i feel so much better it was making me really drowsy. Im still on tramadol for another 6 weeks and all in all i feel like im well on the way to getting back to normal although i know its going to take months in fact my consultant doesnt want to see me now for 6 months. My conxultant has been great ive read so many stories on here about consultants pushing you about your bend etc but mine never did he said everybody heals at their own pace and as long as you exercise but dont push so it hurts you will get there.
On a more serious note i was disappointed to read that one of our members is leaving this forum due to feeling she cannot express her views. Everybodys experience of tkr is different some suffer horrendously and some sail through it and some like me just get through it as best they can hoping it will be worth it in the end which in the majority of cases it usually is. This forum is for everyones experiences and i know i could not have managed without it. There has been many a night where i have been worried about a particular pain in my knee only to visit this site and have my fears put to rest.
Take care

"While I think this group is brilliant for anyone struggling after a knee replacement when they're having difficulties, I've come to the conclusion it is definitely not the group for me.  There is so much negativity.  While I totally understand that for some, especially people who are more likely to seek out a group for support because they have problems, it's ideal, the suggestion that it's normal to have excrutiating pain from a knee replacement I just will never agree with.  Yes, some may well have severe pain, but many will not and many will not struggle as is SO OFTEN suggested on here.  I recommended this group to someone waiting for a knee replacement and they ended up at their doctors with depression because they were frightened out of their mind by what they'd read on here.   I was horrified when they told me.   I would NEVER, therefore, recommend it to anyone who is going to have a knee replacement.  I don't see any point at all in working someone up to a state of anxiety before an operation.  I feel it's morally wrong.  I have met some wonderful people on here, who will be in my thoughts.   Marilyn - I hope you get a date soon!  But I've also met the most arrogant that I've come across in all my life and when their words are directed at the vulnerable this can do severe damage.  As we've seen, one lady thinking of putting off her knee op because she'd been frightened by a person on this group, and also the chap who wrote 'shame on you' for frightening him so much before his knee replacement that he found very tolerable.  I can't - won't - be part of a group that I believe KNOWS they are frightening people before an operation by telling them 'you are likely to get this pain that is hell' and so on.  There seems to be a lack of concern when someone has expressed their anxiety from what has been said to them on here - just a justification of 'well this will happen to you'.  Even when someone said recently how well it was going they were told not to get too cocky.  As a group to help people who have difficulties, it's ideal, but for someone about to go into an operation there is no balance at all and they would be better to steer well clear.
I do wish all of you with diffulties a good recovery and I'm sure at the end of it you'll be very pleased that you got your knee replacement.  At three months post TKR my knee gives me no trouble at all, and it's felt very natural for weeks.  For those thinking of having a TKR, I personally had virtually no pain, stopped painkillers on the second day and everything has gone like a dream - it couldn't have been better, and I'm looking forward to the next knee being done soon.  PLEASE, if you're thinking of having the operation, keep in mind that more people seek out a group because they need support because they are the ones with difficulties, where the ones without any problems, more often than not, don't go online to talk about it, but just get on with their lives, enjoying their new knee, with wonderful mobility and lack of the horrible pain of arthritis.

"I saw my consultant for the first time today post TKR. I am just over 7 weeks and have been worried about my bend that is just at 90. He was completely fine with it and said it will improve slowly over the next 6 months. He was keener for my extension to be 0 ( mine is 6). I had an infection in one of the stitch holes and have been on antibiotics for that, so he is reviewing me in 4 weeks. I have only just been able to lift my leg too so he is keeping an eye on that. I was so worried before the appointment that I wanted to share this with new people, it's a slow process, often with setbacks but keep going, as I will. He warned about overdoing PT and he said to listen to my body. I do my PT three times a day as I have not yet reached the top of the waiting list for PT exercise in NHS. I simply get assessed every time I go. Good luck to everyone with their recovery.

"I have posted previously re pain after tkr, but as that was a long thread, have started this.
?After a rocky start with what seemed to me excessive pain, swelling and stiffness, a few things did improve. The extension and leg lifting are all right and sleep a little better with usually less nasty pain (there are sometimes relapses). BUT the stiffness and swelling just won't resolve, icing and elevating feel better but no reduction in symptoms and despite gentle and frequent moves as instructed, there is just no budging the knee to bend and it is stuck about 40 degrees (about 80 in hospital).
?Physio could not budge it either, so I am currently chasing up the surgeon's office as they have not called me in for a follow up.
?I am finding this difficult as I really thought thing would improve with time and following advice. Due to the terrible pain I went through post op, I am terrified ofany more surgery or interventions and the longer this goes on, the more I fear this will be the outcome as I never heard yet of anyone regaining ROM from this point without help. I don't feel I can face going through the pain and meds do not suit me or work well, the GP only wanted to take me off them, not help me manage the pain.
?I guess I must either have extreme scar tissue or something wrong with the prosthesis. I know I'm getting ahead here but I am just so worried as the first surgery has taken so much out of me and it was not long since my gallbladder surgery and before that a year of illness. I have hardly been outside or lived a normal life or been out of pain.
Has anyone ever been in this situation and what was done?

"OK...so here's another post since, like I've said before, I keep writing the same stuff over and over again.  This one's about walking...
You all know that they get you out of bed IMMEDIATELY at the hospital to get you walking again.  This makes walking the #1 exercise you can do post-TKR.  Great way to get your life back and start to break down that scar tissue.
So walking is of the most recommended activities but you have to avoid any impact...no running, jogging, etc.  Most docs will suggest an elliptical machine or bike which have zero knee impact.  If on a treadmill, you walk slowly, heel to toe.  On hard concrete, get fitted for a fantastic, cushy pair of walking shoes (treat yourself!).  It's all about keeping pressure and impact off the knee.  A great pair of shoes is essential.
How often you walk is measured in steps...NOT MILES or KMs.  Push the knee too far and it swells..period.  Then it's back to rest, ice, elevate.  The idea is to avoid that completely.  To do that, you need to TRACK YOUR STEPS!!!  
Get a pedometer (Fit Bit, Smart Watch, etc.) and track every step.  Find your ""pain point"" (swelling baseline)...back off...ice...elevate...increase gradually.  I did 8,200+ steps at 5 weeks and ended up with a hot-air balloon for a knee.  Never did that again.  Slow and steady increases.  By 8 months, I was doing 11,000+ steps (5 miles) with zero swelling or pain.
There is no set of guidelines on how many steps you can/should do in a day/week/month.  Everyone is different. You have to find your own limits and proceed from there.  Believe me...your knee will yell at you when you've exceeded your current limit.  So again...it's not miles...it's the steps that matter.  You can walk every day if you like...just watch the steps.  Take a day off here and there when you are tired or are experiencing pain or swelling.  It's all very personal.  Listen to your knee!
Any electronic pedometer will hook to your computer so you can actually see a graph of your progress.  This is not only helpful in planning your recovery but inspirational because you can actually see your improvement right on the screen.
Also, know that this is NOT a linear process.  There will be advances, setbacks and plateaus...be prepared for all of them.  If you have a bad day or two, forget it and get back on track.
Lastly, you will literally have to learn how to walk again...HEEL, TOE.  This is usually done with your PT and takes a few weeks to get your rhythm down again.  Very normal.  Do NOT get down on yourself and become discouraged.  It's all completely normal.  You have a 2 1/2 pound mechanical device implanted in your body...what do you expect?  This takes time and work.  Never give up on yourself...it all comes back to you in time.
I'm writing this at almost 15 months post-op.  Some minor warmth from time to time...feel the pins and needles from the nerves only when I kneel down...zero pain, band feeling or swelling.  Clunking sound?  I think that will last forever.  The biggest problem is strengthening and balance but that's all in another discussion on Post-TKR Exercising.
So get to walking.  Crutches, cane walker at the beginning...no problem...even if it's for just 5 minutes.  You'll be walking normally in time with zero assistance...just give yourself the space to get there with no expectations or mind games.  It all works out.
Stairs?  That's in another post.  Pretty much the last big thing you have to conquer.  For now, just walk until you feel normal again.

"Unless someone has different information, I don't know of any other way of breaking down the post-op scar tissue except through PT or an MUA.  Yes, the Physical Therapy is right out of The Inquisition (I swore my therapist wore a dungeon master's cowl and had an Iron Maiden covered up with a sheet in the corner...), is extremely painful (some people take meds an hour before a session but then can't drive there), and is full of successes, setbacks and plateaus.  I went from -14 / +84 in 10 weeks @ 2x/week to -1 / +123 (the goal is 0 / +120).  I got stuck at -4 for weeks...frustrating.  But I did a lot of heel slides and squats at home too.  I started my PT 3-4 weeks post-op...wait longer and the scar tissue has had more time to build up.  Haven't heard of anyone starting sooner...anyone out there who did that?
With the MUA, you're unconscious and the docs get out whatever scar tissue they can in an attempt to give you better ROM.  The downside is that you're now dealing with another operation, open incision and post-op pain.  Personally, I'd work like hell to avoid that.  In my opinion, MUA is a last resort for people who have not had any success with PT.
This is simple: No way you'll get your ROM back by doing nothing but rest, ice and elevation at home.  Not a chance.  This takes physical manipulation by a PT to break down the scar tissue so you can walk again without a cane or a limp for the rest of your life.  Even the people who have reported great ROM numbers within a month of surgery still did the work to get it.  Maybe there's even that one in a million patient whose DNA does not allow scar tissue to form.  Who knows?  For the rest of us, it's hard and painful work...but worth it.
I did ask my PT about people in their eighties...what goals do you have for them?  He told me that 0 / +120 is not likely to be achieved by the very elderly so they focus on enough ROM and strength to get a person out of bed, to the bathroom and kitchen, and out to a car.  Pretty much self-care basics.  Different age...different standard of success.
For a PT session, they will warm you up on a bike...might take a week or two to get one full pedal rotation.  Patience...it will come.  Then there's more leg work of various types.  I loved sitting on a rolling stool and using the bad leg to push and pull me around.  Always a fun one.
Down the road, they will try and make you climb a single stair, bad leg first to engage the dead quad muscle.  No holding on to a rail, no bouncing on the good leg to pop you up there.  This is VERY hard.  Could not do it without using the rail for many weeks.  Even after PT and 6-12 months of recovery, stairs are still very difficult because of the lack of leg strength.  Only serious gym time and lots of leg presses will do that.  At home, get a set of exercise bands and do them every day!  At 14+ months, I can do two steps at a time alternate legs with no railing.  Lots of work went into that (plus residual leg strength from 45 years of hockey...so I cheated...).  Be patient.
Now for the exciting denouement.  The PT lays you on your back, puts your heel up on a block of wood and pushes down on your knee...maybe 6-10 times, each one harder than the last.  Fun, right?  Remember the chest-waxing scene from The Forty-Year-Old Virgin with Steve Carrell yelling ""Kelly Clarkson!!!.....Richard Nixon!!!""?  Yeah, something like that.  Then he lays you on your stomach with your knees just on the edge of the table.  That's it...just let the knee hang...and hang...and hang.  Gravity may be a law but it's also a b**ch!!!

"Hi, I've noticed different stages/phases in my recovery after my knee replacement surgery. The first two weeks were almost unbearable, after that the pain was still there but a little less. At 12 weeks most of my pain was gone and I noticed considerable improvement in strength, bend, etc. What has been your experience as to the different significant stages in your recovery?

"Hello, I just joined this forum for info and moral support. I had a TKR May 2nd and am 30-days post op today. I went to rehab following surgery for 2 weeks. I was doing really well with my PT and then my Mother fell and was put on life support. I was distracted and cut down on my home knee exercises to 3-5 times a week and admit that I was not feeling well for a few days and allowed myself to be lazy. I scheduled PT on Wed and cancelled as I was up all night in pain and exhausted. I plan on calling tomorrow and rescheduling my 2x week PT sessions. I am still unable to straighten my leg full and sometimes cannot stand flat in my foot. I have started taking my pain meds 1hr before I do my exercises and ice my knee immediately afterward. My question is should I be concerned cause I cannot straighten my leg? I had my other knee done about 5-6 years ago and did amazing. Somehow this time I am easily tired and the pain seems worse.

"I had bilateral knee replacement 4 months ago. My left knee has been swollen and stiff since the start, but my right knee has been great...until 3 days ago. I walk down a pretty steep set of stairs that day. Now, on the outside of my right knee, I have very sharp pain if I put any weight on the knee - which means it hurts if I walk. I'm trying to keep it elevated, but it hasn't helped. I'm limping and using my cane again. I thought maybe I just stretched a tendon.  Any ideas? Should I call my surgeon?

"Hi guys, I really need some inspiration and I feel like my life is crumbling or should I say straining and tearing. I am 22 years old and I'm one of the most active people I know. I was a dancer all my life doing breakdancing and hip hop and in the last 5 years I've found an ever growing love for body building.
Around September last year I done something to my right knee whilst I was on holiday going for a jog, being young and active I continued to train and power through hoping I'd ""walk it off"" it got to about January, I decided i need to do something about it. My GP just fed me pain killers and said just rest it. I went back 4 more times and still gave me nothing!!!. I then went out on a work night out in february and done something which I don't remember how but I got back home and before I knew it they were both swollen and throbbing at the knees. I have now not trained legs since then.
I think at the beginning I had jumpers knee which then developed into my left and when I was out i done something to my ACL in my right knee.
So that's my knees! To make matters worse... I've now got bicep tendonitis in both shoulders. I must have done this from over training my upper body due to completely stopping training my lower body for almost 4 months. I really am in a bad way, it sounds ridiculous but I've never been depressed and I feel that I'm depressed and I even have suicidal thoughts but I snap out of it immediately.
I'm working my way to get an MRI for my knees cause I know there is multiple problems and it's being rediculousy slow. Yes I admit my knees have improved massively from February but I'm still very far away to being back to where I was. Now this with my shoulders I don't know how to handle this.
I am still down the gym only doing excercises my Physio has given me and many more for both knees and shoulders.
I guess I just need some encouragement, advice, suggestions and success stories. Im young and I know I can overcome this. I'm hoping next year il look back and be incredibly proud to be back on track and learn from my mistakes.
I would very appreciate your comments below thank you.

"Most of you know that my recovery was completely halted at 8 months last October when I developed severe stenosis in my spine at L2/L3.  Had to wait until this March to get the surgery...plus the 2-month, no-activity recovery.  Including the pre-op knee pain, that's a total of EIGHTEEN MONTHS of zero exercise.  All my muscles are very tight and very weak...or so I thought.
Spine doc ordered a few PT sessions just to learn the exercises to get my back strong again without injuring all the fusion work.  PT (interestingly, the same one that did my knee) tested me out.  Yes, very, very tight and very weak in some movements.  Then he made me walk up some stairs...and that turned out OK.  I was very surprised.  No railing, no bouncing, just used my quads to do alternate steps like normal people.
Then he told me to do two steps at a time...AND I DID IT!!!!  No weakness, no railing, no bouncing, no nuttin'.  Just flew up the steps two at a time.  Like the clouds parted and I was standing in a ray of light!!!
Explanation:  Muscle memory.  The PT said that because I had such strong legs to begin with (those decades of hockey), I was able to overcome the short-term weakness with deep, underlying muscle strength.  WOOHOO!!!!  A gift from above.
So...the take away...  Lots of people wonder if PRE-op exercising will do them any good.  I don't know about quad work for just a few weeks but if you have very strong legs from years of exercise or sports, then you may experience the luck that I just encountered.  Yes, I still have a lot of work to do but this was an amazing start for me.  May not be true for everyone, but it gave me hope that my concurrent knee and spine strengthening will not require me to start completely from scratch.
I wish the same for all of you.  Stay strong, gang.  Sometimes there's a ray of light just around the next corner for you too.

"I went 13 weeks after my knee replacement surgery without using any heat on my knee. I was icing like crazy but never heat. Whenever I had asked my PT I was pretty much given the same answer, ""use ice, not heat"". My thoughts are that initially ice treatment is a no brainer but after awhile surely heat helps healing? I decided to experiment for a week. I only used ice after my stretches and once a day when I alternated ice and heat. I do 15 mins ice, then 15 mins heat, followed by 10 and 5 min intervals. In the evening mainly while watching tv I used heat. It's now a week later and I have to say my experiment was a success, I'm much improved, my ROM increased 10% and I just ""feel"" better, I'm now able to do more stretching and strength exercises without swelling. Initially when I cut back on the ice my swelling increased but after three days the opposite happened. Anyone else have experience using heat? If so, how often do you use it, etc.

"Hi guys, not posted last couple of weeks it was my mums funeral last Friday and i wanted things to settle down a bit. Thanks for the advice you gave me a couple of weeks ago, i kept getting a stabbing pain when i had been walking for a couple of minutes. i got myself really worried about it but the advice i received on here was great. My ibuprofen prescription hadnt been renewed so i reinstated that and within a day or so i felt better. If it hadnt been for this forum i would have got myself all upset and worked up. This is a great place to go when you need reassurance. I had my second physio appt today and they were really pleased with my progress. I have a 115 bend it was 110 a week ago and my leg is nearly straight. Im still in a lot of pain but i expected that with my other arthritis issues but my leg is feeling stronger. I can walk without support but am still using one crutch as my knee doesnt feel strong enough yet to go without. I have a stationery bike and the physio has said i can now use it because i really need to build up my quads but only for short spurts.
Im still elevating and icing but no more blood thinners and compression socks thank god. I would love to hear how other people were at 5 weeks and and what i can expect over next few weeks.
Has anybody used a stationery bike to improve quad strength.
Thanks.

"After reading that at one time it was recommended that anyone who had a TKR should be covered on antibiotics for life when having hygienist work on their mouths or more invasive dental work, but then this wasn't recommended anymore because the overuse of antibiotics became such a problem, and then someone recommended antibiotics for the first three months after knee replacement because there was more blood flow to the knee in that period, it got me wondering.  Firstly, we're not really told the importance of dental hygiene especially if we have  TKR.  Having said that, it seems that it's not the bugs found in the mouth that seem to cause most knee infections!    So why were antibiotics being used at all?  IF someone was inclined to get bleeding when going to the dentist, then I wondered if it was worth them using something like the stronger corsodyl for a few days before going to the dentist to reduce any risk. 
It's one of these things with conflicting advice over the years, just like everything else!

My physio recommended using ankle floats to increase resistance and that works the leg very well. Also I understand that working the muscles in water works them in a particularly all over type of way, which cannot be achieved out of water due to gravity! I started doing about forty minutes of exercises and 20 mins of the crawl a few weeks back and it really is the highlight of my week. Completely exhausted for the rest of the day but so worth it.

"I saw one of my surgeons this evening concerning my knee bend and the problem with the heel while using the bicycle. This is what I was told: my knee only bends to 100 - I thought that it was higher since the last measurement was 115. At one point back in December it was bending to 118. The doctor wants me to go see one of his associates for the possibility of performing arthroscopic surgery to remove the adhesions and also do a manipulation. However, I am almost 8 months post TNR and I have Fibromyalgia. Has anyone has these procedures done after 3 months. If you have, please let me know. The doctor the suggested this has been my doctor for a few years, but he was not the one who did my TNR. I had my TNR at the Mayo Clinic because I reside in Florida.

"If you could only give one (1) piece of advice for people recovering from a total knee replacement what would it be? 
My advice would be to be prepared for a long, slow recovery and to not get frustrated. One thing I notice from all these postings is that a huge percentage of people feel they should be doing better than they are (including me) and more than a few are worried something is wrong. Statistics show that 95% of patients are delighted with their recovery at 12 months so unless you're very unlucky, you're doing just fine. Just continue to plod along.
What is your #1 tip? (Just one please)

BUT I only take it at night on worst flare ups, and give it a break every five days otherwise it stops working.  But it does help me sleep through.  Are others on painkillers, and do they work?  What worked best for me was flexiseq cream rather than tablets for the pain during the day.  Anything else that others can recommend?

"One subject we haven't touched on yet is the impact TKR has on our mental health.
It can take away, even if temporarily, our independence & our dignity!
I must admit to feeling that I was a burden to my husband in the first month, probably, after TKR. I feel that for most women, who have worked all their lives, cared for the home & family, the robbing of independence is up there with the pain in making this recovery hard (dignity goes when you have babies!!). Yes it IS usually temporary but can last for a long time as we have heard. Post op depression is real, but tends to be pushed to one side. Should we be given more information & help to deal with the issues depression brings? In none of the literature I was given did it mention how I may FEEL in myself after TKR. Should it have been?
That isn't to say men don't find this hard too, but given the role women have in the home, as generally speaking the main carer for the family, it is hard to accept the role reversal.
Do you think women are more prone to feeling like this or are men, who are the 'hunter gatherers' usually hard at work all week, the ones who are more affected due to being unable to escape the home for the office?
Has this affected you? Or do you think it nonsense?

"Robin and Jan have both mentioned that leg muscles can be weak before TKR so need to be built up after.  Some say weights are a good idea and some say not.  My own view is that since obesity raises the chance of wearing out knee joints early, then squats with weights do too, and I've read studies about deep squats frequently done, being a reason for knees wearing out BUT I do appreciate that legs have got to be strong to support those knees.  My hospital gave me exercises to do BEFORE the TKR to strengthen legs.  As Robin said, many people don't lead an active lifestyle before TKR because pain has limited them, so there is a weakness and it does sound a very good idea to reduce that weakness before the op.  I'm wondering if this is what helped me so much - as well as the hospital exercises I'd been doing the exercise bike for years, so legs were pretty strong at the time of the op.  Are all other hospitals stressing this point, or is pre-op condition something that gets neglected?

"I read and listen to all your suggestions & answers and know this is a long process. However, I still feel worried with my bend. It will be 6 weeks on Tue post TKR. I am in the U.K. and have visited the NHS physio once per week. The Physio is in a different centre to my operation as it was done in another town ( given choice on NHS). My physio has not really done  exercises with me just shows me what to do that week and checks my bend and straight leg. I do physio 4 times a day alone and rest ice and elevate. I do everything I am told and really push myself. I have bought a pedal machine and do 5 mins three times a a day but my bend is only 80 and straight still only + 10. I swell a lot and can only sleep on my back. My knee still feels like it has a vice around it and like concrete. I still use one crutch and still not driving. I try not to compare myself but most people are doing better. My pain is fine and I am taking paracetamol and 15 mg Codine at night. I see my consultant on 5th June and really want to avoid a manipulation / scar tissue operation. I think walking more might help but I am alone in the day and scared of walking outside alone. How do I get off the crutch and get this knee bending more? I am only 50 and need my other knee done asap. Consultant was planning to do them 12 weeks apart. I feel like a failure and I am getting pressure to return to work ( teacher).

"I've tried a few strange things to help aid or speed up my knee replacement recovery. I initially had trouble with pain and after the Dr switched me to several pain meds finally tried (successfully) with some Asian herb. Apparently, it's so out of ""left field"" I'm not allowed to mention it here. 
My Physical therapists wanted to tape me up with some black tape that made me look like an octopus. Once was enough with that. After seeing some of the therapy exercises I went out and bought some Biofreeze, a pulling strap and a big ball. I looked at leasing a CPM machine and a recumbent bike but ended up with neither. I already have a ""unicycle type"" and a road bicycle.
I've never been a big vitamin guy but I bought a bunch of vitamins that promise to ""speed up recovery"". I don't know if they work or not but I take about 10 in the morning and 10 at night now just in case.
My freezer is loaded with about eight new ice packs which I rotate depending on my mood.
Probably the weirdest thing I did was to buy some ""soda ash crystals"" to strap on my swollen knee before bed. The stuff looks and is similar to salt. I think they use it as a pool chemical. I came across that beauty when I saw an Australian PT video that promised it would help with the swelling in three days. He even showed how to wrap it around the knee. I tried that for five days but as expected........
What ""different things"" have you done or tried since your surgery?

"Hi so two weeks ago I was squatted down in work when I went to stand up there was a loud crack and I couldn't weight bear or move my leg. After being in a&e for 7 hours I was told it could possibly be a snapped ligament or torn cartilage. So Dr back plastered my leg gave me painkillers told me to come bak to hospital on the 15th.
Had appointment Monday OS was shocked knee is still locked. He is convinced it's torn cartilage so ordered urgent MRI which I had done today. So now have to wait for surgeon to get in touch with results.
Has anyone had similar or is there anyone who can suggest how I unlock my knee. The pain and weakness of it all is finally getting to me so any advice would be really appreciated thanks.

"When I was in hospital I insisted on elevating my leg. The other two ladies in my section were both hip replacements so obviously they were not elevating their leg!
I would like to know other people's experience of this...I ask because while I was allowed to do what I wanted, it was mentioned that ""the physio's don't like people to put a pillow under the leg"". My reply was just that I was ensuring the leg was straight so it was fine. It was not a problem, and no one put any pressure on me to do differently...But I was surprised I was left to my own initiative regarding bearing in mind
How much elevating helps... were you encouraged to elevate your operated leg in hospital?

"The exercises I was told to do post op are pretty minimal really that don't involve much in the way of strengthening, but concentrate more on THE BEND!:-))))  I know some on here are going to gyms, with instructors, and some feel it's very important to seriously work out after the op.  I can see that we need strong muscles to support the knee but when I went for my six week check the physio was very surprised at the strength I had in my legs.  Now, all I've been doing for a while now is up to ten minutes on the recumbent bike and 10 minutes on the treadmill, leaning heavily on arms.  At the moment I've built up to 7 or 8 minutes on the bike and treadmill, but my intention is not to go more than 10 minutes on each.  I'd like to be able to also do a few minutes or so on the cross trainer when the other knee is done to improve core strength.  I doubt I'll be walking miles every day, ever, but normal walking will do me fine.  I'm not planning on being an athlete, but would like to be able to get up and down from a chair without leaning on arms and also go up stairs and down, without leaning on handrail.  That's my goals.  Something I read in several studies was that one of the reasons they prefer people to be a bit older before knee replacements is because they're not so active, so the knees last longer.  So, the question is, if you don't need the extra strength for work or a hobby you really want to do, can you exercise to the  point of wearing the knee out prematurely unnecessarily?  It was reading the study about the Koreans loosening the glue with keep doing deep squatting that made me think about this.  Reading that obesity wears the knee out faster - the extra weight on it - how good is weight training - pros and cons ????  Questions, questions...

"Today, Thursday May 18, 2017 marks the 13th week after my Knee Replacement surgery. I have to admit I was a bit naive as to what to expect with my recovery. I'd previously had a hip replaced and mistakenly figured recovery would be similar. Not so.
One of my surprises was the disagreements as to how to best proceed post op to achieve a quick, successful rehab. Doctors, Nurses, Physical Therapists, fellow patients, friends...seem to contradict each other, all very confident their way is the correct way.
I'll speak of my experience and confusion. I came to the decision I needed to stop ""googling"" for answers because the answers, opinions, etc., always left me with more questions.
I was shocked by the amount of pain from this surgery and the efforts to control it. For pain meds I was initially given Percocet, that seemed to work ok but my blood pressure kept dropping and I became dizzy when standing. Eventually after trying something else I can't remember, I was prescribed 50 mg of Tramadol. That stopped the dizziness but did little to curb the pain. Even after leaving the Hospital I had difficulty controlling the pain, that was until I accidentally (from reading someone's story) came across a controversial, natural herb that did the trick.
The biggest confusion has been with the right way to handle Physical Therapy and rehab exercises. Even the Therapists disagree on this. Some believe the aggressive, no pain no gain approach is the best, others feel that does more harm than good and could actually impede recovery. I had four different Therapist working with me, two were ""aggressive"", two were ""gentle"". Across the Internet from what I can see, opinions are split on this. I've had lots of advice but at the time I'm writing this I'm still unsure of the best approach. One Doctor or Therapist will list the best exercises to do at home and the next will say half of them are dangerous. I've read where walking is good for you but I've also read where walking increases swelling and should be avoided during early recovery.
Then there's the icing and elevation. Sounds simple but for how long, how often? Yesterday someone who should know said I need to ice for at least an hour and repeat 4-5 times a day. I'd never heard that before, most professionals say 15-20 minutes.
For me I'm doing the gentle stretches with the occasional ""nudge"", I ice, elevate for about 20 minutes 4-5 times and walk about a mile every day but who knows? Only time will tell. I think most of us reach our destination in the end, the only question is, how long it took and how much difficulty we had.

But (there is always a but) it seems to have stopped. My PT is very pleased with my progress but I thought by now things would be better. My knees are still very stiff and they feel really full (if that makes sense ). I guess I am curious as to how others feel or felt at this stage.

One article I read said to get up and down in a bath 'normally' you needed 135.  But I just found a useful bit in the 'orthopaedics and trauma journal' online - scopic ROM in a PS knee is an average of 115° and a maximum of 145°. This functional range is adequate ... ROM after knee replacement.  - That seems a fairly good guide!  It went on to say in climbing stairs and rising from a chair (guess that depends on height of chair though!) 95 degrees are needed.

"I had a left TKR on 3/7/16 and a right TKR on 31/11/16. I exercise and have good bend and straightening on both knees, and, unless i over do it I can walk without pain ( just the usual clicking and clonking you get with a knee replacement but you ignore over time) However I cannot walk upstairs, downstairs or tackle any slope without considerable pain. I have had to give up my part time job of 15 years because my progress is so slow I have even moved my bedroom downstairs because of the pain of trawling up and downstairs. When I last saw the consultant he said either my ligaments have not got strong enought to get my kneecap in position or sometimes the knee cap does not like rubbing against the implant and he may have to go in and put plastic backings on my kneecaps!!! Another op Aghhh!. He has suggested  waiting until my second knee replacement is a year old in November and then having a CT-SPECT scan (whatever that is). I have asked him if there is anything else i can do to aid my recovery and he said no, he said if I exercise and it hurts, to stop!!! I do water aerobics twice a week and try to push myself although I don't do anything that hurts, for a few days afterwards I am in quite a bit of pain but how can I progress if i don't push myself a bit? Also am I damaging my kneecaps if they are not aligned and I carry on exercising. I am so frustrated that even though I have gone through the pain of the ops i am really no better off. I am going to Tuscany  this June but cannot do things like  visit the Iffuzi in Florence because apparently  there are lots of steps involved and the lifts are only for wheelchair users, and as for the tower of Pisa, don't even go there!!! it may seem trivial but I thought my life would be better afterwards and these are the things i was looking forward to doing. Has anyone else had this trouble? Should I be asking for a scan sooner to get this sorted? I would be grateful for your thoughts x Jan

"Folks
I haven't been on here for a while. My last posts were all ""Mrs. Job"" posts as Chico and I joked.
On top of my quad palsy I developed a peptic ulcer, tooth abscess and severe shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis from over use of the arm to compensate for the weak leg (changing positions; pressing on the elbow to get up and grip on walker).
Lost my job. You get the picture.
So, back to business. Finally starting walking on my own 2 weeks ago. Which is about 5 months - I am actually about 5 months and two weeks now. Couple of times per day, now most of the day. Outside I still use the walker.
Don't know how much is fear of leaving the walker (security blanket) behind because I had to use it so long because of the quad palsy). I feel very unsafe, limp and the walking doesn't feel natural (I seem to inadvertently overcompensate with raising my hip when I walk. How long did it take you to walk strongly and feeling secure?
My pt told me to use a sleeve over the knee to help the brain recognize the knee because of the disruption in nerves.
A week ago I finally mastered going UP the stairs. Painful. How long were you doing up before you could do going down? I feel like it is going to be exponentially harder going down normally.
The pt (which I had to stop ($$$) told me not to overdo it. Yet I feel walking the first few weeks on my own and climbing the stairs up will automatically come with pain that will eventually decrease???
Any helpful advice and your experience would be great!!!

"Hi all-
I had my knee replaced last July- the first 3 months I was ok. My Oct appt- I let my Dr know my knee was giving and I would almost fall. He gave me another 3 months off and said it's takes time. Jan came and I went back to work on light duty- in pain still. I told him it's still feels loose and keeps on giving out about once a week. He told me that the spacer maybe loose and maybe needs to be replaced and my next appt was in July.
In March I saw his PA, still in pain. I asked his PA if they can insert a scope and look around to see why my knee was still in pain and still giving out. He told me they have to wait a full year to do a bone scan and can't do a scope check. Of course I did not listen- I scheduled an appt with the primary surgeon at the same office- he saw me within a week- told me he will go in with a scope, look around and replace the loose spacer if needed. All that happend a week later- April 26-2017.
I'm still in pain- but I am positive I will get better.
Has anybody went thorough a loose spacer revision less than a year? What's your story? Any support is great. This has been awful 10 months.

Its 3 weeks since my op today and finally i feel like i have turned a corner. i had my staples removed yesterday albeit 5 days later than it should have been, it was painful but its such a relief that their out and i feel so much better. I was really worried about my bend and whether i was doing enough exercises and it was really getting me down thinking i wasnt doing enough but i had my first physio appointment yesterday and they were really pleased with my progress. My bend is 110 which i couldnt believe i thought it was so much less than that. He was really happy with everything else and gave me a few more exercises to do to build up my quads and i see him next week. The best advice he gave me was what a few of you on here told me to do as well which was it is important to do the exercises but not to the point where you are pushing yourself too much and your in agony, let your body tell you when its had enough. This is great advice because recovering from a knee replacement is massive and we have to give ourselves time and not expect for us to be back to normal in a few weeks. Im 3 weeks in now and it is just now starting to get easier. Im sleeping through most of the night now and the pain is getting easier but im still on strong meds which i want to start to reduce soon and whilst i still have a hell of a long way to go i finally see light at the end of the tunnel.
So for those of you who are about to have or have just had a knee replacement and are feeling like the pain will never go away believe me it does get easier and keep using this forum it will give you so much support and encouragement when you need it most. It did for me
Take care

"Hi All, looking for advice!
6 years ago I injured my knee - my foot twisted sideways, while my knee went forward and hit the ground, hard. So there was both a twisting, stretching and impact all at once. Not a good recipe for a knee. Following the injury, I was never able to run more than 3km without severe and sharp pain in the inside of my knee. Today, it's not much different, it feels consistently weak, and sometimes locks up during the day. I can run no more than 4-5km without severe pain, and this is usually only if I'm stretching every km or so. At the time of the injury, which was 2011, the doctors suggested surgery, which I declined, as I was able to continue with most other sports without too much discomfort. That said, after 6 years, I would really like get it strong and pain free again, when running moderate distances (10-20k). I don't need to be an ultra marathon runner, but I deeply miss running. Today's doctors seem to resort to 1 of 2 solutions; surgery or change of lifestyle. At 30 years old, I don't want to accept either of those, for ""mild to moderate"" injury. Diagnosis was: 
Moderate degeneration of medial meniscus without gross tear
Mild degeneration of lateral meniscus without gross tear
Possible mild partial injury of ACL and proximal PCL 
Does anyone have any suggestions for treatment, other than surgery?

"Hi All,
Well 22 weeks post TKR back to work full time now and coping better but knee swelling to be expected. Managing that the rehab exercise and even the tiredness now ( tiredness is normal in the NHS LOL !!! ) RA niggles controlled too.
However now getting a nagging lower back pain goes after a night sleep but comes on as the day goes on. I do walk a lot im my job probably 2-5 miles a day. It does not radiate down my leg and have had sacro -iliac pain years ago after a gardening strain. This is not the same and feels like a nagging  inflammed toothache.  Its not so bad on my days off when not walking as much. I am wondering if anyone else has had this problem and if its to do with tmy new gait post TKR?? Probably see a physio or Chiropracter to see if itmis an alignment  problem. My extension is still at only -9  but bend fime  but I do not limp.
Seeing my surgeon tomorrow so will mention it to him.
Happy rehab all Jan

"I really need some help/support/advice.
I was a very active 37 yo/male up until I started getting some pretty serious inner right knee pain the past few years. A few of the doctors I saw recommended microfracture procedure, but most said the cartilage defect was much too large for this procedure.
In 2005, I had a loose body removed through arthroscopic surgery.
I decided to go through with the OATS procedure in August 2016. Here are the exact pre-op notes from the DR:
1. Chronic painful right knee, large medial femoral condyle osteochondritis dissecans lesion with cyst formation.
2. Chronic painful right knee loose body formation.
The exact lesion was measured at 23mm by 14mm
This brings to me to May of 2017.
I went through the PT and the pain of surgery and finally built my muscles back up.
My major concern is that I'm having equal to/greater pain in the exact spot the OATS procedure was performed. I called my doctor and he suggested having a new MRI on June 6th, 2017 to see what is going on.
I guess my question is, am I being too hasty to jump to the conclusion that the OATS procedure has failed?
My doctor previously said the next step is to use cadaver cartilage, if this OATS procedure didn't work. It is very disheartening and down right depressing to still be experiencing the same pain. I currently cannot run or play with my 2 kids and have another on the way in 2 weeks.
I'd just like to be normal again, although I know this may not be possible.
Any suggestions/support/advice/personal experiences which I can draw from to figure out the next step?
Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this.

"I love our sharing info &how it all helps us. I waited to post this so i could give full scoop. I've had the all the screams,tears,pain and aggravation as we all have had along the road to recovery. I was better off than most after a bilateral pkr as walker was gone at 3wks, driving at 4wks. Pushed myself through some incedibly painful scar tissue breakups with the help of an exceptionally well trained PT. DESPITE incredible flexion and extension- right was 150+ flex/full extension and left almost 150 w/full extension. I can sit in my camping(backpack) chair thats 8inches off the ground! I KEPT HAVING PAIN along the medial/inner part of ridge of patella on left knee. VERY tender to touch when flexed 30°. Could squat to chair, couldn't push up enough w left knee to get out wo help. Twisting/pivot aggravate it. The pain was increasing and unrelieved by cortisone shot at 5mo. I could walk 2miles in 45min then bike peddling for an hour NO pain. I rtnd to work for a month lite duty 8hr days.
Results: ARTHROSCOPY done today. Could not see any scar tissues BUT found BONE SPURS,regrowth of bone causing inflammation. Could not find anything else so stated, ""lets hope this does it!""
One week short of 6 months. He said bend, move, rest,ice. Keep going. This is the first arthroscopic procedure of three i am not swollen and painful. Maybe after the knee surgery i have a new definition of ""swollen &painful!"" Haha. But i walked up n down some stairs then iced. No pain meds since surgery. Was sent home 1.5hrs after hour long procedure w/general anesthesia.
I was originally terrified of another procedure and NOT ready for more pain &swelling. Said prayers, had friends pray. Just goes to show, WE ARE NOT ONLY ALL DIFFRRENT but our OWN BODY'S react different each time. I'll give update after PT on Monday. After all, we ALL know how one day we're happy as clams and the next we can howling like a wolf on a full moon, lol.
Thanks all. Hope this was helpful.

"Something that has puzzled me - there seems to not be any concern about the quality of bone (as in osteoporosis) before TKRs.  Does it not matter what the bones are like, or is it a case of 'if it needs doing, it needs doing' so it's irrelevant?  Has anyone been asked about this aspect?

"I had TKR March 1, 2017 and after PT 3x a week for four months I was unable to reach 90 degrees. Dr did MUA after 6 weeks and under manipulation my knee reached 120 degrees. I'm still experiencing a lot of pain with therapy and after 4 weeks I can still only reach 90 degrees with assistance. My workable ROM is around 70 degrees. My knee remains warm to touch and is tight and stiff. And now I have a limp. Is anyone else experiencing problems with ROM, tightness and stiffness around the knee joint? I still do therapy 3 times a week but I seem to be regressing.

"Hi, I was a runner in the army and the years of running in boots have had its toll. I had micro fracture surgery just over 2 years ago, but the pain in left knee is horrendous. I went to see a new registrar last week who said my knee cap was gone, looking at xray confirmed that the locking is due to the left and right side of knee are bone on bone but I seem to have a little cartilage in the centre. He said at 49 I'm too young, in the mean time keep off stairs, hills, don't stand too long and limit walking! I'm actually annoyed I didn't request to see the consultant as my right knee is hurting at times, plus I'm getting pain in my hip which I have no doubt is due to my knee. I now walk on my outer foot, so when standing still my posture forces my feet over so my large toe is raised off the floor. Has anyone been here? Why is it not good to get a new knee at 49? I'm worried it will be a new hip to at this rate, any thoughts advice welcomed

"A Google search led me to this site. Just thought I'd see how many have had multiple manipulations? I had my tkr in July of 2016. I had previously had four other surgeries including 2 scopes and 2 fully opened operations. A Bi-compartmental replacement and an ACI procedure. (Autologous chondrocyte implantation) I knew something wasn't right within a day or two after the tkr as I couldn't straighten my leg. Doctor said it was typical and with therapy it would improve. It didn't. I had an inpatient mua in October and I felt better for a day or two. That was about it. Within two weeks at the end of pt stretching, the straightest the therapist could get me with a lot of force was 17 degrees. I had a scope in January where the doctor said he removed a lot of scar tissue. Again, I only had improvement for a short time. At this point, my leg feels like it's fairly straight, or I've gotten use to it. I can only bend it to about 85-90 degrees though. I had a second manipulation on Thursday. Felt good for about a day, but I can tell that it's already stiffening up. I had physical therapy a few hours after the manipulation and it looked promising. By the time I had therapy on Friday I was already considerably more limited. I'm wondering if there's anyone else out there that has had similar issues and if there are any recommendations. While searching Google, it would appear that the condition is arthrofibrosis. There's only a handful of doctors in the US that specialize in it and of course none of them are anywhere near me. Ideas?

"2 weeks ago I fell quite badly and have twisted my knee. 3 people who were around said they heard a popping sound which suggests ACL (which I have stretched previously), however I am able to walk pretty well (I have been given crutches for support). I can also fully extend my leg with minimal pain. When i try and bend my leg, it only goes so far before it stops and if I try and push it with my hand it sort of locks itself and is severely painful, to relieve it I have to stretch my leg out and it slightly clicks/pops.
Also it has remained swollen and keeps getting warmer than the other knee every so often.
I am waiting on an MRI scan which will obviously give me a correct diagnosis however I was wondering if anybody might be able to point me in the right direction given my symptoms and movement abilities.

"I had a total knee replacement on my left knee on Feb 6, 2017. Rehab went well and I was at 115 degrees bend and 0 degrees straight, when one day I started to get up from sitting and my leg wouldn't straighten out. It felt like a rubbery, squishy, grinding feeling. I can eventually straighten my leg, but from around the 35 degree bend until it's straight, I can feel and hear a creaking, rubbing sound. I reported this to my surgeon and she said it could be scar tissue. My right knee was to be replaced the next week, on April 24. She told me she would manipulate the left knee while I was out, which she did. That didn't help at all. The problem continued and was getting worse. I went last week and she took 4 X-rays, which she said all looked normal. She gave me a cortisone shot to help with the pain. It helped a little, but the grinding, rubbery feeling is still there. I go back next Friday to see what comes next. She still thinks it's scar tissue. She said she may go in with a scope to look around and cut through scar tissue, if she finds any. The surgery on the right knee went well and rehab is progressing as well as possible, considering the shape of my left knee. I was wondering if anyone else has had this happen or has ideas as to what it could be.

?I am going to therapy now, it is not helping.  One thing I'm thankful of is I'm not depressed...thank god.
?Please, if anyone else is going through this same thing and your surgery was a few years ago and you have Fibromyalgia share your story.  The doctors I've seen blames this on Fibromyalgia and I don't agree.  I think it is soft tissue or/and nerve issues.

"I got knee arthroscopy surgery on May 2ND 2017 from my Orthopedic surgeon to repair my torn ACL with my hamstring graft and the doctor removed part of my meniscus. It had been working well. I didn't have any pain after the surgery so I didn't take any pain medication. I torn both in March 25th and had start eating clean afterwards, did going to gym and did the therapy. All I was doing was trying to find info as much as I can before approaching the surgery date. I am lucky I didn't have any bruising and pain afterwards and walking with 2 crutches since day 1 after surgery. 1st day I walked about 30min x 3 times. 2nd day 45min x 4 times 3rdday 40minx3 times 4thday 1.5hr x 3times. I felt so much better and I can put weight on my left leg. I'm doing the therapy and RICE everytime I rest. It took so much to try to recover. But the swelling seems to stay the same. I measured everyday and it's between 40 cm 42 cm 38 cm. Each is 6 cm over and under the knee. Is that another approaching for reduce the swelling? I'm not a medication type of person. But I'm open to natural healing. All my food is no sodium no preservatives no sugar raw food vegetarian. I was wondering if ice heat ice will help too since it's pass 96hours post surgery.

"I am a 73 year old female living in Manchester UK and have had both my knees replaced.  The first replacement took place two and a half years ago and the second took place six months ago.  Healing has gone well.  However, two months ago I started experiencing pain on the front of my knee - sharp enough to limp slightly again.   It is an intermittent paid and some days it it not there at all!   I made an appointment to see the surgeon who indicated that there is arthritis on the patella and that is why I am experiencing the pain.  I also have front knee pain in the first knee which was replaced two and a half years ago, although not as sharp as the current one.  The surgeon has suggested that I leave it until later in the year when he will have both knees xrayed and see what the situation is at that time.  He has told me to continue with the exercises to continue to build up the quad muscles to support my knees.   Before I had my first knee replaced the surgeon had suggested that I may need patella resurfacing as well as the joint replacement but, when the operation took place, it was decided that it was not necessary to do the patella resurfacing.   I would be really interested on any comments which people have who have experienced patella resurfacing, especially if this was carried out on a separate occasion from the knee replacement operation.

Eventually the MRI results came back and the consultant said everything appeared fine (I was shocked as by now my leg was very weak from not being able to use it due to stiffness and pain - the physio said I had lost a lot of muscle mass too) the consultant said he couldnt do anything and told me to continue physio. When I went to my next session the physio suggested that there was something on the MRI but when I said the doc said there wasnt he quickly backtracked and said my knee was fine. He did a test to see how strong my leg muscles were and despite the muscles being weak he said that I should just continue a few exercises at home and I would be fine.
So, a little confused, left hoping it would get better on its own. I quit hockey and stopped strenuous exercise to help rest it.

"After fantastic support on here and my most positive morning so far, I attended my second physio appointment. I have been doing my physio religiously but have not felt much improvement (3 weeks today since op), I have been elevating and using ice cuff, I have been taking my medication despite some nausea and I felt so positive today. 
My knee bend bend has gone from 80(Hospital) to 60 last week to 50 this week. My physio is only one year into her career and called for a second opinion who said I was not presenting like someone three weeks. She said I should see my consultant asap and may need a manipulation. I was overcome with anxiety. The first physio said to give it another week before I ring consultant and massage knee as very swollen. Due to the knee length stocking all my fluid starts at my knee. In my area apparently you cannot get thigh length stockings. 
I am shattered and she also suggested physio every two hours. What do I do? I thought it was early days but they felt I should be doing so much better. I am also still not lifting my leg which I am really worrried about. I feel back to square one again. Should I ring consultant or give it another week?

?I'm now at 7 weeks post op, started with a lot of pain and swelling and lack of flexion. Extension is allright. Pain lessening but swelling still bad. I have lipoedema so pain and swelling of legs happens a lot anyway.
?So, physio has given me homework before I see surgeon. I am doing them, trying not to overwork and icing and elevating.
?But the hamstrings are so sore and hurting in the night now when I never had this previously. Is this to be expected?
?I don't really want an injury or a MUA. I think I am doing the moves right and how I was shown. I have always been prone to injuries and struggled to get fit. Going to the gym was one of the things that seemed to set off the decline of my knees even though I had proper instruction - I believe this can be worse due to the lipoedema. Any advice welcomed as I cannot get appt with PT now for 10 days.

""Sophomore Syndrome"" is a REAL THING in medical schools.  The students start to read about all these diseases and then convince themselves that they have every one of them!  Don't do that!!!  Stop Googling everything...you'll drive yourself crazy.  Yes, be a well-informed medical consumer, be able to talk to your doctor on a knowledgeable level but don't try to become an expert in human physiology from the Internet.  Not going to happen.
One more thing...
STOP POSTING MRI PICTURES!!!
No one here is going to diagnose you from a tiny jpeg!!!  Only an orthopedic surgeon can do that from the HIGH-RESOLUTION original films.  Plus, we are NOT doctors!!!  Spend the money on an office visit.

"Just wondering here.... those who have had difficulty lifting the leg (straight leg raises) after a TKR - have they been inclined to have stronger or weaker quad muscles before the op?  Just wondering if there is any correlation here.  Maybe strength of muscles before the op has nothing to do with it though!

"Can anyone help? Maybe someone had a case with arthrofibrosis. 
I am 30 years old. I had  MCL and muscle tear. After surgery, my surgeon did not want me to bend leg for 6 weeks. I started rehab only 6 weeks after the surgery. Now I am 12 weeks post operation, I can bend only to 70 degrees after the therapy. The therapy is really painful, ( I lost my voice several times because of screaming)  the lower pouch under patella is swollen and it is not fluid, it is hard. My therapist said that I have arthrofibrosis, plus I have a bad muscle atrophy. I can't sleep throughout the night, the leg gets stiff in the mornings, and during the cold weather. The therapist recommended today MUA or arthroscopy. She said that if I have not reached 90 degrees by this time I should consider MUA. She said that I most likely recover faster after MUA, otherwise the recovery will be long and painful. I don't know what to do. I have been depressed for the last month because of the lack of sleep/pain and starting to lose faith in the recovery. Should I consider MUA if I the therapy is so painful? 
I will appreciate any advice.

That aside, in the last few days I've noticed a good amount of pain behind my knee. In addition my knee is stiff moving forward.

I am a dancer and need to be as fit as possible for a show coming up. I've been to an orthopaedic doctor and he said there's nothing major he can find but obviously if its giving me pain there must be a problem.

"I had a septic knee removed on February 24, 2017 and have had an antibiotic spacer and a donjoy brace ever since. Yesterday my knee or whatever is there started to hurt more than usual and I noticed today that it was swollen on the left inside part. It's right next to the dial on the brace but not under it. I don't know if the cement spacer can desintegrate after this much time or I possibly strained it trying to adjust the bittom strap which caused significant pain at the time I reached down. Can either of these things cause swelling or could it be something else? I have an appointment Monday to tap the knee and see if it's clear of infection and ready for a replacement knee. This will be the 7th surgery on my right knee so the ligaments and tendons have to be somewhat compromised.

"Hi all, I am making this enquiry for my partner who is in no fit state to do it himself.
4 weeks ago he was getting into a cab and tore his medial meniscus. The MRI shows that it is a straight tear with no overlaps or anything sinister and the doctors are saying he shouldn't be in much pain.
He is in so much pain, he can barely sit still, he can't bear weight on it, and just having clothing or a blanket touch it is incredibly painful. 
He is 62 but up until the injury has always been healthy even with being overweight, and has never had any other injuries to the knee. The MRI also shows that he has stage 4 Tri-Compartmentalised Osteo-Arthritis, but this wasn't causing him any trouble before the tear so we are pretty sure it is the tear that is giving him grief.
my question is, did your tear cause you significant pain like this? He is on Endone as well as a slow release form of Oxynorm, Panadeine Forte and Voltaren, and while this takes the edge off the pain, he is still suffering terribly. I just don't know what else he can do and its at least 4 weeks before we can get an initial consultation with the specialist, and then its a 12 month wait if they decide he needs surgery.
Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated
Thanks,
Andrea

"I'm 32 years old, and I had my knee kicked in a couple years ago, and have undergone two left knee surgeries. How common of a surgery is this? My name pain is worse now, than before both surgieries. Prolonged standing is miserable. After a couple hours, I have to sit down. If I go 2-3 hours without sitting, I can barely walk the next day. The doctor who performed both surgeries, is telling me everything is normal…
 1st Surgery – Arthroscopic chondroplasty of the apex & lateral facet of the patella. Arthroscopic extensor tendon realignment w/arthroscopic lateral retinacular release & arthroscopic medial retinacular plication w/percutaneous multiple suture placement & arthroscopic knot tying technique.
 2nd Surgery – Arthroscopic assisted medial patellofermoral ligament reconstruction using semitendinosus allograft & internal fixation, i.e. Cayenne aperfix anchor for femur & Gryphon anchors on the patella. Arthroscopic assisted distal extensor tendon realignment by performing a tibial tubercle osteotomy with medicalization & internal fixation, i.e. three 6.0 cancellous screws w/washers. Medical retinacular plication, i.e. proximal extensor tendon realignment
Is this normal? I don't know how serious of a surgery they were.

"Last night, for the first time since the TKR we went out for a meal with the family.  Living in a bungalow means I've not done steps and because of knees haven't done steps for over 10 years but with the increased exercise and increasing confidence in the new knee, we went to a restaurant that had two lots of four steps.  I managed fine!  The new knee is wonderful!  I'm now able to do my bike at a level seven resistance - before only went up to two or three and am pushing to get closer and closer to the pedals because I figure this is good for the knee that will be done late summer too.  Am just about as close as it's physically possible to get now, with no problem.  Service was slow in the restaurant and we were there sitting for about two plus hours.  When I stood up both knees were stiff but the operated one eased within a few steps.  It was the unoperated one giving me the grief, but hey, what's new LOL! 
I wondered if the sitting, and probably more swelling would affect the bend last night (yes, still did that when we got home) but got to 136, so well pleased the way that's going.  Aiming for 140, but we'll see.
I feel fitter and stronger than I have for about 20 years, already!  This is so good!  A few weeks ago I was feeling weak and unbalanced as I walked but now feeling so much better.  I think part of it is confidence in my new knee.
I just want to encourage those feeling that the time has come for a new knee but are really worried.  I put these ops off for so long because I was worried about 'something going wrong' but then once I decided I was going for it, decided it wasn't going to 'go wrong' and it's been the best thing I could have ever done.  Can't wait for the next one now!  I'm 67 but this has taken years off me!  Before, I felt like an 80 year old, struggling to walk so much.  Yes, the other knee is still bad but one good knee is so much better than no good knees!
Just a tip, that MIGHT help others waiting for a knee op.  EVERY morning (or in the night if I have to get up for a wee) I NEVER get up out of bed without straightening and stretching the unoperated knee and did this with both knees for years.  If I got up without doing this the knee would give way with the most awful pain, but just stretching and straightening it first made so much difference.  It might just help someone else!  Wishing you all a pain free happy day!

"Hi about to have an MUA some 7 months after TKR as sadly I cannot fully straighten my leg and walking is very difficult. As soon as I put weight on my operated leg I get tremendous pain throughout my knee. in fact I have been told that I walk from my hip, rather than my iknee.  However I am able to bend my knee when sitting, but not when I walk.  What should I expect after this MUA - will I need one to one  physio every day to begin with.  I have been exercising regularly, go to Aqua gym, try to use an exercise bike regularly, although this is sometimes quite difficult for me.  It is so difficult to get answers out of the NHS Consultant.  He seems to think that he might use a knee brace on me - has anyone else had this fitted after a MUA and did it help. Any replies would be appreciated.

"OK...so it's really over 13 months but the guy was busy...lots of ""installation"" work on his plate.
From the Doc:
- Perfect ROM ( 0 / +135 ).  Told him I wanted 140; he was skeptical that the number could be attained with the artificial joint.  Guess I'll never sit back on my heels again (that's 161).
- Perfect alignment, no wobbles, scar healed.
- Cautions: No running, treadmills (elliptical only), skiing, HOCKEY (no kidding).  Stay away from anything that causes impact to the knee...like twisting, jumping and landing hard playing basketball.  I posted a list previously...he concurred.
- Clicking, popping clunking...  Bad news campers...probably permanent.  His exact words: ""What do you expect?  It's metal on plastic!"".  It may quiet down but I don't expect it to...neither should you.  Small price to pay for walking without pain.
- Not happy with my quads but understood the condition because of my stenosis midway through the recovery plus the recent spine surgery.  Told me to hit the gym as soon as I get clearance from the neurosurgeon.  
- Looking forward to seeing me again as soon as I need the other one replaced...I'm not...but it is inevitable...
From me...
Most of you know that I've had 28 surgeries (mostly minor) in the past 17 years including a hip replacement and back fusion.  The knee was the absolute worst in terms of pain and recovery time.  If you've gotten past the year mark, you can look back and remember the times you thought you'd never survive it, begged for the pain to stop, wanted to kill your PT sadist, wonder if you would ever be whole again.  Guess what?
You CAN'T be whole again!  Your original knee is gone, goodbye.  But what you have in your body is a miracle of science that will allow you to live a decent life again, one with new horizons, new challenges, new skills to master...one without pain.  It takes a long time to get here...like a whole year.  Expect it...if you do it quicker then count your blessings.  Most of us really struggle with this but find strength we didn't know we had. 
For me, I still have all that rehab work to do in the gym once I get past the spine issues.  Get to the gym and kick some serious a$$... I'm getting anxious to start again...another month should do it.  Targeting September for a full recovery.  Who knows...maybe a gentle glide on some new blades...
Keep the faith, brothers and sisters.  We live to fight another day!!!

Why do they not send you home with Gabapentin as well because this is the only drug I was on in hospital that I'm not on now and the pain is much worse.  I had a different physio who although tough was nice but the exercises they expect you to do are horrendous she managed to get me to an 89 degree bend but getting there was worse than childbirth I couldn't believe the pain and was in tears.  Since I've got home I've been walking as much as I can which isn't a problem but the bending and lifting exercises are agony and there is no way I'm getting the bend and lift that she got in hospital in fact i can hardly lift my leg without support.  I'm worried that I'm going to seize up because I can't do the exercises properly. I've been icing it and that's helped and take painkillers before I start but have any of you got any ideas to make the exercises less painful.  I know I'm probably expecting a lot from myself but it's my mums funeral in 3 weeks and I want to be more mobile for that.

"Is your knee pain mostly on the inside of the knee?  Is there numbness and tingling across the entire knee, and if you touch the outside of the knee you can feel it on the inside?  Does the pain change - sometimes it's terrible and other times tolerable?  Has nothing you've tried worked, or did you find something that helped?  I'm asking because I was recently diagnosed with a damaged Infrapatellar branch of the sapheous nerve, following an arthroscopy last year.  Nothing has worked, and I'm due to get a cryoablation of that specific nerve soon, I hope.  I'm curious to know about other peoples' pain after surgery, because it took 14 months for two surgeons to come up with this diagnosis and a lot of pain, and apparently this is not common - or at least is hard to diagnose, which makes me think there's a lot more of it out there.  My nerve was damaged by the initial incision, and I'm sure this must happen with all kinds of knee surgery, so would be interested to here other experiences.

However I have also found out my son, who lives mins drive from from the same hospital, has had his appt to see Gastroenterology, to get the biopsy results from his colonoscopy, put back from May until August!
Worse still a friend who has TERMINAL Cancer has had his appt for this week, cancelled, up to now he hadn't received another appt!
Things are grim when even the dying cannot get to see their specialist!!
I don't hold out much hope of getting my other knee done next year now!! Maybe it's a blip & things will, not improve, but at least remain as they were?
Sorry to be a downer, but it does seem that something is happening to our Hospital! It is a hospital that serves a huge part of Hertfordshire, so there are many more in the same boat I don't doubt!
I hope you are all in better positions.

I'm 10 wks post TKR, walking unaided, driving, back to work last wk. Bend is 115-120 and flat was 0. Physio therapy signed me off 4 wks ago?!! Can self refer if need to. Saw on here how everyone is using an exercise bike so borrowed my brothers at the wknd, easiest setting and I had to higher the seat to get a semi comfortable rotation. Saturday was okay, Sunday okay doing approx 20 rotations 3 times a day, (really struggling with this exercise in fairness) yesterday I got to my 5th rotation and wham, only way I can explain it, is like I've trapped a muscle/nerve, can't now put my heel to the floor without a huge jolt of pain, used my crutches yesterday afternoon to get around not used them since wk 5. Off the crutches today but the walking is poor, and the pain is like being zapped by a tens machine on full blast, going slightly up my thigh and down to my heel. Really appreciate any help or suggestions. I've iced, took my meds etc. I'm in the uk and getting an appointment with either gp/Physio will be like pulling teeth.
Many thank
Michelle

"Hi, first post here.
Basically i've been experiencing knee pains i haven't gotten before, and they're in the patella or meniscus, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments, or at least that's what i conclude from reading a little. 
I'm 5""7, 127 lbs, have been training for a few years, until getting clicking sounds in my left knee while doing pistol squats late last year restricted this to purely upper body work, although i still trek about every other weekend.
I feel as if something in my left knee shifts when bending my knee sometimes, and while doing static squat and calf raise holds just now i got a more pronounced pain in the lateral and collateral ligament sides.
I've never gotten injured before, i don't play basketball or anything involving repeated jumping. I have been wearing orthotics since mid last year although i still find them uncomfortable and findthat they cause my knees to wobble out of neutral when climbing the stairs, so i've done away with them for the moment. I'm wondering if the orthotics could've caused all this.
I'd be very grateful for any advice. Don't want this to jeopardize my lifestyle. I'm too young for that!

"Hi all, I'm glad I read a lot on this forum to see how others are coping with the TKR.  I had my second one 12 years after the first, last March 20, so that's a month and a few days.  I see that lots of people are still suffering much longer than that in recovery!  I had hoped I'd be feeling better by now.  I was hoping to drive on Tues. to a therapy group meeting which I need for my mental health, but so far I sleep so easily while being up in my chair watching tv.  Suddenly I'm awake again 15 min later, and then drop off again.  I don't remember this from the first one.  How soon did any of you begin driving (with the replacement on the undriving leg)?

"I was beginning to seriously think my husband had made a mistake when he'd told me I'd got to 133 on the bend quite a few days ago because it seemed to drop to 128 and then gradually up to 130 again but for a couple of days or so I couldn't push it more than that.  Then last night found I could!  It's the same method - sit as far back in one corner of the recliner chair, with raised bottom, bring foot up so bend is as tight as possible and foot is against base of arm of chair and then lower bottom into chair - it just gives a bit extra push to it.  It's a bit uncomfortable, but I sit like that for five or 10 minutes, then stretch leg out for about 10 or 20 minutes and then repeat.  I do this every evening between 9 and 11 pm.  I broke through the plateau!  I got to 135 (and he did check it twice LOL!) last night.  At 7 and a half weeks, I'm very happy with this and think I might be on course for reaching 140 in a few weeks, but in the meantime, if it doesn't bend more, and I only keep this, then I'm good!  What my physio didn't really tell me, is if I need to keep doing this or will it go backwards again?  And just how long do you need to keep doing it?  Weeks?  Months?

"Well had my 2nd TKR on April 11. I believe it when they say no two are the same. With this one I became hyper sensitive to touch. I couldn't lift my leg at all No one could touch my leg and my thigh swelled up to two times it's normal size. I'm black and blue from top of thigh to bottom of calf. I am just now able to lift leg with no help. Walking has been easier then last time and as long as I'm in the house I can walk unassisted. My biggest problem is the swelling. I have been icing twenty four seven. And I'm still swollen from my thigh to my ankle. What should I do? Pain wise it is a lot less then the other one. I am also taking ibuprofen for the swelling. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

"Two weeks ago at 8am (first on the theare list ) in a state of apprehension ,fear ,depression compounded by no sleep the previous night, I went into theatre at the royal national orthopaedic hospital and had my knee replaced.
I remember the stinging burning sensation as my consultant asked me how I was doing when I was being wheeled from the recovery room to the ward.
He said they were going to get me something for that,which they administered shortly afterwards. .I grabbed my daughter' s hand , tears streaming down my face apparently ..which was 'I made it out the other side ' relief and that she had made it to the hospital ! A huge change from the previous sadness I've suffered.
I.was discharged 3 rd day post op..zoned out from pain on morphine drugs all given me during my stay with intense side effects of nausea, dry mouth ,lips, constipation was LONG and worst I've experienced in my life !
However , everything I've gone through post op , i have been prepared for by the respondents on this site .
It has been a revelation!
It has been a scaremongering at times ( pre op) .
But ..it has been a wonderful place for advice ,for encouragement ,for prep to the op.
So for that,I wish to THANK YOU ALL..Chico marx, Marilyn ,Helen ..a few names I remember off the cuff..writing emails on a phone not same as a laptop ! No Internet access at my elderly mum's in Neasden !
Today the nurse from the orthopaedic hospital came to remove my staples and again..nothing as bad as I envisioned.
Onwards and upwards!

"Ive just had a total knee replacement 2 days ago due to psoriatic arthritis which caused my knee to go knock kneed. My consultant said as i am so skinny the pain would be a lot worse as there was no muscle there. I had a hip replacement in october of last year and that was a walk in the park compared to this. The pain is unbeleivable and the problem is i know its only been 2 days but i cannot lift my leg whatsoever because the pain is so bad the Physio basically said im not trying hard enough and im worried that if i cant lift it they wonnt let me go home my surgeon asked me to lift it and i couldnt but he said because i had lifted it the day of the op that everything was ok it was just a matter of time. I would be grateful to hear from anyone who had this problem and their experience. I know its only been 2 days but im really worried.

"Hi. I haven't posted on here for some months now as things were relatively OK. I had a TKR 2 years ago and though it went OK I have only ever had around 90% flexion. I can live with that but I still get swelling of the knee and if I try to bend it more than 90% (e.g. sitting in tight seating on a train or plane) it is really sore afterwards. I walk five or six days per week for about 45 minutes a time. I am overweight and I am also seeing my surgeon in four weeks about the other knee! I also have spondylosis to contend with which doesn't help. The knee has a slight protrusion unlike the smoother surface of the other knee. I just wonder if it is ever going to be better?

"Evening,
To cut a long story short I had a torn meniscus whilst playing football in 2015. I ended up having surgery to repair the knee.
Months went by and I was in the gym building it back up to full strength how ever it always seemed as though sometching else was up with it? My knee clicks constantly and when I move it around I can feel all sorts of cracks going off inside which feel uncomfortable and sometimes painful.
ive been back to the hospital where I had an MRI scan. The scans came back all fine and the consultant said there was no further damage or action wasn't needed to be taken. He said I'd not left it to heal long enough.
i wanted a second opinion and so was referred to a different hospital. Again I had another MRI and yet again it came back fine, however he did note there were some markings on part of my knee itself but wasn't said it was bruising. He gave me a couple of shots of steroids and said to leave it for now.
A few weeks passed and I had the chance to play football with my mates. I managed to get through 60 minutes of low intensity football however the next day my knee was in agony. It actually took about 8 weeks to stop hurting from that.
Before playing football I was able to go out and run several miles no problem however now I keep getting a pain on the outside of my knee. The past 3 attempts at running I've gone no further than 200 yards as I could feel it hurting again.
Im at a loss as to what I should do now. Originally I was supposed to have the routine operation and within 3 months I'd be back doing what I used to. I fact I've had to retire from sport near enough. It's really getting my down and have had little help from anyone with this.
Anyone else had the same symptoms as me or can anyone give me some advice.
thanks

"This forum has been very informative and helpful in my recovery over these months. To give back, I offer the following thoughts to encourage others to succeed. First, thanks to a gifted surgeon and intense PT, I have returned to pain free mobility and living. A few thoughts on recovery: after your PT concludes, that's when the real recovery and hard work begins. You must exercise every day. I suggest following the exercise recovery plan Chico Marx, TKR godfather, has referenced on this forum. Make every effort to maintain a health body weight. Your knee will reward you for that. Know you will have both bad, worse, but eventually better and better days. Maintain a positive attitude and give thanks everyday for your blessings. Best wishes and regards, RJ.

"The name of the injury im pretty sure it is sinding larsen johansson syndrome as it is right below the petella and there is more of a lump on that knee right under the patella compared to the right knee as it is more smooth. Lets get to what happened last year and ill discuss symptoms and pain at the end. 2 years ago i was diagnosed with scalleters sydrome but it wasnt scalleters because thats below the petalla tendon but its kinda the same thing because of the growth plates being out of position which requires rest for it to come back in place but they are in different places as mine is right below the knee cap.
The problem is, is the injury has came back and it doesnt heal and it doesnt matter how much rest i do it justs wont heal. It feels like i have jumpers knee which i had on right knee but i recovered that overtime which it just went away. The pain is right below the patella. It gets inflammed very easly and it calms down over 4 days of nothing it gets very tender if i dont rest. also this injury has been with me for 7 months or even more. As the injury mainly gets painful over Jumping, running on hard surface, kicking football.
The pain seems to not get better which is the problem. I do have tight legs but i do so much stretching and rolling and i seem not to progress. My quadriceps are very strong as said by a physiopherapist and they are to big to consider weak quads as 80kg squat cant hold weak quads. As this injury has really really effected my mental mind and physical activity on my legs as i have missed out on so much running and leg training. Mentaly affecting me to resist steroids or growth hormones so much. reckon i could get surgury to fix this problem? Im only 17

"Hi all. I had a TKR op 3 weeks ago. Before the op, I suffered from sciatica attacks down the left side brought on by spondylosis in the lower lumbar area. The attacks just happened to be the same side as the leg to be operated on!. Since the op, I've had some pain with sciatica mainly affecting the left hip/top of buttock area. Consultants couldn't answer my questions pre-op about how the sciatica could be dealt with during my recovery. Once the knee has mended I guess I'll have to resort to amitriptyline which is what I was on before the knee op to try and ease the sciatica pain, though it didn't work! Anybody else having this problem. Coping with the post-op knee pain is bad enough but the thought of having to cope with sciatica attacks too is rather daunting. Help!

anyone else having difficulty straightening their Leg?

After my knee replacement 8 wks ago, it has definitely improved (physio says about 6 degrees now) but Getting the crazy thing to straighten all the way seems to be much harder than getting it to bend again.
OFG, if your reading this, I have been doing your suggestion. Lying on the bed stomach down with legs over the bed is a great exercise. Hardest part is getting up!

Should I be concerned at the lack of improvement or is this quite common.
I shall be calling my consultant tomorrow to discuss my concerns.
Thanks

"I'm a 24 year old female. Playing serious sport for over 14 years.
On the 1/4/17 I was playing field hockey as a goalkeeper and in a quick transfer of weight my left knee twisted and gave out. It was extremely painful and there was a pop and multiple crack noises heard.
After an x-ray, CT and MRI it was found that I had dislocated my knee and in the process torn my MPFL and sprained my Medical collateral Ligament. There was also an alvusion fracture (4x2mm loose body) of the medial patella.
I have previously had a history of maltracking in my knees.
In April 2011 I injured my left knee (at the time believed to be jarred) and then again in late 2013 (believed to be a tear of the ACL, found in arthroscope to be severe maltracking).
The sports physician believes that this is the 3rd episode of dislocation and has recommend me on to a surgeon.
I guess I'm looking for advice and any thoughts as to whether surgery is likely or whether it should just be physio recovery.

"I was just wondering if anyone further along than me can say when they thought all the swelling had gone down. Maybe this question is a bit like 'how long is a piece of string' but it's just a question I have rattling around in my head.
My ROM and pain are okish now except I do get the RLS sometimes at bed time which is very annoying but compared to the pain in the first few weeks it's bearable.

"Hi all, I am looking for answers.  I am experiencing the same issues or even worse. I had Partial Knee replacement in Dec, well over 3 mths and still not able to walk independently. I am still using croutches and walker. Saw my Doc several times. No infections. CT normal. Some neuropathy. I was advised to stop going to PT but will restart now. I am looking for answers. I was referred to a neurologist. I am thinking of a 2nd opionion. My knee feels funny like there is something loose but CT shows no lossening or fracture..takes a lot of discomfort to get to at least 2 inches off the bed. He is not able to give me any answer for that. Instructed me to return to PT. Wondering if scar tissue would cause this.  I am concern about swelling of legs and ankles when I try to weight bear. I am not able to lift my knee/legs  I am looking forward to some response/answers. Thanks.

"Discharged 3 days after surgery at end of January and had 3 sessions of 20 minutes phyio since.  Despite doing physio, raising leg and icing bend is only 70 degrees at best.  At last session physio said no more sessions until see surgeon in 4 weeks as not sure what bend surgeon expects given my knee history (have had 3 other surgeries on this leg since age 17) and may have to have bend under anaesthetic and unfortunately this surgery is one where recovery and work is up to me.  Any tips please?  Am trying to stay positive but frustrated.  Also GP not happy about me going back to work but I cannot afford to be off any longer.
Have had a lot of advice for the tendon and muscle pains in first 3 weeks, so hoping for some more advice re bending and walking.  thanks

"I try so hard to stay positive. If I am not, for the most part I have to either fake it, downplay pain. My family is awesome. But I know they are getting as tired as I am.
I am slowly getting better. 16 Weeks. Femoral damage after surgery. Since Wednesday last week I have increased pain again and a lot on the side of the knee and leg. I can manage it with my pain medication but it never takes the pain and discomfort away completely.
I have been in constant relentless pain for 16 weeks. It is just the amount of pain and discomfort that changes.
So tired of it. I am starting to feel anger. Sometimes I wish I could just have it amputated. I just want it to stop.

"I feel I just can't put weight on my right knee after arthroscopy almost three weeks ago -  and the pain is about 2 cm below knee on the inside extending around knee and downwards to lower limb.  I think it's the area of MCL.  Should I get another xray /mri scan?   There is slight swelling but the 'look '  of it isn't as bad as the pain I'm experiencing and I just can't get about.   It's particularly bad when twisting.   But even going straight forwards involves some twisting I find!    It feels like a sprained knee.

"11 days post RTKR and experiencing a lot of severe pain. Neuropathic pains at night are about a 10. The kneecap is super tender to touch and has sharp pains on moving. I'm taking the meds as prescribed but they barely keep the pain bearable and certainly not those at 3 am which are searing down the whole leg.
?Had physio today which seems to have made it all worse.
?Everyone I speak to seems to make more progress with less pain than me, although I know we cannot compare against others of course, I do wonder if my pain is to be expected or something to worry over? Today sat next to a guy who only took one dose of painkillers after surgery and has great results with his knee. I have been similar with other types of surgery so never expected to be so floored by TKR.
?Old knee very painful and limiting but at least I could manage the pain. I am going back to the GP to review the meds. The ones I have not strong enough really and making me drowsy with low BP and feeling faint, not something to be when on crutches.
?I know it can get better with time but do high levels of post op pain and neuro pain indicate something not going right (no signs of infection etc) or can these too resolve?
?It is hard to perform the excercises in this state causing concern about range of movement etc.

"Hello to all, I'm about to my wits end with this knee cap replacement! I had my surgery in April of this year. I can't do nothing without being in pain. The more I move around the more I hurt and the more my knee swells and doesn't want to cooperate. The more I sit still the stiffer my knee gets. It is still waking me up all hours of the night and I just can't deal with it no more. I'm tired of being told there's nothing more that can be done. Im tired of being in pain. It snaps, pops, grinds, feels like it's getting caught on something, gives out on me. What is wrong with this picture? Surely this isn't the way it's gonna be? I'm just fed up! Now the Dr wants to send me to get injections. I'm tired of those too. I get them in my back and my sacral joints. Has anyone had so many issues with these implants before?

Currently my knee schedule(?) is Exercise/Practice with a Heat Pack strapped to my knee so it keeps them warm - Get home and remove heat pack and replace it with ice - cold bath, it usually still hurts after.

"I was thinking about this yesterday.  They send you home a day or two after the op, on crutches, telling you to move the crutches first, and then the operated foot up to the crutch level and then the other one.  Fine.  But I had to ask roughly when to go on to two sticks (was told three weeks approximately) but actually found I could go on at about two weeks, and then on to one very shortly after.  BUT there was no instructions on gait when walking on crutches etc. OR at what point to start a normal stride rather than operated leg up to crutches and then the other one up to that.  What did others do?  A few days after I came home I started lengthening stride so I was gradually walking more normally by the time I went on to two sticks, and also making sure I wasn't leaning forward, but when you don't get to see a physio, this is rather left to the patient to think about!  Nothing was mentioned in exercise sheets or anything about going from walking up to crutch/stick level and then increasing it to normal gait.

"My husband is arguing that I shouldn't be pushing the bend on knee to the point of pain (waiting for the gel to come tomorrow which might help!) because he's saying I'm likely to be doing damage.  But I'm worried that this window to increase the bend isn't that big a window and if I don't push it now I'm not going to get the best from it.  I know it's easier as far as the bend I've achieved - around, or just over the 115, because I've been able to put the recumbent bike two notches forward to where it was before I had the op, and have done two circuits today with no problem, whereas it was hard to even get four revolutions on it five days ago, but I still feel I'm not pushing myself enough while he's saying I'm pushing too fast!  I'm not on pain meds at all, so wondering if I should be, even a couple of times a week to try and push this bend more but if I should be, should I be asking the GP for them?  And what's the best that won't make me drowsy during the day but be effective to reduce pain for a very short period while I try and push this bend?  Or am I going over the top with trying to increase it too quickly.  Is my husband right then?

"So exactly a week ago I had a bucket handle tear in my left knee, medial meniscus removed. I feel im doing pretty good getting my range of motion back, but im still experiencing pretty good pain in my knee. Swelling is almost all gone as well.
I also have a decent limp, because if I walk on it normal, or try to, it feels like my leg is about to snap in half at the knee and causes pretty good pain. Just sitting here ill get shooting pains in the same area where it was before the tear. For example sitting on the toilet is very painful in the normal position.
Is this normal? Surgeon made it sound like id be perfectly fine a few days after surgery. I go for my post op on Tuesday and was expecting to go get cleared to go back to work that day as well (work construction, lots of heavy lifting ect) but now im questioning it. Oh, and sleep is pretty miserable as well.
I normally tolerate pain extremely well, but this is just getting annoying now. Maybe its because I was under the impression of the surgeon id be fine in a few days and in 2 weeks it would be like nothing ever happened? Is this normal at this stage 1 week out?

At 15 weeks post op with very difficult recovery and complications I am at the level of about someone who is doing well at roughly 4-6 weeks. I still have to use the walker; sitting very low tolerance; standing very low tolerance. Still on narcotics but at least it is every 6 hours now. ROM is all over the place and highest was at 116. I at least do not fall lower than 100 anymore. Walking 0.5 miles per day spread out over 12 hours. Ice every 2 hours. Home excercises and physical therapy x2 a week.
Had to have dental work done. Told to stop Ibuprofen with interaction with antibiotics. 3 Days without it I woke up with a pain level I thought I had long left behind. My ankle also terribly sore. Knee felt nice and ""loose"" after last pt. Now it's ""locked"" again and I can tell by heel slides that ROM is way down. Dread seeing the pt guy tomorrow.
Rest, icing elevating, excercises but not overdoing it. Pain meds. Gentle massage and restarted the Ibuprofen. Can't think of any more to do. Also begs the question of just how long am I going to be on Ibuprofen which worries me.
I know about setbacks but I thought my knee was past this pain level for sure.

"Hi all,

Along with gaining knowledge for my personal journey, I am conducting research regarding the return to sport after an ACL reconstruction.
I would like to know:
1. After the ACL injury, do you believe you had a negative or positive psychological response to the injury and throughout your rehab?
2. Did you return to sport and did you find it a difficult process?
3. If you were offered with a booklet containing a rehab program, certain goals to be met at the end of each phase and coping strategies to deal with psychological factors brought about by this injury, would you use it to benefit your rehab and return to sport? (yes/no)
If you wish to consent me to utilise your information for research purposes, please let me know in your response.

"My knee started to swell in October 2013 (two months after a non-weight bearing injury to the knee whilst bent).
I received 6 months of physio before being referred to an Orthopedic consultant who referred me for an Xray and MRI. These both came back suggesting no structural damage.
I was referred on to Rheumatology in the September of 2014 where they did blood tests and aspirated the knee. My bloods came back clear as did the synovial fluid from my knee.
I have since been in the Rheumatology department and had it drained 3 times with one other MRI since then. Every time the swelling has come back.
I recently had an ultrasound and that also showed no structural damage just a lot of fluid!
I am at a loss of what could be the problem, or how to fix it. I have tried long term antiinflammatories, rest, ice, tape, exercise and none of those seemed to make any difference to the swelling.
Does anyone have any suggestions? It has been nearly 3 years now!

"Hi All,
With both of my tkr's the doc used staples to close the outer wound and apparently dissolving stitches in the layers below the surface. First, the staples caused a reaction to my skin ( they contain nickle and I'm allergic to it). Doc didn't think it would be too much of a problem since they would only be in for 2 weeks. That was 2 weeks too long. It was a mess, local infections along the frankenstein wound. Put antibiotic cream on it to help it heal. Then, undissolved stitches appeared at the open wounds and i fished them out with tweezers.
Doc said it was normal since dissolving st under the skin can take months to dissolve and my body is revolting against them. Anyone experience this with tkr's?
Thanks. Elaine in Michigan

I'm unable to take any NSAIDS due to history of stomach ulcers now wondering if that is prolonging my recovery. I just want to feel better and get my life back. Very depressed at times. When does all of this get better??

Surely mine funded by the NHS wasn't made from scratch.

"Well what can I say that hasn't already! Came out the surgery feeling it hadn't been as bad as the picture I had built up in my own mind! Day following surgery was able to do all my excercises and was also signed of by o/t as I had no problem dressing, sitting on the toilet, getting in the shower etc, Great I thought! Then day two, I couldn't even lift my leg! Exercise seemed impossible and my knee was three times the size of the other, physio assured me that was fairly normal and to keep on trying to get through the exercises, taking all the pain relief they had to offer and using loads of ice I finally managed day three exercises, but physio said I can't be discharged until I can get at least 80/85 bend, I'm only getting 65/70 with a push. So they decided to put me on a bend machine, designed for day 5 patients post op, I was very apprehensive about this, anyway the young lad assured it be be fine and once it gets going my leg bend will improve daily, he said I could use the machine as often as I felt able, indicating twice a day for an hour or two, the machine does work very slowly.
So he strapped me into the contraption and off he went leaving me to manage alone, he never returned. After almost the hour I managed to get a nurse to get me out, I had had enough! My leg was agony and I could barely walk. Day four and I'm still in hospital but feel I have taken a step backwards following the kinetic machine, and I don't know when I'll get the bend close to 70 again, right now I'm lucky to get 40/45, has this happened to anyone else so soon after surgery?
Thanks for taking the one to read this.

"I'm 19 and in October 2016 my right knee randomly started hurting above and below the kneecap and behind my knee. I went to my GP when the pain didn't go away about a week later and was sent for X-rays and blood tests to check for arthritis. This came back clear and I was then sent for physiotherapy for ten weeks. This didn't help and in fact made the pain worse.
Following this I went for an MRI which came back clear, in told. My GP last week sent me for a specialist referral to see an orthopaedic surgeon however I received a letter saying my referral was declined because the condition isn't serious enough. After going back to see my GP today they have said there is nothing more they can do.
I now don't know how I can get a diagnosis for my pain it hasn't got any better in five months and I fear no one will be able to help me solve it.
Please help with any guidance you may have to try and get a diagnosis or treatment.
Many thanks in advance.

"Hi everyone my GP had referred me to the hospital with a view to a knee replacement. I had surgery on a torn meniscus 2 years ago, the consultant who performed the surgery did feel I would be back within 2 years. I've been suffering with arthritis and over the past 6 months it's deteriorated rather quickly. X rays taken in November showed it to be moderate and as cortisone shots and Physio sessions didn't do anything I was referred. Saw another consultant in November last year, he felt a replacement wouldn't be beneficial and suggested another cortisone and more Physio. The cortisone lasted 2 weeks and Physio had no results. Back to GP yet another referral been told I won't get an appointment for at least 8-10 weeks with a further 6-12 week wait. I'm in so much pain can barely walk. Am trying to push through continuing walking and on a weight loss plan to try and help. Feel so lost at the moment. Sorry for moaning guys.

"I'm nearly 14 months post op TKR on right knee. Nightmare of a year. Trying hard to get back to some semblance of normality. The whole experience knocked the stuffing out of me as they say.
My balance borders on appearing drunk one day to a little bit of normal gait another day. Also the pain has returned of a nighttime so I'm getting no proper sleep.
I must naive but I really thought I would start recovering after six weeks and not keep going back and forwards all the time.
I'm beginning to wonder if I've been given a really cheap bog standard prosthetic knee which will never replace my own
Copper cobalt!
Would like to see one of these knees and hold it to feel the weight.
Some days it feels like I've got a piece of lead in my leg.
When I saw the surgeon for the last time he he said I had muscle wastage and said hydrotherapy would help.
Anyway today I had my first hydrotherapy session for half an hour - does it to any good?
A word of advice - don't think you're getting the best when you go NHS in a private hospital - you're not!!

"....still very painful on walking eight months down the line. The consultant said the new knee looks fantastic but it is still very painful.He said just to keep on walking. I wish I could but it is so painful. To make matters worse my left knee is now playing up more. The past few days I have found walking very difficult and painful. The doctor just seems to agree with the consultant, keep walking on it. Is this it then? Will I always be walking with a painful new knee or will it improve with time? 
I thought all the pain would be in the past now. It's worse than it was before.

I started Physio at the Hospital this week and when I got measured at my first session on Tuesday I was at 75 degrees bend, and -10 degrees extention. Worked like a trouper in my session, and then carried on with my usual exercises at home the following day. Session 2 was yesterday, and I was re-measured - still 75 degrees bend, but 0 degrees extention!! Cant believe Ive got it straight so quickly, Im really pleased (but I'm guessing that when I was measured on Tuesday I maybe hadnt ""warmed up"" enough and that I was maybe a little better than -10...) and Im feeling pretty hopeful that this time around its all going to go according to plan!

"I think this is a stretch and i just got hit with a particularly nasty bug but I'm curious if anyone has experienced a weaker immune system as far out as post op TKR 13 weeks.
I typically have a strong immune system and rarely get sick. I even had the flu shot pre surgery as added precaution. And I've been healthy up until 3 weeks ago. I am on 2nd round of a now different antibiotic. I have had sinusitis, bronchitis and strep throat these past 3 weeks.
I travelled out of state beginning of March and think i caught something from being on the airplane. But it's really strange as i never take this long to recover.
I was just curious if perhaps my immune system was or still is weakened from accepting the TKR and the surgery. And i wondered if anyone else experienced anything similar.
Thanks.

"I'm so sorry to be asking more and hope I'm not coming over as self obsessed!  Since the physio told me about a week ago to stop pushing the knee to the point of the excruciating pain at the back of the knee when I was getting 115 degree bend, I've got less and less bend!  We're now on about 100 - 110, depending on something (don't know what!).  I've not been on any painkillers for weeks, the normal ointments at the back of the knee aren't helping.  I am icing and elevating, but something Clive said about the hot bath is making me wonder if I should be applying HEAT anywhere - back or front of knee????  OR should I be asking my GP for a REALLY strong painkiller just to try and get that bend back once a day or something?  OR is it all par for the course and as it all heals this back of the knee thing will sort itself out and the bend will come back?  I'm fumbling my way through this!  Oh boy, at the end of this I'm going to be a knee expert LOL!  Until the other one is done and it's all different LOL!

After a visit to my surgeon, he discovered a hidden stitch which he removed & the leaking completely stopped.  After a few more days I was able to return to PT.

"Hello all,
I had my MRI yesterday and received the report.  One of the findings state I have a subcentimeter parameniscal cyst along the posteromedial margin of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. However, no meniscal tears are identified.
My follow up with the Dr is in one week, and was hoping someone could advise if this is something the Dr would normally fix without evidence on the report of a meniscus tear.  My limited research found one or two articles of similar cases, and also mentioned that a meniscus tear (horizontal) doesn't always show on the MRI itself.  
Backround 
-Broken femur 15 years ago. Removal of  femur nail, screws in knee and hip 3 years ago.  
-hip impingement surgery 2 years ago.
-former runner, collegiate tennis, and skier.
Symptoms
Inner knee pain, popping, and more inflamation type pain with more acrtivity.  Knee doesn't seem to move through normal motion. Pain on kneecap, lower knee, and inner knee.  Seems difficult to stretch quad muscle, but stretching does help.  Daily activities pretty limited at this point.  Tried no weight lunges  once which seemed to set me back a few days to none weight bearing.  
Any insights would be greatly appreciated

I called the nurse at the Orthopedic Center and I just knew she would tell me to come I immediately. She said to ask my pt tomorrow but it didn't sound abnormal to her. Probably overdid it yesterday. I did lots of heel slides yesterday.

"4 weeks today since TKR surgery. The knee can be very 'tight' at times (almost all the time) even after flexing & straightening exercises. Flexibility is improving week by week, little by little. Pain relief is now 500mg Naproxin after breakfast & evening meal and 500mg Paracetamol, sometimes 2, sometimes just 1 - depending what's planned and what I need to get up to.
For at least couple weeks almost every time I wake-up my leg goes very tight (from calf to groin) just like a cramp and can be very painful, specially the knee, typically lasting few seconds up to couple of minutes. At first I assumed it's the pain waking me up although feels like pain hits immediately after waking. No difference how I lay, which is mostly on my back. Leg doesn't feel cool in any way so I guess blood circulation is OK. If there is a known remedy to avert waking up with this pain I will appreciate knowing, please? Thank you.

"Hi i have found this website to be really helpful so far and the people on here are full of great advice and make you feel your not the only one with knee problems.
Anyhow ive just been diagnosed with moderate/severe osteoarthritis of my knee and i have mild in my other. It was a shock in some ways to find out that it was moderate/severe, only found out last Friday so it might take time to sink in. Dont get me wrong i have suffered with painful, swollen,stiff knees for years (i had repeated dislocations of knees when i was younger) but in 2014 my right knee got worse so doctor sent me for xray which showed mild wear and tear, which was how she explained it.I didnt know that that meant osteoarthritis and doctor didnt explain that this was the case. So i just carried on as normal, boy if only i knew.
Anyhow here i am 3 years down the line. My doctor as said that im too young for knee replacement,im 43,but from what ive read im petrified of having this done! Basically i have got try and live with it and take painkillers. Not been given much advice, i struggle on steps and stairs and my walking isnt great but i might get a walking stick to help with this.

"I am a 67 year old female and had a TKR and patella resurfacing on 9th Feb. My dressing was changed at the hospital and then after about 10 days, changed by the practice nurse at my surgery. Her first remarks were on how puckered, raised and lumpy it was looking, which really worried me as it did look rather like the edge of a cornish pasty! A few days later a friend looked at it and said the same and mentioned that somone else she knew didn't have such a dreadful scar at the same stage, which put me into panic mode. i had no external stitches or clips - just internal soluble stitches and glue. I mentioned this to a friend who was a nurse and has had both knees and hips replaced, and she reassured me that once the stitches dissolve and pop, all will be flat and neat. As if by magic, as I lay in bed that following night doing my usual 3 hour wakeful tossing and turning stint, I felt something go pop in my knee and in the morning hey presto, the lumps and bumps and raised areas were completely flat with a neat scar. Magic!!! Why don't they tell you this in hospital and reassure you that this will happen? Don't know if any other ladies have been worrying about this, but be reassured.

Some of the exercises that have been working for me are: stair climber, stationary bike with resistence between 15-20 for thirty minutes, knee bends with or without weights, speed walking, a step box about 18 inches high, and side stepping with resistance bands. Keep in mind, it is important to include upper body exercises such as weight lifting to your routine as well. Also, maintaining a healthy body weight through proper nutrition is a must.

"Hi all
I'm 23 and i work in a busy warehouse walking for 10 hours a day and not to long ago I started getting a pain in the right side of my right knee causing me to limp around in pain at times the pain could be really bad to where I have to stop for a minute or 2 then the pain would subside for a while then it would come back I've done my own research on the smptoms and I think I narrowed it down to a meniscus tear or osteoarthritis there's no swelling no bruising pain comes and goes doesn't lock or feel like it's catching. just yesterday I was walking about at work and all this pain in the outside of my right knee as gone but now I have the exactly the same pain in the same place on my left knee within the space of ten minutes I was pain free in one knee but in alot of pain in the other as anyone had same issues or heard of this before

"Was so happy today, therapist said I turned a corner and doing so well. I am 7 weeks post op and measured today at 110 on my own and 115 with help. In two days since last measurement went up 5 degrees. Tonight however in such throbbing pain! Finally couldn't take it any more and took a Vicodin which I only like to take before PT. It is so unbelievable how you can feel so good one minute and feel so lousy the next. So far the Vicodin is not even helping! Hope it kicks in soon! The ups and downs of this surgery can be so depressing. I'm sure there are a lot of you up right now in the middle of the night experiencing the same thing. Need some company, if up start typing!

" I had TKR 22 months ago stopped taking any kind  medication after 18 months put myself on a diet was 10st 2lb, now 9st although i was only on iburufin but i think mediction keeps weight on you. The reason i stopped medicating was i hurt when tacking the tablets &  it made my head hurt also just felt the pain never ending and the rest  of my body went into slow down.Pain never completley stops, but certainly dont feel so helpless and bad all the time. The problem i have now developed, and is waking me in the night is my iliotibial band,a large muscel running on outside of the leg from hip to the knee.I have the exercises to do to help it which hurt so much when doing. However my ? is,  Should i not do them every day if it hurts and or perhaps do them every other day so not to over do the good, and has anyone else had the same happen.   Thanking you all Beryl

"12 weeks this week. Nerve and muscle damage. Still on narcotics every 4-6 hours. Barely walking. The muscle still too weak to make knee weight bearing.
Surgeon put back to work date as May 6th. Felt intimidated by work and had surgeon revise note to return March 30.
Just spent another almost week on bed rest. I know there is no way I will be able to go back then. Unless there is a miracle in the next two weeks.
Have consulted with legal firm and I am protected by the ADA. Can't be fired even if I take a decent amount of extra time off.
I am thinking to let work know now with fair warning that I will be out after all until the original return date. I feel a lot of pressure from some family and colleagues to return to work. I feel intimidated.
BTW, I am normally a tough cookie. I suffer from chronic migraines and never miss work. If it was just pain I could ""tough"" it out, but I cannot sit, walk. Still on walker with severe pain when walking. Can only manage very limited walking.

The first few days were understandably really hard, with pain like Id NEVER felt before, but then it seemed to settle quite a bit - to the point of me saying that I thought it was easier than the first 2. BIG mistake!! the past couple of days have been a nightmare, and quite literally all I've been able to do is excercise, rest, ice and elevate. 
Maybe there was an element of adrenaline in the first 10 days or so - Id been building up so much to this surgery, and everyone in the Hospital commented on how positive, upbeat and cheery I was...and I felt that way too. Laughing and joking with the nursing staff, helping my fellow TKR'ers in hospital as much as I could.....now all of a sudden it feels like Ive somehow deflated....hard to put into words....maybe that everyone else's lives are continuing as normal while I'm recovering and recouperating - again!!

"It's eight weeks today since my tkr and Im feeling so positive. Just returned from pt-120/0 so have been cleared to continue my programme at home-daily stretches, bike, daily oil massages and pool sessions three times weekly. Yes, its certainly been an experience but after three years of pain and limping, I am determined to get my life back. My main reason for this post is to share with others who are perhaps questioning whether a tkr is=
1- manageable
and 2-suitablefor those with a hefty weight problem.
The answer is yes, but you need to do the hard yards.
Im a sixty three year old female who weighed 115 kg when I started this journey, not very fit and with a knee that was causing all sorts of distress-something had to give (besides the knee).
I saw the surgeon last November and was advised a tkr was my only option(bone on bone, spurs, fluid) the general picture that goes with a tkr. My main concern was my weight and how I would manage the recovery process. After agreeing to have tbe surgery (10th Jan) I then set about to do as much as possible to aid the recovery process. Firstly, I read many of the posts on here and as much as possible, tried to educate myself on the whys and wherefores of a tkr. I very soon came to the conclusion I had to do something and fast. I brought an exercise bike-two x daily ten minute sessions to help build the quads in conjunction with a step programme aided by the use of weights. Six weeks was all I had. The day of surgery I was very apprehensive as we all are. Four hours after waking in recovery I was out of bed for the first time and so surprised ( so were the staff) that I could actually lift my leg back onto the bed unaided. Home on day four and yes, a few uncomfortable days and many sleepless nights but my pain has been manageable with ice and heat packs. I found I no longer required strong painkillers after day thirteen (Im obviously one of the very lucky ones) and have been able to manage pain with paracetamol. I still limp but only use a cane when going out. Every day is an improvement -my weight is now down to 105 kg-still got a way to go but with my knee on the improve things are looking bright. Yes, I still have a down day now and then, but hey, as chico says, we are in this for the long haul.
There are many here who have expereinced the worst of a tkr. For some, the road has been tough. There are no miracles or quick fixes -it's a long haul but I hope in sharing my story, for those who are reticent due to weight/fitness issues-perhaps I have somehow managed to inspire you-it can be done Yes, eight weeks is early days but its eight weeks closer to having my life back and Im feeling positive. Onwards and upwards.

"Greetings to those who have had and are yet to experience, the rawness of knee replacement surgery.
I saw my surgeon yesterday for my (nearly) 12 month follow up visit. I was asked how I rated my outcome from bilateral total knee replacements on March 21, 2016. I said ""left knee 100/100..right knee 60/100. He said ""well that's an average of 80% so that's not bad"". ""Well"" I stated, ""I am unhappy with the pain in my right knee and I want a solution"". He gave me one. Cortisone injections with a risk of infection. ""No siree"" I said. Thanks but NO THANKS. So I went to a Physio today. He put the TENS machine on my leg and did some massage and now I am walking pain free.
I will try and do whatever I have to to get an optimum result for myself.
Never, ever give up! Kick or be kicked! Do not stop searching for a pain free outcome. I will not stop expecting the best for myself.
Thank you to all those here who have given me such great input. I am hopeful that in 6 months I will be able to walk without feeling pain and feeling weird. Balance is still an issue for me but the pain is diminishing daily.
Have hope. Do the work, exercise. Have faith.
Hugs and love from the Land of Oz.

"For the past 5 years I have been on medication for high blood pressure. Just over 3 weeks ago I had a TKR and as my blood pressure was low after surgery, they took me off my medication. I have been told to take my BP daily at home to monitor it and it remains a low/normal for someone my age (111/72 this morning). Naturally, i am delighted not to have to take my pills at the moment but was wondering why this has happened and if anyone else has had the same issue. Is it likely to remain low or go up again? I have also lost 8lb in weight...again i'm thrilled about this though don't hold out any hopes for the weight to stay off once I've recovered. I am making a good recovery and walking without my crutches a nd as far as I know I didn't require a transfusion during surgery.

"Hi, I am 7 weeks post revised Total Knee replacement. I am a 45 year old lady and this is my 7th surgery on this knee.  I had a Patello femoral replacement & Tibia Tubicle transfer 7 years ago which failed hence the TKR so young.  I had forgotten how horrible this operation was. I have not slept more that two hours in one night since the op (16th Jan 17) and Im exhausted. Tried meds from the doctor but just keep waking every half hour or so in pain, just cant get comfortable. Progress has been very slow (in my opinion, however I know im very impatient) and to date Im still only getting 90 deg bend despite doing all the exercises religously.  In the last week I have been getting the most painfull stabbing pain in the back of my knee and I saw PT yesterday and he cannot tell me what it might be.  I am seeing my consultant in a couple of days and have lots to ask him. I have got so desperate that I have purchased some Arnica Sports gel to try and massage into the back of the knee to see if it will help bring out any lingering bruising and swelling and try and get some relief.  I was wondering if any of you lovely people on here have used this to aid recovery and if so what results did you get? I must say what a god send finding this forum has been, you have all made me feel that what I am experiencing and feeling is completely normal and Im not useless and a whimp !

"Well it's all going incredibly well, but I'm just a tad worried about one thing.  I'm getting some leakage into the dressing.  The hospital have said it's fine so long as it's contained in the Aquacel dressing, but I notice if I bend the knee more, then I get more fluid coming out.    Is this normal for it to be coming out a week after the op?  Many thanks!

"To everyone who replied to my rather ""sad"" post the other day (!) can I say a huge thank you to all of you for your encouraging, kind and helpful replies.  You are all so correct when you say everyone is different and we all heal at differing rates.  I think I may have forgotten this in my desire to please my PT who, in any case, always looks as though she sucks lemons for a living!  I am religiously doing those exercises twice per day (I even set an alarm for the pm session) and hope that when I see her again on 20th March, things will be much improved.  At that time, I can say, in all honesty, that I have tried my very best.  Again, thank you all.

"is it normal to feel so much pain and discomfort at this stage? I'm beginning to think either something's wrong or I'm a complete whimp. I'm still taking 4 doses of Tramadol and Paracetomol and 3 Ibuprofen but some days it's still quite unbearable. 
I'm still not driving although I have an automatic car as I still struggle to bend my knee enough to get in and out. Does this bend ever come back?!?
some days I feel so down and so frustrated with what seems like a never ending battle.
i honestly wish I hadn't had it done ... is this a normal feeling to have at my stage of post op??

"Hi everyone, just looking for abit of advice? I had an MRI on my left knee, which came back I had fluid on my knee. I'm just looking for the best ways to reduce the fluid and help with the pain? I take pain killers (zapain) but I suffer migraines and they seem to trigger them off, other pain killers aren't helping, also deep freeze can help too. Just looking for as much advice as I can and ""dos"" and ""don'ts"" to help me recover!

"Before my TKA I was tested for metal and bone cement allergies. I was found to be highly allergic to nickel and moderately allergic to bone cement. My surgeon was unable to use a replacement that was both nickel free and bone cement free so he decided to use a bone cement saying he thought I would do fine. I am 8 weeks post- op with a flexion of 123, my PT thinks I am doing great. However, I have a tremendous amount of stiffness , pain and skin sensitivity. I can't walk a reasonable distance without stiffness setting in. I think
there should be greater improvements with stiffness, pain and skin issues at 8 weeks. I have read horror stories in patients with metal and bone cement  allergies and hope that my stagnant improvement is not due a reaction to the bone cement. Does anyone have any experience with bone cement allergies specifically ? And at 8 weeks post op where should the average pain level, stiffness  and skin sensitivity be ?

"Well had my 6 week post Op consultation with my surgeon today, very happy with how its all gone and sent for further Xrays on the hip, came back to see him after and now on the waiting list for a THR on the same left side.
So happy in how it's gone, honestly compared to bone grafts etc i have found it not bad at all, yes there was pain after surgery (GA) but i expected that and more.
So the Consultant expects about a 4 month wait, but i look at that as time which can only help me get prepared for the next Op, and still recover fully from this one.
Good luck to all, and thanks

Quad still very weak and wasted so have to work on that so intend to go to pool most mornings. The ache at back of the knee is due to tight calf muscle and she massaged it (ouch) which seemed to free up the tightness.

"Hello, I'm new. I don't know if this is directly a knee problem, but I wasn't sure where else to post it and I am in need of some help about it.
I can't seem to straighten out my legs, in any kind of stride, without exerting a lot of force to try and keep them somewhat straight. I know this is a bad way to go about it, but I don't know what to do. Standing, my knees look like they stick out a bit, but I'm never experiencing any pain in my knee. Only in my feet and lower back. I've noticed what looked like extra curvature in my back, and judging by my posture, thought that lordosis was possible. But no doctor has ever addressed it, and my mother swears up and down that I don't have a structural problem.
She could be right, but this only ever happens to the extent that it does when I'm not wearing shoes. (as it mainly happens at school, and some other public places) I can walk differently without shoes on; I usually take a toe first and bring down the whole foot.
With shoes, I'm forced to walk differently, and I can't keep my knees from bending so much, no matter what I do. I bought arch supports. Those don't help either. I really need help identifying this. It's taken a toll on me socially as well. I'm still in school, and I am constantly taunted and made fun of about it when I'm not around (or when people don't think I can hear) if anything, it's not on my agenda to care all that much, but it's emotionally taxing having to walk around calculating every step, still being made a jest for it, and knowing nothing I'm doing atm is helping. I'm worried other problems could develop from it as well. I need answers. Please help!

"Hi, just wanted some advice as can't find anything online anywhere else.
At the age of 11 I was informed My left leg is approximately 1 inch shorter than the other. I'm now 30 and find sometimes I get knee pain in the shorter leg, mostly in cold weather. I tend to lean on the left side more than the right and have found sometimes I have left hip pain after very long periods of leaning. My latest issue has been driving. I wondered if anyone else has similar issue. I was stuck in traffic almost crawling for 2 hours and by the time I got out of the car my left leg was in absolute agony. Could this be linked to having a shorter leg, especially as if stretching further with my left leg when driving. If I move my seat forward it becomes difficult to accelerate therefore unsure what the best position would be to drive in. Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks

"Well the op was done on Wendesday morning and it's now Friday afternoon.  I could have come home yesterday if salt levels had been higher but they were on the low side, so they kept  me in for an extra day.  It went BRILIANTLY!  I'd been a tad nervous about having a spinal but there was absolutely no need to worry - the worst part of the whole thing was the sloshing of antibacterial wash on my spine - boy it was cold LOL!  but the numbing injection could barely be felt and the spinal wasn't felt at all.  Nothing.  They gave me a sedative as well and while I was very vaguely aware of some talking  and at some point a bit of hammering and then some stapling, it was all so well removed from me that I wasn't bothered at all.  Coming round I did feel sick and was later as sick as a dog.  But that afternoon they had me up and walking around on a frame which was no trouble at all and yesterday we went to crutches, again no trouble at all.  The pain is so little.  They've told me I've GOT to take the paracetamol and Ibuprofen but the codeine is left to my choice when I want to take it.  There is a good supply though.  Flexibility is way more than they expected - they said I'm a couple weeks on from what they'd expect with exercise and walking  I think the treadmill and bike use was beneficial before.  Quite sleepy still, but that's no problem.  They did put a waterproof dressing on so I showered as soon as I got home.  Now have a bag of peas on knees but am going to order the cryo cuff to come soon.  Doctors are booked to take staples out on Monday week.  The hospital was phenomenal and all the staff were incredibly sweet and caring.  So now looking forward to the other one being booked in, hopefully when I go for my check up.  So now the work starts, keeping up the exercise and taking care of the new knee!  I will keep you all up to date with progress every few days but wanted to say thank so much for all the advice and help before the op!  Oh, while I remember, in case it helps - I'd been told about bladder leakage as the spinal wears off so bought some pads and used them, even though it turned out I didn't need it, but the lady in the bed opposite didn't use one but did have leakage, so it might be a good idea if people do want to cover themselves for that.

"This is my second knee, the better of the two until replacement that is.
I have two questions .
My PT says I'm 5 degrees from straight . Yet when I do the exercise it hurts majority behind my knee. To the point of tears. Is that normal.??
My second question is stiffness when walking and gets worse the more I walk. My PT said I shouldn't be walking for the first 2 months this but with my first knee replacement they said walk, ice , exercise, ice, ice,ice,.
I had stopped icing but when back to it cause it helped the pain. I'm not on as much pain .meds.
Should I be concerned ?
This PT is not like my first one , he's to soft and barely does much with me., last visit he was more concerned about my scar and it being tender to touch then exercising me.
I do what I can at home , I'm just frustrated from the stiffness and behind knee pain.
Any suggestion would be appreciated

"Hi, I am 48 and had my knee replacement just over 2 years ago. Chatting with my sister last night and she mentioned going to Flip Up for exercise classes. Completely forgetting about my new knee I said yes! Then it dawned on me this morning this may not be a good thing.
We will most probably spend most of the class giggling but I am now worried that this maybe not a good thing. Could it loosen the implant and shorten the life of my knee? I had a really bad time when I had my knee done and at times I regretted having it done but now I am so glad I did as my quality of life is so much better. I know I will most probably need to have it done again as being young for my first one. But really don't want to have it done again so soon if can be helped due to wear and tear. Looking after my knee is priority :-)

"After a TKR, you've gotta do the physical therapy...seriously!!!  Your PT will take two measurements in ""degrees"" or angle: how straight the leg is (a negative number; zero is straight) and how far back it can bend towards your butt (positive number; more that 120 is the goal).  When I started, my leg was -14 and + 84.  After 9 weeks of PT twice a week plus work at home, I'm -1 and +128...virtually back to normal.  If you want full range of motion on your knee again, your goals are 0 and +120 or better.  Your therapist should be keeping track of the numbers.
The other goal is to rebuild your quadricep.  Leg presses and lifts in the gym...squats at home.  Make the quad stronger to take the pressure off the knee.  Start slow with light weights and more reps.  Build endurance before you build strength.  I'm very lucky to have a daughter who is an ACSM and ACE certified personal trainer.  She's brutal but effective.  Completely rehab'd a total hip replacement in six weeks (5 hours a day, six days a week in a therapy pool and gym).  Gotta do the work to get the result you want: A year from surgery, it should feel like the operation never happened.
CAUTION: For the knee, don't push it too hard.  Swelling will be the result if you do.  Then you have to back off until it returns to normal.  Slow and easy for the knee.  The hip can be pushed and rehab'd quickly...the knee takes time and patience.  Swelling?  Back off.

When I go to PT it's just a matter of using the different machines with instructions that's it, he doesn't do anything, That causes pain. Does this sound normal?

"First tkr Nov 22, first hip,tkr Nov 4, right knee tkr feb 17we really do forget the initial pain. I was told before hand this would go more roughly as they also had to move knee to ankle six inches in to straighten leg. Needed to go about ten but too drastic of a change. Have walked crooked at least 10 years. Questions though
Pain in under control but I am sleeping a whole lot. Even when I get up and sit up I can just fall asleep. I have cut the opioid as of yester#ay morning and that is helping some. I don't do alot of things myseld, don't cook, need help dressing, certainly not going anywhere, wearing my lounge pants every day. I know I have gotten a bit stronger this week but way behind last time.
Anyone have the's experiences?

"About a year ago I injuried my knee. It was the first pratice outside in the field for softball season. The truff was still very wet, and clung to everyone's shoes. I went to twist to start running when my foot got stuck in the mud. My knee popped twice, and I fell to the ground. The pain was horrible, and all I could do was wait the pain out. When then pain decressed I was helped up and taken to the dugout. I was barely able able to walk, and even sitting down I was still in pain. It took about 4 days for my to be able to walk without as much pain. I thought I was okay so I did not go see my doctor. I then went on vaction and my knee gave out, I was at the edge of the ocean with a drop off. When we came back I was sent to the doctors, because of what happened. They told me to rest my knee, and gave me a brace. They then sent me to PT, where they told me to stop wearing the brace. I still have to wear the brace when I am working, and I when I know I am going to be walking alot. When I flex my knee now my knee pops, and feels like bones moving across each other. I can also pop my knee in and out of place just by flexing it. I have pain when it is bent for more then two minutes, and I can't twist it. Which means I can not play softball this year. I was wondering what I should do, my knee seems to be getting worse because it is prone to twisting, and giving out.

"Hey
I am looking for some advice. I am 44 and last year l had 2 hip replacements and my left knee replaced. I also need my right replaced but needed a break from surgery and the tkr really hit me hard. I had it done in august. In the last few months l have been getting a terrible pain in my ankle on the same leg l have had both hip and knee replaced. Its so bad now l have been to doctors and he thinks l have ostioarthritis in my ankle now to. I am going for xrays on monday. But l think l have been overcompensating on the knee thats not been done because of the ankle and l am starting ti get bad pains in the knee thats needing done as well as the ankle in opposite leg.
I am trying to hold off as long as possible for next tkr due to work reasons.
Do any off you know if wearing a kneee support would help me? Would it give me any support and extra time until l get it replaced.
Please any advice would be great.

"I had my bilateral knee replacement in Feb 2016, Walking/climbing & getting down stairs is fine. I walk about 30 min both morning and evening, I stay on 2nd floor, so 2-3 times a day I go up and down. While doing all this I have no problem.
My problem is I can't stand still for a while, even while ironing my paint my knees get stiffer. I feel stiffness at the lower outer side of the knees ( that part i feel numb also) Though numbness is reducing. Initially the lower outer side of the knees getting stiff and slowly slowly both knees get stiff, then its difficult to raise my knees. This stiffness goes either by walking or sitting down for 5-10 min.
I met my OS (i.e one year post op visit), they had my X-rays and said everything is fine, but not able to tell me the cause of my problem. He said my operation is sucess my ROM (both leg ) is 120 degrees. and this problem will be there.
I am not satisfied with my OS, I visited another surgeon but he also not like to comment and prescribed me some medicines which are nothing but suppliments. Since my OS is a renowend Doctor and I feel so the other Doctor do not want to comment on his work. My operation was done by Dr. Ashok Rajgopal.
I want to know if someone else have this kind of problem.

"I had my surgery and it went great. I was worried about the nerve block, didn't feel a thing. Worried about the spinal, didn't even know they did it. I woke up in recovery with no nausea which I was also worried about. I am in very little pain today and I'm sure the block has worn off. Maybe not the cocktail they inject into the joint. I was warned that I could feel a jolt of pain when those wear off but staying on top of pain mess should help.
I was walking last night with pain. Today I walked with pain but the second time around it lessened. Pt was painful but necessary. My range of motion was 110 and o. Don't really know how to phrase that.
Anyway for those of you anxiously awaiting the surgery is nothing but I think the recovery will take patience. I'm already wanting to do things myself and it's the second day after surgery. I need to mentally slow down.
My husband has MS and I'm his primary caregiver. We have help while I recover but it's so hard to see him wanting to help me but he's unable to go much. This will be a trial but we believe in Joshua 1:9. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.""

"Hi all,
Back in here to whinge.
I had my TKR 12 months ago, mobility was ok bending was 100 , pain always there 4/10 some swelling. It overall happy
At 7 months I got sick with extreme pain and fever I associated it to the knee and went straight to the ED they aspirated the knee , I had to go to OT twice for clean up and synevectomyvwithnpoly exchange.They took 10 samples but nothing grew I never had fever again however my infection markers were extremely high, so it was decided by the infectious disease Dr that I would be treated for MRSA ( which i knew I had as I'm a nurse) home with PICC line for 6 weeks the. On oral antibiotics for 6 months , my infection markers came down , never normal, now it's going up again . I decided to stop antibiotics as my liver results were out as well!!
Saw Infectious Dr last week who reviewed my ultrasound that is showing fluid collection, I didn't tell her about stopping treatment just want to see the next blood result first .
I can walk , my bend went from 125 to 105 maybe due to fluid .
I still get swelling , stairs gives me a lit of pain especially going up.
Anyone has been trough a similar situation or has any advice? I feel that this is controlling my life , I love travelling and now I'm scared just in case I get sick in a foreign country
Thanks

"10 days ago my right knee kind of locked in the leg press. didnt feel any dislocation (like the knee going backwards) or any pain. I continued my training that day but was feeling kind of discomfort behind my knee like i pulled a muscle or something.
The following days the knee didn't swell at all, my muscles didnt loose any mass and the leg didnt loose any range of motion but was feeling a bigger discomfort (back of the knee)  with the extension when walking and running . deep squat and full range of motion ok.  knee feels weak however.
now the discomfort has been much better but not gone. i tried some bosu (one leg ) today also to test the knee with no big problems of stability. 
is it possible i tore an acl or pcl ? ?? 
would be difficult for me to stand on the bosu ? wouldnt i have some swelling?  
i have an appointment with the doctor in 7 days ...

"Hi there, Lauren here. I was playing in a high school basketball game two days ago when I was tripped and went airborne, eventually landing extremely hard on my left kneecap. The game paused and everyone was concerned, but I nervously and quickly stood up and played on. I fall in almost every game going for loose balls and steals. I've hit my knees hard many times this season and over the years of playing. But the pain has never been this bad. After falling, my kneecap swelled up immediately. I played the rest of the game with difficulty, pain, and a limp. The next day, my knee was immensely swollen and red and beginning to bruise. I limped around at the school and ended up having to sit out at the end of my practice because I am so slow and am moving with so much difficulty. My kneecap is extremely tender to touch, the feel of my sweatpants rubbing against it hurts so much. The kneecap hurts when I'm just laying down. When I limp, I keep my leg straight because I cannot bear to bend it. My mom is concerned, but my dad seems to think it's just a ""bone bruise"". I've had bruise knees since I started playing organized basketball at age 6, and I've really never felt such immense pain in one of my knees. Is it possible that I could have fractured my patella? Wondering if I should be getting X-Rays... Thanks all. PS - I've tried icing and Advil, still hurts and looks horribly.

"Hello to everyone, I have had 2 opinions from pain specialist that say I don't have crps. I had the kneecap replacement April 2016. My knee gives out and causes me to fall. Not only do I have fierce pain but the swelling is awful. My ortho dr drained it about 10 days ago. It was bloody and they sent it off to check for rheumatoid arthritis and etc. Everything was normal. So my Dr doesn't want to open it up to find out whats going on? I'm having a knee angiogram tomorrow. He said this would be a excellent test to determine if the meniscus is torn or if the cement is gone. However after reading up about the angiogram they will need to drain it if it has fluid in it and then put dye in there.10 days ago after he numbed it up and shoved that needle in there I flew up off that bed. It was not very nice. Whatever he touched with that needle is the pain I feel when I put weight on it. I have pulled my Achilles tendon in the other leg. It was almost gone til yesterday when I went to the store. It is back. My Dr has sent me to get these opinions and is now sending me to another ortho Dr just to have a new eyes on it. If he agrees with the total knee replacement then he will proceed. I been icing it and keeping it elevated. However not much fluid goes down? Also something strange is going on. After I wake up in the morning and get to moving around I'm starting to feel like something inside the knee is I can feel like something is running down my knee? It almost feels like when you run warm water over your hands? I don't know what's going on with all of this but I'm so tired. I'm hoping I get some answers soon. I'm sleep deprived and I hurt so bad. I honestly think that my other leg has had about enough too. Thanks,Tina

"This is a reply for Knewneeh.
I had SCT on both my knees in April and I am responding to Knewneeh from another discussion.  I don't know how recovery differs with a knee injury and osteoarthritis but I was bone on bone in my right knee that that strengthens by the day now.  Your exercising sounds ideal - just gradually build up as the strengthening lets you.  It is a gradual process as the stem cells grow so the main thing is to take it gradually and not overdo it initially.  I don't know what your work is but if you are standing all day I think I could do that but not hop,skip,jumping!  Hope this is helpful.  Best wishes for your recovery and please keep us informed of your progress.

"Other people do little to exercise after surgery outside of the P/T provided.  I decided eary on to take the approach of non-weight bearing exercise like swimming and bike riding.  At right about 6 months I needed to go back to the gym. My muscles were loosing definition, I was week and I started doing the same exercises on weight machines and moderate weights like I did before I had the surgery.  No improving.  Still swelling, soreness, weakness, and the knee locks up. Others prefer no exercise to stress the joint . I find the more I do that I am more confident but suffer greatly when I stopp. So Wbat I try to do is find a comfort zone.  I bike ride to loosen up but soon after I am right back to where I began. Stiff and swollen. I'm frustrated because I know I need to exercise to get better. Others say not to overdo and do as little as possible but do ordinary things.Results seem to be mixed. So I am going to do what my body tells me to do to see if not doing anything quiets things down so I can enjoy ordinary life without too much discomfort.  So far it is not working. After sleep I feel better but soon after I am worse than before. Any thoughts on this approach?

"I had my left TKR in July and had awful nerve pain but thanks to this forum and the marvellous Chico I realised it was par for the course but drove through and got full straightening and bending. I was dreading my right TKR but was offered a cancellation on 29th November and went for it. The nerve pain was not so bad and I actually managed to get some sleep which was such a relief. Again I have full straightening and bending. The pain I am left with on both knees is at the front of my kneecap, the pain in my right knee is still excrutiating when I stand up, I can only drive short distances  and I am still going upstairs one foot at a time. I have been very down wondering why the pain is not diminishing. The consultant has told me it is because the tendon that goes across the front of the knee has not recovered yet and it will take time but how long and can you exercise a tendon?. My lovely GP has signed me off until 10/4 so I am not panicking about getting better to go back which was part of my anxiety. I was wondering why I had this pain, which is so slow to improve no matter what exercises i do to try to aid recovery. They dont tell you details of what they do during the op but my problem was that both my kneecaps had slipped out of alignment and had become very worn away, I had no cartilidge left  and they were actually digging into the bone. My theory is and I wonder if anyone can enlighten me, that they had to pull and stretch my tendons out of the way so they could repair my knee caps. I think if I had a logical answer as to why I am not improving I could handle it better. Sorry to ramble on but would be grateful for any thoughts

"I am interested in hearing from those who have passed the 10 week post-op milestone. I am averaging 5,000 steps (used to average 10,000). I am sore/achey most days. I keep waiting to reach the magic moment when I say I'm glad I did the TKR. I know it's irrational, but I worry this is as good as it will get. I'm back to my job as an elementary school principal. My mind keeps going and there's a lot I want to do after work, but I pretty much just crash and burn. I know part of the problem is my other knee - it needs a TKR also. I just can't get in the frame of mind I need to go through this again. I have an appointment with my surgeon in 2 weeks. I believe he will be able to give me a cortisone injection in the unoperated knee. I'm hoping that will get me through the next few months and help me hold off surgery until October.

I try to do what I always used to do but I am held back by my 'awkward' knee. 
It hurts when I walk and I limp. The more I walk the worse it goes.
I was held back from being abke to do a lot iof tge exercuses early in as the  swelling was so bad. I joined the gym, did water exercises but the more I did the worse my knee became so I held off.
The swelling had now gone down and I am going back to the gym. 
What I would like to ask is: Will sports physio help? I have spoken to a physio and he said he will give massage to my knee and leg.I am worried this will make it worse.
At seven months have I left it too late to do a lot more physio? I don't want to make it worse.
I would apprecate any advice you can give me.Thank you.

"I read forum all the time, and I love the guidance.  I'm a 72-y/o lady.  I've been doing PT 2 - 3 times a week.  My issue now is I've lost enthusiasm.  For first few visits PT guy was wonderful.   Got into my knee so well, felt like he was playing a stringed instrument.  After that I was passed to another guy.  We do the same exercises every time, and I have to ask him to measure.  I have ins. that allows 75 visits per year.  I'm starting to have a crisis of faith in the process.  Should I take my business elsewhere?  I don't feel comfortable demanding first guy who is also owner treat me.  I haven't done any exercises at home all week bc of this, and my knee is no worse, nor any better.

My left knee stays with a six/seven level. I do PT 2/3 times per week. Recently a small white circle has appeared on the left side of patellar causing a pain level of 7 . I've had continual pain 24/7 since surgery.
Any comments as to the white spot on knee causing pain?

"Hi all
Just a wee update at the 3wk mark, pain remains around 3 on the 1-10 scale now, and increases to 4-5 after exercise . Still on Solpadol  30/500 since leaving hospital .
I have now started walking with one crutch which is going pretty well, still cannot walk properly without that support, and still undergoing physio once a week
Rom is 0- to just over 90 degrees, up 10 on last week. I have noticed I am getting a lot more hip pain ( due to be replaced next , and the timing to be discussed with my Consultant at the 6 wk appointment)
So all in all pretty happy with how it's all going, I still get very tired even after walking say 300 yards, but guess it's very early still and my body is likely still trying to get over the surgery.

"I'm seriously looking into the Aircast cryo cuff, but also the type that isn't connected to the tub where you just change the frozen sachet (my husband will be very happy to swap sachets if he saves that much money LOL!).  But there are a couple of questions - I'm assuming that the compression aspect helps reduce pain and swelling, so this is an advantage over just ice?  BUT some of the cuff obviously goes over the area where it's been cut.  Does this cause problems, or should you wait until the skin is healed before using any compression over it?  Many thanks!

"Hello! I am 8 weeks post right TKR-- I am 6 months post left TKR and 3 years post left hip replacement and am just 42 years old. The major US hospital I have used has NEVER had me in PT with any of my surgeries- they have given me a sheet of things to do at home and I have done them. Without seeing the scar I can amazingly say I would never know my hip was replaced. My left knee can fully bend and straighten-- but on occasion yet It does let me know if it doesn't like a movement I make- but the discomfort goes away right away. My right knee now though is SO different. My bend is very good and I can fully straighten it- the slight discover in that part is the same as my other knee. I have a fair amount of what I call ""charlie horse"" type pain in my knee and leg as I had with the other one.. but this time it is going on alot longer. What concerns me and I have spoken with my surgery team about it and they are puzzled as to why I am experiencing this. As before my TKR I would get a very tight- painful feeling in my knee-- I would barely be able to put pressure (step on the leg) on it and it felt like it was going to give out on me. With that-- the handful of days I have had this occurance- I get redness and slight purplish bruising that shows up across the bottom half of my knee into my front lower leg (about a sauce plate size) this feeling goes on for several hours-- then slowly will subside. The bruising takes a couple of days to fully go away. The surgical team says nothing in my x-rays show why this should be happening- they are baffeled by it-- and are just chalking it up as part of this knees healing process. I go back to work in 1 week- I am on my feet all day.. This knee was in very bad shape when they replaced it- I know I am probably going back too soon- but I need my job and with 2 knee replacement within 1 year- the choice is no longer mine as to how long I can be gone. I am worried about what has been happening-- I don't sleep well at night-- the constant aching in my knee and leg keeps me up. I don't take stong pain killers anymore- but do take a muscle relaxer-- I do see swelling off and on in the knee- and it is always hot to the touch. I know every replacement is different- and don't expect the sucess I had so quickly in the first TKR. I don't know if the pain will ever fully go away in either knee- but it is much better than how I started out. I am just very worried about this strange occurance I have been experiencing several times in the past 5 weeks. Any thoughts would be very appreciated. Sorry for the ""book"" story here-- just haven't been able to ""talk"" with anyone going through TKR at all until I came upon your Discussion group- Thank-you for being here!!

"Hello,
6yrs ago I fully tore my left ACL and had it reconstructed after partially tearing my right ACL and avoiding the surgery as the consultant said that it should be ok. I've had a few niggles over the years however today I've done something quite painful to my right knee.
At the end of a long quite leg qorianted fitness circuit I ran around a sharp right hand corner and felt a small pop in the back of my right knee. It didn't give way & I'm able to hobble on it. It happened about 8hrs ago & hasn't swollen up. The pain is in the bottom half of the knee, just to the right of the centre. It hurts to touch it, walking and fully straightening it and it obviously feel unstable.
Does anyone on here have any ideas what I could have done?

When I walk, at random times my knee feels like it moves out of place and I cannot put weight on it then i just shake it and it feels back to normal. No pops or lingering pain. I weight lift so I squat a lot of the time with somewhat large amounts of weight.

"I few years ago I woke up and had minor pian in the muscles around the quads of BOTH knees. I am usually limber and could alway touch my heel to my butt. Now it feels like as if a tennis ball were placed behind my knee. More pain if I force heel to butt. Finally went to knee doctor who diagnosed me with osteoarthritis. We did the steroid shots. Ths seemed to take care of muscle area but making joint pain  worse.Then we did the hyaluronan injections. This did nothing at all except now It is very painful to get araoung. Joint reaaly hurt. Remembering his comment on x-rays, he mentioned that I was a mess. Bone on bone, spurs....I later  I thought that is what the neck doctor said too, but my neck feels fine and never had a problem. Now thinking RA or something else. What does anyone else think and what is the next step? Just to add, I feel into a deep sleep after taking antihisimines. I woke up  with lower back off the mattress hick is on floor. There is pain there when I bend to a certain spot. I have been to Chriopractors with no results.

Let's hope it stays that way, I know it's a hard slog but it was amazing to wake up from the op with just a dull ache instead of that roaring pain I had last time.

"I WISH I WOULD NO LONGER HAVE DAILY LEFT KNEE/LEG PAIN.
I have had 3 total knee replacements to date and 5 major knee surgeries on my left knee. My knee doesn't even feel quite like my right leg does which i would call very normal. my pain level can get very high, up to a 7 or 8 daily. My last knee replacement was last June 2016, 7 months ago. my right knee replacement went fantastic. I did get an infection in my left knee and went through a ton of stuff because of that staph infection. I have been told by one of my Ortho surgeons; that at one point after the infection was better but pain was a 9, horrible to live with, that at this point its called a knee gone bad. So, the Ortho surgeon took out my first knee replacement for 3 months and more major IV antibiotics called a Pic line as well for two months of the three. so I finally get my 2nd replacement and months out it all got loose!!!! Back to surgery for the third replacement or possible amputation. I got a third knee replacement. Yet. I in terrible pain daily and live on pain medication and sometimes that med works and other times it only takes the edge off for a short time. Is anyone out there with simular issues.

"Hello to all, I had my pkr in April 2016. I started off having quite a bit of issues a few months back. Knew was giving out and causing me to fall and injuring other things. My knee snaps,pops and grinds. I was told this was normal with the kneecap replacement. So I kept complaining about the pain,difficulty sleeping and being able to just sit down and get up.I have become very depressed. I have had 2 opinions from pain Dr's that say I don't have crps.Both Drs thought that this was being pushed off and was not gonna diagnose me with crps because they didn't believe that's what was wrong.10 says ago I had my knee drained because I'm also dealing with moderate swelling. All blood off the knee was sent off to test and everything was fine. Yesterday I had a arthogram. So my present Dr sent me to have a new Dr take a look at things,just for a second opinion. They found on the arthrogram and ct that Medial Articular Cartilage Delamation was 6mm x 15mm. This new Drs taste of words were not very good. He said it wasn't time for a tkr and a scope with debridement and microfiber drilling could be beneficial. However after leaving the office I read my clinic notes. He has said I was being over dramatic and believed that my injury is part of the pain but doesn't think that it's all related to that injury. I'm satisfied with his decision in not having a tkr right now and I'm fine with a scope. The issue is I have complained for months about the great deal of pain and suffering I have endured. Yet I was told the xrays look very good. I'm happy to know that this was not in my head. How can a doctor say someone is being dramatic? My knee hurts, it's swollen and they was poking around on it yesterday. It's a little tender. When he picked my leg up and grabbed it around my ankle and my knee dropped was excruciating pain. Was I suppose to smile and say that it felt good? Sorry about ranting and making this so long. I just want other people advise on what should I do? Plus this new Dr said that I'm not far from needing a tkr. He said let's see if you get any relief from the other surgery? I'm not a guinea pig and I'm tired of being sent here and there for this and that. It's wearing me out physically and mentally. Thanks for any info.

Horrible pain after PT. Saw the doc for a routine f/u. The knee was hot and could not be touched. ""It's a painful surgery Jeanne"" he said. I wondered what was wrong with me that I couldn't tell do it. Went back at 6 weeks....told doc pain was worse, not better. ""It's a painful surgery Jeanne""...... I cried and grew depressed because I was a wimpy loser. Then my wound broke open and started draining.....no worries, doc said. You reacted to the glue....""why not at the rest of the incision?"" I said. I've seen this before, my pompous surgeon replied. I debridided like he said.....got the wound closed. ""But it hurts so much, I think it's infected"" I said......""it's difficult to diagnose an infection"" he said. I puked, I couldn't eat or sleep, 'y hair fell out, my eyelashes fell out. One day I could not put ANYweight on my leg....went to the ER. This is INFECTED, they said. Took the joint out and placed me in an immobilizer for 4 months with a PICC line for IV antibiotics. Then started all over with a new knee in August, 2014. Recovery all over again, neuropathy, PTSD anorexia and weakness. My other knee? It's now ruined but it will be a cold day in hell before I do it again.

"Hello there,
I'm now 7 days post surgery and can still only bend to 75 degrees. I was discharged at 4 days with very little Physio input as my pain was not under control during my stay. In fact, the pain was horrendous and I am now home with morphene. However, I am really encouraged today by how much the pain has rapidly improved over the last 24 hours and I am now able to straighten well, weight bare and walk with just a stick (I was discharged 3 days ago in a wheelchair).
I am, however, terrified by the slow progress I have made with bending. I am concerned that I may never get there. The knee itself no longer hurts when I bend, but the muscles above and to the side seems to be locked. Thebknee itselfnis swollen and feels tight. I am only 37 and otherwise fit and active. I'm so scared that I may never recover as I have read and been told by many disappointed nurses that this stage of recovery is extremely important. I feel tired, worried and a failure.
Did anyone else have this problem and go on to make a good recovery?
Many thanks

"7 weeks post tka with patella resurface. Off crutches working on balance. Had a huge Valgus deformity and synovectomy with release of synovial fluid at time of op. I have osteoarthritis as well as Rheumatoid. Doing all my rehab exercises flexion about 100 and extension 10. Now progressed to 10 minute stints on static bike. Knee still hot but past week top of knee feels a bit tethered , tight and prickly is this normal. I was wondering if it was scar tissue forming despite rigidly sticking to regime?

"I am 6 weeks post op and although most of my worst pain is gone, I have developed a very uncomfortable sensitivity along my scar line and the entire knee cap area. The tenderness is so painful that I cannot put any pressure on the area. Sleeping is no longer comfortable. I have been massaging with vitamin E cream to soften the tightness in the skin, but it does not help. Chico Marx recommends Voltaren, which I am also using. Is this sensivity and pain I feel now something I should have expected? What else can I do?

"I am trying hard to remember what I was like before this TKR in February last year but one things for sure I had a lot more energy and zest for life than I do now!
I feel like I've been to war and have forgotten what I'm supposed to be fighting for. Admittedly I did have terrible knee pain but it could be controlled with drugs and creams.
I wanted stem cell but foolishly though because that could take a year a TKR would be better because it would be quicker.
I've suffered tremendously since the TKR and can't really walk properly now and my balance is all wonky
I've developed other problems as well such as a cyst on my finger and pains in my side. At one time I could be tired in the morning say but could make energy as the day went on. Now if I'm tired I just get worse.
I feel like I've aged 100 years - never in a million years did I realise it would be like this. I'm seeing the surgeon next month and wonder if anybody has any questions I should put to him

I've tried sticking the leg out that will be operated on and putting most weight on the other leg and arms but I can't get up like that!  When they tell you to put the operated leg out in front, can you still put weight on it?  Is it just that there's less chance of damage with it out straight or is it that they don't want you to put weight on it?

"In Jan 2016, after my 32nd overseas trip, I returned home to Sydney, pretty much unable to walk without dragging my right knee and walking with a stick. Pain was part of my life. I slept 2-3 hours a night and medicated with Panadeine Forte (Paracetamol and 30 mg codeine) around 6 per day and 200 mg of Celebrex antiinflammatory daily.
I begged for my knees to be replaced. Both of them were bone on bone and I was in a very bad place at just 63 years of age. 7 years prior I had taken up running and boxing and felt about as fit and happy as I ever have. Then my knees packed it in. Osteoarthritis in hips, feet, hands and knees.
In early February 2016 I rang my Specialist surgeon who I had been in contact in every 6 months, so as to delay my inevitable knee replacements and begged for an appointment. His Receptionist fitted me in and I saw him late February 2016. He said he could do my operation quickly if I paid $6,000 and I explained that this was two business class airfares to London from Sydney and I would take my chances with the Public system and have him supervising one of the top 1% of students who train as registrars at Sydney's best Orthopedic hospital. Call me a miser but I had faith. Faith in myself, faith in the Surgeon and faith in the system. Still do.
The system let me down by not caring for me whilst I was in hospital or on discharge but the supervising surgeon and the registrar who actually removed my damaged bones and replaced them with plastic and metal devices, did me a huge favour. HUGE.
I am not yet perfectly healed BUT life is so much finer than it was. For me, I hated how I felt in the first few months post surgery. Then slowly, after 10 months I feel darn good. I am back at the Gym, with my sister who underwent a knee replacement Sept 6 2016. We are doing it for ourselves. As a renowned and knowledgeable person here says, ""never give up"". I say ""fake it until you make it. Get on with it"". It's up to you to heal yourself. Eat well. Keep the weight down. Do the work and your time will come too.
Hugs from me here. x

"I am 8 weeks post op of total knee replacement and have ongoing calf pain on operative leg. In fact the more active i become, the worse the pain.
My understanding is the muscle contracted due to improper movement caused by arthritic bent knee (20°) for almost a year before surgery. My permanently bent knee made me limp. I was hoping this would be corrected post op.
The calf pain was almost as intense as the surgical healing pain in first 2 weeks post op. I was even sent to hospital to rule out blood clot as my calf had protruding lump which turned out to be knot in tissue. My surgeon prescribed valium as a muscle relaxant. I think it helped but hard to tell as everything was painful for me for the first 5 weeks. I think my hair even hurt.
I went off valium and dilaudid in week 5 as my gi system was in shreds. I am progressing in ROM. Best straight measurement so far is 2° with manipulation. 125° bent.
I find when I walk for 20 minutes or more the calf muscle tightness pain flares. Nothing relieves it. Not Heat, ice, tylenol, massage, tens unit. Only time without walking.
I feel I'm in a catch 22 with no end in sight. I need to walk to (re?) lengthen calf muscle, strengthen quads, improve gait and not go insane staying in this house. But my still bent knee prevents calf release and in fact worsens pain. And tightened calf muscle prevents knee from fully straightening!
I'm curious if others have had similar experience and what was outcome.
Hopefully I am just, as my husband calls me, the most impatient patient, and this will sort out in...time.

"After a long wait for the first of two planned op's for me, my TKR went ahead last Wednesday ( UK)  And I have to say I have not found the experience so far that bad at all. 
Now i don't think I am any braver than anyone else, but in comparison to bone grafts, and breaking my femur, Tib/Fib, this so far has been easier.
I had a GE ( due to spinal issues) and a nerve block which lasted around 6 hrs after the op. The first night was uncomfortable, but never agony, and physio was started on day two getting just over 50% but had real difficulty raising my leg at first, but slight improvement later. 
So far very happy with how things are going despite a wee set back today ( icing a bit more as swellings increased today) 
Hopefully things continue slowly improving of the next few weeks, my Consultant has already said we will discuss the next Op ( THR) same leg at the 6-8wk mark.
So all in all, glad I have had it done, and looking forward to slow gains over the coming weeks. Pain at present is ranging between 2- 5 on the scale with 30/500 Codeine / paracetamol

"Hi. 6 weeks tomorrow. Knew I was having a difficult recovery. Nightmare pain levels. Nerve pain better- don't scream when the sheet touches my leg. Home pt for 5 weeks. Stiffness and swelling every morning.
SO.... Went to Sharp Rehabilitation Center Coronado, CA today for evaluation and outpatient pt. Took 2mg Dilaudid AND a Vicodin. Therapist was shocked. Could barely do anything today because of my pain level. Home therapist told me I was Zero- straight leg and 93 degrees flexion one week ago. Today I measured at -12 and 84 degrees???
Did testing and my mobility level was 22 - was told at this stage should be around 10. Considered serious fall risk.
Therapist said I presented like a patient 2 weeks after TKR.
PLEASE READ... Told her about my problems with my foot. Was like a dead fish when I was discharged. Concentrated on wiggling toes and... Nothing. Finally got some very little movement in the foot. She said that is NOT normal. Now wants me to be evaluated for hairline fracture and/or nerve damage.
Was told to stop walking except for bathroom and given 4 exercises to do EVERY 30 min. Says you only have a 6 week window to get most flexion and extension.
Most Shocking.... Was utterly shocked when I described excercises done with home therapy. She said that is the basic exercises you do for 2 weeks after discharge and then you start ""real physical therapy""
Sorry this is so long... Really worried now. Have to be back at work in 5 weeks.
Please tell me if you had any foot problems after surgery and describe it.

"Hello to all, I have had several knee surgeries in the past year. Patella femoral realignment , lateral bands cut . April 2016 I had a knee cap replacement on left knee. I been having problems right off the get go. I have had numerous conversations here with all these issues. I have swelling,pain,popping,snapping and my legs are on fire once Iay down. I rarely get a good nights sleep. Pain keeps me up all hours of the night. I been complaining to my Dr through out this journey. My knee gives out on me and down I go. I have injured my shoulder and collar bone in the process. No Mri can be performed due to the metal. I have had a bakers cyst for quite some time and its continuing to get bigger. I woke up this morning and my balance and legs were in pain as usual. I didn't think to much about it. I started noticing my baker cyst was hurting really bad and it seemed bigger. I took pain medicine and didn't get any relief. Then I noticed my knee was swelled 3 times bigger as other knee. So I went to e.r. The pain was awful. I couldn't bend it or bear weight. The ultrasound showed arthritis, fluid everywhere and the bakers cyst measured 4.5 X 1.6 X 3.5. The hospital did blood work and everything was fine. They would not drain it in spite of the pain. Told me to call ortho first thing tomorrow morning. My ortho says I'm too young for a tkr and believes my kneecap replacement was a failure. I read my E.R report and its says I'm not compliant with not wearing crutches. First of all My shoulder is messed up,my right knee is messed up and needs surgery, plus the left leg is in bad shape . To top that off I pulled my Achilles tendon in my right calf. How are you suppose To put weight on 2 bad legs and a messed up shoulder and collar bone? It's very painful to say the least. I need some serious help and need some guidance of what needs to be done. I feel like I'm getting the run around and xrays look good, so he doesn't think theres much left to do. Is it normal to fall,severe joint effusions,pain interupted sleep and injuries due to falling? Is there something wrong with this picture? Im tired of it all and sbout lose my mind. My pain dr wont even touch this leg. That is pretty bad to say. Any help would be awesome. Thanks, Tina

Doctor says next step are these Hyaluronic Shots, 5 shots over the course of 5 weeks. Says these can help for months at a time and can postpone the surgery. 
This has the potential for financial hardship as each office visit costs money out of pocket. I'm not sure that it is worth the money.

It doesn't hurt really, it just makes me aware. It happens probably 10 out of 12 steps. At the same time my left hip (same side as my TKR knee) became a little tender from time to time. I visited my chiropractor and told him my left knee feels like it's longer. He checked it out and said yes it is a little longer. He made an adjustment and told me not to worry it might settle down. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I'm back to modified yoga and walking on my treadmill 20 mins a day alternately with my stationary bike. The hot tub has become my new best friend!

"hello,i would like opinions on whether or not i can safely carry on with back exercises with my two new knees.
the exercises are the ones advocated by Robin McKenzie in his book ""treat your own back"" and i specifically refer to the one where you lie completely flat,face down,totally relaxed and then push up with your hands and do a half press up. This bends the spine and helps reinforce the Lordosis.
i have found this procedure extremely helpful in keeping my sciatica at bay and wish to carry on with it.
the question is,will my knees be ok for this?
What think you,o people of the forum?
i should add i used to be terribly afflicted with sciatica,until this book saved my life.

"I'm 19 years old and have never had any knee problems until about a month ago when it all started. I woke up and the inner side and back of my right knee and above and below my kneecap was swollen and in pain. The pain is worse when my leg is straight, or very bent. It is most comfortable slightly bent. The pain also increases when I touch the swelling. There is no difficulty moving my leg or any stiffness, just pain during movement. There is no redness and there is the occasional click or popping sound, less than once a day. I went to my GP who thought it was arthritis and sent me to hospital. Had blood tests and x-rays done and I was told it's all clear and likely to be growing pains (I haven't grown in years!). I had a second opinion and this GP told me it was patellar/general tendonitis and told me to use heat, ice and gave me some exercises to do.
It is now over a week later and after heat and ice the swelling above my knee has reduced slightly. The pain remains the same as before and increases when the leg is very bent or straight and is still sore to touch. Although the swelling has generally reduced, what's noticeable is the swelling at the back of my knee, the inner side and below my kneecap.
Does anyone have any ideas on what it could be, I fear it could actually be arthritis, or what should I do to stop the pain and swelling.

"My left knee has been swollen since January 2016, almost a year now, I just remember it aching one day, which was really bad when I crouched, I thought nothing of it and expected the pain to go away but in the next few days it swelled up heavily. I wore shorts throughout the winter last season if that plays any factor?
The swelling went down a little bit but then returned in August, 2016 and has since gone down (but it has never completely healed), the family doctor ordered an xray, blood tests, and ultrasound and couldn't find anything wrong.
I was sent to specialist who ordered an MRI which won't be done for another 10 months, what is wrong with my knee? I am only 20 years old, and I did not injure anything in it, no pain when walking, however there is sometimes a sharp pain when I straighten my left leg after sitting down.

"At last after 2 years and 3 months I am going back in 6th Feb to have a knee revision as apparently the scan showed the prosthesis was too small.
I know this is a more complex operation this time and there is more chance of my leg breaking.
Has anyone else had a knee revision?
How long was the healing process compared to the original TKR?
They've said I will be in 5-7 days.
I've split with my partner recently. I know I will have carers coming in at first for hygiene reasons.
I'm hoping to hire someone to make food and do a bit of cleaning. Will I get any funding help with this?

"I had a TKR back in November 14 and now having major pain with it.  Been to hospital and had two bone scans both which show nothing wrong with the metal or cement or any loosening.  The pain in my knee is getting worse. The only thing the surgeon thinks the problem could be are the ligaments loosening.  This being the case he may need to do a revision.  Only problem now is that my hip on the same leg needs doing too and the surgeon says that this needs doing first as the hip will not cope with the knee exercises for the revision.  Seem to be caught between a rock and a hard place.  Do I have the hip replaced and hope the pain in the knee fades or should I have the knee done.  Either way the pain in my knee is getting worse.  I have been prescribed naproxen but notice now that it is not touching the pain. Any advice most welcome. Waiting for a steroid injection for the hip and this helps the knee too. Getting fed up now of hobbling around.

"Hello,
?A brief history. I saw teh GP in 2012 for knee pain, had physio and then cortisone injections which didn't give a great deal of relief. Went to surgery for arthroscopy and microfracture in 2013 which was not a success - left me in a worse condition. Had the right knee done in 2014 for the same which has worked.  Had more cortisone and hyaloronic (sp?) after for left knee then left knee re-done for arthroscopy and microfracture (surgeon said the first op hadn't worked when he looked) in Jan and was a bit better. I fel tthat I'd gone back to where I was before the first op. )The first op left me in bad pain and a terrible ""graunching"" when I applied pressure through it (like depressing the clutch in the car) it was also ""catching"" on something inside. He also cut out a fatty pad(?).
?So forward on to this year and it has deteriorated again. My knee constantly hurts. I take co-codamol which doesn't really do anything also norytryptyline at night to help with nerve ending pains. At night my knee feels like it is on fire and during the day it is a constant grinding ache. I also use Voltarol gel to get some topical relief.
?I went back to the GP who referred me to musculoskeletal clinic as he felt they might be able to offer some more conservative treatment. He felt if he referred me to a consultant they woudl just go for surgery.
?So I went to clinic, had xrays, the Dr there said I'd had a lot of work done already and there wasn't anything he could really do. I have osteoarthritis and he recommends a partial knee replacement. I'm off for MRI and he has referred me to consultant.
?Whilst I don't want a PKR I feel I have to do something to try to get rid of the pain. I'm 53. I have an active job that I need to be able to get up and down off the floor for (I work with disabled children in the community). I have to be able to carry equipment and drive.
?Is this really the only solution? Like I say I don't necessarily want it but I can't see the other options.

"I am 8wks out bilateral pkr. Roller coaster emotionally/physically. This forum saved me at 3wks out. I walked 1st day po. Had some bleeding complications but iced and elevated NONSTOP. I used the CPM all night, never in day, for 3weeks. Each time i got up to bathroom, i swapped cpm to other leg. I had a lot of scar tissue. Finally week4 most of it broke loose-endless rubbing and wriggling it around like an obsessive crazy person,lol. I quit walker at 3 weeks. Pain meds 24/7first 2 weeks, night only for next 2.5wks. Advil only now. 0/-1 extentions and 124/128 readings at 6wks. I'd lose flexion after workouts because of swelling. PT 2x/wk. BUT i push at home, small bike peddles ($20 i started day 3), already owned a treadmill (.5-1mile 2x a day started at wk 6) and i use a stretchy band for leg AND hip exercises. I spend more time stretching than exercising. All the grabby, toothache feelings in my knees usually feel better AFTER exercises even if swelling persists. I've cried through MANY sessions knowing it was the SCAR tissue that i was breaking up and if i didnt do it now, later would be worse...I used saran wrap around knees at night(only) a few times when the sensitivity was so bad the sheets made me crazy. The nerve gets cut and as sensitivity returns-sometimes it never comes back- it seems SUPER-sensitive! LACK OF SLEEP night after night made me nuts, irritable, frustrated and magnified ALL the recovery process. When i slept, i was ""normal"". Sleep in 3hr blocks didnt come until week 6. All the swelling in my legs, wks 0-6, would shift when i laid down at night and make me have to go to the bathroom every 1-1.5hr!
My endurance is better. Week one i could barely put the pillowcases on wo being tired. I now can do 2 loads of wash, change the sheets, bake cookies, wash the floors and do my exercises. BUT I have to rest and elevate (legs still get some swelling) for 20-30 min increments. I still get tight muscles and soreness and aches in knees,hips and pelvis but I've come to realize THE MORE I DO, THE MORE I ENGAGE MORE MUSCLES that were not used and got VERY WEAK very fast.
Sorry so long. But everything you guys wrote SAVED me mentally. I got so depressed and even when i knew the surgery was necessary, i cursed it, cried and wanted to quit. It seemed like most people said the 5-6 week period things improved. They do, but NOT PERFECT EVERY DAY!!! Know this. But the good days get more, and the strength gets better. I still cant go down stairs normally but i can go up!
I hope i gave someone hope like you all did me. Ps. I lost 34lbs b4 my surgery, i was still overwt but the doc knew i could do it. Find someone who lets you vent, believes in you and BELIEVE IN YOURSELF! We can do it!

"Hey
I had my left knee reolaced in august and my right needs dine to and will. Be getting done this year sometime. I had both hips reolaced at the start of last year as l sufffer from OA. But just recently l have been having terrible pain in my ankles especially the leg l have had both hip and knee reolaced. Is this normal or am l getting OA in my anckles to. I have also noticed l an getting more back pain. Its really hard fir me to walk at the moment a lot harder than it was a month or 2 after knee replacement. Has anyone else experienced this? Should l be going to see my gp about. Could the cold weather be making it worse as l stay in scotland and its always cold. Am worried my life is just going to get harder as time passes which it is just now. Its my birthday this minth aand am 44 but my bidy feel 74. I have had to give up full time work and ny sleep pattern is still all over the place. I sleep on the couch half the night most nights fir past year. I think i soon will have to give up working completly. I have lost the persin l was abd l don't think she will ever be back now. Have a pip assesment next week which by reading about it seems terrifing it took me so long to do the form and gather ás much information as l could and by reading other peoples experiences l have ni chance and l will just cry in the assesment as l will be so worked up. And if they say no l will be devastated as l out so much time and effort into it. I will appeal but see what hapoens. This is my life now its nit great being in constant pain and miserable and feel si bad fir my husband as its affected his life so much to l simetimes think he would be better off without me. This certainly was not what l exoected my life to be at 43.
Any help about my ankles would be great.

"Hi, I'm 5 weeks post op for right knee replacement and it feels like it's been a roller coaster. I'd been told to expect pain but managed with codeine for the first couple of weeks. Quickly managed without crutches and leg seemed to be bending ok. Pretty op it was knock kneed and I had expected it to come out straight so that was the first disappointment. I'm now 5 weeks post op and the pain if anything seems to be worse especially at night. Seem to be on a plateau and feeling quite despondent. Maybe my expectations were too high or my surgeon didn't prepare me enough of what to expect, I think the latter. I get a burning pain on the inside of my knee which stops me sleeping and a dull ache during the day. I'm very stiff on getting up and can hardly walk and almost as bad after sitting in a chair for 30 mins. Everyone says how well I'm doing so it seems churlish to say I'm actually quite miserable and feeling on the edge of being depressed. Am I expecting too much too soon, can anyone please tell me their experience if similar. Thanks Maggie.

So...I laid off the exercising and just did basic leg stretches and knee bends at home.
I live in a bungalow and I am seventy seven, not a youngster anymore.
I am getting depressed as I thought I should be practically pain free by now but I'm not. Today I am getting a sickening bone pain from my knee down my shin bone and pain at the back of my leg.
Quite a few people I have met who have had TKR tell me I should be pain free now as they were.  
My question is....should I go back to the gym and get on the bike? 
I get no advice from the doctor and I don't see any physio.I am just left to my own devices.I feel as though this is it and I will never enjoy my walks in the country and walks by the sea again.
Any advice at this stage would be appreciated. Thank you.

Lately I have been having pain at night in both legs and in my knee and it's still so stiff. I no long take pain meds, just Tylenol. Is there something stronger that would help with my pain? I also use a topical cream but don't feel it helps much.

"I completed all of my labs, xrays, EKG, and consult  with my surgeon. All I'm waiting on is my primary physician to see me tomorrow to give final clearance for surgery on January 31st. I am having a revision done on my original TKR from July 12, 2016. The plastic piece between the prosthetic wasn't thick enough to tighten loose ligaments on the outside of my knee. They're going to go in and remove plastic, clean up and check prosthetic, then insert a new thicker piece of plastic. Yall pray for me a great recovery.

"Well today felt fairly momentous. I drove for the first time.  Didn't go too far and it was fine.  I had no idea how knee replacement would affect me in so many ways.   It feels like a huge journey and it's only been seven weeks so far.   I foolishly thought that I would go in, have the op, come out do a few exercises and get over the op and be back to 'normal'.   I'm walking well, no real sign of limp but I'm walking so slowly (slow snails pace!).   I think a huge amount of positive mental attitude and determination is needed to get back to living life. I don't think I will be the same person again as I know my fitness levels will improve and I will continue to make exercise a huge part of my life.  I don't think I will ever take anything for granted again!  And I certainly look at people with walking canes etc.in a different way - you just never know what people are going through.   Who else feels this is life changing in more ways than one?

"I had a TKR on November 1 and a surgery on my wrist on December 9. The surgery on my wrist has became infected. I remember something about infections and TKR but can't remember all of it. It's Saturday and I'm wondering if I can wait until Monday to see a doctor or if I need to go to urgent care tomorrow? It's draining and I've put on antibiotic ointment and a bandage is this enough?

"I've done a lot of posting on this site, trying to overcome my own situation by encouraging people to be strong and do the work necessary to get well again.  Now it's my turn.  I expected something, it didn't happen and now I have to confront it.
I'm at 8 1/2 months.  ROM is 0 / +132, overcame some severe sciatica starting in week 5, got off all the meds and walking aids, hit the gym for the quads.  Thought I was done at 7+ months...boy was I wrong...
While looking for a new position in IT (45 years...Sr. Process/Solutions Architect), I thought I'd work P/T at the local Best Buy selling computers for the holidays.  Heck, I've built all my own machines for decades and know all the technology intimately.  This was an easy choice to get back into the working world.  So I stopped the gym and went to work.  Baaaaad idea...
Standing on my feet for between 5 and 8 1/2 hours a day, I've realized that my quads are still too weak to do the time.  Day starts off horribly but I get stronger over the day until I get home and just collapse.  I need to get back to the gym on my off days and do more quad work but I'm just really tired.  I thought that working and walking (7,000 to 10,000 steps a day on my FitBit) would rehab the quads.  WRONG!!!!  Gotta get back to the leg work.  There is really no alternative.  I had to learn the hard way and pay for my arrogance.
On top of that, I've re-developed sciatica on both sides...in my glutes...the sciatic knots.  This is very painful and radiates into my fused back.  So I've got pain in the back, butt and quads but have to work four days a week on my feet (including Black Friday this coming week...five days in a row).  Good thing...the knee is PERFECT!  Great ROM, zero pain.  It's everything else that has gone to hell.
Doc gave me some Tramadol that I take before work...helps a little bit. Will NOT go back to opioids. Need to go back to my chiroprator next week to see if she can straighten out my hips again to relieve the sciatica.
Lesson: You're not done until you're done.  Period.  I thought I could skip the end of the rehab and jump to the head of the employment line.  It doesn't work like that...and I should have known it.  Haven't joined a new band because I know that I can't haul all my bass equipment and do a 4+ hour gig without significant pain.  But I thought I could handle work.  Wrong.
A TKR is a very humbling experience.  If you think you can breeze right through this and ignore the brutal reality of it all, you're just as delusional as I've been these past few weeks.  You can convince yourself that you're done when you're really not.  Talked to my doctor cousin who ripped up a major leg tendon and was in a cast for 6 weeks.  Quads atrophied just like ours do.  Told me it will take a year to get them back...and I didn't listen. I thought his prediction did not apply to me...thought I was beyond it.  I'm not.  This is going to take the full year...period.
Take heart, my fellow TKRians...we will all be a lot better down the road but there are no shortcuts.  No excuses...do the work.  Me too...

"And i dont mean the physio exercises i was given after surgery! Of course it is imperitive you do these religiously as instructed by your physiotherapist. I am 11 months post lkr and have been struggling massively with the muscles in my leg! They keep tightening and stiffening which can be painful and definately hinders me walking. I joined a swimming pool and have been doing aqua aerobics. As well as swimming. I love it and it is so helping my knee and muscles in leg. I didnt go for 2 wks over xmas due to work and xmas and gosh what a difference. I just basically want to share this as it has helped me! I have learned so much from this site and people who have had the same replacement surgery as me i want to share my experience to! I swim 30 lengths twice a wk and do aqua fit once a week i wish i could do more but i cant due to work.
I did find it really hard to get my head round how differently everyone heals. It upset me when i was struggling to walk with a stick and some people were doing much better much sooner after surgery than me. However much you are told we are all different when you are working hard at physio and doing your best its a hard pill to swallow. They told me it could take 1 to 2 years to own your knee and i am now believing them. I have come such a long way and am still improving. Hopefully now swimming is helping so much i actually believe i wil get there! Any other tips and advice greatly recieved!

"I'm a 25 year old female. 6 months ago my left knee randomly swelled up. I tried the normal rest, elevation, ice, ibuprofen and it wasn't getting better it was just getting bigger. I saw an urgent care doctor (didn't have insurance at the time) and was given a steroid shot. The swelling went down significantly, about half the size but never went away. 3 months later when I got insurance and my knee started getting bigger again I went to my primary. I had labs done. ESR and CRP and Rheumatoid Factor. All came back normal. I had a sonogram done on my knee. Didn't reveal anything. Had an xray done. Didn't reveal anything. She gave me another steroid shot. Didn't work. She also tried to drain it twice but no fluid is in it. Another month later I noticed the size of my knee started changing daily. I finally got small relief to where it was hardly swollen and then in a day or two it would swell up to a grapefruit. I saw a rheumatologist last month and is very confused. Got more labs done. All seem normal. My biliruben is off just slightly. She gave me a steroid shot directly into my knee. Didn't work. Also tried to drain it but again there's no actual fluid in it. I have no idea why my knee is swollen.

I returned to work, on a phased return, yesterday, after 11 weeks off. I am semi retired so phasing me back in is easier.
It was good to get back with my friends there.
There is a but... I was absolutely exhausted by the time I went home & my knee was really painful. It was & still is very swollen. I am about to ice again. I am a receptionist in a (mainly) NHS dental practice & am on my feet a lot, with climbing onto a step stool (using unoperated leg) to get records out of a tall filing cabinet & leaning over the desk to take payment.
However it feels good to be back 'in the world' again.
I am still having physio, my bend still needs work, but am getting there. Still on the co codamol 2 or if needed 3 times a day.
There is light at the end of the tunnel!

I have gained 120 bend and almost completely straight.  However, the swelling is still HORRIBLE, and hurts. I saw my surgeon yesterday.  He said I may still be bleeding from the lateral release and took me off all anti-inflammitory drugs and Advil, told me to strictly take my Percoset 7.5mg.  Okay I'm scared to death of being addicted to these things, and I've tried getting off them and the pain will not let me.  I thought something might have gone wrong but he assures me it's okay, it's just a time issue.  I called another surgeon yesterday and they won't see me until, minimum, 6 months post surgery.  So am I being overly worried here or am I is this Dr a quack and I need to seriously see another doctor NOW....please any advice would be helpful

"So it is now six months since my TKR. Some of you might even remember me! I have learned a lot on here and had a lot of help. But the biggest thing I learned is to remember we are all different. Ironically the stomach pains that put me in hospital two weeks after the op weren't caused by the pain killers as (badly) diagnosed but by gallstones. I returned to hospital in October with the most unimaginable pain possible. I thought I was going to die with the gall stone blocking my bile duct. The pain made a knee replacement like a breeze in comparison - so it's not always worse than a kidney stone or maybe gallstones are worse! So that got removed and I lost over a stone in 10 days after zero food. All sorted now except I have to have my gall bladder out in the next few weeks. BUT - my knee is great. The two weeks with no physio and no exercises at three months worked wonders. It must have needed a rest! When I came out it was much straighter - maybe laying on my back for 10 days, about 2 deg, virtually normal. Unfortunately it still only bends to 90 deg, same as before the op and I doubt it will improve. Since I came out I have just exercised a bit and relied on walking and natural exercise - I did a lot in the first three months though. But hey, it's brillaint walking and pain free and even standing for long periods is good. Have also played nine holes of golf, walking with no problems at all. Can't wait to get the other one done as it hasn't been that painful for me. Just thought I would post something positive to help those who may be fearful of the op and may read less positive posts.
Good luck to everyone, especially those who are having difficulties.
Happy New Year!

"i haven't posted on here since my left TKR over 2 years ago! I am now having trouble with my right knee. I'm pretty sure there's arthritis there but the pain I am getting is different from what I used to get in my left knee pre op. I've started to get a sharp pain about 2/3cm below the knee on the inside. It does not hurt when I'm at rest but is very painful when I put weight on it. I saw my GP yesterday who sent me for an X Ray & told me to take painkillers! I have to wait 7 to 10 days for the results.
i just wondered if anyone else has experienced anything similar. I fell on this knee about 3 months ago and took a while to improve but this sharp pain has only started in the last week or so. My knee is a bit swollen but, it is not as stiff as it was after the fall and not as stiff as my right one used to get pre op. 
Does anyone else get this type of pain only when weight bearing?

"In September I had my first knee done. About 2-3 weeks later I got sciatica very badly. It radiated from my Bach to my hip and then down the back of my leg. My surgeon prescribed gabepentin and with stretching, exercising and moving my hips around right in bed it was relieved.
My second knee replacement was 8 weeks later. The nerve pain with it has been terrible. It is from the inside of the knee all the way down to my ankle. Pins and needles, burning like my skin was scaled and very sensitive to touch. Again I went on Gabepentin 300mg twice a day. 2 1/2 months later it is still the same. During the day I wear leggings as a soft slight compression. I use my massager when with the help of medication that part of the knee can bear it. I had no idea this could be a side effect and wonder how long it could last?

I had no idea how much was going to be involved in getting the knee moving again and I wish you were told a little bit more to prepare you beforehand.  Sitting is still the most difficult thing for me depending on he chair height.  I don't have great bend on the leg yet.  I cannot lift my leg behind me very much at all. Is anyone else in the same boat?  I stopped taking codeine and now just take Paracetemol as I need it.  Not too much swelling but I will be glad to get rid of the pressure socks next week.  I have started hydrotherapy my second session is today and hope that will help.  Some days I don't feel too bad but then I get a really low day where I feel exhausted and a bit tearful (today being one of them). I guess I'm just worried that I will never bend it properly.

What do I need to do to get rid of this final pain? Will massage from a physiotharapist help?

"Hi, I've been weightlifing for a while but only started on legs properly a few weeks ago... As far as I can remember I've had it for a while.
I get a popping or buckling movement on the left ""bone"" under my knee...
The best way I can describe the problem is if you sit and extend your left knee out about 45 degrees to the horizontal and tense your quads/hamstring - That bone or whatever on the left side that comes out is what moves / Buckles when I squat more than parallel to the ground... Can this be fixed? 
Cheers.

"I am also 10 weeks post TKR and still have stiffness in thigh, knee, calf areas and a little pain. Today I am trying to come off Tramadol and feel miserable: sweats, loose stools, a little shaky. I still take a muscle relaxant (Robaxin 500mg) every 6 hrs which helps with the tightness (stiffness) and Celebrex at night. I have 2 more days of PT left. I might have to take 1 Tramadol 50mg to get thru PT. Any suggesstions would also be helpful to withdraw from Tramadol!!!

"Hi
Just to see if anyone has any thoughts. Playing football 5 weeks ago and with no one near me I went to push away and felt a rip in right knee and excruciating pain. Think I twisted. No broken bones per x ray. Ended up with bad swelling all around knee. Also went yellow and blue from knee all the way down shin. If I could post pictures I would. Eventually after 5 weeks I have much less pain. I can weight bear, but get bad pain when I bend and weight bear. Also a bit of creaking noise. Pain mostly on the inner side of knee. I'm hopeful now it's mending itself but is there the possibility I have been left with an underlying problem that could recur? I have specialist on Wednesday. Cheers, James. PS can post photos here?

is there a difference between voltarol gel and voltaren gel.
i have a hunch they are possibly the same thing but one is for American market the other. U.K. 
Voltarol gel is what I get from the chemist in Britain even when I ask for voltaren. 
Oh no says the pharmacist you've got it wrong,this is what you are after.
Are they the same thing?

"In late December of 2015 I began having lower back pain around the sacrum on the left side. Doctors thought it was a ""sacral stress fracture,"" but they then ruled that out. It persisted for around 2 months, then seemed to go away. Then, I began having lateral hip pain on the same side. It, like the lower back pain, lasted a while then went away. More recently, within the last five months, just probably a month after the hip pain went away, I began having pain around the IT band. They ruled out IT band syndrome. From around the time that pain started, I've began having additional pain in my hamstring area, upper thigh area (in the back of my thigh right below the buttocks,) and even pain going from the IT band down into my upper calf on the left outermost side. Doctors have ruled out a torn meniscus. So now I'm left with no answers, and daily pain that not even Vicodin can help. Does anyone have any possible ideas? The pain is lessened when I lay flat on my right side, and seems to increase when sitting a little bit.

"I'm not happy about having to have another knee surgery but the doctor claims that it should work out. My only concern is the stiffness. I was very stiff before the first surgery and I having been dealing with stiffness after surgery. I was wondering if I will still have to deal with stiffness after my upcoming revision surgery? I can tolerate the pain but it's the stiffness that gives me the blues. I probably have 106 rom on a good day, but I have around 90 regularly. I'm praying that the VA get it right this time.

"I had a right TKR 10 weeks .  I think I am doing OK, but today have sharp nerve type pain in my knee.  I am assuming it is the nerves regenerating? I have no swelling heat or redness and I feel Ok.  Does anyone else have a similar experience.  Apart from that  I can walk 5 - 6 kl at a normal pace and have been back at work for 4 weeks.  I travel frequently for work and apart from some tightness if I  am stuck in traffic have no problems.  I sleep through at night now.  I do have some tightness if I stay in one position for too long especially if I am standing.   I take nurofen occasionally but usually stretching exercises or the exercise bike relieve the discomfort.  Any ideas?

if any of you are thinking of purchasing one then let me say that they dont do anything which any other kind of cold compress will not do.
so there is nothing magical
HOWEVER .......it is extremely easy to use and very very handy to have right there when required.  for example through the night. when everyone is sleeping . . . . . apart from you.

"Hi I am reaching the 4 week mark, and I am still having problems. The major problem seams to be when I bend my knee it feels like it is catching and then locks for a second. This really hurts when I am doing steps, but it happens when I am doing heel slids or any other bending.
I was just wondering if anyone else has or had this problem. My surgeon said to keep eye on it, and it sounds like hamstring tendinitis?? So we are doing exercises to strengthen the hamstrings but I have not felt any relief.
Thanks again for any and all input

"Hello all,
I found this forum in my darkest hours last November after having a left tkr. It was a tremendous help and let me realize I wasn't the only one having difficult times. I had my tkr on November 3, 2015 and was back at work on January 26th, 2016. I drive a truck over the road hauling milk. I had my good and bad days, mostly bad but this forum helped. I broke my leg in May of this year and now suffer nerve damage from that. My left knee has been horrible ever since and I've been to numerous doctors. Since having the tkr I relocated to Florida thinking that maybe being out of the cold would help but it hasn't. I now need the right knee done and to redo the left I've been put off work a couple times but that really doesn't bother me as I went back to work too soon anyways. I'm always on this forum looking for help and suggestions to make my legs feel better and my outlook on life so thank you to everyone sharing your experiences. I learned a lot and am still learning. I will finally have insurance again in January so will be taking care of both
knees again..

"I have pitting edema below knee on surgery leg with pain. Pain't is bad, but mostly from just below knee to ankle area. Called my surgeon's office, they said no way related to TKR and they would be out of office until 1st of year. I already have a regular appt scheduled with him for the 5th. My home PT is concerned, she has also called them. She doesn't think it is a blood clot due to no fever or redness but is concerned it could be a small vertical fracture where the prothesis is incerted into my tibula. This is a work comp case that has been ongoing close to 10yrs. My gp doesn't deal with any work comp cases and I would have to pay up front for visit as well as xrays...I can't afford it. My question is has anyone else experienced this or have any advice as to what could be causing this? Just swelling wouldn't concern me as much if it wasn't pitting. My ROM is good, 100 and -5.

But about a month ago (after the 6 month checkup with the surgeon) the knee has started hurting now and again. Now it really hurts at times and i dare not put weight on. I have been on anti inflammatory tabs for my back but when i cut them down the knee re hurts. I'm really worried, yet a month ago the x ray was fine and the surgeon pleased. I have no fever the knee is not swollen and is no warmer than usual. Could this be normal. is it because i'm using it more now i'm doing all my housework. Anyone any ideas? Otherwise i suppose i will have to see the surgeon again and that will take ages.........Thanks for any input on this

"Hi all ,im new here but can sure see why its so helpful to suffer together.
i have a couple of questions if i may.
i have had tkr on both knees this year. June 9th and November 2nd.
think this is too close together but wouldnt it be nice to have hindsight beforehand.
1st question.with a pillow between the knees and sleeping in the foetal position for about an hour,nice and relaxed. On awakening as soon as movement is attempted very painful and very stiff. Aftera great deal of moaning ,(male after all) i manage to get off bed and into a standing position where things gradually improve.
Any ideas whats going on here,o fellow sufferers?
question 2    between golf,tennis and cycling i was lucky enough to build up some decent leg muscles. Would i be right in thinking that because i have suffered more damage as a result of having more muscle to damage i am going to take longer to heal and maybe more painful getting there?
i will quickly slip in a third question:     if the pain up from the knee (as far as the groin) and down from the knee ( to the toes) is referred pain does this mean we can simply ice the knee area and expect the results of the  icing to be referred also.?
hoping that my questions are understood and this is all in order.
look forward to a few replies.
thanks amigos,

"Hello! This is my first posting, although I've been using this site as a resource for a few weeks. I am 43 and just had a left THR in order to prepare for a future right TKR (congenital structural abnormalities are driving these procedures - my knee has dislocated since I was 7).
Here's the scoop - I'm looking for any feedback!
- It seems like my recovery is slow - I'm still using 2 crutches, primarily outside (it is winter, and my right knee dislocates, so while I'm cautious I also need them). I walk without them inside the house but my limp is so bad that I can't walk with good posture, strong core.
- I have been having lower back muscle spasms (right side, opposition of surgical side) the past 2 days, leaving me immobile and in more pain than I can describe. Is this all related? When do I determine this is not normal and go in l? I'm using my post-op pain meds, Dilaudid, which I had been off for 3 weeks (the weaning period caused horrendous side effects).
- I went back to work 2 weeks post-op and I've been struggling to focus or stay engaged ever since. Has that happened to others? I feel like I can be productive for 3 hours max and then I'm disinterested, can't focus or exhausted (since I run my department and its end of year craziness, this is kind of bad!).
I would love any input!

"Recovering from a patella fracture 12 weeks ago. Been doing isometric quad exercises and ROM exercises for the past 6 weeks and It has improved a lot, ROM almost normal, but there is still some pain and instability.  I’ve been walking a lot (6000-12,000 steps per day), but with a slight limp and I can only take stairs slowly. 
3 different doctors analysed my mid-October MRI.  2 doctors and the original radiologist said there was no ACL damage and the 3rd doctor said the ACL is completely severed. Is it normal for two orthopaedic surgeons examining the same MRI to come up with opposite conclusions about an ACL tear? 
Maybe I damaged my ACL after the MRI while doing ROM exercises so it didn’t show on the MRI? I did feel some sharp pain after going for too much ROM a few weeks ago.
Anyway, should my quadriceps be stronger after 6 weeks of physio? I feel like I can’t build any muscle doing only isometric exercises, but because of the fractured patella, I can’t do any quad extensions yet.

"Okay 2-3 years ago I was on a skateboard and hit a sidewalk block that was slightly raise I fell and my right leg bent further than it was supposed to and to the outer side
I was told I only strained my minuscule and they gave me the usual crutches I was fine I picked back up and was back to normal from that injury I played water polo in the fall last year and swam in the spring this year and did some more waterpolo this fall and had no issues
2-3 months ago I was out paint balling with a friend I was sprinting to cover so I wouldn't get shot and jumped down a 3-4 foot drop my right knee popped (so same leg) a couple times like 4-5 times on impact I couldn't walk for a bit but I forced it after the round so I wouldn't get my knee locked for the most part I could sort of walk
My coach wasn't happy but accepted it said I should see our athletic trainer and my doctor to see how serious it was after all I was still sorta able to walk
He told me I tested positive for acl and Mcl injury after pulling my leg and the pulling outward a little and said I should see my doctor and get an MRI just incase because he didn't like that my knee was heating up
He iced my knee personally till the end of the week so that Friday was 5 days already I went to the ER and they only erayed me said my miniscus is fine but they can't see ligaments or something my memory is not to good there they gave me another set of crutches and a cast said if the pain continues in a week I follow up with my doctor so he can refer me to a specialist for an MRI
My walking improved in that week a lot but I still limped a little I still ended up following up with my doctor really old guy and he refered me to a place I went the first time from the skateboard incident, i was 17, I went that Tuesday and the said they don't see people above 17 i left thinking what ever I'm getting better quick I should be fine in a month I went back to the gym and just last month I was running okay but didn't feel comfortable sprinting I was squatting and doing leg presses but I never touched the water
3 weeks pass and I take a 1000m swim under 18 minutes to qualify for a lifeguard position for the county around lap 13/40 I kick of the wall to finish a lap and the only time I use a little assistance with my right leg my knee pops 1 big time but I continued swimming with pain I barely make the cut and can not walk without pain after but I force it because I had paper work to do after my knee buckled 3 times and hurt each time
We finish my friend drives me home and I continue my next few days hopping on one leg around the house
My knee swelled and got really hot so I iced here and there and I couldn't straighten my leg I told my self give it 5 days that's how long it took the last time on top of that my calf has been really cold Compared to my other calf and tends to stay cold no matter how much I cover it unless I warm it up with hands or a heater
I heading into day 8 now I'm no longer hoping just on one leg I can sort of use my right leg but I can't straight walk and my front part of the knee hurts when I take a step and it does feel loose
Except when I do nothing I don't feel pain I can drive perfectly fine I can't sort of slouch walk up stairs as I don't straight that leg out but I just can't walk well
It is also still slightly swollen I can sort of straighten it out when I lay flat in bed on my stomach but i feel tension in my knee
My calf is still cold as compared to my other calf and the knee is still warm
And yes I can move my ankle in full rotation with ease
Thoughts on what it can be did I tear something or did my knee just lock
Should I keep elevating and icing should I continue trying to straight my leg out from time to time
Will it get better on its own
Or do I definitely need surgery asap for it
1st incident I could walk a little and it only got better quickly 1 month and I was running and walking normal
2nd incident I couldn't walk at first but I could sort of force it with pain and then didn't want to straighten fully the next day

A young man (8 or 9 yr old) a son of a UK police officer is coming to my area and the hospital I go to for a very unique brain surgery. This is a procedure that isn't done in the UK and the university of Kansas medical center is one of the few globally. The local sheriff and the police chief in the UK became acquaintances several years ago. A phone call do the local guy set this in motion. The locals will meet the family at the airport and transport them to a Ronald McDonald house close to the hospital and transport them as needed for appointments.

And the total knee replacement.... oi. it is like pulling teeth getting any physician to agree that I need to have my knees done, despite my ""young"" age. Now my knee has begun locking. And let me say, when it does, its stuck ant its the worst excruciating pain I have ever experienced. Frightening! When I get in this position, would I be able to just extend the leg real fast for relief? I just dont know what the consequences would be, or how bad it would feel.

My knee seems to be healing well--I don't use a crutch most of the time and can already walk pretty well, including up stairs (down is still one at a time).
I have been takng one oxycontine and one Aleve before I go to bed right along. Last week I found  myslef waking up after two hours and having to take another oxy, and now I wake up and even the second oxy doesn\t stop the pain enough for me to go back to sleep. I wonder if I am developing a tolerance to it.
My  PT encourages me to walk, do the exercises and ride a statioanry bike as much as possible but I am wondering if I am overdoing it.
The funny thing is that I can fall asleep with no problem during the day. These unscheduled naps last for 30 to 60 minutes and I always wake up feeling if I had slept much longer.      
I am planning on going back to my job teaching high school in three weeks and hope to resolve this sleep issue. Anu suggestions.

2 weeks ago, I slipped on a wet surface in a car park and fell heavily onto my knee. Within 5 minutes it was very swollen and sore, couldn't bend/straighten leg properly. As I had fallen outside a supermarket I was able to get some ice to apply quite soon afterwards. 
It was very painful, and caused me to be in tears trying to drive home. Within a week it was much easier to walk on and the swelling and bruising had pretty much gone. 
However, I am worried because the skin around the area feels odd- a bit like being numb/altered sensation to touch. It is sore if I press the area, and if I try to kneel on it it feels like being stabbed! Also, it feels like there is something moving small moving about if I rub it with my hand. 
Having said that, I can walk on it without much of a problem. 
Wondering if it is just badly bruised and will settle down, or if I have done something more serious? Any thoughts? Is it worth a trip to the GP, or am I likely to get a 'rest and it'll settle' response?
Anyone experienced anything similar who can offer advice? 
TIA

"Hi, lately my left knee has been bothering me for a while now. But I have no idea what it could be. It cracks randomly and it pops randomly that causes sharp pain. Even sitting in a chair causes me discomfort. And now that it's winter, it hurts to even be outside in the cold.
P. S. I sprained my ankle a few years ago and didn't heal properly, just so my history is clear

Knee very stiff, bend really hard, maybe only 80deg at mo. Straight flat no problem.
When walking it feels solid (like locked ) after 5mins, it just swells. I walk like I have a false leg at the mo.
My surgeon stretched my hamstring and muscles which slowed me down, but that's getting easier.
Sure my other knee ALL was a bit easier.
Sitting very uncomfortable!

"From day one I have had lateral knee pain that is now still with me 14 weeks after surgery. The pain occurs and stops my flexion at 125 degrees. It makes it difficult to walk down hills or bear weight on the knee when it is in a flexed position. Thus rising out of a chair is painful or standing on the leg and going down to the next step on stairs. I have numbness on the upper lateral aspect of my leg making me think of a nerve entrapment but I have NO weakness. Bending and straighting my leg in bed causes the pain and sitting with the knee flexed for long periods causes the knee to start aching. Has anyone else experienced this situation?

"Hi all,
I had my surgery six weeks ago and am now struggling a little bit practically every day. I just want to turn that corner and be feeling a lot more positive. I've been reading some of the other posts on here and have seen that these sort of issues are quite normal.
I suppose what I'm after is just a bit of reassurance that it will all be ok to give me a bit of confidence. I've been to PT and they are more than happy with how it's going but I just feel as if I want everything to be back to normal ASAP as I'm starting to climb the walls.
Sleeping is becoming the biggest issue I suppose I'm not falling asleep until about 2am then this is having a knock on affect during the day. It mainly the uncomfortable ness I'm taking a strong pain killer of a night time but even then I'm waking every hour or two the broken sleep is a nightmare.
I'm looking at some advice really on how long I can expect these dort of issues carrying on for.
Thank you Kevin

"11 weeks ago had a nondisplaced vertical patella fracture and level II MCL damage.
* Doctor said no surgery was not needed.
* Wore a plaster splint (weeks 1-3), then a hard cast (weeks 3-4), followed by    a knee brace locked at 90 degrees(weeks 5-8).
* Took the brace off at week 9.
My recovery has been mixed. Now I'm still feeling lots of tension and some pain and swelling. Feel like the knee is not stable. Would it be a good idea to put the knee brace back on? I feel like I need to try walking naturally without the brace at week 11. Maybe I've been walking too much (6000 to 10000 steps per day, taking one flight of stairs only when necessary).
Also, would an open patella slip on sleeve brace be beneficial?
Want to start building up my quads too, but worried that quad extensions might exacerbate the problem. The isometric straight leg exercises with ankle weights help some, but I'm not really gaining any muscle or strength doing them.
Or, maybe my recovery is normal after 11 weeks but I'm just expecting too much?

"Hi! I'm 21 and few months ago from changed my lifestyle started work which required a lot of walking and stairs plus I started exercising squats with weights etc. Around 1,5month later suddenly I've started having pain in my knees which I neglected and soon after that I was unable to walk it hurt so much. Doctor diagnosed it with overused cartilages and gave me hialuron acid injections, I've been on.sick leave for like 2 months which included one month of walking with curtches. Then I did mri which showed my cartilages are fine but I have excess body of Hoffa and plica in both my knees. Right now I'm able to walk and work again but I can't crouch or squat cuz it hurts me, I can't bend my knees too much and generally I can't do many things. And what worries me the most is that every day when I rest after work, sit down or lie on the sofa for 2-3h my knees get stiff and inflammed , they get whole red and burning and hurt me. Plus often they kinda lock when I sit, I feel it when I stand up, cuz then they pop and its really uncomfortable, i feel it on bike as well (though riding bike in general is not comfortable for me anymore). I'm young and it happened so suddenly so I'm.freaking worried, I'm living abroad so I can't really cure it unless I.go back to my country either. What do you think causes this inflammation? I'm so sick of living such life, I can't do basic things anymore! And doctors give me mixed diagnosis :<

"Hi all,
Have a look at the thread below for context:
https://patient.info/forums/discuss/on-going-issues-537151
I have been lucky to have been relatively stable for a little more than 3 months now, which is great. It was my ankles bothering me mostly over the summer, and everything has been pretty comfortable for a little, knock on wood.
However, the knee does still have almost constant puffiness that comes and goes seemingly without reason. 
I am wondering if it could be meniscus? When I've had issues in the past, an experienced chiro said that's what was clinically presenting, but an MRI did not find anything. 
Another thing to note is that the coming & going of puffiness is very random.
As an example, a few weeks ago I had to do about 4-6 hours of walking a day for about 3 days in a row, including a not insignicant hike. And the knee was fine.
Then on Friday, at the end of the workday I started feeling extreme tightness in the top of the quad & bottom on the hamstring, and over the weekend the knee puffed up quite a bit. I cannot think of anything I could have done to trigger that.
I am planning to see a specialist on the 14th so hopefully can get some more ideas then.
Any thoughts?

"Hey I'm still not too happy about my revision surgery next month. The ligaments in my knee were really loose before the original TKR in July 2016 and the doctor thought he repaired them enough to tighten back up but that didn't happen. It caused the plastic piece to loosen as well, causing me unbearable pain. January 31, 2017, he's going to go back in and retighten my ligaments and insert a thicker piece of plastic. I'm praying that this eliminates my pain. Has anyone experienced ligament issues with their TKR? I opted for the surgery instead of wearing a brace for the rest of my life.

"Hello all,
I have been struggling with knee pain for close to 5 months. I'm a 26 male at 78 kgs, who has been regularly going to the gym (2-3 times a week) since I was 18. I don't play any sports and I have an office job that requires me to sit at a desk all day.
The pain first began after performing deep squats on the smith's machine at the gym. I had rather heavy weights on my back (100KG) and felt a pinch at the top of my patella on both knees halfway through my set of 10 reps. The pain was quite minimal but over the next few weeks I could feel a pinching sensation when jumping or going down stairs. I listened to my friends advice and ceased to do any weights on my lower body for one month.
ONE MONTH AFTER INJURY:
The weaker my legs got the worse the pain seemed to get. My knees begin swelling a little bit after walking a few kilometres and going up and down stairs. They also began noticeably clicking and when squatting to 90 degrees I could feel what I can only describe a tendon burning pain. I decided it was time to see a physio.
After the first consultation he began to think it could be tendinitis in the knee or possibly a small quad tear in the lower part of my VMO. Over the space of the next six weeks he performed an ultrasound, massages, acupuncture and light leg press exercises. We even trying taping the knee for support, along with using the foam roller to stretch out my quads. My knee continued to swell and felt weak when squatting halfway down. At this point I began to feel a little hopeless and decided it was time to book in for an MRI.
TWO MONTHS AFTER INJURY:
I got back my MRI results on my left knee and they concluded I had sprained my ACL. They found a little bit of fluid around the joint as well as around the top of my patella. Everything else appeared normal. I was pretty positive that it would heal itself over the next few weeks and I could exercise without any restraint.
THREE MONTHS AFTER INJURY:
My knee continued to swell after walking, jumping, exercising. I decided to go to a different doctor for a second opinion. They booked me in for a cortisone injection in my left knee. During the ultrasound, prior to inserting the needle, they mentioned they couldn't find much swelling around the patella (Which I thought was a little strange because it was throbbing and burning). They managed to find a little pocket on the top left of my patella and said the injection was a success.
Mentally I thought my left knee was getting better over the next couple of days, however this was far from the case. I once again began to experience a light tingling and mild burning from my knee to my ankle after exercising on both legs.
FOUR MONTHS AFTER INJURY:
At this point I was very frustrated and determined to get to the bottom of my knee pain. I decided it was time to see an orthopaedic surgeon to see if I could get the knee scoped out. The surgeon had a look at the MRI results and believe it was Patellofemoral pain syndrome. He said this could be because I have a shallow knee groove and this could be fixed via physical therapy. I insisted this was not the case and asked for a second MRI on my other (right) damaged knee to make sure the first MRI didn't miss anything (cartilage damage / cyst). He agreed and booked me in for a scan which I have booked in for three weeks time.
FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS AFTER THE INJURY
Recently I've began to slowly exercise my lower body at the gym with very light weights and stretches. I feel my strength in my knees and VMO are improving however I am still getting an uncomfortable tingling and burning pain in both knees when sitting or lying down. My knee also noticeably clicks on the outside of both knees when riding the bike or bending the knees past 50 degrees.
I’m due to go in for my second MRI this week but I was wondering if anyone else had / has similar symptoms and could offer some sort of advice.
After extensive research I’ve come to believe the tingling / burning / pinching means I may have damaged the nerves in my knee after heavy squatting. Could this be the cause of all the pain or is the specialists on the money regarding Patellar Maltracking / Patellofemoral pain syndrome ?
Any ideas? Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.
Will let you all know how my second MRI results go.

c). Still painful especially when trying to bend or going up and down the stairs, riding my bike, etc. ROM is around 110
d). Still walking with a limp. Feel pain in my left hip and butt cheek as well. I can feel pain shoot from my hip doen to my knee.

"Left TKA 15 weeks post -op. I still have a lot of pain when walking but try and walk everyday regardless.  When my home Pt had me do a leg lift ( 5 days post -op) I heard a small pop followed by excruciating pain. The PT said it was probably scar tissue and to avoid leg lifts for a couple of days. Anyway, that area on the inside of my knee cap has always bothered me especially when doing
heel slides. I think I created bursitis because of the friction the
slides caused. Does anyone else have knee pain when walking ? And has anyone suffered from bursitis in the area slightly below the knee cap?

"Hello everyone, I am 4 1/2 weeks out from total knee revision due to loose ligaments which made the knee unstable . I am concerned about my forward progress being so slow. I am only at 105 bend. The knee is much tighter now and I'm concerned that I may not get good bend in it. I'm pushing for 120-125. That's what I had with the unstable knee. (I know I'm pushing for what may never happen. But I just don't know).
The pain is so much better now. I'm only taking pain pills when I go to therapy or when I am on it for longer periods. I am working hard at doing my stretches at home and of course at therapy. I am just curious if anyone else has had a revision because of those ligaments where they put a device with longer stem's and a straight rod in the middle that takes the place of the ligaments. It only bends forward and backwards not side to side. This makes the knee more stable. I am thankful for this site which helps me realize I am not alone. Thank you for your help. Nancy

"Hi
I just thought i'd give an update on my second TKR op.  I had my right TKR in December last year and 6 weeks ago i had my left TKR.  Less than a week after the op i had two infections, one was mild ecoli and the other was mixed anarobes.  I was lucky because although i had these infections i didn't feel unwell and two different antibiotics had it sorted in about a week and half.  I'm sleeping really well and i think that because i've already had one knee done i was much more prepared for the shock of the second, and let's be fair it really is a shock to the system.  Anyway my bend is just over a hundred and i'm at the stage where i feel like i have a tight rubber band around my knee, which i can still remember from my first op,  Also the stiffness has already kicked in big time.  All this will pass much further down the line so for now it's down to grin and bear it.  i feel some people suffer so much when they have this op and i'm always very grateful that so far i've got off lightly.

"10 weeks ago: 48 yo male: Motorcycle accident causing the following injury:
* Vertical non-displaced patella fracture 
* Grade II injury at quadriceps tendon.
* Possible small vertical tear at medial meniscus
* Mild grade 1 injury of MCL ligament
Unfortunately, injury was misdiagnosed and mistreated for the for the first few weeks (I'm an expat living in Asia) and I started with just a half leg splint instead of a full cast. 
Treatment:
* Knee Splint: first 3 1/2 weeks
* Crutches: 6 weeks (alternating between 1 and 2 crutches: Should've been    using 2 always for 6 weeks)
* Fibreglass cast (on at week 3.5, off at weeks 5: should've been put on at      day 1)
* Knee brace: Locked at 90 degrees: Weeks 5-Week 10
Progress
* I can walk okay at 10 weeks but still can’t take stairs without pain.
* Doing PT for ROM and isometric exercises. (A physiotherapist actually had    me doing leg extensions with weights at 4 1/2 weeks, which is way to soon    to be doing bent-leg weight bearing exercises so I stopped going. Doing PT    on my own)
* Still some pain and swelling
* Still wearing brace for stability and to prevent hyperextension (Doc says I      don't need it anymore, but I feel safer with it)
Conerns
I’m concerned that not having a proper cast for the first 6 weeks and only using 1 crutch at times could’ve caused damage such as an excess of internal scar tissue (adhesions) which could lead to arthristis.
Does it sound like I’m being paranoid?

"I wanted to bring some positive vibes into the Forum.  We all go through so much with our recoveries, but there is always a light at the end hopefully.  I am 4 weeks into my TKR recovery.  Last Friday, my physio discharged me and said just get on with what you're doing because it's definitely working.  That was doing all my exercises and walks every day.  She suggested I buy an exercise bike, which I've seen many of you have and to replace my exercises with that.  So no, I'm doing 5 minutes x 5 times a day and that is really working well.  I'm currently at a bend of 115.  I was having a lot of trouble sleeping at night and with the help of many of you, I've swapped my painkillers for sleeping tablets and that's working so well for me.  This morning, for the first time, I was able to walk up the stairs one after the other, rather than one step at a time.
?I just wanted to give everyone out there hope for their recovery.  It can go perfectly well.  Yes, there are still low times when I feel my knee is an alien being, and yes, it's still stiff and tight most of the time.  But I try and concentrate on the positives.
?Everyone on here is so helpful in their recommendations and I've used the forum many times in my 4 weeks, sometimes just reading what everyone else is going through helps get us through the day.  So, thanks to all of you, and good luck to everyone in their own journeys to recovery.

"I am now nearly 14 weeks Post Op from a bilateral knee replacement, I am 63, getting really depressed today I feel like sh*t, I am so sick of waking up all night with the pain ( I use the pillow between the legs and all that stuff) not only that I am in pain most of the day too, I dont like taking to much pain meds and the Doctor can only give a script for 20 tabs at a time, I take 2 at a time but only on the days when I'm really desperate. I feel as though I've made a huge mistake and would have been better of with the pain I had prior which wasnt any where near as bad as this. Everything else is fine have had xrays and the specialist is happy with my progress/healing, which is good but the pain is driving me crazy, I'm sure none of these Doctors have ever had this op

"Hello,
One year ago I tore my medial meniscus breakdancing and had arthroscopic surgery to remove some of the meniscus. My knee didn't heal properly and I can't fully extend my leg, which causes a lot of discomfort when i'm standing up straight. My knee also pops a lot. Sometimes it will pop and i'll loose even more extension ROM and it will pop again and it'll go back again. I've seen a physio and am doing exercises but the discomfort when standing hasn't improved. (I'm 23 and this is really ruining my ability to do things with my life).
Any ideas whats going on with my knee?
What should I do?

"Hello, I am three weeks post op from a trochleoplasty o my right knee. almost all of my swelling has gone and am walking with no pain. I cannot bend my knee at all. My surgeon said that I should have full use of my knee by this stage but not to worry until 6 weeks post op and hopefully i will be bending by then. Has anyone had problems bending their knee. What do they do if you cannot bend after you have recovered? thanks

"Had replacement 6 days ago and was expecting general pain for a while post surgery. However, what I'm experiencing when using crutches is excruciating. When standing up I get surface pain across my knee and down shin that feels like sandpaper is being rubbed and down, as though  the skin is being stretched. Years ago I had a large burn on the side of my leg that gave the same sensation when I stood up. Is it down to the bruising which is still coming out and how long will it continue? Only taking paracetamol or codeine in between anti infalamtories.

I told her I was disappointed with my progress. Her immediate response was 'Its only 7 weeks!'
My knee bend is almost 90 degrees which in itself a minor miracle because before the op I couldn't bend the knee at all!!!
I have to work on straightening my leg and refrain from twisting the knee.

"Hi all.,  Still in heaps of  pain  & looking at options. I went   for  my  2nd opinion  today from another  orthopaedic  surgeon.  I  think he gathered  pretty  quickly  that  I   do  not  wish  to  rush intom a   TKR unless it is  the  last option. He    has suggested a  Synvisc  one   injection   which  can last  for  many patinets   up to  6  months or even longer.  He  said  1/3  patience get  great results. 1/3   get  partial relief of  pain  &  1/3  get    almost no relief. It only  costs   about  $400  or less  out of  pocket  compared  to   $6000   for stem cell therapy  so  I think it  may be  worth a   try.  MY  1st  orthopaedic   surgeon  who  did my arthroscopy  has never mentioned this.  Has anyone has  this  done & did   it hel[ ?

This TKR has been a total nightmare! I'm almost five months post op, and this vic is telling me, that he has to perform another surgery. I want a refferal, but the VA won't give me one, because they have three witch doctors, excuse me professional orthopedic surgeons on staff. I wish I hadn't even gotten this TKR done.

"Good morning all,
I'm new here and I'm driven here by an agonisingly protected knee complaint. I'm a cyclist have have been for 10 years. I'm 25 and a teacher so advice I've had to stay seated constantly isn't particularly effective.
In March I was competing in an audax and 100 or so miles in I started to experience a dull ache in my right leg above my knee to the outside. I had no option but to cut short and cycle 70 miles home.
Over the next few weeks I abstained from cycling but the pain didn't subside. I went to see a Physio who diagnosed it as a pulled tensor fascae latae (excuse my spelling) so he manipulated it and prescribed a tens machine. After several weeks off and using the machine to no avail I visited another Physio who attributes it to weak glutes putting excess stress on other parts of my leg and prescribed a series of gluteus activation and strengthening exercises.
These seemed to work for a while and for a period I was able to get back cycling. I kept up my exercises but again the injury returned and now it's worse than ever. I'm currently into a stint of 12 weeks off, now with an NHS Physio who has given a similar diagnosis but the exercises don't seem to be doing anything. I wondered if anyone could offer any advice if they have had a similar injury. I'm still not wholly sure it is my itb and it could be my lat vat.
I have finally been given an MRI appointment (6 weeks time) because in my off time I was recommend to swim and now I have a suspected torn meniscus but I want to do all I can in the meanwhile because I'm getting incredibly fed up and down about not being able to do anything.
Any thoughts/opinions would be greatly received.

"I am 6 months post TKR on right knee. Things generally going well, though still some pain--especially when first standing up. But, there have been some days where my knees (especially the non-TKR knee) are so sore that it's nearly unbearable. I've read that the barometric pressure affects joints, but haven't ever experienced this before. Does anyone else feel that in their replaced knee? I guess I thought that having an artificial knee would protect me from that kind of vulnerability. Sigh.

"Had a non-displaced vertical patella fracture (with some level 2 ligament and meniscus damage) 9 weeks ago. No surgery, treated with a splint, then a cast, and now a kneebrace (unlocked after week 6). 
I've been doing a lot or ROM and AROM exercises, and straight-leg lifts with ankle weigts since week 6.  Also walking wthout crutches since week 5. My knee feels sore and tight, but I keep doing these exercises because I was told that it is normal. It feels more sore than at week 6, but I don't know if it's good soreness (from exercise) or bad soreness (from overdoing it).
Should I stop doing these activities until the soreness subsides or is it normal? I know pain comes with PT, but I can't determine between what is healthy soreness and what might be prolonging my recovery or further damaging my knee.

"Hi all - I would really like to know  IF any members here from Australia,USA ,UK or any where else have had this  done ? What was  your opinion & how successful did  you think it was ?  I know it is not covered under private health in Australia & may cost around at least $6000   BUT what is   a person's quality of life  worth  IF  you can   get the money together. ? It has been featured on ""Today Tonight""  here in Australia which is a major current affairs program.Apparently it has worked well  for  athletes & major league football players. I am at the stage  of thinking that IF  this has a chance of working that I will look into it further.  I may even need to travel interstate to have it done but I don't care as I am so desperate.IF I  can avoid a partial or  full knee replacement I will be happy as I am  in daily pain  & stressed to  the max  with living with  the loss of my lifestyle & constant pain..I can barely walk for 5 minutes without being in agony   & have been declared  medically unfit to drive. I have lost my independance & I want to get my life back.  I have had an arthroscopy  6 months ago  for a medial menicus tear which did pretty much  nothing for pain relief  & now my  recent MRI shows I am bone on bone with  no cartilage on my inner knee.
I really hope to hear from some members who may have had this procedure done & hear what  they think  & if it has been of benefit to them.I am truly looking forward to other members input  as I can not cope much longer with the loss of my lifestyle  & level of pain. Thanks Colleen

"I've had a back of the knee/calf problem for nearly a month now, and the pain has not gone away. I play soccer pretty competitively and noticed a pain in the back of my left knee after a practice. It would get worse the more I used my leg, whether that be walking, running, jumping, etc. I can't figure out 1, what exactly is wrong with my knee/calf, and 2, what to do to heal it. I've had several practices and games in the past month, most that I've had to sit out on, but on some occasions I don't feel any discomfort in normal everyday activities but as soon as I begin to exercise or practice the back of my knee with hurt. The only treatment I've tried is the PRICE method. Right now I think it might be gastronemius tendonopathy, mostly because I feel pain when walking down stairs, which leads me to believe it is calf related. Whatever thoughts you have on this would be appreciated, I just want to figure out what is wrong so I can get back out on the field, or at least be able to workout my legs.

"Advice please, pain on the outisde of my knee near to the top of the Fibula. 
Increased pain after being mobile. Tender and unable to lie on that side as pressure builds up inside. Small precise area however when the pain flares up after walking around etc I notice tingling in the outside toes. Pain is constant but with flare ups, no swelling, bruising. A little unstable if I try to pick the pace up on walking so don't try now. Snails pace it the best way to describe my walking. Unable to bend fully either. Strain/pull on the outside too much to bare. The lack of bending not just affects walking up stairs but also sitting upright in chairs etc
Been like this for over a year. Started suddenly after walking up the stairs, 5 months after having a succcessful arthroscopy for a torn Meniscus Cartilage. Had been pain free and totally mobile post op up until then. 
Have been fobbed off my hospital last seen in April. I am totally fed up being laid up. After 2 physio sessions I was discharged after failing to make any improvement, however the exercises given were like walking and bending. All the movements that were causing pain in the first place! 
Any suggestions on what it could be that I could research? Tried LCL sprains but syptoms don't fit. Then thinking of a form of inflamation like Tendonitis as pain increases after use, but it isn't near a tendon. Research has failed to shed any light. 
Totally confused. 
Thank you

"Hi, I've just joined this group in the hope that you can help.  My son injured his leg about two years ago.  He was moving a table when his knee gave out and shifted out of place.  He was taken to hospital and his leg was put in a brace. Over the next 6 months he was told to do exercises at home. It seemed to heel and he was able to carry on normal life.  Every now and again he would say it was aching so he would take it easy until it was feeling better. He's not particularly attactive i.e he doesn't play sports etc. So in general it has been hurting off and on especially if he has a particularly busy day.
Then this in February it popped out again and then shafted back again and again in the summer. He says that it does feel like it wants to pop out more and more now.  About two,weeks ago it popped out completely again but now feels weaker than ever. He had a full cast put in his leg to keep the knee in position which stay on for a week, and now he has a brace with two clips above the knee and two below.  He has an MRI tonight but I'm not sure what they can do next, it has been swollen for two weeks and feels AND looks like it has spongy water substance around the knee. He says that on a pain scale of 1 to 10 he is constantly at 4 and pecks around 7 at the end of the day and has every day this past two weeks.
can someone please share their stories or give advice please.

Sometimes just standing or sitting hurts
Another horrid symptom I feel under the skin a sudden huge movement of liquid like a waterfall or as if I've got weird sudden leaks under the skin in various parts of my leg,

"A few days after my total knee replacement surgery on June 20th this past summer (2016), I felt a pop or click inside my knee with each step I took. I didnt think much about it then. Two weeks after my surgery in my post-op check-up my surgeon it was ""intneral scar tissue"" causing the clicking/popping and over time the problem would go away.  I saw him last week, five months since my surgery. I told him I was still having this popping/clicking in my knee with each step i take. Now he says that it is the the metal clicking on the plastic and that it will go away once I get my leg muscles built up. The stronger mucscles will ""tighten up the parts"" and the discomfort and pain caused by the internal friction (and clicking/popping) will end.  
The bottom line is that I think the replacment parts are loose internally. I hope a re-do is not needed. 
Have any of you had this type of problem?

Has anyone else heard of stem cells therapy ?  I have heard it  has worked wonders for athletes & footy players . I may have to travel interstate  for this & private health may not cover this   BUT I am only in my 50's & feel like a 90 year old atm.  I am desperate  to get my life back &  fed up with feeling so stressed & anxious about all of this. I can not do  any more than 10 minutes of work at home,  I can't walk inside the shopping mall for longer than  5 minutes. I fell like my life is in ruins. Any input or advise will be appreciated,
Thanks Colleen

Had to undergo an aspiration to make sure that there was no infection in situ - good news was NO INFECTION!! Apparantly an Aseptic loosening generally has no explanation or particular cause....
Which still leaves me in the position of needing a revision replacement of the right knee. my original Surgeon (who has been out of the picture for a ;ittle while as he has had to have a hip replacement,  talk about physician heal thyself!!) doesnt feel that he is the right guy to do the revision, as he hasnt done many revisions and not for a while, so Ive been referred to a new surgeon. Im told that he has a particular interest in Revisions..... I get to meet him on December 6th, 2 years almost to the day since I was placed on the Surgical waiting list the first time round....
SO thats me. Ive not been around for a while as Ive not been in a particularly good place......Ive been finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the fact Ive got to have a 3rd surgery, and a more complex one at that.....its already taken 2 years out of my life, and Ive still got a good way to go yet......BUT Im getting there. Ive had some help from my GP (I dont know what Id have done without her to be honest) and I can now talk about whats happening without bursting into tears....

The leg is three times larger than the other one and the compression socks feel like they are cutting off my circulation on swolleen leg.  Wearing these a month, just trying to get by.  63 years old, had hip replaced, not bad, knee isnt going as smoothly, still other knee to go in three months.  What helps you guys stay upbeat?

Surely it would be different to an ordinary infection?
When I saw a consultant last week regarding my walking difficulties, he said that 2% of people who have knee replacement are not happy with them. This seems an awful lot considering the amount of people having this operation. I got the impression he was trying to fob me off!!

"Please can I have some advice again. I'm two weeks today post tkr. Onleaving hospital I was given paracetamols (500mg x 2) and dihydrocodeine and told take the paracetamol every 6 hrs and the dihydrocodeine 1 tab or 2 tablets if I need them to supplement. I'm now pretty much ok not to take the dihydrocodeine- sometimes still have to have 1 at bedtime. I'm also trying to not take the paracetamol at midday and 6pm. But I think that might be a step too far. I don't have a lot of pain in the day, mostly at night. But I don't seem to do as well in other ways if I don't take the paracetamol. My thinking is that if I don't take so much of it, it will work better when I do.
How did everyone else use their meds at this point? I'm feeling as if I shouldn't keep taking it as much.

"I had my tkr on my right knee last Wednesday and returned home on Saturday. I'm 57. Of course, like all, one day is fantastic and then you have a bad night, but I'm already pleased I had the operation. I have a couple of questions that I would like others to give me their experience on:
1. It feels as if my whole day and evening is taken up with exercises as my pt said I have to do them every hour and then a walk every two hours, followed by an ice pack. The booklet says 3-4 times a day, which seems more realistic. I've settled on 7-8 times a day. Each session is about 15 mins.
2. Painkillers- I'm taking 2 x 500mg paracetamol with the option of an additional 1 to 2 dihydrocodeine tablets. I've been needing 1 of those each time and sometimes the 2nd one too. Is that too much, should I try harder to reduce it?
Thanks for any help those of you beyond week 1 can give me. I still can't lift my right leg up off my bed without the help of my dressing gown cord and the PT seems to think I should. Although some of the exercises do bring tears when I'm more tired, I am persevering.

"Hi TKRers I had my op at the beginning of July 2016 on my left knee and although I was shocked by the pain after the op, I dutifully did all my Physio even though I am not a great lover of exercise, being 60 and overweight and lazy but I was determined to get a good result. At the end of my 8 week sessions my Physiotherapist said I had great bend and extention and I was free from all sticks or crutches so the docter signed me off to go back to my part time job, this was the end of September. I felt so pleased with myself and everyone said how well I looked as I had managed to loose about a stone as well. But, since I have been back to work I have found that my recovery seems to have gone backwards. I only work 3 days in an office but it is a busy one where i am up and down all day seeing clients and going out on visits. My walking is fine and I have come to terms with all the clicking and popping that goes on in my knee. But any incline or walking up steps or getting up and down from sitting is still very painful and it gets worse by the end of the day. I am still on paracetamol 4 times a day. Can anyone give me any advice as to what I can do? Will strengthening the muscle in my thigh help? What about getting an exercise bike? Or am I just being a whimp and it's something that will improve over time? Any advice gratefully received

I'm 6 months post tkr but my other knee is now giving me considerable pain. Last night was the first night it's kept me awake a lot of the night. I notice that a lot of people seem to have a tkr both knees eventually and just wondered how common this is? I wondered if my good knee is still compensating for all the years it's had to support my bad knee so it's playing up a bit. Has anyone else found that the ""good"" knee once a tkr is performed on the bad knee starts playing up? At this stage I couldn't even imaging going through a tkr ever again.

"Well, at exactly 12 weeks post-op, I had a manipulation done on my right TKR yesterday. I know everyone is different, but I wanted to share my experience here for anyone who wants to know more about it. The procedure was done at 7 am and I was awake by 7:45 am. I could move my knee way more immediately, even though my surgeon didn't tell my measurement, (I'll find out today in PT), we've all been watching our measurements for weeks and have a good idea of what numbers look like, right? I would say I easily gained at least 10-15 degrees, putting me probably at about 115-117 flexion. Side note: I didn't even get sick from the anesthesia! (I always do), probably has to do with the shorter time under. I can now sit with my leg bent comfortably at 90 degreed or more, can get up easily, it doesn't look like I'm getting on a horse when trying to get in the shower! First of all, my surgeon is amazing, and I trust him completely, I had complete faith in him and this procedure and expected an excellent outcome. I have probably 5-6 more physical therapy visits (only because she is donating her time to me as I am out of insurance benefits), and I stretch, bend, and stretch that knee some more every 2 hours, even at night. You only really have to do the stretching at night for like 3 days. I set an alarm and understand my sleep will be wrecked for a few days, but know it's totally worth it. I am motivated and dedicated to doing it though, I do not want to go backwards. Hope this helps anyone looking into doing it. I am so happy, and wish I had done it a month ago.

The hospital have advised they want me to see the consultant who performed the arthroscopy I had in February but his list is even longer. I have looked into going private with this consultant but the cost over £11000 is quite considerable and I would have to finance that. Do I wait it out or give the private option more thought?

"Hey, how you going. Just thought id put this out to anyone who could possibly help. Im a 16 year old lad from Aus, weighing in at about 100kg/225lbs and 4 weeks ago i was playing touch rugby, i dove to take out a player and landed directly on my knee cap. Im one to often believe stuff like that just goes away so didnt do anything.
4 weeks on however the VMO on my left leg is still half the size of the VMO on my right leg and there is a soft, liquidy feeling when i press down between my knee and my VMO. I've spoken to a couple of people who believe that it is just bruising but considering its been 4 weeks im a little concerned.
In terms of pain, originally it hurt when I first did it however by that night I was fine, pain free. Im squatting rather heavy weights for high reps at the moment and after a big session the next day I can slightly feel a pulling from my VMO when I am in the lower squat position. I can also feel this pulling feeling when I do quad stretches. No pain as such though.
If anybody could reach out and help me that would be prime. Definitely dont want this to be bothering me for too long.
Much Appreciated, cheers.

I had an Mri done. The impression was : Grade 2 signal changes in posterior horn of medial meniscus.
I consulted with 4 doctors. Only one suggested Arthroscopy.
The knee locks infrequently.Doctors have said Quad excercises for 6 weeks and Ill be normal.
The problem is a week after the initial pain in right knee now my other knee has been showing the Same dull pain. But it comes rarely and hasnt locked or given away.
My info : I am 17 year old Male. Im a passionate basketball player. Like really intense.I had stopped basketball for a week due to ankle sprain on right leg when the knee pain began.
What im really worried about is that I hope i dont have some degenerative issue. As my standing x ray of both knees suggest joint space narrowing in medial part.But im just 17.But then again i didnt have any Trauma of knees. Can it happen aimply due to basketball ? Will i return to pre injury level ?

"Feeling annoyed now, second operation this year that has been cancelled the afternoon before i was due to go in for TKR. ( I was supposed to get a Spinal Fusion last January, but that was cancelled at the last minute due to the TKR and THR needed on my left side.
The TKR and THR were decided in May, i had to return after 6 wks so they could get MRI scans of my knee for the specific jigs i needed for the Op. I wqs informed that the date was likely to exceed the max  waiting time, but should only be a couple of weeks later if i remained at my local hospital, so i decided to stay with them (big mistake) 
!2 days ago i went for my second Pre Op, and met the Consultant again who said on leaving see you in 2 wks for the OP.
Yesterday at after 3 in the afternoon i get a call from some Operations manager saying the jig has not arrived and the Op's off, surely there's better planning than this? and alarm bells should start to ring a fortnight before if they dont have the parts.
The manager then said your Consultants booked up till the 21st Dec, do you want to come in then?? Something does not ring true here, and i am starting to think is our great NHS now priortising private patients in NHS hospitals?? Maybe the darlings don't want to come in at Xmas.
Disgusted.

"I am now 8 weeks post op TKA progress has been minimal the past 2 weeks even though I am in physical therapy 3x/week and doing all my home exercises.  Swelling is moderate, sleep elusive, pain extreme on extension after flexion (110 and -1).  Seems like I am regressing rather than getting better!  Now I am scheduled for a MOA of my new knee next week because of the massive scar tissue. What can I expect after this procedure?  Am I back to square one regarding pain and mobility?

"Hi everyone,  I had a TKR 4 and 1/2 months ago and I thought my knee should be great and all healed by now but as I am reading some of your experiences I have come to realize it takes a long time for a full recovery.  I had my TKR was up on a walker doing pt two hours later was released on second day.  I came home and like everyone else had problems sleeeping beause I was not a back sleeper and there was no way I could sleep on my side at that point.  I had my pt come to my house.  I used a walker for a week and then I was walking on my own.  My doctor wanted me to go to an outside PT because they can do more so I went for approximately 4 weeks about 2 to 3 times a week and then my PT said I really didn't need PT anymore.  My knee felt great I was bending it to the degrees they wanted so they released me.  Now I was still on pain medication and I was still not totally pain free but my knee felt great.  About 3 months after the TKR I fell and went down hard on both knees.  Since then I have been having trouble with my TKR.  It gets stiff very quickly.  I retain fluid anyway and have a hard time with swelling so I am guessing that this is cusing trouble for my knee.  I just don't know what to do at this point.  I was doing so well and now not so well.  It seems I have gone bakwards.  I am no longer on pain medication from the doctor I take tylenol when I have pain.   I am not sure what I should do.  I have read everyones postings and that shows me that everyone is different when it come to reovery.  I guess because of the fall  I should just keep doing my exercises and try keeping my fluid retention down and see how things goes over the next few months.

"Hi all tkr's I had my tkr 4 and a half weeks ago and experiencing a really painful sciatic type of pain in my left leg...starting from hip/lower back...into my knee then on top of my ankle. I have a clicking in the knee crease on the outer side of the knee which is not very painful when I flex or extend the leg. It almost feels like impingement and is hampering my rehab. Prior to the tkr I had a baker's cyst which my surgeon assured me was no longer there but that's exactly the spot in experiencing this pain. I therefore cannot extend my leg for any length of time when lying down and neither can I sleep on my left side. Has anyone else had this pain. Advice welcome...thankyou

"I am preparing for my tkr and feel like I will get truthful answers from the ones that have already gone through this more so than what the doctors will tell me.
I am reading that a lot of people are not able to drive for 4 plus weeks. Is this because of the drugs, the pain or because it's difficult to get in/out of cars. I understand there will be swelling and pain but what's keeping people from being able to drive?
I apologize if my ??? seem silly but I do better when I am able to process as much as I can before this surgery and to mentally prepare myself as much as I possibly can.
I know it will be worse than I expect but knowledge is power.

"I'm now 7 1/2 weeks post op ConforMIS TKR and 12 days post op MUA and still only at 85 bend with physical therapist pushing and still can't straighten. I am at -10 straighten. I have made small gains on bend since MUA, but straighten just isn't coming along. I work at it every day at home and have PT 3x a week. I saw pictures my doctor took while I was under for manipulation showing my knee will do it, but man were my muscles sore for 5 days . They are better now, but still very tight. Anyone have any words of wisdom that has been through this? Besides hearing "" it's early yet, and no one said it would be easy"". I'm 48 and I have been through alot of not easy in my life. Including aggressive breast cancer at 36 that I fought. So I'm not new to pain, but was told by my surgeon they would make me better. I wanted to stand straight again and walk without a limp. I'm not any better now than before, and hurt all the time now and didn't before. I hope in the next month things improve, because I still can't drive or work.

"Is it reasonable to expect to walk 6 weeks after a serious knee sprain? 
Had a motorcycle accident one month ago. The first three weeks, I had a plaster splint and couldn't walk. Now I have a leg cast due to a fractured patella that the doctor didn't notice during the first round of x-rays. Still feel pain inside the knee around the MCL ligament. The cast will come off in 2 weeks.
Of course I'll need PT when the cast come off, but is it reasonable to walk 6 weeks after a serious knee sprain? If I can't walk, then I'll definitley need an MRI to see if the damage is worse than the doctor originally thought.

"I had a cast removed for a fractured non-displaced patella at 4 1/2 weeks. Now it’s 5 weeks and I’m just wearing a knee brace, but with no screws so I can bend my knee. The doctor said it’s healing well, so the cast wasn’t necessary anymore.
I started to do some physical therapy but only with my leg straightened (such as leg lifts and calf exercises.  
Is it okay to do light weight bearing pt exercises with a bent knee? My knee is really stiff, so I think I need to start doing full range of motion exercises, but I’m just not sure if it’s okay to fully bend my knee.

"I read this forum a lot when I first had surgery. I thought I would come back and give you an update for those who are early in recovery. This week marks my 3 month anniversary. I was very, very nervous at first after surgery because I had trouble with my range of motion, I could not get past around 80 degrees at 3 weeks in. I was also afraid about how much medication I could take and whether I would be able to get off of it without cravings. As I look back I realize that every week showed improvement although sometimes it was slow. If I could say anything to those of you starting out, I would say be patient and positive. Do your exercises the best you can without causing yourself serious pain. If you can put up with the pain of physical therapy for a few weeks really intently, you will absolutely see positive results. Trust your body to do its part, you just have to do yours. I was the most skeptical of anyone, only because I could not see the results I wanted to see quickly enough. I am now happy with the progress. I'm walking a good deal and even though I still have some stiffness and some pain if I overdo it, I am not worried about healing fully by my one year mark as the eoctor said it takes that long. It is definitely happening for me and I know it will happen for you as well. I know it's hard, but try not to worry. Good luck to you in your healing process. I trust the worst is behind us all.

After reading some of the discussions this tkr sounds a lot more painful and difficult than I was thinking. I have been through breast cancer twice in the past six years, fractured my llowet back by falling off my mule and two fractures in my upper back due to osteoporosis. I have been thru a lot and this tkr is frightening to me. I can't stand being confined to the house. I take care of young adults and need to be able to chase after them and cannot be on pain meds and working.
I just turned 60 last week. Have any of you gone on disability because of the tkr?

"Hi,
Not too sure where to post this as we dont have a diagnosis yet...
14 Year old daughter who has been dancing for many years, approx 3 nights per week, has never had any knee issues or injuries.
4-5 months ago she started have sore knees, we thought it was just growing pains.
Knee's became so painful she had to stop dancing and walking was becoming difficult, doc susspected Osgood Schlatter syndrome.
1 month later my daughter cant go to school and is confined to a wheelchair at home, just too painful to even stand up.
Doc does not know, referred us to a pediatric speacialist who ordered x-ray, MRI's on both knees, bloods.
X-ray = normal
MRIx2 = normal
Blood tests incl Lupus = normal
She has full movement but just increadibly painful, she descibes it as bone on bone grinding.
Knees have NO swelling though are hot to touch.
NO redness
She has NO fever
The knees DO crack when she tries to move, this cracking sends a shooting pain down her calf and she is then in pain for several hours afterwards and crippled. We have been to various hospital emergency depts when this happens, they dont know the cause and can only offer drugs Endone which does not even help with the pain...
Pediatrician has referred us to a child Rheumatologist, waiting for appointment.
She has been off school for almost 3 months now and in a wheelchair for 2 months.
Any ideas appreciated...

"I'm 3.5 weeks out fm TKR.  I opted to go to treatment facility AKA nursing home.
i was there for 20 days, and during that time I was given an ice pack a total of 3 times.  Every day PTs would work with me for an hr or 2.  My knee never got loosened up.  Measuments stayed the same even tho I was doing the process.  It was very disappointing and discouraging
 Home health PT coming next week also home health nurse. In the few hours that I spent with them I found out more things that I did not know and should have known. I feel like I was done a disservice at the facility. One thing was I couldn't get my pain medicines  in a timely manner. Sometimes I had to wait an hour and a half just to get one pill. I would not recommend this to anyone I feel that I would do much better at home with the PT people who will be focusing on the areas  that need a in-depth attention. I spent a lot of time doing arm exercises riding a bicycle and putting puzzles together while I stand while I stood at a table. I am no further along than I was the day after surgery except that my knee is healing thank God. 
 I am very disappointed in my doctor in the facility and with the therapists who really I don't think I understood the severity of the swelling that I still have in my leg or should say knee.
hope I'll be able to straighten my leg again someday

"Those of us post-op (4 wks TKR) are now experiencing the ups and downs. There is a mass of good advice on this forum but for those of you facing surgery I thought I would share some thoughts for when you get home.  I tried to think of every scenario that might affect me (Army training) but failed !
1.Tiredness.  I am tough and fit but I was totally unprepared for the level of exhaustion I felt. Poor sleep in Hospital didn`t help, but at home every little thing became a major epic leaving me wiped out. My mood was up and down for a few days too. I even had a bout of unexplained tears, which passed but was very unsettling.
2.Toilet.  You will not make it in time!  Get sorted before going home, especially crucial is nightime - you don`t want to be struggling to get out of bed a few times in the night. You should be drinking a lot - there is a load of stuff to flush through and if you have a lot swelling, like me - well, it has to go somewhere!  Arrange your receptacles now.
3.Sleep.  Forget it!  Nights will be broken and disturbed . Have your own bed and room if possible so you can read, fidget and thrash about on your own. ( see 2 !). Otherwise a partner will go through the whole thing with you.
4.Furniture.   It will all be wrong! Too low, too soft, wrong shape, wrong size, no firm handholds etc.  For a while you will need to elevate your leg so you want a sofa you can lie on( and get off). Heavy swelling needs your leg to be above your heart for a good while.   Arrange tables around you with absolutely everything you might need (see2 !)
5 Worry.   Don`t get fixated on any of those ROM numbers - needless worry. Measure your bending by eye or invent a piece of cardboard. The key is progress. Keep a note every day, that way you can look back and see how well you are doing. Same with swelling - you may think it isn`t changing but if you measure and record , voila! - you will see the difference.
Everyone out there will have their own tales to tell and ,it`s true , there will be times you want to saw your leg off . But stick with it - the horror stories are few and after a while you`ll start to feel good again.
Good luck one and all ( don`t forget 2 !)

So, I asked my surgeon about a manipulation and now it's scheduled! I am praying it works. My ROM right now has me functioning and moving around pretty well, but still hard to get in and out of a chair, the car, the shower. Taking the dog out for a walk is hard.

"I am 42 years old and I had TKR on 9/14/16. The level of pain I was in following the days of my surgery was indescribable. Sleep was out of the question, getting in and out the bed was a task in itself. I was in constant pain, the exercises were painful and I felt as if I would never make any progress. The first time I was able to get out the bed without someone guiding my foot, I was excited. One of the worst things I had to deal with was the constipation. I actually had to go back to the hospital to remove blockage, my advice is to start taking laxatives right away, the stool softners are not strong enough for all of the narcotics in your system. I started home therapy right away and felt at times that yhe therapist was pushing me to fast. I was in a lot of pain and just couldn't bend my leg like they thought I should. I am now 4 weeks post surgery, the pain has gotten much better, I take fewer pain pills if any throughout the day, I keep my leg iced and elevated as much as I can. I am in my 3rd week of outpatient therapy and making progress on my bend. They want you to COMFORTABLY bend at about 110° I am currently at 95° on a good day. This surgery is BRUTAL but do your exercises, push through the pain, take your meds and eventually things will get better....Marsha

"hello to all here.
?I'll try to be as brief as possible. I had knee pain in both knees but worse in the left knee from 2013. After physio, cortisone injections (didn't work) x-rays, mri. Diagnosed with osteoarthritis.I was sent for an arthroscopy and micro-fracture in November 2014. This left me worse off. I was off work for 16 weeks - I need to be able to kneel, carry equipment and get up and down off the floor, also drive. Using the clutch in the car left me in tears. Every time I pressed the clutch down my knee would jolt and click through - hard to describe. In the meantime I had the same done to the right knee which was a success.
?Back into surgery for the left knee again. I had had further hyalorinic (??sp??) injections (no relief) This was in spring/summer 2015. The surgeon said the microfracture hadn't worked and he had taken out a flap or lump that was presumably causing the  jolting/jamming effect in the knee. It did get marginally better but has since deteriorated significantly. I am in constant pain. I have been prescribed co-codamol for the day and amytriptyline, 10mg, for the nerve pain at night. These don't really get rid of the pain. I also use voltarol gel on occasions.
If I have my knee at right angles when sitting it hurts - at home I sit with it up on a stool.  Bizarrely I can straighten my knee excellently. I can lift it and my mobility is good. I swam for many many years and the physio remarked that I have ""swimmers legs"" so I am quite strong. I have no swelling and never have done. I continue to do the exercises given to me after the first surgery.
?The pain is getting me down. I would like to sit in an upright chair without pain. I can no longer walk as much as I used to. Recently my knee has given way and I have fallen over twice in the last two weeks. I am nervous on stairs. My knee no longer feels safe.
?Is there a solution? I am 53. I understand the reluctance for replacement but really don't think this level of pain is realistic to manage for  long term. I am a little overweight - I know this doesn't help.
Any ideas I can take to the GP?

"Hi All! I'm new to the site...I had my TNR on my right knee in Jan of this year 2016. I will be having one on my left knee as soon as I'm ready. I was wondering if anyone else developed a horrible rash around their incision site? My incision was glued closed...my doctor isn't sure what caused it...allergic reaction to the glue or maybe to the stuff they use to prep the knee before surgery or???? It was awful, red bumpy rash that itched like crazy & took sometime to go away...on top of the pain from the knee surgery!!! Yikes!! I had to take antibiotics for weeks & then it FINALLY healed up. I would like to avoid this happening with my next replacement...has anyone experienced this reaction?? Thank you!

"Opinions welcome please. If you'e read any of my other posts you will have got the general picture that I am 10 weeks into TKR, have had little pain, can walk quite well but have limited range of movement most probably because i didn't have more than 90deg for  20 years or so (age 66 now). 
My PT up to now has been every 2-3 weeks where I have mostly just been rviewed as ""!doing great"" and been given exercises which I have been diligently doing. Whilst improvements all round none have made the slightest difference to my 6-90 deg other than maybe making that easier.
So at this appointment having expressed my disappointment with ROM  the PT said she wasn't worried about the bend because that is easier to get later than fully straightening. So I had my first real session from the PT. She massaged my leg a fair bit and then lying on my stomach forced my knee progressively straight by pushing down with it hanging over the bed. (An exercise I have tried a bit but just with gravity). This was quite painful, especially behind the knee which she kept massaging vigourously as she pushed down. Afterwards she claimed that she had got it to zero degrees.
So the question is how would I expect to feel after this manipulation? Because the next day (today) it is the stiffest and most aching it has felt so far. It only bends readily to 85 instead of 90 and doesn't really straighten any more unless forced and is tight behind the knee.
So is what I should expect - because it doesn't seem to have done much so far or will it be freerer when it gets over the initial shock?
Thanks for any opinions, (Chico et al)
Dave

"Hello My husband has a total neck fusion of 5 years and now has just got a TKR. He is constantly asking for tramadol which turns him into a zombie. I feel at 3 weeks out he is getting dependant on too much medication of Vicodine 325 mgs and is sometimes doubling it and demanding to have some tramadol (3 a night) and tizandine.  How much longer should I tolerate this?

"Months ago I told you how my power walking, stomping at great speeds through the street like a mad man caused me to loose balance and my body lost balance
From that in January of this year I have had horrendous trouble with my legs, burning tingling, like lots of electric activity running up and down the Leg, the leg feeling like its ballooned and twice the size when I walk
Things got a bit better after many many many months but I started walking long distance well 2-3 miles again at a good pace and today they are Rock solid, so stiff it's hard to walk 20 feet
All I want is to be able to excerise again, power walk go back to
aerobics but whenever I try and do anything these legs just don't seem to be able to do anything without causing me grief
I've been doctors, 5 different Pysiothreapist
No seems to know what's wrong
Maybe I need to stop the power walking but Its important to build up a sweat and feel exhausted, yet whenever I do anything regarding keep fit I pay the price for it
Yet I don't want to just do nothing, yet excerise is causing he horrendous grief
Please if you know of anything to get these legs normal again free and loose, I just want to be able to move than feeling a cripple im only 38
I feel like my life's ended
Love to you all for reading Kristian xx

"I had a motorcycle accident 4 weeks ago and I was diagnosed with a sprained knee and given a plaster splint on the back of the leg.
After a check up three weeks later, they spotted a fractured patella (lateral fracture) that they missed the first time and put me in a leg cast. The inner left side of my knee still hurts which indicates possible damaged MCL ligament.
Should I have MRI now or after my patella heals? I feel like my treatment has been wrong from the beginning as they didn't even spot my fractured patella and treated me only with a flimsy splint. I was waiting for insurance to approve an MRI, but I'd pay cash now to have it done tomorrow if I thought it was necessary.
So, should I take the cast off now and get an MRI or wait until patella heals then get MRI? Would hate to have to get surgery for MCL after all the time waiting for patella to heal... Wish they could both be treated at the same time.

"Hi everyone
It's been months since i last posted on this site.  I had my right TKR 10 months ago and will be having my left TKR op on Monday, i know what's in front of me this time so i'm hoping that will help me when things start getting me down, which they will becuase this is a long journey as we all know but here are some positives.  The stiffness gets better, you will stop shuffling along like one of the walking dead, the pain goes away, this is like a breath of fresh air, the tightness around the knee eases and you no longer feel that your head is going to explode because of the pressure.  The swelling goes away and you no longer feel your looking at an elephants leg,  I am going to keep all these thoughts in my head after the op because as stated by a few people already on this site i honestly don't think any of us are prepared for the long journey after surgery.  And i am going through it all again which proves that things get better or i could just be a crazy person lol.

"From what I have read online, it is not unusual to start having spasms in the back of the knee after a total knee replacement. I've read all kinds of theories about the cause, and tons of suggestions on how to deal with it.  But nobody mentions whether it eventually goes away or if it tends to become a lifelong chronic problem.
I had TKR 6 weeks ago and have spasms at night that throw me across the bed.  I can handle this, but would really like to know if this is something that should go away with time. 
I did did a lot of reading and studying before the surgery and I'm totally prepared for the various symptoms and understand that recovery is a long process, but I just can't find anything about whether the spasms are something that should go away. 
Could anyone one who has, or HAD, this problem please comment on whether it went away and how long it took?  Thanks so much!
By the way, the vast majority of the terrible TKR problems I read about never happened for me. I don't want to discourage anybody from having the surgery but I do strongly recommend reading everything you can so your expectations will be properly set.

I have set backs which have taught me that you have to do a little and then rest if you don't you will suffer. 
I find when I stand and walk my knee swells above and feels tight  Anyone else go through this?
Slow process but I do NOT have the excruciating pain I had before surgery, just the healing pain which is pretty good other then the swelling above my knee.
My range is now 130. Doing physio daily 
I found out today that the more physio you do faithfully, the better swelling will b and u will get stronger.

"I am 8 weeks post-open and around 3 weeks ago I started swelling above the knee joint. My physical therapists didn't think it looked abnormal, and when I saw my surgeon'said PA 2 weeks ago, he told me it was normal. I went back to work part time last week part time and noticed more swelling which I figured is normal since I went back to work. The swelling has gotten progressively worse, has moved to my upper thigh, calf, ankle and foot. I called the doc and they are getting me in today to take a look and make sure nothing is wrong. (god forbid). I will mention that before the swelling started, I was healing well, x-rays looked good, and I was progressing every week in physical ther any. Once the swelling started, I have not been able to progress with the flexion, stuck around 95 degrees. Anyone ever have an experience like this that can provide some insight as to what this excessive swelling is about? Also, NOTHING elevates it...ice, heat, elevation, compression, anti-inflammatory especially. HELP!

"I'm 13 wks po on my left knee and recently, I noticed my right knee is starting to ache. I have been told that because my right leg is over compensating for the left, it has started to hurt due to over use. Is this true? Could the pain I feel now in my right knee be related to the left? In 1986, I ruptured my left patellar tendon. When this surgery was done, the physician told me that I had weak patellar ligaments and more likely than not, I would rupture the right. In 1999, it came true and I ruptured the right. Since then, my knees have been a thorn in my flesh. Could anyone give me any insight please.

"Surgery on August 2. Developed a clot day after surgery, so have been on blood thinners since, and will be for another 3 weeks. As a result, swelling has been very tough to beat because I haven't been able to take any anti-inflammatories.
I stopped physio last week after getting to 134 and -1.  Knee was feeling as good as it could: walking with only a slight limp, driving, doing stairs just fine.  A little discomfort but nowhere near the pain I've had in the past.
So after graduating PT, I slacked off on my exercises: biked 1x/day, and did half the exercises I used to.  Now my knee is painful (probably a 4, but after living for three months with pain, who knows?) primarily on the outside and lower part of knee, and it clunks a lot, which I've come to expect. I probably know the answer (get back to exercising), but it seemed like it was doing so well and the PT said I could cut back.
Thoughts?  Don't beat me up too badly.

The revision did not go as planned due to complete destruction of ligaments, muscles and tendons. The prosthesis the Dr was forced to use is a hinged prosthesis that will not allow it to hyperextend but it has changed my walking pattern. It also is known to not last as long as 'standard' prothesis. The Dr told me no running ect. ever. This seemed ok because with the severe osteoarthritis I am not overly athletic anyway. But I had a full life. My range of motion is excellent at 4 weeks post-op and the pain is controllable, however my gait has changed and I am finding my already treated depression to be worsening.

I was quick (4 weeks) to get straight and bend to 135 degrees (awesome PT for 5 months, 2 times a week) but left knee seems to have lost about 25 degrees and seems swollen. Surgeon says all is good and that he ""did his part, now I need to do mine"" to get my body to adjust to new knees. I lost 30 lbs before surgery and 15 after surgery (could still lose 20 but I am no longer obese) and walk 2-5 miles a day, go to the gym 2-3 times a week with 20 minutes of bike and 40 minutes of weight and stretching. Surgeon says it could take 1-2 years for pain to go away. It feels like something is caught behind a (tendon, ligiament, muscle? I have no idea) as something pops over something else when I lift it sideways. Still very painful first steps and standing from a sitting position also. Any helpful ideas on the IT band thing. Internet says exercise not the answer but doesn't relly give a better answer.

"I've been posting on this forum since my knee op on 24th March this year (new plastic knee cap and metal trochlea). It's been a slow recovery for me due to muscle wastage and on June/July I started to feel very weepy, hot sweats, anxiety. Because of my age (I'm 56) I put this down to menopause and was prescribed HRT patches. However, this wasn't the case and since 25th November I've been on 50mg daily of the antidepressant sertraline, and the HRT patches have been confined to the bin.
Apparently depression following surgery is quite common, so my question to you all is has anyone else experienced this. The last three weeks have been a real rough ride and I'm feeling absolutely drained, but am hoping things will gradually improve. Funnily enough my knee now seems the least of my problems lol!

"Hi - I am wondering if anyone has any ideas please.
I am 6 weeks out from TKR on my right knee and all is going really well BUT i am having issues with my right foot.
I had two years of difficulty prior to my surgery and in that time my foot started to feel like it was turning in slightly and my two toes next to the big one started to cross over when I was weight bearing. Since surgery I have felt like I have a lump on the ball of my foot which PT says is the ball joint of the toes not staying in place. I haven't had pain from this just discomfort and a feeling like I am standing on a small ball. PT and doc have said it will alleviate as everything starts to work properly in allignment again but Now I am having very strong pain in the foot and yesterday putting any weight on the foot was excruciating. The top right hand side of my foot is very tender too.
I am hoping the experts are right and it is just part of the process but it is so frustrating as the knee is going very well and without the foot pain I would be feeling on top of the world.

"Fascinating forum. The difference in reported experiences is quite something.    I am 10 days post-op, tkr.   I can identify with many of you ,so far, and am keeping fingers crossed.
If I talk to anyone due to have this done I will start with these words - `you are going for major surgery, causing massive trauma to a weight bearing joint - you won`t be playing squash in2 weeks ! `.  Get real!!   Most of the advice on here is good and ,as many of you point out, there is no `norm` - we are all individual and respond and heal at different rates.
During my treatment so far I have been disappointed with some individuals who have followed a regimented line in answer to questions - `by day x you should be able to do this`, `expect to be on crutches for 3 months` etc etc.
Now , being an older, more cynical b****d I take all this with the scorn it deserves.With a leg twice its size a bend of 90 wasn`t going to happen - my body knows that!
Which is not to say that you ignore everything.Short bouts of execise are better than too much. And remember you will find bending and stretching much easier if you warm the muscles first with a hot water bottle. If you have swelling then get your leg up, with an ice pack for 20 mins followed by the heat treatment for 20, then rest.    This isn`t a race.   My goal is to get back on my bike, but I haven`t set a time scale - I`ll know when I`m ready.
Overdoing recovery in the early stages can lead to inflammation then infection - not a good place to be.
I have to get the swelling down and get rid of massive bruising - but despondent - no!
Let`s get the message out to everyone - by all means have expectations but you absolutely must be realistic !

"seaching for direction...
i am am now post op 8 weeks from having foot surgery to correct a callus on the bottom of my foot.  Doc removed 2 accessory bones and put in a screw to shift a bone over.  Was released from doc to ease back into normal routine...shoes/walking.  For the last week, I've been having pain in my knee (same leg), which continues to intensify. Tried icing,  Ibuprofen,  Tylenol, propped up, joint flex, tiger blam...nothing seems to give relief.  The last two nights, it has woke me up with throbbing pain.  
Tied to call foot doc yesterday, but no return call.  Made appointment with knee specialist next week.
any input or suggestions?

"I had a right TKR in 2005 and has been no trouble whatsoever, over the past six months or so it has started to clunk inside when I walk so I think it is probably coming to the end of its natural lifespan.
Two weeks ago I had a fall and broke my right ankle. I was admitted to hospital because the cause of the fall was a blackout, now the ankle pain was bad enough but the pain in my right knee was something else, I had to argue to get the knee x rayed, but was told there was nothing wrong with it. After a very bad night pain wise I tried to get the hospital staff to understand how bad this pain was and in the end a CT scan was done, again I was told there was nothing wrong, now I know my own body and how it behaves, I still do not believe there is nothing wrong, and the reason being I was sent home with one of those big ski boot walkers, but even now two weeks later it is the terrible pain on both sides of my knee that is giving me the most problem, it is so bad I don't want to walk on it at all.
Is it possible to dislodge a TKR because of a fall ?
Apologies for the long post.
Sean.

"For background, I have been doing 1 to 3, 8k runs per week, basically flat.  I’m mid 50s, thin build, always have had to watch to make sure I didn’t overdo it with respect to my knees.
A year ago I was completing an 8k run and decided for the last couple of hundred meters to really go for it.  Result: left knee seemed to have ITB syndrome which worked itself out more or less in about 5 months. Right knee: quad tendinitis.  For several months I would do the cross-rubbing right where the tendon joins the top of the patella.  It was painful  (5/10) when I took stairs and got up out of a chair, to tolerable (3 out of 10).
I saw a physiotherapist who confirmed the quad tendinitis and he gave me exercises to do (hip, quad stretch, another exercise for the muscles under the glutes, can’t remember what they’re called).  They helped, but the pain is still there after a year.
Lately I’ve noticed that the quad tendinitis pain is basically gone, but the whole region around the right kneecap (excluding the kneecap itself) is very sore when I try to stand up or climb stairs.  Every muscle above, and to the sides of the kneecap has shooting pain when I try to stand up.  I can get a less severe version of the pain by just clenching the muscles of the knee while sitting.
 What is this “syndrome”? As I say, I don’t have kneecap pain, just everything around the knee.  It’s been a year and I would absolutely love to get back to running!

"Hi everyone .. haven't really had a chance to get on here since my 2nd TKR .. I had alot of issues with the first one and still having them b4 2nd op .. but the pain throughout the first one was bearable and from the moment I got home I could manage pain and exercise no problems .. was able to use a mini peddle machine for up to 2hrs with no problems.
BUT....
Talk about not prepared for the pain of this 2nd one .. I've always thought I was very strong and had a very high pain tolerance .. well has this 2nd operation proved me wrong! 
I am in constant unbearable pain even while in hospital they had trouble trying to control my pain and had me on extreme high doses of narcs that they wanted me to continue but they forget in reality the doses they were wanting me to take drs just can't prescribe such high amounts.  I'm currently on 55mg of oxycontin and 6 endones a day (in hospital I was on 16! nearly a box a day).
I have heard on this forum before that people suffered with this type of pain and thought surely it couldn't be that bad .. well I'm eating my words now nothing stops the pain .. I ice ice ice and find that probably helps the most at times.  And exercises are sheer hell sometimes I cry just doing the smallest basic thing .. I do suffer with depression and have found that I've had to take a couple of extra valiums a day, dr said that would be due to the pain that I'm in.
When I first went to the drs I was very concerned about the colour of some weeping on my bandage so they sent me to the treatment room and cleaned the wound (this was 10 days post op) boy had I been lucky that my surgeon insisted before they took down my drip that they gave me 2 more lots of antibiotics... as when the nurse too the bandage off it had the spoils of an infection that had started but then had been stopped.
On day one the head physio came to see me with 2 students she stayed with me for an hour and was forcing my knee into all these positions and saying to the students that this is what someone should be able to do the day after surgery and she got me to a 95 ROM.  She left the room at one stage and the students said to me that they had been taught never to push like this physio did and especially for an hour for a first session... I agreed with them and we all said together she was having this awesome ego trip!  I don't know if it was just the surgery or her butchering me helped cause my pain.  I know each knee is different and boy has this been a learning lesson.  So many things that I've read on here have happened with this knee... I do know that there is a light at the end of tunnel that is still along way away yet!
I rang my surgeon the other day to double check that I had soluble stitches which he said I did and he said due to the pain I was in the most important thing was to still try and stay on top of it... which I'm finding so hard to do at the moment.
I just got my hubby to get my mini peddler to give it a go I did 5 full rotations, it killed me but I did it .. so different to the first knee that could do 2hrs+ from the moment I got home.
Sorry for this being an essay length post but I just know that you fellow sufferers/TKR's some will understand where I'm coming from and I have found this forum to be of such great value.

"I had bone on bone before my replacement it was initially a TKR than the surgeon decided to do a partial. Fast forward 10 weeks still need assistance to walk can't walk without either the walker or cane. Can not stand on my own even when using the cane or walker there is a lot of pressure to the front of the leg. Still have sensation issue cant wear anything over it or lay underneath blanket at night. Also feel this throbbing jumping in the front of the knee. Went to get a second opinion from another OS as to why I feel like im not healing properly and was told my implant is metal on metal and there may be a problem with the implant but I won't know until it has been removed. So I ask who is at fault for this being I have to have a 2nd surgery to hopefully fix the problem. No answers given just saying it can be several things that can cause this. Is there some oath that says one MD cannot accuse another MD of wrong doing. Anybody else considering sueing the OS due to additional surgery needed?

I had my tkr on 8th September and things are going as expected!
We have a walk-in shower with no way of fixing any grab handles or other permanent supports. I'm very aware that I could so easily slip and maybe undo all the surgeon's good work.
So we bought a loo surround and put in the cubicle. I had a shower on the day after I got home. I can use the loo surround to hold on to - and still do - and I use it as a walking frame so I can move away from the shower-head to dry myself.
I hope this helps other people to enjoy a shower safely!

I mentioned it to the therapist and they didn't seem concerned. Well to cut to the chase, I am 64 and have always been knock-kneed, and my
doctor decided to straighten my leg during the operation. So now my operated leg is over 1/2"" to 3/8"" longer than the other. my doctor never discussed That he was going to straighten my leg and now have to deal with rehab and the reality of 2 legs  that are different lengths. My hips hurt, my spine aches, I need shims in my shoes. I went to my surgeon and asked him why he never told me my legs would be different lengths and he said I will need to use ordhodics or get my other knee straightened in a few years. This is nuts. My other knee is just fine.  I am going to have to get another educated opinion on my options because I am in a real bind.

"Here is an update on my knee. I write earlier that my knee was collapsing and painful when walking and sometimes standing. I am 10 months out. I went to another doctor, on request of my regular knee Doctor to get a second option. He confirmed that my knee is unstable. It is not very bad so He suggested surgery to take out the plastic middle and replace it with a thicker one so as to tighten the ligaments. But I was to be prepare , if the doctor didn't like the way it moved,he would do a complete knee revision. Now I know what is wrong I feel better but not looking forward to having to go through this pain And rehab all over again. I was doing so good and about 7 months in this happened. This will make my 6th surgery in 4 years ( I had three foot surgeries and one knee scope before my tkr). This has been a hard one to mentally cope with. I guess because I know what I'm in for. I'm praying this surgery will go smoothly and recovery will be easier. I can always hope , right? I am thankful for this blog. It helps to be able to vent.

"After seeing my surgeon in february this year i've had several xrays and an mri scan of my right knee and have finally made it to the top of the waiting list! I am in such horrible pain and am almost housebound, just walking a couple of yards and I need to sit down.
I think that because the pain is so bad and I've had it for about 15 years although the pain has definately worsened in the last 12 months I can't imagine it going away. Apparently my knee is full of debris and I have a meniscal tear which will be cleaned out and repaired.
My left knee has quite severe OA  but it is nowhere near as painful as my right knee strangely. Just walking (staggering) around the house exhausts me and my grandchildren being here for the day knocks me for six.

"Hi folks,
Would appreciate some brainstorming on an on going situation I am trying to get under control.
I am trying to get on top off of recurring knee and ankle issues but it's difficult to break the cycle.
As context I've had 3 kneecap dislocations -- age 13, 16 and 24. The most recent, age 24, was about 2 years and 8 months ago.
After the first two I more or less recovered normally with some discomfort after, though after the most recent one it has been a challenge.
More recently, eg the past couple of years, I've had ankle problems that when combined with the knee stuff make it hard to get momentum on any kind of program.
The problem with the knee right now is that it is 8-10 degrees short of full extension and in each of the last 2 April's I've had incidents where it has blown up seemingly unprovoked (massive swelling and quad/hamstring stiffness). In both cases I really just woke up with it and have no idea what happened.
I had an MRI in Sept 2015 that was essentially clean -- no meniscus issues, which is what an experienced chiropractor had thought clinically presented during the April knee blow-ups.
I saw a sports doctor in June 2016 and received a cortisone injection into the knee that has had some decent short-term effect. The swelling is down and it is generally closer to fully functional, though the extension has not improved, which is a major concern. It is not pain or swelling free post-cortisone, but I feel that there are situations where pre-cortisone it would have been a lot worse, if that makes sense.
The real problem is the on-going ankle issues. The first major one I can think of was May 2015 -- I just developed deep pain and swelling, and was told I had sprained it, but I can't think of any incident where that could have happened.
Once that settled down I was able to get through the summer, fall and most of winter feeling decently. I did have an incident where one of the ankles was in rough shape in February or so, but again I can't think of a trigger incident.
Over the winter, January-February, I got back onto a good physio program and was making good gains in knee muscle mass and generally feeling better. Then in April 2016 the knee swelled up massively for no apparent reason and I was not doing much for a good couple of weeks.
Then, right as I was getting over that and thinking of getting back into physio on the knee, there was an ankle incident -- again, no obvious trigger.
I then received the cortisone shot in early June and things somewhat/mostly stabilized for a bit. Late July, I had -another- ankle incident that took a week or ten days to stabilize, most of August was fine, then most recently I went through a period of 5 or so days of doing a lot of walking (I was feeling great ironically) and the ankle issue happened again.
So you can see and understand why it is hard for me to get much momentum going on anything.
I would identify a couple structural challenges at this point to a recovery:
1) General muscle stiffness everywhere in my lower body makes it hard to start exercising without feeling really sore
2) Fear of exercising causing another flare up – if something nasty happens I can be almost nonfunctional for the better part of a week, which isn’t really practical. It holds me back from just jumping into an exercise program.
I am the first person to agree that this could have been much better addressed in my teens and early 20’s (now almost 27) and that my own laziness (I find exercise incredibly boring) is a major factor in why it’s gotten to this stage. That said, at this point I am constantly thinking of how and what I can do to get better, so I honestly believe that the barriers I describe above are real and not just me being lazy and coming up with reasons to avoid doing anything about it.
I have a couple advantages to work with here:
1) Day to day I am still more or less entirely functional unless an acute episode such as an ankle “sprain” (quotation marks because I can’t ever think of spraining them, despite the sprain-like symptoms!) or knee flare-up have hit me. So fortunately I am not as far gone as a lot of people could be.
2) I have the resources and job/life flexibility to access top notch physio care
My general ideas are as follows:
1) Possibly return to sports medicine doctor for an update on me knee and perhaps further treatment – he had suggested maybe trying Platemet Rich Plasma, a cutting-edge treatment that apparently can be effective for healing, if the cortisone didn’t fix things. Perhaps I could also ask about cortisone in my ankles to grant me a period of stability?
2) Intensive rehab – the problem is I need a facility and therapist who can work with me daily and see how I respond to different things – for example if a certain new exercise or kind of stretching causes a flare-up that incapacitates me for a few days, I need the person who prescribed that to see what happened and treat it and then adjust what I can do, rather than just treating the flare-up ad hoc and then trying to get back to things.
3) While I work at a desk and don’t have much physical strain at work, the issue of being out for 8-10 hours a day can feel like a burden if I am trying to get on a program and especially if I have a flare-up that needs a lot of pain management and treatment to get back to a place where I can be comfortable and start doing activities again. I think I am at a place in job/life where I could take a few weeks off to do nothing but physio and get things back on track.

"Hi All, I had my knee replaced about 9 years ago...did not have many issues. The replacement was a success as far as I was concerned.   But, all of a sudden, since the first of July 2016, I have had these terrible ""attacks""...it starts with terrible pain in the back of knee, incredible pain!  Hard to describe, almost 10 out 10 pain...can't walk on it, move it, walk on it, lift it.  These attacks usually last about 12 hours...I rest it and ice it.  It slowly recovers, stiff and sore, but I regain some mobility.  I work in the school system so just kind of assumed these attacks would work themselves out over the summer...though maybe I pulled something.  My first attack happened while I was cleaning my daughter's room....no serious trauma.   I am scheduled to see my surgeon October 21st and my other knee is so terrible that it has to be replaced in the next year or so, according to my surgeon.  An x-ray showed Knee replacement in proper alignment.  I have these attacks weekly and they are getting to be more frequent.  In between, my knee very stiff and very sore, lots of pain.  I have been to physio which has helped relieve the painful muscles associated with this...but it has not fixed it.  I have also tried cupping and accupuncture.  I am stumped.  I did go on a trampoline field trip with my class of pre-kindergarten's in June...I don't know if that has anything to do with it.  Any information, or any advice.  One physio told me that she didnt' thing my replacement was ""normal""...another said it had to do with my knee or ankle...anyone out there with similar issues?  Thanking you!

Whats that..?totally backwards in time right now.Have to say ..since my 1st knee replacement have learned...dont be brave ...take pain meds...regularly and keep in your system or you wont be able to move and do your therepy. If what you have meds. wise doesnt work ...get them to give you something that does..Id say...first 8wks..are crazy ..after that starts to work in your favor.Ice is very important,helps keep swelling down and inflamation thats what makes it harder to move.I will agree that once you get passed 6 to 8 months you will be glad you had it done.although I realize there are those few exceptions.Trying to stay hopeful going through this my second time around knowing this will eventual feel better.My first knee has some tightness at times but atleast no more pain from bone on bone. Getti g older makes things ache unfortunatly. Glad im on the recovery side of things now. Hoping I help someone to feel that it does eventually get better.good luck to you all.

"Although I was diagnosed with MS in 2010 I am normally a fairly active person.
That was until I had TKR in February 2016.
It seemed all around me people my age (67) were having knees done and apparently seemed fine afterwards.
Mine is not the case. It's all been a nightmare. My general health has taken a real battering
It's been nearly 7 months and I'm reliant on crutches. The pain wakes me in the night. It's all far worse than how I was before the op. I'm practically crippled now.
I am aware that any kind of trauma to the body could spark a MS flare-up and I'm just hoping this is not the case.
However, it does make me think that the Anaesthetist
didn't even know I had MS even though I told the consultant.
Surely there should be more research done on ops for MS sufferers

"Hi all I was wondering if anyone else got the new pain cathater with knee replacement. It's brand new they only started it in our hospital 2 weeks before I had mine that was 8 weeks ago. It's a baseball size bottle full of numbing meds. It was placed in my leg about 3 inches from my incision and its in a little black bag with a shoulder strap so you can carry it with you. It releases numbing medicine on top of your knee continuously. It's lasts 5 days then you just pull it out at home. It was amazing. I definitely could feel the difference once it was gone. Also my dr used super glue to close my incision then when I went home the bandage he put on it was called a honeycomb and you can shower with it on. My dr does nothing but knee replacements all day long so he's good at it. I feel so blessed to have him.

My recent knee did some things better,  it seems to be not getting rom as fast, it aches at night, my calf and top of my foot.

When I got home I was getting off of my couch, which is low, I have been gettin off of recently, with some pain, this time I felt that I was tearing the inside of my knee open, the part that faces the other knee, now my other one is so sore.  If I even try to get up off an little low seat, it kills me. Plus my back(Hip). I'm calling my ortho today.

"I have read lots about scar tissue problems on this forum. Can someone explain to me what it is, how to recognise it and how it is formed, please?
In short, I had a TKR August 2015 and recovery while not easy nor painfree was progressing nicely with good bends and straights.
A while ago I tripped and since then the knee has been painful and stiff.  I had my year check at the beginning of September and the Consultant assured me that the xray showed that the inplant was fine.  He said to give it a couple of months before worrying. However, the knee is still very stiff and not as flexible as it was before the fall.
Could this be due to scar tissue forming, or should I really just be more patient?
Thanks

"Unsure if this is the best forum to post in ; if not please post me in the right direction.
Brief summary of what I am experiencing ; have had knee problems for 2~3 years, in the last 2 weeks I have started getting very bad pains in my shin (of the same leg as the bad knee), kind of comes in waves, to the right of the shin bone (not quite in the bone), and it only happens when I am lying down (so mostly at night). When I am walking, I am fine (although I might feel a twinge)
I'm Male, 30, 77kg at 178cm, in good shape/health overall. 
Background : 
I have had on/off knee pains for a while, maybe 2-3 years approx. I would describe this pain as a dull aching pain at the front of the knee cap, most often present when lying in bed at night or sitting down (not really affecting me when im in motion). It would be worse when I do squatting or lunging motions, extending the knee out. 
I was living in Mexico last year, and eventually had an MRI done, and was diagnosed with a partially torn ACL. It wasnt severe enough for surgery (so I was told), and a doctor did a PRP (platelet rich plasta) injection. This actually seemed to solve my problem, and my knee pain went away for a period of time. 
This year, I am back living in Ireland. I had been away from exercise for 3-4 months due to having a Corneal Transplant. About 1 month after returning to the gym, my knee pain came back. I decided to go see a Surgeon here. I had an MRI done. I showed him the previous MRI also. He disagrees with the previous diagnosis, and says my ACL is fine, and the new/current MRI says that there is absolutely nothing wrong with my knee. He is not sure what is causing my knee pain. I am inclined to trust this Doctor and Diagnosis more than my doctor in Mexico. He decided to do a steroid injection for the pain, as an attempt to figure out if the pain was actually in the knee or not..eg if the pain goes away, we know its in the knee, if doesnt, then we can assume/presume its some form of referred pain and proceed as such . I had this injection 1.5 weeks ago and it hasnt helped much. 
Around the time I went to see him first (~2.5 weeks ago) I started to get bad pains in my shin (same leg) at night. Note, this started before the steroid injection (but not long before) so I dont think its a reaction to it. This is much much worse than my knee pain. It comes in waves and prevents me from being able to get to sleep. It is not really present/noticeable when I am not lying down. It is slightly to the right of the shin bone (on my right leg). I dont think its the bone, it feels more like its in the muscle, although I cant be sure. My leg doesnt look different at all. no redness, swelling, anything like that. It doesnt feel sore to the touch at all (even when the pain is coming in waves, its not sore to the touch, its just pain ""beneath the skin"" I guess. 
Other possible relevant information is I am on a low dose of steroids (prednisolone 5mg) for a corneal transplant I had 5 months ago, and also steroid eye drops. 
So yeah, thats where I am at now. I am now much more concerned with the shin problem than the knee problem, but I assume they are connected?
Looking for advice on what the cause could be here and what treatment options to pursue. I will see the orthopedic Surgeon again on Monday and see what he suggests. 
Thanks for any advice.

So I am now post ops 14 and 9 months. It's been hard work but can now do many things I couldn't manage before! Still can't kneel but everything else is virtually painless. Even managed to RUN downstairs this morning, but be careful!!
Have found swimming the best for strengthening and easing stiffness and using Bio-oil on the scars helps enormously fading.

"Last pt visit my knee was able to bend 110, but the exercises they put me through left me so sore and swollen that I had to have two days to just rest up.  Last night I was able to bend a bit over 90 because of the stiffness.  I figure I know how to strengthn the quads and can do so within my particular limits so that I don't have these set-backs.  This is the second pt clinic I have been too and they've been great.  But I think these young therapiists in their 2o's can't appreciate the limits of someone in their 60's who has RA to also contend with.  If need be I can have my husband help push extra degrees with me when I am going for more ROM.  I also want to go back to our fitness club and use the therapy pool.  I'm looking forward to not being sore all the time and waking up at night in pain.  I have voltaren gel but it can only do so much.  I don't know if my husband can do what is needed when I complain about it hurting, but he has offered to help.  I also want to get this knee fully healed because I have the other one that will need TKR in a year or so.  It bothers me that I hear so many talk about pain, swelling, and stiffness even after 6 months.  I feel very fortunate that I don't have a job I have to go back to and be on my feet all day like some.  TKRs are definately something to put off till you are retired, if at all possible. 
Thought I would check in with some of you TKR people and see if you felt the same and did okay working the rest of the bend on your own, because I sure don't want to settle for less ROM than I should have.

"well just checking in as the surgery went ahead and I am now 6 days post TKR on my left knee. am 50 and live alone, but am staying with family for a few days before going back to my flat.
my biggest impression so far is that even though I did lots of research, and was also aware that there would be a lot of pain, this has still been one of the most difficult things in my life so far.
 am getting around the house on crutches and only need to tackle stairs twice a day, but am still finding I need an afternoon nap. am also finding it very difficullt to do some of the exercises as well, but maybe that will improve as the swelling continues to go down. am also aware that it is very early days yet and only came home 2 days ago.  
 so just wanted to say to anyone in the same position or about to undergo this surgery- listen to your body and be kind to yourself.  take your painkillers regularly, don't wait for the pain to become bad, and insist on extra doses while in the hospital if you need them, don't let them tell you that you should be at a different stage or that people normally don't need that drug by now, it will be impossible to participate properly in your physio unless there is some pain control.
rest when you need to, use your ice and sleep when you can, I am luckier than some people on here in that I can fall asleep, although much earlier than my usual bedtime, but am woken at least once overnight by pain, so the painkillers live right next to me overnight. It does take at least an hour to sleep again when this occurs.
eat whatever you fancy, you might find light meals easier, and drink as much as you can to prevent dehydration (non alcoholic due to being on the codeine but I have no fancy for that at the moment anyway). 
well that's all I have to say from my very limited experience so far. am still just taking it day to day and trying to think ahead to a time when I will feel the full benefit of this.
wishing good luck to all those going through it with me

"From around about April this year I startex feeling a heavy ache in my knee when lifting it to step onto the pavement eyc. Gradually my symptoms appeared more often and would effect me walking properly. I was quite active doing squats and lunges around this time. Walking for a period of time would result in limping and medial knee pain. I began by getting physio to loosen ofc tight quads and the muscle inside my thigh.
Things continued to worsen and intensify. My low quads often felt as though they were going to snap and walking resulted in constant stabbing pain in the medial area.
I got a kned MRI and it was fine. The Dr then thougjt I had a labral tear because now I was experiencing slight groin and hip aches. I got an MRA of the hip and overall thats ok too. My Orphopedic Dr wants to operate on my hip and see what he can find but that terrifies me! My hip might be perfectly fine so why operate?
When I am sitting I can feel pain in my buttock and back of hamstrings, the low quads will also tingle and sting too. I wonder if I have a muscle inbalce, glute problems and Im trying to find answers without surgery!

"hi last year I came on this sight.  I had a half knee replacement in left then right leg, here I am again , the other side of both knees has gone . So now I am having to do walking biking swimming plus exercises trying to prolong having to have full knee on both legs, if steroid injections work then I might get four years, last time they  tried steroids they didn't work. , I'm pretty fit anyway, I'm 55 a nutritional weight consultant, active. I also have to have a jaw joint replacement. God knows what I've done to deserve all this.

"Evening all, I had T.K.R ( left knee ) in November last year, still numb on the outside. What is concerning me is apart from a whole lot of different pain is now at the front of my knee going off to the right hand side I can feel a lump and it can be moved around.
Feeling on my right knee there is nothing like this. I am on holiday abroad at the moment so can't get to see anybody till the end of net week, was hoping someone here might have an idea what it is.

"had my TKR done on May 12, 2016. I had at home PT for a week and then started going three day a week. I tried to do at home exercises but just was unable to get much done. After about 13 weeks my PT was stopped due to lack of progress. I was only at about 78 degrees. My surgeon finally agreed to do a MUA, on August 8th this was done. I had four straight days of PT and have just completed another 5 weeks of PT. I still have not been able to get much past the 78 degrees. My PT visit last Friday was unreal as I was manipulated twice by sheer power. I was in such pain and still  five days later find it is almost impossible to walk. We (PT & me) are talking about maybe a splint or even another MUA. I can't take the pain of being forced into a knee bend but have no idea what to do next. My PT had all along said progress was normal but now he has changed his tune a little. I know and he knows that yes he can get me to bend but the pain and amount of work to do it are unfair to me. My knee feels like it's locking when I try to stand or rotate my legs while laying in bed. I've also been dealing with some sort of nerve problem since my surgery my leg is hypersensitive which compounds matters.
Any words of encouragement will help but I really need some sound advice as to what to try next.

"My wife had a TKR in 2007. Had to be replaced in 2009 because of instability. The revision was constant pain for years. Was told it was bersitis or her back. This year a sore developed below the knee, started oozing a clear liquid plus stinky pus. She finally found someone that set her up for an MRI, which indicated that the knee was totally infected. Later the revision was removed plus several inches of bone on the upper side & replaced with an oversize spacer. She also had another surgery weeks later to have a foot of muscle from her lower calf (same leg) remove & placed in the hole that had oozed the pus,etc. Also had to have skin removed from her upper thigh to cover the the hole. She spent 2 weeks in the hospital & now near  3 weeks in a rehab. She has a total of 5 infections , cannot put any weight on leg whatsoever, cannot get out of bed without a couple to help her . The Dr. claimed that if all went well, she might be clear of the infection in 3 months. Meanwhile, she is in terrible pain anytime anyone even tries to move the leg. Has anyone else ever had or knows someone that might have had something similar ?

"Hi everyone. I am at 5 months and two weeks post bi-lateral tkr's. I am in Australia now and have been plodding along slowly getting back to a life without pain and including travel, which is really great BUT my balance is not perfect and also I've developed a small bump in my right knee after I used fixed metal steps to enter a pool, on a recent 6 week holiday, in Asia. I put my total 72.3 kg weight on my right knee and I am not due to see my surgeon for my 6 month check up until September 22. I have recently returned home on September 1.
Has anyone developed any bumps under the scar line? It's not painful, it just looks weird. It could be muscle or fluid I guess. I've found my GP to be pretty hopeless when it comes to my knee and subsequent rehabilitation. I've learnt to be pro active and because my sister is soon to have a similar operation on her left knee I've advised her to use this website as a information and learning resource and to educate herself on what to expect. Any relevant input would be much appreciated.

"My tkr on my left knee was 3 months ago. I was so lucky to have almost no pain after surgery but PT has been hard! I am a 69 year old female a bit overweight because of the lack of activity for months before my surgery. Anyway I was out of shape and muscles had gotten weak making PT harder. I was doing well, my ROM is 115-118. I have no problems with it going straight. The PT has gone to more intense. I have a hip that needs replacement as well as my other knee. I did very well at first and was almost ready to give up the cane, I often did not use it at all in the house. Now after them adding the bicycle and heavier weights at PT I am almost ready to dig out my walker! I can barely walk and put a huge amount of weight on my cane. At home I ice and elevate as often as possible. Every weekend when I have not had PT for a few days I begin to improve and feel better. My question is am I doing too much at PT? Should I be slowing down with it or will that hurt my recovery long term? My surgeon said PT was up to me now as he felt 118 was good enough. My therapist wants me to do a few more weeks and reach 120 and build more strength. I would agree but am getting very depressed with the pain. I used to leave PT feeling energized and limber, now I leave in pain and holding onto my cane for dear life. Hubby is about to have back surgery and I have taken on a lot more work at home then before. Not sure what to do, need opinions from those of you who have done both. I have a pool at home that I have used once or twice a week, but weather is changing and not sure how much longer that will be possible. I also have a recumbent bike and was doing 7 minutes on it but it is one of the things that really gets my hip and knees aching. A lot of my pain is coming from the bad hip and bad knee but some comes from back of calve of lower tkr leg. Help this has me ready to quit PT.

"Had a routine visit with my surgeon yesterday and he's really happy with how my R-TKR is going altho I've still got a few issues.  I was telling him how my left knee which was as bad as my right was stopping me from alot of exercises which he understood .. and he asked when did I want the next one done and I just replied with asap.  Next thing he said I can give you a date and I'm thinking to myself oh yeah it'll be like the first one and a 4wk wait and he comes back and says 8am Monday and I go this Monday and he says yes .. sort of hit me when I was expecting about a months wait .. he said he had a cancellation and he might as well slip me in to get it over and done with.
I'm so looking forward that I'll finally be able to get further with both knees in time .. but at the same time as much as my left knee is so painful and hinders alot of what I do I'm sad that I'll no longer have the feeling of a normal knee .. as after 11mths I'm still not used to the feeling of my new knee.  But in saying that I know it's something that has to be done.
For those of you that don't know my story I was run over by a truck that totally wrecked both knees and alot of other things .. but getting my knees approved by the government insurance company as they are responsible for all my injuries and bills initially took them 6yrs to approve my knee surgeries .. they were apprehensive as they were the biggest expense for them and if anything ever happens to them they are responsible for the rest of my life.
Thanks for listening... Tracey

"Hi everyone. I had a TKR in May 2015 and though difficult I've made progress over the last months and although my knee swells now and again it is generally free from any pain. Today, out of the blue, I've had severe pain in my leg from the new knee area itself down to the ankle and up to the hop and lower back. I've been trying wading in swimming pools a few times whilst on holiday in Spain (I can't swim) as I heard the exercise would be good. Could it be I've done something? I've only done half an hour a day doing this wading with water up to around my waist or just above. I'm very disappointed as I've had no pain like this in my new knee/leg since the op 16 months ago. I did have sciatica trouble before the op and have spondylosis in the lower lumbar area. I'm also waiting to get my other knee replaced as this is causing much pain including referred pain to the hip area. I'm very disappointed!

Sent records to a doctor in Lincoln, NE he said go to pain management. Been there, done that. Been waiting almost two months for a doctor in Omaha, NE to look at my records. They told me he would have to review before he saw me. Just found out today he is too busy to look at records. And he only looks at records that are sent from another doctor. Very, very disapointing.

Yesterday, I thought that because my knee felt stiffer than the day before, I must be doing something wrong..or not doing enough. Now I realise what   a long process this will be. I sleep so badly. Nowhere is comfortable. I have an almost continuous ache along the outside of my leg and many other intermittent pains, soreness and stinging sensations. Getting in and out of bed, up and down out of chairs and going to the bathroom are all awkward and involve pain and all activities take 5 times longer than they did pre op. I have found the best way to get in and out of bed is to place my good leg under my operated leg at the heel and use it as support to lower/raise my legs to the floor or bed. It's a great technique!

Usually depression is established after a month of time.  You are in pain, taking pain meds, feeling guilty because you are in bed and everyone is use to you being the person that works and contributes.

"Hello folks,
Not really sure where to start..
Im a 39 year old male (40 in October), who used to be fit and sporty. I played football twice a week, and weight trained 4-5 days a week.
4 years ago while playing football my right knee kind of disitergrated, nobody touched me I was sprinting after the ball and realised I wasn't going to get to it before it went out. So I put the brakes on and the bottom part of my knee stopped, but the top half didnt.
I suffered articular cartlidge damage, damaged liagaments, and I suspect a meniscus tear (will explain shortly).
3 months after the injury and after virtually shouting at the docs that there was something pretty wrong with my knee (they just kept telling me it was a sprain, but it was locking up and I had lumps sticking through the skin), I finally got to see a specialist, an MRI, and my first artroscopy.
The surgeon said that he has cleaned the joint out, and smoothed over the surface damage. I had lost a lost of muscle in my leg, and the swelling was crazy so it took me months before I could walk on it properly again. When I did get back to my feet my knee lasted out about 10-12 months before giving out. I rested it, and it seemed to recover. It lasted a few months and gave out again, recovered, gave out repeat until I lost the will to live.  And each time gradually, the gap between the breakdowns got smaller.
So, I ended up back to see another specialist, another MRI scan, and another arthroscopy. The scan showed a meniscus tear, but when I awoke from the op, the surgeon said he could find no tear, so he'd ""tidied it up"". 
It didnt really help, and I continued to struggle on until it became so bad that I just couldn't function anymore...I had been to my GP who told me that he thought ""it wasn't as bad as I belived"". I virtually begged him to refere me.  With my knee breaking down physically almost every week, I reached a point where I broke mentally. Becoming more and more confined to my room, I just broke down in tears one day and went back to my GP again... I broke down in front of him and he refered me.
So in June this year, another MRI, another ""specialist""... the scan showed a large meniscus tear (clevage tear). Another arthroscopy followed, the damaged meniscus was removed, and I was told I had ""surface damage"" which I guess is articular damage which was again smoothed over.
I felt a small amount of  relief and remained fuctional (I got the odd jab, stab etc) until 2 weeks ago when it broke down again. I have iced it, rested it etc. I began to be able to walk on it again a few days ago, today it gave out on me again. Honestly guys, I am at the end of my tether.... and mentally I am really struggling.  I have battled anxiety and depresion most of my life (before the injury), but I'm really struggling to stay positive.
One thing I forgot to say here is that throughout I have tried to keep my muscles as strong as I can, the period I just had after the last arthroscopy until the recent breakdown I managed to get on my magnetic exercise bike twice a week and I have a leg machine from my gym days so I had been using that... my muscle strength had gone through the roof compared to where I was, and yet I have still broken down.
To explain the ""break downs"", it feels like the joint slips and the pain is on the inside of my right knee. It is a searing, sharp pain that you cant bear weight on (exactly the same pain from the original injury, in exactly the same place)... its like I keep getting the same injury over and over, and over again. The worse thing is I don't even have to be doing anyhing other than just walking for it to go, it just gives out anytime, anywhere, without reason.
I really dont know what to do guys, I am feeling like giving up, like my life is over at 39. I have two small kids (6 and 8) and a wife, I can't do anything with them. We used to go for walks together, but even a trip out to the shops now is sometimes more than I can manage. I feel like I can't give them the life that they deserve, like I'm wasting my and their best years, and I am so frustrated. I also have my own business, and trying to run that when you can't walk is very very difficult. I worry the day is coming when I won't be able to support them.
I do apologise to people if this is out of place on here or a little heavy, I've never really posted anything like this before... and if I'm honest it is out of pure desperation.
I just want the nightmare to go away, and to get my life back :-(

"I am 6 weeks post op of a partial knee replacement on my right knee. I have been having physiotherapy twice a week. I am frustrated as I am still in a lot of pain mainly when walking I am taking narcotic pain relief which eases the pain. I am walking short distances (around the house) unaided but use a walking stick when I go out. I am not driving as I don't feel confident to do so as well as taking pain meds.
The physiotherapist says my movement is going well.
The issue is the amount of pain I am having I thought by week six it would have eased by now. I have not returned to work due to the pain and unable to drive. Should I still be having this much pain when I walk? I feel like I must be doing something wrong.

"I have enjoyed reading where all of you are at post surgery. I will in three days be at week seven.  I think the worst thing happening to me right now is I wake up in the morning, I see my leg in the same position as it was when I went to sleep.  Did not move all night.  I start to pull my leg up towards me, and the pain is bad.  Let me discribe it to you.  It is a burning pain, like my leg is on fire.  The skin is tight and the skin and under the skin just burns.  The burning does go away and I am fine for the rest of the day, but waking up in the morning is brutal.  
I also have a hard time waking up.  I am sleeping in to ten in the morning. No place to go, so that is kinda nice, but am worried if I am getting to use to the meds.  Trying to get off of them and have cut the meds to half of what I use to take.
Any suggestions on knees burning and sleeping so much.

Toward the end of PT my knee began ""popping"". At first it was just a nuisance, the PT taped my knee several times and I was sent back to my surgeon for a special knee brace to hold my patella that I was told was tracking laterally. Then came the pain with the popping. After PT, I joined the gym. Stuck with all the same equipment and excersizes recommended by PT and added water excersize. My goal was to strengthen all muscles surrounding my knee. I've tried long enough. Now I'm scheduled for a ""scope"" on 9-12-16 to clean out the scar tissue that my surgeon states is there. Needless to say, I'm leery about having my knee opened up again. Please, any advice is helpful. Thanks

"I have given some advise to a friend who will be going thru tkr soon. First one knee then the other. Question I have is "" has any one heard of a doctor that wants his patient to just walk around house for 3 months then do therapy for 4?"" He was told to...take it easy and then after therapy he will do other knee. Which means no work for a year! Any input will help. He will be joining forum soon to get as much info before surgery as he can.

"My sister underwent a TKR very recently. The surgeon damaged a ligament whilst performing the TKR and now she has to wear a big, cumbersome brace set at maximum 90 degree bend. What impact will this have on her recovery and knee outcome as I cannot gain access to her surgeon and nursing staff are ducking and weaving my questions, as per usual? Thanks!

"Hi I'm 56 and had a knee replacement on August 10th. That makes it 4 weeks post op. My flexion is good. I have no problem with my exercises.
I am just in so much pain. I have tried backing off on my pain meds (narcotics) but there is just no way. I can't sleep at night and feel like a zombie at times during the day. At this rate I'll never be able to drive.
Anyone else having this issue with pain? I do ice frequently too.
My biggest worry is that I will never be able to get off these narcotics.

"Hi, as a few of you are aware I've had nothing but problems from the word go .. I'm now close to 11mths post op and unfortunately the inections for my hip bursitis haven't worked. 
I've just only been reading up on them and it did mention that if one leg was only a fraction shorter than the other that it may also cause one.  So it got me thinking that maybe there's just a cm or less difference in my leg lengths now (so can't wait for the other knee to be done) and was wondering if anyone that has had just the one TKR has ever noticed this.
I have been standing as straight as I can and I do feel as if maybe there is the slightest of difference but not really sure .. if I remember will ask physio tonight and also ask surgeon when I see him in a couple of weeks.

"I have chronic lower back pain due to many things but now it's my knees. I ended up having my knees scoped,thinking it was a bad idea,now it's worse. I have had injections,last a couple days.I now wake up crying because the pain is unbearable. It is in both but mostly my left knee.I never injured them. Why I had them scoped is because when I walked or bend the knee,you can hear the grinding,opping,.I was told I had alot of cartridge build up along with arthritis.They needed to scrap all that away. This started out that the pain came and went but now it's there all the time. It's so much worse at night,it seems anyway because now it's waking me up,and I cry so hard. Don't know what to do? No more injections, don't work,I don't want them scoped again because I feel this is why it's worse.Anyone having this problem? Oh and sometimes I get swelling on side of knee cap, Angles swell only couple times but I am worried.this pain takes my breath away.

I can hardly walk and feel that maybe one size or (six sizes) do not fit everybody. Maybe I needed a bespoke prosthetic not one off the shelf!

Ive found this the most painful of all exersises since the op 9 wks ago and the pain is next to knee on the outside of leg going down to the ankle. I also have pain in my shin which she says isnt normal. I still cant sleep as the pain is worse at night. My Dr gave me amitroptiline to try to help me sleep but its not working.

"Hi. I'm 15 weeks post op from total knee replacement. I'm 41, with brittle bones disease which has left me multiple fractures throughout my life. One of which left my left knee severely disfigured with eventually osteoarthritis. Bone on bone.
Had my total knee replacement 15 weeks ago at stanmore royal orthopadic hospital London.
I had problems with bending to begin with. Now I have bet the orthopedics expectation and have a bend of 105 instead of the predicted 90.
However today I woke up with swelling on the inside of the knee cap and below, it is painful. I have a painful grinding in it when I straighten and bend it. The grinding can be felt if you put your hand on my knee.
Any ideas please as to what it could be?. Am I worrying for nothing?
Please any advice would be really appreciated.
Thank you to anyone who replies

"Hi all.  I am 6 weeks post-op with a partial knee replacement & a Total knee replacement ( was supposed to have 2 partials, but we all know how best laid plans go!).  I'm doing really well I've been told, 116 & 115 respectively.  Out patient PT 3days a week and I always feel better when I leave.    I have been trying to not take the oxcycodone so much, but after 2days with only taking Tylenol I was miserable, sleeping became almost impossible and my skin around my incisions (more so on the TKR) was so hyper-sensitive that ANYTHING touching skin there was unbearable!  I finally last night took a Percocet before bed and did indeed sleep!  I'm wondering if still needing the pain meds are normal at this point?  I was so concerned about becoming dependent, but I just can't handle this pain with Tylenol alone!  I can go more than 6 hours between, and could prob get by at this point with taking before bed and PT.  wondering how everyone else is managing?  Thanks so much for any input you guys have!  Robin.

This has become worse this month
in addition descending and climbing stairs has this month become very painful, like before the surgery.  
In short had i not had surgery in january my present day complaints would have led me to a surgeon.  He has not been very responsive; says it will improve... too soon

"I'm housebound at the moment due to a knee flare-up: soft tissue inflammation and pain. It's been over two weeks so far with no sign of improvement.
The underlying issue is patellar maltracking (kneecap off-centre). The solution is to build up the quadriceps but exercise is not an option when it's at its worst, as now.
In fact I'm really struggling to get my activity level low enough to let it heal. My GP said ""a week in bed"" but I live alone and that's impossible. I can't take NSAIDs orally due to a stomach ulcer but I do use ibuprofen gel, as well as ice packs.
What else can I do? Should I be using heat treatment instead of cold (or as well as)? Any other advice? I'm really frustrated, it's extremely inconvenient work-wise, I'll be very grateful for any help.

This year in january i was marching through town like i was fixated with getting slim and lean when i lost my blance and my right leg kinda twisted and immediately my leg felt like it was the size of an elephant and could hardly step on it and felt like all my blood had gone from my body into that leg
Six months my life is ffels like over, Ive seen 6 DIFFERENT pysiothreapists none no really what is the matter, but it started with the right leg feeling so heavy if i walked too far, almost as if i was going to have to drag it and it just didnt want to walk
Another symptom is severe tingling and burning in both legs
its became different and so bad that even if im watching Tv,lying down my pain is unbearable
guys and gals im in sheer agony from doing NOTHING,feels like someones pounding my bones and muscles with about 100 hammers
Its agony and the legs are so stiff when walking that just walking 20 feet is short of a miracle, does anyone know what is wrong with me? had anyone PLEASE help me or an angel out there, im willing to try ANYTHING
I just dont want to be in pain again and want my legs to walk without wanting to stop

"Hi guys and gals. Just thought I'd give you an update after seeing my gp yesterday
I mentioned to him about stem cell therald, but unfortunately it's not available here
on the nhs here in the uk and probably won't be for a good few years yet. So that's
out the window (unless I won the lottery and can pay privately).So after a good chat
chat with him we've decided to jig my medication about as as we all know our
bodies get immune to things after a length of time. So he's taken me of my
amatryptatine on a night and replaced it with diazaapm,and also added citalopram
but has left the rest of my meds the same that being morphine tablets,
gabapentin 900mg 3x daily, ,fentanyl patches 50mcg to be worn for 3 days
then change and wear for another 3 days and so on, also lidocaine patches
that I wear every night. All thsee medication also help with my back and shoulder
problems. Previous xrays,scans, mri have indicated that I have wear and tear in
my knees and also the early onset of arthritis due to all the ops that I've had.
I think they use this wear and tear as don't really know for sure. It's being on going
now like I've said in previous messages since I was 18,now 42,so as u can
imagine I'm rather fed up to say the least. However my gp is now booked me
in for blood tests to see if I have fibromyalgia as I'm showing more and more
symptoms for it. So will keep u all posted . Sorry For the rather long post.

"I was diagnosed 4 years ago with OA in one knee as a result of a bad fall,  followed by a second similar fall [didn't look where I was going!!] and a few months later after an Xray the OA was revealed. Up until now it has not been a problem but I do find my knee is becoming  increasingly stiff and 'grates' on occasion.  I don't think it is causing me to limp - yet - but I often have to consciously work at preventing that.
I would like to know does this mean the arthritis is deteriorating and is it always inevitable that it will do so? I am 74 and am of normal weight. I walk daily and garden as much as the weather will allow.
 I don't want to have surgery if it can be avoided, what can I do to help myself?

"4 weeks out. Joe do you position your leg when going to sleep at night? I used to use a body pillow that I positioned my leg on from hip to toe. I realized that that made the leg straightening more difficult because the knee was slightly bent all night. Now that I've improved my pain and anti-inflammatory management, I'm almost able to sleep with my leg flat on the bed, but it still is too painful to go to sleep that way. I've tried lying on my side using the pillow between my legs, but that fires up the bursitis in my hip. I've tried the frog position for the leg, but that still is uncomfortable. So now it seems I'm back to the pillow.
What do you do with your leg when you lie down to sleep at night?

Well l have to praisw some of you and apologise for not listening how dient and much harder the knee replacement was comopaired to the hip replacement.
The pain was unvearable for 3 to 4 days but l am home now and its still really sore but getting there. I find it really hard sitting on a chair. The brusing is starting to come out now and lying on the couch is my comfortable place. Getting on and off the couch is the hard part. I can walk about the house without using my sticks now. But its still very sore and it was a lot worse than my hips. I get my staples out on tuesday and the wound looks clean and neat but itchy as anything. But its done now. And l am not rushing to get the other one done. Lol
But thanks for the advice you were right.

"Hi, i will cut right into the story. I am 23 years old and i had a partial acl injury 9 months ago which my doctor decided not to handle with a surgery but instead told me to work out and strenghten my leg muscles and that it should be alright. I worked out for 3 months and got back to basketball, the sport i love the most, it's my passion and a part of my identity. It was working well for i'd say month and a half and then i had 2 injuries in less than a month and i underwent arthroscopy on my right knee.
After the surgery doc said that he had to remove most of my medial meniscus and that my ACL is now completely torn. I feel good now, i could ride a bike like a week after arthroscopy, i have no problem walking but i am still to test my knee on activites like running or something like that. My question is, could i make a comeback to sports like basketball and tennis, two sports i play the most but that are really not easy on the knee. If i, let's say go for a ACL reconstruction surgery and repair, could i play basketball, not until i am old, but till, let's say, my 30-35 years. Doc said that because of my lack of meniscus my knee is using up faster and that i could some day need a knee replacement.
So, what would you suggest there. I am about to meet with another doctor, but i just can't stop thinking about it and that i could really live a life without my favourite sports, i think that would change me as a person, to bring out something that brought and was bringing so much joy to much life.

"I am now 4 weeks post TKR. My recovery has been going pretty well overall. Flexion is around 115 and extension 1-2. I am riding the bike daily with zero resistance. I remember someone (Chico I think) posting on here about focusing on endurance before strength, which is what I've been doing. Last week my physical TERRORIST pushed a little too hard, adding more weight to my exercises than I was comfortable with. The next day my leg was sore and weak from groin to shin. I have a great deal of swelling behind my knee and my extension is now worse than before (this happened 4 days ago). I'm trying to alternate heat and ice and attempting to continue to do straightening exercises but it has become unbearable to hold the stretch. I am saddened by the backwards progress and wondering if this has happened with anyone else?

I'm new and very very fed up
I'm 25 years old and had knee problems for a few years now, I remain undiagnosed
I'm in pain alot of the time with my knees and hips, I've just learnt to deal with it but then sometimes the pain can get very severe
My left knee makes an awful grinding noise, both knees crack alot, when I'm walking they suddenly give way which is getting more and more frequent
If i sit still for a certain amount of time, my knees crack with every step for the first few steps, can become very stiff if still for too long aswell and takes a while to shake off
They can become hot too touch and swell up if I do too much and by too much I mean just normal weekend at work
I've been doctors a rediculous amount of times, i was referred to orthotics, they said i had flat feet, knock knee when weight bearing and generalised joint laxity, had specially made insoles to help combat me walking on the outside of my foot... didnt work
I need further help diagnosis, above conditions shouldn't cause the amount of pain and problems I'm in, doctors just continually fob me off, they've put me on cocodamol and naproxen
Can anyone help with further diagnosis or ideas of what it could be please?

This physical therapist is the first one that has gone over my health history and let me know because of my osteoporosis my low Vitamin-D level and a few other things this is the problem why I may not get past 90% even after the second surgery. I feel that I wasted the last 8 weeks at this other physical therapist office and got nowhere I'm a bit frustrated. I'm 57 years old I can be out of work for up to one year so by next June I need to be back to work I sure hope and pray I can get to at least 90% is anyone else having any problems like this I know we're all different.FEELING DOWN

"I thought it might be interesting to see what the different techniques are currently around the World and within each Country. If you reply please can you state which Country you are in.
So here in Essex in the UK my surgeon's approach was:-
A spinal anaesthetic with a level of sedation of my choice - which was sleep, at least till near the end ! Interesting to wake up and hear them talking about closing up the wound and golf, a conversation I joined in. I believe he also injects the joint with something like the dental numbing drug Lidocaine. So it took under two hours and I was wheeled back to the ward after an X-ray. I felt great but slightly unnerved by being paralysed from the waist down. This gradually went away in the next couple of hours. No catheter so a bit of temporary loss of bladder control but a small price to pay. There must have been some sort of ""high"" drug in the mix because that night I got no sleep as I was so euphoric about getting through the op and had no pain. I was kept in for a further two days till I could get down stairs on crutches. Pain management was basically, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen and Cocodeine taken together every four or maybe six hours. Pain was never unbearable, just uncomfortable with some loss of sleep at night at first but not too drastic.

I do have an apt for a pain clinic but not for 19 days. Hopefully I can hang in there. I'm reading people's posts on here about how much they are doing after 5 weeks.

"I had a tkr in November 2014 and for the first year it was fine.  From November last year I started with pain. Had my first year check, x ray was fine so had a bone scan which showed degeneration of knees, shoulders and hips.  Now the pain has got worse, my knee hurts  and seems to be more swollen. I also have pain in my groin going down the front and side of the leg.  Is this pain radiating from my knee or something else, maybe my hip? The consultant suggested the new knee might be loosening but as the xray did not show anything I am waiting to go back in November.  I have an appointment at Docs next week to ask for a referral back to hospital or another xray to see what the problem is.  Any ideas as to whether this is likely to be the knee loosening or something else? I really don't fancy having to go through a revision if it is but I am starting to hobble now.

"I'm 4 weeks out and have a ways to go with straightening my leg (right now it's still about -3), while my flexion is OK (110) and somewhat improving.  I keep reading about not letting scar tissue setttle in, and I don't understand what that means.  Will there be a point when I won't be able to progress any more because the scar tissue has taken up permant residency?  If so, any idea when that will be?  I don' have any more PT sessions set up, but think I should. And I feel like I'm exercising enough because I'm exhausted at the end of the day, to the point of feel somewhat queasy after i've finished them.   But I will push frther if I'm under some sort of time clock..

"On May 30, 2016, I had a fall resulting in a dislocated knee. When I fell I heard a popping sound and when I hit the ground, I fainted. When I finally came to, my mom told me that I had dislocated my knee and she relocated it. She drove me to the ER and they were in the process of giving me an xray when, all I did was turn my leg slightly to the right and my knee dislocated again. Dr. sedated me to relocate it. They ran a number of tests and found that I had a slightly damaged artery in the back of my leg. They put me in a locked brace and admitted me for observation. When the ok was given, I was able to go home with my brace on, still locked. It stayed locked for the next two weeks. I went for a follow up with my doctor, he told me I had torn my ACL, MCL, and two tears in my meniscus. Also at this time, I discovered that my knee had become stiff from it being locked in place for two weeks. I had to go to PT to get my ROM back. It took nearly 2 months to get my flexion to 100. No matter how hard I tried I could not get it passed that. I just had surgery on the 19th of August and I realize I'm still in the early stages of recovery but with all that happened before surgery, I feel so discouraged and depressed. Most of all I feel so scared that I may not be able to get my full flexion back. On top of that, I'm scared of experiencing the pain of a dislocation again, after it just happened so easily in the ER. I want to push myself to have a successful recovery but I feel I am my own worst enemy because of my fears. I just really need someone who's had a similar experience to offer me some encouragement. This is the lowest I've ever been in my life.

"Earlier when I was in bed I bent my knee and tried to lay on my side but all of a sudden my leg (the area near my kneecap and alll around that area) was swelling with pain. Whenever I tried to straighten it out, and when I leaned forward it would feel like someone was pulling on the insides of my leg. And when I moved it, it felt ""squeaky"" or rubber-ish like it was rubbing up against something.
My father noted that while it was happening my toes were unintentionally straightened out and tense.
We finally had to straighten my leg out with force and it made a loud popping noise. My father who was holding my foot to help me noted that he felt the large pop and my leg jerked forward.
I could bend it fine after that but it still hurts to walk on and feels very light. My mother says that it's just ""growing pains"" but we honestly had to use brute force to straighten my leg out.
My father says that I may have to get a leg brace for it.
It's now a couple hours later and I'm supposed to sleep but everytime I move my leg it aches and pops loudly. I am very concered because I am a dancer and gymnast and I fear that the pain won't go away.
Do any of your know what's happening and/or how I can make it hurt less?

"Hi family,
I am 13 weeks post-op TKR today and 6 weeks post-op MUA. I am getting down... I had a couple fairly good days and now the past 3 days have been awful. My knee feels like a brick and upon trying to bend and straighten back out, I have such pain underneath my kneecap. Maybe I'm doing too much? Sunday and yesterday I did do alot of walking. I have also yet to sleep through the night. Is this normal? My last visit, my surgeon gave me a cortisone shot to try and help with the pain underneath the kneecap. It hasn't helped. It caused me to feel like I had restless leg syndrome throughout my whole body which in turn he told me to take Benadryl for. I spoke with him this morning and he prescribed somethig for pain along with Ambien to help me sleep. He has told me to take 1 Ambien every night at 10;30pm. Has anyone else experienced this? I am still icing and elevating. Do you think heat would help as well?Currently I am at a minus 2 or 3 in extension and with flexion yesterday I was 90 on my own by sitting on the table and trying to bend it as much as I could, then doing wall slides I measured at 102.
Thank you in advance for any responses!
Take care. This journey has been an awful rollercoaster ride.

Now my knee is starting to give out, it doesn't exactly hurt to walk on it, but it does hurt to bend it. It also feels like something is trying to block me from bending it. The pain on a scale of 1 - 10 is about a 3. I scheduled a doctors appointment today, but have I caused lasting damage to my knee by not seeking medical attention immediately? How serious is my condition and should I be worried. Thank you for your time!

"Hi all,
My names phill I'm new here but I don't know where else to turn.
A year and a half ago I had accident in work I fell of the bottom runs of Tower scaffolding with a lead roll on my shoulder. I dislocated my patella, shered a price of bone and tore my Mcl.
Since doing this I have had key hole surgery and the surgeon removed a bone fragment from my knee and preformed a chondroplasrty.
A Yeah and a half later my knee still hasent gotten any better I can jump, kick or run. Walking up.the stairs is painful and due to over compensation my other knee is now showing signs of similar pain.
My referral to.the NHS basically said there is nothing they can do and will not preform any other surgery as it could make the knee worse and will not preform a knee replacement as I'm only 26.
This is seriously affecting my life. I can't play sports daily activities hurt, I struggle with pain in my job, I can't train legs in the gym and I envision that things are only going to get worse.
Where do I go from here? What can I do?

Three weeks exactly after surgery, pain and stiffness are still a challenge, so I thought I'd try the masseuse but wanted to check with group yo see if anyone had experience with this--whether massage might have long-term benefits and not just transitory relief.

I have had one TKR and have nothing but problems (mine was due by being run over by a truck) I'm 10mths post op have now had a bursitis on my hip for 4mths and am having a 2nd ultrasound guided booster injection on Monday for it.  Have just found out today that I have a bursitis in the muscle surrounding my TKR .. I had a fall full on my operated knee on day 8 after surgery.  Xray came back all was clear but I personally thought something wasn't right with my knee .. even tho I had no idea what my knee would feel like.  Dr says that it has shown up more and the pain associated with it has been so intense since I stopped taking narcotics.  He also believes that it happened with my fall as I've always complained about it but not to this extent.  So glad I'm off the narcotics as I fully want them out of my system b4 my next TKR so the drugs will work better.  Dr says that he has only ever seen a bursitis on a TKR once b4, has anyone else suffered with this .. this has been one horrendous experience .. hoping the next one flies by without issues!

Does anyone suffer from stinging in their knee post tkr? If I jolt my knee just a little it causes pain which I expect and stinging. The stinging is worse than the pain. It makes my eyes water. Is this normal?

"Background: I have been suffering for knee pain for two years and was barely able to leave the house. I get a stabbing pain in the front of both knees when walking. It also becomes unbearably painful at night.
Last year I was sent for an MRI & X-ray which showed nothing.
In February, I was finally sent to a physiotherapist. Her exercises helped as I’ve slowly built up the walking I can do to 25 minutes before it gets painful.
This week I was referred to a physiotherapist who specializes in knee pain. He says I have over sensitive nerves and patellofemoral pain (when the knee joint doesn’t align properly and causes pain).  
He advises to pace myself to gradually increase the amount of walking I do. 
 My question: Is this condition aggravated by long car journeys? I’ve looked on the Internet but have found mixed opinions. I have got a family event that is a 3 hour journey (I will be going as a passenger). It’s the first time I’ve done such a journey in over a year (as I found car trips to be too painful in the past). 
Is it worth attempting it or should I leave it? 
I did ask the physiotherapist, but his answer was a bit vague. He just said if you have to go, then you have to go, but just take lots of breaks. 
But as I am finally making progress, I don’t want to jeopardize it with something that might be too much!

"Hi,
i found this forum 10 months ago after my bilateral tkr's and like most of us, found it a godsend, with great advice, empathy and sympathy when I needed it.  I can't express how grateful I am for helping me get through and see a light at the ene of a sometimes dark tunnel.  I like reading what's been written, compare notes and give advice.  I am not an expert.  I'm not medically trained, I'm just overwhelmed by the journey and sometimes have to pat myself on the back for getting through this ordeal.  As you know, not been easy for any of us but at least we knew we could talk to each other here and share our stories.  This is turning out a bit long winded but I've recently discovered there has been some underhanded bullying going on in this forum, in the form of "" personal"" messaging, where another patient, who I only know through this forum, has been bullied to the point, she no longer gives advice or feels she can join in on any discussions.  How sad it has come to this.  I'm not going to mention names because your conscience will let you know who You are,   I do think you should feel ashamed.  We are none "" holier than thou"" and all in pretty much the same boat.  So what if some improve quicker and some swear that icing helps or that we've had more operations so should know everything so much better than other mere mortals on here.  We are all here for the same reason, advice and saving our sanity, when we think we're the only one going through this.  What right has someone got to rubbish the advice and take the cowardly way and send what they think in a private message.  What are we, spiteful teenagers??  It just makes me sad to hear this kind of thing.  it is a help "" forum"" after all.  Letting everyone have their point of view.  So children, be nice hey.  
thanks for listening......

"I'm 55 and just had a left tkr. I wouldn't wish this on my enemy and will be extra careful to avoid having a premature revision. This is the most painful, debilitating and miserable surgery ever. I'm am now 3 weeks post op and discovered a key to instantaneous decrease in pain, the bike. Although excruciatingly painful, home PT has gotten me to 117 degrees of flexion. There is no easy way out, you have to allow them to push u and u push yourself safely.I decided to drive myself to the gym and begin the recliner bike, wow! Although you must warm up, I've done it 2 days In a row safely and slowly, and did 15 minutes working my way up to level 12. The difference is day and night. While there is stiffness and discomfort, I'm it taking Oxycodone except at bedtime.

"Well, its been a strange old week....had my diagnosis of premature loosening of my right TKR last Monday (17 months post-op) and the need for Revision Surgery, Ive been all over the place - mood swings, bursting into tears all the time....its almost felt like its happening to someone else and Im an outsider....but I think Im geting a grip on it now, its got to happen, no point burying my head in the sand - time to pull up my Big Girl Pants and deal with it! Ive just had a lovely chat with one of the Ortho Registrars - she phoned me at home to see how I was getting on -   and I had a good meeting with my GP yesterday so Ive got the support from the medics....and the GOOD NEWS? My blood tests have come back and all the Inflammatory markers are within relatively normal limits. Ive still got to go in for aspiration of the joint, but it looks like NO INFECTION!!! SO -  trying to grasp a little bit of hope from the situation, at least it looks like a one-stage surgery, rather than the 2-stage it would need for an infected joint. 
Just waiting now for a date for the aspiration, and Im going on holidays in 5 weeks, then its back on the old merry-go-round - at least I know the drill now, I suppose......Id better start reading back through some of my posts where Ive been supporting others, see if I can glean a bit of strength and inspiration from them.....

"hi all
I am a week and a half post meniscus surgery. I'm feeling a little better as in im able to walk without crutches but im still having some issues with walking. I will try to explain this the best way possible since tgis is my 1st time ever having to go through this.
Like I said before I am able to walk without crutches but when it comes to walking up and down steps Im having some issues because when im taking a step to put pressure on my knee it feels like my knee is going to shift to the side and it (my knee) feels very unstable.
Another issue I have is when walking up or down an incline such as a handicap ramp my knee feels like its going to slide off to the left.
Lastly, I am still having a clicking sound/feeling when walking. Again, I dont know if this is normal or not but im just afraid that something is still wrong. I drive truck for a living and I really cant afford to screw this up more.
If anyone has gone through this or has had these same issues please let me know what your findings were thanks.

I do have bruising and swelling up high on the thigh but pain is minimal and manageable with the Vicodin.

"I had bilateral knee replacement surgery June 27th. I decided on bilateral as my legs got extremely deformed and bowed in the past 12 years. Now they are straight, and I have 120 degree flexion, and full extension. I'm still having a challenge with managing pain with meds, and per doc's advice decreased to taking 5 mg oxycodone  3 to 4 times throughout 24 hours. I also started taking lorazepam for sleep as waking up every 2-3 hours for past 5 weeks was a drag. I still wake up a couple of times per night. I'm icing several times per day, and night when I wake up. I'm meeting with my orthopedist this week and he wants to take me off all narcotics and just take Advil. I'm not ready for that. How do I convince him that I still need stronger pain meds? My early evenings are the worst, and it seems every day I'm brought to tears with discomfort with deep inner ache not only in my knees, but also radiating down my legs and arches, and lower back.  I keep on wondering if I have radiating pain due to the fact that my legs were straightened and now my body has to compensate for this new straight leg gait. My lower back hurts also after some walking. My activity is limited to getting around the house including stairs, walking 1 to 2 hours per day running errands, 10 min on stationary bike and my PT exercises. Is that too much? I'm told by my PT that I should not be walking much - but how much is too much? Should I not be running any errands? I need to get out to not get depressed. And how do you build up your strength? My right knee is way stiffer and painful than right knee. When does one get back to more routine and normal existence? I have not gone back to work yet. I know that recovery is very individual for everyone. When can I expect some type of breakthrough, and get through a day without any pain? Anyone with bilateral knee experience out there that can shed some light on my dilemma? Thanks!

"Hi guys! I'm gonna include a fair amount of detail so you get the full picture.
I had a total knee replacement nearing the end of October (23 weeks ago) to get rid of a tumour on my knee. I was diagnosed with high grade osteosarcoma - a primary bone cancer that occurs mostly in teenagers - a couple days after my 19th birthday. 4 months prior to this, I was very active with sports, parkour and freerunning being a huge hobby and planning to initiate boxing and skydiving as ones too. This is when the pain started and months later, the tumour had developed into a huge painful ball, weakening the knee. I had a biopsy done to test for a cancer, which served to fracture the knee and put my right leg in a cast for more than 3 months pre-surgery while having chemotherapy, so as to not being able to use the knee at all. I had by then lost at least 15kg.
The knee was unusually painful after surgery; I was taken into intensive care and remained on a morphine pump for a couple weeks. I don't understand why it was so painful. I've always known myself as pain tolerant. I used to win most fights with bigger guys (having loved to fight as a kid and teen), not because I was good at fighting but because I could take too many hits and everyone knew. The biggest injections don't make me flinch - I could do it myself. Hell! I'd bet I'd be able to bite a finger off if the situation presented itself. The pain meant I was progressing slower with physiotherapy. Most people would achieve a 90° flexion before leaving the hospital a week or two later, but I couldn't bend it to 90 until months afterwards. This was partly because my leg was locked straight in the cast for months before surgery. Regular high strength chemotherapy after surgery also meant I was completely bedridden in hospital for long periods and was unable to perform daily activities or participate in very much physiotherapy.
Here I am now, 5 months post-op and closing in on the end of chemo treatment, able to do very little with my leg. I've been exercising the leg a LOT over the last couple months, as my chemo is now less intense. I still use two crutches to get around. I can walk very slowly without them, but need to make sure to keep the right leg locked straight when leaning on it, as I haven't yet developed strength enough to hold myself on an even slightly bent right knee; it would reflex and lock straight or I'd just fall. I easily bend the knee to 100° and it takes a fair bit of effort to take it to 115° but beyond that is impossibly painful; I just can't do it; I'm not sure if it would even go much more. My other knee is very flexible - I can sit on the leg, bent. I can't also, from a standing position lift my leg back too much. What really bothers me, however, is the fact that I can't lift my foot at all. From a sitting position, I can move it forward a few centimetres, but that's about all. If I'm standing, I can, again, move it forward a small amount, but aside from that, nothing. When lying down, the leg won't raise from the surface, not slightly.
I love cars and driving is a huge deal to me. My poor motor skills with the knee means I can't drive now (except with adapted controls). I just can't wait to be able to lift my leg straight, but the doctor said there's a chance I won't be able to, and that I'm unlikely to ever be able to kick a football again or jog, but that walking with a limp is the limit of my rehab. What's more, I'm awaiting 5-6 weeks of radiotherapy on the knee after chemo's over, which will prove to stiffen the knee and damage even more tissues.
Why am I progressing so slow? Why is it that my recovery's completely south? I was told before the operation that I'd be able to run again within 6 months. That doesn't look likely. I'm not talking about aiming to jump from the second storey like I was aiming for with parkour before my tumour appeared. I'm not talking about starting boxing classes. I'm not even taking about continuing to run as a hobby, but why was I told it's unlikely that I walk again without a limp, and why is it taking so damn long?
Thanks for any replies.

"Hi 
I've been going for a little while and thought I would update you on my progress and frustrations starting from my 1st TKR on March 2015 at 48yrs old after waiting 10yrs as my Surgeon advised me when diagnosed over 10yrs ago that I was young and it would be better to wait it out as long as possibly. 
The TKR last year was a night mare for me as I posted last year server bruising all the way down my leg and huge swelling for a long time, a bend of only 38degrees, got to 50degress after 4months well I had the MUA which was done late June 2015 with no better outcome I continued to do PT twice a week including Hydro pool work as well as my own exercising at home and after 14months and only getting to 75degrees a decision was made to do revision surgery. I have a very highly regarded Surgeon in this field but neither the less I got a second opinion that ended up confirming my Surgeons thoughts a TKR was required. The X-rays showed that the TKR looked good in the XRay and positioned well and it had to be something else stopping my bend.. 
Well on June 27th 2016 I had the revision done and felt really good after surgery not much pain but the usual stiffiness and swelling my surgeon said that he removed a lot of scar tissue during the procedure that had developed and I managed to get a 55degree bend couple of days later which after 38degrees last year I was over the moon with tears of joy. 
Started PT only to have a problem within the next 48hrs with excess bleeding that went on for 2 weeks and also got a mild staff infection on the outside of the wound my tears of joy went to tears of frustration. This limited my PT and stopped for 4 days but then was back into it I worked harder in those sessions then most doing 2 sets of everything and sets of 20 and only slow progress was seen got to 65degrees then a lot of mobilisation work was done by the Physio pushing the leg back controlled with also massaging and I got to 75degree and was discharged from hospital after 4 weeks 2 weeks longer than anticipated but that's all the bend ever got to with the Physio pushing 75degrees whilst others were well past 90..
I went back to the surgeon after a week of being discharged so was just under 6 weeks from the operation and he was concerned and has given me 2 weeks to get better movement and that PT would focus more agresively in attacking the bend and I'm to go to hydro pool every day focussing on my bend and if the bend doesn't improve sufficiently after 2 weeks when I go back to seeing him I'm to go in for MUA which didn't work last year after my TKR.
The surgeon is very concern of scar tissue building again and after the first week from seeing him I've gone backwards again even more to 65degree and I do the exercises and also hydro pool every day I'm not sure what's going on??? 
But I do know the suffering I had from the first TKR last year and quality of life changing only having a bend of 75degree and constant swelling and stiffness every day after work and I'm concerned that's where I'm heading again??? This time it's not as swollen but still have the stiffness and getting worse but I also feel the knee cap moving around when I walk or move the leg around and it's an unpleasant and unnatural feeling which I didn't have last year.
I'm now lost for words why is this happening????
Is it safe to assume that if I can not get a bend better than last time of 75degrees it's not worth doing it a 3rd time? Is there anyone that has experience that the revision TKR didn't work and left with a bend less than 90degree and just had to live with it?
Thanks and apologies for the long message.

"This is my second TKR I am at the 4 1/2 week mark on the second I am 2 1/2 months out on the first. I can say that they're almost identical in recovery. I am able to be on an exercise bike indoors at this time for short periods of time. We are doing some light weights and still extreme bending with the therapist. I walk into the The physical therapist with the 110° extension and leave with 122. The first month the pain management is critical for me anyway in order to stay on top of my physical therapy and stay rigorous with bending. The doctors these days are very skittish about writing pain meds but what they don't also understand is in a put us behind in our recovery. For me it took an entire eight weeks before I was able to sleep entirely through the night on all sides.I am 46 years old and very active skiier and fly fisherman at the eight week mark I was able to wait in the river and ride my bike up and down somewhat steep and rocky terrain. The biggest thing is keep bending and don't give up on physical therapy and take the meds if you need them to stay on top of your PT. I feel like if there was snow now I could be skiing on my right knee and come Thanksgiving I'll be ready to go.????

"Hi, I'm Andrew and I'm only 13 but for as long as I can remember, ever since I was a baby I would get this weird ache in my knee cap. It isn't constant, it only lasts around an hour or so and then disappears and It might happen two days in a row or I might not get it for a month.
The best way I could describe it is like a mix between a headache and the weird feeling you get when you hit your funny bone (other people have described a burning sensation and I can kind of see where they are coming from), concentrated to what feels like just beneath the knee cap. My mom used to pass it off as ""growing pains"" but I know better as it only occurs in my right knee. It isn't enough to make me unable to walk, just awkward and uncomfortable. What could this be?

"Since my TKR eleven days ago my compression stockings have been tight especially on the operated knee. They were remeasured in hospital and are the correct size. On the swollen knee the top rolls over and digs a band into the knee making it more uncomfortable than it already is. I have just taken them off for half an hour and it's bliss.There is a deep mark round my keg, just under the knee, where the stocking was digging in. Surely this is not good for circulation.
Has anyone else had this problem? I have to keep them on for over four weeks more yet.

"I had a TKR to my left knee last Wednesday July 27th and so far so good. I had the right knee replaced three years ago virtually to the day and have been so pleased with the outcome.
What I had completely forgotten about was the inability to sleep at night..hence me writing this at some unearthly hour! Fortunately I do have a couple of sleeps in the day particularly after my exercise sessions.
Does anyone out there have any tips for a more restful nights sleep please?

"Hello everyone. I'm sorry to be a bore as i keep coming here with all different complaints. The truth is i have all kinds of pain since my left TKR which was 4 months ago. I need to know if any one is going through something similar. I have been having left hip, groin, back, neck, jaw muscle pain for several weeks now. Started about six weeks ago. The left thigh muscle also feels heavy and painful. My rheumy and the surgeon have ruled out hip arhtritis. It seems my whole left side is just cramping up continaully and it's difficult to go on. Please anyone is this normal.

"To all of you that's willing to hear my
story I want to say God Bless you all.
When I was 15 years old riding my motorcycle thru the small town i was raised in I was broadsided by a car that run a stop sign. Not seeing it coming gave me no chance to get my right leg out of the way. The bumpers of cars were solid steel back then and my leg was crushed between the motor of the motorcycle and the steel bumper.
This changed my left for ever and I went thru several operations from having steel plates installed, bone grafts from my hip installed to help my leg bone heal, to having a small piece of the small leg bone cut off because it would heal faster pushing my larger bore away so it would not heal. After all these operations I was told to never break my leg again and for over twenty five years I took care of my right leg until one evening September 2013 while flying a drone I accidentally stepped into a hole and my right leg broke in the place that had always had such a hard time to heal back when I was younger.
The trauma surgeon on call knew he was in for a different operation because my bone came thru the skin tearing the skin side to side which was not normal and my leg had screws left in it where when the orthopedics tried to remove them when I was younger but they broke off. Now this surgeon was going to need to locate these screws and remove them before he could install a steel rod down the middle of my leg. He had to talk everything over with his team of surgeons and waited until the next day before performing the surgery. Six weeks later I found out my skin would not heal due to all the scar tissue from all the past surgeries when I was younger. Also I had developed a staff infection from something inside the hospital. A plastic surgeon had to be called in along with a infections disease doctor. Another surgery was required to remove the badly scared skin and a six inch by one and a half inch piece of skin from my upper right thigh had to be removed and placed over my shin where the skin was removed because it would not heal back.
Two weeks later I left the hospital and now almost three years later my right leg is doing ok. Other than my leg looking very weird and my ankle hurting in the mornings which is something that I've dealed with since I was fifteen years old I was doing ok.
The problem I have now is since I always have had to rely on my left leg to do things like jump off of and land back on, to kicking a football or using a shovel to plant a garden I've found out that I have worn my meniscus out in my left knee.
This I had been told years ago by a orthopedics doctor that preformed a scope of my left knee. He had to remove all my meniscus during a scope where he thought that only a torn piece needed removing.
He told me my knee was now bone on bone and I needed a knee replacement but at my age 42 no insurance company would pay it. He said that he could only offer me celabrex and pain medication. I knew then that my life as I knew it along with my career was at stake.
I continued to work but it was noticeable by any employer I worked for. Never could I mention that my left knee was worn out or I never would have got any job. But still they would always see I had a problem because I no longer could keep up with other workers hired to do the same job. Usually after six months to a year I would be let go and told I was being laid off because of lack of work. But I knew the real reason and understood the employers could not come out and say the truth about why I was being laid off.
I went from job to job but finally realized that I had to have a TKR if I ever wanted to not be in so much pain.
So after getting laid off May 2015 I decided to start trying to get some government help and to finally have my knee replaced.
Well I can say that getting any help from our government after working for over twenty five years and paying into the system has proved to me the system is not set up to help the working man. I was trying to get help after breaking my leg in 2013 but once my leg healed up I thought it was best to try to work and stop the SSD process. So I went back to work and that same week the SSD called asking me about my case. I explained to the lady that I really did not want to go on disability because I had two children that were needing to go to college and I needed to work if I could to help them. But I also said that if I found out that I could not do the work because of my knee I would be calling back. That if they got a call again from me that I had proven to myself that I needed a knee replacement and I was going to need some help.
Well it's been many many months now and I don't get any help from the government. That has made me look at the system a totally different way. Never did I want to or intended on staying on disability because I need to make more money than what SSD pays. I only needed the help to provide for my family during the I was out getting the operation that would finally stop all the pain I had been dealing with for over ten years. Still I've never seen a penny of help from our government. I've watched people get on disability because they were alcoholics and had never held a regular job in there life. To me the people that make the decision if someone is disabled or not must be paid off or something. Because i know that I'm temporary disabled and with the work restrictions I'm now going to have I need.to go back to school to learn something different so I can return to work.
Now to what I really have a question about.
I had my left knee replaced June 27, 2016.
It's been a little over four weeks and I can't say it's going good because I really don't know if it is or not. It's still swollen around my knee and when I try to bend my leg I can't go past maybe 100°. It feels so tight that I'm afraid to try to force it to bend any further than it will. Forcing it will also hurt very bad and I'm not sure if that pain is my body saying it's time to stop before you hurt something worse or what it's trying to tell me.
I've went on internet sites like this one and read about how different people recover from a TKR and most people are different than others.
I can say that it still throbs but nothing like it did the first two weeks. Also I get a burning under my knee after therapy.
I've tried heat before therapy and ice afterwards but still I can't seem to get the bending back in my leg. Maybe I'm thinking it should be bending more but actually it's where it should be four weeks after surgery.
If anyone can help me understand things better I sure would like to hear different views on what I may be doing wrong or what I can do to help myself get my knee to bend normal again.
Thanks for all your time and help.
Sincerely,
Kenneth Clayton

"It it more likely that my knee will slip out of place when I'm relaxed on the couch or in bed than if I'm at a yoga class or hiking in the mountains for hours and cliff diving.  But you can't tell by looking at it anything is wrong!  It is just very painful and I cannot put any weight on it until I have 'kicked' it back into place!
I first discovered I could kick it back into place and walk fine again after swimming a few minutes of breast stroke.  Now when it slips out I need to hang from a bar and imitate swimming kicks until I feel and hear a small click or clud and then I can walk on it fine with no pain whereas before I couldn't put any weight on it and it was extreamly painful.  
The doctor called it a dislocated Patella and only said to 'strenghen the quads'.  Is this a complete diagnosis?  I already have strong quads so I'm not sure what else I can be doing to prevent the knee from slipping out.  
Thanks in advance!

"Hi everyone,  brief bit of history, I have broken my left patella three times. First time it was just put in a brace, second time a broke my ankle at the same time they wired my knee and put screws in my ankle and third time when the wire snapped, they re-wired it. This was from 2001 to 2005. Recovery was slow. From about 2011 -2013 things were what I would call better, mobility although not perfect was good considering. But from 2013 I started getting pain in my ankle and knee. Over the last three years pain has got worse, and I my knee has been locking. I saw more doctor who said I should sort my ankle out first, so they removed screws last october thinking that was what was causing the pain, but it turns out its actually a bone spur so I am going in next friday for arthroscopy on my ankle to clean out my ankle and remove the spur.  Meanwhile my knee has got worse with locking happening on a daily basis so went back to the doctors. I saw the physio at the hospital today and she wants me to go for an MRI. My knee does not look pleasant, depending on the result will determine whether I have an arthoscopy of my knee or a knew kneecap.  I would just like to know if anyone else has had a new kneecap and how they felt it went? would you do it again, how long did it take to recover?                                                       Sorry a long one for my first post.

I still am having horrible swelling every day making exercises to improve my knee flexion almost impossible. I can only bend it just so much and then the swelling takes over. I can do 10 minutes 3 times a day on my recumbent bike but every time I try to increase the time my leg starts to ache big time. Does anyone still have just 100 degree flexion after a lengthy time? Can I live this way forever? I don't think it will ever bend any further.

when I had my right knee replaced (different surgeon, whom I love & respect, but he moved out of state), he wanted me to  take things slower than I did.    For instance, he insisted that I wait 12 weeks post-op, before I started working my green broke wild mustang.  However, being a open knee surgery veteran I did not take it easy and pushed myself and had a GREAT result.
When I asked the surgeon that did this knee when I could start working my newly acquired green broke wild mustang he said: ""why are you asking me that, when you feel like riding, ride.""  As I said, this surgeon seems to have no empathy nor personality.  He is however, well known for his surgical skills and is considered ""the revision guy"" where I live.  I have refered 2 friends to him that needed their 4th revisions on their knees.  Both of my friends had infected femurs & tibias.  My friend's surgeons that did the 1st replacement and the revisions (different surgeons for primary tka & revision tka's--all of the surgeries were done in different states from where I live) told them that short of amputation, there was nothing that could be done.  They called me and I got them into see my surgeon ""the revision guy"".  My surgeon performed the 4th revision on both of my friends and they had AMAZING results.  My surgeon acted like these type of revisions were absolutely a piece of cake.  I relay these stories, because, this surgeon is a gifted ""cutter"".  However, I know that he will have no advice for me as far as me being discouraged at being 5 weeks post op and still having a ton of pain, still taking narcotics around the clock on a schedule and still LIMPING.  
Folks tell me that I have unreal expectations for myself.  But I do not believe that as I had the same expectations with my right TKA and pushed myself and had a GREAT result.  I am not one to sit on my butt and wait for things to happen.  I believe that I need to be pushing myself to make them happen.
As I said, PT is fine (very easy), I am icing, taking my narcotics (which I HATE).  I just cannot seem to get past the pain and the LIMP!.  My physical therapist wanted me to ""chill and baby my leg this last week"" (I did that as much as working full time, taking care of my parents, 5 horses, donkeys, goats, 6 dogs & cats allow.  It about drove me nuts as I am not one to baby injuries or rehabs).  I have therapy again tomorrow.  My therapist,  said he would evaluate things after my week of ""chilling"" and if things hadn't ""turned around"", he would crank things up and see if we can't ""work ""it"" out of the joint"".  I love & trust my therapist and he has YEARS of experience.  So we shall see what he says.  Personally, I do not believe that ""chilling & babying my knee"" is the right thing for me.  But I did it and will do whatever he thinks is best.  
Are there any knee veterans out there (multiple open surgeries and rehabs) that would have advice other than what I am doing.
Thanks
Personally, I think things need to be ""cranked up"".

I am six days post TKR. I wasn't given instructions on what exercises to do in the first week and wondering if I am doing too much.

"I had a revision TKR almost 4 weeks ago. This was to replace my initial prosthesis from 18 months ago. Although this was perfectly fitted, I could not bend or straighten the leg due to poor ligaments and some scar tissue. I have had ligaments stripped out and now have a long stemmed implant with hinges in place of ligaments. The upside is my leg will now straighten for the first time in years. The bend is another story - it currently sticks at approx 60 degrees.
I am terrified of having to go through any more procedures, I had complications this time and I don't feel up to anything else.
I currently see a physio twice a week and following a detailed exercise plan. I know all the exercises to do and have varying success with these....today though I feel like I have a lump of concrete in it.
I just wanted to know if anyone had struggled with their bend, when/did it improve? What exercise did you find helped the most? (I seem to spend half of my day sliding back and fourth).
After years of limited movement I would be thrilled with 90 degrees so I can ride my bike again.
Appreciate your views x

"Hi Family,
I am 10 weeks post-op with LTKR. I am 3 weeks post-op after manipulation and scar tissue removal. I am still having a very hard time sleeping, bending, walking, etc. Still have quite a bit of scar tissue and can only reach about a 100 bend and that is with the TENS unit on my thigh. I am going to see a Deep Tissue Massage Therapist tomorrow morning. She said she will break up all of my scar tissue and loosen the muscles in my quad/thigh. She did say I will be screaming and crying, so needless to say I am very frightened but I am willing to do anything to get this knee going again. I was only 105 before my actual TKR due to 5 arthoscopies and 2 of them involved a lateral release. I am a 45 year old femaie. 
Has anyone had experience with deep tissue massaging and if so, did it work?
Thanks so much!

"hi all, have to ask is anyone near 4 1/2 months into their total knee replacement and still suffering from pain, swelling and stiffness.  Also my healing process seems to be slow. Last week my bend finally got to 107 degrees and my stretch 4. Three weeks prior to that it was 105/6.  I seem to be getting there, but just wondering if it will get better.  I do everything I'm suppose to 1 to 2x a day, feel like I'm consumed with exercises. Can't take nsaids due to other medical issues. Still take those other meds at a low dosage when I exercise.  Finally started driving this past week, that was hopeful.  I get fearful still of having a accident or falling, I use my stick/ cane only when I go out.  It still hurts like h e double ""L"" when I stretch my knee to as much as I can. I Did hear it can take up to 6 months to a year to fully bend. I just don't know???  I just keep trying to do my best, but some days I go into to that head zone of ""what have I done to myself!"" Phase.  I don't wish this on anyone.  Im so glad I have found all of you, u have been a god send. My people, I believe Are just tired of me not being the old me anymore, boy if they could just be me for one day. At least I keep trying to smile, have a good attitude and oh yea a good sense of humor helps.  Of all things my teeth started to act up with much pain, has taken over a month and a half to get the proper treatment... Finally had that crown and she found a filling that needed to be done, I said just do It!!!    Ahhhhhhh, I've always had good teeth, what's up?!?!?  Ok the novacaine is wearing off now... I'll leave it at that.  Thanks for any feedback and I pray u all feel better soon! ??????????

well this week I stopped the ice and stayed off my leg for 3 days straight only doing the bending and then resting and elevating, within 3 days a dramatic reduction in swelling now Bending comfortably 110 degrees sleeping beautifully it is as if magic at exactly 7 weeks....OK today I went for a walk and had a little swelling but came home elevated and restEd no ice then cook dinner felt great.unbelievable...everything going slowly but there is light at the end of the tunnel...well it's a step in the right direction pardon the pun. and staying positive has really been the key......thanks for all those discussions and 2 bobs worth too folks....

"This is my sixth day after TKR and I always seem to be resting in bed. The pain is so bad that I can't sleep much. Should I be walking around the house more? Just going to the bathroom exhausts and drains me. This morning I had a shower and I couldn't wait to get back into bed. I try all the bed exercises but I am still not able to lift my leg up. I have tried the towel under the knee but the stabbing pain is really bad. 
Unfortunately because of allergies I'm not very good with pain killers.The main tablet makes me very sickly but I have another tablet to help combat that. 
I am very down today and keep crying. I just look at my knee and think 'What an earth have I gone and done?' 
I know I'm being a big softee but reading other peoples experiences on here does help as I know others are suffering too.
It's just that it's so hard to exercise when there is so much pain.

"Hi All. Im now 4 wks into revovery and for some reason yesterday started getting dreadful pain down my thigh and into calf like a torn muscle type pain amd a soreness under the skin on top of my kneecap. I had yet another sleepless night as I cant get comfortable and the pain was worse than its ever been. Also have a lot of clicking going on inside and this is what makes the pain worse in particular place. I cant even lift my leg off the floor tho I was making quite good progress. I feel I have gone back to the beginning.Ive still not been seen by a physio so I dont know if Im doing too much or too little. Im on NSAIDs and paracetemol and cant take anything with codiene in. Is this normal to feel like this? I thought there was some light at the end of the tunnel but now I wish Id never had it done.

The pain is in a specified location on the inside of my knee directly to the left center of my knee cap. Had an me I and the doctor only saw a lot of inflammation and diagnosed an acl sprain. I'm very confused but this and not sure where that diagnosis came from. I also took this picture from my mri that I'd pulled up on my computer which I worried showed a memos all tear.

"Its been just over 3 wks since I had my TKR and I still havent been reffered to physio. Its because I was an outsourced patient and had op done in private hos now my GP is finding it hard to get me physio on NHS. Wondered if any one else had this problem. Im doing the basic excersises that I was shown in hos and lunges etc and I can climb the stairs one at a time and Im on one crutch now but cant sleep. The swellings gone down but still have that tight band feeling around my knee when I walk. My leg straightens well and bends about 90 degrees. I just want to get back to some kind of normality and back to work and Im worried the lack of physio will slow this down. I also have Hyper Mobility Syndrome so my other knee is suffering! Im supposed to have the other done 6 mths time but I at present Im so fed up I just want my life back!

When I have been sat in the chair and rise from it the stiffness is terrible until I move around for a couple of mins. The pains are all the way down my leg to my ankle and I struggle to drive my car because the feet ache so much. Has anyone else had problems as such whilst having Osteo in their knees?

"14 weeks ago I had a right knee total replacement. My recovery has been remarkable. Other than waking with stiffness, and having my knee swell after P.T. I am well on my way to totally believing I did the right thing getting this done. Now, here is my issue. Last week I took my grandsons to Sea World. On Tuesday I walked around about 5 hours when my knee became so stiff I almost couldn't walk. I feared I was going to be unable to drive home. The pain however is NOT near my knee. It's in my left frontal area below the right knee, the area right before it turns into the calf muscle. I made it home, applied ice and took it easy with my leg elevated that evening. Upon waking the next day, it was still swollen and painful so I took it easy. On Thursdsy, I did the same trip again with the other grsndson with about the same hours walking. Once again, my leg became swollen, painful and really stiff. Here it is Sunday evening and it still looks like someone pumped up my leg. It's really not pain, except if I touch certain areas, but very uncomfortable. I was worried about a blood clot, )however, it's not red or warm to the touch. Has anyone else experienced something like this so far post surgery? I have therapy tomorrow and am dreading it due to how stiff it is and hard to walk. Thoughts????

"Just wanted to share that at my 6 week post op check in with my surgeon, I mentioned my frustration about sleeping difficulty. He said it is common and immediately wrote out a prescription for Amitriptyline (Elavil)--25 mg. He said to take it right before bed. He also said it is a very old medicine, often used for other things, but that at a low dose helps with sleeping. He also said it is non-addictive--that I can take it without worry about that.
I have taken just 1/2 of the pill (and sometimes more like 1/3) and every night have experienced a lot better sleep. I still wake up with some pain and need to take my Tylenol/ibuprofen mix that I usually take, but I am able to get back to sleep quickly. I sleep later in the morning, but once I am up, I don't feel groggy either. Very thankful for this medicine and wanted to pass this info along.
Wishing everyone some restful, healing nights!

"Anybody out there like me? After 15 years of knee pains and 3 ortho doctors who did little to inform me or help, a hemorrhage in the knee while in an MRI machine finally got me the results I needed to define my problem. PVNS causes bleeding, is not curable, is progressive and if one also has a genetic bleeding defect, then Heaven help you. When my knee swells, my whole leg is involved, it becomes one stiff, huge, severely painful limb that cannot be put down on the ground, much less stand on it.  The doctors always say in the USA to rate pain from one to 10 with 10 being crying. Well, my pain is crying, hysterics, screams to bystanders to help me quick as the swelling all happens in literally less than 2 minutes.  any of you who have had an active hemorrhage in a knee joint can agree. It is off the charts, cannot be measured.
I have enjoyed reading all these posts as I have felt so alone and distrustful of doctors who have shut doors on me when I ask questions that they cannot answer. At this point I have been told only that when I have these gigantic swellings, I can make an appointment on Monday or Wednesday or Friday to see a Physician's Assistant to try draining it and then a cortisone shot. In this country, they usually say you can only get 3 shots in the same joint, or the cortisone will be counterproductive. Well, I have had 2 already and feel I will never time my ""event"" to fit the schedule of the busy medical center in my valley. In short, they are done with me.
My kindly internist who knows me best has seen to it that I have  prednisone and pain pills on hand to use when needed and my hematologist has given me Transexamic Acid pills to slow bleeding when needed. It seems that my bleeding disorder is also very rare and is characterized by my forming a clot, reluctantly, then the clot will disolve and it bleeds again. I carry these meds along in a sack with my heavy knee brace and medical literature should I be caught on the streets without my husband when it hits and I have to convince someone what my problem is because I will need their help immediately. This is like an albatross around my neck, a constant reminder of my disability.  And I dare not look too far ahead into the future because I so much want to remain mobile and independent.
It has helped me to read these forums, but it also causes me to fear the future so much as I hear all of your pain line by line and inbetween the lines. Please continue writing as you are my only contact with the reality that I live with ....and you too.  I am quite old, but i have people to see, places to go, things to do, and I am not finished with life. You can all help me with your comments.

"I hope someone can help. A couple months ago i slipped and fell and my knee felt out of place ( ive had this happened a few time in my life and eventually the cap always goes back to where it needs to ) It was starting to get better then i had sqatted down and it fellt someone kind of pop and then it just got worse again and never improved. There was pain and LOTS of grinding. I went to a well know surgeon in my area who did an MRI and told me i had a menicus tear and they scheduled surgery. Due to the surgeons schedule the surgery wasnt until almost two months after the MRI. When i woke up from surgery they said that there was no tear. They said it could have either healed or there was no tear to begin with ( which would no explain all the issues i had with my knee before the surgery) But i am now 3 weeks post surgery or which techinally was a scope since they did not to the repair and I am still having issues. I can not bend my knee properly, I get very still and still have to ice it daily. If i did not need a repair, wouldnt i be much more improved 3 weeks after just a scope? They said 4-6 weeks recovery and i am in physial therapy twice a week. If there was no tear why such a recovery?

"Has anyone had anything similar?  It is 7 1/2 weeks post op TKR and as I've written on this site, have the usual post op issues and complaints with swelling, bending fatigue, and insomnia due to pain.    My doctor is 4 hours away in NYC and I will call in the morning but was wondering if anyone else had anything like this.  The scar is healing beautifully except for the top one closest to the thigh.  I showed it to my PT and she said it may be a stitch wanting to come out.  When she felt it, she felt a stitch and after I worked out, she thought it may have come out after workout.  I also showed it to another therapist the folllowing day and he said it does not look infected and not to be concerned.  I have had major surgery before but many years ago and somehow remembered there were areas that healed faster than others.  I don't like to put myself on antibiotics but I always have a Rx because of travel. I put a small amount of Aquaphor on the area because I've used it after surgery in the past.
So once again I am writing to the gurus of TKR for feedback.  Thank you....with gratitude, Marilyn

"So it has been 10 days since my tkr and the pain and healing process has been allot more than I had expected. I have definitely had some excruciating moments when I have not stayed ontop of the pain and waited a little too long to take my meds. I was given oxycodone 5mg (50) take 1-2 every 4-6 hours for pain. I have found that taking 2 every 4 hours has really made the pain ""manageable"". So with this quantity I ran out after 5 days. When I called my Dr to get a refill they were very hesitant to give me any more meds!! After crying on the phone to them they agreed to refill only 1 more time another 50 and after that no more! So I'm wondering is this normal to be off pain meds 2 weeks after a tkr?? Iv tried to stretch the length of taking them up to 5 hours buts it's not easy. I'm extremely upset looking forward to the pain when these meds are gone? Has anyone else had this issue?

"Hi
I am 58 and had a total right knee replacement 9th Feb 2016, so just over 5 months ago.  I was up and walking almost immediately and was discharged after 5 days in hospital.  I was doing my exercise that Iwas given and moving around as much as possibe.  I went to physio weekly.  After 3 months I was still struggling to bend it only reaching around 75.  MY physio said that if I couldn't reach at least 90 on the bend I would porobably have to go back to the consultant for a Manipulation Under Anaestetic. 
I am a police officer and lucky enough to be able t attend a rehab centre for a 2 week period with intense physio, so the hospital physio said that she would wait and see how I got on at the police rehab centre.
I did my 2 weeks and only managed at the most 90 but in the whole 2 weeks on maybe 2 occasions. The physio's there said exactly what the hospital physio's said.
I went back to the hospital physio's who referred me back to the consultant and got an appointment almost immediately.
I was told that in cases like mine the next step would be the MUA, however because I was over the initial 3 months post op period he was unable to do the MUA as it could possibly result in fractured bones.  As a result I have been given an appointment in December 2016 to see how it is then and if still cauing problems, will have to have itopened up again and the scared tissue scraped out.
I still can not walk upstairs properly and when I do I end up catching my bad leg on the steps.  I am unable to walk downstairs properly, still one step at a time.  I sit down at work, and even after just 10 minutes of sitting, I struggle to stand and walk straight away.  I still can not bend it the expected minimum of 90.  I am woken at night in pain and it is just getting to me now.
Any suggestions?

"Hi
Just thought i would add my little bit to the forum after my recent Orthopaedic consultation, I have had issues for the past 3 yrs initially with my knee, quickly followed by the Hip and Lumber spine. Diagnosed with Osteoarthritis of the left knee and left hip, Degenerative Disks, and Spinal instability. All likely due to a sewrious RTA i had on a motorbike back in 86. Left leg was left some 17mm shorter than the right due to Compound fractures of the Femur, and tib and fib.
Initially due to recieve spinal fusion and decompression surgery to the spine last January, but the Op was cancelled the day before due to the surgical team's concern's on was this the right course of action at this point.
The focus now is on the left knee first (now just on the waiting list) followed by the Hip once i have recovered from the first op, The Surgeon reckons this could be as early as 3mths after the knee? 
After both have been completed the Neurosurgeon says he will review the Spinal issues (the biggest problem pain wise) I am just hoping this is a good sign they are looking at possibly doing the fusion at a later date?
Sorry for the long post, and thanks for reading.

"Hi everyone
I am 43 and had both hips replaced one in dec and other in feb. I know have to get both knees done due to OA. My left knee at the moment is really painful and right not so bad l can't walk long distances but l am mobile now as my hip replacements have been so good.
I am really scared about getting my knees done as my doctor says its a lot.more painful than the hips and for a longer period.
Can l ask for some help?
When l wake up after having it done is my knee in some sort of brace and is the pain really bad.
Do they have you on a morohine pump where you press the button to administer your own dose as they did that with both hips for the day of surgery and the next day then l was put onto oral painkillers.
Does it feel like your leg is a dead weight for the first while like it did with my hips.
How big is the scar and is there a lot of stiches staples or whatever your surgeon uses?
Any advice would be great.
Thanks

"I had a spinal fusion and decompression two months ago. Have had no back pain but pain in both my knees seems to be getting worse. I thought it was because I am using my knees more for bending, thought maybe it's arthritis being affected by the cold weather, but honestly, it feels more like a muscular pain, particularly after walking and standing a lot. Anti-inflammatories don't seem to work on this particular pain and I am tired of taking pain pills. Is there a specific exercise one can do to strengthen muscles around knees?

"has anyone had an allergic reaction to the implant?  I am 13 weeks po.  I am experience some itching on the knee and around. No rash. I am allergic to artificial jewelry.  My knee looks normal. It still is pretty sore when getting up, stiff, sore at night when moving around. Clicks a lot when walking.  The itch is what scares me. My husband says probably healing.  I would think past that.  Scared a little, a lot.  Really don't want a revision. Just wondering if anyone has had this experience or allergy Thanks for your help.   Sandy

"Hi,
My mother has sudo gout in her knee and has been unable to bend her knee for nearly a month. She has arthiritus, osteoperosis, and is on coumadin. Because of coumadin, she can't take normal anti inflammatories. Doctors have told her to rest, which is not helping. She was recently prescribed prednisone 10mg. I've experienced far too many errors among doctors and simply don't fully trust their judgement. Is there anything else that can be done? Prior to this incident which came on rather sudden, she was walking about 10,000 steps/day.
Thanks

"Hi folks
Just been reading about clunking of the knee from another poster. I have had this from the start . Otherwise I think I have been doing quite well. Go to gym,swim,can walk a reasonable distance unaided. But I can still feel the knee. Sorry if this is petty but is it normal to feel small amount of pain after this length of time. Will it still be healing? Or is the clunking,a feeling rather than hearing,a sign that the knee will deteriorate more quickly than normal? I have thought about getting an x ray through my Westfield insurance. Any thoughts appreciated.

"hi, all. I'm almost 11 weeks po tkr right knee. I can't seem to keep the swelling at bay at all! My therapist says that she just did training on taping and suggests it will help me get the lymph flowing. I'm good when I get up in the morning but 10 min after and it starts. I do the icing, elevation etc but nothing lasts. Has anyone else had taping done?

"Happy to find this site and the many folks ready to share their experience.
I am 66 and have had Rheumatoid Arthritis for 13 years quite reasonably well managed on a parade of drugs by NYC and Asheville Rheumatologists. Now on Rituxan 4 doses a year. My knees started giving real pain 4-5 years ago, getting worse as time went by. I have TKR scheduled for July in North Carolina and find the positivity and tips here very helpful. I know to do leg and arm exercises now to strengthen them before surgery, and to eat a high fiber diet etc. Any other tips from TKR patients? Things you wish you had done before the surgery for example?
I am a bit concerned that the surgery might trigger the RA to become active again but my doctors seem to have the meds etc under control, what to stop and what to keep taking. The Rituxan infusions are due about now but have been postponed until August. 
Thanks.

"Hello, I'm @ 8 weeks post-op. For the first 6 weeks they were great and I thought to my self, this is a piece of cake. Since then it's just been a series up ups and downs, some good days some bad just like what they told me to expect. For the past few weeks I have been doing really well, except for some general swelling all around the knee. It gets so bad a sometimes I feel like it's a ballon that's about to pop! Incidentally, at about week 2-3 I developed a fluid pocket on the outside of my knee that is about the size of 1/2 dollar. During my 6 week evauation with my surgon, he was not to concerned with it and
refused to drain it. Sucess vs infection was not worth it. Even if we did it and it was initial successful, If would most like return soon. Addition he is not a fan of injecting metal into metal. The Doc was really happy overall with range of motion and my over all condition. My biggest issue then was just being so quick to fatigue and the swelling.
I sorry for such a lengthy introduction but I f thought it was important for you to know going into my main problem. Last night, spending partner of the morning playing a little golf, then did some shopping my wife and I spent about 4 hours at the pool. I was feeling pretty good for such a long day. Is hen we got home I went straight to the freezer, iced up while a took a break to relax a little.
HERE IS WHETE MY PROBLEM OCCURRD! I went to the bathroom and when I came out I felt a painful pop or snap like a large rubber band along with somebody cracking and snapping feelings. This is totally new and has never happened in the last 8 weeks at all! This made. me lose strength and stability on the out side of my knee. I lost my balance and fell into a wall. Thank God the wall was there or I would have hit the goor hard. I was in more pain with from this than any other part of this surgical procedure. It took everything I had to get to my recliner. I could not put any weight on the leg. Straight to the ice box and medicine cabinet. When I got up to go to bed I good not put any weight in it. Also, my calf and lower quad was extremely tight. After standing for a minute to loosen up, I started walking. Every step I took my knee would wobble or slightly buckle. ( my first thought was pmy ACL had popped) additionally, right in the junction of upper leg and lower just behind the knew cap I felt like I was grinding sand with the caps of my legs along with a harsh clicking as I walked. It also does this siting and just bending the knee.
Well I had PT this morning and she evaluated the situation. Her results sounded rather possitive overall. My stability was good so no ligiment damage. Eventhough I was in pain and could never be able to hold it my range was close to what it has been lately. She didn't see anything that made he think there was damage to the joint it's self of the hardware both my OEM or the new aftermarket one. After my training sessicion I was sore as hell and I have harder time walking as the day has progressed. Nothing I'm doing seem to help. She said we would work on it for a week to see what the results are before calling the surgon. This swelling combined with he addition weakness, and cracking and grinding does have me worried a bit. Well actually a lot of bits.
Here it the cherry on top - we are going to Italy in two weeks. I was feeling great about it and know I can't want and have started to panic.
Has anyone else expiereced this or a similar situation? Cause of problem? Should I be worrying and call the doctor now instead of try to work through it for a week or so? Any suggestions or advice? If so please advise. Thank you in advance and have a good evening.

Have OA in various places, then my left leg got sore and I went to the GP who said it was a pulled hamstring, a month laer it was much worse and had moved to the other leg then to knees as well....He said it was inflammed and upped my naproxen. He booked me in for an appointment. One knee came back ....arthritis the other one he saaid NO arthritis but didnt know what it was. I was sent for steroid injections, it got much worse after that. I then saw the consultant that did my THR's and he said he couldnt tell anything without an MRI so of I go again for MRI on both knees. Still waiting for the results. I've no idea about knees.....know more about hips with having 2 replacements. So dont know what it could be. Will that be a TKR or something else? I know you wont know, just trying to find out what things it could be  Sorry this is so long

"I injured both my knees around 4 years ago (two separate occasions). At the time i couldn't afford to pay for an MRI to actually see whats going on (still kinda can't). Both injuries i sustained in a weight-bearing twisting sort of motion (martial arts). Instead of getting an MRI and seeing a specialist, I went to see both chiros and physios and their orthopaedic tests came back negative. Throughout those 4 years my knees have been pretty weak, they would often give way(like a sheering like motion) when i suddenly pivot or twist (pretty much when suddenly put too much weight on them). Recently I injured my left knee again in the same manner. I was just wondering if its too late to remedy like surgery wise. I left it for a while without knowing what happened and kinda just let it heal on its own. I was just wondering if anyone would have any idea about this topic.

"My surgery was June 02, I'm 5 week today since my total knee replacement. I've had a lot of discomfort in that whole area, even when the blanket, or any clothes touches the skin, but never experiment any excruciating pain on my knee, never tuck pain pills since day one at he hospital. Drugs make me feel extremely bad. For me, they are worse than the pain. My biggest problem has always been my calf and tendon behind my leg.This has prevented me from doing my exercises well and extend my leg straight. I do not know why that area hurt so much and being so stiff. I went to see my surgeon four weeks after surgery July 1, and recommended me exercise in pool, which I've already been doing for 4 days, approximately 3 hours daily. He told me that I wasn't where I should be for this date. Referring to where the leg should be flexed. I had a lot of swelling and did not ask to much. He sent 4 weeks therapies and to see him after that, adding that if there is no improvement with therapies that he had to make it work, I didn't undestand what he means with that. He also sent some anti-inflammatory drugs that I'm taking once daily. Inflammation has improved, but I do not see any change, or improvement in the flexibility of the knee. Today is my first therapy. I feel that is going to be painful. We'll see.

"Hi All,
As you know, I am so grateful to all of you who are sharing your TKR journey.  It takes away a lot of guessing and fear when you read everyone's road to recovery.  As mentioned in my previous blog, 4 weeks TKR and I have swelling and a lot of pain. I was doing well after 3 weeks but on the fourth week I had a setback.   I have been in touch with my ortho team and they prescribed the protocol of continuing PT, rest, ice, elevation, and Voltarin.
My son-in-law was at a get together with neighbors for the holiday weekend and he spoke to a woman who had a double knee replacement several years ago.  She told him that a rocking chair was her best PT exercise.  
Fast forward, my son-in-law went to their storage room and took out a rocking chair and set it up for me.  The motion and holding 6 seconds was very comfortable and I felt a nice range of motion after doing it.
Just thought I would share something new.
Sending all healing vibes

However....,I still cannot walk outside the house without two crutches. My Physio puts this down to loss of muscle function in my hips, and thinks I may need a further OA clinic appointment as I have only ever had an X-ray of my right knee.
My question is, is it as unusual as I think still to be on two crutches? Frankly I feel much more disabled now than I did before the op, as at least then I could do a supermarket shop, carry an umbrella etc. Although I have to admit that I have been avoiding activities that need mobility for more years than I care to remember.

"So I am a 22 year old female. A couple years ago I fell hard onto my knee, onto a peice of chunky concrete. It was on a construction job. Anyways, all my weight onto that knee.. I was able to walk on it, but barely. It was very bruised and swollen, and the kneecap appeared a bit pointed at the time. I fell on it a few times after that ( usually not accident prone ) I'm guessing because of the week knee. Anyways, I haven't had manyyy problems, aside from running/jogging, standing on it for long periods of time, crossing legs for long periods of time, and sharp pain when running up stairs, when lifting my leg. There is also a little bump I can feel below my kneecap that I can somewhat move around. I'm getting tired if this and want to get back into rugby, but obviously not an option right now. Has anyone had a similar injury, and could tell me how to rehabilitate it, of what the treatment was?

After about three days after the running my knees entered into so much pain I can barely walk - that was two weeks ago and I am still sitting here suffereing in mind numbing pain. I went to the ER twice (as I don't have a GP here) and they gave me an antiinflammatory and now a steroid pack - yet I am still in so much pain, like to the point of tears - in both knees. The pain is almost a burning sensation in knee that can radiate to my shin and/or my thigh..I ice it regularly throughout day as thats only relief I get - I have no narcotic pain meds and can't take any as I was an opiate addict in past - but I am in literally so much pain that I've considered going back out to find some street opiates to handle this pain - The pain hurts more after I walk up/down the stairs in my house and I can barely manage that its so painful to walk..it almost seems its gotten worse over past two weeks..I'm trying to get an apt with an ortho doc to get an MRI as I'm afriad I tore the ligaments in both knees - I have no history of knee problems and this is the worst! I am in pain even when I lay down, I can barely walk and I'm feeling hopeless about this because the pain hasn't subsited after two full weeks. Any suggestions are highly appreicated thank you in advance.

"Hello Everyone
Sorry this is my 3rd time posting question but I am just about losing it. I thought I was doing pretty good and since I went to the convention I have just been in constant pain when I walk .  Or maybe it is just becuase I am back to work and on it more. It is a terrible pulling on the opposite side of the replacement. I remember I had that right after surgery and now it has come back. I am at my whits end over it. Boy or boy this is not easy.

Just a warning to all fellow TKR recipients not to try and do too much even when you feel fine and have reached 10 weeks post op!
I drove my car two days running on fairly long journeys ( two hour round trips with a rest of an hour in between) and I now actually feel  ill, let alone having very nasty pains in my knee! It was also very painful actually driving for a long period even though I have an automatic car! Yes, I should have known better as this is my second TKR but when you feel well you tend to do too much and forget that you'll pay for it later ?? ! 
Take care all of you!

"I am 10 months pkr. Because my knee was collapsing in causing me pain upon walking or standing I took Physical Therapy one month to strengthen ligaments and tendons. My knee is somewhat better but still collapsing from time to time and causing sudden severe pain while walking or just working around the kitchen. It seems the pain happens when the knee gets twisted slightly in anyway. After sleeping with my legs curled up trying to straighten the leg out is extremely painful. My doctor, after examining the knee, does not know why this is happening. So he is sending me to another doctor for a second opinion. I'm just wanting to know if anyone out there has had similar experience. I am thankful for this blog that has gotten me through so far.

"I wrote before but don't know how to continue conversation. I am now 3 1/2 weeks TKR. I am not having a lot of pain unless I overdo walking or exercises. My question is when will it begin to feel normal? I still cannot sleep on my side, it hurts to do so. I am just beginning at home to use a cane instead of the walker, I only started yesterday but when tired I go back to walker. I started PT after 2 weeks and the therapists said my leg does well with laying flat and the bend is not bad for now but still needs work. I go to PT twice a week and do home exercises the other days. I have a very bad left hip and it's my left knee that was replaced so PT has to be slow and easy. If not for a bad fall I would have replaced the hip first, but had no choice. Went out to eat last night with hubby and daughter and her family. I sat in a booth with bad leg at outer edge. I did fine, but it was sore from holding it bent when I got home. First night I had a hard time sleeping. I don't like to take but one pain Med a day now and it wasn't screaming in pain, just being uncomfortable. I iced it, that usually helps but didn't do the job last night. I just over did it I guess. It was fine today and I tackled changing the bedding on our split King adjustable bed (no small feat under normal circumstance). Got it done though, they hadn't been changed since getting home from hospital and I love clean sheets. Should help me sleep tonight. I'm feeling restless but get very tired if I walk too much. That surprised me since walking is so elementary and it doesn't hurt much, just wears me out very quickly.  When does that change? I hope to be able to grocery shop or go to bank etc. soon. Doctor says I can drive our automatic since it's my left knee but that doesn't help if I can only walk a few feet after getting somewhere. Should I keep trying to build stamina walking? How long does it usually take to be able to do normal chores like grocery shopping? Hubby has his own health issues and is not much help with things. Doctor told me I'd need help for 2 weeks, now since that is over hubby expects me to be back to normal. I'm trying...

"Hi All,
I am posting this as I'm currently at a bit of a loss. I've had knee problems for about 2 and a half years and I've had not much progress in terms of getting better. I'm hoping that you can help and provide me your opinion on what I should do next.
My story starts back on 18th May 2014. I was playing football for a local football team when I was tackled quite hard. As soon as I was tackled I heard a loud crack. It probably didn't look like anything happened from anyone watching but to me the pain was excruciating. I ended up coming off and within minutes I knew there was something wrong, my knee was clicking and popping more than usual.
Weeks later after the swelling had gone down I went to see my GP who said that my knee looked fine but probably needed draining. I had it drained and my GP said give it another month and go back if there was no improvement.
A month later I went back and was immediately referred for an MRI scan. This took a further 6 weeks before I got my appointment.
After having the MRI scan it took another 6 weeks before I the had my follow up appointment. It turned out that I had torn my meniscus which required surgery to fix.
I was booked in to have this surgery 3 months later, by this time a year had passed since I initially injured my knee.
7 weeks later and I had my post op appointment with the consultant. Everything seems ok from my side. The popping was still there but was told it would stop as the swelling went down. 
Another 3 months passed and my knee was still popping, locking and clicking. I went back to see my GP who referred my to physio. I had my first session and within 30 minutes the physio said this wasnt right and to go back to my GP. I went back and was once again given an MRI scan.  The results came back ok. My meniscus was still in tact and the surgeon said there was nothing wrong.
Since then I've been in the gym for 6 months building my strength up. I still have had popping, locking and clicking and had no improvement. 
Anyway I got a call last week to play in a local 5 a side football tournament, I decided to give it a go and within 5 minutes I had to come off. I got this weird feeling in my knee, like it was very tight and being crushed. It progressively got worse. I went straight home to ice it. Three days later and my knee is swollen as big as a football. I believe I need it draining again too.
I'm at a bit of a loss as to what I'm supposed to do next. I'm 29 years old and struggling to do the sport I love. I can barely do any fitness and it seems to me like there is obviously something else that must be the matter. I can't afford to go private. What in your opinion is wrong with me? Why is it taking so long to get this sorted? What am I to do next?
Please help.

"i broke my femur right above my knee March 2016. Had surgery, with 3 screws inserted,then CPM 8 hrs a day for a month plus NWB for 3 months along with a hinged brace when up. Had P.T. thruout the 3 months. Naturally with my limitations my knee stiffened. When I left the hospital, flexion was 45 degrees on CPM. By 8 weeks I was up to 65-70 with therapy. Doc said if I wasn't to 90 by 10 weeks, he wanted to do manipulation. Worked hard with therapy and at next visit was at 100-105, but doc still wanted to do it. I was very nervous about that considering I was not full wt bearing yet and prob not healed as he said there was a ""small chance"" he could break it during manipulation. I decided after talking with my therapist not to do it. With hard work my flexion increased to almost 120, then after beginning FWB at 12 weeks, I had persistent pain with walking to the inside of my knee. Doc said I had an MCL tear also which he told me at 10 weeks when I complained of pain there with flexion. He decided maybe my bottom pin was irritating my MCL which X-ray confirmed. He decided to take it out so at 14 weeks I went back to surgery and had it removed. He told me he was going to manipulate it while I was under , that it would help with my flexion with therapy. So here I am, two days post-op with another incision and a very, very sore, swollen thigh and knee. Has anyone ever had this type scenario and will my flexion be better if my quad muscles ever get back to normal? I'm getting frustrated!

"Well having waited for my appointment to see my orthopaedic surgeon for about12 weeks I'm now in pieces. When I originally saw him privately in February he looked at my xrays and was surprised that I was in so much pain with my right knee as it showed only mild OA whilst my left knee which was much less painful showed much worse OA. He transfered me to his nhs list and had further xrays done and then referred me for an mri. I finally saw him today to discuss the results. I feel that both my knees have deteriorated since the last time I saw him probably due to my holiday in Dubrovnik where we had to walk down a steep hill and 180 steps to get into the town and then the same trip in reverse to get back to our apartment. I now can barely walk more than 2 or 3 yards without being in agony which means that I am pretty much housebound now. I am only 56 and can't imagine how I'm going to manage to live like this. Anyway to get to the point he, the surgeon said that the mri only showed a lot of debris so a new knee wasn't appropriate. He said that he would do an arthroscope and repair a torn meniscus. I've read several reports which say that arthroscopies usually didn't work and most people then had a knee replacement anyway. He said that he'd seen many people like me who were in terrible pain, had a tkr and still had the same pain even after surgery. I must confess that I was in tears and asked him why I was in such pain if there was nothing obviously wrong. He said he honestly couldn't say. I asked for a further xray to see if there has been any more deterioration which he agreed to. I went for my xray and am now waiting to hear from him. I know that having a tkr if it's not necessary would be stupid but I can't bear this pain for much longer. Have any of you had an arthroscopy and had a successful result? Sorry for the long post!!

"I had a total knee replacement of right knee in January 2014.  In September 2015, a very large dark bruise appeared on my knee cap where the device can be felt.  My knee had not been hit, no falls or other explanation.  The surgeon has no explanation, says he has never seen it before, had another surgeon look at it with same reaction.  He did an xray, then ordered a scan.  Does not suggest surgery because he doen't know what he would be looking for.  Actually I believe him and feel he really has never seen it.  My GP doctor and I have agreed that I wouldn't even think about surgery unless something else arises.  These bruises continue to come and go.  My knee hurts but is not debilitating as much as my overall osteo arthritis.  I just plan to live with it.

"I have pain in both knees and it's limiting my life. It is a grinding and burning pain that happens when I walk.
I’ve had MRIs, X-rays and blood tests, but they have shown nothing.
Just before the knee pain started I was doing 20 minutes of jumping jacks a day. And before that I was using the treadmill for 30 to 60 mins a day. But surely if that had caused the problem it would have healed after 2 years or it would show on the scans.
At the start of this year, I have managed to build up to walking outside for a bout 20 minutes before the pain starts. However, a few months ago I was referred to a physiotherapist and now even this 20 minutes of walking has become difficult. 
I find the physiotherapists exercises to cause pain. However, she says it’s normal and after a while the pain will stop. But I have been doing them for a few months and seen no improvements (The pain from the excersies has lessened, but I’ve not seen an improvement in my ability to walk without pain). 
I’d really appreciate any insights as I have tried everything, but I just can’t get me knees better!
I am a 33 year old male living in England.

Is this normal? When I exercise at home I have no swelling or stiffness. I do not feel like physical therapy is any more strenuous then what I'm doing at home.
Don't want to go to doctor about the swelling, it goes all the way down to my ankle area, if others have this problem.

I was told ( after getting a second opinion!)  there were problems with alignment and rotation, hence the reason it failed. The whole thing had to be redone 4 months ago, and I now have a rotating platform prosthesis with long stemmed rods which go into my tibia and femur. This has been a horrendous time for me, as I used to be fit and very active ( 62 ) and only had it done because I had worn my knee out as a runner.  . Anyone out there had a revision, and if so, how long was the recovery? I am now at 4 months and it's still painful to walk any distance. Cheers Catherine

I need work on quad and muscles on the side of my knee. I started doing straight leg lifts today laying down tightening my muscles and lift straight up a few inches. Hold it then put it down
This plus others that I have been doing. I have had terrible pain under my kneecap. It's a burning pain. Iced it and elevated it but is still there. My walking is a little wobbly so really need to work on my muscles. Does anyone have exercises that will strengthen the side muscles? I was doing so well. I thought I was done with going backwards. Thank you. Hope everyone is having a great day!

"I am 68 yr. old and had my left knee tkr 10 days ago. I was already a candidate for tkr but had hoped to do hip first when an unexpected fall in April 2016 changed all of that. I had meniscus tears and a lot of trauma to my kneecap. I had already been doing steroid injections for years so decided it was time. I had no idea how much pain I would be in and how hard it would be to try to do most things on my own. I woke in the hospital feeling no pain for 2 days because I had a nerve block during the surgery. I saw the PT ladies once in the hospital when they had me get up and use a walker. They would not let me walk very far and I was released the next day. I was not given any exercises or directions except that walking was good for me. I see the surgeon this Wednesday to have staples removed and I assume maybe have some PT set up? I read through this forum and see how important the exercises are but cannot really find a time line for them. Am I okay not starting them right away? I still have a lot of pain and ice and raise my leg frequently. I have finally been able to shower and wash my hair etc. Standing while doing all of that makes me really tired and hurting but I manage. Mostly I would rather just stay in bed or sleep, but am trying to get up daily. I am keeping pain Meds at a minimum because when I first got home I had a horrible bout of constipation. Then I used Miralax and had a horrible diarrhea episode (I have IBS-D).  I cannot seem to figure out the right balance and get pain relief. I cannot take any NSAIDS because of low kidney function so am prescribed Percocet. It does help, doesn't eliminate the pain but definitely helps, still afraid to take it more than once a day.

"I was disagnosed with a torn cartiliage and arthritis in my right knee back in March.My job involves standing all day most day and a lot of walking around.I feel better moving around than I do sitting too long as I stiffen up.I have to wait another 5 weeks before I see my consultant but I am noticing more an more that I am in constant pain through out the night.I don't sleep all night but I am waking up every hr with a very heavy feeling and pain in my knee and it feels very uncomfortable when I try and turn over.Generally when I have got home from work and relaxed I try and get up stairs I can really struggle quite a lot.My knee can still hurt me when I get out of bed the next morning.They might decide to try arthroscopy surgery.Is this the answer or will it get better on its own.I tried physio but it didn't help.

Went to the Dominican in Jan and because of my own carelessness got both legs severely sun burned from foot to past my knee.  When I went for my year check up surgeon was upset to say the least my bend was 102.  Because I as unable to bend my legs for almost 3 weeks due to the burn all my muscles tightened up. I'm now back in physio.  Knee bends but muscles and tendons won't let it bend far enough.  Just a word of warning to everyone  now that the lovely warm weather is here.

"I am in need of a total knee replacement. However, I also just finished nursing school and have a potential job opportunity that is really difficult to pass up.  I did not actively seek this - they approached me; I was planning on waiting until after surgery. As I prepare for my final set of interviews I am going to talk to them about the need to have this done and ask them if they would be willing to wait for me to recover enough to come in to the office and begin training on less physical tasks. How long has it taken you all to feel up to being up, moving around and driving following TKR? Of course I realize that one must be done with pain killers and have the ok to drive from MD, but how has your recovery gone? My timing stinks on this however you look at it, but I'm trying to be optimistic and not regret a missed opportunity.  Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

"I am 11wks post TKR and 3 wks post MUA.   Had difficulties with meds prescribed and even after the MUA  low bend.  
After my MUA I have had 3 x soft tissue massage and 2 x hydrotherapy sessions.   The soft tissue I pay for and the hydro is on NHS - the first therapy I have had since my TKR.  
In this period my knee bend has gone from 25 to 70 - ok its low compared to most of you BUT it is a real achievement to me.   I thought I was doomed to never move again.  I also feel positive that this can improve even more,
I dont over exercise, I go to my Physio sessions, and have bad days.   but generally feel better than I did.
I would ask everyone to insist and fight for Physio after a TKR.   We all need that support to achieve a normal movement and life.

But.....I still can't walk outside without crutches. Am in UK so took myself off to a good private physio, who says the problem is that my hip muscles (glutes) are very weak as I have had so little exercise for so long. I've been crawling up stairs, unable to get into a bath etc for about ten years. He says the resulting weakness will take some time to overcome.....but that with time and effort, I will be able to do it.

"Hey everyone
I have had 2 hip replacements done one in december and 2nd in middle of february. I am still in recovery from them but was trying to go walks and after l could manage a couple of miles when l got home my knee's were in so much pain and swollen and l could barley walk for a while after it or climb stairs. I thought it was just all to do with my hip replacements but as times went by l am still getting pain walking so went back to my gp who sent me for xrays of my hips and knee's. I was called back a week later to be told l have OA in both knee's he said they are both severly scarred. I have been reffered back to the hospital that done my hips and have an appointment next week. I have no idea what this means for me does it mean l might need knee replacements as well or is the keyhole surgery that they go in and clean out the knee's an option?
The doctor said l will know how badit is with the level of pain and it will be the surgeon that knows best but they might try injections.
I need help what is the injections for to reduce the pain but in the longrun l still will need replacements.
Any help would be great.
I don't know what he means by severe scarring do l have cartliage left or not or is it the same as my hips were as they were bone to bone and thats why l needed replacements.
I am not scared if l do need replacement as its got to the stage l have been in this state for si long l just want to be normal again. I have been off my work since november last year and have lost all my confidence as l have been stuck at home for so long. Don't get me wrong l can drive again and walk small amounts but l am limited to that and l can't go back to work as l am unable to sit fir more than 3hrs on a chair without being in pain in my back and hips and my job is sitting at a desk for 7 hrs.
Thanks

"Hello everyone.... I enjoy reading everyone's progress and hope that those who aren't doing as well as they hope, continue to push on and do your exercises. It's been a bit over 4mths since my revision and my knee at times feels sideways! My PT coach (who I had with my first op as well as my revision) told me that my knee will never feel the same. I can honestly say that my knee has never stopped hurting since the 1st op in Sept of 2015. I have learned to grin and bear the pain and move on. I work full time and I must say I am a bit conscience of my not walking ""totally proper"" yet but my co-workers are cool and tell me when I am limpling (which we all know is easy to do when you are tired). I am now going down the stairs foot over foot (""properly"") half-way. My husband is awesome and tells me when I do things ""not the right way"" and sometimes I cry cause this op has totally changed my life! My family physician thought I was depressed when I went for my physical on Tues of this week cause I cried when he asked how I was doing. I just feel overwhelmed sometimes because I can't be as active as I was. It sucks! I know it will take a year or two to heal - and with me having a revision 5mths to the day of my pkr, I know the healing will take longer. I am so encourgaged by reading everyone's posts. With the way the world is today, I should feel lucky that I have my leg and I am able to walk - even if I don't walk ""properly""... Take care guys....xo

"Hi everyone. I hope we are all doing as well as we can be, under the circumstances!! 
I spent a lovely two days looking after a pooch in a Sydney harbourside mansion. The family are a very busy one and this housesit was a prelude to the 3 weeks they've booked me for, in July. The pooch is a Westie (West Highland white terrier). They are great little doggies, almost as delightful as Jack Russell Terrorists.
Anyway I had a bit of enlightenment, sleeping in a lovely bed, in a room with a fireplace, listening to the ferries come and go.
I recently weighed myself and I've lost about 10 kgs. I'm no longer food focused and I wonder what happened to me under that anaesthetic?
I find that my thoughts are on moving, always moving. I cannot sit still. When I sit down and get up after 20 mins of puppy patting, my knees are so stiff and sore it's just as easy to either lie down or go for a walk.
Perhaps this is what I was always supposed to do than sit on the lounge watching Netflix with the air conditioner on 25 degrees, munching on pizza and licorice and my fave of all time, black jelly beans.
Has anyone noticed any positive side effects from their surgery??Maybe it's just the Norspan 5 mg opiate pain patch deluding me!
Have a wondrous day folks! Remember all this is only temporary! The best is yet to come (I hope!)
Best wishes

"I am 8 weeks after TKR and get a variety of pains in my leg/knee when I walk. They vary daily but the worse pain is often in my ankle. Does anybody else get this?
My bend varies from 90 - 100 degrees but its agony to get beyond 90. I don't seem to improve so sitting for a long time hurts. Anybody else like this?
Thank you

"7 weeks post-op PKR, U.S.A. Normal progression so far, although painful and unpleasant, at least no complications. Up until now I would take an oxycodone about an hour before P.T. exercises or doing anything anticipated to be more strenuous, which would allow me to do it without undue pain, thus proving that physiologically at least I could do more normal range-of-motion movements, otherwise too painful.
But having perhaps “pushed the envelop”, after the exertion the pain returns in full force, only to require medication (icing, elevation, etc.) again. Is the only solution, to struggle with pain and doing less well, a depressing scenario?
At this point my doctor is weaning me from oxycodone (far superior in speed and effect), and is substituting Tramadol (with or without Tylenol and ibuprofen), which has little effect.
I guess my question is, does oxycodone give a false sense of progress (since one is physiologically able to do more), or is the pain there as a warning that some movements are premature to real healing?
Any light on this would be appreciated.

"Good Morning , I am new to this, but at the moment I'm wishing I had never had this done. I had a TKR done on Friday, the epidural and sedation didn't work so had to have a general. The pain relief I got whilst in hospital was good, came home yesterday and all I've got is paracetamol and coedine, which has no effect at all, slept in 20 minute intervals all night. Our dog had her crucial element ligament done about 17 months ago and she was on better pain relief. I am honestly regretting what I have done, sorry for sounding so negative.

"My knee has very little pain, and I have full range of motion.  However, at 13 weeks post opp I'm in more pain than before surgery.  I have been to ER once, my doctor once, urgent care twice, PT twice a week for 12 weeks, and called 911 over memorial day weekend because I couldn't walk or get out of bed with muscle spasms in the calf area. Excrutiating pain. No one can figure out what is wrong. I think I was pushed too far to do too much PT. They have confirmed there is no infection or blood clot.  Great then what is causing this pain?  Family members have massagedthe area and it feels like the calf pamuscle spasm has broken up.  the area for me and hot epson salt baths helped.  The swelling became worse in my 10th week post opp. The calf pain started at 6 weeks post opp.  In my 12th week the Paramedic felt both calves and said my surgery leg calf muscle was contracting. He siad it needs to be worked out in PT thru massage and heat, & ultra sound. However,  PT won't massage because they are still afraid of moving a blood clot  The pain is in the crease of the back of my knee and then the whole leg is tight, with a lot of swelling.  The muscle spasms have died down, thank God because they are pretty unbearable. See the doctor this Monday.  I'd like to hear from people with similar circumstances that are as far along as me or more.  TY

"Hi All,
Firstly, Thank you all for your input and advice over the last few weeks.
Yesterday I had my 6 week PO review with my surgeon, he was very happy with every aspect of my recovery. However, when I mentioned returning to work, he was adamant that not for another 6 weeks. He said that too many people feel pressure to go back to work too soon, do damage by overdoing it and kick themselves 12 - 18 months later due to some form of correction or achieving less than optimum results.
My work would require about 50/50 office/factory floor walking and an hours commute.
I would welcome input / opinions from anyone's experience.
Thanks,
Al

"gosh does that sound defiant!!!!!!!
For those of you I haven't bored to death I had a TKR 8 weeks ago and then an MUA 1 week ago.   Due to an intolerance to the prescribed drugs my TKR leg seized up & left me with a bend of 10 and although it improved after the MUA (on the day) I left hospital with 70.  I still havent had any physio input - just the CPM machine after the MUA.
Everything I read on here says how vital Physio is - I am trying to do it on my own but am I doing it right?   I have read about soft tissue manipulation and went to that today - I now have increased my bend by 30 and without pain.   I have received exercises to do at home.
I have contacted the hospital where I had my op and have spoken to the PALs team (patient liaison) and they are meeting me next week.   Has anyone else done this and how did you get on?

"I have been so encouraged and blessed as I read the postings from others who are going through TKR recovery.  I am 6 weeks post and I must say that even though I thought I had read plenty and was well prepared, now I know I don't believe I knew how I would feel.  I am certainly looking forward to feeling much better than I did with the arthritis in the right knee, but that surely isn't happening
yet.
I am frustrated today as I caught myself when I slipped on a step and bent my operative knee somewhat ackwardly, causing what feels like a pulled muscle across the knee.  I still went to my therapy session but spent most of the day laying down and icing off and on.  
The surgeon set a goal of 110 flexion by the end of 4 weeks, at the latest the end of 6 weeks.  I have been struggling with this and reached 104 at one point a week or so ago but with a great deal of pain.  He wants to stretch the muscles with some machine to get me to the 110, yet the therapist seems to think with continued work I will get there.  I do my exercises 2-3 times a day including the 2 weekly therapy appointments so I am not a slacker on trying to improve my ROM.
I am wondering what others have experienced with this?  I am pretty discouraged.  When I try to do more I hurt myself.  Of course today isn't good since I pulled that knee.  I am continuing pain meds as I still need them including oxycodene, Tylenol, and naproxen.
I have not returned to work yet.  The surgeon said that most return 8-10 weeks post, many starting back part time at first.  I guess my return will depend on the ROM I reach and whether I can handle the pain without the narcotic.  I have tried but I am unable to sleep due to the pain so I am not ready yet.

I lost my knee bend and was put forward for an MUA which happening Mon 23/5  (7 wks TKR post op) .   Before leaving hospital I was told I would be having intensive PT and yesterday had hydrotherapy before leaving hospital which gave me amazing results.   I have been changed to Tramadol and paracetamol.   I have taken 3 doses x Tramadol in the last 16hrs.   I have not taken my 4.30pm dose because like the other drug this is knocking me out!   I did my exercises this morning and had to go to bed after my 12.30 dose my head was so heavy.

"I have posted about the rash on my tkr knee before. Ive had the rash almost from surgery in November last year. Surgeon who did op said allergic reaction to the metal is ""almost unheard of"" but I sought a 2nd opinion with an emiment surgeon privately. He told me the same,that there were no known cases of this happening. Said it was ""incisional folliculitis"" to do with the drainage. Also that it would probably clear in time. He prescribed me antibiotics. Flucloxacillin. One weeks supply . No drastic change in the rash after 3 days but I am more reassured that this is nothing worse. He also noted that the rash is only on one side of the scar. . Posting this in reply to all the kind members who have tried to help. Any further comments or questions appreciated.

"Greetings from Sydney. This forum has assisted me to understand some of the awful stuff we go through after surgery and to know I am not alone in feeling downright horrid some days. Today is a great one though.
I ceased heavy pain medication a couple of weeks ago and that was a mistake. I am back on Norspan 10 mg patches and can now do all my exercises and achieve a few hours sleep before I need to top up with a Tramadol.  I've lost 12 kgs in weight simply because my appetite diminished but now I'm trying to eat 3 meals a day and include protein at every meal instead of nibbling and feeling like I want to sleep all day.
I am allergic to many pain medications (unknown until post op) so pain was a big issue for me. If you are contemplating TKR's or have already had them, then get your pain medication stabilised and physio will be so much easier. I have also found hydrotherapy (pool walking) to be a god-send. Today is the first day post op that I feel any where like normal. I was a fit, energetic 63 year year old before my op and I hope to return to that state with much improvements in my knees, in the near future. I believe I will be looking at 6 months recovery time before I can resume a ""normal"" exercise program of spin, walking, boxing and weights.  
No one tells you about the pain, the depression, the disruption to your life, especially not your surgeon. Just be patient, eat well, try to get a walk in each day or a swim and stay positive. At nearly 10 weeks I can see the light at the end of that long tunnel.
Best wishes
Lyn

"I have just had an operation to repair damage to the cartlidge in my knee. However on my check up I was informed that my knee is grade 5 and requiring knee replacement. After reading and following the posts in this group, I think I will opt out of the surgery as there is more negatives to having the surgery and it had put me off having it done,It sounds horrendous the amount of suffering and limited mobility even with a new knee. I see the surgeon next month to give him my decision.
Thanks for all your posts that I have read which has helped me make my decision.

"Just had my second physio session today for my knee which has arthritis and a torn meniscus.I feel it is a waste of time as she has given me exercises especially to do but doesn't seem to give me any treatment herself on my knee.It has been 2 weeks since I saw her and am going back in another 2 weeks.It is only about a 15 minute appointment so hardly any time at all but it is the NHS.I am not seeing the consultant until the end of July but there was mention about trying arthroscopic surgery but I am not sure if I want this or not.I am not in pain 24/7 but my knee feels achy and uncomfortable all the time and I feel more pain when going up and down stairs.Advise needed please

"I'm 20 years old and female. Around 9 I got Osgood schlaughter disease and since then I've been in and out of physical therapy with constant knee pain. At 15 (2010) I had a lateral release performed on both knees due to a dislocating Patella. Since then, I have also had a shoulder surgery for a constantly dislocating shoulder (plus 4 tears). I have dislocated or subluxed hips, toes,elbows, knees, shoulders, patellas, ribs...
Basically, my whole body is loose and has many problems. One of my knees though is really bad at this point with pain down to medial mid shin and up the IT band. My knees hyperextend around 30 degrees and bend 4 directions in general.
Anytime I go to a doctor they just send me to pt without doing new tests. How can I convey to a doctor that my knee pain is significant, keeping me up at night and leading me to tears during an easy 5 minute bike ride?

"When I was in kindergarten, I was pushed by a friend on accident and fell bluntly on my knees onto asphalt. All I remember was that I couldn't get up and walk for about a week and I had a huge, deep scar. After that, I would experience this type of aching/stabbing pain deep in my patella with swelling and stiffness at times, in one knee if not both at a time. Most of the time, it would be triggered by my knees being exposed to the cold and simply walking barefoot on cold tile floor. Sometimes there was no trigger at all. I've used Bengay like no other and NSAIDs as needed (sometimes I would just sit through the pain). Today, I'm 23 years old and don't experience it that often, but I do get crackling/crunching noises whenever I straighten or bend my knees; sometimes accompanied with pain. There are times where my knee is feeling strained and seems like it wants to give out. Is it possible that I had developed some form of arthritis despite being a really young age when my injury occured?

"Hello Madam/Sir,
I fell while skiing on January 19th and just after the accident my left knee was in huge pain, I barely could walk. After sitting for 10 minutes I continued skiing. I didn't feel any significant pain in my knee for about 1 month after that accident. Then I started feel discomfort and sometimes my knee got swollen. I got a MRI scan and there were Mild joint effusion, MM low grade degeneration. I couldn't find right doctor that could make right diagnose and help me until May. The doctor I found diagnosed that I had had throat bronchitis before that accident and it affected to my knee to sore. I had some drop injections through my vein and he has drained my knee 4 times during 2 weeks. It really made difference, and my knee became look like the normal one. However pain has releived significantly, I still feel a little discomport after some walk, my knee gets tired and being in little pain. Does somebody had similar case? What should I do now? Thank you for your time Sir.

They gave me antibiotics b/c they discovered the arthroscope they used was non-sterilized
i was supposed to take steroid pills to help prevent or reduce the scar tissue from my surgery. but now that im forced to take antibiotics, they cancelled the steroid pills b/c it would have a negative effect in case there is inflamation.
Would the steroids have helped in preventing arthrofibrosis??

"Hi all, as the title suggests, I have a litte more information than the last time I posted - but not much!
I saw my Consultants' Registrar today - had a REALLY long chat with her, and came away at least not thinking that Im cracking up or overstating my pain....
Top and bottom of it, Ive got to have a full Bone Scan done, to try and identify where exactly the severe pain that im experiencing (nearly 15 months post-op) is coming from. She's sure its not coming from the cyst that I have, so thats pretty much ruled out and wont need to be removed, yay!
However....Theres a good possibility of early loosening of the prosthesis. Which is NOT good news. If it turns out thats the cause, then it will need a revision surgery. Which wouldnt be carried out by my surgeon, but more of a specialist one. And Ive been told they always recommend a second opinion when things reach that stage. 
Another possibility is deterioration of my kneecap (it wasnt ""resurfaced"" durng surgery). Im slightly more inclined to lean towards this reason, but what do I know? My Registrar actually spoke to my Surgeon a couple of times during my appointment, just to reassure me that he was in full agreement with what treatment she planned, and apparantly he was adamant that I shouldnt be experiencing anywhere near this level of pain at this stage in my recovery, and that a bone scan was indeed a vital diagnostic for me.

"I am 17 weeks post op bilateral knee replacements and was doing PT consistently 3 times a week.  It's been a rough road and although I haven't ever had depression this process has really messed with my mind.  The pain, the time commitment to exercise with such tiny improvements, feeling slow and broken - it all took a toll on my spirits.  Last week my surgeon and I agreed it was time to schedule manual manipulation under anesthesia.  I was very nervous about the procedure but it was quick and the pain after was minimal. My surgeon said its now up to me because he has done all he can.  The results were great and I am now walking well, doing stairs without a cane and feeling my age not 40 years older.  I had pt the next day and scheduled 2 more sessions this week.  Prior to this there was no way I could have done 3 appointments in a row due to pain and swelling.  I am a little sore but nothing compared to how I felt just a week ago.  I have slept with a small pillow between my knees since January.  This morning I woke up and realized I didn't use my little pillow at all.  I slept great (still on some meds) but no tossing and turning.  Woo Hoo! Life is starting to feel normal.  I am fully committed to getting both knees completely straight and although pt said their goal is 120 flexion my goal is 125 or better.  
If if you feel blocked and your pt is not driving results I recommend you meet with your surgeon to talk about options.  I also decided to only work with the physical therapist that really pushes me and tries new exercises.  The other girl was really nice but I had to go with my gut.  This journey has been the toughest thing I have ever had to face.  I finally see light at the end of the tunnel.  I'm hoping my story will give you a little more strength to get through yours.  Good luck.

"Back in winter of 2014-2015, my car was stuck in my driveway after some heavy snowfall.  I was getting pretty close to getting it out but just needed a little extra leverage, so while I was pressing the gas, I stuck my left foot out the doorway to do a little extra push.  It worked, at the price of injuring my knee.  The pain wasn't severe and after a few days the pain went away.  My injured leg didn't seem to function any worse than the good leg.  Since I don't exercise much during the winter, my leg got plenty of rest time.  By spring, I felt no pain at all (it would've gone away quicker if I didn't have to keep shoveling snow every other day).
Anyway fast forward a bit, any time I go for a walk that lasts longer than an hour, the pain comes back.  If I stop for about 10 minutes and start walking again, it feels much worse, to the point that it is almost crippling.  Hills and stairs seem to accelerate the problem, particularly when going down.  I only feel pain when extending my leg forward or when decelerating.  The pain is minimal when sitting or standing.  After about 2 days of not walking much, the pain goes away completely and I can walk normally again with no discernable difference to my other leg.
To my knowledge, the pain can be narrowed down to either the biceps femoris, or, the lateral collateral ligament.  I'm not really sure which it is.  There's a pretty small spot on the side of my knee I can press that expresses the soreness.
So - I can't tell how severe this injury is.  It's been over a year and it keeps ""haunting"" me, but my leg works just fine and the pain doesn't last long.

"Hi, i partially torn my ACL 4 and a half months ago. I spend month on a half on visits to doctor, MRI, puncture and after all this i was diagnosed with partially torn ACL based on MRI. Doctor/Orthopedist wasn't sure if i should undergo operation on my knee becuase i play sports very much and they make a big part of my life.
At the end he decided to avoid it but instead he said i need to work hard in the gym to strengthen my muscles around the knee and that i can try to come back to sports after 2-3 months. Now, 2 months and 11 days after that, i had one sprain in the meantime, i don't feel like i can play basketball. I played it today, and on one occassion i was pivoting and i felt that my knee almost gave up and i wasn't able to go past people, i was afraid to jump, go into crowd, i was afraid of contact, felt really depressed. On the other hand, when i play tennis, i played it yesterday, i feel great, i can run, maybe i am not so explosive but i can run from left to right from top to bottom, my footwork is ok, and i was feeling pretty good after that tennis match yesterday only to feel completely opposite today playing basketball.
And it made me think if i should have taken the operation way, i mean, if i was a professional player i would have undergone operation without a doubt, but since i am not, doctor decided to skip it, well, maybe i am not, but i very active sports guy, would it be easier if i undergo operation. What do you guys think, i have a meeting with a doctor in 3 weeks so i'll tell him all that for sure, but maybe you have some advice. Thanks in advance

He uses the Oxford Partial Knee and says it is the best one to go with. I was able to get a Synvisc injection on May 12, 2016. My doctor and I are both hopeful that this will give me some time to make this big decision. I have had a really hard time recovering from the microfracture surgery. I was on crutches for five weeks and my knee got stuck in a bent position. I was in therapy for three months and I still cannot walk with a straight knee.

"Hi
I have just been placed on the waiting list for total knee replacement of one knee. I have read a lot on here about people's experiences - much of it bad- but have done a lot of other research and have a fair idea of what to expect afterwards such as sleep problems, pain, swelling, but then have most of those now. Had a lot of swelling after arthroscopy so expecting that too. Am also a nurse so fairly realistic about things though that might all change when it's me going through it!
What I would like to ask is how did other people prepare for the surgery? Did you do any specific exercises pre op to strengthen muscles?, take any supplements or anything else that might help. I am already working on weight loss. Does it help to start the exercises I will need to do post op now? I live alone so also need to arrange help for afterwards. Should I think about buying things like bath seats and raised toilet seats or is that overkill and money I don't need to spend? All advice welcome. I am expecting surgery to be around August and will be 50 by then

"Had my athroscopy yesterday, 3rd op on same knee. I had a PKR January
2015 and after 6 months of physio, still had pain and using crutches.
X rays showed everything fine. I was feeling like no one believed me,
but I pushed for further investigation and my athroscopy showed
that I had soft tissue impinging on the joint which has now been
removed. Hurray !! I have such high hopes that I can now get my life back.
I must admit that I have felt so old before my time. This forum has been such a great
help to me. I don't know how I would have managed without it.
Thanks to all for reading my posts. Susan xx

"Hello all, 
I'm just wanting some advice regards to me knees. I have noticed that since I was about 16, every so often I've suffered from knee pain stiffness. I don't know if its due to a contribution of different factors or whether it's something else. Firstly, in the past few weeks I've been getting stiff knees/ slight pain (nothing I can't handle I just need to move around). In a lecture a couple of weeks ago I was countign down the minutes till the lecture ended so I could move my knee, I couldn't concentrate. It is exam time at the moment so I'm sat at my desk for a considerable amount of time, but arent most students? I ackowledge probably be a factor though
2 years ago, I was playing football, someone collided with me, it felt like my knee popped or something, and I had to have crutches for about 2 days as I couldn't apply much weight and it was swollen. A couple of months before that, during the first week of uni, I was dancing, being a typical drunk 'fresher' and suddenly it felt like my knee just twisted and I felll. When I was 18 (this would have been like a year before i started uni) similar to the lecture scenario, I went watching Michael Mcyntire and my knee was incredibly stiff. I kept having to stand up every so often, which probably made me look very odd and I;m guessing the people behind me weren't to happy haha. 
I'm not trying to make this a bigger deal than it is, it's like it comes and go's. Before the past few weeks, I have not really had any problems, I notice the odd bit of stiffness every now and again but thats it. Basically, I would very much appreictae some advice. Have my knees just had some bad luck, like the football injury (I'm pretty sure it happened while playing football when I was about 15'16 but im not fully certain) and other factors. Or do you think its worth getting it checked out?

"OK I've unraveled a bit, the sleep is intolerable, talk about bags under the eyes, can't even really blame it totally on the pain, albeit the pain is always  lurking about, one false move and it will give me hell. Just seem to be overthinking, worrying about the future, worrying I can't bear weight to walk properly on the knee, etc etc, I have had 1 hr in total last night! On the plus side I have managed to still work through my physio sheet of exercises, I.e. Heel to buttock slider, Oh the agony! The dreaded knee bend, and the flexing.the latter feels quite good! CAn maintain a 100 second unaided stand, and keep pottering on both sticks around the block, and house, a good few times a day! The leg raise is extremely poor, although it can be done, it has left me with a very painful inner knee! God almighty what a palaver this is, loss of dignity, looks, hair cleaning, house going to pot! TKR you'd better be worth it,  it would be too hard to bear to go through this without THE RESULT! lots of tears and irritability yesterday, really had to get a grip today, as sometimes feel as if I'm losing it!

"I went to see a rheumatologist today regarding, y fibromyalgia and polymyalgia. She looked at the xrays and mri scar report which my orthopaedic surgeon had done. The mri report said that there was a lot of debris and damage as well as a left sided meniscus tear. Will the tear be making my knee even more painful? My surgeon has been on study leave and hasn't yet seen the report so I'm waiting for him to look at the report and arrange for another appointment where he will hopefully list me for a tkr. I spoke to the waiting list lady who told me that it's currenly about 6 months wait due to bed issues at Christmas and the doctors strikes. I think it will be at least Christmas before I get my op, goodness knows how I'm going to manage until then as I'm in such horrible pain and it's really affecting my quality of life.

"I had total knee replacement surgery 10 days ago.  It is very difficult sleeping.  I have read other discussions on this painful surgery and hopefully it will be better soon.  The best thing I have found is a ice therapy machine (I think it is called a cyriotherapy machine) which you fill with ice and water.  It has a sleeve that you velcro on and the machine pumps ice water through it. You can rent them but we bought ours since I need the other knee done too.  I sleep with it on and it helps a lot.  
It seems like I cant bend my knee much without it feeling like the stitches are going to pop.  I cant sleep on my side because it causes more pain.

"Latest Blog from my TKR hope I'm going to learn (in time) to love it, the jury's out at the moment!  Historically both knees are bone on bone, the right knee apparently, made the radiographer gasp when she saw the X Ray, a month ago, she was amazed I was walking on the drafted thing, and though I must be in agony, mmmmm. Wasn't agony painful yes!  This recovery is in my book agony! Moving on had TKR right knee on 5th May, spinal block, plenty of sedative, can honestly say, that was the easy bit, thought I was pretty great until back in room started with the most severe vomiting and disorientation ever! Lost 1 day of movement as totally incapacitated, guess my body doesn't tolerate morphine based drugs too well. Hobbled about on crutches in room, bed pans etc managed to wash myself, got down to paracetamol and ibuprofen pain killers, until day 4 release day I know make it sound like prison, it wasn't the staff were flipping great! The day dawned of hopefully coming home, but I had to reach certain criteria, I.e. Stairs, walking and able to wash and dress myself aid of the crutches, and YIPPEE the dreaded 75 degree bend, and yes I did it, sweating and inwardly cursing but I did it!  Home and a loving husband (my rock) my heart goes out to fellow patients who do not have this gift from God! He has watched me bawl, curse, radiate supreme happiness, as I achieve heel to buttock stretches, manage to hobble about the house, still with crutches, keep the bend going, and my latest success story to date, was a minute leg raise this morning, this I have not been able to do until day 7' so going to work on this! Night time is a true curse, that seems to be universal with TKR 2 hrs and then awake, sweating, pain, getting up to spend a penny etc. Helpful tips are, be prepared for sickness and any intolerance to painkillers, think I was a bit of an exception, keep those bowels moving, plenty of stool softeners, look after your skin before, you have surgery, any little nicks scratches etc can be a source of infection

"I am in week 5 post op.  When I first came out I had two consecutive visits from OT and could achieve some bend in my knee.   I was never measured and since joining this site this week have learned how.   Although my recovery is fairly good judging by most of you.   How can I redress the balance and work on achieving a better bend.
I have learnt more from this site than from any of the professionals involved and I am dissapointed with the lack of OT support.  
I go for my 6 wk check this Friday and have made a list of issues I wish to tackle - e.g how do I access OT support, should I buy a static bike?
I havent got loads of money so I have to be careful where I spend.

Anyway i went to my gp today as physio said i shouldnt go back to work as i wasnt ready. I had a great discussion with him about my walking etc. He said as a gp they have to work out whats best for me my physical health versus my mental health of being off work stil at 12 wks! He so knew exactly how low i was and how im needing my normal life! So im off for just 2 more wks to be sensible but in that time im definately walking unaided and going back to work the day after the bank holiday ! Who would of thought before we had this major op we would find it so invasive in ever aspect of our lives! Thank god for an understanding and patient dr who helped me today!

My peace of advice for all of you, don't go for tkr if you really wanna go. Then only do one tkr at one time. Also if you have weak stomach do not go for operation at all.
These all things lead to my mother death.
Please pray for her.
Thank you.

My query is, have people worked with two physio sand two plans? Will one contradict the other and which should I give priority to? Any suggestions very welcome.

She refused to eat, her electrolytes went down sodium is at 111. Every other report like heart/stool/etc are all fine. Doctors said its due to loose motions of 8 weeks.

"Hello all, I am 72 and like many of you have had a TKR and suffered with pain and still am, I  was wondering if it all happens at bedtime to you all, I ask this because that’s what I have had to put up with in the last 6 weeks. Excruciating pain in bed, I had my operation 6 weeks today 09/05/16 and up until last night 08/05/16 I could not sleep at night and can tell you all why we have all suffered in this way.
As you all know when we go to bed our bodies sink into the mattress which is normal and lovely for a good night’s sleep but it’s not  good if you have had a TKR, this is because when the body  sinks into the mattress the nerves stretch and gives us the terrible pain.
Well last night I decided to try a different bed to sleep in and can tell you all that it’s the best night’s sleep I have had in the last six weeks by doing the following.
I got a duvet and folded it in half, laid in on the bedroom floor / carpet, put two pillows against the skirting board and a few more on the side of me in case I needed them, laid on the duvet, put a pillow between my knees, duvet over me and slept all night without any pain, got up once to use the loo, this morning I am fresh and happy as Larry
If you are one that is suffering pain from a TKR I suggest you take your meds and try it for a pain free good night’s sleep, worth giving up the bed for.
If you try it please come back and tell us all how you got on

My Phyco Physical therapist (lol) had me on the bike on Wednesday & again today. I can only pedal half way around in both directions. I can straighten my knee completely with no pain. Did leg lifts with 2lbs weight bags on ankle today.
I know that everyone seems VERY AGGRESSIVE with the way they push us to get to full range of motion. I am Bending at 100 with alot of pain on both sides of my knee.
I still have swelling & stiffness most of the time. I get my stitches out on Thursday the 12th.
I understood that AGGRESSIVE is the new way to approach Physical therapy. But I know my body & it's limitations. So when I feel as though I can pish, I do. When I think I am overdoing it, I pull back.
I am a semi pro Bowler, and I would love to be back to bowling as soon as PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE, without causing additional injury to myself.
But i was wondering, does anyone else feel as though the way they rush you home the day of your surgery, physical therapy at the Hospital b4 I went home , Physical therapy 2 days after surgery then 3x a wk. After that, may be a bit Too AGGRESSIVE ? Just wondering if I am alone in my thinking.

"Thanks to everyone who responds to the questions asked. I am 8 days PO from my PKR.
Trying to be patient with my recovery and not push too hard. I do notice improvements more and more each day.
The past two nights, have been horrible, with no sleep in sight. Knee aching even through the ice packs & meds.
I am going to try a hot shower right before I go down for the night.
Doctor changed my pain meds trying to find something that works for the pain.
Hopefully I can sleep tonight, and good luck to all of you.
I look forward to our chats back & forth.
BLESSINGS & Hugs

Any one else around my age? Would love to hear ur experiences.

I'm not some kind of mega clean person but husband said housework is not his priority and feed up at looking at the mess. Also he doesn't get in from work until sometimes 9pm at night including weekends so we are all starving by then and too late for him to cook. Not my choice but something I need to do. At least I haven't returned to work also.

I drove at the wknd and it feels odd but im ok to use the clutch! Im walking unaided round the house and garden and have been out without my crutch! But when i walk to far i really woddle and limp! From other peoples experiences is that the same for you? Do you think using a stick would give me balance and help with the woddling! Also do you think i wont be helping my healing by doing this! Im desperately trying to be ok to go back to work at 12 wks which is only 2 wks time! I need to really improve my walking technique by then! Any tips? Im working hard with my physio exercises!

"Hi. A weird anniversay just now, one year on from my TKR. It has been quite a journey and having read recent posts on here I can say that the first six or seven months were plagued by tiredness and fatigue. I had poor flexion of only 65% to 70% for some time after the operation and underwent a manual manipulation too. However, in time the thing has slowly improved. I now have 90% flexion and of course arthritis pain disappeared from day one! The fatigue bit has gone now. I take co-codamol twice per day and occasional naproxen, but the latter is more to do with my other leg which will require a TKR in a few months' time! I'd just say that I don't regret the operation. I'll never have full movement and going down some flights of stairs can be difficult but this too is partly due to the pain in my other leg. I'd urge anyone feeling low to hang on in there. I was disappointed and downhearted after six months but it does get better! Good luck to all.

I was going to ask for a stick for balance as i woddle a bit. But the physio said i shouldnt give up my crutch yet. He said im not walking with a flexible leg and am holding it stiff. I know i am! So i wil do more damage he even questioned wether i should be walking round house without it! I feel a bit upset as was hoping i was doing well. Got to take their advice!
I was hoping to go back to work in 2 wks which wil make it wk 13 but he said how long was i walking for and i said 20 mins so he said i wouldnt be ready to be on my feet for a shift! Im trying to build my walking up but he has got a point! Hopefully will only need another 2 wks and then phased return.
I wont be able to go back if i cant walk without crutch. Im at physio in 2 wks so will see how im doing then. I will persevere with walking and exercises and see how i go! This is so hard at 49 i want to be living! Sorry to moan but feeling frustrated and disappointed .com lol

"Hi! 
so i had ACL reconstruction 9 years ago and my knee has never been the same, alot of pain, locking in my knee etc. Have been back to the surgeon numerous times and to PT 4 times and was told that is normal and I am going to have to live with my knee like that. I decided to go to someone else recently to see if they have another opinion. Ran and MRI and x-ray both normal. They sent me to Pt, and since my knee has gotten a lot worse. The doctor just gave me a cortisone shot 4 days ago and since the shot I have had a terrible pain at the head of my tibia. It feels like someone is driving a screw driver into it. (this area has always been pretty sensitive since my surgery). I am writing to see if anyone has any insight as to whats going on with my knee and all and also to see if this tibia pain is something I need to call the doctor about ASAP.

"Hi, it's been a few weeks since i've posted on this site so i thought i'd just give you an update on how thing are going for me.  I'm 16 weeks post op and started back into phased work 2 wks ago. Everything is going well, I still have a lot of stiffness but have been told that this should get better by about 6 - 8 months post op.  Just before going back into work i started experiencing pain in the sole and heel of my foot, some days i could hardly put any weight on it but i found out that if you fill an old squash or pop bottle with water and freeze it you can then roll your foot back and fore over the bottle and this greatly reduces the pain, i just thought i'd share this in case anyone else has the same problem.  As so many people have talked about  the recovery from this op  is so long and you really feel you will never get back to fitness, but with a lot, and i mean a lot of patience and PT you will come out on the other side and the feeling of walking pain free is wonderful.  I wish you all a full recovery and i hope i'll be able to post again in a few months with another update.
Take care

10 weeks post op TKR on right knee and lately have been having the most awful pain in my lower back on the right side.
This morning around 5am went in the kitchen for a walk round because I couldn't sleep due to pain and discomfort and the pain in my back was gushing. I had to sit down and rest. Today I felt weak and have flu like symptoms.
I would never go into this so lightly ever again. I never thought I would end up like this. I think they discharge you too early from these NHS Choose and book private hospitals. 3 days and you're practically thrown out. Any problems go to A&E or your own GP.

"The other day while doing squats bare footed the usual happened, my knees caved in. My friend Lulu one of the trainers at BVM Crossfit noticed that my feet were caving in just before my knee. I did toe raises in front of a mirror and found that it all started with my feet, then my ankles then my knee all caving in in sequence. Up to that point I never thought about my feet and the foundation they provide. I walk, I run, I lift, I skate all without any thought at all about my feet and the vital part they play in the structure that is my body. It is kind of like building the prefect race car then putting square wheels on it, no matter how strong the engine or how advanced the suspension the car will never run at its best until the problem with the tires is fixed.  Power, strength and mobility comes from being able to properly stack my bones and fire the right muscles in the right order. I have always been able to use the big muscles to power my way through almost any lift and at some cost, my form sucked but I could power my way through. As I age, I am starting to see that form and small muscles are the key to injury free strength training, it starts with my feet. Doing specific foot exercises to give me the foundation to lift and live injury free is my new obsession. I am a speed skater my speed skates give me little to no ankle support so I skate on the inside edge (pronate). I always believed that it was weak ankles now I am beginning to see that it might be weakness in my feet. I think my skating will improve and some of my knee pain will go away when my feet are aligned properly, kept aligned during the full range of motion and as strong as the rest of my body.

"Hello all!
Approximately a year and a half ago, I sustained a knee injury whereby I fell directly upon my bent knee and bruised it quite badly. It hurt really badly at the time, but I thought that I could tough it out, so I didn't see anybody. Fast forward 6 months, and it still hurt pretty badly, so I consulted my doctor, and he took an MRI. The MRI revealed that my bursa had been fragmented. After having diagnosed me, he sent me on my merry way, telling me to take painkillers if it bothered me furthermore. As I live a relatively active lifestyle, it troubled me that whenever I would run, I would experience a considerable amount of pain on the top of my kneecap that would sometimes also hurt the lateral parts of the knee. I recently began seeing another doctor, and he confirmed the first doctor's suspicions and decided to give me a cortisone injection. The pain was alleviated at first, but it is still prevalent in the top of my kneecap and sometimes on the sides.
I'm really tired of living with this pain. Does anybody know what the actual origin of it could be and ways to get rid of it? Thanks in advance.

and except for a few good days at the beginning which must have been to do with the anaesthetic- I have slowly deteriorated- this morning I went to Marks and Spencer and had to use a crutch. Bought one thing and had to go and sit down in their cafe feeling really poorly. It's pointless going to my own doctor because he just wants a to send me to A&E which are practically closed and all they want to do is X-Ray the knee - what for??
I had it done NHS Direct at a private hospital and of course their attitude is also go to your own doctor or A&E.

I have been reading and visiting forums were people talk about their experience and frankly I am very scare after reading some of the situations in this forum. I still work as a Bus driver and I am getting concern that after the operation I may have to give it away that is due to the length that it seem for you all to recover ??? My surgeon said that it may take 6-8 weeks to get going. I think I need to have more contact with members of this group which had this both knees replaced a year ago. I certanly need more encoragement. Love to hear from you all guys. Best regards Clem

I had my TKR on the 6th January and was doing great, at 7wks my knee was
nearly straight and my bend was 105. Saw my physiotherapist and she told
me my kneecap was stuck and since this happened my knee is perfectly
straight but my bend has deteriorated to 68.
He said that if he can't manipulate the kneecap loose he will have to open
up the knee to release it. So another little setback, but I will come out on top .

"Great info n very supportive. I'm in tkr 5 weeks now. I try to walk down the block every day even though it feels awkward. Knee just doesn't want to bend the way it should through normal walking. Been having trouble with bending the knee, up to  80-90degrees, depending on inflammation.  I've gotten a few apps for positive reinforcement n relaxation. I have a lot of anxiety when going to pt, due to previous almost intolerable pain forcing knee to bend.. I've read a lot about passive vs aggressive ROM.  So my new somewhat adjusted attitude helps. But still have that little gremlin in the back of my head who is not so encouraging. I do my exercises daily but think I may speak to my therapist about this other type of therapy. I know the aggressive initial therapy brought me to this point of tensing n fear of therapy. Found some good info from SBFPHC site. Showed me I'm not the only one in this boat. Anyone else going thru this type of tension n fear of not getting to where I think I should be. My therapist says I have a low tolerance for pain. I tend not to agree with her.... I KNOW my pt is painful when pushed to its limits.

"I had a left TKR on 21/01/2016 and has been doing well until last week when I developed pain below the knee close to the inside of my leg.  The pain is excruciating when I lift my leg off the floor when walking or even when I am sitting and try to lift my foot off the floor.  Standing for any period of time is difficult and when I start walking after standing even for a few minutes it is pure agony.  My pt gave me excersises for a pinched nerve in my lower back that invloves bending my upper body forward and letting my harms hang towards the floor.  The moment I bend over the pain kills me and I have to stop.  It almost feels like the pain I had before the TKR but far worse.  I have been using my TENS for the past three days, elevated the leg, iced etc. but the swelling isn't going down and the pain is not getting better.  Has anybody experienced something similar?

Before op l would go onto my stomach hands on either side of bath and pull up onto my knees painful but it worked, well this was not going to work l did try but l had to roll bk. I now started to hyperventilate and panic,l called for hubby he was pleased to see l had managed to get in but then realised l was near to tears, l can't  get out l cried. Hubby suggested right let's try this no good, then that no good, l was now really crying and so angry that because l so wanted a bath l had caused this.By now l was convinced the fire brigade would need to be called as l was not going to get out without help. My dear hubby although 75 has always done physical labour and only a few months ago was repairing our roof suggested l do as he asks and he would get me out.The bath water was let out and a big bath towel was put under me giving me grip on the bottom of the bath,l was told to clasp my hands around his neck and don't let go just allow him to do the rest.he somehow placed his hand across the bath and used his body as a hoist and started to lift me, with this l was able to push up with my old leg and help him till l was sitting on the side of the bath.PHEW what a nightmare, l promised him no more baths my poor hubby. Well at 65 you would think l would have some sense it seems where my body is concerned l  am destined to learn the hard way.

I have hardly any strength in my hands, I get dizzy very easily and feel like I'm going to pass out, my heart starts pounding really fast and my ears have been ringing. Physical therapy has been a nightmare, I cannot do straight leg lifts because it hurts too much inside my knee to do them right now. I haven't hardly been out of bed in 2 days because I'm afraid I'll pass out. My eating habits haven't been good since my surgery. Some days I have an appetite and some days I dont. Is any of this normal? Will I be ok or are things going wrong?

"Surgeons make an effort to ""balance"" the knee at the time of surgery. This means finding the proper size and alignment of the knee replacement so that the knee joint is not too tight, and not too loose, and so this balancing is the same with the knee straight and bent. This is precisely why a knee replacement is a difficult procedure, and the art of perfecting this takes many years. Errors in positioning of the implants at the time of surgery may not be apparent on the operating table, and can cause difficulty bending or straightening the knee.

"Hi, please share how you controlled your knee pain prior to surgery?  I'm taking Tramadol during the day, sometimes 100 mg and 1000 mg Tylenol.  At bedtime I take 2 Lortab.  Also, use an icepack at night.  Just moving the slitest bit can send a shockwave of pain...so sharp I'm whimpering.  Yep, It's pretty bad.  Cortisone did nothing to alleviate the pain.  Please share your experience.  Thanks!

"The doctor said we'd do two seperate operations, five days apart. One to recontruct the PCL and knee cap, and one to fix the others. He told me I'd be on crutches for almost 14 weeks, but didn't give me a final recovery date. I've torn my ACL before, and the total recovey took 7 months. I'm just a high school student, and I'm very involved in school and travel athletics. How long do you think it will take before I'm back out on the feild?

"Hi everyone!  I'm new to the forum and looking for answers, advice and support.  I have a connective tissue disorder called Marfan Syndrome.  My left knee was reconstructed 40 years ago.  I was told it was bone on bone about 10 years ago and was put in $$$$ knee brace.  My right knee was also braced because of hypermobility.  I started having knee pain (left knee) over a month ago and it got progressively worse to the point I had to get crutches.  Over a week ago I received a cortisone shot and it did not help at all.  I have pain even at rest.  The worse pain is on a scale of about 100....it's like a knife and it sends me into orbit.  Has my knee reached the end of its mileage?  How do I get through this pain?  I appreciate any input.  Thanks!

"Had TKR on 13/2/16 with NHS direct in a private hospital.
Last 9 weeks have been a nightmare from torturous pain and sleep deprivation- also family members seem to think I should be better after 6 weeks so there's little sympathy there!!
I go to a physio class once a week. You get six of them free on the NHS but to be honest I have been so worn out from it all that my home physio has been a bit lax. I feel if I stand on a box at home I could fall off it. A few behind tge chair crouches etc and stretches in bed is all I've been able to manage.
The surgeon said I could drive at 4 weeks but I think that has done something to my foot.
No way would I go with NHS in a private hospital again. They throw you out too early and they're not interested in any problems you may have.
I said to the surgeon could he X-ray my foot when he does my knee but he refused and gave me the impression I would have to go to my GP. He was all for it when I complained about my lower back being painful which I think is a result of all the medication- probably need a new hip he said. But there was nothing wrong with my hip before I had this op. Well he said your body is probably full of arthritis- no it's not I thought. What's this all about??

"I finally made it to the top of Glastonbury Tor, last Thursday, on the Queens 90th birthday! - did about 6 miles in total, both uphill & downhill. The next day the knee was stiff, but not swollen or painful.
So - I am taking a break now from the forum. I have found in so helpful & a real help through my journey of the primary TKR, the year of pain waiting for the misaligned, mechanically loose prosthesis to be taken out & replaced, - the revision one year to the day last October, & then the slow recovery.
I'm now 6 months post revision,  & feel if I am to move on, I need to try & think of other things (happier ones!!). I feel as if I know so many of you, & really, really appreciate all the contact in those dark months. I hope we all get there in the end! I'm still battling with stiffness, but not pain, so I can cope - & if it takes 2 years, then so be it, but like someone else said on this forum, the left knee will have to be hanging off it's hinges before anyone can get near it!!
Good luck to you all - Veronica

"I am a 43 year old male and have been experiencing knee pain for about 5 months now. I didn't really notice something was wrong until December last year when I started going on long country walks and after walkling a mile or two, a mild pain started to develop in my right knee, which gradually got worse the more I walked.
I would say the pain feels like it's coming from under the knee cap close to the surface of the skin. It's definitely not coming from within the knee bone. I find after sitting down the pain eventually goes away. I can walk fine and don't have any other pain in either knee in general day to day activites. It's only when I start walking long distances that the pain in my right knee comes on.
My health in general is good and don't suffer from any health issues. I wanted to see if the knee would improve over the 5 months or go back to normal but it hasn't and has stayed the same since December.
Could anyone give me an idea what might be causing this? I have not seen a doctor yet but will now make an appointment first thing Monday morning.

Several weeks ago, I went outside to work out. I ran sprints, did ball touches, and played a little soccer (just shooting/etc. - no contact!). At no point did I twist wrong or hurt myself. Nothing. I was just fine.
Now several weeks later, I have this annoying medial pain on my left knee. The strange thing is, I have full range of motion, no tightness whatsoever, and no catching or locking. I can run around fine - just a little bit of pain on that one spot. 
I've never had anything like this. Any ideas of what it could be?

"Hello,  I am a firefighter that was injured on the job about 2 months ago.  I had my leg wrapped up with a large diameter hose that was pulled forcibly causing a twisting motion.  I felt a pop and pain radiated through my knee and leg. I stayed in a standing position the entire time but shifted my weight to my unhurt leg after the intial injury.  The leg and knee felt weak and I had trouble walking up any inclines.  I went to the ER and they did X-rays and found nothing broken.  They referred my to a occupation therapist.  I iced the knee, with compression, elevation and Ibuprofen for a couple days before the appointment.  The day of the appointment it was feeling much better, I was able to do the movements in the appointment with little pain and a small amount of swelling.  I was cleared to go back to work.  I had a hint of trouble when leaving the appointment, I tried to walk down some stairs and it was difficult and painful.  Going up not much problem just going down.  I was on an EMS call a couple days later and had to walk up some stairs to a 2nd floor apartment,  I needed to carry approximately 6o - 70 lbs of equipment up the stairs but almost couldn't because of the intense pain that shot through my knee.  I saw my doctor who stated it was a ligament strain that would take months to heal.  I have had some improvement in the knee but I have found when I pull on my leg such as from tripping or catching my foot on something I have that intense pain that shoots through my knee with weakness in my leg.  This is followed up with immediate swelling.  My question is do I just keep using the RICE method or do I need to see a specialist.  Is this normal for a ligament sprain?

"Hi I'm 27 years old I got a TKR 5 years ago because I got a bone tumor and after 2 surgeries doctors decided it was Better for me to get a TKR and I they proceeded, but they didn't make a conventional TKR surgery cause they ripped off some muscle and other tissue in order to get rid of the tumor cells and prevent rejection from my body to the new prosthesis which was the one in the market with the longest stems for a person my size. A month ago I visited a new doctor cause I was having pain every day all day long. And after looking a first set of X-rays he told Me my prosthesis was probably dislocated I asked him what the treatment was and he told that most likely amputation because there was no other prosthesis to get because of the length of my stems. Is that true? I have no trouble with it my father has only one leg since I am 10 and I know how it is to live with one leg but I wanted to know if it was my only option.. Thanks

"Today I had a lengthy appointment with the surgeon who took out the faulty, misaligned painful TKR, & replaced it with one I can live with. I am over 5 months now, & my only problems are stiffness when walking & standing. He had a lovely lady with him, who had been a trained physiotherapist before going back to University & training as 1st a doctor, then a surgeon (also orthapedics). My whole problems are due to the quads. I couldn't move that leg for a whole year the 1st time around. She explained the swellings on my knee are not fluid, but fatty ""pads"" the body has produced to protect the knee, & to learn to live with them, as this is now the new shape of my knee! She also taught me (very effective) short excercises that although to start with will tear tiny muscles, & make the leg ache, eventually, the quads will build up & (almost) get back to normal. I totally trust & believe both of them. I see the consultant again in 6 months, where hopefully, I will be back to ""me"" again, as I really am going to work on those muscles!

"My brother is in need of knee replacement surgery. He lives in New Mexico and returning home to North Carolina I May 2015. He was told years ago that he needed both knees replaced but did not have insurance He is now covered by Medicare and AARP insurance. He has dealt with the overweight issue by going through Gastric bypass surgery losing over one hundred pounds. Losing the weight has led to an excess skin problem estimated to be 50 to 75 pounds putting him at about 300 pounds.
This has created a “catch 22” situation in that he needs to lose the weight to have the surgery and he needs to have the surgery so he can lose the weight!
He gets around with a cane, but seriously needs the knee surgery as soon as he can. He will be living back home in eastern North Carolina beginning in May.
Has anyone in this forum ever had Knee Replacement surgery while overweight?

"If your 8 weeks post op then I would like to know if you're at the same stage as me.
Although my knee bend is109 - I'm suffering with so much pain that I think I've pulled a muscle!! I can't help it in the night stretching my leg without being able to control it and then if it stretches all the way I get the most awful pain that makes me cry out!!
I think I started driving too quickly at 4 weeks post op.
I had my op on the 13th Feb so that makes me 8 weeks post op today and sometimes I think I wish I never had it done.
It's been the most awful 8 weeks of my life. I never expected this.
I knew there would be pain but I can't seem to control it and I never know what I will be like the next day.
I go to a physio class one a week and then I've been to a private physio the last three weeks but in trying to help the muscle which she says is tight at the back of my leg- I feel she makes it worse - I couldn't walk yesterday.
That's what I mean - somedays I can walk unaided - other days I'm hobbling.

"I have been diagnosed with a torn meniscus in one knee and and I am waiting for a referral for physiotherapy.My hospital has a 3 month waiting list which means that I won't get an appointment to at least July and I see my consultant again at the end of July which won't give me much time to see if the physiotherapy is helping or not.The hospital will not give me a cortisone injection but I think I might be able to get one at my doctors surgery.Most nights in bed I am in a lot of pain especially In my leg just above my knee.I don't know why but some times it can be unbearable but it goes off again when I get up but I generally repeat this most nights.Any tips would be grateful.I may be going to have an arthroscopy but this could be discussed more at my next appointment.I have been told that this is generally done as a day patient and that I should be able to walk straight away and it takes a couple of weeks to recover.Is this information correct ?

Did I get injected with a long term pain relief or what ?
I am not happy with the post-op support - I was introduced to ""my"" physio - pre-op who showed me how to use the crutches - not post op !!
No further appts have been made with physio - is this correct ?

Using exercise bike for hald an hour daily and when I feel stiff get on the bike for 5 minutes which seems to help.
Do all exercises faithfully around twice a day.

"Hi everyone,well l made it through my first wk shift in one peice,for those that don't know me l work in the community looking after people in their own homes a job l have done for the past 25 yrs,since my TNR l have had to work out a new regime to accommodate my new knee.My shifts are a 3 day week from 6.45 till approx 5.,took advice from everyone who knew l was returning to work unfortunately l was not really able to elevate at all during the day as l work back to back.In light of the new regime l have had to start my day differently,l rise at 5 after a usually disturbed sleep as l am still waking many times during the night l start by doing some stretching,and lunging exercises l use weights to make it harder,then l go on my exercise bike for 5 mins then repeat lunging and stretching, by this time l get showerd breakfast then out the door. My first day was full on and l was shattered so much so that within an hr of arriving home after a meal and bath l was in bed,second day was better l used every opportunity to stretch and lunge, and today my third day was good ,l feel very pleased with how it went,but of course everything is different now and without me starting the day the new way l would be as stiff as a board.So for all those who are concerned about the Work word don't be if l can do it than we all can,l still have discomfort pain ,stiffness and am very sore but l realise it takes a long time.l now have 4 days off before l start work again.l had dreaded so much returning l was so worried that l would not be able to get through that now l have a feel proud,after all l am now 65 .

"I felt my knee ""pop"" about 8 weeks ago. Had an MRI shown a lot of arthritis and small tear in meniscus, ruptured baker's cycst. Been doing a lot of home self  physical therapy and using many lotions, potions, creams and supplements. Been to chiropractor, doctor, ortho surgeon. chiropractor said I will have to have surgery, surgeon wants to do orthoscopic surgery, doc said it might heal on its own. It is better, lots better and not better and better throughout the day. Through all the physio I do at home I can extend it and bend it. Got rid of cane. But it still is not good off and on. Any experience, strength and hope would be so welcome. All kinds of feedback results from orthroscopic surgery. I am also overweight and working on that. But my life style is being affected which I can stand if I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Seems knee still swollen or something as it is rather soft bumpy around the knee. Other things going on with it? Thanks for any thoughts of feedback....

"Hello,
i am in my 20s. I had an acl surgery in october 2015, and lysis of adhesion for arthrofibrosis plus manipulation in January 2016. At the second surgery, the surgeon was still not able to achieve full extension. I was missing 5 degrees. he could have done posterior capsular release but felt it was unnecessary b/c he thought it wasn't worth it just to get 5 more degrees.
Now, we are in April, and i am missing at least 10 degrees of extension, and my bending isn't perfect either. I cannot walk smoothly. My knee feels wrong with every step. walking for more than 10mins is almost impossible b/c my knee will hurt so much. even when walking around the house my knee feels wrong and bent.
What should i do? has anyone had a failed lysis of adhesions? has anyone had capsular release? i am feeling very depressed and im sobbing every night b/c i recently got a career job (and they're hard to find for recent graduates), but i may have to quit it if i get another surgery. Please, give me any advise, i want to have a normal life again

"Hi all im 8 weeks post op of left tkr today! I have a lot of swelling on outside of knee in the area that is numb. It seemed to go down last wk but has swelled again. I ice regularly about 4 times a day. I went to physio today and they said they think its a pulled or swollen tendon where tendon joins muscle. I was wondering if this is a common problem? I am working very hard on my bend as this is what iv struggled with it was 77 when i was measured 3 wks ago and it was 86 today! I do bending exercises loads so had hoped for 90 today. The physio said bend could be better! Im going to try even more as iv got appt with surgeon 2 wks today! Any advice would be appreciated!
Im going to try to be confident enough to walk upstairs bending knee to do one foot on each step! Do you think this will help?
I did feel upset today as 2 men were only 5 wks and were chatting and saying they both had over 100""at bend and were walking unaided! Im finding it so much harder and i know i am trying my best! I did have a cry! Silly me! Thanks for any opinions! Hope i can sleep better tonight ! It helps !

"Hi! I have an ACL ligament tear in my left knee. This happened about five years ago. I was on waiting list & got a call to do surgery, but then I got pregnant, so I had to go back on waiting list. It must be a long list because I am still waiting. They have looked at it again because of the soreness around the knee when I walk. My doctor told me I have mild arthritis in my left knee now, but can still go through surgery.
This past week, I was in a situation where I didn't do much walking, laid around for most of day. I didn't have a pillow to use for my knee to be propped up, so I just used my right leg or had my left leg on its side when I laid down on my left side. I don't feeling anything around my knee now. It is numb! Would anyone know what is wrong? I tried to apply ice to it, but I can't feel it. I still can walk ok, though. Thanks!

"wow,
i am am so amazed at all the people on here that say they had no idea, the pain they would endure, how difficult it would be....work involved in restoring knee bend and that you would have sleepless nights.  I am thankful for the book and video prior to surgery from my ortho doc.  It spelled it all out, but I am certainly learning new stuff daily.  
This is discussion board is a heaven send.  Knowing others feel the same way is helpful.  I think it is hard for someone who has not gone thru this to begin to understand the frustration, depression, and sleeplessness.  And they fuel each other as we all know.
lets keep holding each other up and helping each other.

"Hello all,
Three weeks ago I had a fall rock climbing, landed funny on my knee from 4 meters...  a trip to A&E confirmed no fractures, was given a splint, crutches and referred to trauma & orthopeadics team there.
I had a horrible experience with my consultant, who suspected an ACL tear (though I only discovered this because he wrote it on the MRI referral form) and told I would get an MRI in 6/8 weeks.  
I elected to pay for a private scan, as I simply couldnt' wait that long, plus another couple of weeks to see my consultant.  I (used to) work three manual jobs, am a single mum and do some sort of exercise pretty much every day of the week so being suddenly laid up is depressing to say the least. 
To consultants credit, he was entirely correct in his diagnosis - however, I took my radiology report to my GP instead and asked to be referred to another hospital.
Apparently this was all pointless - I read stories from people in the states who from confirmation of their diagnosis are operated on within a couple of weeks.  I had an urgent ""must be seen in a week"" referral from GP to new hospital, who now, at 8 days claim to not have any record of my referral.  
I still can't walk properly, or bend my knee. I am only 30, and its making me so depressed.  I can't afford to see a private consultant, but I feel so let down with our system right now.  
So has anyone else here had a sports injury to their knee?  How long did you find the process from diagnosis - treatment?
It's not even about not being able to do sport, I just want to be able to walk and climb stairs and work!

"Hello and thanks for looking at my post. I have a follow up visit with my knee doctor in 2 weeks but received a copy of the MRI report today. I had both knees scanned and am hoping someone here can help me understand it better.
I'm 49 and was walking when I felt a sharp pain in my right knee. I shifted all my weight to left leg resulting in sharper pain in left knee. Both knees have been swollen for past 3 weeks.
Report for right knee: Horizontal tear within the mid body and posterior limb of the medial miniscus. Anterior limb is intact. Joint space is narrowed and the articular cartilages are narrowed particularly on the femoral condyle.
Report for left knee: Area of high signal within the articular cartilage of the medial facet of the patellofemoral compartment. No subchondral edema. Lateral miniscus shows foreshortening of its free edge of the mid body.
Any translation into laymans language would be appreciated. A two week wait for doctor visit to translate the report has me pretty anxious.
Thank you again for looking at my post!

"I Am waiting for an mri scan of my knee as I have been taking oral steroids for over a year and they can cause problems within the vessels I have been told.and the surgeon doesn't want to go in blind. I was told the waiting list for the scan was four to six weeks and it's been over four weeks so far so hopefully not much longer to wait. I don't know how long I'll wait to see the consultant after the scan to discuss the results but it will probably be may at this rate!
The thing is that I'm in agony when I walk or stand for more than four or five minutes so I'm almost housebound. I'm going to have to swallow my pride and sit in a wheelchair when we go out. I'm""only"" 56 and feel too young for this. The last few weeks have been very difficult for me and I spent almost every day in tears. I finally went to my gp surgery yesterday and poured my heart out to the lovely locum doctor who actually listened to me. (My original gp sadly died just before Christmas and since then I haven't seen the same doctor twice) She offered to refer me to a rheumatologist (I have been asking for this for the last 12 months) as I have fibromyalgia and Polymyalgia as she doesn't want me to have surgery if it's either of these conditions causing the pain. I don't think this is the case but I'm sure that the rheumatologist could help mewith both problems.
she also gave me antidepressants which I have had previously so hopefully I should be less tearful in a few weeks. Did any of you folks feel depressed whilst waiting for surgery? I've read many posts where you've been depressed after surgery due to the pain and poor outcomes.
Thanks for reading my tale of woe, take care, Deb

"I am a 20 year old female who has never had a knee injury or problem. Two weeks ago, I fell from about 4 feet and planted on my feet. I had immediate pain in my knee. I t was suspected I tore my meniscus and LCL. The pain was severe enough for perscribed narcotics. I was referred to an ortho who then sent me for an MRI.
I went online to look at my results from the MRI and all I can say is WTF?! The radiologist reported no tears or ligaments, cartilage, or meniscus. Instead, they reported patellofemoral maltracking due to swelling of my Hoffa Fat Pad. I don't believe this at all. I have pain over the side of my knee going into the back. Every time I take a step, I have a burning sensation. It's uncomfortable for me to fully bend or straighten the leg. I am going to have my ortho take a very close look at this MRI.
If the radiologist happened to be right, has anyone suffered from patellofemoral maltracking? If so how did you treat it? Did it work? I am twenty years old. I don't want a short term treatment! Any opinions?!
If you'd like to see a photo of my MRI I am happy to show you as well.

"I'm a senior but was younger than age before and age was not an issue but now I feel OLD, very lonely, depressed, nauseated, and no compassion for life.  Pain in knee is getting better but still swollen, warm to touch and sharp pains shoot suddenly.  I drove myself to my Dr appt. and did ok... used walker. At least I got out of house. The pain meds were vital at the begining but became less affective and left side effects like big-time hangover, no appetite. this is my first time on forum and would be very nice to hear back from some of y'all out there.

"My husband aged 58  had a TKR on 21st December, came out on the 23rd and was back in by the 26th with cellulitis. After seeming to do well on morphine when he first came out on Ocycodone, he is struggling with pain after contracting an infection and is now on codeine 60mg. He is sleeping fitfully, doesn't want to leave the house for even a short walk and spends most of the days going from bed to settee and back. Although the knee is doing well and the physios are impressed, I am just worried by how wiped out he is.  He can't face going anywhere else because he may not be able to get comfortable and alleviate the pain.  I'm not trying to take him out for dinner or anything, just a trip to the local Costa.   Am I just being unrealistic in expecting him to be able to manage more at this stage or does he need higher levels of painkillers.  His GP said he didn't want him to go back on the morphine, but I am wondering if this would significantly help him.  I hate to see him looking so grey all the time.

"Hello,
I am 59 years old.
On March 15, I underwent Arthroscopy surgery on my knee. What was performed was a Partial Medial Meniscectomy, due to Radial and Horizontal Tears.
I suffer from severe pain, especially at night, and the various types of pain relievers don't really help. I would like to ask whether there is any special reason for this nocturnal pain and if there is anything I can do to relieve this pain.
I would also like to ask, what is the average recovery time from such surgery? I mean, how long till I can walk properly?
Thanks in advance,
Dany

"Not knowing exactly what they do in knee surgery,but have an idea. I had mine approx 16 weeks ago. Doing quite well,walking without a stick now,driving,going to the gym doing exercises in pool etc. Ive stopped taking my naproxen now except when I get pain. The knee still feels a bit ""raw"" as though it needs to heal more. No outward signs,just uncomfortable. Does anyone who has been at this stage know how long this takes to go? Or is it normal to feel twinges from a replaced knee forever? Probably sounds minor considering other peoples posts but any guidelines/insights would be appreciated.

"Dear all,
As I told you guys in my last update, my mother went thru severe issues after knee surgery. Now she is back home after spending 25 days in hospital. She is recovered from following issues hb level, electrolytes imbalance, diarrhoea.
He has started walking 50-60 steps a day. But now from past four days. She started acting abnormal, she rolls her eyes, put her jaws stiff, when we try to make her exercise she starts screaming. Her bed sours are all gone. But she still complain about it. The way she is talking is not normal.
Is this normal? What should I do, because I'm unable to see her like this. I am very worried.
I've made her visit the psychariest, he gave her anti depressants medication which made her sleep. And we can't give those medication due to her previous health conditions.
Any suggestions?

I am being referred for physiotherapy and have to go back to see the consultant in July to see how I am getting on.I am in discomfort all day and the pain and stiffness gets worse as the day goes on especially getting up and down stairs.Wheni am in bed many nights I have bad pains in my thigh which I have been told can be to do with my knee.They briefly mentioned about having an arthroscopy where they trim the damaged cartilage and it is a quick recovery.I need as much advice as possible please.

"Hi guys.  I was lucky enough to find this site a couple weeks after my TKR.  I am almost 12 weeks & stuck at 90 degrees.  I am going to be having a MUA in the next few weeks.  Yesterday, I had to be on my feet ALL day for work (a good 10 hours).  I was SO sore and SO swollen and am still swollen this morning.  I'm curious if this is normal?  I can usual get an ice break throughout the day but didn;t have the opportunity yesterday.  I'm concerned because I have a few more of these days coming up right in a row.  I figured the swelling would be a bit better by now (but then again, I thought my bend would be way better as well).  On a typical day, swelling & pain aren't bad, but I was shocked how being on my feet all day changed that....Thanks for your help!

"I have fibromyalgia, polymyalgia andosteoarthritis in both knees and hips. I am currently waiting for an mri scan before a tkr on my right kneeI'm really struggling at the moment with horrendous pain from my knees as well as the fibro and PMR. I am walking with one elbow crutch as I struggle with two.
We go to a pub quiz on a monday night with some friends we've known for over twenty years and another couple we met at a previous quiz a couple of years ago. I really have to force myself to go as I'm tired and in pain but once there I really enjoy myself. The couple we've not know for as long don't have a family (well she does but the girls in their 20's don't have anything to do with her) their lives revolve around her job and their hiking at weekends. Tonight she told me that she has it on good authority that the best thing for arthritis is walking. She had arthrits in her toe and had a cortisone injection and was told to walk and she has had no pain since. I said that when your knees are bone on bone walking is painful. She wasn't convinced and now I'm fuming!!
I want to tell her to read up on fibromyagia and polymyalgia but she'd probably scoff and say it's a made up condition like yuppy flu!

"I have arthritis in both knees and had an arthroscopy on the left one 11 weeks ago. I was told afterwards that I will need a knee replacement in the future but they say I am too young yet as I'm 49. It did seem that there had been some improvement once the initial pain and swelling had settled, but over the last 3 weeks or so I have been getting more pain again, The pain is different now than before as they shaved down some bone so some of the grinding pain is gone. now it's more like a sharp pain a lot of the time, like a shooting pain that goes through my knee and sometimes to my hip or ankle. bending is still a big problem, it sometimes feels like the knee sticks and I have to force it to bend which is very painful at first. I wake in pain most nights and haven't had an unbroken night's sleep for over 2 weeks. I am having physio but progress seems slow and it feels like I'm back where I was before the surgery. 
It also effects my job as I'm a nurse and at the moment can't do my usual shifts.
just wondering if this is all normal for this stage or should I be concerned that something has gone wrong. grateful for any advice

The pain has not gone away, in fact it's gotten more frequent and is making it hard to sleep. I scheduled a dr appt for Friday. If it was an infection I would be sick, right? Could this pain and limiting movement, along with a crunchy sound, be scar tissue? I have started to use a TENS unit but I am not seeing any improvement.

Well it all went ahead and came home Friday 5th Feb.
It is hard as you all say and nothing can prepare you for it.
Pain is quite bad (codeine 60mg and paracetamol) which is what I've been prescribed for a while now but because of anticoagulant therapy am not allowed my naproxen which makes it feel worse.  Taking 4 hourly on the dot.
Hard to sleep for long because of the pain and cant get comfy. Some people advise to sleep on side - but which side? The opposite side to the op site? Leg feels like lead and been using a belt with loop to lift onto bed until I get a Loop leg lifter from Amazon (ordered) First physio tomorrow.
Managed 90 degree bend 1st day post op.
Taking each day as it comes and reminding myself that this is ""good"" pain not the old bone on bone pain!
So if anyone has any advice how best to get through the first two weeks I would be really grateful.
Icing 5 times a day, trying to walk for 5 mins hourly, donut exercises, managing stairs OK.
You guys have already been really helpful and I found a lot of the advice given before (how to prepare for the op) was really spot on!

"Hi all. I haven't posted on here for several months now but I just wanted to share an update with you. I had my TKR on 19th May 2015 so 10 months on now. The knee is still stiff (I think the flexion is maybe 85 - seeing my surgeon again next month) but the knee regularly swells up. My physio plan let me down post-op and in the end I do my own daily exercises stretching and bending and I walk every day for at least 40 minutes. There is no pain whatsoever in my new knee when walking which is great. I still find going downstairs very difficult, at least to try and do so normally and getting in a car on the left side is awkward if the footwell is tight. I was driving 5 weeks after the op and have been abroad twice since my op so it isn't stopping me getting about but I don't understand why the knee still swells up so regularly. I use rose oil and black pepper oil to massage into the knee daily. To complicate things my right knee is just about to give up (very sore) and I have spondylosis which means I've to be careful with my back so this doesn't help when trying things like going down stairs. Generally, the new knee is stiff after sitting for a while and is sore when I stand up but then the pain goes within 30 seconds of starting to walk about. Just wondered what any thoughts might be on this subject? Cheers!

"You guys problably remember me asking if I should have a TKR or not at 48 years old.  I found a different Dr. and saw him last Wednesday.  Unfortunatley, he is in agreement with the first Dr. that I am too young to have to go through TKR at this age.  However, he did tell me that I do have a menscuis tear that needed to be repaired.  He said he doesn't know how much of my pain is from the bone on bone or the torn menscuis.  He said while he is in there repairing the menscuis he will drill tiny holes in my bone then do a bone marrow transplant from my own bone marrow into my knee in hopes it will grown more cartlige.    He said it wouldn't be the same kind of cartlige that I have worn out but it anything grows it is better than what I have right now.  This is only to buy me time before I have to have the TKR.  He said I would be on crutches for a week and then will wear a custom brace for 6 months to keep me off of the repaired area of my knee to give it time to grow new cartlige.  I am happy and feel a comfort with this Dr, and his recommendations that I did not feel with the other one.  I knew from the MRI from before that it had said I had a torn menscuis but the other dr. said I did not.  
So my question is has anyone had these procedures done regarding the bone marrow transplantation?  If so did it work?  He said it is a brand new procedure that insurance does not pay for but If it gives me a chance I am willing to pay for it.

"Hi
It's been a few weeks since i last posted anything here so i thought i'd give you an update on how things are going for me.  I had my TKR on 30th Dec 2015 and i feel like i'm doing very well.  I still have that tight elastic band feeling around the knee plus swelling and burning but at least i can walk without that awful athritic pain i suffered for so many years. I take meds now and again but i don't need to take them on a daily basis, but i do not hesitate to take them when i need too.  My bend is 110 and my leg is nearly straight so things are rosy at the moment and i'm hoping and praying this will be the case always.  This is such a traumatic op and as stated by a few people already, i don't think any of us are prepared for the shock, pain and recovery time needed when we have it done, BUT, i keep telling myself that every day is a day further to total recovery. I have to have my other knee done as well but i think i'll try and hold off for a while.  Anyway the sun is shining in my part of Wales today and i'm off into the garden to do some weeding.  Everything feels so much better in the sun. 
Best wishes to all the knee people LOL

"Good morning, next week on the 22nd I have a planned surgery to repair my torn quadricep tendon on my left leg, I've been struggling with this problem since 08/2014 when I had to have a revision on my left TKR. I was just 10 days post op when I tried to climb up into my son's semi truck to go along with him to pick up milk from farms. I felt a sharp pain in my knee as I tried pushing off the step to get into the truck, I made it to the seat of the truck but I knew I was in trouble as my knee started to burn and throb with pain after a couple of hours of sitting in the truck my knee was very swelled and hot to the touch. I called my surgeon but my complaint fell on deaf ears and I was reminded I was only 10 days post op and to use ice and the pain medication I was given. The pain was horrible and I could barely put any weight on my left leg this continued for week's I kept reporting my problems to my surgeon but I'd get the same answer, use ice and plan on a longer recovery period because revision surgery of a knee replacement is much more involved the second time around at this point in life this revision surgery was my 10th joint replacement and I knew from experience the revisions take longer to heal. As time went on I had to have my left hip replacement redone making it my 3rd new hip on the left the surgery went ok and I went back to driving my semi truck even through the pain I was having in my left knee, I would have to use my hand to pull up my leg to put my foot on the clutch to I could shift gears in my truck it was very painful to keep working but money doesn't grow on trees so I kept working. About 3 weeks into the hip revision I started having a fever and swelling in my left hip and down my leg, I went to the emergency room and I was told to not worry about it and use ice and again reminded revisions take longer to heal, well my fever got worse so another trip to the emergency room but I was told the something, now my fever was steady at 102.5 and I could hardly walk I called my surgeon and went to see him he didn't even look at my hip or leg, I went home and went to bed I woke up shaking with fever 103.5 so back to the E.R. and sent home told I probably had a bad virus my wife who is a nurse of 30 years couldn't believe the lack of concern from the hospital or my surgeon, I woke up with a 104.5 fever I never in my life felt as sick as I now did. My wife helped me to the car and she took me to a very small local hospital and when I got there the nurse practitioner running the emergency room ordered fluid's and blood test within the hour I learned I was septic and near death with MRSA infection in my left hip, I was taken back to the first hospital by ambulance when I got there things were different and lot's of Dr's started putting their heads together to figure out what to do the nurse practitioner had started me on IV antibiotics which probably saved my life, the orthopedic surgeon on call ordered a ultrasound of my hip and they found a huge pocket of fluid halfway down my femur, they got me ready for the O.R. it was 1am they took out my hip and did a washout in the operative report the surgeon noted the plastic cup of my hip socket was gone the infection ate it the infection also destroyed a lot of the tissue in my leg this was my 4th hip on the left side. To speed things up I recovered from MRSA in my left hip but still had severe pain in my left knee, time went on and my Dr's figured the pain in my leg and knee was coming from my back which I had surgery twice before to remove disk that was pushing on nerves in my spine, the neurosurgeon decided I needed spinal fusion and spacer's put in place of the damaged disc. I had this surgery this past December it did help the nerve pain in my lower leg and foot but NO help for my left leg. So now with nothing else to blame my knee swelling and pain on my surgeon ordered a MRI on my left knee which shows my left quadricep tendon very tore and in need of repair. Oh I forgot to mention I had to have my 5th hip replacement on the left as it was loose I've now had my 12th joint replacement surgery 3 shoulders 3 total knee replacements and 6 hip replacements I only have my left shoulder that is mine, I've had to have both knee's both hips and my right shoulder which is now a reverse shoulder replacement. All that to tell you what my life has been like up to now, so now on the 22nd of March next week I'm having my quadricep tendon repaired, has anyone here or anyone known of anyone having their quadricep tendon repaired this late of having it damaged? On reading about quadricep tears most surgeries are done within the first month of tearing it, I hope it's not to late and I'm not putting myself through this extensive surgery when it might not help, my main problem with my left leg is pain and I can't straighten out my leg and I fall down and my knee gives out. Than you... Mark in Minnesota oh and I'm 55 years old

"I had MUA 5 days ago. My dr. prescribed aggressive ROM therapy 3 times a week for 3 weeks. I went to therapy the next day, and my ROM had decreased from 102 to 98, and this was only after heat therapy and the electrical stimulation (not sure what it's called). I have more swelling, so I know I will not be able to get more ROM until the swelling goes down. Should I tell my therapist I don't want to be pushed to the point of pain? I have heard that this will only create more scar tissue. For 3 weeks after my MUA, I had a therapist at home who really pushed and put me in so much pain that my knee swelled even more. I would like to know your opinions 
On what I should do.
Thanks,

"Morning all. I have posted before regarding a TKR I had done in November, followed by an MUA in January. I am now just over 3 months post op from the TKR and although I had a hiccup in January when I had the MUA done, I feel totally disappointed with the result so far. I am only acheiving a bend of 105 deg and that's when I really push it to the extent that I think it may make me cry!!! I would imagine a normal pain free bend for me would only be around 90 deg. My knee still hurts, aches at night and I cant walk for more than about an hour. I'm still on Tramadol and am finding it hard to come off them as the withdrawal symptoms are horrendous. I'm still not back in work (I'm a kitchen assistant and am on my feet for 8 hours solid), and I honestly wish I had never had this done. Anyone else been like this? I do see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel but just I think I'm getting close it seems to move further away. Would love to hear from anyone else, positive or negative!! x

Tore my meniscus in my right knee 2 days ago. Still got some swelling in the knee but pretty much have full range of motion, although it is painful when it is straight. Does anyone know roughly how long it takes until you're able to walk with no pain? Going on holiday in 13 days so I'm just a little worried about that.

"Good Evening All
I'm sorry I have not been on the forum for quite a wee while.  I have been very busy and just not had time other than occasionally catching up with where everyone is in their recovery.
I guess I also got a bit down as I am still not really seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.  TKR was on 26 October and then I had to have a MUA on 18 December.  I did feel that helped a lot and I also see a great PT.  My bend is good but though my leg is fairly straight, getting downstairs is not great.  Sometimes I can, other times I have to do one stair at a time.
i am still experiencing pain and in fact this has got worse recently, especially in bed.  Pain is at the back of my knee and nothing seems to help.  Standing for too long is excruciating and walks are still out of the question.  I either sleep for an hour at a time or not at all.  Getting really fed up with the whole thing and certainly don't feel that I'm glad I got it done.  Lying in bed at the moment and I know sleep will be out of the question, pain is just too much.
has anybody got any suggestions.  Just don't know what to do.  I have been keeping up with how my old buddies are doing and glad Ann, that your son is doing better.  Hope they get the taxi driver.
good night all

"I have a hyper extended knee that has now become extremely painful and prevents me from doing virtually anything !
My hospital consultant, who I saw 3 months ago - told me that a PKR was on the cards and I waited and waited - until finally, I received a date for the op of Wednesday 16th March (Pre op date Saturday 12th) - I got my head around that.
Then,2 days ago - I received the pre-op forms to fill in - which stated ""Knee arthoscopy"" which has upset the apple cart somewhat
What, exactly are the hospital playing at ?

"Hi all, it's a while since I last posted but, finally, on Monday, I had a TKR of my left leg. All went well and I'm now back home in my own bed. Apart from the usual, and understandable, pain and the feeling of having a slab of concrete attached to my left hip, I have horrendous heartburn. I was first aware of this after immediately coming out of surgery and it remained during my hospital stay and only gallons of Gaviscon helped keep it at bay. Now I'm home I had hoped that it had gone. Unfortunately, it's back tonight With a vengeance. I've taken bicarbonate of soda and that has helped. My question is has anyone out there suffered the same thing. I had a THR in 2012 and had an epidural then and I was fine!

Heeding the advice of Ann 83411 and others{apologies for not naming you as i forgot} on this forum I took a list with me. Pen and noteboojk inm hand. I also wore a suit and tie. I never dress scruffily at the hospital but this time i made an effort. He answered my questions readily,asked some of his own. My knee is titanium and another material,I think he said chrome,and plastic. The clicking he dsaid was quite normal,may last permanently. Said he couldnt get the xrays up in that office but that he had seen them and if anything wrong he would have told me. To be fair he couldnt have been more helpful. The thing is,from his first appearance i could tell he was going to be reasonable. And on the other occasions quite the opposite. I guess we are all human. I was ready for battle today but it was not necessary. But thanks to all on this forum for your help and advice. You are all great and also I wish good outcomes for everybody eventually.

"I'm continuing to have pain on the inside area below my knee, so probably a tendon or something, as not really where the new knee is located.  I am about 12 weeks post op PKR on this knee.  It comes and goes.  I just returned from a trip to Las Vegas where we did a lot of walking and it's very sore.  I do 4 - 5 miles a day on my stationary bike and some leg lifts for my exercises.  I've already had my post op appt. and the doc says all looks great.  Just can't seem to get rid of this one area that just hurts when I put weight on my knee.  Weird though, because somedays it's gone and others it very painful.

"I Saw an orthopaedic consultant privately four weeks ago, he had looked at my X rays and was surprised when I told him that my right knee was the one causing me the most pain. He said my left knee was shot but my right knee had only moderate OA. He said it could be something to do with my kneecap which can cause severe pain. He agreed to put me on his NHS list and I'm attending his clinic tomorrow. He said that I will have X ray's of my knees and hips, apparently they do a specific xray of the knee which shows the kneecap. I'm panicking now as I'm scared that they won't be able to do anything to alleviate this horrible, life affecting pain. I'm getting quite depressed by how little I can do before I'm in agony. It doedoesn't help that I also have sever pain from polymyalgia and fibromyagia. My son rang me today to tell me about cheap rail fares to London, I'd like to go to see the Harry Potter world but there's no way that I could walk round for more than a few minutes at a time and then I'd be exhausted. I'll let you know how it goes at the hospital tomorrow if you can stand to hear my moaning!!!!

"Hi, I'm posting on behalf of my husband, any advice is really appreciated.
My 59 year old husband has suffered with his knee for at least the last 10 years that I've known him. At first midly, but gradually worse due to a road accident and then a DIY mishap!
In short, since 2013 he has been having 6 monthly check ups. In June last year he was told he could have a TKR, all he had to do was make the call. A few days ago he had an appointment and he expressed his wishes to get it done as soon as is possible. He was told  he is too young and he can't get it done until he feels it is unbearable. He has had another steriod injection but it really doesn't help that much.
It already effects everything we do. We can't go for walks, we drive everywhere, he can't sleep, simple things like going shopping means he suffers for days after. He has to take tramdol several times a day. I'm so frustrated for him, our lives have been on hold for the past couple of years now.
What is considered unbearable? I feel he is too young to have to give up being able to do so many different things.
He doesn't want to 'make a fuss' but I don't understand why they won't give him the treatment he was offered, wants and needs,
Thank you

After the first two months I was able to walk about a mile a day without a cane or walker. After that it only improvd. I almost feel guilty as to how well I have done. I can straighten the leg with no problem but have never been able to bend it as well as most people. I still am not able to bend it but I have absolutely no pain or discomfort so I feel it was a success. My Dr. asked if I wanted him to bend it and I said no, I am almost 77 and am free from pain so I am not willing to have anything more done to it. I hope everyone out there does as well.

I can bend my knee a little but I can't lock my knee out.  I'm afraid that PT will push me too much and hurt me again.  I will tell them to look at the xrays.

"Hi all, I'm a 63 year old ex Firefighter from England and up to 2 years ago used to walk 8 mile countryside circuits 3 to 4 times a week with no pain. My arthritis seemed to come on very quickly.
As some of you may know from other discussions, I had my left TKR in November then my right one 8 weeks later in January. I was walking normally after two weeks with the first but not very far and the stairs coming down were somewhat painful still. However from that day I felt improvement and on looking back each weekit was measurable.
The second one seemed to lag behind the first one and I reached the two week stage after four weeks but much the same good improvement. I consider myself to be very lucky when I read some of the comments on the forum.
My reason for this post is to try and reassure those who see no end.
If, as me , you suffered from arthritic pain before the operation then just remember the pain you were in before. Even with the operation 'afterpain' I considered it to be preferable than the pain I was enduring before. It was nice to know that the original pain was totally gone.
A few tips that seemed to work for me.
1. I found the best stretching exercise was the simplest - stand at the stairs with your bad leg on the second step and bend until you feel the stretch and hold for 5 seconds. Repeat this 10 times. Do this everytime you pass the stairs.
2. Walk- But walk correctly. Heel down and roll completely through to ball of foot. It's important. Walk slowly and concentrate on doing it correctly. You'll know when you are. It's not a race.
3. Nip to the chemist and buy some cocoa butter WITH vitamin lotion. This is readily available and recommended for pregnant women to reduce chance of stretch marks. If it makes your skin that supple then it's exactly what you need to heavy massage your knee and calf. It's worked for me! Use your finger ends and really push into all the swollen area including the scar when you feel it is healed sufficiently. This breaks up the fat and fluid as well as opens your muscles.
4. Keep taking your meds, don't let it out of your system enough to feel pain. Remember you've been butchered and you'll need them for a long time to come. I found that setting my phone alarm for midnight, 7 am, 12 pm lunch then 6 pm evening works for my routine. Whilst in hospital I was on 2 x 30mg of codeine and 2 x 500mg of paracetamol four times a day. Plus the morphine. On leaving hospital the morphine stopped. After a few weeks I dropped to half that amount but periodically feel that I need to double up again if I've done too much but as soon as possible drop down again. You NEED your meds, so use them.
5. If you have done any excess exercise then put a frozen bag of peas on your knee for 15 minutes then under your knee for 15 minutes. Move it about so that it cools all the effected area.
Someone says that this forum is really only for those who are having problems with their knee. I don't disagree, but will clarify that EVERYONE who has had a TKR has a problem, even me. IT HURTS but it will get better and think on all those who are at 12 weeks and more - remember what it was like last week and the week before. You are improving and not everyone is the same so don't worry.
Finally, I'm sorry for the length of this but all I've done before is answered others posts and unless you are following a particular one you may have missed it. My email box seems to be overful of comments and it's time for me to unfollow now. I wish everyone success on their recovery.

"I noticed a rash about a month ago from my operated knee down almost to the shin,around 9 inches. Looks like dermatitis. All on right hand side of knee. Saw the Nurse at doctors,she wrote me a prescription for canesten cream. Doesnt seem to be working. Could it be related to the replacement and why if anybody has any ideas or experienced this? Thank you folks.

Sleeping well, walking well, forgetting about my knees which I thought would never happen.
Icing not needed. Swelling very minimal.
Taking Ibuprofen as needed. Noticed I had forgotten to take any for 13 hours the other day!
Weather effects arthritis in OTHER parts of my body. I find that my knees are two joints that DON'T HURT while other joints are causing pain. Are they just seeking attention????!!!!
Can shop, shovel the driveway, be on my feet baking and cooking, and feel normal again without terrible pain and aches.
Require more sleep than in the past. The body still healing? Trying to play catch-up after YEARS of interrupted sleep?
Legs still get stiff if in one position too long. I still need to keep moving to stay flexible.
Very very glad I had my two TKRs. Looking forward to spring when I am going to try to resume walking in my neighborhood again, gradually building up my distance as I did MANY YEARS AGO before all my knee pain sidetracked me!
Very grateful for this site! I have gotten so many wonderful tips and learned what to expect from so many here!
To those in the early stages following surgery...keep at it. Be confident. Listen to your body. It gets easier.

"Hi all
12 week post TKR
Many of you will know me from this forumI'm Irish Ann.
Everyone on this forum has been so helpful and informative and I would not be as well as I am today without you all. Thank you.  Thank you.
My world at the moment is in chaos.
My one and only sister, which I have spoken about on this forum, is in hospital 50 miles away with a virulent form of pneumonia.  She is quite frail, and is very ill.
My mother (she's 91) is in hospital near me for over a week, with the same pneumonia.  She had given it to my sister.  My mother is doing well and is responding to treatment.
My husband is in the same hospital awaiting an operation in the 'man problem' area.
He has major heart problems so anaesthesia is a problem and they are still not sure how to proceed at the moment.
He has a large inoperable clot in the back of his heart.
He also has haemachromatosis.
All three are serious and coud kill him and I dont know which bit of him to worry about the most!
But by far the worst and saddest of all is I am losing him, my husband of 47 years, my best friend to dementia. 
He is slowly fading away from me.  Did not remember that they had told him he had a clot in the heart.  Did not tell me about the haemachromatosis nor did he turn up for the appointment that was made for him.  I only found all this out a couple of weeks ago, and the haemachromatosis when he was admitted yesterday.
He will never go into a doctors surgery without me EVER again.
It was a wake up call for me, I had not realised how bad he really was, as on day to day things he is fine.  But anything new he will keep asking you the same thing over and over again.
Terrible too for me was going to the doctors yesterday and explaining that he would not remember a word of what they tell him and they would need to refer to me.
I know this has absolutely nothing to do with TKR but just needed to have a rant and you are the best guys I know for that.
Thank you for listening
Ann

"Hi, it's nearly nine weeks since my TKR op and  i'm doing pretty good.  Still have the tight band feeling around the knee and the burning feeling but on reading the posts here thats pretty normal stuff so i'm not complaining.  Could someone let me know how many miles i should be walking.  Did just 2 miles yesterday and was exhausted and had a bit of pain in my knee later in the evening. I've seen a few different PT and they give me conflicting advice, i've learned to listen to the comments on this site as they make much more sense.

"Well, new to me anyway. I ha never heard of it before yesterday.
Background: I had right knee TKR 15 months ago with manipulation 12 months ago. I was supposed to get the left TKR but had SUCH a horrible time with the first I never went back. Yesterday I went in though because I have always had pain with the TKR on stairs and now it was getting more painful and seemed a little puffy. It bends very well - probably a good 130 degrees which is great after thee 3 months I was stuck at 90.
Anyway surgeon had changed his tune a little. Said it was just as well I hadn't come back for the left TKR because he refused to do it until I crawled in and begged him for it. Said I would likely have all the same problems because both knees had had previous major surgeries. So I guess that ideal of a 5 mile hike is off the cards for a while.
He said that the right knee nowstill had scar tissue and that he had straightened it out so there were alignment issues and maybe the tendons got moved around and perhaps stretched suring the surgery (I'd say no doubt about that!). The muscles I use on stairs are different and so the problem with the stairs is that those muscles are rubbing or pulling on the tendons. He said the area was still inflamed.

"I have been reading up about this, as a neighbour is having it done on the 18th January. He is 70, & wants to still ski, the surgeon is a Mr.David Barrett. It reads VERY good, less invasive, can last over 10 years, only a 4"" scare, side incision so the tendons/ligaments are left alone & they can go in again to re-do it. I would consider this for my other knee once I have got over the revision but would love to know if anyone has actually had it done?

After 3 months of unimaginable pain and telling my surgeon it was infected, he finally tapped it, it was infected ( from pseudomonas in the OR) and was removed. 3 months with no joint and IV antibiotics at home, I got a new knee. End of story, right. No, I have neuropathy that is ongoing and lateral joint pain even at rest. I'm not sure why this is mine to bear, but sometimes I even get sick of the story.As I lay in bed tonight, I wonder if I will ever be the same.

"Hi all, I am new to this forum and I wonder if anyone has an idea what is causing my pain.
It happens only when I am laying in bed, and usually more towards morning.  I awaken myself due to my moaning.  Both knees just hurt like crazy!  Once I get up, they do not hurt the rest of the day.  This has been happening for many years.
I had one knee surgery 10 years ago and was told that my knee would need replaced and that that surgery should last 7 to ten years.  The surgery was drilling into my knee in five different places to cause micro fractires in order to encourage the natural growth of cartilage. Well, this is the tenth year, but why would my other knee be hurting right along with the surgery one?
Thanks for any ideas

"Good morning all. I haven't posted on here for a few weeks now so thought I'd share where I am six months after my TKR. I've encountered problems with stiffness and ability to bend my new knee fully since the operation. I had to go into hospital a few weeks ago for a manual manipulation under local anaesthetic. This temporarily improved the movement to 95% but of course when I went home from hospital the situation couldn't be sustained. I do exercises every day, focusing mainly on bending the knee as much as I can. I can walk fair distances but still have difficulty with stairs and getting in and out of cars as a passenger (driving isn't a problem). The knee does swell occasionally and still feels very tight at times. I'm still taking co-codamol and naproxen now and again, the latter for my back problems and arthritis in the other knee! I just wondered what others might think about where I should be six months after my TKR? I don't see my surgeon again until mid-January and have just started a course of hydrotherapy. Cheers!

"I had knee revision surgery 3 weeks ago.   My knee replacement surgery #1 was Aug. of 2014.  I develolped a contracture, had -30 for extension and do not know what it was on bending.   I had a MUA as well as a Arthoscopy surgery, none helped at all.   So, fast forward to Jan. of this year, I opted for my only choice left, a knee revision.   While I was really worried about all the ""what ifs""  I knew this was my only chance at trying to walk normal again, as I was now in a wheelchair following the first knee replacment.  
I did well in the hospital, as I did before, up quickly, participating in pt at the hospital, home within two days, etc.   My knee does not feel as stiff as it did, before it literally felt like concrete.   However, it measures -20 for extension and 60 for bending.   Not very good numbers.   I have been in physical therapy, just had my fifth session.  I fear the numbers wont get any better, they did not budge before, I came out of surgery number one at a minus 30 and after three months of pt was still at a minus 30.   
I am better able to walk with a walker, which I attempted  before,  and wound up on the floor.   Now, I can take short walks about the house on the walker, into the pt office, etc.  Anything longer than that and I need my power chair.  What frustrates me one of several is my surgeron saw me at my two week followup, saw me on the walker and declared no more wheelchair!   How does he expect someone with the ROM I have to be able to walk much further than a short ways?   I dont know if he is not being realistic or what.    I would LOVE to be able to say no more wheelchair, ever, but thats just not possible  at least not yet.   
I am feeling a bit discouraged, as like I said I have been down this road before, I feel as if I am gaining absolutely nothing, and very worried I wont be able to leave the wheelchair behind someday.   The pt tries to force my leg to straighten, oh my gosh does this hurt, but to no avail, it goes right back.   Anyhow, thanks for letting me vent......

"Hi everyone,
Over the last few years I have had various injuries to my right knee, I have ruptured my ACL twice and have torn my MCL also. Something that has also been very problematic is my medial meniscus, it just keeps tearing.
When I first ruptured my ACL about 4 years ago I also had the meniscus trimmed down during surgery because there was a large tear in it. Since that day, I have had it trimmed down twice again- amongst other surgeries.
After so many injuries to it, you get to know the feeling of when its torn and I am 100% sure that I have another tear in it again, right on the inside of my right knee. It has been there for a couple of months now but has become increasingly problematic in the last week.
I was wondering if anyone has suffered similarly to me and has any suggestions on how to prevent it from happening, or how to minimise its effect. Bearing in mind that I am only 19 so I need to sort it out.
Thanks very much

"I am nearly nine weeks post TKR.   I have been going to knee gym with physios at local hospital.   Last Tuesday they gave me an assessment before going for check up with surgeon on Friday and bend was 117 but extension -3.   The OT discharged me saying if surgeon was not happy she would reinstate me to group.
At hospital on Friday surgeon delighted with bend but not happy with extension which he says will give me a lot of trouble later if I do not get down to 100.  I think this is because I have spinal stenosis and he is trying to give me the best possible result.   Phoned local hospital who have changed their minds and will not reinstate me because she thinks he is being unreasonable.  She says their surgeons would have accepted.    She says go it alone and then she will review in a fortnight.
I am not very happy about this because I have to  be careful because of my spine.   Have been doing the lying on the bed exercise pressing backs of legs into mattress which I have in fact been doing since well before op.  Surgeon told me to press down on area above knee with both hands till it hurts.  He demonstrated and it did hurt!   But I discover I cannot get that sort of pressure because of arthritis in hands, or perhaps more scarily I am pressing wrong bit.  Last night my leg was very, very painful and I got no sleep at all so am unsure of my exercise.  I have also tried lying on tummy on bed with knee and lower leg hanging over edge.
Has anyone any good suggestions.

"Hi,
My wife has had knee dislocation since her childhood. She had knee arthoscopy with lateral release in Aug-2015. The doctor told us that the proceedure was very likely to resolve the issue. However, it has been about 6 months and she cannot bend her knee more than 40 degrees. Now the doctor says he does not know why her knee isn't bending and he is suspecting that her patella tendon has problem that cause knee pain and that is why she cannot bend her knee. Although he confirms that right after the arthoscopy he was able to bend her knee all the way while she was under anesthesia. So he is suggesting that we go with TTT (Tibial Tubercle Transfer surgery) where he could cut the bone and move her patella inwards to help with dislocation & pain. This surgery is invasive and we are scared and looking for second opinon.
So does anyone on this forum knows a very good doctor in bay area who could provide us second opinion and confirm the diagnosis?
Do you feel that her current doctor will mind if he comes to know that we are seeking second opinion?
We will appreciate your responses.

"I have been havign this problem for about 3.5 years. Some 3 years back, even my MRI was okay. I have knee pain which is on and off. It appears to be at front of knee. Other weird symptom (less often but definite) are ""feeling of shrinkage"" at deep calf, and some numbess at bottom of foot (sole). There is very little swelling of this knee (left). It is best when I wake up in morning and worst with driving (of manual car). Nothing special in history, except that I used the same left leg ""more"" as compared to right for several years (due to sperate injury on right ankle which is okay now).
Around one year back, one rheumatologist said that I am flat-footed and told me to wear insoles specifically made for flat footed people. Also advised me to take multi vitamins and salmon fish oil. Told me execises as well: Raise myself on tip of toes and then back to normal on full feet, and repeat. Other was sit and raise leg up without bending, and repeat.
Insoles and exercies appear to help - I think it reduced by 80%, but it never got fixed completely. In past 1 week, the problem has resurfased with extremity as it was before I met this rheutamologist. It is constant now.
I have no idea what exactly is wrong with me. Can any one please comment?
One question, I do have is, can it become worse than this? I mean, I do not want it to impact my career.
BTW, I am 28. Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

"I am now 7 weeks post op and feel like I am stuck in a rut...I am still at almost 90 degrees flection and -5 straight.  I have been in PT 3X per week for 2-3 weeks now.  I feel like I'm at a standstill and am wondering if anyone else has experienced the same thing.  I see some improvements but they seem so small.  I still have a little bit of a limp but the lack of flection is what has me concerned.  My Dr was happy at my 6 week appointment & mentioned manipulation, which I want to avoid at all cost.  I appreciate any help or comments you can offer!

"Hi, I know this has been mentioned in the past, I think I commented on it, but I am now beginning to stress about this. My recovery seemed OK until about 7 weeks post op when I realised that I couldn't straighten my knee. I don't know if the swelling had stopped me noticing this before, but at my 6 week check, all was well and my surgeon was happy. Now I can't walk properly, uphill is ok, but downhill is a struggle and painful, also back of knee really stiff and painful after even a short sit down.
I attend physio weekly and have been advised to hold off from all usual exercises, can use the static bike, bend and extend my knee and use the bottom stair as a ""step"" for exercises. I can also use the pool when I can get there, but there seems little or no improvement.
Has anyone else experienced this at 11 weeks or beyond, or have any advice that has worked for them.
I am in the UK.
Thanks.

"So the story is about 3 weeks old. About then i had the knee injury when i was playing basketball, could describe it as that i put too much weight on that knee, kind of lost rythm when i was going for a layup and i felt something went wrong with me knee. I fell down and it hurt but i could stand and limp about 5 minutes later. It got swollen but i just sit there and watch the rest of the game. The next day pain got worse. It felt really stiff and couldn't really walk, doc said that i need to R.I.C.E and come a two day later. He punctured the knee but still wasn't sure what it is then and i was told to come a week later. And when i come a week later they were amazed att how better it got, i could walk, do the squat almost all the way, could jump, so he told me i need to strengten the muscles around the knee and i can go back to basketball after 2-3 weeks. They told me it was just some vein in my knee that broke but that's nothing. After 1 week, i thought i could go out for a light running and just dribbling the ball a bit, really light, but on one movement it happened again, although not as intense as it did the first time. It hard really bad for a hour or two but i could limp it happened 6 days ago and i can walk almost normally today, yesterday i went swimming, i can't really run, as it is swollen and stiff a bit because of that, but it's clearly getting better. So i am not sure if i could just continue to rest, apply ice or the fact this is still swollen after 6 days is a reason i should seek medical opinion. So, what's your opinion? There are pictures of my knee and the movement radius i can do. Could it just be some sprain or what?

Within days the stiffness returned. I have done all the exercises and I'm now at my wits end wondering if it will ever improve.

"I just went to the doctor who was very happy with my flexion and bending. He told me I don't even need PT any longer and to keep walking, swimming and doing whatever it is I've been doing. The last time I was measured I was about 120-122 in both knees. I had double knee replacement. My gait is good. I do not limp. This last week I have walked, stood and climbed steps more and at night have really paid the price. I had two nights where I really was unable to sleep because of the aching and pains going down the shins from the knees. I've iced and used heat but unhappy about this. The next day was difficult to walk. I'm feeling like one step forward two steps back. My husband says this is just ""part of the healing process"" and to just keep going. It's depressing, though. I'm tired of being in pain and want to move on with my life and be aboe to walk 1-2 miles without being incapacitated the next day. I was also told that I would just need Tylenol or Aleve at this point for pain but.....doesn't put a dent in the night pain. Anyone else experienced this?

"Hello all - I was doing brilliantly after my revision on Oct 27th - until about 2 weeks ago, when I seem to have slipped backwards in a big way. I had a great bend & straighten, struggled with stairs, but had little pain, just stiffness. Now I have pain. Real pain. Also, I have developed pockets of what looks like fluid once again (had these the 1st time they did the primary TKR- however an aspiration back then proved no infection) - the bend is certainly diminuating as I now struggle to excercise. My husband thinks I may have overdone it, as I spend time on a static bike (turning it to make the pedals stiffer) as well as excercising & trying to be a normal human being. BUT - last night I resorted back to medication as I spent all night awake wondering where this pain has come from! I'm at 14+ weeks, & see the surgeon again at the end of March, & if this going backwards thing carries on - they'll be wheeling me in to see him in a wheelchair! I am concerned, as I was doing so very well. Revision TKR'ers - is this normal? (I ask myself if I will ever feel normal again).
Today I've decided to have a day off from excercising - it's too wet to walk outside, but I have walked around a supermarket & was desperate to come home & ice this swollen lump of a knee. Should I take a few days off - will it harm any progress? Any comminication gratefully recieved! - Veronica

"I had a total knee replacement of the left knee and I am now 16 days post-op.  The moment I woke up from anaesthetic I had terrible pain in my hip joint and cannot get rid of it. I alternate heat and ice, stretching, massaging and changing positions regularly but it is almost unbearable to sit. It is especially bad at night and I battle to get enough sleep. Sometimes the spasm moves into the thigh - mostly side and back of thigh.  My knee is not a problem at all and I take short walks indoors troughout the day.  Has anybody else experienced the same or has any advice?

"Hi all, out there in the connected world. I'm just after some feedback from other peops who've had a complete resection of a knee joint. Replaced with Distal Femur prosthesis. Mine was done in May 2104 at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (Australia) and I have to say, although it has been a long road and a lot of work, the results 20 months down the track are fantastic. I have amazing range of movement, can easily walk 10km a day (with no pain) can climb stairs and do nearly everything I used to.
I no longer play sport (contact sports, or water sports or running) as, I'm primarily finished with them anyway. But running is now difficult because the mechanics of the prosthetic knee joint are different to my other joint and I can't synchronise them for a good run speed. It doesn't hurt to run, but it sure looks hilarious!
The reason I had to have the prosthetic was due to 27 years of fighting PVNS. The 30 plus synovectomies and a Yttrium injection had destroyed too much bone to be viable for a TKR. Surgeons who know about diffuse PVNS won't do a normal TKR anyway, because the disease will make the replacement fail.

"I am 48 years old and a 1 1/2 years ago was diagnosed as bone on bone on my right knee.  My othro started me doing steriod shots every 3 months.  They worked for a while, then only lasted a month then I had two months of pain again.  A month ago they tried Synvisc shot.  I can barely feel a difference.  I am so scared to go through with the surgery because I do not want to be in worse shape than I am now.  Right now I can still walk a short distance with pain.  If I turn just right it feels as if my whole knee has came unhindged.  I was a very active person but now I work and go home to become a couch potato.  If I go shopping I can't even walk through wal-mart without extreme pain.  It is to the point I have my husband do all my shopping because shopping makes my knee so much worse.  I want to be able to shop again, to work in my yard again.  I work a desk job but in a big facility so walking is a chore at work.  I know surgery will be horrible but in the end will I be in better shape than I am now?  My ortho said the bone on bone is due to osteoarthritis.  My other knee is on it way to being bad too but I can still bend it.  My right knee I cannot completely straighten it out anymore.  Crossing my right leg over my left is impossible.  I even hurt it in my sleep at times if I move the wrong way.  Anyone that has had tkr at my age please let me know if I should just continue as I am or get the tkr?

"After my knee replacement from day one I have had pain over the lateral joint line. I've been told it's iliotibial band but whatever it is it is the area that has been the most consistent and the most painful. At physical therapy they try heat ultrasound and massage which decreases the pain temporarily but never completely. It prevents me from standing on the operated leg and Lowering myself to the next step when trying to go down steps. It also is the limiting factor for me obtaining flexion although I can get to 125° with discomfort. The pain has diminished somewhat better still my most limiting factor

"hi I had my left knee replaced in febuary 2015, then my right knee Noember 2015. All great, my right one is perfect. I have had no physio and have complete bend and straight. Signed off from the hospital on Tuesday. Nearly a year of discomfort.
Wednesday I had an appointment with my G.P. Because I have a black spot appeared on my right sole. My G.P. Said it was properly nothing but she would send me to the dermintoligy department to get it checked out. That afternoon I had a phone call asking me to go on Thursday morning. I arrived the consultant checked it over, asked if I would mind her colleagues looking at it. It appears that I have a malignant melanoma. I am having it removed tomorrow morning  less than 72 hours from seeing the G.P. I never knew you could get a melanoma on the sole of your foot. I am writing this in the forum to spread this. 
I am very up beat as we know it was not there in November so it has been caught early. But I now face at least two more operations and possible chemo, I thought that having my knees replaced was very hard but this is so much worse as I'm not sure of the end result. Sorry to share this but I am very scared.

Thought I would check in and let y'all know how it's going with my left tkr and work. I drive a semi and went back to work after 12 wks. Seems to be ok as long as I keep doing exercises and keep my leg up for some of the day. I wear a brace now when I drive and occasionally have to use my cane if I've had a long day. I get tired pretty easy but all in all doing ok. Not looking forward to having the right knee done but will plan that for this year and try to take the winter off from work again.

This last four days I only got the streaching in once a day and the leg has felt so much better so I just keep thinking once a day would be good at this point. I just get so tired of the pain that comes with streaching. I also have not gone back to Therpy to see what my numbers for straight and bend are, but how important is that? So ready to start playing pickleball again which they said if I'm careful I could start in January so want to start slow but scared something will happen.

"Hi All!
I am now 28 weeks and 13 weeks post op from my two TKRs. Looking back at the last five years or so I have to reflect on all that's taken place and must say that if I knew THEN what I know NOW I definitely would have gone in sooner to see about having my surgeries.
Of course recovery from ANY surgery is grueling, and TKRs bring their own special issues (swelling, having to walk on knees that have just had tremendous trauma, pain, dealing with medication FOR pain that may bring its own trouble and side effects, taking blood thinners and giving yourself SHOTS in your abdomen, having to be helped to the bathroom...The list goes on and on!)
Even with all of the recovery issues and dealing with physical therapy and STAIRS (my personal nemesis!), I STILL have to say that I am MUCH BETTER off than I was before my surgeries. Before having surgery I would begin experiencing pain even walking into the grocery store! By aisle two I was standing on one foot, standing on the other foot, leaning on the cart and wondering how I was going to get all my shopping done. If I grabbed a few items and left, I was angry at myself that I didn't get all I needed. If I stuck it out and DID all the shopping I needed to do, I really paid for it when I finally got home, needed to put away everything and put my legs up KNOWING I would be experiencing great amounts of PAIN for days to come because I went GROCERY SHOPPING!
That was absolutely ridiculous on my part, but I put up with it, and I bet many of you put up with it, too!
I now can shop for HOURS, garden, shovel snow, play with our granddaughter, climb into our son's new truck, stand in the yard talking to my neighbor, bake cookies, and NOT have to stand on one foot, stand on the other foot and look for chairs to sit down on everywhere I go. I wish I had soldiered on and gotten my surgeries sooner.
I was fortunate to have no complications with my surgeries. I thank God every day for that. I am retired, so I have no schedule I must keep and can rest as needed. My husband has health issues of his own but TRIES to help. I am grateful for that. I am a positive person and pray a lot, and I KNOW FOR SURE that has been a HUGE part of my recovery.
I often look down at my HUGE scars on my knees and reflect on the last 28 weeks of my life. I have to say that even WITH all the pain, the recovery issues, the relearning how to walk again, using the walker and cane and working on developing proper bend and successful straightening, I STILL would do ALL of it again because I now have my life back. At 64 I can walk again. I can do the things I USED to love to do, and I have a chance to enjoy my family again by looking forward to our youngest son's wedding in September and playing with our oldest son's baby girl without CONSTANTLY being in pain and thinking about my knees.
I am SO GRATEFUL that I took the leap of faith and had my surgeries!
It is my hope that we all reach a point of less pain, be able to do things we haven't been able to do, get our life back and enjoy ourselves and our favorite things to do.
I am so thankful to everyone here on this site. I have learned so much here and have especially appreciated that I have people available who really understand my issues. Thanks to all who have helped me throughout these many weeks of recovery and will continue to be there as I keep recovering!

"I posted previously at my post op day 6.  Not a pleaseant time.  I just wanted to follow up.  
I was given hydrocone for pain, which resulted in my experiencing EVERY negative side effect listed for this drug.  I am convinced that my recovery would have been smoother and less painful, had I not been under the influence of this drug.  Mentally I became someone totally different from myself.
I finaly realized tha t it was the drug, and not the after effects of the surgery, and quit cold turkey.  Took a day or two to get it out of my system, but what a huge improvement all the way around.
I am taking only regular Tyenol now, and although, I still have some pain, it is tolerable, and I am back to being myself.
Nothing going forward could have been worse than those first days post op.

"8 months ago I had a TKR  on my left leg it was so much harder then I ever imagined I was in Pt for six months 3x a week and had a problem with my bend after six months and much pain my bend went to 105 degrees. Came to Florida for a short stay and one month ago got into a bad car accident and crushed my right leg I broke my femur knee and tibia they did a external fixation then two    
days later they  went back in and cleaned up all the small broken bones that where to small to fix did a TKR and put rods and screws in the femur and tibia. I'm still using a walker the problem is much pain that is depressing and exhausting. because I live in New York my health insurance only covers emergencies when I'm out of state so that means the minute I walked  out of the hospital the cost for anything is mine. Even though I was told the surgeon did the impossible I'm over 1 inche taller on the right leg which is causing me along with knee pain in both knees but also hip and back pain and everyone thinks I should be off the pain meds I'm taking which are running out and no one wants to refill.

"Yesterday was my 6 week check-up with my new surgeon after my left TKR revision, & a whole year of pain & stiffness. What a brilliant man he is! He doesn't measure bends etc, he saw me sitting, watched me walk, got me to put my legs up & down, took me to a different room to see my x-rays, all the time watching how I walked & stood, & then told me too much pressure is put on getting to ""goals"", so never insists patients are at a certain stage - just lets them get on with it. He was VERY pleased with me, told me to ditch crutches outside as soon as I felt confident, (again, my choice) gave permission for me to drive again - in fact, because I really do feel & look so much better, I could see on his face how pleased he was with his handiwork. I saw on the x-rays how deep the revision prosthesis is in the tibia & femur, the false ""ligaments"" are actually one post, joining the two together. He pointed out my re-coated (again!) kneecap. I don't have the same horrendous pain re cut & re-stitched tendons & muscles, but he assured me it all had to be cut again, so I am putting it down to his skill. All in all, at just 6 weeks, time to celebrate. Did I say he is also extremely good looking - if only I wasn't old enough to be his mother..............................!!!!!
Those of you who are thinking of revisions, all I can say is - go for it. We are just statistics in that little box on the consent papers we all signed, so many TKR's are not perfect, but you do not have to live with it.
Merry Christmas one & all.

For the first few months, I had intensive PT - but it had little effect.  Then, more recently, it was suspected I had scar tissue - and would maybe need an operation to remove that.  Yesterday, the surgeon suggested I may have an infection.  I had X-Rays and blood tests yestereday, and am awaiting a bone scan.  I understand that if an infection is confirmed, I will need the knee removed, followed by a period of treatment for 3-6 months, then another TKR.  Not looking forward to this, just wondered if anyone else had undergone a similar procedure and, if so, what their experience was.

I know it varies from hospital to hospital and Consutant to Consultant buy wondered just what does happen?
I think bloods and medical exam to determine you are fit pre operatively but is there anything specific to TKR's I should be aware of?

"Hi
I hope someone can help because the UK NHS has been of little assistance so far. Last night I woke up in severe pain where it felt like something had dislocated on my knee (it felt like the little bump on the outside of my knee). I was left holding it at 90 degrees and pushing into the underside of my thigh to relieve some of the pain which went right through my leg. I had no other pain or swelling at all.
Eventually after being told I needed to make my own way to A&E something physically ""popped"" as I struggled to get up and the pain was reduced. I couldn't stand for another 6 hours as my whole calf had cramped up and it remains sensitive/stiff. A bruise has appeared just beneath the bump on the outside of the knee joint, and the whole area on the outside of the joint is swollen.
I've searched and searched but I can't find out what may have actually happened.
I'm really worried it will happen again tonight. I rang NHS Direct again who advised me to follow RICE for knee injuries but maintain there's little they can do and that I should see my GP in due course. Does anyone have any advice or insight into what may have happened as the NHS wouldn't be drawn over the phone.
Any help appreciated

I had scar tissue pop before and it was similar to that.  The sharp pain subsided  but I still continued to have pain and as of late it seems to be getting worse.  Doing stairs, up or down, is far more difficulty than it was before this happened.  Also, the outside of my knee is really hard which I do not remember this before.  I had my knee replace July 17 and did wonderfully until this happened.  I do have a doctor's appointment on Feb 1.

"If I don't wear my compression stockings to bed, I am lucky if I get a couple of hours sleep because I wake up with excrutiating pain in my knee and above it (I think it is nerve/neuropathic pain), as when I get up and move around or sit down my feet up, the pain goes away.  Last night I put the stockings back on for bed at around 11pm, and slept till 8!  I know the simple solution is wear them.  But I didn't have this problem when I had the left knee done and ditched the stockings well before the 6 weeks.
I am taking a multitude of drugs to try and get on top of this; 
co-codamol 30/500, gabapentin 300mg, amitrptiline, voltarol suppositories, Butrans patches, arcoxia.  
By now I should be using a lot less drugs than this, and unless I can get full sleep on a regular basis, it will delay my return to work.
I suppose my questions are;
1) Is there anything else I can do except wear the vile stockings
2) Has anyone else had this nerve pain following this procedure
3) Should I be doing anything else about this pain in my legs, or ignore it and be more patient (I have had 2 prior spinal surgeries, and this latest procedure was done under epidural and sedation)
I am new to the group and I am sorry for the ramble, but this ""side effect"" could be such a set back as I have got 110 degrees bend, no pain on walking, wound is healed and is regularly moisturised with E45 to help with movement
thank you

"Hi All, some of you may have seen earlier posts over the last few weeks. I had a TKR on the 29th November and then last Tuesday I had an MUA. The bend on my knee before the MUA was around 70 deg. According to my notes, the surgeon acheived a bend of 120 deg during the procedure. I managed to maintain a bend of 90 deg and spent 15 hours straight on a CPM machine. Now that I am home I'm finding it difficult to keep the bend again. it is so painful, possibly worse than the TKR, I am taking loads of painkillers including Tramadol and Morphine but I am still struggling. Anyone else had this done? I am concerned that I am going to end up exactly where I started and its really beginning to get me down.
Thanks, Alison.

"i had an injury while playing football, my knee from back got swelled and next time when i play i feel pain but it was on and off. Now when i met orthopedic consultant, and done MRI he confirmed me that i have Meniscus tear medial type and if you are not feeling pain, we will let you go on for 3 months and do swimming in order to do some muscle build up as if he remove the meniscus tear it will be ok, but after 5 years approximately i will build up ostearthritis... because its god gifted...my question is can somebody see my MRI reports , and advice me shoud i do operation or not, or any way that my meniscus tear should be stitiched up or any home remedy or having some supplements etc?? im non medical person , age 30 living in middle east.
your best advice will make my mind good for some decisions....

"Has ANYONE suffered this Scenario???
Had a TKR replacement 2.5 years ago. All good!
Had a T/Hip/R 12 weeks ago on other leg( all good)
BUT...... The strain on my Knee leg from hip op( other leg) I've damaged my hamstring have inflammation in tendons, Fluid in the knee joint,IT Band and Bursa.Prosthesis all ok. This has caused me to be housebound for 10 weeks!!!!! Hardly able to walk, huge swelling etc. Last 5 weeks I finally gave in and stopped trying to do anything just rested , ice etc ..... All of which is the opposite needs of my new hip, but can't be helped! It is a bit easier due to this , I've been having ultrasound & was hoping for a cortisone injection in my knee joint, but they won't do it, saying risk of infection to high( which I don't believe)
Yesterday I went out for a little. Walked for about 40 minutes, my symptoms are still there, & feel like it wants to go back to Square 1 at any moment, and my knee swelled right up! Today it's back as it was before yesterday.
My life is just on hold! Can't plan anything, petrified to go back to the last 10 weeks, can't see how I can go forward????? Stairs can only be done once a day not using knee leg!!
My other knee ( hip leg) swollen now from strain
Really depressed and desperate!!!! Any clues???!!

"I don't know whether it's the WEATHER (a foot and a half of snow here with more on the way) or WHAT, but I have pain in my shoulders, elbows, fingers ( all new pains ) as well as continued pain in my lower back since our GREEN CHRISTMAS was replaced by SNOW GLOBE JANUARY.
The suddenness of all these new pains in new places SEEMS to point to the WEATHER changes, but I also wondered if others in not-so- snowy climates ever experienced NEW pain areas once your KNEES were replaced.
I've thought about possibly having overworked my shoulders and elbows using my walker then cane in each recovery period. I also STILL rely on my upper body to help me out of chairs. ( I had my first TKR seven months ago and my second TKR three months ago. Both knees doing great.)
I also thought about possibly taking MUCH LESS pain medication recently since my knees have felt really good. Maybe these pains WERE there before but masked by the PAIN MEDICATION I was taking more frequently in thironic. I use Ibuprofen.
Any additional thoughts out there?
Anyone experiencing this?
It seems so ironic to me that I FINALLY get my KNEES done and pain eliminated THERE only to have NEW pain places start up!
Osteoarthritis...you are EVIL!!!!

"Well, today is officially 7 months post TKR on the left knee ... like many others, I have to say that this discussion group has been a life saver - especially in the VERY dark early days! I had a lot of scar tissue that made a bend nearly impossible and had a manipulation in August of last year at bout 12 weeks ... this was definately the turning point for me as it enabled me to work with PT at getting a really good bend (by the end of PT it was 128 degrees - altho a little less now I believe since I am no longer pushing it) and right now I can do most things in terms of climbing stairs fairly normally - still need to hold a handrail as well as coming down normally - again with a handrail and more slowly than I used to. The bend enabled me to do more of the kind of exercises (like biking) that strengthen the quads - which is the 2nd issue I had. Due to some unknown cause - tournequet too tight, for too long ... or residual muscel weakness from previous surgery ... the quad was totally out of commission for the first 6 weeks after this surgery and would nto support me ... so like starting to learn to walk with that leg all over again!
I saw someone else on the forum a few days ago mentioning balance issues ... I certainly felt that way too (better now for the most part) but that was right up until 6 months post op ... even going up onto the curb or 1 stair when there was no handrail put me off ... I felt unsteady. They sure don't tell you about all the 'extra' stuff that you can experience, do they?
right now, my main issue is lack of confidence out of doors - since I live in Canada and we're enjoying a late start to a snowy winter (we had a green xmas and I 'loved' it!)... I am just afraid of slipping and falling on ice (especially when it hides under the snow) and have not gone out too much ... just car to office building or car to grocery store, etc and I walk like I am 106 years old .. which isn't good either as you tend to hold yourself too ridgid, so if you DO fall ... etc .. ... I have two dogs which I used to walk at least 2 x a day in all weather, so I know they are missing that ... but I feel like the extra risk in being pulled at the wrong moment isn't worth it ...
I also find that relative humidity makes a huge difference to how the knee feels ... on high humidity days (especially cold ones) the knee feels like cement again (although it still bends with little difficulty) - it feels like it did back in the summer ... I assume this is normal?
Lastly - the clicking in the knee .... I don't think it is the artificial knee itself ... but could the ligaments be moving in such a way (not painfully) to casue that clicking sensation ...? more disconcerting than anything ...
I am compiling a list of questions to ask my surgeon when I see him towards the end of Feb ...any other comments are welcome ...
Going to be spending a month in Florida starting March 1st so am really hoping that once I get to warmer climes ... the old knee and the new one will feel more like my own again ...
thanks to everyone on these forums for making me feel that I was not alone ...unless you have been part of this 3-5% you really just don't know! xx

"Hey guys, new to this but was wondering if i could get some advice. Tore the meniscus in my left knee about 3 months and went to see my physio etc who recommended leaving the knee to heal by itself because im still young (20). Been given the all clear by my physio to return to sport and the cartilage has healed. However, went for a run yesterday and felt discomfort in the front/top of my knee. I've had a history of knee problems since messing up my ITB running a marathon. Anyway, I'm unsure if this knee pain is a result of the cartilage tear (and if it is, is there anything I should be doing) or just my knee flaring up again. Any advice is welcomed! Thanks!

"I am 42 yrs old and had a Partial Knee Replacement done on Jan 6th...outpatient...went to first PT the next morning. Wasn't too bad...2nd was a little rougher and I was in more pain. 3rd visit had a different therapist and she pushed me beyond what I thought I was ready for. She basically forced bended my knee and forced straighten it..said it's to keep scar tissues from interfering with recovery...this was extremely painful. I am curious to if this is normal protocol on your 3rd visit of PT..which was 7 days post op...I was in soo much pain I could not go to my next PT. Plus I have bruising on my ankle from her force bending with her body weight...I figured I would go back on Monday when my normal Therapist will be there....I have made progress with bending and straightening and don't think I should be rushed like that...I am still in alot of pain but am able to walk around house without crutches.

"Hi All,  I am five weeks post TKR surgery.  Back in April I had THR.  Both surgeries went very well.  I heal quickly.  I have been walking without aids for at least two weeks.  Going upstairs normally (with a little extra effort).  My ROM reached 115 degrees very quickly and when I went to FU appt with surgeons assistant I a at 120 degrees which she said was their goal anyway. However, my knee I am still super stiff. I start outpatient PT Monday and I am hoping this will help.  I've been doing my exercises, but the stiffness doesn't seem to improve.
One other thing, during the knee surgery it was confirmed I have RA.  My rheumatologist didn't know if I had RA or PMR.  I've been testing negative for RA.  I think from what I have read the RA should not be an issue in that knee any longer. Per my surgeon my hip did not have signs of RA
Still wondering about the stiffness, though.  I am hoping someone can give me some insight.
Thank you

"Hi all,
Went to see surgeon on Friday after writing him a letter listing down all the problems I am having after having lateral pkr last January. As I am still using crutches and still have pain on standing, sitting, stairs etc. He was very nice and also concerned as obviously I should be sorted by now. Xray is fine and shows nothing untoward. He says I can't have an MRI scan as because of the metal it doesn't give a good reading of what is going on. I am now on the list for another athroscopy as an investigative measure. Has anyone else had an athroscopy on their already implanted knee. I must admit I am a bit nervous about it. He said he hopes that he will be able to see what the problem is during the op and sort it but if not there is a possibility of me having a full knee replacement, Susan.

"I am so grateful that I came across this site.   
I just completed week 4 of recovery for my partial after putting it off for the last 8 years.  This has been quite a journey in which I never realized how lengthy and painful the process is.  I have 3 flights of stairs and pretty much did this solo.  It was really tough but in hindsight I think I pushed myself possibly harder than some out of sheer necessity.  I have had days where I am fed up with the pain and cry, then others where I am doing better.  Surrounding myself with company really helps to distract but by day's end I am done. The stiffness is what really gets to me because if I over do it then my knee starts feeling like it is thickening with stiffness than the pain sets in which I can only describe as feeling like a big throbbing toothache.  I went off any Meds over a week ago because I hated how I felt on them. My state of mind improved after getting off them.
I am driving now but can only handle short distances because having my knee (the right go figure ) in a fixed position for too long makes that gnawing pain kick in.  
Here are a few things that I purchased on Amazon that I found really help.  For walking, I use Trekking Poles.  They were inexpensive and they are retractable for travel. When outside I find them to be amazing with helping to keep my balance and I am not putting any weight on them.  I just don't understand canes.  
Another item that has really helped me with icing is the CryoCuff system.  I really like it because it is so portable and manageable to carry.   Last week I had my furthest drive so far due to an appointment. and was really nervous as to whether I could make it without being in blinding pain.
I took my CryoCuff with me on the passenger seat and was so happy that I did.  I only made it half way there when the pain really started to kick in and managed to pull off the freeway, find a parking lot, propped my leg up on the dash and iced.  After icing I was off and away again.   Hope these ideas help a little.
I am a very impatient person who wants my life back but I have to honestly say that when I reflect on where I was 4 weeks ago to now, there is a huge difference.  
POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING!  This will be a success

"I don't think this problem has been addressed in this forum as of yet, so I will start the topic of hair loss following surgery.
I had my first TKR in 2012, and noticed shortly after surgery that I was losing a large amount of hair each time I showered and blew it dry. I would gather up a large ball of hair from the sink after blowing it dry. After a couple of months, I was concerned enough to make an appointment with my Endocronologist that I see because I have had thyroid problems in the past. When I went to my appointment, she showed me that my bloodwork was normal. I told her that I felt there was something wrong because I seemed to be losing a great amount of hair. She said 'you had surgery on your knee recently haven't you? That's why you're losing a lot of hair'. I was stunned. She explained that anesthesia, some drugs and the stress of surgery put the hair folicles into a state of sleep. Anesthesia blocks the rapid cell division of hair folicles, and hair folicles are the most rapidly dividing cells in a human body. The hair folicles actually shut down and enter a 'telogen' resting state. The resting state results in the loss of hair. She added 'don't worry, it will start growing back in 3 to 4 months. Sure enough, she was right on the money. In a little over 3 weeks I noticed the hair stopped falling out and new hair was growing. I could actually see the 'baby hairs' sticking up in the part of my hair.
So if anyone that has recently had surgery and has noticed an increase in hair loss, take heart. It will return.

"Hey All,
I decided to start off with my first post hoping I can get as much as support that I could from all the experts in here. Basically, I'm 30 yo (not overweight) right now and I injured my left knee 15 years ago while playing football. If I recall correctly, I was making a ""volley"" stunt with my left knee as the supporting leg and I twisted it. Then I was out for the entire game and as it was painful and swollen, once the swell subsided I was able to walk normally and then I remembered my knee suddenly gave way when I was walking, it happened only 2-3 times since the first injury (first few months). 
At that point of time, I went to see an OS and he arranged a MRI scan for my left knee and results that came back was a partial torn on meniscus and the doctor said surgery wasn't required, got prescribed with anti inflammatory and that was it. I slowly regain my knee strength by jogging, running and eventually return to playing football, cycling, basketball and even gym with very little soreness everytime after I played. Usually the soreness last for few minutes and not much pain. I'm able to walk normally and run but the only thing that I can't really perform was squating/kneeling and walking down the stairs.. it will usually give me some pain or some funny feeling on my knee. Other than that, my knee feels pretty stable. 
So fast forward.. 5 years ago (around 2011), my knee swelled and I was a bit concern as it rarely swells and so I made another visit to hosp, went to see a different doctor this time and he ordered another MRI scan for me and results came back pretty much same and he said it was partial tear and doesn't need any surgical intervention unless the pain doesn't subside but this time he extracted the fluid from my knee to reduce the swelling. Results were significantly good, I'm able to walk normally since then and no more swelling, I still go to the gym and workout as usual with very little sore/pain each time after workout (usually soreness lasts for 5-10 minutes after stationary cycled) and then it goes off. 
Recently, I changed job and stop hitting a gym due to work commitment for about a year and then few months back I experienced some slight pain and my knee flares up and swollen pretty often. It goes off and keeps coming back so I went to see a different doctor this time and he ordered another MRI for me and based on the results, it shown some 'loose body' around my joint which may be the reason why my knee keeps flaring up and there are some gap within my joint, I guess certain piece of my meniscus is missing. So he suggested for surgery to remove the debris and I went to look for second opinion and the OS came back with the same recommendation but he said I tore my ACL too. I guess I'm all set now with not much options left, an ACL reconstruction using hamstring graft and meniscus repair. So here are my questions - 
My surgery is scheduled around March and I was thinking if I should bring it forward? I'm currently under prehab as my quads are weak but each time after prehab, my knee gets flare up and swollen again, should I just stop doing anything and let the swell subside and go for surgery with not up-to-par quads? My hamstring is pretty tight and painful at times too, happened 2-3 weeks ago which is the most worrying as I read in the forum here, some people have problems with hamstring after post-op. 
As I don't feel any pain previously and not much of mechanical problems with my knee, however I do feel some clicking on my knee and occasionally a floating object around my joints at times. I can't really flex my knee to 0 degrees which has been like that for quite sometime. I'm really worried if I have damaged my knee. Can that damage been accessed through MRI? or it has to be scoped?
Lastly, now my good knee is giving me some minor problems. I have not injured it before, no twisting, no swelling but I noticed everytime after walking down stairs, I feel soreness on my quads tendon/meniscus area (slightly upper right side of my patella) - not sure what is it called. Am I overusing my good knee? MRI screening comes back all normal.
Thanks,
Hertz

"Hi, I recently partially dislocated my knee while hiking. There was a pop, and tons of pain. After this happend the pain continued radiating from behind my kneecap whenever I walked down stairs or kicked towards something. An MRI was done and the Ortho who looked at it told me I had a ""stress fracture"" in the patella. I also have a copy of the MRI and all I can see is the cartilage of the patella looks damaged which would make more sense.

"Hi All, Help me out here.
I'm nearly 7 weeks post op TKR.  Have contributed and read every post on this site and the advise has been so helpful.
I have not missed a day of PT and see my physiotherapist once a week.  I walk x 2 (20mins), cycle x 3 (10-15 mins), exercise, ice and take painkillers.The pain is still quite harsh most of the time and I can only function with painkillers on board but I continue on. Last week my physiotherapist added ankle weights into my regime and I find that the pain is now worse.  Thought at the start that it was just the addition that was making it so sore and I could work through it. But the pain is getting worse and sleepless nights are not helping.
Should I stop the weights?
Take a day off from everything (except stretching)?
What do you guys think?

"Greetings, recently i've been having problems with my knee. I'll put up the pic where it hurts. So the pains started after I did weighted lunges. These pains occur whenever I walk or land after a jump. Also it hurts when doing lunges. The pains have been going on for 2-3 days. What could  this be and what are the treatments? Thank you.

"I have pvns, and have had it since I was 12. I have had 9 synovectomies, the last one at age 26 ( I now 44) then radiation after my last surgery in 1996. I was told at that time I needed a knee replacement, but they wouldn't do it until I was older. I wentered through cortisone shots, syncvisc, syncvisc-1, pysicall therapy and aspirations once a week for years. I have not rode a bike since age 12, and havent been able to run since then either. I had a total knee replacement on January 8, 2015 and today is the 9th at 2:11 am I am. I have not had ANTHING for pain since 1 pm (4 1/2 hours after surgery) I can bend my knee almost 90 degrees alreasy and have been up walking with a walker since I got to my room. I have almost no pain! I cried because for 32 years my pain has never been lower than a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. I feel like I have carried such a weight on me for that time and it was lifted off! I want to ride a bike, and run for no reason but just to run. Is this weird having virtually no pain after TKR? I f this us not a dream, I truly have experienced a MIRACLE!

"Hi,
I was squatting down at work when my knee twisted and I thought I had discolated it, the pain was excruciating! After a few minutes I tried to straighten it and it released. I had bad swelling for about a week then it seemed to settle down.
Since then it has happened about 5 more times and my knee feels really unstable. I have pain when walking up and down stairs and it hurts when I'm in bed. It's usually swollen at the end of the day and feels like it's hot inside.
This has been ongoing now for about 6 months and is really starting to make me feel miserable, I gave in and went to see the doctor this week and she is making me an appointment for an MRI.
Anyone have similar symptoms?
thanks

These were recommended by her surgeon and her physical therapist. I was encouraged to massage the scar area and use Vit. E but nothing was ever said related to anti-scar pads.

"Just got back from a cruise and up tell then did Therpy three times a week and was depressed all the time. I have kept up with all the stretches and exercises that I have been given and added amount and time to each. I had the surgery in Utah on September 19th and after three days in hospital then three days at home went straight to Therpy. We came to Arizona the third week in October cause we are snowbirds and hate the cold. iM 64 and have arthritis. I started Therpy as soon as we got here but they were both working for a different goal. UTah wanted me to hit 100 bent before I left ant thought my bend was fine. i hit 119 with the stretch band. They also said I had a small window to get the bend in, two months. I get here and they said I need the straight first and the bend would come in time but the straight only had a small window, two months to get in. I wAs also told the bend did not count if I had help holding it, well I was already in a depression mode (I don't get depressed) which I was having problems with and they mesasured me at -8 and 100 when I got here, depression got worse. I was so confused on what to do so I started at home combining what I was told in Utah and Arizona. things have gotten better and I do feel better. I have not been depressed since we left on the cruise and got home so I don't want to go back to Therpy, both places have the stretch Michine that for some reason I dream about and have cried more than once knowing I will be on it. I even push myself harder on my stretches and they hurt just as bad knowing they will put me back on it. What have you all been told about the bends? How long have you all went to Therpy? Before we left for the cruise I was at -1 and 109 without the help of the band. 
I do the wall stretches 
the band stretches pulling the foot over the back lying on stomach
the chair streaches
stairs streach
hanging legs over bed backwards streaches
pushing both legs into floor streaches
then I start the exercises which are eight different
kinds two reps of 20--stretches and exercises are twice a day.
i walk or do the pool or stationary bike twent to thirty minutes a day. 
like I said when reading others I am happy with what I am living with but still lost at what next and for how long?

"Hi,
I had a knee replacement in August 15 and generally have made good progress and did not suffer from too much pain. I had a slight hiccup at about 3 months post op and developed some intermittent pain around the knee cap which felt like nerve pain but this disappeared after a couple of days.
The latest problem is stiffness in the outside part of my knee which seems to make going downstairs slightly probelmatic.I have also developed some soreness which seems to come on after going downstairs.
Still have a very good range of movement in my knee, it is just the muscles which are tight and I am quite concerned about the sore, stinging pain which is very localised to a particular spot on the outside of my knee and sometimes feels like a stinging sensation.
Walking is not an issue so I am still able to walk distances.
I am not doing many exercises now and I have been discharged from the physio and the surgeon so it is quite scary to have no one to discuss this issue with, although the surgeon did say to ring him if I did any concerns.
I did go to a Pilates class on Monday and I did spend a long time inthe kitchen cooking on Tuesday afternoon, so maybe I have just overdone things.
Any thoughts or advice would be welcome.

"Happy New Year everyone! I am now 6 weeks after surgery (TKR, right knee), and have struggled on and off with achieving a satisfactory bend since coming out of hospital. A couple of days ago I thought I had turned a corner and felt the bend was better, but now today, I'm back to square one. It is so stiff I can barely bend at all. Im worried that my surgeon may recommend a manipulation under anaesthetic, but I'm really worried about this. Has anyone else had it done? How soon after your TKR did you have it done, and what sort of results were acheived afterwards? Thanks. Alison.

"Thank you to all that contribute to this forum I have found it so helpful over the last few weeks.
I had left TKR five weeks ago.  I am 66. Would have considered myself quite fit and not overweight.  I thought I would bounce back pretty quickly but I'm finding it extremely slow.  Thanks to forum I know I'm not alone in this.
Painkillers were a big concern at first but I finally decided to go with the flow and and take before by PT sessions, otherwise they just were not happening! Take sleeping tablets still too and still don't sleep through. Also new pain arrives on the scene as PT increases so now as well as post op knee pain I have calf, quad, glut and hip pain again thanks to forums that seems to be normal too.
I had 100 degrees coming out of hospital which I know is good and got it to 112 just before Christmas, but now feel I'm going backwards as knee is stiffer then ever (especially in the morning), than it was.  Whats that all about?  I do my PT 2/3 times a day and 2 x 20minute walks (now without walking aid),
Due to have other knee done in Spring.
Happy New Year to all
And thanks Again.

"Old injury now but having kneecap compressing into femur and pain with any squatting/bending of knee.
The bad knee has more kneecap laxity in all positions- meaning I can passively move it around more than the other knee- I can move it more toward the lateral side especially. This is measured when tention is equal on both sides to eliminate error. 
All this affects my walking too.
What muscle(s) would cause this?
I can stretch my rectus femoris all the way into my glutes while standing, but I feel kneecap pain as if the patella is not free, or where it should be. 
I've done everything for two years exercise and stretchwise. I also feel a blocking sensation and/or resistance

However he has just told me that he has been feeling depressed since he came off his painkillers 6 months ago. He has feelings of worthlessness and feels he is has lost interest in everything. He has been going through the motions and putting on a brave face. Is this normal after this length of time. He has not told anyone about it and is worried about medication however I feel that he needs professional support. He has never felt any form of depression before and is 54.

"I have been playing badminton for some 40 years which has resulted in quite severe knee pain in recent times.  Cartilage has worn away from under the knee cap and also the surface of the femoral groove, so essentially, I have `bone on bone` resulting in severe knee pain when I try to jog or do any sporting activities. Tried VMO exercises and undergone several months of treatment/manipulation from an osteopath with limited success.
To try and maintain fitness without putting strain on the knee I have tried cycling but the knee pain remains, however, I have started walking on a treadmill over the last few weeks and to increase the effort, I have set the treadmill on an incline and secondly, and probably significantly, I have worn ankle weights. I have noticed withing days, that my knee pain has reduced. I have gradually increased the weights from 1.2 kg on each leg, to 2.5kg on each leg and recently have gone up to 4kg.I am fairly convinced it is the ankle weights that have made a difference. I have set the treadmill at 3.5 miles per hour to resemble a brisk walk and walk for around 10- 15 minutes on alternate days. In case anyone is tempted, I would not recommend trying to run with ankle weights on as I am sure the extra weight will put significant strain on knee ligaments as the lower leg flicks up whilst running. 
I have researched on the internet and not found any evidence of anyone trying this approach for knee pain, so my account is a purely individual and cannot be used as proof this approach works, but i would think this is fairly safe and worth a try. If anyone does it it a go, I would be interested if they have found any benefit from this or not. Good luck.

" Hi guys and gals,
I had a UKR (Partial right knee replacement) on 6 Nov. Sent home on 9 Nov and progressed into rehab which has been fine ( but really demanding) and yesterday saw my Orthopaedic Consultant. He’s happy, more exercises for quite some time into the future; no crutches around the house, 1 crutch (as required) for up to 2 weeks maximum, can drive my car immediately I’ve done an emergency stop and back to work driving a bus at end of January.
Prior to UKR surgery and going back for several years I’ve had a right Sacriilliac  (Si) Joint problem usually managed successfully by Osteopathy to the point that right up until surgery I’ve been free of pain/discomfort. However, in the last 10 days the Si joint pain has returned. I am sure this has returned as a result of a number of things; 1) many of the rehab exercises and stretches which have aggravated the si joint, 2) walking for 7 weeks with crutches, bad sleeping position as a result of surgery and now walking solo with a slight limp. The offending exercises/stretches have been discontinued and the only ones I maintain now with agreement of consultant are flexion and extension exercises for the new joint.
After new year I shall return to Osteo for manipulation but meanwhile I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or similar and how you dealt with it.

"Firstly I hope you have all had a good Christmas with family and friends.  I have loved seeing my family.
I had to have a knee manipulation just over a week ago and since then I have had many positives including I can now straighten my knee totally and the bend keeps getting better.
I do believe there is now nothing wrong with my knee and it will eventually get better.  I was told to come off the Tramadol, which I did, I was only taking one a day and they are now finished.
During the day the pain is bearable most of the time but come bedtime, for the last 4 nights I have had almost no sleep (1.5 hours) approximately.  I am demented as there is no way that I can lie which is comfortable, I walk about the room, stand up, lie down, sit up, massage my leg etc.  nothing works and like now I just end up crying as I don't want to children to know but I don't think I can carry on like this.  I just take paracetamyl and Ibuprofen but think I should be raking something stronger at least for another week or two.  
I wasnt addicted to the Tramadol as only took 1 a day, but that seemed to help.
Do you think I should persevere as I am or try for something stronger.
i am happy with my knee and it is just a little bit swollen.  I forget to either use ice or heat.  Would either help with the pain.
thank you all once again.  4.06 am here in UK and I am shattered but sleep is eluding me.  Pain is side and back of knee, ankle and now hip.  Any help very much appreciated.

"I first ruptured my ACL in September 2011 and the hamstring graft failed about 12 months later. I had the patellar tendon graft put in 2 months after this and it has been ok since then. I have recently had a lot of difficulty with my knee. I was sprinting in a straight line in a game of soccer and my knee clicked on the medial side, I stopped playing straight away it was very painful. There was no swelling at all until about 12 hours later. Since this injury there has always been a full range of movement but it is painful down the inside of knee when I straighten it, when I bend it there is no pain at all. All I have done since is walk I have not started doing anything more than this, generally walking is ok but quite often it feels like my knee is catching down the inside and this is painful enough to make me stop walking. It is very uncomfortable. I went to see my doctor and my physiotherapist who carried out the usual tests, they both said that the ACL felt strong and agreed with what I thought, which was that I have a tear in a cartilage in the medial side of the knee. I was referred to my surgeon who again carried out the tests, he seemed reluctant to say what he thought was the problem and said I need an MRI. I asked him if he thought it was cartilage and he said it could be, but it could also be that the ACL graft has loosened. This has made me extrememly concerned because since the incident where I've reinjured my knee I have never thought that there was a problem with the ACl. It seemed to me that the surgeon thought that the ACL had loosened, but he didn't want to say until we get the MRI results. My knee never give way or feels particularly unstable. It is not painful to bear weight. Can anyone shed some light on what it means if the graft has loosened? And do you agree with the surgeon's opinion?
Thanks so much, James.

"Well folks, I am six months out from my first TKR and two and a half months post op from my second TKR. Time flies!
I keep a journal to remind myself of all I have endured during this adventure, but, more importantly, I also record all of my progress.
I think my best measure of progress has been NOT THINKING about MY KNEES constantly throughout the day! I find myself going about shopping, household activities, standing and talking to my neighbors in the yard, and cookie baking for four hours yesterday without having to constantly SIT DOWN! What a relief it has been to just DO THINGS I want to do!
I am 64. I had always been very active. About six years ago I noticed that I needed pain medication (Ibuprofen) before my walks. My five to six mile walks began to turn into three or four miles at a time. I was not enjoying them as much as I had before due to pain. I didn't check with a doctor. I just thought I was getting OLD. I rationalized the PAIN as just AGING.
A couple years later I DID go see a specialist. Osteoarthritis was the diagnosis. I took more Ibuprofen, had a cortisone shot that lasted FOUR DAYS, and just began giving in to the fact that I would have to stop my walking, take it easy, and stop doing a lot of things like long shopping trips, gardening, etc. I became even older in my mind.
I remember writing ""I wonder if AMPUTATION would get rid of this pain."" Yes, folks, I was at THAT point!
My big "" Ah-HA! Moment came when I woke one morning with shooting pain in my left knee. I could NOT put any weight on my leg! I walked around with CRUTCHES for a day and a half waiting to be able to call my specialist after MEMORIAL DAY weekend. He took X-RAYS, and my knees had worsened GREATLY in the FOUR YEARS since I had last seen him. (Since the cortisone shot hadn't helped, and my insurance company refused any Ortho-Disc shots, I had gone into DENIAL...until this shooting pain stopped me in my tracks.)
Fast forward to my appointment with my specialist. I expected him to say that since I had jumped through all the previous hoops (PT, cortisone shots, been rejected from the Ortho-Disc shots), that my NEXT step was arthroscopic surgery. Several of my friends have had this as THEIR next step.
MY surgeon simply shook his head and said, "" Cheryl, THAT ship has SAILED. You need KNEE REPLACEMENTS."" The new X-RAYS were FAR WORSE than those just four years before! I was now walking on about an inch if bone-on-bone on both knees. Cartilage was gone. No wonder my balance was bad!
Of course my doctor said I could have surgery or do nothing. Those were my choices.
I scheduled my surgery before I left his office. The rest, as they say, is HISTORY! Three weeks later I had my left TKR. Four months later I had my RIGHT TKR. Of course there was pain, rehab, LOTS if PT and exercising and ucing and ELEVATING of my legs. There was using the walker and the cane and getting those STAPLES removed, which was NOT FUN at all! What I want to say, though, is IN MY OPINION it was all worth it many times over!
I have my life back. I can shop for hours, garden all morning, talk with my neighbors, bake cookies, and think about all those fun things instead of thinking about MY KNEES!
I am SO GRATEFUL that the horrible pain hit my left leg that morning because it jolted me enough to get me out if my ""Poor Me"" attitude. It caused me to DO SOMETHING!
I hope that any if you who are in denial as I was will read this and DO SOMETHING to help yourselves. Pain all the time just sucks life right out of a person. You become older than you really are. You start to give up. I know this because that was ME!
I am so grateful that I endured the two TKR surgeries and am now my regular self.
I hope this will help give hope to others who are thinking there's nothing that can be done. There ARE things that will help!
Sending prayers of HOPE to all today!
Merry Christmas from me and from my two NEW KNEES!

"I am 8 wks po tkr on my left knee, had some complications like a blot clot and bad infection at first and didn't start pt until I was almost 2 wks po. Pt is going good and I'm walking pretty much without any aids, driving and only taking pain meds for therapy. I drive a truck for a living and I'm almost positive my surgeon is going to release me when I go to see him on the 31st. He will not give me anymore pain meds and had a problem giving me the last ones on the 4th of December. My surgery was on November 3rd. My bend is at 100% finally after all the problems I've had and I don't feel I should be released yet.

"Hi everyone,
Merry Christmas to all of you.  I am now 5 weeks post op on a UKR (partial) right outside knee.  Doing well. Full extension and 130 degrees of bend.  Still having alot of tightness. I was wondering if anyone uses heat on their knees instead of ice. When I do my home exercises my knee feels really good during and for about 20 minutes after I am done, then it starts to tighten up and gets hard to bend.  Also I was wondering what you could suggest for breaking up the scar tissue at my incision. Still have about 3 places that are still very tight. Even my PT therapist has been working on it and we just can't seem to get it loose. It really pulls at the incision area.  Thanks for your suggestions.  May you all have a very blessed Christmas.

"Hi, All!  I am 6 days post PKR.  Just had my other knee done in September. I have been struggling with a muscle ache in my leg since right after surgery. I think maybe from the nerve block. Anyway, they finally found a medicine that relieved it in the hospital but said I wouldn't be able to continue it after I leave due to the blood thinners. I am taking 2 Percocet every 6 hours and about 3 hrs in it wears off. They told me to try 1 every 3 hrs but that was like not taking anything!  Now they are letting me take 1 Celebrex every 12 hrs. Has anyone else had this pain??  I am icing too!

"I had a TKR of my right knee in 2014 (early in the year). I did well for about a week and a half. Then pain increased, my ability to walk decreased. My wound opened began draining at about 5 weeks post op. I did exactly what my surgeon suggested ( no wound culture, no tap, no antibiotics, worked hard to febrile a get the wound closed. Constant, unimaginable pain.....exponentially more than initial post op period. I told him repeatedly I felt that it was infected, that I felt I was having too much pain. Day 85 post op I could not touch my foot to the ground without excruciating pain. Labs showed likely joint infection and tap of knee confirmed it.
1 week later joint removed and antibiotic spacer placed.....worst day of my life from a pain standpoint. Went home with a PICC line and 8 weeks of IVantibiotics, Groin to knee immobilized ....I lost 55 pounds, my eyelashes and lots of my hair. A new knee was placed after 12 weeks and went as planed. I'm left with neuropathy in right leg, ongoing knee pain as well as pain from the neuropathy. I hear people say "" I tease arched my surgeon so I didn't have problems""...so did I. ""I did antibiotic showers and had antibiotics after so I didn't get infected"" so did I. I did exactly what my surgeon told me and did my PT so I didn't have any problems""....so did I. I'm left with pain and made to feel like it's my fault. My other knee is just as bad....is anyone pain free after this? My right leg is ruined....terrified to ""fix "". my left. I did my best; why can't people accept that I didn't cause this?

"Hi all! I had mpfl reconstruction and chondroplasty with patellar microfracture a week ago. In English that means that I had cartilage removed from behind my kneecap, holes drilled into my kneecap. Also my dr made a graft from my hamstring to rebuild the ligament that keeps my kneecap stabilized. I'm still on 10 mg oxycodone and also got my staples out today. My dr also gave me a prescription for flexeril. I wake up at least four times every night with very painful spasms. They're in my calf, in my thigh, around my kneecap, everywhere. The flexeril doesn't seem to help and according to my dr and the nurses, they're normal. And I'm sure they are, but they're still painful! And the more it spasms, the more it swells. I can't bend it at all because it's so swollen. I'm keeping it iced and elevated and only get up to shower or use the bathroom. Any ideas?

"I am a 15 year old female. I do gymnastics twice a week and swimming every weekday. The past few weeks I have been experiencing pain more often than usual in both my knees(usually only one knee will hurt at a time). For the past 2 years I've had occasional knee locking but it would only happen maybe once every 3 months for an hour. but now it's many times a week and even though it won't completely lock up like before, it will still hurt and the pain will get worse as I walk on it to the point of where it will completely lock. I will try my best to sit down before the pain gets worse but sometimes I am not near a chair or bed. The pain usually lasts for an hour. I've noticed that if I pop my knee either by accident or on purpose, it will cause it tohave pain later that day.Even when I sit down my knee will still hurt until it's had an hour to rest. I don't know what's going on. I know that gymnastics is probably making it worse because swimming doesn't hurt it at all. I know it would be good to quit gymnastics but it's my passion and I would like some other options before I am o my left with the choice to quit.i just want some answers on what it may be so I could bring that up when I go to the doctors soon.

"I have been to see my specialist today for my follow up and he is not at all happy with the bend in my knee and thinks I should have manipulation almost straight away.  He would do it tomorrow if I wanted.  Initially he thought the bend was just 70 degrees but it is 85-90.  The thought of having this done straight away is too much for me and I would rather try to get dome improvement on the bend.
i saw a different Physio prior to the visit to surgeon and thus one was excellent and gave me different exercises to do to try to improve the bend.
can anyone give me their thoughts on this.  I am totally depressed by this and just don't know what to do for the best.
I have ordered a set of pedals, like a recumbent bicycle to also improve the bend.  This should arrive on Monday.

"9 wks TKR and am getting so confused over exercising. I was getting along slowly but surely ,then last week in physio I went on a cross trainer machine as I can't yet do a full rotation on bike. I think I've overstretched as back of both my knees have been aching for days! I have severe arthritis in my sacroiliac joint, fibromyalgia, a sacral nerve implant for bowel problems and also needing second knee TKR soon. I'm wondering why physio thinks that after one TKR I should be able to use these machines when I've never used them in my life before. The last 2 yrs I've shuffled round as my knees were so bad so even walking was very difficult. I've been doing my exercises at home regular and have this week been in the pool doing water exercise. Physio tells me one day I'm doing too much and to ice and elevate, next time they're putting me on a cross trainer!!!!! 
I really need some advice on how often and what specific exercises now at 9 weeks + and 100 deg bend. My knee feels very stiff every time I start walking and both the backs of my knees are really aching. 
Im just getting in a bit of a tizz with myself at the moment and soooo tired too

"I have attended my training session ready for my TKR.   Some of it was useful, some of it a bit depressing.
However, the physios were listing the things that had to happen before you could be discharged.  In addition to the usual things such as getting up and down stairs, washing and dfressing yourself etc theyt sais you had to reach 90 degree bend a straight leg.   I am sorry but reading on here I just do not beleive it.  They say they are able to achieve this by really pushing you.  As they reckon to discharge you one, two or three days after op wonder how they are going to achieve this.  Did anyone reach 90 before discharge?

"My husband is two days short of 4 weeks PO Bilateral TKR.
 No swelling, bruising. Immediate PT. In the home 3x's a week. He does all his excersises daily. He is not over-doing, icing regularly, takes his meds. In two days it will be 4 weeks. He aches continuously behind his knees. Dr. said it took a lot to straighten. Something about the sacs (I might have this term wrong)
my husband has been walking without walker in the home for over a week and today walked outside to the end of our block. I think this is what he needs, as apart from PT and getting around the house, he is in bed, lounging...which is good, but after walking he felt a bit sick. Not off pain meds, but cutting down.
it is behind his knees that hurt so much. He is 53 yrs old.
has anyone else felt this?
 Our Dr. Is truly renowned. I had both hips replaced by him, anterior procedure.
Any words of encouragement?

"Six days after MUA and 14 weeks after TKR and I feel due to the MUA I've gone back quite a bit. I was recovering well and strengthening my knee and was able to walk quite a distance and have been back driving for 8 weeks. My bend was as low as 65% and under the MUA my surgeon got it back to 95% to 100%. However, on discharge my knee has certainly stiffened up again and my range is probably back to about 80%. The exercises are so tough and I have to take as many painkillers as I can to do them but I now have pains in the my new knee that I haven't had since three or four weeks after the TKR! I'm a bit miffed but maybe I should accept that my range will never be much better than what it is now. My surgeon said as much saying that everybody is different - some can't walk as well as I can but can bend their knees normally. Help!

"Not suggesting, TELLING me.
I am a 52 year old male who is active with walking and tennis. I recently developed knee pain , from what I believe was caused by stomping on the brake pedal of my car quickly and forcefully to avoid a wreck.
After a long walk i developed sever pain the next day.
It subsided a little but then was swollen and got a cortisone shot at my first appt. 
On a follow up I still had some pain so I got an MRI done. 
On MRI consult he infroms me i have a 1-1.4 centimeter “medial posterior horn meniscal” tear and says ""you are getting this surgery"".
I have researched this quite a bit since then and am not understanding why the words ""physical therapy"" were not used at all whether in a positive sense or a negative sense.
Later when I called the Physician assistant I asked her more details and she said that some people don't get any improvement after physical therapy.
I also asked Dr. about the pain. I feel pain on the left front side of my right knee but he says that the mensicus tear is in the back on the posterior horn.
I have looked at the MRI and compared it to others and do see the white mark which is typical of this diagnosis but it seems so light and faint compare to other tears i see online.
Also my knee pain is subsiding even though I did 2 full days of brush mowing in a field 2 weeks ago and played tennis last night.
Its strange , when i start playing tennis, it aches a little but when i am done i feel no pain. !?
I am contemplating whether to get this surgery or not. I don't think my tear is sever and worry about getting arthritis years later from having some of it removed.

One thing I would like to ask is does anyone feel a little vulnerable when walking......I have times when I just walk normally and then I remember what's in my knee and it makes my stomach flip over in fear......stupid or what?
I must say that since my op I have become acutely aware of everything around me......people rushing about, steps, uneven ground (my worst nightmare is tumbling!) but I'm hopeful that even if it takes a while, I'll soon be treating all these things as normal!

"Hi everyone, I went to see my consultant yesterday and although everything is in place and as it should be, it seems I have inflammation of the tendons around the implant. I had a partial knee replacement on the outside of my left knee 7 months ago and have been experiencing pain on sitting an standing. He said it should have all settled down by now and wants to see me again in six months as there is not a lot he can do to remedy it. The question I would like to ask is, are there any other pkr's out there who have had the replacement on the outside and if so have they experienced any problems with it. The consultant said that partials on the outside are very rare and in their infancy and that they use the prosthetic that would be used on the inside of the opposite leg, in my case the right leg, ( hope that makes sense). This, he said, is the reason for the inflammation, as there is a very slight overhang over the bone. Thanks for reading. Susan x.

"I had all the usual pre-op tests (again!) yesterday, & had the longest apointment with my new surgeon since seeing him in June. The op. is booked for the 27th October. He is stripping out all ligaments, but the ones he replaces them with are not hinged ones, as suggested by another person awaiting a revision, he said they have a tendency to loosen around the 5 year mark, so uses another sort (which I can't find online). He was not going through the usual ""this may not work"" line this time, infact, I left the hospital pretty upbeat, as he said he is aiming to give me what I should have ended up with when I had the primary TKR, i.e., a knee that works. He said I should be able to kneel, get down again (& more's the point - get up again) to play with my young grandchildren, stairs will not be a problem etc etc. I should be able to walk our 2 lively dalmatians (we adopted them as 7 yr olds just 6 days before I had the TKR, & I have never had the stability to walk them) - he also said the ""buckling"" would stop. This has cheered me up so much. Of-course, I will have to work hard - my main ""job"" now, pre the revision, is to try & de-sensitive the right side of my knee - by brushing, massaging & generally touching it all the time, no matter how much I hate the pain/feelings.
SO- for the 1st time in almost a year - feeling positive.

I am supposed to go back to physio on Monday, Aug 31st ... should I expect to be able to do more or will the swelling inhibit that? what about walking around ... were you able to get around as well as before or did this set you back a bit ... wondering do I get my husband to bring the walker with him when he comes to pick me up or will cane suffice?

"Hi fellow knee sufferers! I'm 12 weeks post TKR and saw my surgeon today. He has suggested (recommended) that I undergo MUA asap as my knee bend isn't what it ought to be. I understand this involves the manual procedure then being put on a machine overnight in hospital then intensive physio. My concern is that of course my surgeon cannot guarantee if it will improve things or to what extent it will if it does. He has also said it will cause pain but can't say how much and how long for. I've done well over the last 12 weeks in other ways. The wound has healed well, I can fully straighten the new knee, I have been driving for six weeks and I can walk for at least an hour with virtually no pain in my new knee. I just wondered if anyone has undergone this MUA procedure and if so, what was it like? I'm in two minds whether I should do it or persevere a little longer with more physio. Help!

I had my clips taken out yesterday so I am now without a dressing. I was told it was OK to get it wet but still very worried about this.
Just wondering how others got in in at this point in time.Wound does not look a pretty sight and I know that I probably need to leave it a few more ideas but what would you recommend to promote healing of the wound.
I have heard bio oil, vitamin E cream and a lotion from Boots to help with healing.
Any feedback would be welcome.

"I'm nearly 22 weeks po new plastic knee cap/metal trochlea. Knee is definitely improving and am working hard to improve muscle wastage which has, since op, been a big problem for me. I've posted recently about ""when will it feel like mine?"", but can I also now ask does anyone suffer with severe stiffness first thing in the morning. One lf my biggest problems is the pain I experience from the crook of my knees up the back of my legs to my bum! I exercise on static bike to try and loosen up (feels like hamstrings are tight, something else I've also posted about!). Will this pain eventually (hopefully!) disappear the further along I progress on this journey?
I apologise for all my questions......but everyday I think of something else to ask!

"Hi all, saw my consultant today and he told me that the level of wear in my knee is such that I will need a total replacement. However, because of my age (61) and because I am active, he is reluctant to send me for surgery until all avenues have been explored. To that end he gave me a steroid injection in the hope that this will give me a few pain free months. I've had this before and to be honest it only lasted a matter of weeks so I'm not overly confident that it will work this time around. I see him again in April when my condition will be reviewed but he has said that the next step will be total replacement. Here's hoping the steroid injection works.

" Hi all, I'm now 8 wks post TKR and finally feeling more emotionally stable! Thanks to the help and encouragement from this forum. I started off with a 60 deg bend and am now at 100 deg so progress is being made. I've just found a great little gadget to help me exercise so thought I'd share it with you. I bought a little exerciser which is basically a pair of pedals on a small frame and I sit and eat my breakfast or look out of the garden whist sat on a chair peddling merrily away. I'm building it up from 5 minutes  to 10 at the moment. I've found muscles in places I didn't know existed but one day at a time I'm getting stronger and it is loosening that tight band round my knee.

"Had my first check up since I had TKR on July 1st. I didn't have a 90 degree bend when i was discharged after 6 days and i still don't have it now. Despite that i am relatively pain-free and hop about fairly briskly. So today I was really worried about seeing the consultant with my lack of ROM. However he was mainly concerned with my ability to straighten my knee! Typical!
My other knee is actually worse than the knee I just had replaced so that is permanently bent and he is concerned that the new knee will also end up bent if i don't work at it.
He said my scar was absolutely excellent. If it is of interest to anyone in the UK i have been using Boots scar reduction serum three or four times a day since the clips came out.
I have to go back in three months and hopefully actually see a physio who will help push me to get this knee right and avoid anything like MUA. He mentioned me needing the other knee done but i said i wasn't ready to go through it all again right now. This has already taken over my life and been hard and I wasn't ready to go through it all again until knee number one is fully useable. He said he didn't blame me. So... Back to the grindstone for me.

"Hi Everyone,
I know I promised to update several of you on my progress (or lack there of) following my TKR in Feb then follow up operation after burst wound, failed MUA as leg was likely to break due to ligament issues etc. Leg still hovers about 80-85 on bend and -30 on a good day for extension.
Well I saw my surgeon today and I've been able to delay the next step until early next year so I can go away to celebrate my mums 70th in Dec. Biopsy's were clear so I don't have anything else going on. I need a TKR revision that will also include the removal of all my ligaments and hinges put in their place. There's obviously a higher risk of complications with this so I can't have it done until I've seen a Haematologist (I am anaemic and have other blood issues...all new since Feb). I also need to get a second opinion so my surgeon can be sure he's doing the right thing.
I was quite pleased when I left the hospital as I'd wanted to delay it but now it's sinking in that I'll have to cope with this pain and deterioration for another 6 months. I am sure I'll cheer up again tomorrow as I wanted some control back. I'm just a bit panicked now as I'm replaying the conversation.
I know this next step is going to be even more difficult than everything I've been through so far. This is apparently the last step for me. The outlook after this is not good for my leg but I'll spare you all the horror stories. I'm trying not to think about it.
Anyway I'll leave it there.

Apart from the obvious questions, I was wondering if those of you who have been through this experience have suggestions for questions that YOU would have liked answered but didn't know to ask before you had the op, if that makes sense?

"My physio recommended I try cycling (stationary). As I'm still unable to fully rotate the pedals she said to go ""forward and backwards"", rotating them as far as I could until, eventually, I would be able to rotate fully. 
All was going well until a few days back when my un-operated side foot slipped off the pedal which allowed the TKR side to fully rotate.
Well, ouch to say the least!! It killed (not literally obviously), but it hurt greatly may I say? After a few tears popped out, and much gnashing of teeth went on, my leg ached tremendeously for a while and swelled quite a lot. I immediately iced it and rested (and haven't been near the bike again).
My question is, could I have damaged it? Now the flex I'm able to do is less than before and the pain, while not too bad, is certainly a little more. 
Thank you.

I have been told I need a PKR because of my OA and Meniscus, I am now bone on bone.  I was told at the end of April it would be September, which I was happy with, now it seems it may be November.  I have contacted the CCG because their website (updated in May, probably just a week or two after my initial consultation) was quoting 42-49 weeks.  I'm pretty sure when I made my choice of hospitals it did not say 42-49 days otherwise I may well have chosen to go elsewhere!

"Oh blimey, just when I thought it cudnt get any worse, this has now hit me like a ton of bricks. Am nearly 21 weeks po new knee cap and trochlea. Knee is very slowly improving (I think!) but still occupies my mind until I fall asleep. But, my mind is all over the place. Doc prescribed me sertraline anti-depressants but after I'd talked to him I felt a little better so have not started them yet. I also have fibromyalgia so for 3 weeks had been taking 10mg at night, but I was sure they were making me more weepy, so rightly or wrongly I stopped them and am currently taking nothing......apart from paracetamol. But, I'm also menopausal, night and day sweats are awful, and in the night I'm constantly taking covers off or pulling them back on again. I seem to be in a vicious circle......am I depressed or just menopausal, I don't want to start taking tablets for depression when it cud be menopause, or vice versa, and naturally my fibromyalgia doesn't help!
Every morning from about 5am untill noon I'm very weepy and then I seem to get myself together, but during that time anything and everything sets me off.
Is anyone else experiencing anything remotely similar? I'm so scared of going on anti-depressants and then not being able to come off them. I'd so just like the old me back!

He said he could see I had been exercising properly because of the state of the scar and muscle tone. He discharged me and also from Physio as he seemed to think I was just fine on my own. However 4 weeks on, I haven't achieved a better bend. My knee still feels heavy. I think it straightens ok. I had a bad weekend but I did much more last week. I walked much further and for longer and I also put resisitance on my exercise bike. Other people on here seem to be much further than me and I am now worrying that I am not doing so well after all.

"I am almost 8 weeks post TKR - initially i experienced severe weakness (read no movement) on my quadricep muscle on the operated leg. Now - finally I am making some progress with the strength, I have graduated back to a cane from the hated walker and am much steadier on my feet. The issue, however, continues to be the bend. I have 80 degrees and can bend it to 90 once it limbers up in the morning - but anything beyond that - with PT manipulation is very painful and just plain cement-like. I will be going to see the surgeon again on Aug 18th - about a week and a half away.... I don't hold much hope of a miracle in that time period. The PT has said that in all liklihood the Dr. (whom he knows well) will want to do the manipulation. Part of me says ... hey, if it gets the knee moving and brings me one step closer to getting back to normal ... isn't that a good thing??? the other side of me says .... it took 5+ weeks to get some strength back in the quad ... will this ..or could this - potentially - do more damage??? I don't know what to think ... looking for some advice from those of you who may have already had an MUA .... lastly, the PT said - basically if you opt out ...and we can't get the leg past 90 ...then he can't really recommend continuing with physio on the Government's dime. private PT (on top of the massage therapy that I am already paying for) will get expensive very quickly. My insurance at work does not cover it.

"Hi Everyone,
I enjoy this forum so much. I'm in the U.S., but we all suffer the same from TKRs..
I'm 13 weeks out from 2nd TKR, though getting better little by little. My nights are still awful. I get this feeling in my legs besides the deep ache, of not getting proper blood circulation. I usually end up worrying I'm going to get a clot, so I get up and pace the room. I also still have the overly sensitive soft tissue that hurts when a pillow or sheet touches it. I am awake all night and then can't wake up in the morning. My sleep pattern is all off. I'm so thankful I am not working at the moment. I have been trying to cut down on my pain meds, but tonight I ended up taking an OxyContin and a Percocet. Still awake and it's 3:40 AM. I do my stretches and physical therapy exercises but I'm so frustrated it's taking so long to feel normal again. My first TKR was in 12/14 and went much smoother than my right knee.
Thank you for any advice. I read this TKR forum daily. So helpful to know I'm not alone! What's up with the doctors not understanding the sleep issues we have? It seems worldwide!

It was so swollen I had to ice and elevate for 48 hrs on instruction from physio.I went into an emotional meltdown crying for days, poor hubby couldn't speak to me without me bursting into tears. I thought my knee was going to stay that way and that I wished I'd never had the op. One week later I'd taken the advice from OFG and done my exercise well hydrated and also did them more slowly and stretching, I also bought a packet of ibuprofen.I went to physio and lo and behold I had 98deg bend. I'm doing so much better, my spirit has lifted,I really must of needed to cry it all out, my walking is better and I think I have a better mental balance between exercise and rest. Physio said it can take months to get maximum bend.My fav exercise is pushing my bend into the bottom of my stairs,that seems to loosen things up well. So just for today I can see the light at the end of the tunnel

"It APPEARS that wearing compression bandages or compression stockings is NOT accepted practice at night/ overnight.
Instructions say to REMOVE THEM before going to sleep at night.
A week ago NOTHING, I mean NOTHING was relieving my swelling, and the swelling was SUBSTANTIAL!!!
( I am five weeks out from my Total Knee Replacement.)
I decided, ""What the heck...I need to do SOMETHING! I got out the bandages from my surgery. I had washed them, dried them and thought I would keep them handy for my NEXT surgery on my other knee a few months from now.
My plans changed when I started handling them.
OK...so I TRY to follow rules. I TRY to do what I am TOLD to do by package instructions and by doctors.
However, there comes a time when desperate situations require desperate measures.
I put on those compression bandages and WENT TO BED.
(I have to be honest...I stayed awake WAITING and EXPECTING something BAD to happen.
Guess what?
I drifted off to sleep, slept through the normal time for my pain medication, AND I woke up with FAR LESS SWELLING than I had had in many days!
Yes, you read that correctly...FAR LESS SWELLING!
I have been wearing the compression bandages at night for a week. Each morning my knee AND my whole leg feels better.
I am able to move more, am able to take less pain medication, and at PT sessions my lessened swelling has helped me do a much more successful session achieving more bend and more straightening.
All of these things have helped me be able and feel confident walking around in the house and even out in the yard WITHOUT. my CANE.
I wanted to post this because I think that sometimes you just have to take a risk. I did, and IT REALLY HELPED ME!
(I also have faulty valves in my veins due to bad varicose veins. My aches from THAT have also lessened greatly.)
I hope this helps others. Pain and swelling are NASTY THINGS! I am hoping to find ways to GET RID OF THESE NASTY THINGS!

"Hey all,
I was diagnosed about 3-4 weeks ago with what was possibly a bakers cyst in my left knee. The pain disapated but Saturday evening I was playing hockey, I was standing in front and I went to turn to go after a puck, and my skate was caught in a rut. As I turned a felt a pop in the left knee and searing pain through my knee. I tried to push off to skate and was met with pain in every stride. I hobbled back to the bench. The pain Saturday night and Sunday was non stop and about a 6 on a scale from 1-10. I can't straighten it completely or bend it past 90 degrees without pain. A majority of the pain is in the back and along the sides of the knee. There isn't much swelling. But the stability is compromised a bit if I try to turn on it when I walk. The pain isn't too bad today, but still hurts bad when I go from sitting to standing.
I'm really hoping it was the cyst rupturing and I didn't tear anything in it.
Anyone else ever have this happen?

"Hi,
English is not my native language:-) My 14 year old has been dealing with knee pain for 18 months. She is a very active volleyball player and jumps a lot. Her pain started slowly at the lower-middle of the knee. And increased during the time to about 2' under the knee. She just took 3 weeks off. And had 2 practices and the pain is really bad that she can't really play / jump. I have taken her to few ortho specialists. She had x-rays last month and even MRI about 18 months ago. Both specialists claim that she has growing pains and nothing is wrong. But how can be nothing wrong when the pain is so bad that she can't play anymore. We are also going to PT, chiropractor and nothing helped yet. She is using foam roller daily as instructed. Her pain gets really bad when jumping. There is little bit of pain on the lower side of the knee. But mostly about 2' below the knee on the chin. Any ideas? Thank you very much.

"I had my TKR just over 5 weeks ago and have been on leave since then. There was a 2 week section in the middle when I was on ""holidays"" but nonetheless I have not returned to work since the operation. I have to say that I still at this stage feel totally incapable of working at my job - at a computer - I am always feeling the need to change positions ie from up to down, and from down to up, which I cannot do once I return to work. Also, by the time I complete the required exercising, walking, icing, physio appointments and dr appointments, the day is practically taken care of.
I'm wondering how long people in my situation have had off work. I saw one post some time ago where the patient said they'd had 12 weeks off but I'm wondering if I should be moving back to work yet or am I pushing it?

"Hello everyone, I am new to the forum.  I will be having a left total knee replacement on Sept 1st.  Nervous but anxious to be able to function again.  Some of my concern is that my right knee also needs to be replaced and may make it difficult getting around with my new knee.  My doctor was quite honest with me about recovery, he said that I'll stop hating him around 8 weeks post-op.  Kind of gives me a time frame for recovery.

"i have not posted that much on here but have sought solace in reading about all of your recovery after TKR. 
I feel a tad guilty as I only had a partial Knee replacement at the end of March. Regarding my recovery this has gone slowly but I am now seeing the light at the end of a very long dark tunnel. As well as my knee surgery I have had cataract surgery on my eyes lol boy am I getting the most out of the NHS and I'm not 50 till next year!!
i am due to go back to work in a couple of weeks on a phased return but I am dreading it!! Would like to know how you all got on going back after such a lengthy time off. 
Thanks

"Hello everyone... I left the doc/surgeons office with a smile on my face. He told me the reason I'm not passed 90 ROM is cause of the custom knee they had to make for me. He the custom knees take a lot longer to get ROM. And I've been released to go back to work on lite duty!!
Only problem I had is when I came out of the doc's office I had a flat tire on my truck
Hahaha but I changed it myself to see if I could do it.
Thank you to everyone of you for support

"Hi all, havent been around much for a little while, but I have a question, probably aimed more at the TKR ""Veterans""!
My scar is about 8 inches in length, and the bottom half is like Mary Poppins - Practically Perfect in Every Way! However, the top half, as my title suggests, is nothing like as good. The appearance, to be honest, Im not too fussed about. But the past couple of days its been stinging, almost like a pin being stuck in it. 
Anyone else experienced anything like this?
AND....for everyone who has supported me and given me words of encouragement, my Daughter has had her kidney surgery (which was WAY more of a major procedure than she anticipated), and she came out of Hospital yesterday. In heaps of pain, and enough meds to strock a pharmacy, but shes home! Her Surgeon was extremely good, and instead of only being able to remove 70% of the stones, and having to do a follow-up procedure in a few weeks, he managed to get everything out. 
Hope everyone is having a good, (relativeley) pain-free day xx

"Hi fellow TKRs! I've had a bit of down to earth moment in the last few days. I've been getting on well walking quite a lot, all round strengthening and improvement in my knee. I'm 11 weeks post TKR now. At the weekend my wife and I had two days in London and I enthusiastically walked a lot, doing the tourist thing. Anyway, boy did I suffer. My knee was swollen and sore (haven't had real pain in the new knee for weeks). I couldn't sleep and was very down. Gradually it has come back again over the last day or so but I guess I got too complacent and over-confident. To top it all, my 'good' knee, which is bad with arthritis, decided to play up too! Thanks for everyone who has supported me in my previous posts. Finally, on a personal note, so sad to hear of Cilla Black's passing. I grew up with her music and that of the Beatles et al in the 60s. Sad news.

Excersises on the bed before getting up, then on my legs all day apart from dinner, coffee breaks. My knee is coping apart from stiffness at times and some aches and pains.
But I'm outside at work wearing ankle boots or loose socks in wellingtons and by the end of the day my leg has a swelling that stops just before my ankle looking rather strange as if Iv had a tight band around it.
Any ideas, is this normal. Am I doing too much.
But I have to work !!!

Knee seems ok but for the last three days my unoperated knee has been ""twangy"" and I've shooting pains up the back of both of my legs. I've carried on doing the exercises the hospital gave me straight after my operation and I'm taking 10mg of amitriptyline at bedtime because I also suffer from fibromyalgia, but these pains up the back of my legs are a new problem.

"I'm nearly 19 weeks po new knee cap and trochlea and by the time I see my consultant on 20 August I will have been off work 5 months. I honestly don't feel anywhere near ready to return, I work in a office and am up and down from my desk all day. At the moment I'm still having to do my exercices to try and build my muscles up due to severe muscle wastage, and I'm still so tired all the time. I've also had fibromyalgia since the late 90's and my knee surgery has definitely exacerbated this. As I'm 56 I now have the chance to take my pension and I must admit I'm beginning to favour this option. I'd like to ask if anyone else decided to give up work since having a new knee/s. I've been feeling very depressed about my lack of progress and very scared about re-entering my ""working world"". For the last few days I've been very weepy and the ""panic"" I feel when thinking about my situation scares me to death. I know I'm probably not alone in feeling like this and in a few weeks time I'll probably feel different again, but at the moment my mind seems to be in turmoil.
I've gone from being a confident get up and go person to someone who only feels safe in her own home.......and I don't like it. The only good thing is I haven't half saved some money 'cos although I'm at home all day, and do have my own car, I'm too scared to go out and about on my own into town. Stupid or what.......I had this knee done to improve my life and at the moment I feel like it's ruined it.
Any advice would be much appreciated.......and I apologise for the negative tone of this post!

Had an appointment with my surgeon for the results of the MRI & EMG he ordered. It seems I have nerve root compression (medical term for pinched nerve) at the second & third vertebrae., which of course controls the quads.  My options are back surgery or spinal injections, not thrilled with either choice. Will make an appointment for consultation with spinal surgeon and listen to what he says.

The blood test came back nearly 'normal' only 8 pointss over 51,   but a lot better than first diagnosed with fatty liver at 537 in April 2013.  The liver numbers were coming down Oct 14- 160, April 15 after the op a rise to  260..Had a scan, that proved goo showing nothing.. The reason for blood tests has proved that the meds I took, including anti inflamatory, caused the upset.  BUT while I was there I talked about not sleeping and that this was not just me but seemed to be everyone who had this op, the doctor was quite suprised to hear that...anyway result is I have 14  tablets to take one very night, don't leave a night out, this should get me back hopefully  into a sleeping mode.

"Thinking back to when I first had enough PAIN in my knees to find myself ALWAYS FOCUSING on where it was hurting, what I MIGHT have done that CAUSED me pain, and how I was going to GET RID of my pain, I realized that it all started when I was on my knees getting Easter decorations out of a low cupboard in my classroom. I SAT BACK WITH MY KNEES TUCKED UNDER ME, and suddenly felt EXCRUCIATING pain in the backs of both knees.
I had NEVER felt this BEFORE, even though I had often moved in this same way at this very same cupboard. Fortunately it was after school was out, and my classroom was NOT filled with second graders! (I MUST have SCREAMED pretty loud because it wasn't long before several of my co-workers came running into my classroom.)
For DAYS the back of my knees ached and hurt. I vowed that I would NEVER EVER move that way again!
Over the years I have tried to figure out what the heck happened. Why THEN? Why the PAIN?
I have had people mention Baker's Cyst, muscles, ligaments, stray chunks of bone that migrated to that area, etc., but even with my left Total Knee Replacement being done four weeks ago, I CONTINUE TO experience the same annoying and painful feelings in the back of my knees.
I worry that I went through my TKR to ELIMINATE my pain yet CONTINUE to have these issues in the back of BOTH of my knees.
Anyone out there experiencing this?
Anyone have ANSWERS to what the heck is going on?
Is there a type of BACK-OF-THE-KNEE surgery that is done FOLLOWING TKR surgery?
The backs of my knees feel like there are these ropes that move all around every which way. Sometimes the ropes all lay flat and BEHAVE THEMSELVES. Sometimes, however, the ropes get TWISTED or one becomes shorter, and I get very sharp pain without even kneeling.
I want what EVERYONE here wants...Knees that DON'T HURT!

"On Saturday I felt pretty good, 57, 20 weeks post op Bilateral TKR. I went shopping for several hours with my daughter. I was walking without a limp at a fairly normal pace! My daughter said to me, Mom your doing great, just don't be overly confident. It was a great day! The next morning I was leaving the house to go for a walk, when my left ankle turned under and I heard a snapping noise! Thankfully, I didn't fall. I did, however sprain my ankel. Painful! Went and had an x-Ray, no fx just a sprain. Ok, I can handle this, which I am. My left knee, since my mishap seems to have lost a month of recovery. Was feeling so good. Just found it interesting how the ankel mishap has really affected my knee, even though I didn't fall on it at all. I know it will get better, but annoying and unnecessary. So be careful! This recovery is a roller coaster all on its own, we don't need to add in any more bumps!

"I've posted on here before but as my journey continues I keep having more questions so....here goes....what kind of meds are people in Australia taking? I was started in hospital on Targin and Endone (I'm now 6 and a bit post-op) and have been taking Endone (repeat prescriptions from the GP) ever since, along with 2 panadol. I have been taking these 3 times a day, before exercise, the last one carrying me overnight.
My question is this:
I'm due for another script but now have experienced a different kind of pain - more along the lines of hyper-sensitive areas (they feel like someone is rubbing sandpaper on the area) and wonder if it is nerve pain that a relative experienced following TKR number 2. If so, should I continue with the Endone or move to Lyrica which she was prescribed. My brother also has a bulging disc and he takes Lyrica for that. 
I hope someone can suggest what I should do. Drs appointment tomorrow and want to go ""forearmed"" with some information.
Are other people still taking pain meds at just over 6 weeks?

"Hey all,
Over the past month, I've developed knee pain. It's odd because it doesn't hurt too much when I'm walking around or playing sports, but when I sit down for a while, it stiffens up and becomes extremely stiff and painful to straighten out. The pain radiates from the back of the knee.
My PCP looked at it and felt the back of my knee and said I probably have a Baker's cyst.
The pain hasn't been as bad the past week or so.
My question is is will this clear up on its own? Will it be something that comes and goes?
Thanks

Instead after my 3 months of physio i opted to pay for some private treatment (laser treatment, electrotherapy and ultrasound)where i was also told they thought it was tendons/ligament aswel as the torn cartilage as ialso get trouble with my hip, anyway i started to see.some improvement gradually but sadly couldnt afford to carry this treatment on so unfortunately im back to square one, ive got an appointment with my gp again and hoping to get referred to a specialist now, just wondered what other peoples experience with something like this has been, and what the outcome was?

"Hi. I've posted two or three times before. I'm nearly 10 weeks post TKR. In many ways i'm pleased in that I can walk without pain, up to an hour at a time so that is good. However, the knee is still very stiff and hard on the outside of the knee. I can drive my car no problem but going downstairs still isn't possible in the normal way (i.e. I can do one step at a time). Going upstairs is better. I can't sit with my knee at right angles like my 'good' knee. I do exercises at home two or three times a day and am trying the tea-tray technique! I feel that I fell in a hole in terms of post-op support and didn't get physio until after five weeks. This entails a gym but I can't ride the static bike, though treadmill is no problem. I also have to combat spondylosis which brings on the occasional sciatica attack which is evident when trying to go downstairs normally. However, I used to get sciatica attacks down my left hip, buttock and leg (the operated leg) within a few minutes of walking - this has now disappeared, only the occasional sciatica attack when sitting, but not in the leg. I still feel tired quite often. I weaned myself off of co-codamol a week ago and take paracetamols 3 or 4 times per day and naproxen for my back pain. Sorry to ramble on but am I doing OK or not? I see my surgeon's physio team (at a different hospital) in 2 weeks then the surgeon 2 weeks after that. I just want the stiffness to go away!

"I'm 5 weeks post op for TKR. I had what I take to be the usual swelling when I first came home. Only last week, I managed to get my shoe back onto that foot without a huge struggle, but since Saturday, the puffiness has returned and the whole leg seems just a bit tighter. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm a bit worried that something may be going on. I've struggled with movement in the joint since I came home - mainly due to the swelling I feel.

"I am 7.5 weeks post-op and can walk several miles with my cane but walking without it is a problem. Taking a few steps moving from room to room or working in the kitchen is difficult as I have to get psyched up, leg straightened out etc and some momentum going before it is comfortable.  Outside once I get going i am only good for short distances before I start to sag to the operated side and my back hurts. My physical therapist has diagnosed it as a weak hip abductor and I'm sure she is right - she has given me exercises, so hopefully they will help.
I am curious as to what it is reasonable to expect and what others have experienced.

"Hi folks
I damaged my knee in just before Xmas when I fell in a rather nice European city, walking up the steps to a designer shopping mall...I was knocked by a guy...and fell....corner of marble step versus tibial plateau of knee ! 
Thankfully, I was xrayed at the time, and no bony injury was seen. However, my knee was black and blue with bruising lasting and lasting. Since then, I have been unable to fully bend or straighten my knee, and its exquisitly painful when I walk up a slope, or climb the stairs....down is sore but more than OK...up is a different level altogether ! 
Being a health care professional, I left it as long as I could, carrying on with my shifts, in the firm belief that the gentle exercise and movement I do all day everyday, would aid its healing and promote healthy healing if at all possible. 
However, its not improved...so I went to my GP who informed me that I was ""too old"" to be referred directly for an MRI...Im 48...and I had to go to orthopaedics first....no worries thought I...except I didnt see a consultant...just another GP with an orthopaedic certiificate. 
My GP and this Dr both did the McMurray Test and its positive. 
He sent a letter to the consultant recommending an MRI, which i was able to get quite quickly.
The report says I have a meniscal tear. 
But, I'm being referred to physio. No worries there either, except I am now being discharged from orthopaedics. Yep, not even seeing a consultant, so cant ask questions, cant ask where the tear is, and the nature of it, and discus the options of treatment or not. 
SO, Im unable to tell the orthopaedic consutlant that I had ankle reconstruction sugery on the same side, and physio is going to be very problematic. 
I've aslo been told to take analgesia.
Well...how on earth do they think I've survived this long...
Its 7 months for goodness sake, ...not weeks  !
All of the information I can find on the ""interweb"" regarding referral to physio with regard to meniscal tears, implies that the injury is new, and that things should calm down 4-6 weeks after the injury when the pain is mild to non-existant. 
I have not had a good nights sleep since Xmas, sleep with a pillow under it, and have a knee that still produces bruising and swelling after all this time...
I dont like to say I've been let down, as I work for the NHS, but I dont feel as though I'm receiving the best care, and am being put on a ""conservative management"" program without actually being consulted. 
I've not seen a consultant or registrar, and today in the letter I received, discovered I'm not going to...
Would be most grateful for the opinion of other health professionals, physios in particular with regard to meniscal tears ""healing"" after this time....
AND when the pain is slowly increasing...the ourcomes I can realistically expect....
I will go to physio ""with bells on"" if it'll work on the MENISCUS
if its just to strengthen other muscle groups...how does that actually help the MENISCUS ? 
Dont worry, I am seeking a second opnion, and have decided to pay for an orthopaedic consultation, because the NHS has failed to provide that for me...

"I only recently discovered my docs knew about the bakers cyst some time before telling me! I only discovered they knew about it last April when I finally began physiotherapy this May. Anyhow, last December the damned thing ruptured. I thought I was in pain before but crikey! This was a whole other level. However, I followed the docs orders. I rested. I took regular hot baths then applied cold compresses. I took anti inflammatories and Zapain (co-codamol). Then I finally met my physiotherapist. Unlike my doctor he didn't nag me to lose weight. He listened when I talked about pain and asked me what I wanted to achieve (be pain free) then told it to me straight. ""Show me you are willing to try to do what I ask and I will help you"". So, once a week he gave me an exercise to try (back at work by now and walking in pain even with buckets of zapain), starting with pushing my heels to the floor then pointing my toes, then sitting/standing then squats, then stepping up, standing on one leg - a new simple strength building exercise each week to add on. Then he handed me over to an instructor in the gym. Lovely lass. Just the same undemanding encouragement. Cycling on an exercise bike, then step ups on a 1 inch plinth - 9 inch now! Balancing on a wobble board. Squats. Stretches. Bridges (on my back pushing up my hips) slowly she rebuilt not just muscles but more importantly my confidence. Monday I was discharged under SOS (next 3 months, any issues I go back, no need for gp re referral). Now I walk without my stick! I walk quickly and I stand upright. I can walk upstairs AND downstairs one foot to each step and I can do it with poise and control. I do all the exercises 3 times a week (30 minutes) and at least 3 on other days. I do 12 reps x3 sets of everything (1 set of 8 to start). I take 1 single naproxen each morning. Yes I ache a bit if I have a long day. Yes I sometimes have a bit od OA pain but I do not have that terrifying agony of the cyst. Amazing. So if you are starting physio - take a deep breath and get stuck in! Also, due to being ao much more active I lost 20 lbs since that first appt back in May!

"Hi. I read many of the posts on this forum and it is great how people emphasise and support one another. I'm 9 weeks post TKR and feeling low. I don't think I've felt good since the operation. Some good days, better than others, and always feeling tired. I've spondylosis to content with too so I guess the double whammy of sore back and post-op knee is not good! I can walk OK with my knee, up to an hour, and have been driving for three weeks. My big issue is with bending. The knee is still very stiff and hard. I can't walk down stairs normally nor can I ride an exercise bike. Maybe that is no big deal but I'm only about 75% where I think I should be in terms of bending. I've tried weaning of Co-Codamol (nearly there) and that has been bad too, with flu symptoms appearing when I scale back too quickly. Sorry for the moans but feeling down and wondering whether things will ever be OK. Off to the pub later today to cheer myself up. At least I can sit at the bar!

"Hi all!
Well I got to 3 months post surgery, notwithstanding all my previous moaning and groaning, tears and insomnia.
I do find though, that I am stiff when I've been sitting, and go to stand up. The knee just doesn't respond as quick as a 'normal' knee.
I can't stand for too long - need to then sit.
I think I've developed a bit of a limp, but I don't care too much if I have. Not sure if I walk that way because I'm 'aware' of a new knee, or because I am used to limping from before the surgery - psychosematic maybe?
I ache a bit when I bend my knee backwards - normal?
Also, and this is a biggie ... do you all do your exercises religiously from this point on? I've been getting slacker and slacker, although I do get into the spa every day and do bicycling, leg lifts, knee bends and other stuff I can do in the shallowish water.
Thanks for your comments!

My passion is tennis and my current knee has reduced me to ""geezer"" tennis. I'm 66.  To be honest I am really surprised with the amount of people posting so many post-op problems. Perhaps it's only the people with difficulty that are motivated to write in the Forum. The more I read everybody's post the less motivated I get to go under the knife.

"About 4 years ago I had a massage in Thailand. At one point the therapist applied high pressure with her thumbs at my leg crease (front of hips). Sorry for my poor location description, but that's part of what I'm here for. I don't know exactly what to call this location or what she was trying to do. Was she trying to massage my lymph nodes? Apply pressure to my femoral artery? Who knows. But she applied a lot of pressure and it really hurt. Trying to remain manly, I only gasped a little and withstood her holding it for 10 or 15 seconds. 
When I started to walk home, I immediately got pain in my left knee. It felt sort of like my knee wanted to give while I walked. It felt similar to the tingly pain you get when your leg ""falls asleep""; under my kneecap and extending down through my shin. I feel like I want to drop my foot, but I don't. There seems to be some warmth and tightness radiating up into my thigh too. For some reason I didn't associate this with the massage. The pain continued for several weeks, then dissipated. A few month after I returned to the US, returning to work at a job where I'm seated all the time, the pain came back. Again, it felt like my knee wanted to give. Sharp pain, general weakness. 
I went to see a sports chiropractor. He said my pain description made it sound a little like peroneal nerve damage, but that usually only happens to people that spend lots of time on their knees like carpet layers. He tried the therapy anyway, and it seemed to help. Gradually, over about 3 years of careful knee care and physical-therapy type exercises on my own, my knee seemed to be back to normal.
Until last night. I'm back in Thailand (don't do massage anymore), and I'd been walking around all night, a little tired. I played a game of pool, and sort of threw myself back in defeat; sort of like jumping for joy; bending at the waist, and there was some sort of pop in that same leg crease area of my left leg. My old knee pain was back. Not it's worst ever, but pretty bad.
So I suspect the massage 4 years ago was the cause of this. My questions are how do I discuss this with a doctor or online advisors? What nomenclature should I use? Do you have any idea what it might be? What was she trying to do? What could she have damaged? What can be done to fix the problem?

"Hello,
 For the past year, I've had a chronic condition in which the area outside my knee, mostly below the patella (the little gap area), gets sore and painful whenever I ride a bicycle.  It also hurts when I run, and especially when I get down on one knee.  Kneeling can instantly trigger the pain, which is sort of a shooting / throbbing type pain.  I'm afraid it has something to do with my meniscus.  Doesn't sound like an IT band issue from what I've read.

How many times per day do you do them? and to what sort of intensity do most of you practice them? Do you take the gentle or firm sort of stretch approach or do you do them aggressively, in other words press as hard as you can and then a bit more? Can it be counter productive to do them to hard? And Do you feel there is benefit in taking a rest day throughout the week?In your experience, Do you find that as your Range Of Motion increases, do the exercises get easier or do we have to work hard for every degree of flexion?

"16 weeks post op today (new knee cap, metal trochlea). Problem has always been muscle wastage, knee and scar healing fine. But for last 3 days I've had lots of pain, knee is so stiff and my other, supposedly ""good knee"" has been ""letting me go""! I am so disheartened, been very weepy for a few days, scarey thoughts that I'm facing having other knee done, woke up during night virtually scared to death that life is not going to get any better than this. Last week I thought I'd turned a corner, apparently not. I wonder if I've perhaps walked too much and not exercised and iced enough. Does anyone else sometimes feel like I do.......i.e. your whole day can be taken up exercising, resting, elevating, icing.......and you just get fed up with it all? 
I really did expect to be feeling so much better than this at 16 weeks......considering I'd been told my op had a quicker recovery time! It's my wonderful hubby's birthday today and we've been out for lunch, but all around me were people getting on with their lives......and I was very envious. I know from reading posts on this forum that I'm probably not alone, it's just that today I suddenly feel like I'll never be ""me"" again. I even miss work.......I must be feeling bad lol!
Hope tomorrow brings less pain......more gain!

Everything was all right and I was relatively pain free but somehow because my husband kept fussing and asking if I was feeling all right I completely lost it and we ended up having a big row and coming home without any shopping done. Then I have spent the rest of the day crying for no apparent reason. I told my husband I am fed up of being held back because he says I need to take it easy. Also so sick of everyday being about knees. It Is 12 months since my first operation so feel like for the past 2 years all we have discussed is my knees. I just want to be back to normal. I know my husband is as baffled as I am and wonders what life has in store for us next. Does anyone else feel like this ? X

"Hi everyone.
8 weeks post op and seen consultant today.  He's signed me off as is happy with bend, straightening etc, but one question I asked was the problem I have in my foot.
I'd describe it as a burning, tingling feeling almost pins and needles, almost numb. It happens when my foot has been on the floor whilst in sitting position on a chair.  After a while it feels like my foot will blow up, despite moving around occasionally.  It's not confined to any specific part, just feels like the whole foot.  I can't go back to work because of it as it is so uncomfortable (and if i have to sit for above an hour it affects me overnight and the following day).
Anyway, he said he didn't know what the sensations are and I asked if it could be nerve trapped/damaged and he said 'could be anything, could be referred pain from my back'. (Now I don't believe it's that as I have never had a problem with my back at all) but then he mentioned 'or could be from the tourniquet' before changing the subject.
I didn't think about what he had said until afterwards but the bits and bobs I've turned up since on Google seem to confirm this.  However, most are written in medical terms which I don't understand!
Has this happened to others, and if so, is it permanent, or how long did it last? and is there anything that can be done to ease it? My husband suggested a tens machine - not sure if this is appropriate but if it is, does it go on the foot, or where the tourniquet was placed?
Sorry for all the questions but any help would be appreciated.
Thank you, from one of the Susan's!

"hi again
Just had my 6 month check, X-rays all good, blood tests ( for infection) negative, but still pain when walking, it becomes very sore and inflamed within a few minutes. Eases when I rest and sit. Surgeon just says it should get better in time , soft tissues healing etc..and doesn't want to see me until the 1 year mark. I have rested it for the last 4 weeks as suggested by my physio with minimal exercise to give it chance to heal, but am still in the same position. I was a fit and healthy 61 year old and looking for a light at the end of this tunnel! 
Has anyone else improved significantly after the 6 month mark? My understanding is that most people are doing much better by this stage? Can't help wondering if something is wrong, but have to try and stay positive and trust my surgeon. Interestingly, it seems more sore after drinking wine?!!!! 
Any thought / ideas welcome.?! Catherine

"Good morning everyone.  I'm just over 3 weeks TKR and I have some questions regarding exercise - I have been given various ones - sliding knee on bed, lifting leg with straight leg, lifting bent leg etc - ideally  how often during the day should I be doing these?
Also, if my knee is feeling painful BEFORE doing the exercises (ie on a really bad day) should I still continue and do them?  
And lastly, when sitting down, it's really uncomfortable with feet on the floor, it's really uncomfortable - should I be pushing myself to carry on sitting like that or should I just sit with it raised?

"Nearly 3 wks post op for TKR, had posted how low I felt after 1st physio session last week  ony having 50% bend and felt like my foot was glued to the floor. What a difference a week makes!!!  This morning I woke up and my foot and leg lifted from the floor for the first time. Physio had asked me to try and get an extra10% bend by this week and today when I went I'd achieved a 25% extra bend, and was told how well Im doing. So am now at 75% and they anticipate I'll get 110% soon. I couldn't have done it without the encouragement and support from you all here, especially when feeling so low, Thank you everyone for your support, let's keep moving forwards together and helping each other

It makes my calf very tight and although knee is obviously preventing knee bend ( it's 102 at moment) the cyst is holding it back too.

"I'm nearly 16 weeks po from patellafemoral replacement (new plastic knee cap and metal trochlea). For 11 years prior to op (and because I was considered too young, I'm 56 now) I wore a knee support, which essentially did the job of my muscles.
My knee on the outside is healing nicely, and I understand inside it can take longer, but I do have lots of muscle massage. I cycle on my exercise bike, use my stepper and try to walk normally (easier said than done when all I can think about is the lump of metal/dead weight in the middle of my leg!). I'm also attending weekly physio sessions.
My question is......is anyone else out there suffering muscle wastage, what exercices are you doing to ""wake up"" the muscles, how many weeks are you post op. At 16 weeks is it normal to be struggling like I am?
I was told my recovery period would be shorter than PKR or TKR......not sure I should have believed them!
Some days my knee feels much stronger, better than before op, but on other days its very ""wobbly""........and the tightness that usually returns every evening is horrendous. Anyone got any tips?

Been busy reading the forums here and struck by how friendly, helpful and supportive you guys are.
Not sure what to expect really post op - judging by the forums a
lot of ups and downs, pain, sleepless nights and feeling generally downhearted some days.
I have a couple of specific queries - I know there are no hard and fast rules and everyone is different but on average how long is it before you can:
a)  Drive
b)  Go on a long haul flight of more than 11 hours
Any other information most welcome!

"Hi everyone.
I'm 7 weeks post TKR now and my physio signed me off a week ago telling me to continue with exercises I had been doing - doing the simple ones if I was having a bad day or the harder ones on good days! He said I could use exercise bike and try swimming in a few weeks.
Since then I have managed to use the exercise bike backwards and forwards, though it takes a few minutes rocking backwards and forwards till I can get it going.  I don't stay on for long, but do it 3 times a day - but it does feel good and loose afterwards.
My question is - is this better than than the stretching and bending exercises, ie can I do this instead of them, or should I be doing it as well as?  And if it is as well as, which are the best ones to do too?  I also have short walks, but still have one stick.

feeling a bit fed up (as we do)
i am 11 weeks was feeling pretty good, but then started to think about how my knee was actually feeling and looking.
i have a lovely keloid scar which look wise doesn't really bother me but when I bend my knee I am still getting that ripping plaster or sharp pins feeling all on top of my knee.
does anyone else get this still at nearly 3 months.  I use bio oil daily but feel that this ripping feeling has not changed since day one.
Also I feel my knee is not as painful but it has this strong spring robotic feel to it , 
how does yours feel if you can separate the pain and the motion.

Wondering if this is not the knee but perhaps a tendon or ligament injury. Will be seeing specialist next week.

"Hi,
Had a very slow recovery from TKR in Feb 2014.  Required a Manipulation after 6 weeks and probably was a full YEAR before I felt less pain than before the Op.  Should point out that I'd had over 20 Ops across both knees over past 40 years and was told at age 30 that I would need 2 new knees but they wouldn't do them till I was 55.  Had first one done at 53.5 so got in early ;-)
Was obviously very low after the Op as I got A) An abcess the size of a small country on side of face (from under a tooth) - Then B) Came out in Hives when someone changed the type of Laundry powder (I generally change powder every time one is on offer and never had an issue). 
Was physcologically beat after 3-4 months as saw NO improvement despite taking huge amounts of pain trying to get knee bending.  Good news is I did come out the other end and suddenly my knee started feeling like a real knee again. Around 12 months post-op I realised I wasn't feeling any arthritis pain (in that knee - still plenty in the other).
Whilst I'm very happy with where I am now, I still have an issue in as much as I'm 19 Stone and really have to bash the Cardio to keep my weight even half way manageable (I was 17.5 Stone with 7% Body Fat when I played professional sport aged 30).
I have been using an Eliptical x-trainer 5 times a week for an Hour each time burning 1000 Calories per session.  I can use this method but am scared that I may be wearing out my knee as it's equivalent to about 30KM per week at quite a high resistance (to burn 1000 cals).
So I started to replace the x-trainer with swimming thinking it maybe even less impactful and, in an hour, I'm only swimming about 1K.
Here's my problem - Due to shoulder injury (from contact sports back in the day) the only stroke I can really do (for a prolonged period) is Breath Stroke.  I'm now concerned that it may be the WORST stroke for people with TKR as it involves kicking the legs from the knees and they're not always in-line (like when doing freestyle)
So my quiestion is - Does anyone with TKR do long stretches of BREATH STROKE swimming and has it had any negative effect over the long term?
I'm annoyed that even though I can bend my knee probably to somewhere near 110/120 degrees, I still can't get ""Over the Top"" when trying to ride a bike without pain and swelling.  If I cycle 1KM on the flat at very gentle pace, I can't walk for about a week as knee swells 12-24 hours after bike ride.
Being that I'm not a small chap - What exercises could people recommend where I can burn plenty of cals without wearing out my TKR
Thanks for any/all advice

"Hi there, I am new here to Patient forums, first post. Hoping to find some answers as I've yet to find any.
In 2011 I was snowboarding and on my first run of the day I whipped out. I had hurt my knee but decided to keep boarding for a few more hours. Then night my left leg was bruised and swollen from mid calf to above my knee (I might be able to find some old photos). 
I went to the doctor and got an X-ray then an MRI and told it was only soft tissue damage and they wasn't anything they could do about it and just told me to rest. I took it upon myself to get physio therapy but the treatment seemed pretty lose and my knee did not improve. I remember being in hot yoga a month after the accident and my knee retained so much water that I felt it jiggling inside and the instructor told me I should stop. 
Fast forward 5 years later and my left knee is still swollen to this day. Some days are worse then others and I can't figure out why. I have discomfort in the joint when nearly walking up a hill. I haven't been able to exercise like I used to and that's frustrating to me. I am 25 and frustrated that my body has not fixed this ""soft tissue damage"". 
Has anyone experienced something similar? Any ideas for treatment or self treatment? I am beyond frustrated and will take any suggestions. Thank you.

"hi all,
now 10 weeks and my knee has gone tight not like the first weeks of a very all round tight belt - this is like its sticking on top as I walk, could it be tissue healing and tightening or my wound tightening and putting pressure on my knee cap.
i suppose I am wondering is this another part of the healing, one day a strong flexible knee and the next stiff and weak.
the weather is very hot at the moment could that be affecting my knee?
oh dear one step forward, we could all make a song out of that one !!

"So, 14 weeks on from new knee cap and metal trochlea and I've had two days this week when the tightness seemed to be getting a little better.......until yesterday! I was out at a garden centre and pushing (more like clinging on for dear life) a trolley. Nothing heavy in it, just a couple of small plants. Had lunch outside in the lovely weather and came home. A couple of hours later my knee was very painful, tight and the pain was all around my knee cap. I took extra strength painkillers, iced and elevated. When it came to bedtime I couldnt pick my leg up off the floor to get it into bed, it was so painful, and even turning over in bed has been a nightmare during the night. This morning my knee is very stiff, a bit swollen and is painful on the outside of my leg up to my thigh.
Could it just be the heat, in my friends car the sun was very hot on both my legs (I did have linen trousers on so scar was covered), did I just do too much in pushing the trolley, could I be dehydrated......lots of questions going through my mind. Anyone out there experienced anything similar? Am going to rest up today and watch tv.......is there any tennis on anywhere lol?

"Thanks to everyone for their kindness and good wishes. Surgery went well but he found a couple of things that weren't expected. There was small crack in the top of the tibia which will require me to wear an immobilizer and use a walker for a couple of weeks. I will only be allowed to use just a toe touch method of walking during that time. Before surgery I discussed the scar tissue that was left from the steel late and screws he found a few inches of muscle that was fused to the bone and wouldn't move causing a lot of pain. His explanation made a lot of sense. He said he just sliced it off the bone so ur can heal properly but it will probably create as much discomfort as the knee but will stop the pain that it had been causing and heal properly. Well, I just hit the button for for the pain meds to kick in so better stop Before the spell starts looking like a 6 yr old. Thanks again for the well wishes

"Hi Everyone,
I'm 14 weeks post TKR and I've been told today that I need an MUA and arthroscopic Adhesiolysis. I have an extension of -30 and a bend of 80. Prior to surgery I had -30/50 so it has improved, obviously not enough though as I'm still in pain due to the angle of it.
I had a complicated surgery and don't just have the 'normal' TKR prosthesis. I have some other bits to strengthen the leg. My surgery took almost 4 hours.
I am actually really relieved that I need further surgery as I was starting to think I had done something wrong. My consultant said he considers it urgent for various reasons (one being I'm only 36 so the longer it's left, my muscles will strengthen considerably).
Whilst I know all about MUA, I haven't read about anyone else on here needing the Adhesiolysis (which is basically cutting the muscle away from where it's stuck). Has anyone had to have this done?
I have been told they hope to do this by keyhole but they may need to open up the leg again to reach parts.
I'm just interested to hear if this has been successful for anyone else.

Everything going ok, scar healing nicely, and I've been massaging scar and surrounding area with vitamin E oil and bio oil. Doing exercises, particularly on static exercise bike which really 'loosens' up any stiffness! However, as day wears on my knee goes really stiff and I can barely bend it.  I don't trust myself to walk on it, and I am currently using a stick to enable me to hobble about!  It is very frustrating as I'm reading that this type of surgery has a quicker recovery time than TKR. Is all this normal..........or am I expecting to much too soon?

I will have to have a knee replacement at some time but I am terrified of this opertion so I have read a lot about it so that I am as informed as possible.
I am puzzled by the statement that it will never fell completely like a normal knee that I so often read and wondered if anyone could try and tell me how it feels different.
I have had a hip replacement which had to be redone but it feels pretty much like a normal hip apart from the occasional ache so I am just curious about why a knee replacement feels different to a normal knee.

My question is, does anyone else feel worse after physio?. I'm fine whilst I'm there, can do all the exercises and feel quite elated when I come home. It's the following day when I feel as if I've gone back three weeks with my progress, feel weak all over and get very weepy. I've no idea what's going on.

There aren't any red patches and no pain so I'm sure there's no infection, it's just red hot all over and I've spent most of the day with ice on it and with it up (not had ice on all the time, probably every hour for 10 mins or so).  But within 5 minutes of ice coming off, I can feel it getting hot again.  There is no pain, it is just hot and maybe a bit swollen as it is feeling very stiff and tight, but I am still doing exercises to stretch and relieve this tightness.

"Hi everyone.
I had TKR 5 weeks ago after needing one for probably 6 or 7 years with bone on bone osteoarthritis.  I went through arthroscopic surgeries, injections, acupuncture - they seemed to throw everything at me to delay it ""because of your age"" (I'm 49 now).
Different health professionals have told me different things over the years - at my age I could wear it out in 10 years because I will do more on it than someone older, they will only do 3 in my lifetime which means later in life I could be in a wheelchair, have bones fused or even amputation!
I am resigned to having to have to have another one at some point in the future, but my question is - any ideas or experiences to how long a TKR will last in a younger patient?

"Afternoon everyone.
As we all know, we experience many strange things as we go through our knee journeys, and whenever we ask ""is this normal?"" there is usually a resounding chorus of ""Yes!!""
However, I think I may be experiencing something unique to me...
I keep a little notebook, and note down activities undertaken through the day, pain levels and medication taken and at what time.
Now I've never been a particularly good sleeper, and often talked in my sleep. I'm in a separate room to Hubbs while I'm getting over this surgery, so not sure if I'm still doing it. What I DO do, however, is sleep-write! Some recent gems include ""3am, plenty of leaves, cucumber etc"", ""Too close for converse"", and ""Underbelly I will do""!!! I have no memory of writing any of this!!!
So come on everyone, any more sleep-writers out there??

I'm still trying to be positive, but it's very difficult to do tonight. Don't mean to moan, it's just good to know that someone out there is going through the same.

"Hiya everyone, I have just finished my six week circuit session at the hospital gym with the physiotherapist. I am so disappointed at my progress. I have managed to do all the exercises, plus the ones at home, I have a perfect bend and no problems straightening my knee but I just cannot stand up of this sit down without holding on to something (difficult when needing the toilet) without excruciating pain on the outside of my knee. I also get the same pain when going up a hill or step and down steps too. I am 5 months post op on a partial knee replacement and I thought I would be rid of my crutch a long time ago. Really gutted. I have to go back to a one on one appointment with physiotherapist at the end of the month but then what. Has anyone had anything like this happen to them and do you know what will be the next step for me, pardon the pun.Susan x.

"my recovery 4wks 2*TKR seems to be going really well except that I am now finding it so difficult to get comfortable at night.  I am not in pain, but my legs seem to feel fatigued and I spend most of the night rolling from one side to the other, onto my back, back onto my side.  Just as I am about to drop off to sleep, or have been for a short time, I am wide awake and feel the need to roll over again.  My bed looks like a disaster zone by the morning with blanket and quilt and pillows all over the place. And I feel exhausted.  Perhaps I might try massaging the legs before bed tonight and see how that goes.  Any other suggestions would be appreciated.

"Hi guys! I'm 2 1/2 weeks post op and last night did something I don't think I should have and now paying the price!!! On my own as hubby works away and only youngest son home but he works evening shifts so in bed asleep!!! My darling little cat decides to be sick under my bed in the very early hours I couldn't just leave it so manoeuvred myself to clear it up and obviously had to put some pressure on operated knee and experienced some discomfort whist doing so! Am now really worried I've done something I shouldn't have as this morning I feel back to square one with the pain and stiffness? Does anyone else suffer the pain behind the knee running down the calf? I had half knee replaced by the way!

"Hi I havent written for couple of weeks, I'm six weeks in Tkr today. At three weeks I felt good and then four to five a pain came down the leg at side of knee and couldn't put my foot down, this lasted over a week and was very depressing, I couldn't  do my Physio as good as I should but two days ago a miracle happened and the pain had gone,  now physio yesterday I measured 100 bend but the straight part not good at seven.  I saw my consultant at the hospital this morning and he was concerned about the pain i had and did an x ray in case it was a stress fracture but thankfully it wasn't. He said it is a big operation and  it can take up to a year to get full strength,  I took my dog for fifteen minute walk today without my stick and feel fine,  now resting. If you do something remember to rest afterwards, I still take naproxen and co codamol daily.  My husband desperate to take me away but I will know one day when I feel better and I will take him up on his offer,  I hope everyone continues to mend,  jackie

a lovely sunny day decided to go shopping and then have a sit

me quite unexpectedly and I started to cry. What is happening?
I feel that only the people on here understand exactly what we

back to normal. I wish people on here lived nearby and we could
meet up because some days I feel so lonely. I don't give off this

"I had my TKR done 6 months ago. What an awful thing that was! Pain, drugs, depression, and worry followed by MUA because the knee wasn't bending, with more pain, drugs, depression and worry. Finally my knee was bending and I got off the drugs but I still had pain, and no energy or enthusiasm.
I spent so long dragging myself upstairs with one arm on the banister, and knitting 12 hours/day because I couldn't fo anything else, that I finally put my arm out. Rather than see another orthopedic surgeon, I went to a myofascial release therapist. Turns out he couldn't do much for my arm because the problem was an inflamed bursa and I did in the end get a cortisone shot for that.
But then he started work on my knee. After the first session it was bending easily 10 degrees more than it ever had and with NO pain - NO pain in the session with him or with my knee after. After my second session I just felt good! I did paperwork and the bank, and the DMV, went shopping, came home and picked spinach from the garden and made a quiche for dinner, followed by and hour or so of pulling weeds. I haven't had a productive day like that in MONTHS! And I was walking fast - people were getting in my way instead of the other way round. So I'm now sure that I can be a normal person again, even though I have to knuckle down sometime soon and get the other knee done.

"Hi,
I am contemplating knee replacement surgery at the end of July but I have a holiday booked staying in a caravan with hubbie about five weeks after.
Just wondering whether I would be able to cope with the journey of about 150 miles obviously as a passenger and having a restful week in a caravan by the sea side. There is only hubbie and I in the caravan and it has an extra bedroom which I could use but not sure whether this is a sensible idea or not, so would welcome thoughts from others who have had the operation.

At last post I was having real problems, I was sitting at 61° flexion and 30° extension at 8 weeks and waiting for some physio to help prevent an mua. It took another 4 weeks for my appointment to come through but I had been working hard at home to make improvements. I have just had my second physio and have now improved my flexion to 98° and extension down to 15°. I am still using one crutch but I have 2 more planned physios to go so I will hopefully be able to make further improvement over the next two weeks.

My sciatica is also on the same side as operated knee and I can't get comfortable when lying down either on my side or back my knee feels like it's on fire and the pain from the sciatica runs from the base of my spine down the buttock then radiates right the way down my thigh and calf! I'm at my wits end through lack of sleep! Also the operated knee keeps going horribly numb the only way I can describe it is the feeling you get when you've crossed your legs for too long when sitting and I have a lot of pain behind the knee and calf as well!

The Dr had a look at the other one, and yep, definitely severe Osteoarthritis. No shock there, it's the size of a grapefruit and hurts like a b!tch!

At least I will know what to expect, and have plenty of preparation time......it's frustrating now though as its the pain from the unoperated knee that's restricting me more than the prosthetic one....

"Hi posted I this section when twisted my knee and could not bear weight on it. Was told by doctor is was soft tissue damage so rested and iced it for a long time'. Went back as no improvement and just given pain killers again. Was not offered any other examination only go on waiting list for MRI scan which could take 6 months or more. No even out on the list and have been like this for 11 weeks. So decided to go private and paid for a MRI scan and could not put up with this any longer. Had results today which show torn cartildge which has flapped over the knee causing it to lock.The surgeon will do keyhole surgery with 6 to 8 weeks on the NHS. MRI scan and results in 2 days. Just feel doctor did not take much notice of me and just given pain killers. Feel so much better knowing what it it.

"First TKR 28th November, second last Friday morning. First went well and everyone tried to manage my expectations for the second one as no two joints are the same. After my op I was expecting during the first night for the painkillers and the morphine I had last time - but all I had was paracetomol and voltarol. Amazed at how little pain I had. Was discharged from hospital after two days after achieving my 90degree bend and doing the stairs. Could lift my leg off the bed Saturday - took me two weeks to do that on my first knee. At home , even sleeping has been ok. No meds atall during the night since discharged from hospital. Not used my sticks at all for walking, can go up stairs normally already. Is all going tooooo well. I have to be careful of being too confident and doing too much. Why do I have so little pain ? Not complaining of course just confused

However, I'm now 7 weeks post op and still experiencing a lot of knee pain when I practice my leg lifts or any movement involving lifting my leg.  The pain is I'm sure from my new knee cap!

"Hi, 
I have a torn meniscus cartilage which I'm told is degenerative.  Had problemms with that knee for years (its a bit wonky) and the pain and swelling came on gradually.
Anyway, my turn has come to see the Orthopedic Surgeon and I'm a bit nervous and I just wonder if anybody can tell me what to expect at the appointment?
Since I was referred the swelling has stayed the same but the pain and feeling as though the knee will 'give way' has got a bit better.  The other issue is my opposite knee is starting to hurt a lot as well now, so I wonder if he will look at both knees. 
Any tips or suggestions on what to expect?

"Don't know if its OK to mention these as they are not ""mainstream medicine"" but they certainly helped in my recovery and could help others? I took homeopathic tablets - arnica 30 and symphytum to help with bruising and bone healing respectively. Also a tonic called floravital which a yeast free herb-based iron and vitamin tonic, because although you may not be anaemic, your ferritin levels will probably be low after major surgery and this helps boost your natural resources. I also used arnica cream regularly on the whole leg and I found acupuncture treatment helped with the sharp nerve pain and also swelling to some extent, also took pre and pro-biotic powders for a month after the op to help restore gut health after the hefty dose of antibiotics given during the operation which knock out ""healthy"" bacteria as well as unhealthy, and had the little yoghourt drinks each day for a while. Don't know if this might help some people.

"Hi gang, had physio today (I must be odd, I really enjoy going!) And my numbers were measured...... Last time my extension was 6 and now it's 5, so only a little movement but it's going in the right direction. But my bend, which was 87 last time, is 105. 105!!!!!!!! I'm over the moon! My lovely physio would usually discharge at those numbers, but as I'm now having so much trouble with my other knee, and am really struggling to hear weight on it, she wants to wait until I've seen my consultant on Monday in case he wants me to do any specific strengthening exercises to help it.
So the hard work is starting to pay off, the sun is shining, if I could just get more than 2 hours sleep at a time then all would be well!
Hope everyone is well and making good progress.

I am now at 21 weeks. Last week I hardly slept. The swelling on my knee seems completely gone, accept when I overdo it.
With the loss so swelling my knee became clunky and it seemed to be clicking into place. The doctor thought so too. 
Pits getting better now, I am sleeping without a pillow between my knees. It gets uncomfortable, but not so often.
my bend is 147 degrees. So, I think I have really turned the last corner (fingers crossed).
Im still taking painkillers at night to get me through, and occasionally during the day.

"My husband had knee replacement last July. He has always said it just didn't ""feel right"". So in Feb. they took him to surgery twice to clean out the knee. Last Monday, they took him back and removed the knee and put a cement spacer in. He will be on IV antibiotics for 6 weeks, we go to the infection disease control clinic every day for new bags of his antibiotics. He cannot put any weight on that leg or bend it, so he is in a brace from ankle to thigh. The weird thing is that the cultures have not grown any infection. The dr is thinking now that he is possibly allergic to one or more of the components of the knee, so they are sending him to an allegy clinic for testing. It will be and has been a long hard hill to climb. We are praying that they find something so that when they do the next replacement in 8 weeks, this one will be alright.

"hi. This might sound weird but I'm 5 weeks post op and my TKR feels like a graze (when you fall over as a child) but on the inside, if that makes any sense?  I am not doing too bad although since being given new exercises (which are very painful!) this strange feeling has surfaced.  I did have my first proper outing yesterday (as haven't been out apart from hospital) so may be that's the reason. I know its early days but I feel I'm going one step forward two steps back at the moment!  There's also the dilemma every day of what meds to take.  Ibuprofen gives me upset stomach, so am taking co codamol which has the constipation effect.  I have tried taking ranitidine before the buprofen but is like a lottery whether it works or.not.  Will I ever feel normal?

"Have been to town this am to buy 2 tubes of flexiseq and am wondering if it will help the TKR knee as well as my other painful knee and hands. While I was researching this gel I found an interesting discussion on this site started by William about 11 months ago which explains very clearly how it works. Apparently it migrates through the tissues attracted to the existing fluids in your joint and re-lubricates the worn surfaces so reducing friction which causes pain - hence wondering if there is fluid in the new knee to make it work. Its too expensive to be wasting any of it!!!

"I'm at the 5.5 month mark and for the most part, everything has been pretty good. Oh yes, in the beginning I thought I must have lost my mind, having a bilateral TKR while living in India. Nothing was done like I'd been told by friends; pain meds were almost nothing, no special machine to bend my knee, no ice machine for helping with the swelling, etc. But, I'm doing well, I've got a decent bend, my knees goes very straight, I'm swimming and on an upright stationary bike, go up and down stairs. But, they're no where near the knees I anticipated. I've been told give it 6 months, 12 months and even 24 months. Okay, I get that (and you all have been so helpful at letting me know I'm not alone). I understand the crunchy sorta sound when I sit and stand is normal, and it should eventually stop (right?), but what about the crazy numbness I have? It's on both knees and runs over to the outer side and down to the calves. I find myself bumping into things or people knocking into them and the feeling is that of walking on a foot that's fallen asleep. Pins and needles. Does this indeed go away?

Before accident, i used to run, skip ropes and was in good health. But since the accident, cant run or skip ropes. Is there any device that will help me take the pressure off my knee and enable me to run or skip ropes? I tried a Germany made brace, but even that doesnt help at all. I think if we  reached moon so many years ago, then my problem shouldnt be something that cant be overcome.

I also managed to get an appointment with the Dr. this morning for more pain killers but now have to try and get another appointment tomorrow.

My bend is quite good but the straightening is not....worried about that.

"Hi. Hope you can help! I'm 12 weeks post op. And although recovery very slow and hard, I was starting to feel I was getting somewhere. How ever a few days ago whilst I was outside walking I suddenly got this agonising pain in my back ! Just below my left shoulder blade ( left knee replacement) it's like a knife In my back and it's now happening every time I'm on my feet for longer than a few minutes! Only thing that helps is a hot water bottle in my back when I'm sitting or laying down. I have severe progressive arthritis in all my joints .but stabbing back pain is new ! I'm guessing it could be my posture. I'm seeing physio later. But anyone else going through this? Going back to work on Monday so need it gone. X

"Hi guys,
Hope you're all ok.
So in 2011 I hurt my right knee snowboarding (had already hurt the left one 10 years before!)
When I came back I saw a physio who said just do exercise to build the muscle around it.
Generally it's ok, but I've been doing some decorating and been kneeling down a fair bit and it's playing up again.
The only way I can describe it is when I bend it upwards at 90 degrees it feels like it's going to snap. The pain when I press into the knee is like a sharp nerve type of pain, similar to the pain when you hit your funny bone.
And it feels a bit spongey to touch.
Has a horrible grindy crackling sound when I bend it too.
Any thoughts?  May go to the docs next week.
Thanks all
xGem
It's off centre pain to the right.

"i thought I would share info. First 2-3 weeks, barely sleep. Pains as opposed 
to aches, lost 15 lbs and my taste for food. No appetite. And exhausted.
approaching 6 weeks Tuesday and not as tired, doing constant PT in office and home.. Slowly getting appetitie back, sleep somewhat better. Pain has migrated to itching and aches. Let's not forget stiffness in AM or after idle. 
I can walk it off abit, but never really without that dull ache feeling. I have good ROM. Stretching helps. I am 71, but in great shape. Two knees is not for the faint heart or out of shape. Glad to answer any questions. The recovery is slow, but one can see it come, ""ever so slowly"". I am physically ahead, but one must let all the tissue and nerves recover..reading other exp riences is a bit of a comfort. Not alone.

"Four and a half weeks after my partial replacement and I have driven the car to the supermarket and back - whoopee!  Getting on and off the clutch was a bit grimace-inducing but I did it and for a couple of hours afterwards I definitely had more bend so it clearly gave it a bit of a workout.  Having a rest now and then I'll do a few minutes on the exercise bike.  A bit of progress is just lovely.
Hope everyone is having a good Easter weekend with plenty of medicinal chocolate and simnel cake.

"Back from hospital. The consultant has requested a second opinion with another consultant, arranged for the 23rd April. The misalignment, is 6mm, which, he says, is within the perimeter allowed for misalignment, that the body eventually (up to 18 months of hell) will adapt to the larger prosthesis, & only in exceptional circumstances of severe chronic pain, do they go in & then it would mean doing the whole thing again. That, he says, is a more serious operation than the first TKR, so it needs to be a ""last resort"". Meanwhile, my life stays on hold, I'll be addicted to pain killers by the time it gets sorted, & the soft tissue continues to be attacked by a lump of metal. How many of us knew there was a misalignment allowance? How many others struggle on? - it is so much a worse pain than the OA in the old knee.

"Evenin all!
Had another Physio session today, and my movement was measured against the figures from 2 weeks ago......
Im at 87 with my bend, which is 3 away from the holy Grail of 90, and 6 for my straight leg, which is just 1 away from the Physios' required 5.
She said she was really pleased and that I am doing really well. Im still struggling with a straight-leg lift, but Im sure that will happen in its own good time (WITH  good dose of hard work, of course!).
So despite a few really low points in the past week, I think I may be turning a small corner. 
So Happy Easter to you all, I hope you have fun whatever you do xx

Four five minute sessions on exercise bike a day and, whoopee!, sit in the car at the end the week and see how using the clutch goes and if OK try a short drive.

"Hi everyone.......as some of you recall, 2 weeks tomorrow I had to have the entire prosthesis removed due to spreading staph. This is the 4th complete opening of the knee and 10th surgery overall on the leg. Let me assure you, it doesn't get any easier. The surgery went well but required a lot of scraping of the bone due to pockets of infection
This in turn caused lots of bleeding and increased my hospital stay to a week. The morning I was scheduled to be sent to a rehab house I needed a blood transfusion. I have a hip to knee immobilizer to keep the leg straight. Friday I get the stitches pulled and hopefully they will adjust the immobilizer so I can try and get some of the bend back back. I can can now only do toe touches with no weight bearing. If all goes well, I'll get that up to 50% so I can be a bit more mobile and go home from rehab. Next step, early June, I will go back and have an entire new prosthesis inserted and then back to rehab for the grueling rebuild. Low pain levels seem to be easily maintained as you aren't doing any stretching or putting pressure on the joint put I envision it will be rather brutal tearing all of the dormant scar tissue loose when the time comes. Also I am on antibiotic infusion twice a day and will for 6-8 weeks. To all of the long time contributors to tgevforum, hope things are going well for you.

Subsequently ACL was done and a screw was fixed to rectify it and plaster of paris coiled over it and asked to wait for a month. Since puss from the area where surgery was done had been found, out of fear I was transported to bone speciality hospital where it had been diagonised the place had got infected, moreover the right knee is leant to some 15 degree. Hence I was advised for calcaneal tranction for twenty days make the leg back to position and to calm down the infection some antibiotic was given. After an arthorolysis of knee and v-y quadriceps plastry was done to give good range of movement. But after regular physio no movement has been gained and deformity persisted.
After a month later, with no hope of movement, the doctor advised for applying ilizarov fixator to correct the flextion deformity and fixed the knee. Still no movement has been evolved.
Regarding the facts, let me know the possiblility for further surgery in order to get back the knee for movement. Any knee prosthesis can do any flexion…. ?Hoping the good and best from your end..

"Hello All
I was doing well up until now, just been to the pool for my exercises. Thought i would get a bit of shopping. Was crossing the road using a stick when my knee gave way and I fell back onto my bum and hip. I think I instinctivly tried to protect my knee and it actually felt better after my fall but I am scared now that i will feel it later. My hip is sore but not enough for a break i think. This is not the first time my knee has given way. When will it be reliable??

"Really starting to feel good about this op.  8 weeks post op today and I can now walk a mile without too much pain; it's not like the ""old days"" at all!  Just the last couple days I began riding my bicycle (after warming up on stationary bike first.)   Talk about feeling positive.  Went and dropped off a book at the library and picked up a few groceries without asking anyone for help or messing with a bus.  Great.  I can walk my sister's 100lb skittish dog. 100lb puppy.  Still trouble sleeping but I wasn't that great at that before the op.  I have 125+ bend but probably still about 3-5 degrees from straight.  I think the bicylcle will help there.  I expect I will still have some bumps but this beats the heck out of the knee prior to the op.  Smiling about little things.   You all hang in there and stay positive.  I wish you the best.

"Hi all.
It's been a while since I posted on here. I used to be a regular when I 1st had my operation and so appreciated all the support the ""knee members"" on this forum gave me. I thought I would update you as it's now a full year since mine and hope I will give any newbies inspiration.
The 1st few weeks post op was the worst, the pain both physical and emotional was houredous. I never believed I would walk or even sleep again, but I did. The advice I can give is not to be too hard on yourself, it's a major operation on the biggest joint in your whole body so don't expect miracles. Listen to your physio and push yourself to achieve your goals each day, if your feeling pain during /after excercise means your doing it right, plan your medication after your excercise and ice straight after. Complete 30 min walks twice a day building them up to an hour. The fresh air and seeing the outside world is great for you mentally. Give yourself goals to build too. I was lucky as I had a few family things going on so I would set a goal to be able to....""walk without my stick for the christening "" ""be able to drive to the cottage beak"" etc etc etc. I was put under pressure by my manager to return to work but I listened to my body and thought about how my role in work would effect my knee so stayed of for 5 months with the support of my GP. I am now back full time! I still do my stretches and excercise and do walk a lot, I have just been discharged from the hospital after seeing my surgeon he explained I have a high flex prosthesis which has enabled be to get a brilliant bend, as an example I can bend my knee backwards and touch my buttocks with my heal. The Anniversary x rays showed no movement or misplaced areas in the joint. I informed my surgeon that I do hear a click when I walk, his answer was its a plastic spacer against a metal joint the depth of the spacer determines your bend so he obviously he got my spacer right. He also told me I have played a major part by doing all my excersices and building up my muscle power. The feeling I had when I was discharged was fantastic. Yes I have to continue stretching and keeping it moving but can live with that after all its my body so I will respect it. I have just returned from a hen party away with a bunch of energetic 30 year old and kept up with all the walking and dancing. . There is a light at what seems a very long tunnel so try and stay positive and you will all be fine.. I'm so very grateful to my surgeon and to a fantastic NHS who come under so much criticism , without each and everyone who supported me through the worst pain of my life I wouldn't be as positive as I am feeling now.
Best wishes to you all and stay positive and focused. X

"Hello .. This will be a long moaning, worried posting. I have not posted for a while and am feeling very low about my progress. I am six months post right TKR due to osteoarthritis and have been slowed down by ongoing recovery from a back fusion done just over a year ago ... So a back fusion followed by the knee at 7 months, a lot to take on, I have been worried about my progress ... Straightening the knee has been pretty good, degree of bend not so good. The best was 115 and now not just stalling, but regressing, I saw my surgeon who said he was happy enough with me ... X-rays were really good. He said to just keep going .. That was about three weeks ago. 
I have had sciatica on and off for a couple of months now and I am sure that is because of my knee. I have been seeing a physio who has given me ultrasound and other treatments for the back and the knee but I am still not able to increase my degree of bend very much. I can get up the stairs but coming down is still very difficult. I am trying to walk more but the sciatica prevents me going far and the knee exercises are not 'cracking' through the progress barrier, and I know I have to try harder.
Lastly .. And really what has made me write here is that last Thursday was particularly cold and I got very chilled. My husband suggested I have a bath to warm up ... The first bath rather than shower in years! Getting in was ok but getting up and out was nearly impossible despite his help, I tried to stand on the good leg but couldn't get all the way so then, with the good leg semi bent, had to bend the operated leg and put my whole body weight through it Very painful and since then I have had shin bone pain again and the outside of the knee at the back and the calf have been painful and sometimes will not bear my weight. I am trying to walk to keep moving but the first steps are awful. I am waking at night with pain again after getting better nights for a while now.
i decided to see my rheumatologist last night who said the leg is just generally inflamed and he gave me a steroid injection in my behind which will go around my whole body and help to calm everything down. He doesn't think I have done anything catastrophic to the knee, just badly strained it.  I have had these steroid injections the past and found them helpful. I have physio today so will get more ultrasound,
These setbacks and general lack of progress make me feel depressed as I cannot see being better than this with the bend and strength in my leg. I am wondering if getting some hydrotherapy to push on a bit might be the way to go? Is it too late to get the improvement I need? Should I start icing again? 
Any suggestions and encouragement greatly appreciated.  We are going to Lanzerote for a week mid-April and I am hoping that some warmer weather and moving in the pool will be a help. Thanks for reading all this ...

Could well change in the next few days, so watch this space ....

"I arrived in LA on Tuesday after a 14 hour flight, I felt a twinge in my knee on the 2nd day and by the evening I was in A fair amount of pain, I decided to go out the next day anyway and limped around. However since yesterday morning I have had little movement - been resting, iceing, compression, elevating it, ibuprofen etc. It does feel like its getting better I can now put weight on it however it still feels stiff and hurts if i try to force it to bend.
I want to get on with my holiday but obviously don't want it to return worse the next day.
Should I just continue doing what I'm doing? And when will I know that I'm ready to walk again? Will my knee bend without pain or do I need to walk a bit to solve it or stretch anything?
Any help would be really appreciated. I am stuck in a tiny room in LA and my holiday is a contender for vholidays from hell at the moment.
As a side note I seem to suffer from ankle and foot injuries when I overuse my feet. For instance I joined a gym a couple of weeks ago after two days I was laid up in bed for 2 days trying to fix them again.

"Up until the last few days I have been doing very well, then suddenly my knee started swelling more, getting tighter and a bit more pain. On Sunday I found it difficult to walk. I am wondering if it is because I am sat more at my desk now I am back at work therefore not getting enough elevation. I haven't overdone it. I am now trying to make more of an effort and at nightime elevate and ice. Maybe I have been lulled into a false sense of security, being impatient and not appreciating how long everything takes. It has been a bit easier the last two days.
Is this all normal? my husband thinks I should go to the GP but I dont want to bother them if this is the case.

"Had my ultrasound this afternoon. The radiologist ( a senior one at the Nuffield, although I am NHS) showed me why I had swellings & was still in pain after 20+ weeks. The knee is not aligned corrrectly. There is a visible ""shelf"" (his description) that is rubbing all the time on the soft tissue, which is inflamed. So no fluid (is that a relief or not?) - but all the excercising/physio/massage in the world is not going to correct this alignment. I see the consultant on the 30th March, but I have lost ALL confidence in him. His letter to my GP, when I went back to see him with the swellings & pain, said the ""alignment was satisfactory"", & at the time, I mentioned in this forum, I would rather it was perfect. There is no way I can live with the constant pain, & I dread to think what I'll have to go through for correcting it. Has anyone else had this happen?

 He said I can now do any exercise, walk any distance, swim, the gym basicaly nothing is out of bounds. 
 So today I walked 1 1/2 mile instead of 3/4 and yes it was sore and this afternoon I cut the grass as it is a nice day, again Im mega sore just like he said I would be. Iv also done a lot of sitting pushing my foot back as far as it will go to stretch the ham strings.
 I  do feel like I have a bit of my life back especially when I could drive to the local garden centre for some grass feed.

"Hi have been reading previous discussions which have been very interesting. I have rheumatoid arthritis and am registered disabled now as have only recently been diagnosed, once Drs eventually listened to me properly. I use 2x crutches and a scooter to get around. Exercise is very difficult and keeping weight off, even more difficult. 
I have been referred for knee surgery but have been given scare tactics by anaesthetist, so I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and managed to get operation done despite being overweight. Any suggestions (other than bariatric surgery as suggested by anaesthetist after telling me that I could die on the surgeons table!) greatfully received.
Good to hear so many positive recovery stories from those post op! Keep going.

We are always totally honest with each other on here, so youll uinderstand when I say this is bloody BRUTAL!!
Ive got loads to say and to tell, but Im still pretty worn out, so I think youre going to end up with a few bits and bobs until I get myself stronger and get my story together.
SO.
Brain Fog - I can barley string 2 coherent thoughts together.
Pain - Simply indescribable, so I wont bother trying. 
Appetite - I think mine has flown South for the Summer, although I am managing to eat 3 meals a day - a small piece of toast with honey counts as a meal, right??
Sense of Humour - I think its eloped with my appetite!
Dignity - Ha! What shreds I had left have now packed their bags and retired to gentler climes.
Emotions - Up and down, and up, and down again......
Im probably coming across as really negative, but Im honestly not. Ive got lots to be positive about - Im far more mobile than I expected to be, can do far more for myself and therefore be a little more independant than I expected, but even little things annoy, like wanting to be able to sit in a comfortable position for more than 30 seconds after spending 5 minutes in contortions to get there in the first place. 
Any questions please ask away, hope you are all well and comfortable.

"I'm around 10 months into the TKR journey, and although I don't live and breathe this forum, I do see many conflictions in regard to 'professionals' advice, and differences in type of therapy.
Some say, ditch the sticks as soon as possible...Other say you must use them for x number of weeks...Some people have ongoing physio, whereas others get it a couple of times a week for 6 weeks (me) and that's it.  Some even, have had hydrotherapy....The nearest I got to that was struggling to get in the bath at home after about 4 weeks.
I would have thought, that being pretty much the same operation and same procedure carried out globally for years, then the advice 'should' be pretty much the same.  But it isn't....Or so it seems to me

"Hi Just wondering whether any of you are in pain and unable to sleep like me.  Knee not generally as excruciatingly painful at night but the paracetamol taken earlier have made no impression on the pain whatsoever so I'm guessing it's the new exercise the physio suggested.  She calls it the ""lunge"" and you need a step/stair to do it on.  (I am only doing 5 reps at the moment) When I did it for the first time yesterday I really liked it and my knee felt really good afterwards but maybe i have overdone things a bit today because the gorgeous spring sunshine beckoned me into the garden so I also walked out there for some while.  Anyway whatever the reason my knee is giving me hell!!!  Hopefully it will settle down soon as I have an ice pack on it just now.  Tried to read my book but cannot concentrate so have radio on to drown out the barking of the foxes.  I  brought a mug of hot milk back to bed and am proud of myself because it's a very long bungalow and I managed to do it by only using one crutch and my MS makes that quite difficult.  I didn't have the heart to wake my beloved husband up as he is sleeping peacefully in another bedroom.  Well that's it for now.  Will try my book again as pain seems to be settling a bit.

He asked how it was going and I said, to be honest I'm not particularly happy.  I don't have anything like the degree of bend I was expecting, and it's nowhere near the bend in my 'good' knee.  Also, it's still swollen after 10 months.
At this point he informed me that if the bend is around 100 degrees (which it is), they would consider this to be a successful outcome, and it's never going to be anywhere near as flexible (in terms of bend as my good knee.  He also said (moving the goalposts again) that sometimes it can take up to 18 months for the swelling to go away!
I insisted he take a look at the swelling, whereupon he said ""that's not the knee that's swollen...It's the muscle above and to the right of the knee, and we need to find out what's causing that""...he said...""If the knee was swollen, that's not where I would expect to see the swelling""....Great....(NOT)...
So now I've got to wait another month for an ultrasound scan (appointment to be sent at some later date) and have an Xray to find out what's going on.
None of this information was given to me prior to the operation...I'm angry and put in very polite terms...'slightly miffed'...
Was anyone else aware of this 100 degrees thing?....And the elastic timescale for swelling to subside?

"Hi I have had a really bad pain in my left knee for over a month now. At first I thought it was because we moved from a flat to a house and I was running up and down stairs all day. I get a lot of exercise walking but sometimes walking up hill is really painful. The pain also wakes me during the night. My doctor has told me to use Deep Heat 4 times a day and also take a paracetamol 4 times a day too. Does anyone else suffer with arthritis in their knee or knees and what if any recommendations do they have to control the pain.

"It's been 6 years since I had my knees replaced and even though all the pain I use to have in my knees is gone I was deeply disappointed to discover I could no longer run.
I know it’s not recommended to run with the implants but it would have been nice to know in the event I had to run for one reason or another I could do so.
I was only 40 when I had the surgeries and my doctor knew how active I was so it never occurred to me to ask if there were different types of implants to choose from that would be more suitable with my life style.
If I try to run now I experience unbearable pain just below and above my knees. I am guessing it’s coming from the area of the bone they had to drill out for the implants. It feels just like it did when it was bone on bone
Has anyone else experienced this pain while trying to do some very light running.
What adds more salt to the wound is when I see amputees participating in iron man competitions with more than half of their leg made out of plastic and metal.
I wouldn’t have a problem going through the whole thing all over again if it meant I would be able to run now and then.
As it is right now I couldn't run if my life depended on it.
Thanks in advance,
Larry

Has anyone had experience of develop

It diappears into the knee when i sit down and sticks out when standing or walking. Should i get it checked out or is it one of the normal healing process stages? It's quite soft to touch. Be glad of any light to shine on this!

"I had a fairly busy day earlier with some walking and a trip to the dentist to get a permanent crown put on. I did some time on the exercise bike and some step ups as well.  It is now 3am and the leg really decided to swell up and cause some pain.  Some nights it gets pretty old.  I have it iced and elevated and took a pain killer and that  strong ache is starting to fade.  I guess I'm curious as to when people are able to start sleeping the night thru, or at least maybe 5 hours?  I seem to get about 3 max and end up taking a nap or even 2 during the day and I'm 7 weeks out. I know it will vary but would like to hear from folks and maybe just get an idea of when you were able to start getting real sleep.   Best wishes,

"I have noticed that several people refer to the benefits of using an exercise bike to get full knee movement back after the TKR.  With my MS I cannot balance on a proper static gym type cycle but in the past I have used one of the small pedal only ones that can be used whilst seated on a chair as a form of exercise when weather does not allow safe outdoor walking.  Is using the bike something the physios have recommended as I would hate to do anything at all to jeopardize my recovery because at 70 I am no spring chicken!!

"Hi 
Im new to this sight and finding it very helpful.
Im 56 and had a TKR just over 4 weeks ago after having two unsucessful arthroscopies in the past 8 months to repair a meniscus tear. I'm finding night time is worse for me, I get very little sleep due to the pain. I take one dehydracodine when I go to bed and one when I wake in pain early hours of the morning. I have been using a muscle and joint gel that was recommended to me and find it realy helps with the stiffness. I have about 65-70% bend and am still using one of my crutches for the stairs and when I'm in too much pain ( I use both crutches when I get out of bed throught the night). I am finding my other knee is now causing me pain, I had an arthroscopy on that knee 3 years ago but it looks like I now need a TKR.
I thought by 4 weeks I would have been more mobile than I am. Iv been off sick from work for 8 months, does anyone know at what point you realy start to notice a vast improvement.

"I'm posting here for my dad (age 55), he had a right TKR 2/26/15 and has been recovering at home (discharged from hospital on 3/1/15). From the physical standpoint, the physical therapist says his progress is excellent compared to what she is used to and he is able to walk with a walker with minimal pain. He is not taking any pain meds, just a blood thinner (prescribed by the hospital post-op as a preventative measure for blood clots) and his Lisinopril for high blood pressure which he has taken daily the past 3 years. I have a question however about the symptoms and what everyone here has been going through early on post op. He has changed quite a bit mentally from what I am used to. He gets very tired very quickly and gets very irritable at times. He keeps saying he just wants it over with and wants to feel normal again (mentally) but I am worried about whether this is a normal feeling? He says that it almost feels like he has ADHD where he cannot focus or concentrate and he is very forgetful which is not normal for him at all. The at home nurse and physical therapist don't seem too concerned when prompted with these symptoms and say he will feel normal again in a few weeks. Has anyone had any similar experiences? Please share your experience and advice on what you recommend to help him through this feeling. Thank you!

"Hi everyone have just discovered this amazing forum for people like me who have had a TKR recently.  It is so reassuring to read your experiences and know that other people feel the way I do some days!!  I am a 70 year old lady with MS (amongst a few other things!) and my op was on the 2/2/2015.  My stay in hospital was 9 days whilst doctors and my amazing family gently rehabilitated my body without upsetting my MS too much.  I normally walk with either a stick or 2 hiking poles so the crutches don't seem too odd to me.  I have found all your various comments to be very very helpful because it is so easy to think you should be doing what everybody else is doing at a set number of weeks post op.  Pain can be quite severe as many have said but I take only paracetamol - 8 in 24 hours only - because my MS affects my balance so I cannot afford to be ""woozy"".  Any other pain relief suggestions out there?  I agree ice packs help, particularly after the thrice daily torturous exercise routines!!!!  I had not thought of alternating with warmth so may try that tip.    I found it comforting that other people have shed a few tears too as I am not normally a self pitying cry baby but the tears have fallen easily at times that's for sure.  Thank you all and I look forward to reading more as we all progress.  Next big step will be driving again so watch this space.............

"Hello Folks
12 weeks in I saw my consultant today. Xrays were very good and he was pleased with my progress. However I am concerned about my walking. Both my physio and consultant have said that i still walk with a pegleg. I straighten my leg back when i walk. This stems from the fact that for many years pre op my knee could not support any weight when bent. I think that I dont trust my new knee. The trouble is i dont know how to retrain my brain. Or is this due to my muscles not quite ready. My knee has given way a couple of times so i cant tell. Any suggestions?

He even cleared me to ride my bicycle at whatever pace seemed reasonable (that may take another week on the stationary).  He switched me to Hydrocone, to use as needed, down from Oxycodone. All in all I feel pretty heartened and hope the rest of you get some good results.   He did mention that the pockets of fluid and the heat still radiating from around the incision are normal at this stage and to not panic, and think they are staph etc.   He reminded me there may be set-backs and to just go one day at a time.

"I have followed this forum since my TKR six weeks ago and have found it really helpful. I was terrified about the operation and especially the spinal anaesthetic. I am so pleased I was persuaded that the spinal was much better for the operation, the after pain and the recovery. I consider myself extremely lucky that I have got this far with considerably little pain, only frustration at not being able to do things, stiffness and a few sleepless nights. I have taken hardly any pain killers, but I have iced and also now bought a heat pad, which helps the stiffness in the morning. My consultant was very pleased with me and thought this forum was a very good idea. My Xray  was very good my leg was very straight. He was very keen for me to get in my car and drive. Showed me my pre-op XRay and the difference was amazing, a nice gap where there was not one before. I can walk without sticks, but use one when I go for longer walks, a confidence thing. Thank you for all the advice and I shall carry on reading to see how everyone is getting on. I am not going to push it even though I have been given a confidence boost, the danger is that I could go backwards.

"Hi All,
Its been 10 days since my last post so I wanted to see if I could compare progress with anyone out there kind enough to reply.
I am at 7 weeks post op tomorrow (TKR) and I am 47 years old. I had my 6 week follow up with the consultant and he seemed really pleased and made another follow up for 6 weeks time. I had my 5th visit with the physio on Friday and he has signed me off for a month as he is so happy with my progress. I walked approximately 5 miles on Saturday, have driven to work 3 times in the last week (140 mile round trip) (not a good idea as I had issues afterwards that I previously posted) I am visiting the gym 2 to 3 times a week, exercising, stretching, swimming and generally doing all that I should be !
So why am I still feeling a bit low ?? I can't seem to shake out of it at the moment and have been feeling paranoid about my job (Sales Director). I just have the feeling that out of sight is out of mind even though I have worked from home since the day I came out of hospital ! I went to work feeling that I had to but it set me back slightly so I am working from home this week.
I am probably being a bit soft and I can usually pick myself up when I feel sorry for myself and in fact just typing this makes me feel better.
Has anyone else felt low following the Op or insecure about their job? I am putting it down to age and frustration that I can't yet keep as fit as I would like to be and that I am used to being out and about with work and not isolated and out of the way.
Any thoughts are appreciated.

"As I've found it really helpful reading this forum I thought I would just give a little rundown so far of my experience of a PFKR as they seem to be done less frequently than the TKR.  I'm 49 and have had problems with both knees but particularly the left since my teens.  I had bi-lateral arthroscopy 12 years ago but was having increasing problems with pain and mobility and the surgeon thought my tibia looked OK so this was the way to go so that when it has to be replaced I should still have good bone to work with. Went in last Thursday at 7.30, to theatre at 9 and the lovely anaesthetist had advised a general plus shorter spinal block.  I don't even recall the needle going in. Out of recovery at 12 and came home today, Monday at 10. Oral morphine helped with pain when block wore off and am now on paracetamol and codeine.  Had 2 good nights sleep in hospital only waking for the loo. Got over 90 degree bend pushing foot back under chair and good extension and flexion on the bed.  Home with one crutch and feeling tired but confident.  A good experience so far - but it's very early days of course. So grateful to have been able to read of other people's experiences.

I am 57 and have severe chronic arthritis in all my joints I have wires in my fingers and had basal thumb surgery amongst others.

I am icing. Using heat and taking pain relief. But everything hurts. Can I ask please if any of you kind people had to cope with this as well? consultant thinks I should have the other knee done as soon as I'm recovered and I'm not sure it's worth it when all my joints are screaming at me!

"My husband had a total knee replacement july, 2014. Pain never was gone completely. Jan. 2015, knee became very swollen and very very painful. After a few weeks, dr. ordered bone scan and ctscan. But before we got results, knee swelled up so large my husband couldn't walk. Went to ER. Surgeon went back into the knee. All the tissue was ""soggy"" he said. He cleaned it up, put drains in. Then 4 days later, drains were filling up fast, so he went back in removed drains. Put in an anticoagulant acid and cut away more soggy tissue. Now 2 weeks later, knee is still very swollen, and he is barely able to walk on it. Surgeon said with the hematomas he thinks he still has bleeding into the tissues. Saw a hematologist today, had tests, but will be a week before we get results. Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be causing this? He was given Xarelto after surgery, and I think that could have been a cause of this problem. Dr. said it appears it never stopped bleeding after the replacement.

"Hi all, am new to this. I am 50 and had TKR 4 weeks ago after suffering for 25 years following sports injury and subsequent knee reconstruction. Have done really well since op, d/c from physio at 2 weeks with 1 stick and a programme of exercises which I have religiously followed at home. On Sunday, slipped down 4 steps at home and bent knee completely underneath my butt (which had not happened for 25 years). Excruciating pain and hubbie had to call ambulance. I was terrified I'd damaged TKR but x-ray showed I'd been incredibly lucky and joint intact and soft tissue damage. A&E doc said rest for 1 week then restart exercising. I've been re-referred to physio but don't know if I should see them this or next week as although pain and stiffness worse since accident, I don't want to fall behind. Any advice? I feel I've lost confidence. Thank you.

So, I'm on the last leg (ha ha!) before my op on March 6th, and had my pre op today. So long as my MRSA swabs come back negative, it's all systems go. Must say I was a bit taken aback, when I was chatting to the nurse practitioner doing all my tests, and told her I'd already been to the Enhanced Recovery class - apparently my particular surgeon doesn't participate in the programme! So I'm to forget a lot of what I was told by the team last week, and expect a couple of extra days in hospital..at the end of the day, though, it's all about the final result, not the journey there. I'm happy to report no recent meltdowns, and Hubby was looking at online pictures and videos
of my forthcoming surgery today, asked me if I know what it looks like lol! Up till today he's refused to look at it at all, so it's definite progress!

"Hello  I have already posted on the general arthritis forum.  Only found this one by chance.  Quick story I am 67 female and have had knee OA for well over 20 years.

He also said 1 in 10 surgeries don't work and they are not as successful as hips and you can sitll get some pain in the long term.  I wondered what everyone thinks about this.  How did you decide when to go ahead with surgery.  I also wonder whether he thought that I would not cope with the surgery because of my other arthritic problems.  I also have a few other health problems and am on various medication.  I
 can't tolerate most painkillers just paracetamol.  On the other forum members have suggested femopam and gaberpentin. (hope I've spelt them right).
I am going to ask my gp. My other question is about referred and radiating pain.  As I understand it oa in knee causes knee pain.  Yes I do have alot of knee pain, but what gets me down is pain outer side of leg a few inches each side of the left knee, low back pain and pain down below knee to ankle.  As said I can ony take paracetamol and also pernaton cream to rub on.  I have trouble working out what is causing what pain.  Anyone else have this problem.  I am overweight and have lost 1 stone but still a couple to go.  I find that often the pain starts when lying in bed if on my left side seems beter on the right.  Thanks for reading this.

"Hi there. I am 7 weeks post op and feeling frustrated. I did very well the first month, made some progress with the flexion and extension, incision healed well, etc. Pre Op I was only 80 degrees flex and 30 degrees extend and I am now at 110 and 14 (10 on a good day). I have been working from home for weeks. Just got rid of using one crutch and now using a cane. I just seem to limp way too much without it. Physio says I need to work on my quads and hip muscles, so I am. My job requires a lot of airline travel, airports, customer visits etc. I thought by now I would be independent and ready to do that but the thought of a trip alone, snow, ice and long days on the road concern me. I am riding the bike 8km at a time and that is fine. It is the walking around that is not 100% stable. Is this normal? Am I being unrealistic?

"Hi all, I am 17 weeks out from my TKR and I am wondering how many people out there still have inflammation after this long. My knee is hot at the bottom of the knee cap all the time. Even after sleeping I have felt it and it is hot.  I have a great bend of 130 but if I walk more than 3 blocks my muscles on the top of my knee and shin bone starts hurting. Just want to know if anyone else has this after 17 weeks. Thanks.

"Hi All - I am about 14 weeks post op now and walking better than before the operation, so it was a success.  I still get stiff and sore, hot from time to time, some swelling depending upon what I've been doing, and it constantly feels really heavy.  Live in a tri-level home so many steps up and down keeps me moving in that direction.  Walking about 1.5 miles daily and peddling the stationary bike.  But --- my question.  When sitting with knee bent normally I have a flat surface on the top of my knee/leg.  My other knee is rounded, but the surgical knee is flat.  Not sure it hurts anything, it's just weird.  Anyone else experience this?

"I'll start with a history:
At 13 (2000) I was goofing around before practice for Basketball and a friend hit me in the front of the left knee with a 50lb back pack. My leg snapped back and I face planted. Shortly after, being a sports kid, I got back up and hobbled my butt down to the gym. There I explained to my coach I was in pain and they encouraged me to run through it. I did but not without trouble. At the end of practice I informed my parents, they didn't take it seriously, every day after I complained about the pain and got no response. I was encouraged to continue pushing through it, so I did. 
Three months later I broke my ankle on my right leg during a game that injury healed fine but the added pressure to the left knee did not improve the condition. Finally a year later I was taken into the surgeons, after some awfully painful pre-tests he agreed to go in and do arthroscopy even though the MRI showed nothing. When he went in he found that my miniscus was partially peeled off and that I had dime size dents in my bone. 
The arthroscopy went as well as could be expected I kept up my mobility and was non-weight bearing for 2 weeks, however at that point I was pushed by my mother to remove the crutches against the doctors 1 month oders and start walking, so I did. The leg managed to heal up enough to gift me 4 years of playing softball during highschool. 
During my senior year the knee again gave out. At this point I stopped doing sports but continued a strong excercise regimen including running, stretching, and a generally active lifestyle. 
About 3 years ago after running my knee became swollen and remarkably painful, so I empoyed the usual rigamarole of Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation, however after a week with no relief I went to my doctor. They suggested that I see a new surgeon. I followed through and saw the first surgeon who got MRI's and X-rays of the joint. He then informed me that nothing was wrong with my leg it was all in my head. Knowing that wasn't true I found a new surgeon, he said the same thing. I pushed and went to a third surgeon he came in five minutes after seeing my MRI and said ""Well you obviously have that defect that you already knew about..."" Turns out all three doctors had used the same MRI and only one located the bone spur in my knee. 
The doctor then followed up with physical therapy, Euflexxa shots, Cortizone Shots, and weight loss as due to the now year and a half of constant pain I had gained about 35 lbs. By this point I was getting sick 1-4 times a day due to pain. I passed out several times at work because I couldnt keep enough nutrition in my system. I was going home at night and laying on my couch in the dark, skipping functions I enjoy generally the pain was winning to no end. None of these helped in the least so he finally went in and did arthroscopy. He found that I had a chunk of my cartilage floating around, another piece missing, and the bone spur, he did what he could to fix it, that was September 3, 2013. 
I followed through with Physical therapy, supplements, joint and healing enhancing diets, alas in September of 2014 I had to concede that the surgery was not a success.
I went back to surgeon #3 to discuss further options and was informed that he had no further options but would get me a MRI, Brace, and a new doctor who specialize in cartilage issues for younger patients. When I went to see that doctor his assistant informed me that I had Hoffa's syndrom and even showed it to me. When the surgeon came in he told me nothing was wrong with my leg and that I needed to ""rethink"" how I felt about my injured leg and represcribed physical therapy and that I was to take zero pain relievers. 
I did as he told me to knowing that the psychological aspect can make a huge difference, however after 12 weeks I had not had one withdrawal from pain medicine, my very expensive physical therapy had gotten me no where but helping me lose 25lbs to throwing up several times daily, and put onto anxiety medications as the pain was spurring on rolling anxiety attacks.
At the end of the twelve weeks I decided I was done with doctors for the time being so I tried a holistic home approach. I began taking Tumeric, Ginger, Strawberries, Peppermin, Glucosamine & Chondroitin, and Green Tea every day and supplementing it with a healthy dose of St. John's Wort. The swelling improved very slightly but not enough to lower the pain, I managed to rebuild a decent amount of muscle but not without a cost to the rest of my body and mental sanity.
Last week my primary doctor requested I see one more surgeon, begrudgingly I have agreed to try again. I know and have accepted I may never get to play sports again or go to a show and be able to hang out standing with my friends all night without at the least paying for it the next day, but I can't find a way to even manage the pain and I am getting to my wits end about it. I'm a fighter so I definitely won't stop trying, but I don't know how to go about accepting and managing chronic knee pain to get back living my life. I spent the last two nights up way too late getting sick or having so much pain I couldn't relax to sleep, which I know starts a cycle that makes pain worse. In the last few years I have been on meds for my stomach, the pain, sleep, anxiety, and also gone through stints as long as 4 months with none hoping my body would fix itself if I gave it the chance.

They did tell me there is a small breakthrough at 6 weeks didn't think I would see it as had rough day Saturday and expect to get more of them before the end of this ride...but it's going in the right direction...yipee

"Up until September 2014 I was a regular jogger (3-4 times per week), before I began to experience an ache on the inside of my left knee, 15-20 minutes into a run. After a few weeks of 'testing' the knee on less frequent and softer runs, the pain got worse, to the point where i felt the same pain when walking or at rest. Four months on and I have entirely cut-out running from my day to day activities, and keep any walks to a slow pace, as any moderate exercise brings back symptoms. 
I would describe the pain as a dull ache, which feels as if the knee is not fully supported/stable. When walking I can feel that my form is affected by the instability of the knee. When at rest, extending the effected leg out infront relieves the feeling of instability. After exercise the knee tends to 'lock' ever-so-slightly (this is not a painful sensation), to which a kicking motion 'unlocks' the knee. If I was to locate the pain on a diagram of the knee, it falls around the medial miniscus region.  
When comparing the two knees, there is no visual clue as to what is wrong with the knee, which is why a number of doctors have told me that my knee is fine. To touch, the left knee feels slightly more 'boney' along the inside than the right one. I have tried a number of knee exercises (squats, extensions, thigh contractions) and hip strenghening exercises, as commonly prescribed for runner's knee injuries, but none of these have helped in the rehabilitation. 
Its been four months now, and although I know this is a first world problem and I am still lucky to have my limbs, it is having a negative impact on my livlihood!
Has anyone experienced anything similar? I'd really appreciate your comments/advice!

"Here's some encouragement to you early post op people.
12 weeks today, age 72, arthritis to some degree in most joints.
This week has been the first time that I have definitely felt it was all worth while!
Yes my leg aches and feels stiff after a longish walk, and yes I still seem to find it necessary to sleep with a pillow between my legs.
But, no pain killers, no knee pain, can nearly bend it as far as the other knee, can walk around town without constantly wishing I could sit down. And they say it goes on improving up to a year!
I can honestly say that if the other knee ever gets as bad as this one was I will certainly have the op.
So, light at the end of the tunnel for all you new people...hang in.

Bit difficult with the surgeon because I will continue to see him on his lecturing days, but, that will be a different chapter, and I feel I should say thankyou for his brilliant work and close the patient chapter.

"Hi All,
5 weeks and 2 days after my TKR(left knee) I drove my automatic car 70 miles to the office 1st day back !!
It was good to see everyone as I had been working from home since coming home from the OP.
The journey from the North West to the Midlands can take over 2 hours but I did it in 1 hour 50 mins and all seemed ok. I kept my knee moving as best I could whilst driving. At the office I sat at my desk and as we are on the 1st floor I made sure that I went into our factory regularly. I also had a go in our gym that we luckily have. Bike & crosstrainer. I did just enough to keep moving and not enough to sweat in my shiirt and tie.(I am a sales Director).
This was the first time in 5 weeks that I had not elevated my knee or iced at some point.
Anyway I am writing to say that everyone who advised me on the forum that it was too soon. You were RIGHT !!!
When I got home after 2 hours my knee was stiff and swollen. An hour later it felt like a lead weight and I regretted running before I could walk.
This morning the swelling has reduced and I feel better as I am working from home. Sadly I have to travel again Monday as we have our largest customer visiting. My advice to anyone one is to leave it as long as your job allows ! Its not clever to do what I have done but I was going stir crazy at home. I hope that Monday does not set me back again !!

"Last Oct my very large german shepherd knocked me off my feet injuring my knee, a trip to A&E diagnosed soft tissue damge, recommeded RICE and self referral to NHS Physio if no improvement after 7 days, so did this and waited a further 3 weeks for appt, so Mid Nov went along and physio couldnt be carried out as still extremelypainful and swollen, physio referred me to Orthopaedics which I attended on Christmas eve, she referred me back to physio for acupuncture and an MRI (which I'm having March 8th) the report came from Ortho that there were positive results for McMurrays, Clarkes and patella compresion tests, this means nothing to me, the acupuncture hasn't helped and even on my fourth visit my knee was so swollen that he couldnt get the needles in one part so its been reommended I don't carry on. So I'm now 4 months down the line and no where near getting any better, walking up and especially downstairs is very painful, driving hurts as its my left knee and the bending and straightening for the clutch aggravates it as does getting up from a seated position. I'm only 45 and feel like an old crock, my GP won't prescribe me anything stronger than 15/500 co codamol, does anyone know what the terminology used in the report actually means so I have some idea what i'm up against.

I had found that I was initiating the limp that I have used for years and I could plainly see this while watching the shadow. Trying to get the two legs to match during the walk was something my PT wanted me to do, and this seems to be a useful tool along with just looking down.  Hope that helps someboday somewhere.

"This morning I saw my surgeon, and apart from saying that the bend is still not enough, he seemed very pleased with my progress, said i can now walk without any crutch or stick, and only to go back to him now if I have any questions, or unexpected changes.  he said two kilometres a day was too much, and to drop to one kilometre, and not necessarily every day . . He specifically warned me that in women the  largest cause of infection in the joint is urinary infections, and as i suffer from these quite regularly, I shall stock up on strong antibiotics and take them as soon as I feel a twinge!  It makes me wonder why in the hospital after the operation I had to wait three days to see a urologist when i complained daily of cistitis! I know I'm going to have to be strict with myself now to keep up the exercises, as I've been working hard towards this consultation as when I saw him at ten days he was very negative about how I was doing, and said I was going to end up with MUA.  Have to say that at that point I was a total wreck and could quite happily have crawled into bed and stayed there the rest of my life!  It does get better eventually, doesn't it!  (and then it gets worse again . . but onward and upward!!!)

"Hi all, as the title says, 17 days to go until my Right TKR.....
Today I attended a ""class"" as I have been enrolled on an Enhanced Recovery Programme......I think thats NHS speak for ""get your butt out of bed asap!"". I got to meet with one of the Physios, a senior Nurse from the ward I will be on post-op, and a lovely lady from Occupational Health. Its nice to know there will be a couple of familiar faces when I get back up on to the ward. Occ Health reckon my sofa and armchair are way too low, and the design means they cant be raised, so they are going to bring me a high, straigh-backed chair to use, and also one of the toilet-frame thingies....Im (only) 48, but feel I should have a pair of half-moon glasses on a chain, and a disapproving frown if Im to sit in one of those high back chairs....shoulders back and spine straight, girls.....I also found out that they will be fitting Cryo Cuffs after Surgery, and that I get to keep them to use at home - but not the ice bucket that fits on as theyre too expensive, apparantly. I've heard really good things about the Cuffs, and looked into buying one myself - Im glad I didnt bother!
Ive got my pre-op next Monday, when Ill be meeting with my Surgeon and Anaesthetist,, then it'll be a straight run up to March  6th....I actually felt really lucky today, as no-one else in my class has their surgery date yet.....I also noticed that a lot of people didnt seem to know much about the surgery itself, and what to expect during recovery - i cant imagine no having all the knowledge Ive gained from the Internet, and from you lovely guys on here, 
So, thats me all up to date, hope you are all well and (relatively) pain free, and that you all have the same beautiful sunny skies as I do today xx

"I'm 11 wks plus 3 days post op. I was concerned because I couldn't get the bend much past 92-95. I saw my surgeon today. His response was he thinks I'm doing fine. He asked if I was able to do the things I want to do? Then he said, I could put you under anesthesic and force it, but I don't like doing it because there's a risk of fracturing the femur or tearing the ligaments. And stating the bend before, I wiont get much more than 110. So for all of that and my age, 63, I figure I won't be needing to be on my knees scrubbing floors so I decided to take the cards I'm dealt. I go back to work on Monday. And I'm on the list for the next TKR anytime from 6 months to a year.

On another note, I was looking for exercises for this particular problem on a page about the TKR.  It explained how on the second day you would get up, and probably walk on the third day.

"Hi all
I have had a real slow recovery - but getting there. However, my knee is still incomfortable, & I have 3 swelling areas, on the sensitive side of my replaced knee. I had to see my GP yesterday for another matter, & he asked to see the knee - he said I had to make an appointment for 4 weeks time, & if the fluid swellings were still there, he'd like me to go back & see the consultant. Does anyone ele have this problem? Do they do anything about it?

"I am 4 weeks out from TKR and was able to walk a relatively pain free (and slow) mile.  That really felt like a giant step after the pain and immobility of these past weeks.  I can feel I have a long way to go but this is a start.  I iced immediately when I got home and know that I will pay a little for this later but we have weather coming in tonight and I thought I would give it a shot.  I am 57 and due to epilepsy don't drive and rely heavily on busing, walking and biking around.  I was also doing yoga prior to all this so I was pretty flexible.  It is exciting.  My PT said to work on strength and balance and especially the stationary bike for a few weeks prior to trying to ride the bike.  I'm going to just day by day it and see how it goes.  Any recommendations/advice  would be appreciated.

"Hi
I'm 15 weeks post TKR and i have so much pain today is like going back weeks!
My actual knee is not swollen but very sore but also the shin, calf and thigh above the front of the knee hurt like crazy. I have a big swelling on the back of the knee. (Not a baker's cyst) and an even bigger swelling at the bottom of my hamstrings.
It's like terrible toothache pain in my leg. I've taken paracetamol and ibuprofen together and massaged with voltaren.

"Hi
now @ 15wks TKR and doing much better.
Returned to work this week (desk job)
getting off the bus early and walking 1.5km to work. Using pedal cycle in the office. Walking about as much as my job allows - but..
I now find that my muscles in that leg are very tight and sore - especially the hamstrings - and my lower leg is pretty skinny compared to the other one.
I am presuming its the sudden extra effort causing the soreness but did everyone have this loss of muscle and soreness?
Will it build up again? Seeing surgeon on 20th March so a while to go yet to ask him
thanks

"Morning people. Can I please ask your views on support tights and if any of you have used them ? I am now 4 weeks and 3rd as post op. And I'm still in a considerable amount of pain. The worse is in my kneecap. That kills! I have ramped up my exercises a bit and generally trying to move a bit more. But then off course it swells and restricts movement. I am icing often. I wasn't given any ted support socks when I left hospital .but I'm wondering now if when I'm walking around with my stick if support tights would help to support the knee and the muscles around it. My only fear is that it may irritate my very long scar. Any thoughts very welcome. Thank you x

"Hi All,
This is my first post and I would be interested to hear any thoughts that fellow TKR patients have.
I am 47 in 2 weeks and have suffered for about 10 years with joint trouble. I had various scrapes and drills and arthroscopies etc on both knees over the 10 years of increasing pain. Eventually joint pain became like a form of tourettes syndrome for me and I would shout out in pain in the middle of a supermarket startling shoppers as bone met bare bone.
I eventually had a Uni compartmental replacement 6 years ago on my right knee and I slowly recovered quite well but regret not rehabilitating properly as I had just started a new job. My left knee had worn badly and following 2 minor ops the consultant suggested a TKR late last year. I was very reluctant at first as I'm 46 years old and very young for the full op. He told me however that he had done 10 ops in 12 months on people of my age which did reasure me.
4 weeks post op and I think that I am doing OK. Day 2 was horrendous as the physio warned me it would be the worst day. I could not even lift my leg off the bed and I wondered what I had let myself in for. I can say that the following day was much better and each day following it has improved. Today 4 weeks on I have walked better than ever (with just the slightest hint of a limp not used crutches for 2 weeks). I keep up with painkillers every 6 hours or so and also exercise and stretch as I should. If I do too much my body lets me know and I struggle the next day.
One real issue for me are the compression stockings ! I hate them and they leave deep ring around my leg just below the knee. Surely that can't be right ? I have left them off this morning and I wondered if that would cause me problems ? I am wearing them 24/7 otherwise.
I work in the Midlands 70 miles from my home in the North West and I travel there and back 4 days a week. I am itching to give it a go as I drive an automatic but I think it may be too soon as I can spend up to 3 hours at times in trafffic. Does anyone have a similar commute ?
Sorry for the chapter and verse !
Mike

"Hi just me again! Have no one else to turn to! I'm now 5 weeks and feel like I've gone backwards! I've stepped up my exercises and am walking in my flat with one stick. But I'm in so much pain I just feel like I'm not coping. I really thought it would get a little easier. The muscles in my leg are extremely weak so a lot of work needed there. But the pain in the middle of my knee is extreme. And it's like it whatever I'm doing .sitting/ standing etc etc. It's so bad I'm not wanting to do anything. Also down the inside of my knee. I'm so frightened that it's not going to be okay. That I'm becoming very depressed. My gp seems to think that I should only need pain control when I go to physio. And anything else I take my tummy doesn't tolerate. I'm due for my 2nd visit to physio tomorrow .anyone else had this happen and got through it? X

"I had my knee mobilized under anesthesia yesterday. They did a femoral nerve block and then gave me a dose of Michael Jackson's favorite sleeping aid - he did get the good drugs! As soon as I woke up I was off to physical therapy. Bit of a shock regressing back to a deadened quad muscle and a leg that felt like rubber, but gosh, got that bend to 124. Then today I went again (have to go 10 consecutive days) and got it to 127. I'm not saying it's not painful, but it's a different kind of pain. This pain feels more like a bad bruise and I can cope with it I think even after the nerve block wears off. I'm just a little nervous that it's all too good to be true! I'll be 12 weeks tomorrow, and I am still on my pain meds, but now it doesn't seem like taking drugs with no results to show for it.

"i know someone who had a TKR 10 weeks ago. At six week she went in to have a full manipulation done under anaesthetic due to low range movement with 24 hours on a a CPM. This was due to scar tissue adhesions reducing movement. 
Now ow she is getting 85-90 degree bend over edge of physio bench but can only side leg up when lying down to about 45-50 degrees. 
Consultant wants more physio and says adhesions may reform with addn manipulation needed. 
Stil il in pain when exercising at home and not very happy with progress. Can walk without stick. 
Has  anyone else had more than one set of manipulations and can anyone give advice as to whether this is normal or should we be concerned. 
She had previously had two keyhole arthroscopies btw

"I'm 43 yrs old and live in the USA and this is the only good forum sight I could find. So 8 weeks out and I still can't bend my knee when walking because of the pain. It hurts from my knee cap to my foot. I can't stand without pain, just like before my surgery. I can get to 130 degrees and 0 going straight but my scar always feels like it's going to rip open. Still have trouble sleeping, stairs I can't do normal but I can ride the bike for 15 min. I can't walk too long either. I must confess I don't do my exercises at home, only when at therapy. I used the walker for a week and never used crutches. I drove after 4 weeks. It's like I'm ahead in some things but behind in others. My pain is constant and im off all meds. My knee feels worse than before surgery and it's frustrating. I'm off ice and use heat, ice seems to make it worse.i hope I did make a huge mistake having the surgery.

when they hammer up the femur with the prosthetic, it's quite a lot of trauma and that is apparently what has caused this problem.
also my foot turns out when before it didn't, this is aggravated my hip too. Now I am getting swelling and pain on the outside of my knee!

"I am thinking one of my main problems is my knee is stuck in ""flexion contracture."" It is a little worse with weight bearing- or certainly feels that way. I think all my 7 ""professionals"" I saw missed this. I kept looking at weaknesses and flexibilities myself but I think if I can get the knee to straighten out I can make things better a lot quicker.
I do not know the exact angle I am at (doctor appt. next week will hopefully help with this), but I can only get the back of the knee to about 1.5 inches from the wall at best (heel and glutes against wall, then try to entend back). I am a little better after stretching, but it is mostly temporary.
I do feel better at times when I get a little more stretch out of the joint. 
Sometimes it feels tight in the back of the knee/hamstrings, and sometimes after I get some stretch it then feels tight around the front of the knee/patella area. My other leg can snap back with ease, and that supposedly is the worse knee (MRI is clear on the problem bent knee right now).
Any advice how to beat this? Knee issue has gone on for 13 months and the contracture I suspect for quite a while too now, which is concerning. I feel it is mostly muscular but what should I do? Are there any tests to see if it is also joint related? Any modalities I can try. Right now I am stretching, and heating while elevating my heel. I understand now that working out will not help much, only with symptoms, which is what I am experiencing. Muscles are not activating properly when I walk.
Thank you! (I just want to walk normal without pain again...)

My whole knee area has not yet begun to return to a normal looking knee.
Been to my Othopaepdist frequently throughout the year. Have tried using a ""tens unit"", icing knee area,cortisone shots, topical Pennsaid gel,topical Voltaren, Celebrex,and plain old aspirin.
Dr suggested taking BoswelliaAKBA supplement 500mg(recent study using this for pain and inflammation...study found it worked better than cortisone shots or any NSAID.

I'm 3 week + 1 and I'm feeling really down heartened. My bend is 70ish, but that's only when sat on the end of dining table and letting gravity play its part. No way can I get that sat normally on a bed or chair. Still using a stick although gone from 2 to 1. I'm only getting Physio once a week and then it's a group session and no one to one really and now I don't feel like I'm progressing very quickly. 
Pain is controllable to a point now, sleep isn't easily come by still. My swelling is still so bad and I ice often and all over my knee not just the top. It's the swelling I feel that's stopping my bend, it's like pushing against a brick wall with nowhere to go! I still can't do a straight leg raise or lift my leg indepandantly. I feel so behind everyone else.  
I'm 34 and trying to keep my house, kids, husband and dogs running is frustrating when i can't get about very well.

"I'll try to be short but this is my first post here. It start with laying floor tile.
My knee/muscles got tight and kneecap cracked a few times getting up. I also hit under the patella with a piece of tile- it hurt like crazy for a minute but went away. There was too much getting up and down and having to reset some tile, straining the knee. I had pain ever since then. 1.5 weeks later my knee starting cracking and swelled around the patella. The cracking stopped completely last July after some hard glute work going up and down ladders after my worker did not show up. 
Here are my current symptoms""
Medial knee pain- medial under petalla- still various degree of swelling
between 12 and 9 o'clock looking down- no redness or warmth ever.
Pes Anserine Pain on occasion, or jointline pain but no pain on palpation- perhaps on the medial condyle at the joint line.
More recent medial sided pain- hamstring related?
I cannot entend my leg fully when weight bearing.
I have a little weakness still in quads.
Pain normally sharp, esp after getting out of longer car ride
I limp most of the time, and cannot run
I feel pain 90% of the day
My femur feels like it is slightly rotated inward, or my foot is slightly outward- this can't help but most people I see walk with their right foot turned out more than me!
I tried everything inc. 2 orthos, 3 PT's, chiro, massage.
MRI and X-Ray was shockingly ""normal"" 
I actually had 3 instances in the last 10 days at night where the knee suddenly felt fine- muscles firing. This happened after 9 p.m or so. Then the left knee went haywire! Patella mostly and some similar pains that I have in the right knee. The first time was the worst and the last was isolated to one area. This stunned me. I am busting my butt in the gym but the work does not seem to match the ""progress."" 
I can answer any questions including previous symptoms. Thank you!!!
Oh, I am fine on stairways, and going down is easier now with my quad work. It is walking that mainly kills me! Squatting is the gym is o.k.- sometimes kneecap pain from pressure but weaker quad likely culprit. I do not have full flexion either, but the quad seems to get in the way of that now.

Yesterday whilst coming downstairs one stair at a time (can't manage the normal way at all) from my top floor, where the kitchen is (the little loiunge with the woodburner is 3 floors below) my leg gave way. The jolt of pain was dreadful - worse still - the carefully prepared sandwiches flew into the air! After that - the knee began to swell, so I'm back on ice & being careful once again. This is the 1st time the leg has actually given way, but that pain is something else. Does anyone else have this problem? I swear I'm going backwards.

"Hi. I just really want to give a Huge thanks to everyone who has messaged me or posted on this site. As I've said before I am a 57 year old twice widowed lady. Who suffers from depression anyway. I have severe arithrits in all my joints and I'm no stranger to surgery. But this op.was the most painful thing I have ever had done! My surgeon told me he had to make a bigger incision that usual just due to the state my knee was in. Hence I have a wound that runs up over my knee and approx 8 inches above. My son said it looks like I belong hanging in a butchers shop ha ha. But joking aside. This as a lot of you already know is hard work and extremely frustrating and painful. I have in the first 2 weeks felt so depressed. Isolated (I live alone) and at times frightened.you can't even escape in sleep because you can't get comfortable. In those lonely times when I didn't know if what I was feeling was normal. I kept up to date with all your posts and I can't tell you how much this has helped me both physically and mentally. I'm now just over 3 weeks .And I know it's still early days for this op.but I'm noticing little improvements. Now I feel I will get there. The pain I still have is normal and I'm copying with it much better. And it's all down to you. So sorry this is a bit of a novel.but thanks everyone and good luck to all of us. I will of course still be on here following everyone's journey as well as posting my own when required. Xx

"Think we all need some cheering up. It's tough and slow progress post TKR. But that are humorous moments.
for example yesterday I walked along our High Street with crutches. Had an annoying itch on my nose. I gave it a quick scratch forgetting I had crutch attached and manage to get a man walking next to me full square in the stomach with the crutch. He was fine but he said someone had done the exact same thing to him yesterday. ""Knee replacement?"" he sighed. 
""Yes"" I replied.

I am now 13wks post TKR. I have about 130+ bend and more or less full straighten. Walking is still uncomfortable from tightness.
The main problem is that now when bending i get a lot of discomfort behind the knee in the hamstrings area. If i press the area - i can bend more - otherwise the bend is restricted. Anyone else have this?

"Hoping I could get a bit of help on here. I seemed to have injured my left knee, it is on the inside, it's sore to touch with no bruising, walking in a straight line is fine but when I try to twist, turn, squat, lock my leg or general knee movement I get a severe pain in there, not sure what it could be? Had this pain for 2 weeks and no sign of ending.
My right knee I have had a long standing issue with. I always have a pain at front of my knee it feels like it's under my kneecap, Iv had this on off now for 9 months and was diagnosed with anterior knee pain, but I'm not even sure what that is, or how it can be cured? All I was told was to strengthen my muscles but it's hard to do that when I'm already in pain. Any ideas or what else it could be?

Hubs had to see his GP yesterday for a Blood Pressure review, and has had to have his medication increased: he asked her if worry about my forthcoming op could be responsible for the rise (err, duh!) 
obviously she said yes, but she also asked if he'd got help for when I come out of hospital - I think thats helped in 2 ways - 1) At least I know that if things get REALLY bad, I can ask for outside help, and 2) I think its made him realise this is A REALLY BIG THING if the NHS is offering help! 
I also saw my GP for a pain management review yesterday, and I've had to stop taking Tramadol, as the side effects I was having are an allergic reaction....I hope that doesnt mean that I wont be able to tolerate Morphine should I need it immediately post-op....
So all in all, Im feeling organised, calm and collected, and thats the frame of mind I need to keep for the next 4 weeks and then beyond into recovery.I'm concentrating on my pre-op exercises, and eating healthily to give myself the best chance possible. If I cound just nail the sleep, then everything would be sorted....
Onward and upward, hope everyone has a lovely weekend xx

"Hi im calling on you great people for your advise regarding the excessive pain that is driving me mad!! I'm almost 3 weeks post op now and although very tough I had noticed an improvement over the last few days. But yesterday it went down hill as my wound is very long and stretches 6/8 inches above my knee. The muscle above my knee was extremely weak and the physio told me to concentrate on the exercises to make it stronger. But the top of the wound down to my knee is swollen and very painful and has halted me doing any exercises and very painful just to stand up. I can't think of anything I have done to injure my left except maybe move a little awardiy in the night. But it is definitely raised and feels solid and extremely tender. Could this be a bursitis? And if so will it go away with rest. Doing exercise makes it worse. The area almost wants to break out the skin. Please if anyone else have or having this problem please tell me what's the best way to deal with this. Thanks everyone.

"Hello all. I found out last week that my right TKR is to be done on March 6th, so not long to wait. Im trying to  keep myselfoccupied with strengthening exercises, organising the household, batch cooking etc, just to take my mind off things From the very start, my husband, of 33 years, has ""said"" hes right behind me, supporting me in all my decisions (I've been off work sick due to severe arthritis since Sept 2014, and am being made redundant on May 12th 2015!!) yet last night he turned round and said hes sick of the ""poor me"" act!! Im bloody gobsmacked, and not really sure how I should feel. I need his support in this, Ive tried to get him to read some of the blogs/personal experiences from this lovely forum, and also tried to get him to watch a ""YouTube"" of a TKR, but he just says he knows what it involves and doesnt need to do anything else.
Im sure that, having read plenty of other peoples experiences, that the emotional cyclone that Im going through is normal, but tonight I feel like a complete wreck and cant stop crying......

"Hello all - I've followed loads of you with your progress, & whilst mine has been slower (Right TKR on 28th October) - I was slowly getting there. Last week at Physio,  I reached a 95 degree bend, could walk upstairs albeit clinging on the the LHS rail, cannot walk downstairs, started driving our automatic car 2 weeks ago (but I'm the first to admit my confidence is not back to the old me) - walk with a limp, but felt slowly & surely I was getting there. Over the weekend, we had our 4 & 6 year old Grandchildren to stay - I went up our 3 flights of stairs (slowly) at least a dozen times - actually showed them all the excercices as they too have followed this op. - nothing too much out of the ordinary, but yesterday was a painful day from hell. The knee feels as if it is in a brace - I can actually feel & hear a clicking noise now, which I hate, & my limp is more pronounced. What the heck happened? I had stopped all meds on the previous Friday, apart from bedtime ones, as I still find sleeping hard, but today have decided I must need them still, so have ordered a further prescription. I'm 14 weeks for goodness sake - a quarter of a precious year feeling dreadful - am I alone in going backwards?

"I went for my 13 week post op review with the surgeon yesterday These are the things I found out:
1.My bend is about 130-135 he said that is about the maximum I should be looking for and not to try to get any further as I could cause damage.
2.My knee still has swelling and redness to the front around the cap but not to worry that will gradually reduce taking anything up to a year.
3. There is no problem for me to lift 30 -40 kilos.
4. I can kneel on the knee but shold use a cushion or knee pads.
5. Tubular support bandage can now be left off and not worn unless I feel I need it.
6. Exercises to be stopped and just carry on and live a normal life as I would have been doing before the op.
So that is that as far as he is concerned he said to see him in 3 years for a review. It has been an emotional journey and it is not yet finished but now my knee will not be my every waking hour concern and apart from those occasional twinges that it likes to give me I will try to forget it and go back to a normal life. I hope this might answer some questions that some of you may have had and inspire you all to press on with all the exercises, that are required after this operation.
I have had the support of loving wife that has been taking great care of me and doing all the household chores that we would normally have shared giving me the opportunity of concentrating on my recovery. Good luck to you all.
Regards Paul

"Just wanted to say that at 13 weeks now I feel that I am well on the road to recovery.  Have been driving since christmas which gave me my independence back and I am now due back at work next Monday,9 Feb on a phased return.
Had my first soak in the bath last night and I surprised myself that I could get in and out without too many problems.  My husband was on call just in case I couldn't get out but I managed to raise myself up to stand up and climb out of the bath.  I also noticed that as I was topping up the water I was sat cross legged and hadn't realised. Only thing I can't do like most others is kneel, that thought feels me with utter dread.
Onwards and upwards now, we all get there eventually!

"Hi all,
I'm at nine weeks post op from having a tibial tubercle transfer (patella realignment), lateral release, capsulorrhaphy and arthroscopy. I was in a straight leg brace for two weeks post op and my main challenge is to get flexion back into my knee.
I was just wondering what everyone else's routines are like; are you still seeing a physical therapist of some sort? How are you tackling your home exercises?
I've been going to see an osteopath/occupational therapist for my rehab three times a week since day three post op and we've been working on my gait and my posture as well as bending and strengthening the knee. On my other days I swim and bounce the leg in the pool, I do stair climbs and descends, and I also have my bike on an indoor trainer doing VERY slow cycling. He pretty much has doing everyday activities rather than lots of repetitive exercises. I was driving again at about 5 weeks and I ditched the crutches around the same time.
Cheers,

"hi all, 
I've always had problems with my knee but towards the end of last year it started swelling and becoming too painful to walk, get out of a chair, etc.  
I had an MRI which shows a ""degenerative"" cartilage tear in the meniscus. I'm not even 30 yet. My GP said I will probably need surgery and I'm now waiting for a hospital appointment. 
My question is about the symptoms really.  The pain seems to come and go but is generally getting worse.  The swelling is so bad by the end of the day I can hardly bend my knee at all.  My knee is aching all the time even at rest, driving is a problem, sitting/bending/turning are all problems.  Strangely walking isn't too painful. 
I'm really fed up with it. I can't tolerate ibuprofen or naproxen.  Paracetamol and Codeine helps but not completely.   I'm told the wait for orthopedics is months and the idea of surgery scares me anyway. 
Can they do joint injections for this type of problem?  Has anyone got any tips with coping with it?
thanks

The muscle above my knee is so painful only manage a couple of knee raises before I have to stop and then only move about 2 inches!

There was a lot of swelling which has come down a wee bit, but there was also bruising which pretty much went from her hip down to her calve.  I dunno if this is normal.  The bruise went bright purple and now looks like its getting better and is yellowish.
another thing is her leg near the incision is quite warm.  She is putting ice packs to help with the swelling...but im unsure if the fact that her leg is warm is normal. 
please any input would be most helpful.

"Hello again .. Bee away for a while dealing with my back, a bad flu bug etc. and partly through being ill and partly through my own laziness and not exercising I have gone backwards and feel stuck and am now panicking.  
I am about 14 weeks post TKR right knee for osteoarthritis. At the beginning, other than the pain and swelling, sleep deprivation etc being very tired and miserable ... All the usual., I thought I was doing reasonably well and had got to about 115 bend, I think, at about 9 weeks. Then I began to have trouble with my back which was fused almost. Year ago now ... So the back was done Feb 2014 and the knee followed October 2014 ... A marathon and the knee and back were affecting eachother . I was in a lot of pain and got very lazy with the knee exercises ... Have now started with a personal trainer who is trained in all sorts of Pilates etc and is also a sports therapist. He has given me good treatment for the knee including some lymphatic massage and has started me on new range of exercises for the knee ... and I am beginning to trust him.
My worry is that although my energy levels are finally rising and I can do more in the house, going out etc., I feel I have lost momentum with the knee and my bend has gone backwards to about 90. I can go upstairs with difficulty but still not downstairs ... The brain and knee seem not to connect going down. So, i feel like progress has stopped ... Will it start again or have stopped moving forward bend wise and this is now as good as it gets? 
I have a treadmill at home and he says I can do that, slowly which I hope will help because I have not been able to take proper walks due to back pain. He also suggested the static bicycle ..which I have seen many people write about here.  
Main question is can I regain progress lost?

But the big muscle above my knee is very very weak and on trying to do exercises that raise the leg the muscle shakes as under a lot of strain. So I've got to work on that. Bk with physio in 2 weeks. It's very hard to keep the momentum going. Not able to use a static pedal cycle yet as can't turn the pedals. But hopefully will come. Got 2 use 2 crutches as although knee itself feels quite good and stable. Due to muscle weakness sometime my leg gives way.

Bend is just over 90 and hasn't really increased significantly in the last 2 weeks which sort of surprised me. Im definitely stronger and there are things I can do today that I couldn’t 2 weeks ago so I don't really understand it. For those who have maybe experienced this before, is this something to be concerned about. Is it normal to be fixed at one position for a length of time before the knee decides to move forward again?
Could be just a bit of patience on my part. Don't know. That hasn't always been one my strongest characteristics. haha

"A few months ago I had keyhole surgery to find out what was wrong with my knee as scans were not showing any faults.
It turned out that I had no ACL (which I have just had reconstructed), damage cartilage (which they cleaned) and a small hole in my tibia.
I was told that this hole was probably cause by constant trauma to the knee, I however am not convinced. The shape looked to round and the position was directly behind my entrance wound. I had also never had pain in this position prior to the surgery.
It has now been 3-4 months since this first operation and 6 days since having my ACL reconstructed and I am getting a lot of pain from the position of the hole.
Is it possible for keyhole surgery to damage bone?
I was hopping that surgery would fix my weak knee that didn't give constant pain but since my first op pain is a daily problem
Many thanks,
Steve

"just as i thought i was really getting somewhere, my knee starts making creaking noises as i practice bending. No pain just noise. Now, 2 hours later ifind that my knee is very painful again. pain on the outside and in the centre. I really hope it doesnt last. It seems to be the pattern however and i guess we just push on and weather the storm. I also wish i could find a better sleeping position as my knee has started doing stretches of its own in the night which are a bit disconcerting. Anyone else experience this?

"This is really weird.  At about week 6 post op I was so absolutely thrilled with my new knee.  Most everything back to what I would consider a ""normal"" knee - no swelling, little pain, fine with up and down stairs, walking about a mile a day, cycling for 15 minutes daily.  
Last week my knee started hurting again and the swelling has returned. It feels so stiff.   I am now 9 weeks post op.  
Sleeping at night has always been a problem and continues.
Any suggestions?

I have been in a lot of pain the last few days and find the exercises so painful, it's hit and miss whether I do them or not. I need a stick if I walk very far as my knee just gives way.

"Hi.
Since Xmas I have been experienceing this burning pain in the left knee cap and just above. It happens when the joint has been in a bent position for some time, (In the night - sitting still etc).  If I try to straighten the leg it really hurts and I have to slowly work the joint till it settles down. When I forget and stand up sometimes I have to sit back down as I cannot take my weight on it. I Have Rheumatoid arthritis which has been more active since I fractured my shoulder last summer and the pain is similar to that I get in my fingers, again if they have been still for some time. As if the tendon is sticking.
Once it is gone it is fine untill the joint is still for too long again. I can walk fine with no pain at all.
Does this sound familiar to anyone. I am on Plaquenil  and Meloxicam full dose where I was on half before.
Thank you for reading

I am now starting to get a tingling sensation down my shin - almost feels like someone is pinging rubber bands at it. Does this sound like the nerves are repairing and the knee cap will shortly come round ??!! My knee is always really hot but I guess this means there is still internal healing going on.

"Hello Everyone,
Well, It's really 5 weeks and 3 days but close enough.
Went to see my surgeon today and the outcome was quite favourable.
Their practice is to try and get people to a 120 degree bend in 6 weeks,
Of course they realize this is an ideal case and not everyone recovers at the same rate.
It's simply a target they shoot for.
My bend is currently at 95 and they were well pleased. During the examination, they didn't only look at the bend but also the flex in the Knee (don't ask me how they determine that). They said my knee still had good flex and as long as that some flex is present, there is more ROM to be had. I see them in another 6 weeks and if I keep doing as I am, they figure I should be at 120 or pretty close at that time.
As far as the exercises go, it's their practice to do them 3X per day and as hard as possible. I understand there's tremendous controversy in this area but that’s how they approach it.
I was also approved for driving. I figure short trips for now are probably in order but don’t think I could handle long trips right yet.
I also believe now that much of the anxiety I had was based on certain comments that his secretary made. Maybe her warped sense of humour or some misunderstanding, who knows. As far as I'm concerned it's water under the bridge and all is on track now.
Over the first three weeks, this op is tough, tough, tough.
From there to this point has been a real mixed bag. Some good days and some real low ones. Times when I figured I'll never be able to do the thing I used to, but if your in this boat now, I want to assure folks that things DO GET BETTER! Never Give Up.
However hard, stay faithful to the exercises, Ice, elevate and take meds an hr or so before your workout. Now, only if could get some sleep! haha

"deal fellow TKR champions ... i just wanted to give you an update on how my much dreaded mobilisation went. first of all, thanks to all of you who where thinking and rooting for me. all the positive vibes reached me!  for anybody new joining, i had my TKR exactly 12 weeks ago and really, really struggled with the bend.  my physio said it was like a wall.  on a bad day we would get 90 degrees, on a good one, 100.  and this was with bendy machine at home, physio 3 times a week, acupuncture once a week and kinesiology once a week.  
i went in on tuesday morning, very nervous and worried so they gave me a calming pill which helped until i went into anesthesisa where they struggled to place the spinal catheter (similar to women going in for a long birthing process).  this was very,very unpleasant but the next i knew, they were putting me under and 10 minutes later it was all done.
once i got to my room - very swanky room which i had to myself for 2 days on my own, a complete bonus and a gift from the gods as i should have been up with the masses -  i was immediately put on the knee bendy machine which i quickly got a 125 degree bend on.  my doc came and told me that i could have been at the physio for a thousand years and i wouldn't have got the necessary bend, it took considerable forcing to get the scaring to give and promptly upped the machine to 130! this is where it stayed for 48 hours solid, minus pee breaks and sitting on the side of the bed to eat.  during these 48 hours i was on the pain catheter PLUS my usual meds so zero pain ... also zero sleep but hey ho!  they then turned the pain catheter off and i was really, really concerned the pain would kick in but no and so i stayed on the machine for another 12 hours, always at 130 degrees.
i came home yesterday, walking without sticks but with a limp.  my leg feels like it has run the marathon.  or gone under the steam roller.  very, very sore but not stabbing pain.  i came in, greeted the cats and collapsed in bed for 3 hours, dead to the world.
today i went and got some arnica c200 globuli, some homeopathic stuff recommended for sports injuries and healing of scars, and was told to take 10 globuli once a week as it is powerful stuff.  i took it and the effect was immediate.  amazing stuff if you can get your hands on it.  i continue to go on the bendy machine at home as well, but this model will ""only"" go to 120 degrees and because the knee is sore, i have to gradually get up there but get there i do.  remember, this is passive so i will be working on my active bend as well.  my leg feels like it has NO muscle strength at all.  am seeing my phsyio 4 times next week as my doc is determined it won't go back to my paltry 80.
so that is it.  time will tell if it was worth it but so far i am delighted.  and the way the pain got managed was fantastic.  so far, no regrets!

"Had my manipulation done on 12-31. Had no end of issues with the epidural that was suppose to make everything better. Instead of numbing my left leg it only numbed my right which meant I could not do anything for the first 36 hours. Finally had them take it out and just went with oral meds. Before manipulation I could only bend 95degrees and hurt so bad 24/7. Pain is much better now and I have a CPM machine at home that bends it to 115.

"I ruptured a Baker's cyst behind my left knee 3 days ago. 73 yo & Type 1 diabetic but very active & fit. I've read all the info but still have question. I keep it elevated & iced a good amount of the time.& the swelling is down considerably in the early AM.  It is not too stiff when I get up. After a period of time the fluid returns to the whole leg & it become more swollen & firm with the calf muscle becoming quite painfull & tight.  If I keep walking the pain & the muscles become more flexible & I have considerably less issue with walking. There in lies the dilema. Should I not move round to get the looseness or should I continue to keep it elevated.  I'm seeing my GP on Tues 20/1/2015?

Both my knees are still swollen and still quite numb over the old knee cap area and on the sides,the swelling is hindering my flexing/ bending exercises and I just don't know how I should be doing, because a double knee replacement is a lot rarer than the normal single procedure. I am going between slight euphoria and periods of being quite down cos' I just don't have anyone or anything to compare myself against. How long does the swelling,numbness last is the main concern for me at this point. If anyone is able to provide some support or advice I would be very grateful. I am a 52 year old male.

"Hello all. I am one day off 6 weeks now. My bend at the physio on friday was 80 which he was pleased with, an increase of 5 from the previous week. I was able to lift my leg off the bed for the first time which had eluded me so far so was pleased with that. However i still find it very hard to sit in one position downstairs in the lounge and have to keep coming back to bed to get some peace from my restless leg. Exercises are going ok but the frequent unexpected pains make me nervous. I think that i havent really accepted my new knee as part of my body! Sleep is improvingwhich helps a lot but my life is still very far from normal. It seems very far away right now still. Also i am due to stop wearing the dreaded stockings but i worry that my leg will swell up as it has before when i left them off. My scar has a small area that is still weeping mostly i feel because of wearing the stockings i have had to cover it. Hope it starts to improve soon!

"Hi, I am new to this forum and just needed some information. Recently I joined a gym began to do cardio, I have been doing jogs and sprints on a treadmil for about 30 minutes at a time and about 5 days ago when I got home from gym I started to feel very slight pain just under my knee on the inside (left, from my point of view). I didn't think much of it and the next day I went back on the treadmil doing my usual routine and about 2-3 minutes in the pain came back but a lot worse than the previous day so I stopped and went on to weights. Anyway, the next morning I began to limp and I couldn't put any weight on my right leg, I've never had any issues before with my knee or leg so I just assumed it's a pulled muscle or something minor and will recover within a day or two. Now, a couple days gone and the pain is getting worse, there is no swelling or anything it just hurts on one certain area. I am 24 years old, slightly overweight. I will be visiting doctor on Monday but just need to know if anyone has experienced something similar before and how serious this is?
Thanks, and sorry for long post!

"I will be going to the doctor with this but I wouldn't mind having some input from folks who may have had the same symptoms as to what might be affecting me. To start with, I am 66 years old and consider myself to be as fit as one can be at this age. A daily part of my routine is going for a 2 hour brisk walk through a snow covered trail in the woods and as I said, I do this every day. About 6 weeks ago I began to develop a pain in the left knee that is not disabling - I can walk just fine but I do feel it all the time. A squat position is out of the question however due to the sharp pain that induces and I can't do this either (see picture) since it too brings on acute pain. I was hoping time would take care of it, but after 6 weeks with no change, it's obvious that this will not be the case. Any idea of what might be causing this?
Cheers, John

now my surgeon has me wondering where in the world he is even coming from.
4 days ago my bend was at 80 and he wanted to see 100 by the end of the week.
Well, I reached 85 (75 just 7 days before) and my physio was quite happy because Im making solid positive progress. Im only 3 weeks post op.
Today I call the surgeon and he now wants 120 by next wed. I say thats absurd.
Not even reasonable. They continue saying that if its not 120 I need to go to rehab team where they will force the bend! Now I'm not only worried but really ticked off!
This is insane!
In all honesty, that was the secretary relayng his message and she might not have a clue 
as to what will actually take place but at the same time she out not to be making statements to patients that belong in a horror movie!

Now this basically has me pretty freaked out. I have struggled to get this knee to bend to 80 so far. Is it even reasonable to get it to jump to 100 in 4 days?
If I don't get it there, anyone have any idea what procedure they might use to get it there and has anyone been through this?

my surgeon and i believe that the improved bend has come from my new medication cocktail.  one of the meds is lyrica and i personally think this is what is helping me.  LOTS of side effects so not entirely happy about it but as long as it helps with the bend, i will continue taking it.
in the meantime, i am also having acupuncture.  i had my first session on friday, felt rather ill afterward and then went home and slept for 4 hours straight!  have more sessions next week, so am keen to see if it helps.  i noticed on the bendy machine today, that pain sets in much, much later than in the past.  thanks to the acupuncture session?  who knows.  i am grateful in any case.  let it improve even more until december 9!

I have no pain in the area of the replacement but are experiencing a sharp sore pain directly below the knee cap (i.e top of tibia)when starting walking after rest. Not sure if this is common as part of healing or not allowing enough time for soft tissue to heal after exercise or being on my feet etc as I know it can take 12 months to fully settle.
Would like to hear if others have experienced the same.
There is no inflammation or swelling or hotness of the joint.

"Dear fellow TKRs
It is almost 12 weeks since my TKR and at last I have really turned the corner and am feeling way better.  Like everybody else, it has been a rollercoaster of pain, heat, swelling, lack of sleep, nasty drugs and occasional bouts of self-pity and depression.  BUT, it is a new year and I walk with no pain, the swelling is well on the way out though there is still some, some heat but much less, still take painkillers like paracetomol or co proxamol up to four times a day .... but no more really nasty stuff.
I generally sleep ok now, though for a while I found a pillow between the knees good, then gave it up and have now gone back to it. If I wake and the knee is hot, it is not hot enough to bother icing it.  Occasionally I use an ice pack during the evening while I watch tv.
I have had some complications with my back; I had a two level lumbar fusion back in February and the knee/back combination has been difficult at times but I think things will settle as I walk better and with better posture.
The TKR was supposed to be a doddle compared to my back op. but as you all know, the reality of TKR is a hard, painful, emotional slog.  I pray to goodness the other knee does not catch up as I hope I don't ever have to go through it again.  On the other hand ......... take 10 to 12 weeks out of your whole life and come out of it with a less painful knee, even if it feels 'odd' ... it is worth it in the end.
This next bit of recuperation must be to get fitter, lose some weight and use my new mobility to best advantage.  I have a 115 degree bend, can walk around quite well now, cooked Christmas Day lunch and did not have to retreat to bed for a couple of days afterwards to recuperate.
To everybody out there suffering, afraid, despairing etc .... hang in there as there IS light at the end of the tunnel!
HAPPY NEW YEAR

My PT tells me I am doing great - have over a 120 degree bend and 1 degree on straightening the leg.  I can ride the stationary bike for 10 minutes, but only after exercising the knee for a while to get it more mobile.  My question is I experience horrible cold.  I just can't ever seem to get warm enough.  Further my hair is falling out.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Am I on target, or am I way behind in my recuperation?

"Hello folks,
Not sure what's happing here. Maybe I just need to take some time to vent.
This knee replacement sure is a roller coaster. Some days are ok, and there have even been times when I went a few hours with hardly any pain at all so I figured I was progressing pretty good, but all of a sudden tonight, BAM! for some reason my pain level shot up to a 9.
I really pushed the exercises today. Maybe to much, who knows. Iv'e also taken some older Percocets I had in the house today. Maybe they were no good. Again, who knows?
About an hr ago I doubled up on my normal pain meds and things are settling down a bit now. Talk about ups and downs. This is one wonky ride.
Thanks for listening folks. It really is a wonderful help.

I've also replaced my dressing a couple of times as I have two scabs that are quite sore. The main reason I have kept my knee covered is that I have a dog and I'm frightened of her catching the scabs off.

"I had total knee replacement on July 21, 2014.  Five days in hospital.  Surgery went well.  Pain management was good, pain pills plus Ibuprofen every 6 hours.  Recuperating well until I was taken off of pain meds.  Found out they were masking an ulcer I had developed in my stomach from the Ibuprofen.  Such pain.  After three visits to ER got proper diagnosis and feeling better.  :0)  Released from physical therapy with 110 bend on operated knee and 120 on unoperated knee.   PT said that normal use would help the bend increase.  Try walking up and down stairs normally but sometimes just do not like the pain, so I walk up one step at a time.  Pain is manageable most of the time with Tylenol.  Knee very still upon sitting with it bent for any length of time.  I just ordered a peddling machine to use while I am sitting watching TV.  My surgeon said it would take up to a year for it to really be well.  Scar tissue inside causing pain when skin hits replacement inside.  This will subside he said.  
     I am 67 years old and am glad I had it done.  The pain before was so bad I stopped going places.  Nothing stops me now from going shopping, food shopping etc. etc.  
     After considering all that was cut in the surgery I can understand why there is pain and stiffness.  If I were younger I think it would have been easier.  I hear of people having both knees done at one time.  To me a crazy idea.  I met a lady at Cracker Barrel yesterday.  She was at lease 15 years older than me and she had two canes.  Had both knees replaced at once and is really having a hard time.  :0(  
     I do not know if its my imagination or not, but it feels extremely cold inside of my knee.  Is it possible to feel cold from the replacement inside there?  Just wondering.  
     Otherwise hoping this may help someone else.

"Hello folks. Just thought I would post a 15 day update.
Had staples removed yesterday, another milestone. It wasn't real painful having them removed but I did feel every one of them none the less. Getting comfortable and getting a good nights sleep is still the worst. Still cant sleep more than about 90 min max without getting up in pain. I'm on Percocet which helps but doesn't manage the pain as well as I hoped. Tried some melatonin last night for sleep.  The doc gave me some sleeping pills yesterday but thought I would try this first. During the night I woke up just as often but I got back to sleep much quicker so overall a much better nights sleep.
Has Anyone else tried melatonin before? Maybe tonight I will give the sleeping pills a try.
Oh I did ask 2 diff pharmacists and the doc about taking nytol to help sleep.
Each said there was no issue when taken with Percocet. Not sure about other meds though.
As far as my knee goes, there are definite improvements but it is still stiff, stiff, stiff and 
painful. Been doing exercises 3x a day and always icing right afterwards. Also still very swollen. I am typically not easily discouraged but man, this is draining.
If I come across any miraculous shortcuts or anything to help sleep, ease the pain or bring comfort in any way I will be sure to pass it on.
Until next time. God bless

"Hi guys
I injured my left knee 12 years ago thanks to a bad rugby tackle; tearing the tendons and grinding down some of the cartilage (if I remember right). Small, short-term, infrequent pains have occured over the years but nothing that has stopped my playing football and rugby when I was younger (now 26), nor has it really been a concern. For the past 3 years I haven't found time to do sports regularly; my work means I travel a lot but it also keeps me fairly active probably 1/3 of the time (diving of moving boats, swimming, tonnes of walking etc), when I'm not sat behind a desk.
Diet-wise I eat fairly healthily; as healthy as is possible while working in SE Asia, without sacrificing actually liking the food I eat. Additionally I have absolutely no other health problems and have been for a full medical in April this year.
However over the past 2 weeks I'm feeling not just my 'bad' knee all the time but my right knee also, either they ache, or hurt when I walk or I get a short sharp pain in the 'bad' one when I go to sit down.
I am 6ft 5"" and accept that taller people commonly have knee problems but I'm wondering how I might be able to improve the health of my knees to the point where I don't have to think about them if I want to play football or my girlfriend asks me try yoga again (collapsed last time; knee pain when squatting).
Does anyone have any advice on supplements I should maybe take, exercises I can do or anything else that may improve the situation?
Thanks in advance,
James

"Hi,
I have recently been recommended I have a rotational osteotomy and would like someone's thoughts on the matter. Starting at the beginning...
About 8 years ago I had pain in my knees. More so in the right. The pain was worse when my legs were bent, such as sitting at work. Walking was fine. There was also clicking evident. The pain got very severe at one point and I had been to the doctors on the NHS They thought I had rheumatoid arthritis so sent me to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist said i don't have RA, my quads are weak so sent me to physio. The physiotherapist said my quads are too strong..... this went on a while as it takes weeks to get appointments with each. I got sick of waiting so I began stretching lots each day. I do martial arts so I had done lots of stretching in my life but I was not exercising much at this point. I then saw a private physiotherapist who believed my patellas were maltracking. he taped the worse knee up, pushing it to the outside. My knee felt perfect and the pain was gone so he gave my exercises to build the outside muscle on my leg up to pull the knee cap across. After a year or so my knees were fine.... some discomfort if sitting with my legs bent for too long but ok.
However, about a year ago the pain in my knees came back along with lots of clicking which hurts. My legs are more or less ok when they are straight, so I sit with them on a cushion outwards. When I straigten my legs they make a loud crack which hurts. I feel the knee cap go over something and it cracks in the same place. I can feel it move over a lump and even see it. I do a martial arts a few times a week as well as weight training, along with a lot of stretching as i did when I had the problem before. This takes the pain away for a while. For kicking, my legs click the first 1 or 2 kicks, then it is fine for a while. I had the same problems with the NHS as before so I went private and saw a surgeon who will treat me through the NHS. He had CT scans and ""Rotational CT scan shows external rotation of the right knee to be 51 degrees and the left knee 54 degrees"". I'm not sure what that means really. He recommended a rotational osteotomy but I'd like more information. Mostly, is this likely to cure my symptoms? I don't mind going through a large operation but I worry that it may not have been the cause or possibly make it worse. Also, would I be able to kick a bag eventually after such a procedure? I find it hard to believe after having my legs broken in such a way that I could kick into a heavy bag will full force.
I went to Spain a few weeks ago for a second opinion. I went to a knee clinic that has a lot of experience. At first he told me not to do the operation as other methods should be tried first. He also said my right knee was swollen so he drained it and gave me a cortisone injection and also gave me Vimovo to take. He was then going to do a durolane injection a couple of weeks later. After about 4 days my knee felt much better but a few days later it felt like it was swelling up again. I went back and he could not do the injection as my knee was too swollen. So he sent me for an MRI scan. That showed my bursa was inflammed. He said it may be becaise of maltracking and said that the operation the English surgeon recommended may be needed after all. We are going to try Durolane again so he drained my knee and gave another cortisone injection and I go back in two weeks. Hopefully it wont be swollen. He said its strange to swell up so quickly so I had a blood test for Rheumatoid arthiritis and also the fluid from my knee was taken to be examined. The blood test came back negative and I'm waiting for him to come back about the fluid. (I have the lab test results but it's just levels). 
Could anybody help me or have any more info they could share. Sorry if its a bit long.

"I'm interested to hear from othersabout their knee stiffness following surgery. My PKR was Juky 23 and I still have major pain and stiffness after sitting or sleeping.  I'm not too bad if I keep moving.   Hot bath gives me 100 percent relief.  I also have a vibrating exercise machine and feel wonderful after 10 minutes of massage on it.  I've even gone back to using my can for my first few steps in the morning.  I guess I fear this isn't normal.  I saw my surgeon on October 2 and he said probably soft tissue damage.  I've also started biking outside about 15 minutes or so a day..no hills just a nice smooth ride.  This doesn't give new any discomfort at all.  I feel it's better to keep exercising and not give in to the pain and want to do nothing.
Wondering if others have stiffness like this did it get better and what do you think helped you.
i have people say it's been too long I shouldn't have pain, nd others who say the opposite...it takes months and months possibly.

Well, it does all that. But the most amazing thing it does is, it has almost disappeared my scar! 
Its not got anything about scars on the box. But my scar is now flat and smooth and pale.

"Hi, Just thought I would share some information regarding my recent total knee replacement, done 0n 9/12/2014.
I am a 58 year old male, residing in South Australia. I came here with my parents from the UK when I was 12 (never been back). They were from Ipswich in Suffolk.
I broke my left leg here, back in 1972 in a motorcycle accident and have tended to throw my weight to the right side ever since and wore out the right knee. No cartlidge left, bone on bone and VERY painful. I also had a triple bypass done in 2011 due to some bad genes (have 2 cousins in UK that had to have same op at same age!)
Anyway I am recovering pretty well so far. Spent 1 night in intensive care and 3 more days in hospital and home on day four. I live with my wife and 23 year old daughter. Compared to open heart surgery, this has been a breeze so far.
I still have the waterproof dressing on and have attended my first physio class. 1 hour in a small gym and 1 hour in a pool. Just starting to be able to sleep again at night, after 2 weeks of very restless nights. I only take 2 x Panadol Forte' at night, and can get through the day without needing pain killers. I can bend the knee past 90 degrees, but it often takes a few minutes of 'warming up'. I can walk a fair distance with one stick, but can generally move around the house without one. I have lost about 5Kg and feel pretty well overall, although I was a bit constipated for the first few days at home. I used Metamucil and ate plenty of fresh fruit and natural yogurt which helped.
I am generally a pretty optimistic person, and I am sure the mental aspect is important in any sugical recovery. I picture myself back at work (due to start on 19/01/2015) and enjoying life with ny now my pain free knee.
Aside from some residual soreness, it actually is a joy to walk on, compared to pre-op where I hobbled everywhere in agony and lived on Panadol Osteo.
Anyway I hope some of this information is helpful and please feel free to email me with any questions.
Cheers, Paul

"Back in July I came off my motorbike. I think I mostly landed on my left knee (though I don't remember as the impact gave me concussion so I recall next to nothing of the actual accident). I was taken to hospital where the knee was X-rayed, which apparently showed no break. I was told to rest it, take painkillers, apply ice packs and perhaps try arnica cream.
Unsurprisingly the knee was swollen and painful for a while afterwards but has mostly returned to normal now. Sometimes it does ache a bit if it's had a slight knock or anything, but nothing very troublesome.
However, skin over one half of the kneecap remains numb. I've mentioned this to my GP recently and they didn't seem concerned, but I expected it to have returned to normal by now.
Anyone know if this is likely to go away eventually, or what might be causing it?

"I'm a 16 year old female I injured my knee 9 months ago playing football in a block challenge. I went to the doctor about the injury and he said I had streched a ligament in my knee . I the got referred physiotherapy and had ultrasound treatment they said I had pulled my lcl. I rested for 3 months no physical activity except walking. I went back to the doctor in October about my knee as I still had pain and couldn't do any physical activity without significant pain on the inside of my knee. He has referred my to orthopaedics but I could be waiting a while to be seen. My knee has pain on the inside back and inner side o my knee especially when running, changing pace and jumping but is painful during any physical exercise, it is sore when walking sometimes as well I also have significant swelling still in my calf caused by the trauma of the injury. Can anyone suggest what could be causing the pain or what to do to reduce the pain whilst I wait for my appointment.

"I saw my surgeon a few days ago for a 5 week follow-up and he was not willing to do a manipulation on my knee yet. Said it would bleed at this stage and cause mor scarring, so need to wait for the 12 week stage. In the meantime he's hopeful I can still get the bend without manipulation. It's been at 85 for about 3 weeks now. So, he upped my pain pills again, and has precribed a JAS brace, which I can't get until it is approved by Medicare, and that may take 3 weeks!  Apparently this brace bends your knee for you but at a much lower pain level and a much slower speed than the physio uses. You use it 3 times/day for 30 mins. The reviews on the JAS website are great but that's to be expected. Just wondered if anyone on this forum had tried one?

"I am now 4 weeks after TKR. I'm walking without aid, have a bend of 120 degrees and manage stairs fine.
I have two problems though. The first is that I get a stabbing pain in my knee when just sitting. Everything can be fine then out of the blue ""ouch"" the stabbing pain hits. I find the best way to clear it is to stand and take a short walk.
The second problem is sleeping at night. It's not pain that keeping me awake it's just that I cannot seem to relax into sleep. I will get up, watch an hour of TV, go back to bed and maybe sleep for an hour. Then I'm up again. Dr. gave me some sleeping pills but they seem to have no effect at all.
Anyone else experience these problems?

"Hello All
I am 16 + 1 and my knee feels worse than ever in terms of tightness and pain when I bend (my bend was just over 110 three weeks ago).
My knee feels very rubber bandy and painful when I bend and there is terrible tightness at the back as well as the front of my knee and a constant tightness when just sitting. It is like
I am not taking any medication as I have no idea what to try now; my knee is still a little swollen and numb at the side.
My Consultant has said it is something to do with being a younger age (49)and my knee being in a rush to heal BUT REALLY??
Earlier this afternoon I did a few bends when I heard and felt a painful big crack in my knee :-0. This has made me feel very worried.
I last saw Consultant 4 weeks ago (next appt is 9th Feb) and don't want to be a pain to him but I am finding this extremely difficult to deal with especially (as discussed in a different thread ) I had to go back to work 5 weeks ago, etc.
Is anyone feeling the same at this stage? Is this just the healing process as I am starting to doubt it and am worried in particular at being stuck at 110 as using the stairs is painful and getting in and out of the car is difficult.
Thank you!

"Hi, I dislocated my knee 3 weeks ago today, stupidly  last Thursday I tripped over my crutches and ended up back in a& e, fortunately  no further damage to my knee, but the nurse I saw told me to raise my leg, I told her that I couldn't and that I had seen my consultant on 10th December and she had said it's too early to be messing around  with my knee. The nurse insisted I raise my leg , which I did but holding my leg as it is really heavy, she then snapped and said don't use your hands to lift you leg, I tried hard to raise it and in doing so I pulled my groin quite  bad, she wasn't bothered and was just moaning saying I should have been doing leg raises! I'm due to see my consultant on Xmas eve, should I tell her as I'm quite paranoid now! I'm also really concerned as I've lost so much muscle tone and my knee feels so tight, I have tried to bend it but can only do it  ever so slightly. What should I expect to happen as I've know idea and sick of worrying! Thank you in advance x

"I'm getting on for around six months post op now and It occured to me this morning, while getting out of my car after having arrived at work, that it seems to be much easier than it was previously.  So I paid attention to exactly how I was managing to get out of the car more easily.
It transpires that I still have to have the door wide open, and the seat as far back as possible, to enable me to get my right leg out of the car (right knee being the replaced knee joint), I swing both my legs out and 'ground' them, and then shuffle towards the edge of the seat and using my right elbow/arm as a lever against the outside of the door pillar, use that to come to a standing position.  It all sounds very complicated and fairly slow, but it happens 'almost' without thinking about it, and in a couple of seconds.  I have no pain and all seems very second nature, but in my heart I know it's anything but natural.
I just wonder if we sort of adapt ourselves into whatever task we're doing, so it doesn't hurt, or whether, we are actually improving.

"Had my TKR two months ago tomorrow. He also had to do a lateral retinacular release. That caused so much swelling and brusing. I am in The U.S. My doctor said mine was was the toughest TKR he has done. Still swollen and am only at 94 degrees flexion. Pain is non stop. Doctor told me to wean myself off pain meds but I still need them at night. Saw my physical therapist a few days ago and she commented that it was strange that she can not feel my patella. Anyone else have a lateral release? Very frustrated with all of this. Am only 50 and have to work full time as I am a widow and the only breadwinner.

"On Monday my physio was cracking open the bottle of bubbly, on Tuesday she was spreading doom and gloom, telling me the knee was getting less and less pliable. I went into a blue funk :-(
I am on the machine for hours but admittedly I had noticed that I was now having to bite my teeth at 115. So perhaps it will go down even more? Plus I have a stabbing pain where the hidden scar is and I have gone back to limping in major fashion.
The doctor clearly said that after the manual bending and if I could get through 60 hours on the machine, I would not have to worry afterwards. Clearly W R O N G! I feel like such a wimp, but I am seriously running out of steam yet know giving up is not seriously an option. And I know that all I can do is exercise, exercise.
So sorry to whinge but also felt it was worth sharing as e.g. Caz and Jean are considering doing this. Just so you know that it may not be - or not immediately be - the answer to all ills.
I will keep at it. God I am sick of having the knee be the center of my universe.

The only thing is that every time I rest I go into very deep sleeps. Not at night time unfortunately. I wake up not knowing what day it is. The sleeps only last about half hour.

My knees are both still very swollen and numb on the front and sides. Ny staples come out in 3 days time and I have my first visit to the physio dept the following week. I'm still walking with crutches and it is still a big effort to move my legs. I just don't know how I am doing on my ""road to recovery"".

I never thought in million years it would be this hard, my knee doing well. Push myself with the bend, exercises etc. Still can't walk very well but my physio lady is so supportive and always puts things in perspective... like I have walked bad for years, some of it is muscle wastage, some of its physicological... but she always praises me... so in that respect I am very fortunate.still use a stick and beat myself up for that but roll on spring when hopefully I can ditch it.
This forum is amazing and I just wanted to say thank you and merry Christmas to you all. I do think we should all write a book!! Some parts would be difficult and some funny... using your bra to carry your phone in, sliding food across the floor with a crutch... I could go on!! But always cheered me up.

"I was hoping someone may be able to offer some advice please.?
This year, 2014 I've had two arthroscopy on the same knee. One in February and the second in October. The problem was in the inside of my knee, pain from sitting to standing, full leg extension. Cartlidge tears, wear and tear.               The surgeon called it bad luck. Is it common to have two in one year?
My second recovery was going well until the other week, when the pain was coming back. It hurts if I sit down for a long period, and still making clicking noises. Not sure just to leave it and put up with it, do some home exercises, and rest for a few months.
i was previously doing some exercise, aqua fit, walking, very very low impact, but since the second surgery I've now cancelled my gym membership.

"We have done physical therapy , shots and NSAIDS , pain is worse , I was told I had a tear and needed surgery , no MRI needed. MRI completed anyway , no tear shown
HISTORY:
Pain.
PROCEDURE:
MRI left knee
COMPARISON:
None.
TECHNIQUE:
Axial, sagittal, and coronal fat-saturated T2 weighted imaging was
obtained. Sagittal proton density and T1-weighted imaging was also
obtained. Exam was done without the use of IV or intraarticular
contrast.
FINDINGS
MEDIAL MENISCUS: Intact. There is mild mucoid degeneration seen
involving the posterior horn with no definitive extension of signal
abnormality extending towards an articular surface to signify tear.
There may be a small parameniscal cyst seen on coronal image 26 -27.
LATERAL MENISCUS: Intact.
ACL: Intact.
PCL: Intact.
MCL: Intact.
LATERAL LIGAMENTS AND TENDONS: Intact.
MEDIAL AND LATERAL RETINACULUM: Intact.
FAT PADS: Mild high T2 signal seen within the suprapatellar fat which
may reflect an element of impingement.
CARTILAGE:
Patellofemoral compartment: Areas of fissuring and surface
irregularity of the vertical ridge of the patella and medial patellar
facet with subtle subchondral reactive marrow edema within the medial
patellar facet. Mild fissuring along the lateral trochlear surface.
Medial compartment: Intact.
Lateral compartment: Mild fissuring and surface irregularity of the
lateral tibial plateau and lateral femoral condyle which is best
appreciated on coronal imaging.
EXTENSOR MECHANISM: Intact.
BONE MARROW: Normal.
OTHER: No joint effusion.
Impression
IMPRESSION:
1. No internal derangement.
2. Small parameniscal cyst seen of the posterior horn/body junction of
the medial meniscus.
3. Cartilage loss within the patellofemoral and lateral compartment as
above.
4. Mild edematous change within the suprapatellar fat which can be
seen in the setting of impingement.

"Hi, i'm a first time poster!! I am 41 and after my last surgery i have been told by my surgeon that as there is no cartilage in my right knee, that my only option is to persevere until my knee wears out enough to be replaced, I am around 15 years too young for TKR. I am struggling with this as it is having massive implications on work and family life. Since the op in February I have noticed that the knee is stiff and occassions it locks, mainly on the inside of the knee. My question is have you any advise on how to ease the locking and stiffness( i do stretches, spinning and occasionally yoga). ive recently read a post on Synvis injections, how do you access these? As you can see I have so much that i need to know/ research.
thanks

I have broke my right  foot and been using crutches for a week. With using crutches I've been putting weight and over using my left leg. 
As I was limping to the bedroom last night I heard a crunch in my left knee and I was in serious pain. 
Woke this morning and it still really hurts. 
Can anyone please give me advice on what to do or wether I should go to hospital?

My back has also become painful, possibly after two years of walking with a limp and my leg becoming slightly malformed. Very low mood doesn't seem to be improving either, very tearful, not like me at all. I abandoned the white socks yesterday despite being advised to wear them for six weeks, is this wise?

"Just thought I would ask for some advice about when is the best time to go for knee surgery.
I have suffered from arthritus on the inside of my knee for many years which is steadily getting worse. However, I can walk quite long distances and sometimes the pain disappears after walking for a while. The pain does not keep me awake at night. However, my surgeon says that the X ray is quite bad and is surprised that I can walk several miles.Because I am able to walk a few miles he feels that it is not the right time yet to have a knee replacement as he claimed that the success rate is only 80%. This is another issue. What is regarded as a successful outcome?
A couple of weeks ago things suddenly deteriorated and the pain was so bad that I could hardly walk from one room to another. I saw another surgeon who stated that my knee needed to be replaced and I happily agreed with him as the pin was so excruciating. I was counting the days until the operation!
After a few days of rest though the pain has decreased and I am back to where I was before and this afternoon I managed to walk a mile and a half.
I have heard that knee replacements should only be given to patients who are in extreme pain and who are unable to walk any distance. I do not want to wait too long so that I have caused lots of damage to the joint but I am extremely worried about this operation as although I know that most people have a positive outcome and consider that it is the best thing that they have ever done I have also heard of some operations that are unsuccessful. My phsyio tells me that she has not met any patients who have had a negative outcome and as long as people carry out their exercise routine faiothfully they are usually OK in the end.
Just be interested to hear what other folks feel about this

He has told me that there would be no benefit in repairing it and that I should have a Steroid injection instead, my opinion is that this will be a temporary solution and that the pain and discvommfort will return, this is not a permanent solution to my problem. I suspect he is trying to put me off because I will require this treatment on the national health and not private treatment

"Hi - I'm reaching out to those of you who are 17 weeks post op or more. I'm 18 weeks post op on Tuesday and I'm still having stiffness & soreness. Especially when I get up from a sitting position - it takes me several seconds to get my bearings, then I hobble out. Being in a restaurant or theatre is embarrassing. I went through this before the op and am very disheartened that I still experience it. Will it ever be ""normal"" again?? I feel it should not hurt so much at this stage ( very much so in my groin area of my TKR side) 
I don't know, maybe it has nothing to do with my TKR and arthritis in my hip is getting worse. Just wondering if others experience this.

I saw doctor and she sent me for X rays and dr told me I had MILD osteo arthritis. If anyone had my pain there is no way they would call it MILD.  It has deteriorated now and goes down the ball of my leg and even up my thigh at times.  The worst bit is the pain lying perfectly still in bed at nights. Its like a knife sticking into my leg.  Another problem I have is that my stomach does not tolerate strong painkillers so all I am taking is 8 paracetemol a day but I still suffer pain and my quality of life is deteriorating fast.  Can anyone identify with this. Thanks.

"I tore my ACL over 17 years ago and had a reconstruction.
As it turned out I avoided playing sport up until last year, partly out of fear of re- injury. As it turns out my knee held up fine last year and also for the first few rounds of this season (I play field hockey).
2 weeks ago I felt something different about my knee - not intense pain like I remember from the original injury but a dull ache and a similar sick feeling in my stomach. My knee kind of went a bit weak.
Later that evening and in fact for a number of days afterward everything would be ok but if I were in a certain position I felt a short sharp intense pain which went away as fast as it came on. Even now nearly 2 weeks later it still has a dull ache and doesnt feel stable in some positions.
When the incident happened I felt no intense pain (I would rate it at less than 5% of when I tore the acl 17 years ago).
What do people think?
Also if it were a minor tear does the ACL fibres repair themselves with time if the ACL has been grafted? (My patella was used).
Thanks so much - just wanting to get an idea of whether others would get an MRI etc.

"Hi all
In the past 6/7 weeks I have had real trouble with my knee. As an active 19 year old this is causing me a great deal of annoyance and disruption.
I play a fair amount of sport and am regualrarly active but this has been all but halted by my problem.
Perhaps about a year ago a started noticing a slight pain on the outside of my right knee after playing football each week. It would come and go so didn't think much of it initially. However in the past 6/7 weeks this pain became more intense and was on a permanent basis rather than just after sport.
Chriopractor sessions in recent weeks and via an ultrasound said a suspected lateral meniscal tear (partial). However been referred to orthopaedics for MRI to confirm and then discuss athroscopy (awaiting this).
The confusing part on my end is where has this come from? Most people I have spoken to up to this point seem to say that people with similar injuries can remember the exact time and place where they tear their meniscus. I don't remember a specific incident or event where I felt this pain in a traumatic way? It has just slowly appeared. 
Does anyone have any suggestions on what is happening to my knee?
Cheers

"Hi, I am just at nine weeks following a TKR.
I feel that in general I have made some good progress. My nights are better, I am walking short/medium distances without crutches and the pain is less all-encompassing.
But I do have an insecurity about my 'bend.' I realise that this is not the be-all-and-end-all, but I am concerned about my progress.
Three wees ago my surgeon took a look at it and told me I was 'about 110' dgrees. The next day my physio measured it at 100. And at each session since she has measured it at 105.
Now I may be wrong here but I do feel I have gone beyond the position she measured as 105, and wonder about the accuracy of the caluculation. A numbut of other people in the class also feel that her measuring may be on the 'conserevative' side.
The thing is that altough I feel my bend is bending further, I don't really know what a bend of 110/120 etc might 'look' like.
Are there any photos or illustrations anywhere that might help??
Thank you

"I'm 34 and used to be very active. I had a knee scope 4 months ago to correct a mechanical clicking on the medial side of my knee. However, in addition to just removing scar tissue, the surgeon did a notchplasty. Since then, I've been on crutches unable to walk (even in water) as my patella isn't tracking properly. This 5th knee surgery was supposed to help me back to being fully active and I've never had a worst outcome. My quad's atrophied but any quad strengthening exercises hurt like my patella is going to dislocate. I'm in pain everyday, limping, and it created PFPS on my right knee.
I've seen 3 MDs who told me that the surgeon changed the structure of my knee and there might not be anything that can correct it... In addition to the patellar maltracking, I have crepitus and totally relate to OS symptoms.

The strange thing is that the pain becomes much worse at night when she is in bed, particularly when lying on her side. Lying on her back lessens the pain. This is so counter intuitive because one would think that the pain would be the worst when the knee is in function during the day but no - although the pain is there somewhat during the day it's when the joint is unloaded that the pain is at its worst. Any idea of what could be causing these odd symptoms?

"Hello, on the eleventh of this month i had an accident on my motorcycle, i slipped on some oil outside a garage as i was stopping at a roundabout, only doing about ten miles an hour. I hit the floor on my right hand side and travelled underneith the bike for about a metre before it stopped, my right knee had been trapped between the bike and the road and i found it difficult to stand afterwards. I thought this was just some bruising because of the obvious trauma i would have suffered.
Once people had helped me and my bike off the road and i got home i put peas on my leg after noticing how swollen it had gotten and after about an hour my mum decided i needed to go to the hospital.
When i got to the hospital i had an xray and was told i may have a fracture but needed to come back the next day once the swelling went down slightly to see a fracture specialist, he moved my leg about a bit and said i don't have a fracture but i have very likely torn my cruciate ligament so i'm waiting for an MRI of my knee.
I'm only seventeen and i'm scared, i know if i've damaged it i'll need surgery and then i'll have to be in a cast for 6 weeks or more and then start an incredibly long recovery process, i'm worried i'm going to be stuck with a limp for the rest of my life or suffer with pain when i walk like i am currently, i also don't fancy having to spend my eighteenth birthday wearing a cast or recovering in hospital.
Over the last eighteen months i've had a never ending cycle or problems and i just don't seem to be getting a break from anything and it's running me down, not to mention i now can't ride my motorcycle which is something i would do to releave myself if i was stressed or needed to get out for a little bit, that's the reason i am more worried about this than most people would be, i've never had surgery or anything before so i'm very very scared about it all.
If anybody has expierienced this can i just have some advice please?
Is the surgery safe? What are the risks? How long will i be in a cast afterwards? How long do i need to stay in hospital? And more importantly, how long will i have to spend in physio and whatnot trying to recover from it?
Thank you for any replies, i really do appreciate it

"It kind of ocurred to me the other day, I've seen lots of comments about the knee being 'heavy' and like concrete, and hard, and lots of other adjectives.
Maybe it's because that's exactly what it is...HEAVY....
Prior to my operation, the sister on the ward explained everything and had an example of the new joint (exactly as would be used to replace my knee)....Which she gave me to have a good look at and sort of 'play' with for a few minutes....I remember thinking at the time...""Jeeees...that's one hell of a lump of metal""...And it was...it was very heavy!
Now I'm no expert on the structure of bones, but I'm pretty sure the bones in our body are fairly light structures, although 'generally' incredibly strong, and it seems to me that the knee replacements are nothing like as light.
I'm wondering if that's why most contributors to this forum refer to their knee as feeling 'heavy'...etc.....Maybe that's because that's exactly what the new knee is...HEAVY!!!!
Any thoughts?

"Hi all. I just wondered how many of you are swimming? I am lucky enough to have a pool on my complex and have now started to swim daily, I'm sure it;s helping my muscles get back into shape and I can exercise better in the water. The five minute walk to get there doesn;t hurt either (well it does a bit). The thing is that it seems to be helping me mentally as well. I feel ready for anything when I come out. Can certainly recommend it. Carol, 8 weeks tomorrow. Wow 8 weeks!

"Hi
I Had ACL done about 10 years ago using the hamstring as a graft and all went well, then 18 months later had tiba screw removed as it was protruding and causing discomfort.
Between there and now have had 3 mensial cartlidge ops done all on the same knee, saw my GP last Oct regarding  pain when i walk too far or if i am on my feet too long, also knee have given way several time, and i get a grinding pain going up and down stairs aldo loud crack sound in knee coming down stairs.
The MRI showed no evidence of meniscal pathology but a strong suspicion of a full thickness tear to the mid ACL graft and medial patellofemoral articular cartilage degeneration as well as some changes on the lateral femoral condyle.
She struggles with the knee giving way and constant anterior knee discomfort.
Clinically there is mild effusion on the left side i have have a irritable patellofemoral joint with positive Clarke's test.
No tenderness over the joint lines and she has got a mildly positive Lachman's test.
Collateral ligaments were intact and there is no distal neurovascular deficit.
He explained that whilst there is a strong possibility that my ACL reconstruction may have ruptured he feels that it was more likely that my symptoms where originating from a degenerate patellofemoral joint.
He also stated that the main stay of treatment is going to be pain control and physiotherapy including some ACL rehab.
He has refereed me to physio which i am now doing and waiting for an appointment to see a pain doctor!
If i am on my feet too long or walk too far then i get swelling below the knee cap and the pain is a awful!
Just wonering if anyone else has had this please much appreciate your input as i felt as if i was taking up his time, but i just feel i have no quality of life at the moment and starting to feel depressed with it all!

"i saw the Consultant on Monday, I thought to start the proces for the first knee replacement but it's not that simple! It was arranged through NHS Choices and if I was paying I would have chosen him as he is very nice extremely well  qualified. However I am 59, can walk reasonable distance (eg to the shops) even though it hurts, no significant pain when resting but difficulty with stairs and getting up from chairs etc. An arthroscopy four years ago showed a lot of problems leading to me be told I would need the joints replacing in both knees and he acknowledges this is probably worse now than then. He advised me that a new joint would have a life expectancy of only 12 to 15 years which would mean it is likely I would have to have it done again(!!!) Any replacement would likely be less successful and more problematic.  He said TKR in younger patients (me!) is often not as successful as in older ones as there is a greater expectancy to be able do more and this can lead to disappointment in the outcome. 
He he explained that the easy option for him is just to do the surgery but that may not be the best option for me. He wanted to get up to date X-rays and to see me again to discuss everything.
I was initially disappointed as I had built myself up to having the operation and was armed with a whole list of questions about aftercare, dates etc but realise the wisdom of his words. I think I was thinking if it needs doing just get it done and work hard and get over it but if I would have to go through it all again....!!!!
Xrays (lots of theme) were done yesterday and I have an appointment to see him on 10 November which is the next date he is at that hospital. 
I cannot not stress how impressed I have been with NHS Choices and how quickly everything has been arranged.
So.....any advice from the voices of experience on this forum!!
Many thanks for wading through all my waffle and probable mistakes with predictive text.

"Hi to all of my wonderful new friends on this most excellent foram site. Just want to share my joyous experience with you. On Saturday I was my granddaughters wedding day, I hadn't had too bad a week but obviously was a little apprehensive as to how the new knee would fare. I need not have worried at 8o clock had breakfast of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs following this I had a 15min walk round the beautiful gardens in perfect weather. I then went to my room, showered ond put on my glad rags and my beautiful red and black fascinated, then it was into the bar for my first gin and tonic of the day. The wedding was magical and I felt really good and back to my old self..on to the evening where I Laughed, drank, sang and most importantly danced. Finally went to bed around 2oclock. Throughout the the i did not have use a stick or ask for any help or assistance.   How good was that 82 and just 11weeks post op. I felt so joyous Rachael was a dream bride and I felt privaliged to have such a wonderful family. Hope I haven't bored you stiff with this blog, but after the emmence trauma of the the past 11 weeks it felt right to share this you all. The support I have had from this forum has been so very good.

"Hello All
I am10 weeks post op, my bend is getting better (100 or maybe a little over)-I may need manipulation; my straightening is good when lying down but still not 100%when standing; my walk is getting better and I use one crutch or none inside but two when I go out.
Have just bought an automatic car this morning which will hopefully arrive by the weekend so I can drive again and get back to work part time as of next week.
So everything is progressing however my knee still feels very heavy and tight and is driving me more than mad as it feels like it is being literally crushed in a vice from either side of my knee /like the knee cap is being suctioned!
My GP has prescribed anti depressants to help me cope with it and she tells me it is the healing process in action but at my review four weeks ago I was told it was nerve pain. I have looked up nerve pain and what I feel does not tally.
I have mentioned this before and I know that lots of you have stiff or tight knees but has or is anyone else getting this feeling please and what has helped?
I do my exercises including the bike, I use a water bottles, elevation and small walks but nothing helps it.
Any advice would so appreciated, thanks, Tracey

"Spent an hour and a quarter with my surgeon this afternoon - who, on a side note had an emergency appendicitis operation on saturday and was back in his practice on monday!! - and we came to the conclusion that i have to go back into hospital on november 4. my bend at 6 weeks is 80 and has not improved in the past 3 weeks. nothing, zilch, nada. in his experience if you do not get this bend in the first week or two, you will never get up to 120 or 140. and at 51 i am very young to live with such a limited knee bend. so neither of us really see any option.
for those of you in the same situation: i will go in and they will put me under for a 10 minutes. during this time they will gently bend the knee. i will also get a pain catheter for 48 hours and during this time i will be on the knee bendy machine the whole time, day and night. i then come off the pain catheter and i have to continue for another 24 hours on the bendy machine relying on oral medication. as you can imagine, i then need to be stringent and rigorous with my exercises and will go to physio 3 times a week.
there are no guarantees that this will get my bend back but if i didn't do it, i would regret to taking the chance for the rest of my life. 80 is just rubbish so i am thinking optimistic
in the meantime he has given me different pain meds to see if i can stomach them so we know what works post op, incl. one with codeine. i am also getting lyrica which should be interesting as i have read lots about it on here. not sure how this will help but happy to try anything at this point.
that's the news. came out feeling tearful despite knowing what the outcome would be in my heart of hearts. i will post an update once i have had it and let you know if the whole thing was worth it.

"Ok, I'm 76 and at 57 my right knee first started to creek and sent me to an ortho doctor to find some answers....he said the start of OA....I wasn't in horrible pain etc, just the creeking....I went on to keep working out at my gym and wore a knee support....I probably went to the gym into my mid 60's....did NOT work out fanatically, gently and did a lot of mat stretches.... I still walked good.
Then at 70, groin pain hit me, waking me up at night in pain at the right groin.So went to ortho surgeon, I wasn't sure what the issue was: knee, lower back or hip.....saw the hip xrays and then believed it was hip. That visit was in August 2010.
Then in Oct 2010 I did the hip replacement, no 2nd opinions etc...
Surgery and recovery went well, then into 5th month things went downhill....spinal stenosis set in, right knee got worse, foot/ankle go worse -- the latter 2 with OA.
I believe all this downhill mess was due to shorter leg after replacement....this caused knee and foot/ankle to go whacky, pressure and tension from being so out of alignment.
Now, did you all deal with pain all the time, sitting, sleeping, walking?
My knee starts to pain after I've walked a little bit, not a lot but a little walking....otherwise no pain...I can bend knee with no problem, stiffness YES but I work it out.
I ride my recumbent bike without pain to the knee, want to keep it moving and a little cardio too.
I guess I'm just wondering how bad my knee is and I'm not up to going to an ortho doc to find out now.I've done that over years for various injections, acupuncture, mesotherapy and now doing glucosamine and ligaplex II every day......Trying all I can to do no knee surgery.
Prolozone for the knee is still in my mind.
I'd love to hear how painful it was for you to do the replacements....thanks J

With mine I had a scan first to make a model of the knee and to get the correct aligment and cutting jig etc would be interested in other patients views.

"I am going back to my surgeon on Wednesday and getting prepared for the meeting. As I fear I will be quite tearful when asked ""and how are you"" (I arrived at the office this morning in tears) I want to have a list at the ready with all the points to be discussed so we keep it very factual.
The elephant in the room is having to have my knee bent under anesthetic as the bend is still only at 80 after 6 weeks. So with this we will also have to discuss pain medication.
I cannot take any opiates (pethidine, tramadol or whatever they are called in the UK) and the pain meds I am on are a bit hit and miss or have stopped working really. But after the manual bend, I am pretty sure I will be in lots of pain again so my question to you all out there: which (strong) pain meds have you received which you can recommend so I can discuss with my surgeon if we have an equivalent over here??
Your feedback would be SUUUUUPER appreciated. Thanks so much!

"Glucosamine over your years of knee OA?I have off and on but am more ON now, some experts say it takes a good 2+ months to get into the joints to work.....this is not just taking off and on.....staying on.
My friend and I are getting into this supplement more as her Younger knee is bothering her and mine is an older knee and want to keep walking...
A friend who is 93 and runs circles around me at 76, has taken glucosamine daily for years....and she walks all over town and I envy her so much for her ability to walk good. She's not without some pains believe me, but 93!!!!
There is vegetarian glucoscamine for those who don't want the shellfish based products.
As I've said my knee issue is so worse since hip replacememt complications: shorter leg and more issues like nerve damage and IT band damage....

"Hello ... Have posted ad nauseam about the awful nights ... Last night, day 17 was as bad as alll the others and just pushed me over the edge. I had to go into hospital today to have a nerve root block to help the buttock and leg pain which have flared up since the knee replacement ... I had a three level lumbar fusion four months ago, I was warned a flare up could happen because of the angle of the leg during the op and the leg elevation in general. Back surgeon says it is more common in hip and knee replacements when you have had more than one level fused.  I ended up with two nerve blocks, a deep muscular steroid and an antibiotic. For the first time the sedation was not nearly enough and although they increased it, it was a very unpleasant experience. My back surgeon is great .. He sent me home with some Valium and said TAKE IT! GP very against it, but my BP was unusually high and he could see I am exhausted .. Grey, not really eating much (unheard of for me) and when he came in I started crying about everything. I am not give. To tears and have battled the bad back for years and consider myself fairly brave .. Said I just felt totally overwhelmed and back where I started straight after the fusion ... The first six weeks of that were devastating and this , though a bit more localised pain, is as bad becUse I am sleeping so little. I cannot believe I will ever get back to normality as I have barely bee able to function a normal life for so long now. Sorry to winge... Am so bashed and bruised from the leg, my back has bruised from the jabs, tummy from Heparin and I ache all over from exhaustion. Tomorrow ...... Please be better!

"I am a relative newby on this site which I am following as I am looking to start this process off. I follow a lot of discussions and am doing a lot of research including last night watching a video of an actual operation!! 
I am 59 and have had osteoarthritis for a number of years gradually worsening. I struggle with stairs(moved to a flat 4 years ago) had to change from a bath to a shower and find standing up from a sitting position difficult. Kneeling has been impossible for a number of years....even just walking sone days....!! I'm sure you all know the problems! I had an arthroscopy a few years ago and the orthopaedic surgeon said I needed new knees but as I was only early 50's then to put it off as long as possible. Steroid injections only last about 2 weeks. I read that NICE now recommends that knees are replaced before they get too bad as this can cause more problems after surgery so I am seeing my GP on Friday to ask for a referral to request TKR.
i feel I am preparing myself and making a note of all hints and tips from this site together with medications, icing, massage, Physio etc.
What I am wondering is what others did before their operation? Did they look at this forum? Did it change their mind??!! I obviously hasn't changed mine - yet! 
I find it hugely helpful and inspirational reading all the posts both positive and negative and thank everyone for sharing their experiences.

"Hello from Switzerland!  I am new to this forum but am desperately looking for answers to my dilemma and there seems to be a great support network here.  I had a complete knee replacement 18 days ago and my knee feels like a block of wood which is stopping me from getting the required degrees of ""bendage"".  On the machine I can get up to 80° without cheating :-) and on my own about 70°.  My doctors are not happy with me at all and are threatening to put me back on the operating table to bend the knee under anasthesia.  When I first heard that, I nearly passed out.  They reckon if you cannot bend it at least 90° in the first 3 weeks, it will never get right.  I don't know who to believe as my therapists all tell me not to go down that rather drastic route. Does anybody have experience with this?  Or any tips on how to make the muscles relax?  Am rubbing in all kinds of potions from Tiger Balm to Deep Heat ...
By the sounds of things, the docs in the UK don't put their patients under as much pressure as here.  And you all get well anyway so I am wondering if I should just ignore them?  Though I do understand their argument that I am too young (51) not to be able to bend my knee at 120°.  Perhaps I just need more time?

I have excruciating pain, pain pills do not ease the pain (oxycodone, panadol, nurofen zavance, aspirin). 
I have trouble walking, bearing weight on the knee, and the pain is always worse at night. Pain is dull and aching in nature with severe onset of stabbing pain. 
And no, I have never injured my knee.

"Hi there I had a TKR 17 days ago and all was going well until day 8 when I had acute excruciating pain in my new knee joint. Went to A & E and they diagnosed a bleed into the new joint. They said the cause was the fact that the anti dvt tablets were working too well. The consultant said rest it for a while but it's now 9 days later and I still have swelling and can't bend my leg much at all. Before the bleed I was progressing well with a 70 degree bend but now without being able to do the bending physio I'm worried that I won't get the range of movement that I should have. Has anyone experienced a bleed similar to mine and how long was it before you could properly do all the exercises again? Thanks Mike

"Im 22 years old, and as the title says I was playing football about 5 days ago, when suddenly while I was running towards the ball I heard a pop in my knee and suddenly i fell to the ground in pain. I never experienced pain like this in my life, my knee immediately started to swell, and I couldnt put any weight on it. One of my teammates got me a bag of ice, and i rested for about 15 min, then drove home. OnceI got home I googled what I should do, and continued with the RICE method (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevate). The next day I walked on crutches, and the day after that took it easy. 5 days later, now I biked to school which is a 3 mil hike, and my knee felt good, there was still some discomfort, but the pain is gone and i can bend the knee. I live in the U.S. and I cant afford medical insurance, and I would just like to know if this is a minor sprain or an ACL tear?

"Hi, could you lovely people advise me how long you used your crutches for?
I am 6 weeks post op and I am happily on the mend!
I never used my crutches around the house on my return from hospital, mainly because I only have a little house, I think I would have been more at risk of using them indoors!!
whenever I have been out since I have used my  crutches, but using them less and less now.
however I have found when doing a shop at the local supermarket by the time I get to the checkout, I feel exhausted and in pain again?
I don't know if I should still be using them?
I have another week to go before I have my post op consultation with the hospital, obviously I will ask their advice when I go?
but I just wondered if you could share with me when you felt ready to part with the crutches?
Thanks

"I know sleep problems are a problem for many people .... I am only 11 days post op. The awful bruising is getting better, the heat is marginally better at times, the tightness is slightly better in the thigh .. I can press it a little now  but of course the tightness around the knee is there all the time, sometimes bad enough and sometimes excruciating!  I am persevering with the exercises ... Leg lift very good, heel slides pretty good but not quite level with the other knee yet. I try to do it in two stages .. Take it slowly as far as I ca, wait a half a minute with the knee where I got it to and the try for a couple more degrees . Weight bearing and walking generally fine and stairs tiring but fine.
SLEEP ... On average I wake three times between first falling asleep and 4am ... It is now 03.30 and this is the third wake up since 11.00. For the first time tonight I woke with a really viscous headache as well .. Am taking OxyContin 5mg am, Panadol 4 times a day, OxyContin 5mg nightly which doctor upped to 10mg at night to see of that helped sleeping. I also have OxyNorm for breakthrough. Tonight I haven't taken the OxyNorm because of the bad headache .. Thought it might make it worse ... I walk around the bedroom when I  wake up, ice the knee, gently massage the bits I can and pray for the extreme tenderness down my shin to start improving. Last night (Wednesday night ) in sheer misery and frustration magazines got hurled across the Roo. And tears of self pity were shed and my poor husband who is fantastic to me got the worst of it!
During the day I shower etc, walk around whichever room I am in, eat downstairs, watch some tv downstairs in the evening with leg raised but during the day I only want to be on the bed as it is the best place to stretch out comfortably and also do the heel slides etc. I got a wheelchair from the Red Cross and as yesterday was so lovely, got dressed and my husband took me out for a breath of air. Disaster.  Leg down hurt the knee where it went over the seat edge and up in front of me in the raised foot plate jarred my back too much ... More pain and misery.
 As in previous postings my other big problem is that I had a three level lumbar fusion only seven months ago and the op and being on my back ( cannot lay on my side because of knee 'heaviness' ) sitting with my leg elevated even about 6 or 7 inches puts a lot of pressure on my back and I have had horrible nerve flare up and next Friday will go back on for my back surgeon to give me another nerve block which I pray helps as the back pain is nasty. I also have a lot of hip pain I haven't had before and I use the heat pad against it for a bit of comfort.
One online YouTube ortho, film suggested heated towel before exercises followed by ice afterwards ... Anybody doing that? Does it help get a bit more movement?
I would like to know what medication routine is working for a few other people .. Perhaps ditching the OxyContin under supervision and going for something else .. I am badly allergic to Oramorph so cannot take that .
Any sleep suggestions gratefully relieved ....

"Before I left hospital, I had a word with my nurse about using my TENS machine to help after discharge. I asked because it says not to be used with implanted devices and, of course, I have a large lump of metal where there used to be bone.
she was good enough to go talk with my surgeon and he said there was no problem doing this but the jury is still out whether it helps or not.
well, I have been using it for the past week as part of my support stuff and, alongside pain relief, icing and exercise, I think it does help.
purely subjective of course but maybe worth a try?
the unit I'm using comes from lloyds pharmacy, here in the uk and it is their dual channel one. It has different programs for different areas of the body and there is a special one for knees. It cost about 15 GBP if I remember right.

"Hello ... This is my first posting to the Forum.  I am having a TKR on my right knee on Monday due to severe osteoarthritis ... No cartilage left.  I am not nervous about going into theatre for the op. Itself, more the pain and tiredness and being stuck at home etc. I had a three level lumbar fusion back in February this year .... Not what I would call a recreational experience! I would like to black out the first couple of months after it from my memory. I have fused really well and 85% of my leg nerve pain is now well reduced and under control. It is only now that both the back and knee surgeons are allowing me to go ahead with the knee .... After all, why have such a major op. on my back to be held back by the knee?  I can hardly walk now and am putting severe strain on my 'good' knee and all this does not help my back recovery which depends on a walking. I have been waiting for the go-ahead but now nerves are setting in and I am dreading the pain, tiredness,swelling and lack of mobility and independence again just as I am finally able to do a bit more. It is making me feel tearful and depressed though I know the eventual outcome should be very good.
i have been warned that the knee will be no picnic and my courage is beginning to fail.  I am lucky that my husband has been amazing and will be again, I have a lovely surgeon and an excellent, supportive GP, good kids, three adorable small grandchildren who will now have to take a backseat again and friends. I am only 59 ... Lucky that I don't have an illness that is life threatening but I am having  a real wobble. All encouragement and tips would be appreciated.

What worries me is I still get stiffness and pain in muscles at the back of leg, thigh down to calf on outside of knee and also some at inner knee. My consultant told me this is because I'd been walking wrongly for so long before op when I was unable to straighten my leg that they will take time to readjust. I just wonder how long this will take? Do I need to get the leg completely straight before the muscles will loosen up? I wondered if anyone who is 3/6 months or more post op who could tell me of their experiences. I know everyone is different but any encouragement or advice would be welcome. Thanks.

"Hi all ,first time poster.
11 days ago I had what looks like a common experience.  Footy game, 2 players going for the same ball, both hit it at the same.  I hit it with my right foot side on and the knee gave way.  Rolled around in pain for a while, somehow drove home and it wasn't until the next morning that I went to A&E after a very uncomfortable night.
First thought was of course knee ligaments, all A&E could do was x-ray it (which was clear), give me crutches and refer me to Orthapedics.
It swelled up but I was only really in pain when I knocked it the wrong way or attempted stairs.  I could hobble around ok but it wasn't comfortable. GP signed me off for a few weeks tellng me to keep it rested, iced, elevate etc.  So I'm going stir crazy at home and keen to return to work.
I've not heard back with an appointment yet but I'm expecting a long wait for an initial outpatient appointment.  I assume they will want an MRI scan done but meanwhile I really want to know when I can expect to see any improvement and be sure of what I can safely do without inflicting more damage.
The main issue is the lack of ability to bend the knee beyond a very small distance before it becomes painful.  Pain confined principally to the lower left side where the swelling is/was.  It's also painful to try to fully straighten it. Lifting the leg of the ground and moving the lower leg gently from side to side results in a knocking where the pain is coming from.

This is limiting my enjoyment of life as I cannot walk round an exhibition,or even round more than one shop at a time.

I've had a couple of occasions that has really shaken my confidence and now I feel increasingly anxious about going outside and walking. I have got so low over recent weeks my GP suggested antidepressants which I have now discontinued because of the horrendous side effects. I often feel light headed when walking which adds to the feelings  of being unsafe and that any minute I could fall. Is anybody else experiencing anything like this?

"Hi 
I am not looking for a magic fix just somewhere I can vent and others will understand.
In oct 2013 I had my first knee op, a growth was removed, my knee cap realigned as it was dislocated due to the growth. My fat pad removed along with some cartilage, my tendons above the knee shaved down and the membrane fully removed above the knee. Some work on my collateral ligament also (think that's the right name) 
Anyway prior to this I was v fit and active. Training up to 6 times a week until the Pain made me slow down. I hoped the op would help me return to training but after a very long 6 month recovery I started presenting more problems.

I am increasing my walks well but still plagued with frustration. I am only 30 and feel like a huge stop button has been put on a important part of my personal self. Does that sound dramatic? I feel like  a complete pain saying this to anyone else as the growth could have been something much more serious and others have larger problems than not been able to run again!!! 
Everything takes ages, housework and I have been off work for a eternity now. It's effecting my children and my poor husband who's been v supportive but I know I must be driving him mad too.

"This is tucks again, went for my first physio yesterday , I knee bend good a 97but need to work a bit more on straightening the knee. Problem is it is still very swollen and stiff. Gave me different set of excersises. Least night after my usual fidgeting about for a couple oh hours, thought about my hot water bottle , what a joy placed it just below my feet not touching. The warmth just enveloped me and with a pillow between my legs I dropped off to Sleep for 4hours.the niggly pains started again so I went downstairs and made myself a cup of tea. This relaxed me and I managed another 3good hours.. Seems so trivial but maybe warmth is a key to comfort.. I shall certainly be giving it a try again tonight. Thanks for your time friends. Just being able to talk about things is a great comfort. Take care. Tucks

"It occured to me the other day, there are some amusing things about having the total knee replacement done.  Yes I know it hurts, and there have been occasions when I've regretted having it done, along with endless sleepless nights.  But I do quite often smile to myself.  Does anyone else have things they find funny, or have I just got a warped sense of humour?
1: Putting underpants / Knickers on.  I find myself dangling them down towards my foot (on the operated leg) trying to lassoo my foot with them and of course get it in the right hole.  Many is the time, I've managed to get the foot into the wrong hole!
2: I take a smallish cushion to bed with me, so that I can either put it under my knee, if I'm lying on my back, or if I'm lying on my side, between my knees, as I find one knee laying on top of another is too heavy and hurts.  I've become so expert in using it now, as I change position in the night, I can move it about and into the right place without thinking about it.  It's become almost like a childs comfort blanket!!!
Click here to view image
4: I find myself doing my exercises out in public, just to see the expression on peoples faces as they pass by...Have I turned into an exhibitionist?
5: I keep 'tapping' the outside of my knee (which since the op has gone numb) just to see if the feeling has suddenly come back!
6: When I'm standing (making a cuppa or something) I find myself slouching to one side, and putting my body weight on the 'good' leg, then realise and tell myself off for not standing 'properly'.
I'm sure I can think of many other instances, and I'm sure others can too.  But the things listed above, do make 'me' smile.  Am I bit weird?  Is it 'just' me?

"Hello everyone I just thought it might be helpful for some of you who are at the start of this long jouney back to fitness to share some of my experiences. Hope it helps.
When I first came out of hospital I thought the pain was tremendous and over the first few weeks wondered why I had gone through this. I was very weepy and tired all day long. Some days I had to really push myself to do anything let alone excercise. By week three although still in pain the intensity lessened and I was able to do more. I think this spurred me on. Once I had hit the six week mark I now could drive and went in my car with glee. Must admit it was very painful braking but oh the joy of getting out under ones own steam without having to rely on people.
There have been good days and bad days but have had to be patient.
I am now at week 18 and realise that I am not continually thinking about my knee. My life is nearly back to normal. So ther is light at the end of the tunnel.
I am due to have my other knee done in October. I have kept a weekly journel so I will know where I am up to.
Hope this helps people because I hasve been helped so much on here and wanted to give something back.

"Almost eight weeks after TKR, I am still in a great deal of pain. Not so much in the knee, but defferred pain in my entire leg, worst in calf, shin and ankle. I did really well, never needed to use sticks or crutches from day one, did all the exercise without much problem,,,, but, from the second week, my leg muscles went into spasm and I have been in agony since. I am not sleeping more than a maximum of three hours out of 24 and there is nowhere I am comfortable ! I am pacing around to aleviate the pain for between 20 and 22 hours a day..... Non of the pain relief prescribed has helped ( Paracetamol, Tramadol and Diazapam ) and I am just about demented with the lack of sleep more so than the pain ! At my six week check up, I was told that all was well, the only exercise I was told to do was to try and get my leg straighter as it is not quite as straight as the other one...... I am driving again, but would not be able to drive more than 40 miles without being in pain. None of the medical staff I have spoken to seem to be concerned about this, but I am just about at my wits end now. Is it just me ? I have a high pain threshold and have been told I may have "" overdone "" things from the beginning !!!!

"Good evening.
I have never been on a discussion forum like this before but thought I needed to get other peoples opinions as im in a bit of a state.
I'm a 27 year old male. Up until about 9 weeks ago I was a very athletic person who went running every night and went to the gym 2-3 times a week. I also played football for two football teams both saturday league and sunday league aswell as 5 a side football midweek.
9 weeks ago I was playing football in the biggest match of my career at the local football ground in the league cup final. - when I look back at this day (which was supposed to be full of brilliant memories) all I can say is ""Why on earth did I play that match?, I would have been fine now"".
We was around half way through the first half when there was a race on for ball between me and a player. I managed to get there first and then then it happened. My right leg seemed to just 'give way' as it landed. I heard a crack and straight away was in pain. At first I panicked as I thought that I may have twisted my knee and remember grabbing my leg and straightened it up. I was down for about 5 minutes before I ended up having to come off. I managed to walk off with a limp. - Luckily we won the game meaning I got a big trophy.
Anyway it progressively got worse over night and by the morning my leg had swollen up and I even had to call work in and have the day off sick. I tried walking to the living room and I had to quickly sit down as I was going to faint. - That was the worst of it.
As the days passed the pain slowly went and the bruising in my leg disappeared after two weeks or so. I was unable to run however and so have rested up over pre season hoping it will get better.
As the weeks went on my leg slowly felt as though it was getting better however I have developed a click in my knee now and also sometimes it doesn't feel as though it has straightened properly and then if I put a bit of pressure on it my knee would quickly straighten up and feel ok. I can fully straighten my knee now and without any issues but I cannot bend my knee all the way so my foot touched my bum. I get so far and it is agony. 
 Exactly 1 month ago I went to the doctors and he had a look at me and told me he was an 'expert' in sports injuries etc. He did a few tests and said it feels ok now and there doesn't seem to be any knee damage. He then decided that the left side of my knee needed draining. I agreed for him to drain it (which was pain free) and then he said come back in a month if it hadn't improved.
Also when I try to sit on my foot at the front of my knee I can feel some sort of lump. It feels like it's potentially another part of my knee that needs the fluid draining from. - See pic below. the fluid is where my finger is - you cannot see it when my leg is straight.
http://i580.photobucket.com/albums/ss247/NEO-BAHAMUT-/IMG_0448_zps4d63f205.jpg
I'm really worried about what is going to happen next if I go back. He mentioned that I could probably do with an MRI scan and perhaps a camera in my knee which doesn't fill me with the best of feelings.
I've never had an op or anything like that and don't really want to be put to sleep.
I was hoping someone on here could help or give me some sort of opinion as to what will happen next.
Thanks for reading.

"I had my pre-admission appointment and it has left me wondering if I am doing the correct thing by going ahead with this. The doctor says 1 in 3 are not happy with the result. Talked about loss of movement in knee which doesnt sound like progress. The inplant will be stainless steel. I have been reading online about titanium and all sorts of other space age sounding materials. This may have been in the States I guess but this stainless steel sounds old fashioned. The justification is that its tried and tested but that approach would have us still using leaches. I need both knees done but approach is only to do one intially. So I am facing 3 motnhs incapicitation, off work etc with the same thing to follow in the next couple of years. I was also told that as I am only 53 I will need to repeat the procedure later in life. Sorry - reading this back I sound like I am whinging. Does anyone know anyone who has been through this and it has improved things? Just the doc painted a pretty bleak picture.

"For the last year and a bit i have had this issue with my right knee. Ive seen my gp and 3 Physiotherapists. All 3 of which have given me different answers. 
My problem:
For one when i squat up and down it clicks but only when my hip is bent. For example a squat it clicks but standing on one leg and flexing it. Nothing.
When running i get a pushing, hot pain as if someone is jamming their thumb into my joint. One physio gave me blue insoles to which showed very little effect. The second one said my legs were not aligned so it caused uneven wear and the 3rd gave me a hip and spine reallignment which i thought worked but after a short run. It was back. He thought it may be Lica or some ligament damage. 
Does anyone have a similair story or problem? I cannot get an MRI or surgery as i am in training for the Royal Navy and need to see what i can do to help this. If insoles that are soft and shock absorbing help? ANYTHING Please help this is desperate. Thank you in advance

"I am 3 weeks post op. Stayed awake during the TKR , and had no problems with that .discharged after 3 nights . Really bad pain for the first 12 days .not only in the the right operated knee but in the left awaiting knee. Not even morphine would touch it. Stockings to wear for 6 weeks and in this heat not nice, but I am still wearing them. Really bad allergic reaction to we think the blood thinner drugs , covered, and I mean covered pictures to prove it lol in great hives and spots that itched so badly I changed to blood thinning injections that I still have to use for  another  week , to help prevent blood clots .the allergy took a week to clear and left me exhausted. At that point the thought of a second knee op , went straight out of the window lol. 
Now the good stuff , I started exercises before my op, and carried them on daily even through the pain . my bend is 105 and my straight is 8, I find straightening hardest . Yesterday I managed a flight of stairs walking like an adult !! It wasn't easy and I couldn't come down the same .but I was so pleased , It must be. 2 years since I have managed that. I am 67  (whispered that ) I have to learn to walk with the crutches and tuck my bum in and keep my back straight as I tend to bend over , again a habit after such a long time in pain. So keep up the exercises, they really do help. We are off on a touring caravan holiday tomorrow , and really ready for it now .

"I had total knee replacement 10 days ago and everyone has told me to always keep my affected leg straight and elevated whenever I'm lying down, so I assumed that meant all night too. I was also told never to put a towel or pillow under my knee as that could form blood clots, so I lie there with a towel or pillow under my ankle or calf with the rest of my leg ""dangling"" and is very uncomfortable. 
Did I misunderstand? I've also tried lying on my good side with a pillow between my knees, but I'm still scared to death to bend my affected leg for fear it will not heal properly.

"Hi suffered damage to my left knee playing football  in March this year. I was off work for ten weeks took approx 6 weeks for the swelling in my knee to go down then another  4 weeks of physio , trying to improve movement and being able to walk without to much pain during or after. I had an MRI which showed I had torn my meniscus, completely torn my ACL and had a grade 2 sprain in my PCL although another doctor said it was a partial tear. I Am waiting to go in for an operation in 4 weeks to repair/tidy up the meniscus and they are going to put a camera in to assess the rest of my knee. The problem is I am really starting to struggle particularly after walking doesn't matter how far or fast I walk, five minutes after I stop my legs are gone. I am also starting to get a lot of pain in my right knee could this just be because of the extra weight it's having to bear because my left knee is damaged? Will it go away after my left knee is repaired or could my right knee be getting damaged or worn?

"Hi. I have pain in my left knee all the time. I am 61 now and have had the pain for about 25 years, although then it didn't last as long.
When I was in my 40s I went for an MRI and the result was wear and tear - so no action, just put up with it!
Since then I have had x-rays on several occasions and each time the result is - wear and tear!
My knee is not swollen at all, and does not lock. I have pain on the inner side of kneecap, and sometimes a burning pain too. It is very painful to walk, and the ""limp"" I adopt causes pain in my hip.
The pain has been gradually getting worse over the last few months, and is now more or less constant.  It keeps me awake at night, and no amount of ibuprofin or paracetamol, or Voltarol helps.
This morning I went to my GP, who has told me that I'm too young for a knee replacement as they only last 10 years. She has arranged for me to have a steroid injection.
Can anyone give me advice?
She actually asked me if I wanted a knee replacement, and said she would refer me, but I thought I would explore any other avenies first.

I have bought one pair of thigh high stockings and although better are still not comfortable and cut in around the top, although I measured carefully .Has anyone tried the stockings wuth waist attachment ( I don't fancy tights) . These are expensive but if they are comfy it will be worth it . Any advice please?

" woke up Wednesday morning with a really sharp pain behind both my knees which hurt to bend. Behind both knees there was a swollen area which felt like they were full of fluid. There was no bruising and no real redness. I don't suffer from arthritis and now 3 days on my right leg has returned to normal but my left is still slightly swollen. 
Does anyone know what could've caused this? I haven't felt ill or had any other symptoms. 
I was drinking the night before along with boiling hot weather and a fair bit of walking but found it strange that behind my knees swelled on both legs. 
Please help! 
Thank you

"It's been going on for around a year now, I'm a 19 year old male, I never do any sports, so it can't be a tear.
Symptoms:
- Locking when leg is rotated (full flection at 140deg)
- Knee pain when walking on
- First time gave way few week ago
Timeline:
- Went to see GP, referred for X-Ray.
- No results on X-Ray.
- Reffered to consultant who referred me for MRI.
- Nothing on MRI.
- Started Physio for 3 months (Jan), slight help, not much better.
- Consultant review said not confident doing arthroscopy as low chances or diagnosis / could cause compliations later.
Next:
- Consultant doesn't know where to go next and sent me for more physio which I attended once to find that I need to do calf excercies, so I never went back... (The physio dude seemed clueless)

My big problem is that I am becoming very anxious and depressed ( I have always loved walking on the downs on my doorstep & the thought of this all being taken away is making me feel seriously depressed) I am really looking for people to tell me about their positive outcomes and I wondered if there was anybody out there who would be happy to recount and share their experiences ...

"Had 3 TKR's in just over 4 years, 2 on the left & 1 on the right & I'm now looking at possibly having them both done again due to instability & ongoing pain, I've also had the poly liners changed in both joints to try & make the joints more stable but unfortunately this hasn't helped.I also had the patella resurfaced on the right knee which made no difference at all, so in just under 4 years I've had 7 major surgeries on both joints & have now been told I need bilateral hip replacements before I may have to have my knees done again, it been explained to me that I have somehow managed to stretch out the joints (must be stronger than I thought?) has anybody else experienced this kind of problem after having knee replacements?

"I have just been diagnosed with a burst bakers cyst. I have had pain in the back of my knee for about 4 months which became increasingly painful to the point where I was limping and using knee support. On going upstairs I was suddenly in acute pain - it felt as if 2 rubber bands had twanged in the back of my knee - and I could not move. My whole leg was very swollen. Xray showed no knee damage and I was given a knee splint. I then developed a DVT (shown on a doppler). My knee is very much better and I can walk, drive, cycle and go up and down stairs but I still experience a lot of discomfort in the back of my knee, a tight feeling on straightening the leg and general tenderness. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms?

"Hi I am 13 weeks post op. I visited my consultant 4 weeks ago for a check up and told him that my leg would not lie straight. He told me to push it down and keep doing this. I am due to see him again in 4 weeks time. I dont seem to be getting any nearer to straightening this leg. The pain is nearly gone now and I am walking a lot better but soon get tired especailly after standing. I am going on holiday in September and am worried that I might have to use a stick if I am going to be waiting about at airport etc.Does anyone have any idea how long it takes for the leg to completety straighten like the other one?

"Hi,
I was diagnosed with chondromalacia in the patella when I was 15 which my GP told me was due to doing a lot of gymnastics for a long period of time and i should reduce the level of activity that puts huge amounts of strain on my knees.
That was 5 years ago and now I have recently gone back to quite high levels of training as I thought my knees were much better. After a long run, my right knee became very painful and cracks and the GP has said it could be a meniscus tear but he wants to wait until the inflammation goes down before re-examining it and taking further action. But he said the most likely course of treatment would be surgery as I've already had physio.
I was just wondering if anybody else has had a meniscus tear that has been repaired surgically. If so, how does it work after seeing the GP? I know it's a silly question but I'd quite like to know how long the process takes, I don't want to be out of training for too long! Will the GP order scans and then refer to the hospital if sugery is necessary or will I be refered before the scans are done? Also, how long have people had to wait between being diagnosed with a meniscus tear and having surgery?
Thanks

"This whole procedure has really been traumatic for me and I didn't expect it.
constipated, feeling sick, so tired I can't even think straight and absolutely no appetite.
I adore my grandchildren, but am shocked that I don't even want to see them.
My knee is so stiff.  Using ice packs every two hours for 10 mins, but then I feel shaky and cold.
What a misery I am.  Desperate to know it gets better.

"Hello!
Recently, following painful locking episodes,  I was dignosed with a very bad knee
1.  Grossly abnormal PCL, cystic change, marrow oedema, longstanding tear
2. Grade 4 chondromalacia patella affecting medial facet
3. Tri compartmental OA
4. Intra articular loose bodies
My dr referred me to a specialist who said preferred option is do nothing, unless I die beforehand of something else I will need a knee replacement. (!)
Since I have no confidence in my knee at all, is this a reasonable course of action and, was his attitude towards me acceptable.

"I had a total knee replacement 3 weeks ago and after 2 weeks the intense pain subsided and I can now control the pain relatively easily. My problem arises with the exercises! I can straighten , am fairly mobile, can walk albeit with a bit of a limp but find bending beyond about 85/90 degrees excruciating. I can describe as a pain akin to being stabbed although I've never been stabbed. My physio tells me I need to push through the pain which I understand as have done so on many occasions in the past but this, I feel is different otherwise why can't I do what it seems is a normal expectation. So I went to the GP for a pain management chat. When I mentioned the stabbing pain and a burning pain sometime during the night he was concerned enough to perscribe medication for nerve damage as they do cut through the nerve. I've been on this new meds for 2 days and am beginning to feel more confident as I think I am bending beyond 90 degrees already. I'm hopeful this is the answer as I really want to do it right. My question is, has anyone else experienced the same problem after knee replacement?

"I've had a problem with my right knee for around 11 years now, I am only 22 years old so the trouble started when I was 11, when I fell and injured it. It is extremely swollen and painful. The doctors have tried draining the fluid several times and had no luck. I have had multiple MRI scans and they can't see any problems. Have been referred between the Orthopedics and Rhuemertologists. The first Rhuemertologist said it was Rheumatoid Arthritis, the second said nope definitely not arthritis. They have now passed me back to Orthopedic again!! It just seems like they're passing me to each other because they don't know what the problem is. I have had one arthroscopy a year ago, and have just been put on the waiting list for another. Doctors have said that the fall when I was younger isn't related . They mentioned something called PVNS which doesn't seem to be very common so there isn't much information anywhere to learn about it - the second Orthopedic i saw has ruled out PVNS. If anyone has any ideas, or is in a similar situation would appreciate any help or information!?
