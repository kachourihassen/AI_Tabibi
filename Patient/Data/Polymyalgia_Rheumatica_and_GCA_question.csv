"Copied from Eileen's post in another discussion.
A group of us worked out reduction schemes individually that have allowed us to reduce far further than ever before but they are all basically the same - and they were based on a scheme a Swedish gentleman worked out when he simply couldn't get below 3mg without pain. Img at that level is 33%, 1/2mg is 17% - way above the 10% that has been recommended for years. So he used table to see the daily doses and took the new dose on one day, old dose for a few days and then proceeded by repeating that and then reducing the number of days of old dose - until he got to everyday new dose. It worked, he got off pred and has been off pred for at least 3 years (it could be longer). Something similar to mine is being tried by a consultant rheumatologist in the north of England and he too finds it works for every single patient he has given it to. As it did for several ladies beforehand.
My reductions are VERY slow. I use the following pattern to reduce each 1mg:
1 day new dose, 6 days old dose
1 day new dose, 5 days old dose
1 day new dose, 4 days old dose
1 day new dose, 3 days old dose
1 day new dose, 2 days old dose
1 day new dose, 1 day old dose
1 day old dose, 2 days new dose
1 day old dose, 3 days new dose
1 day old dose, 4 days new dose
1 day old dose, 5 days new dose
1 day old dose, 6 days new dose
By that stage if I feel OK I feel safe to go all new dose. I suppose you might be OK starting and stopping at ""1 day new, 4 days old"" but I was terribly sensitive to steroid withdrawal pain so I err on the safe side. Once you get to the ""everyday new dose"" - if you feel OK you can start on the next reduction, no real need to spend a month at the new dose.
This avoids steroid withdrawal pain - which is so similar to PMR pain that you often can't tell which is which and some of us suspect that many flares are NOT the PMR returning but problems with steroid withdrawal. Using a scheme like this also means you can stop immediately if you have any problems - you might be fine at one day old dose, 2 days new (lower) dose but not at a 3 day gap - but you have dropped your dose a lot and that is the idea. It also isn't as slow as you would think - you can reduce at a rate of about 1mg/month on a continual basis.
The Bristol group start new patients with PMR with 6 weeks 15mg, 6 weeks at 12.5mg and then a year at 10mg before continuing the reduction and that achieves a far lower rate of flare (20% instead of 60%) and I suspect their flares then come below 10mg as they then do the 1mg at a time reduction. Just below 10mg is a common dose for people to get stuck at - and I (and others) believe it is because even 10% drops are too much for many patients. These patients are then labelled as ""steroid resistant"" or told they need methotrexate to help them reduce but we have seen this slow reduction work for those patients too. We believe that methotrexate (MTX) works for patients who have late onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) or LORA and PMR together. Very few patients get off pred altogether when taking the MTX - those who do are probably the mis-diagnosed LORA patients - or another arthritis that responds to MTX.""
Further comment from Eileen in original discussion:
Can I add a codicil to the very slow reduction plan in the above post:
When you are at doses below 5mg it is a good idea to rest at each new dose for a month at least before trying the next reduction. At this point you risk overshooting the dose that is controlling the inflammation so waiting a short time to see if symptoms reappear is helpful. If you just continue there is a possibility that you get to very slightly below the ""right dose"" and inflammation will start to reappear very slowly. The blood tests will lag even further behind the dose reduction - there must be enough inflammation to increases the proteins being measured for the blood tests to rise.
Someone has asked this question:
""I'm at 7mg going down to 6mg, and I'm at the point where I'm starting to shift from more 6mg than 7mg, but I can tell the pain is returning. So...do I jump up big to say 10mg, or try 7mg or 8mg? I hate the very idea of going up at all, but it is what it is.""
My reply was:
No - you go back to the last dose that worked well immediately and stop the reduction. This isn't a ""flare"", this is your body telling you that you have got to the dose you are looking for: the LOWEST DOSE THAT MANAGES THE SYMPTOMS. It doesn't mean you won't get lower, it just means not yet. However slowly you reduce, whatever scheme you use, you will not get below that dose without a return of symptoms because of left-over inflammation that hasn't been removed by the amount of pred you took. It is if you ignore these warnings that you will allow a build-up of the inflammation to the stage where you will have a flare on your hands.
To comment on something someone else said - you have differentiated between steroid withdrawal and a return of symptoms by using DSNS. If you were going to suffer with steroid withdrawal you will notice it the first day you use the new lower dose. That is the idea of DSNS - you go back to the dose your body is happy at for a few days and then show the new dose to your body again. For me it usually takes about 3 times for my body to accept the new lower dose and stop complaining.

"Hi,  Haven't logged in in awhile.   About 5 weeks ago  I suddenly began to have real problems breathing.  Walk across a room and I am out of breath. Walk back and I am really out of breath.  I went to emergency and the diagnosis they gave me was absurd, grade 1 diastolic heart dysfunction- absurd is not just my opinion but the opinion of my primary and my pulmonary doctor and everything I read.  Also note, my CRP was 2.9, super high.   So was it the bird breeders lung disease which has been stable for 10 years (everyone wants to blame that one), or heart disease?  Neither according to my wizz bang pulmonary doctor, the one who diagnosed the bird lung disease 10 years ago, it was ""connective tissue disease"", inflammation that went to the lungs, in other words, the PMR which that clueless rheumatologist had been so reluctant to diagnose. I wonder if I had been properly treated for PMR from the beginning, would I have this problem now?  Anyway I am having another round of high dose prednisone, tapering fairly quickly, and I am being put on oxygen since I met the criteria for that:  She walked me 50 feet down the hall, my oxygen sat went down to 88%, and she stopped me right there- low enough for oxygen.  I just hope they can get it under control--then I might not have to lug oxygen around the rest of my life.
By the way, I feel fine if I am sitting or lying down.  It is just walking.
      I must say I have often thought I should fly across the pond to the U.K. for this PMR thing. You seem to have a much better handle on the disease than we do here.

"Good morning,
I was diagnosed with PMR in 2016 and have been on Prednisolone ever since. I've reduced from 40mg to 10mg in all that time. If I take anything lower than 10mg I get a flare.
Rheumatology have suggested that I take Metatresate (not sure of spelling), to help with reduction to get me off the steroids.
However, I've read that this is also a drug given to cancer patients.
Is anyone else on this drug to help reduction and have you had any side effects please ?

"Hello everyone and I hope you don't mind me doing a bit of research on you!
Someone recently posted on the American PMR forum that they had been diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3 (CKD3) and her GP told her it was caused by PMR.
I just wondered whether anyone else reading this has also been diagnosed with a lower kidney function.
The particular blood test called an eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) is apparently carried out on all of us having a routine blood test although we wouldn't be aware of it unless it comes back low and then we are usually informed. It is a relatively new test being done for the last 3+ years at the request of the Government who want to find out whether the decreased function is an ageing process or a disease process.
However, I have recently discovered that not all GPs are now informing their patients of low readings (a non-PMR friend of mine has discovered the result through reading some hospital papers!). My GP has recently informed me that now 3 years into the test they are discovering that over 1,000 people in his practice alone are producing variable readings!
I would be very interested to know whether any of you have been diagnosed with this condition where you have a reading of below 60 on your eGFR test. I am trying to find out if the condition can be PMR-related as when I was diagnosed with CKD3 it was at the end of my first year with undiagnosed PMR so therefore it wouldn't have been put down to this condition.
I'm sorry this has got a bit lengthy but thank you all for reading this far if you haven't all switched off with boredom or confusion :? !!!

"Ok so I feel like I've hit a brick wall with this and feel like I'm getting no where with my doctor so I need a little adivce. Over the past few months I have been suffering with on again and off again headaches where I can feel pressure at the top of my head and sometimes get a pain in my jaw on the right hand of my face, I than begain to notice that throughout the day I get very large veins/arteries running down both sides on each temple on my forehead, with the right hand temple being far more noticable are very large so I started to become more concerned as these are extremely large and I've never noticed it on anybody else or myself before. I started looking up my symptons online and everything always links back to Giant cell arteritis (GCA). I am only 23 and thought it couldnt be that because usually it is seen in people over the age of 50 but did my research and there has been cases of children as young at 12 having GCA. I decided then to go to my doctor and they ran a blood test to check my SED rate, which came back normal but I'm terrified it might be GCA or something else that I don't know about. I have taken pictures of when my temples are flared up just to show what I'm talking about because I've no idea what is causing these arteries to flare up, anyone have any advice? I'm actually terrified it might be something bad and I'm being fobbed off by my doctor!

"news flash!  Just got back from seeing my gp (whom I love); good news:  I'm gonna live!  Bad news:  I'm gonna live!  On a serious note, I asked him his opinion on split dose prednisone, expecting him to say no way but to my surprise he said he just got back from a conference with rheumatologists who said they are now recommending split doses for their prednisone patients!  They said their success rate is much greater for all the reasons mentioned here on this forum.  
My gp said I can try either a small dose in the evening and a larger dose in the morning, or half and half,,,he said to experiment.  Which of course I have read about here on this forum--so helpful!  So glad I found this site!  Just thought you would want to know that rheumatologists at least here are saying split dose is preferable....I'm starting tonight....

"ever since I've been on prednisone, my face and eyes look puffy...like I'm a sick person (which I am, right?). I developed pmr in August 2016 and started pred September 2016.  I don't have moon face but my eyes always look ""sick"".  Like I'm suffering from an allergy.
about the same time as the pmr, I developed corneal edema (mild case) and cataracts--never ever had any eye issues before, only wear reading glasses occasionally.  (I blame pmr for these issues but that's another story probably).  Anyway, yesterday I saw my eye doc and asked about the bags under my eyes...will they go away when I get off prednisone?  To my utter amazement, he said no!  That once the soft tissue becomes fluid filled, it loses elasticity and won't go away.  His solution:  ice packs 3-4 times a day for the rest of my days.  I sorta started blubbering--not because I'm so vain, it's just that another annoying side effect has befallen me from this whole journey.  Yes, I know there are a lot more horrible side effects, but still....he said I could see a plastic surgeon,  nope, never.
so today when I saw my gp, I told him my sob story--he concurred--in fact, he, too, had seen a plastic surgeon for bags under his eyes; the plastic surgeon told him the same thing, plus the surgeon said he preferred to never do surgery because it wasn't recommended,  he said.
anyone else have puffiness under their eyes?  Anyone ever have it go away?  Sometimes mine is worse than others, caused by fluid retention from the prednisone.  I hope you don't think I'm vain, I'm kind of an earth woman, not much makeup or bling, just curious as to yet another seemingly never-ending turn of events along this pmr journey.

"I would be very grateful for some advise.
I am 59 years old and was diagnosed with pmr and giant cell 8 years ago and i managed to get off steroids a few years ago.
In the last few months all the symptoms of prm are here again (luckily not giant cell).
I am stiff in my shoulders, neck and back, which lasts all day. I cannot get up from sitting and cannot move in bed.
My blood results have always been normal. Within 3 days of steroids i am a 'new chick' again.
My problem is taking steriods with covid about. Do you i should go with the stiffness and ride it out?
Taking steroids has left me with cataracts and weak muscles.
I really do not know what to do.

"I have told two doctors that I want off Prednisone. It seems to go in one ear and out the other.
Some history: I have had muscle pain for years and have controlled it well with Aleve. I have had two back surgeries, one involving fusion, for Spinal Stenosis and a hip replacement. A year and a half ago I developed pain in my left should when reaching overhead for a bowl out of our kitchen cabinet. Put up with it for awhile, then decided to see the family doctor. He put in a Rx for 20 mg tabs of Prednisone taken at 3 tabs oral daily for 4 days, then 2 tabs oral daily for 4 days, then 1 tab oral daily. That took care of the shoulder pain. That is where I should have demanded to end it. I continued taking 10 mg for 10 days. All this time I am off Aleve and of course my muscle pain comes back. Kept telling the family doctor I wanted off Pred so I could go back to Aleve. Finally had enough and ask to see a Rheumatologist. Of course I had to start over and be off pred for a week and have blood work done, sed rate and C-Reactive Protein. Family doctor did this as well. Reactive Protein was never out of the upper or lower normal range. Sed rate was 19 and above only twice in about a year and a half. C-Reactive Protein was out the very first reading with the family doctor and never since. My Rheumatologist has had me drop 1 mg per month from 10 mg. I have insisted that I want off to see if I can function with taking aleve. In looking back I should have insisted my family doctor put me on a prednisone regiment like he did for a sinus infection. That was about a two week time frame, starting at 20 or 40 and dropping down.

"From a recent discussion I have just learned the existence of Silent Acid Reflux (laryngo-pharyngeal reflux (LPR)).  I wish I had known about this last year as it would have saved me going to doctors and having tests that were for the wrong reason.  My GP and I thought my symptoms were from sinus issues but seeing an allergy doctor for testing, following that doctor's special diets, antibiotics for possible sinusitis and even seeing an ENT for a CT scan of my sinuses came up with no improvement.
Eileen has posted some excellent information on a recent topic called:  ""Has Anyone Taken L-Glutamine with Prednisone"" and when I saw the list of symptoms I was shocked.....they were all my symptoms and my problems weren't from my sinuses but from my stomach.  I've seen many references to acid reflux on this forum but since I don't get heartburn or ""acid regurgitation/taste in throat"" I didn't think it applied to me.  How wrong I've been.
https://patient.info/forums/discuss/has-anyone-taken-l-glutamine-with-prednisone--492183
I am starting a new discussion about this so if there is anyone else on this forum with symptoms like mine, you will be sure to see this information.
Now that I know the problem I'm hoping you can tell me about what you have tried for your acid reflux problems (silent or not!)
1.  Does your reflux decrease as you get to lower doses of prednisone?
2.  Does it go away when you have been off prednisone?
3.  The Mayo Clinic says to raise the head of your bed.  I've also read about sleep wedges you can put on top of your mattress.  Anyone had good results with these?
4.  The Mayo and Cleveland clinics say a throat camera scope may be needed (an in-office procedure).  I'm suspecting this test is for long term serious symptoms and not short-term caused by prednisone and that I don't need to push for it.  But did you have the scope test or did your doctor just tell you things to do/meds to take?
Here is a portion of Eileen's post from the link above as it lists the symptoms of Silent Reflux.  There is a lot more information about this condition in that discussion topic.
The most common symptoms of LPR are:
- A sensation of food sticking or a feeling of a lump in the throat
- A hoarse, tight or 'croaky' voice
- Frequent throat clearing
- Difficulty swallowing (especially tablets or solid foods)
- A sore, dry and sensitive throat
- Occasional unpleasant ""acid"" or ""bilious"" taste at the back of the mouth
- A feeling that too much mucus/phlegm is collecting in the throat
- Sudden coughing or choking spasms at night
- Chronic cough
- Excessive burping, particularly during the day

"Hi, it's a long time since I've been on this forum which suggests all has been well but that's probably because I was so happy at 7mg that I did not want to risk tapering. I stayed there for quote a while. Anyway, I went from 7 to 6.5 in August last year using DSNS which seemed to go ok. I went from 6.5 to 6 over Nov/Dec just gone and don't recall any major initial upset. However, I have a feeling that it may have started a tiny flare because I took one dose of 5.5 last week and oh my goodness I definitely am struggling a little now. I have symptoms in neck and around my collar bone which I never had originally (2018). What I really would like to know though is can pmr affect you ribs (I guess intercostal muscles) because I find it difficult to take as deep a breath as I would like and feel it like a bit of a restriction. It definitely feels ribs though, not lungs. Thank you in advance.

We gradually have decreased the dose and increased and decreased and increased until my usual rheumatologist left the hospital.

"Hi,
56 normally v fit consultant in NHS.
I noticed relatively rapid onset of very painful quads muscles at night on holiday after some intense exercise with a lot of stair climbing. Initially thought I'd just overdone things but there was no improvement after a few days as expected. Over next few days the symptoms became progressively worse causing waking in the middle of the night due to the pain. At its worst I simply had to get up for around an hour making tea and waiting for some relief with more NSAID's. It was very difficult to turn in bed and hard to get up in the morning due to the pain and stiffness such that I couldn't bend to pick things off the floor or tie laces without great difficulty. Symptoms were predominantly muscular and spread into the upper arms. Quite a lot of pain began in the gluteal muscles spreading into the hamstrings which made sitting uncomfortable first thing in the morning. Even walking was difficult in the mornings although things improved progressively throughout the day and with the help of NSAIAD's I was not too bad at all by the evening many days.
At around this time I also developed very sore left wrist on the opposite side to the thumb which stopped me playing golf as I could not grip the butt of the club due to the pain in my palm. As I had an old injury in this wrist which occasionally flared up I did not initially connect this with the other symptoms. I think I had also lost a little weight.
Initial thoughts were Lyme disease or Leptospirosis contracted on holiday as I had been in a prevalent area and swam in some lakes. I started Doxycycline whilst awaiting serologies at the advice of a colleague in view of the need to treat both of these diseases early.
I continued struggling into work for a couple of weeks until I finally realised I had a real problem which was causing significant sleep disturbance and consulted my GP for the first time in ages. He decided on urgent Rheumo referral although at that stage I thought it was a bit of overkill (what do I know!), still expecting things to somehow wear off spontaneously. I think he could see how ill I was more than I had realised myself.
The Rheumatologist sent the full battery of bloods but at this stage was not entirely convinced it could be PMR partly due to my age which is a little young in comparison to the majority of cases and initially prescribed stronger NSAID's together with an acid suppressing drug to help prevent gastric ulceration.
ESR and CRP were slightly raised which he felt was significant in view of my otherwise good health.
By the time of a review with the Rheumotologist 10 days later it was clear the Doxycycline had made no difference and the infectious causes of my symptoms were ruled out by the bloods. By this time both he and myself were considering PMR as the most likely diagnosis and I was ready to start steroids without further delay as the symptoms were causing such discomfort that I was really struggling to continue working.
The night after starting 15mg Prednisolone was the best night I had slept for over a month although the symptoms and morning stiffness were by no means gone.
I have now been taking Prednisolone for 9 days and am feeling a lot better. the nocturnal muscle pains have almost completely gone. Energy levels are improving, I have greatly reduced the amount of NSAID's needed to keep me going.
The painful left wrist is only improving slowly and I have had to buy some support splints to help with this.
During this illness I have tried to keep swimming which I think has helped me cope with some of the symptoms and maintain muscle muscle tone and flexibility.
In conclusion I think I have been suffering with PMR and have been fortunate to see a reasonably rapid response to steroids at not too high a dose. The diagnosis can be difficult and it can take quite a while for you to realise yourself that you are actually ill and not just suffering the effects of aging or OA flaring up.
I hope this perspective from a medically qualified patient may be of some help to fellow sufferers in making sense of their symptoms and getting diagnosed.

"I recently ,""(2 weeks ago) was diagnosed as having Polymyalitis rhumatica, after suffering a sudden attack of symptoms a few weeks before. I was put on a low dose of prednisone fir 5 days and felt much better. Still feel good if I exercise a lot. My main concern is that even though my appitite is good I am loosing 1 to 2 pounds (1/2 to 1 kg) a day. Since I am 5ft 11inches and already down to 142 pounds from me normal 155pounds this can not continue moer than a month or I will weigh less than 100 pounds. I wonder I any patients have had similar experience and if so what happened? Did it stop?

"I have worked out for years, and lost 15 pounds of muscle in 15 days. Does anyone have any suggestions about working with weights while you have PMR? I seems to do better regarding pain when I do lower weights and high reps. I am new to PMR and would like to improve the learning curve regarding working out. Any suggestions, based on personal experience? Also would appreciate thoughts on amount of daily protein intake - right now I am consuming at least 400 gm per day.

"Hello. It's been about 9 days that I've been having pain in my chest.
I went to sleep fine and woke up with a pain in my lower chest just below the breast (in my rib bones) which since then has gotten worse and spread in the lower rib bones.
It hurts me only when I touch it or when I raise my hand. I can breath perfectly fine and don't feel a thing. So if I don't touch it I am perfectly good.
I didn't get injured and I didn't have a cold.
Just woke up and had the pain. Maybe it got worse because I also started gym this week but the pain appeared before I even registered to gym.
it feels like someone hit me with a bat or I fell down.
I spoke to a doctor and she told me its probably just muscle pain from a cold without any further exam.
I am a 24yo male.
Should I worry or was the doctor right?

"Story of Polymyalgia Rheumatica
First I developed what was eventually diagnosed as fibromyalgia at 34. Then had endometriosis and got a hysterectomy at ago 40. Then a left knee replacement. Then a right knee replacement. While recovering I scooted on a bath bench and hurt my back; I had two kyphoplasties and a third fracture that was left to heal by itself.
Finally about 2010, when I was about 57, two years after my husband died, I felt a new kind of pain, more intense than the fibromyalgia. This pain was through my shoulders and waist, arms, legs. I went to a rheumatologist and he put me on some prednisone to see if I had what he called Polymyalgia Rheumatica. Over the next few days, I felt brand new.
I gradually reduced the Pred to 13mg, but after a bad pneumonea, I went up again to 25mg. Now for the last five years I’ve stayed high on prednisone. I got down to 16 recently, but then went into the nursing home with what the drs thought was my fracture in my back. But I noticed the pain was fierce in my shoulders, arms, waist, hips, legs, just like the bad Polymyalgia. The xrays didnt show that the fracture was any worse, but I spent a month lying flat with horrible pain in my shoulders and neck mainly. The drs don’t want it to be Polymyalgia, I guess.
But yesterday, here at home, I accidentally took two doses of pred. That is 38mg. By evening I felt completely normal and free of pain! My mind stopped obsessing on my health. I read my book, played on the computer; I was myself again!
This, along with reading the papers from my rehab nursing home saying my back fracture wasn’t serious after all, I feel I have PMR, that the back problem wasn’t necessarily caused by Pred.
I wish I could get help . Is there anything to do besides prednisone nowadays?

I have been suffering with all over body pain for over a year and have had blood tests that showed I was incredibly healthy. Asked my doctor to recheck my labs since it was over a year ago. I received a call from his nurse that my levels were high and he suspects I have PMR and prescribed me Prednisone 20mg for 3 days then 6 days at 10mg and let him know if it helped! I'm on day 3 and have some relief and I'm afraid that means its not working or that its not PMR. Anyone wanting to share their experiences would be appreciated!

"I've recently been diagnosed with PMR after contracting it during covid in Aug 2020. Took months to figure it out. I've been on prednisone now for six months. Still can't get below 9mg without terrible fatigue and pain coming right back. I'm not sure which is worse the side effects from prednisone or the disease itself. I have massive problems with fatigue and depression. I live in Kansas and the heat and humidity makes it near impossible for me to go outside, I can't handle it. I sweat just trying to do simple things like get ready for work or doing dishes, etc. I've gained 35 lbs and still counting. I don't eat anymore than before but no matter what I do the weight just keeps creeping up. I was already overweight now that has added to my list of issues. I get winded easier and can't do much without having to sit and rest. I'm growing a pretty good beard and my acne is worse than ever before and I'm damn near 60 years old. This has ruined my life and I feel helpless. Yes the prednisone helps the pain but what about the rest of this mess. When does it get better? Then I get mad at myself for getting on my pitty pot when so many people are much worse off than myself but it's very hard to stay positive. Does anyone have any advice? I don't go back to the Rheumatologist until Sept.

Doesn't last long but really awful.  Feels different from the hot flush from menopause.  Heat comes from my back, if that makes sense, and then spreads to my neck etc. back gets so hot that I have to stand up to cool off.  Could this be withdrawal symptoms from preds and if so how long does it last.  We are in our summer with 35 degree temperatures and I am suffering with at least 10 a day and wakes me at night.

"Diagnosed with PMR back in 2014 and been dealing with it since then - 69yo male. Over the past two years been successfully using the slow reduction method I learned about on this site. My US doctors were unfamiliar with it but have been interested in my improvement using this method. Things were going real well until about early March. I was down to 2mg prednisone per day and starting to split doses to get down to 1 mg. I was feeling pretty good and looking forward to getting off prednisone for good this year.
However my aches and pains have returned since about early May and been quite troublesome. I am uncertain that they are all due to PMR or that something else is going on. I have the traditional PMR shoulder stiffness and buttocks/trunk soreness and stiffness in the am and pm but more importantly my calve muscles and shins and sometimes ankles and feet are almost in constant pain. I have never had pain in these areas with the PMR, hence my uncertainty as to PMR. The calves are constantly stiff and sore and burning and I have difficulty getting up and down etc, and it affects my gait particularly when i have been on my feet for long periods.
Have any of you experienced pain in the calves/shins/feet/ankles or know what else may be causing the discomfort i am experiencing? It is a new pain area that i had not previously experienced and I suspect something else may be causing.
I have emailed my rheumatologist and she suggested increasing my prednisone to 3mg day which i have done recently and checking back if no improvement.
Appreciate any feedback or comments.

"Thank you for accepting me on your forum. I was diagnosed with PMR four weeks ago. The way this disease so quickly stopped me in my tracks was scary. The pain was crippling and the stiffness debilitating. But the steroids have been amazing. And I have just reduced them to 12.5mg. How can I keep the weight off so I can keep my blood pressure on an even keel ( I take three BP tablets). Another question is - I like a drink so can I keep on with three or four pints of beer or three glasses of wine every now and then. Thank you

"Many of the discussions on this and other forums lead to comments on  of prednisone and sleep.  I just wanted to point out that medication affects each of us differently.  I started on 40 mg of prednisone and definitely had problems staying asleep.  Althought I didn't like the idea of sleep aids (side effects and addiction) I succumbed to the recommendation of my practitioner to take 5 mg of Zopliclone. It worked and allowed me to get at least 6 hours sleep each night.  I had no noticeable side effects to the Zopliclone.  Five months later (after a relapse and return to 40 mg at 2 months) and at 30 mg I was experiencing excessive brain fog and fatigue throughout the day.  At the suggestion of Eileen and others I switched taking the prednosone to the evening around 9 PM.  When I did it I thought, what the heck, if the steroid is causing fatigue I'll drop the sleeping pill.  I did and have slept fine since!  Mind you I'm up every hour and a half or two hours to pee, but I go back to sleep.  Frequent urination in the first 8 hours of taking prednisone is one of the many side effects I suffer. 
So I guess the message I'm sending is that we all react differently to different medications.  It's wise to remain flexible.  What doesn't work for one, may work for another.

I have been on this dose for about 6 months now and though not all pain free it is copable. Rheumatolgist wants me to reduce further. Tried 6 and a half. No use had to go back to 7.
lately though my right shoulder and right side of neck have been extremely painful. Even seems to annoy the muscles in right hand side of throat. Left shoulder bit sore if I lift my hand above head but not too bad. I am right handed so not using right arm to rest it is difficult.
Has anyone else found one side worse than the other?

"Hi Everyone!
In search for information about PMR I have come acress this site with lots of information and links.  I have learne a lot and in return I would like to contribute about the topic of PMR and excersize....
Background: I am 66 years old and have suffered first attack in mid November 2015... I have been fairly active person and have done some triathlon in the past, so not being able to get out of the bed on my own was pretty shocking to me... It took about one month to diagnose PMR and I started medication (prednisone) at 15mg/day mid December. 
If there is an interest, I would like to post about the progress in recovery, with special attention to excersize. I am seeng specialist every 2 weeks and complete blood work is done to monitor inflamation caused by PMR.
I would like to post what I have done thus far and future progress in (hopefully) sucessful recovery.  Please let me know if there is enough interest in the subject.

"I just wanted to let everyone know that after five and a half years I have eventually made a full recovery from PMR.  This forum was the most helpful part of my journey - the encouragement, shared knowledge and advice (especially on reducing prednisone dosage) was a lifesaver. I even introduced my GP to this site. Thank you sincerely, fellow sufferers.
?I was diagnosed at age 58 and seemed to get it rather severely but now it has gone without a trace,  I haven't lost any muscle strength, and my energy levels are back to normal.
?My PMR began suddenly one month after my mother died of cancer ( I cared for her at home while working full time and also looking after my husband who had torn his quadriceps tendons from his kneecap and was on crutches). My mother died in January, I had a flu jab in the first week of February, and in the second week of February I found one morning that I couldn't get out of bed without help.  What caused the PMR? Take your pick!  Both stress and flu vaccination together would be  my guess, but there's no way of knowing.
?For those of you who are having trouble reducing prednisone, don't despair!  I always took as low a dose as I could bear - always lived with a fair amount of pain because I was conscious of the side effects of the drugs. Halfway through I got stuck on 10 mg and thought I would be on it for life, but then slowly I reduced until I got stuck on 4 mg for about 3 months.  After that I reduced slowly, slowly as advised in this forum until after 5 years I could feel the PMR starting to let go of its stranglehold. 
?At the end I was actually taking half a mg every second day - nibbling a bit off a 1 mg tablet and saving the remainder for two days later.  After a fortnight I thought it was too ridiculous for words, so I stopped taking any medication.  Believe it or not, the rotten PMR flared up quite severely as if it was saying 'Hey - I was using that!'  I refused to go back onto prednisone because I'd have had to take a higher dose, so I persevered with the pain until it eventually dissipated and I returned to my old self.  I still can't do a full leg squat, but maybe that's old age working against me at 65!!
?It's a wonderful thing to be able to do the things that I couldn't do for 5 years.  I can use my heavy cast iron casserole dish because I can actually lift it out of the cupboard now.  I can wear a t-shirt because I know I can get it off by myself.  I can try  on new outfits  and new bras without help, and I can dry myself properly after a shower because I can swing my arms above my head.  No longer do I have to fall onto the bed after work to have a nanna nap, and I can enjoy a brisk walk and even my bicycle is getting used again.
?The only advice I can give to anyone who is newly diagnosed is don't push yourself to do stuff that you used to do.  You need to rest, accept your limitations, and look after yourself.   After years of swimming through treacle, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

Finished Pred. about a month ago, straight away started feeling stiffness in my fingers, aches all over, but no symptoms of GCA. I waited until I had a telephone consult. with my Rheum. (who is great), she said it was probably ost/arthritis and the Pred. had been treating it. I take hydrocortisone as my adrenals are slowly waking up, the dose was increased to supplement the Pred when I came off it.

"I have been diagnosed with FMS and disc degeneration. I have been using Tramadol for over twenty years. In addition I have been prescribed Hydrocodone (5mg) to be used as needed for major pain cycles that will not respond to Tramadol. Thirty tablets of Hydrocodone last approximately six months; one tablet when required.
This plan has kept me employed for the last twenty years and now that I am retired, it has allowed me to continue to mostly enjoy life . As a patient of the Minneapolis VA system, I frequently find myself assigned to a new primary physician. The latest refuses to continue prescribing my medication, indicating that she feels it is a fatal combination. The VA has refused to do surgery, indicating that they could improve the mechanics but not remove the pain. She has prescribed Gabapentin as an alternative to using Hydrocodone as needed. In addition to not being nearly as effective on pain, I cannot function the day after I use it.
I am beginning to understand the thought process that leads to seeking drugs outside legal channels. The pain that results from this change in medication may prompt me to inform my family and friends of the situation and my preference of continuing to risk taking the ""fatal"" combination as I have for over two decades.
Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I was diagnosed with confirmed GCA on March 22, 2021. I was placed on 1000 mg a day for three consecutive days (infusions) I was then place on 120 mg a day for 2 weeks, and have been gradually titrated down this past week to 50 mg. I am new to this and have all the common symptoms of steroids, insomnia, weight gain, etc. and understand that part. My question is since my GCA is controlled, WHY do I still feel like death. I've lost the majority of my muscle mass. Prior to this, I was strong as a horse, played competitive tennis well into my late 60's, but now I can't even get up when I stoop down without help. I am exhausted, have zero stamina, and I don't understand what's going on. I'm seeing 4 specialists, but have only seen my new rheumatologist one time. My ESR reached 121, and he was more concerned with talking about the fact that he was more worried about my having cancer. He did a huge battery of testing and labs and thank God, I got a call from him last Friday saying that cancer was ruled out. Can any of you guys shed any light on this. I don't have my follow-up with him until May 24, and I need help now. Thanks so much

"My symptoms began about the first of March 2021. The first thing I noticed was that I was getting leg pain from sitting. It wasn't the first time I'd had discomfort from sitting, but the chair I was using was one I'd used for years, but it still could be the chair or just sitting, so on March 10th, I ordered a stand up desk (I am at my desk long hours, 7 days a week). I also added another cushion to my chair. On March 17th I went to my PCP and saw a PA about the leg pain. At 73, I'm concerned about hip arthritis. On examination, the PA thought I had piriformis syndrome (he didn't call it that, but he directed me to do PT using a foam roller). I couldn't get the x-ray that day, so I went again the the PCP on March 25th, and got the x-ray and a cortisone shot in my right buttock, and a prescription for prednisone (20mg per day for 5 days). By that time, I was also starting to have pain in my right shoulder, which was worse at night. This was not new to me because I had previously been diagnosed with impingement syndrome for which I received cortisone shots, which made it go away. The x-ray was negative. The day after the cortisone shot, my pain was gone everywhere. This lasted one day. As time went on, the pain got worse, and I am extremely stiff in the morning and I get a throbbing pain in my right shoulder that wakes me up at night. I had some Percoset on hand, so I started taking that when the pain was the worst, either middle of the night, or first thing in the morning. Never more than one 5 mg tablet per day. I am very leery of taking too many opioids. I had gotten a referral to see an orthopedic specialist, which I did on April 20. He x-rayed my right should and it was negative for anything. He diagnosed bicep tendonitis and sent me to PT, which I started on April 29th. I went to PT once a week for a month and also did the exercises at home. One odd thing about my condition was that during the day the symptoms went almost completely away, so I had no trouble doing the PT as long as I did it in the afternoon. The PT did not help. On May 4th I went back to the PCP clinic to ask for more Percoset; they would not provide it. I asked for referrals to get an MRI and to see a pain specialist. Those appointments were a month out. The PA also offered to give me another cortisone shot which I put off at that time. On May 11th I was back at the PCP clinic. Here are the notes from the PA:
""Patient was counseled extensively on suspected tendinopathy. Upon patient's insistence a right shoulder injection was provided. Patient had no pain in clinic so relief could not be determined. Patient was given 1 week prescription for Percocet. Patient advised no further refills would be provided from this clinic as it is not appropriate management of this type of pain. Patient was advised again to follow-up with orthopedic specialist to discuss multiple treatment options. Patient advised to continue physical therapy. Patient follow up with pain specialist. Patient completed MRI. Patient to return to clinic if signs or symptoms of worsening condition developed.""
""Other: After a full discussion, the patient voiced an understanding of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this treatment plan and accepted them. The patient has been told to ice his shoulder for 20 minutes 3 times a day for the next several days. If he does not have frank improvement in his symptoms within a week, We will proceed with MRI to evaluate the rotator cuff. If there is some improvement, The patient will follow-up for repeat injection.""
During this time, I also started taking NSAIDs, first Aleve, and then 2400mg per day of ibuprofen. This had no effect. I had also been given a prescription for Celebrex, and which I filled and started taking in place of the ibuprofen; no effect. The Percoset provided more but not complete relief, but it did allow me to function after getting up the morning (typically 3 am).
On May 25th, I had arranged through the orthopedic clinci to see a rheumatologist. In five minutes he said, ""you have PMR"". He put me on 20mg per day of prednisone, and it had an immediate effect. I can sleep my normal amount of sleep without being awakened by pain. The pain and stiffness is still there in the morning, especially my right shoulder, but it still goes away during the day, so I can function fairly well.
The symptoms do not appear to be lessening after being on prednisone for a few days, but the rheumatologist said we would increase the dosage as needed. Right now I feel like it's going to take more.

"hello everyone. I suddenly developed pain in legs, pelvis, buttocks, upper arms, shoulders and neck. we thought it was a flare of my fibromyalgia which I have had for over 15 years. However, GP said he thought it might be PMR. So only thing showing up in blood tests was an ESR of 35 .....
so as I am in agony , cannot even turn over in bed, nor get up from chair, without awful pain, for about 4 months now... GP prescribed just 5 days of 30mg prednisolone. However, I'm sitting here staring at box !
i have paroxysmal AF for which I take Metoprolol and I am on Warfarin.
Also, is it right that this is a self limiting disease? and can last up to to 5 years? However, I don't see anyone reporting back that they are free of it .
Thanks for any advice or reassurance ......

"Hello again - I havent been on this forum for quite a while so I may have missed this topic being discussed many times over, in which case apologies! Im 68 and just into my third year of PMR . Have been slowly tapering to the point of managing really well (with some residual neck stiffness) on 2.5mgs alternating with 2mgs of pred (occasionally missing a day due to forgetfulness!) Since my first dose of the Pfeizer vaccine on 10 Feb I have noticed a gradual flare creeping up on me and a telephone review from my GP has put me back up to 10mgs to be tapered to 7.5, then 5 for a few weeks. I wonder if others have had similar experience following vaccination for Covid-19? I had absolutely no adverse reactions following the jab.

"Hi All,
I'm managing the PMR quite well, although off steroids I still suffer pain and stiffness, but certainly nothing like the start of the condition. My biggest problem now is ongoing vaginal thrush. I never had it while on high doses of steroids, so can't understand why now. I know our immune systems are still not working properly even though off steroids, So I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same boat?
Many Thanks,

"Hi, Im 42 female and worried sick that I have giant cell arteritis. It all started back in mid November 2020. I started to get pressure type pain in the top middle of my head. Also felt very sick, I was tapering from 150mg of setraline to 125mg so I thought it must be that. By end of December 2020 I was having all over headaches that come and go. The pain in my left neck was getting worse and my face including jaw where sore. In January 2021 I made an appointment for the opticians and explained to her my worries. After many tests she sent me straight to the emergency Eye clinic. I got lots of tests done and had very slight swelling behind my eyes. The consultant dismissed mine and the opticians worries saying that I'm to young for giant cell arteritis and in his 30 years doing his job, he had never met anyone under 50 years old with it. I got blood taken and was sent away. While waiting on getting called to have my blood taken I could hear the nurses talking and they were saying they would of gave me steroids just incase. Worried sick I phoned the out of hours doctors who left me some valium to calm me down. ( it didn't work). After nearly having a breakdown with stress I went to A and E, who were nice but agreed with the consultant that I was too young and my eye sight was very good and they could touch my head and scalp and I wasn't crying. They made an appointment for me the next day back at the emergency Eye clinic to see the same consultant. He didn't seem happy to see me and said my bloods were perfect and he knew they would be. Said he wasn't worried, said I won't go blind, I don't have giant cell arteritis ( still don't believe him) but he would send me to the neurologist anyway for my peace of mind. But I'm still having headaches that move about, I still have facial pain and my teeth feel like there getting pushed out my mouth. I get pains coming and going in both temples all day, down behind my ears are tender. I still have blurry eyes that water a lot. My eyes are very painful, they ache and feel tired and strained although I wear my glasses all the time. I have very bad neck pain both sides but mostly left. Headaches thst move about and a tender sore scalp. My right shoulder is sore and the pain goes down my arm in to my thumb. ( could be carpel tunnel syndrome but my wrist splint isn't helping). I also get aching legs and hands. The neurologist phoned last week and was really nice, he said he dosent think I have anything to worry about but is sending me for an MRI to put my mind at ease. I told him about my fear of Giant cell arteritis and how my symptoms are getting worse. He said that Its hard but I need to trust the consultant eye doctor, he said all three of my bloods were fine ad showed no inflammation at all. He thinks I'm having neck headaches as they can be very painful and affect just about every bit of your body. He also thinks that my mind is constantly thinking of Giant cell arteritis and going blind that it's creating the exact symptoms of it. ( I do have severe health anxiety) I told him that my greatest fear is losing my sight and if I was blind I would end it all. He said that that I'll not need to do that as he thinks I'm fine and if I had giant cell arteritis my bloods would of been off and my eyesight would be getting bad by now. I just cannot shake it. And I keep checking Google and up comes giant cell arteritis all the time. I truly do want to trust the eye doctor but I can't. Can someone please help me x

"My journey with GCA began in December 2000 without knowing it yet. First alarming symptom was a short breakdown of vision in November, so short, one would not be able to be seen at an eye clinic, and it would probably be seen as a kind of fluke.
But my doctor got me an appointment at a general department at outpatients and two days before that my left eye went crazy, like someone had thrown grey-brown paint in my eye.
I went to the clinic and of course immediately referred to the eye clinic where I spent an afternoon with tests. The registrar mentioned some of the things I was tested for, and the last thing they would look at , would be GCA and a possible biopsy. She mentioned it was a nasty condition.
But they really had nothing to go on, I didn't have headaches, nor jaw claudication, only the eye.
Mid December I was diagnosed...provisionally.... as having NAAION, and put on low level aspirine. The specialist felt the arteries, but everything was soft and fine, not what seems to be expected. We did discuss GCA, but it seemed utterly unlikely. He offered me the biopsy, if I really wanted, but I thought that probably would be a waste of time and a bit scary too.
Well, the next thing that happened was totally new, stiff thighs and arms, and pain, starting not long before Xmas, it got rapidly worse, and I became almost like a cripple, and then early January, I finally found out what jaw claudication was.
I contacted the eye clinic, and they put me on 60mg prednisone straight away and booked a biopsy....turned out positive.
The prednisone has been a blessing in some ways. The stiff and painful thighs melted away the day I began the prednisone, that was such relief. The arms began to follow the next day. This indicates an associated condition called polymyalgia rheumatica, also treated with prednisone, but it has actually not even yet been diagnosed now. It has disappeared.
But the other side of the coin is the most horrible insomnia, and after a week of madness, I started on sleeping tablets.
There are other side effects but that is probably different for everyone. The dose had to be toned down to 40 mg and I nearly completed 4 weeks of it, and will slowly go down then.
I hope to be admitted to a worldwide research programme for a immuno suppressant especially developed for this condition. Will try anything, have nothing to lose.
I'm a professional classical musician and would like less of the brain fog, which is quite unbelievable, after taking the prednisone at 7 pm in the morning, the fog blanket descends in full two hours later, and only after the main meal at midday it starts to clear a little, but never completely does so. However, my music performance skills seem to have become absolutely wonderful, and concerts continue. This must be the euphoria people talk about. Creativity everywhere, that is also amazing. So it is not all bad.
The aim is, not to lose the other eye. I'm quite hopeful it can be controlled some way, am only scared at the lack of signs of a possible flare, in which case I have to up the prednisone. Have to look for further deterioration of left eye, perhaps jaw claudication. But that happened only twice anyway.
Like Sandy, I was a fit and healthy individual, keen gardener, plenty of exercise, very active at 73. No medicine, apart from supplements that I take for osteoporosis, that I do have, but treat naturally, with the best food possible. Have been on bisphosphonates for 3 years in the past. Don't really want that again.
Cheers from Christchurch, New Zealand.( would be great to correspond with you, Sandy, but wouldn't know how to bring that about)

"Hello! I’ve been on prednisone for almost 2 years for an indefinite diagnosis: the symptoms are very like Polymyalgia rheumatica, which I had several years ago, but nothing is showing up in my blood tests. I have fibromyalgia and my doctor thinks it could be a flareup of that. It’s definitely stress-related.
Being on steroids has definitely helped, but when I got down to 3 mg the pain flared up really badly, along with terrible exhaustion. I’m on 2 mg at the moment and some days I seem to get by (I have to push myself), but other days are really difficult.
I decided to have a swim yesterday as I haven’t been exercising, and today the pain has been absolutely awful, along with terrible muscle weakness and exhaustion. It’s not the usual muscle pain and tiredness after exercise.
Could I be reducing the prednisone too quickly?
Why would I be feeling so bad after the exercise?
Even though I’ve reduced the prednisone, I’ve actually put on weight.
My doctor said I could go up to 10mg if I want to, but I’m reluctant to do it.
I’d appreciate any thoughts you may have
Many thanks!

"After long term pred use i am now seeing my first known major prednisone side effect other
than weight gain ,skin bruising etc.
A couple of years ago i had a major flare and with a few hiccups it has taken me about
18 months to get under 7 Mg daily. At 6 1/2 Mg i started to feel unwell, so upped the dose
to 7 Mg
This seemed to clear things up but lowering to 6 1/2 , again i was unwell. I see sawed the dose for some time before seeing my GP, who said she suspected my adrenal glands were lazy , if not completely wrecked.........
Recently i had a tummy X ray and CT scan for an unrelated problem.
Amongst the report was a reference to my adrenal glands that said............
Both adrenal glands are moderately to severely hypoplastic.......
My GP explained this by saying your adrenal glands are stuffed through
long term prednisone use............
So now i have to take for life , a dose that keeps me feeling ok........
This i have to determine myself and for a start have settled on 7 Mg.
At this dose the PMR will , hopefully , look after itself.
Maybe if i had persevered with lower doses for shorter times ,things
may have turned out different , who knows...................
Yeah , so that is where things are at the moment, time will tell...........

"Hi again. I have reduced from 25mg and am down to 15mg having reduced 1mg a week which I understand is very quick. I now have pains in my neck and shoulders every morning which does get slightly better during the day.  I was wondering If I stick on 15mg for a while am I likely to get any relief. Are the pains likely to go away if I allow the doesage to stay the same for a while or is my body needing me to go on a higher does again and if so what would you suggest. I think I know the answer that I am trying to reduce too quickly but am scared that pred is making my Osteroperosis worse.

"It seems a long time since I was here... Still on my long journey with Pred.... up and down as they say but beginning to understand my own body a little better... I have been on this journey now for 5 years.
Just before Christmas I was on 8mg and things began to worsen again. I didn't want to increase if I could help it but was feeling awful so it made no sense to stay where I was. I then remembered reading on here a few years back about someone splitting their dose... I started to take 4mg in the morning and 4mg in the evening and things improved. I stayed on 8mg until the middle of January and then started to reduce again. Unfortunately I have increased pain again, not sure if it is withdrawal or PMR pain but have gone back to 10 to settle it down and now on day 2 and its is feeling a lot better. I have realised that 8mg is probably where my limit is for now. Plan to head back there soon but will sit there for a good few months before I try to reduce again.
Dr is happy to continue prescribing pred and Rhemy appointments have stopped due to Covid. Not sure they can do much anyway. I have now seen 2 and both have been very unhelpful. Waiting to see a third but think the waiting list is now a year long! I feel this is now my journey and beginning to understand my own body so not sure what a Rheumy could do anyway now and less bothered about seeing one.
I just wanted to share this in case anyone else wants to try a split dose... it worked for me...

"Hi,
Since 9 days, I have been developing bulging temporal arteries on both temples (they're suddenly very visible with also a very visible pulse). This started off with only the right temple, but has now progressed to both temples along with a headache on both sides and a rash on both temples. When visiting the doctor, he is more thinking a headache because of stress or bad ergonomics while working, however, he told me to come back in 2 weeks (especially because of elevated blood pressure).
Although it seems like I'm not at all the profile of GCA (male, 26-year old, otherwise healthy), if looking for what else it may be I'm only finding GCA as possible explanation for the symptoms I'm having.
What are your thoughts? I'm thinking of going back to the doctor next week at least.

"Hi all
I have/had Polymyalgia for almost 5 years. I was down to 1mg of Pred and was managing just fine. The doctors have insisted I stop taking the Pred and I haven't taken any at all now for four months. My blood tests are fine and show normal levels of inflammation.
I consider myself, in all other ways, a fit, healthy 55 year old female.
However, I seize up terribly.  I can’t stand from a sofa or chair without pain and such tightness. When I stand, it takes seconds before I can begin to move and my joints begin to work.  I can’t squat down or stand up without pain.  Yesterday I went for along walk.  When I got back, I dropped a glove on the floor.  I couldn’t even contemplate bending down to get it.  It took a minute or two for me to unlock my seized joints to be able to slowly –and painfully – bend down to get the glove, I needed to squat.  I then contemplated the fact that I didn’t think I could get back up.  I require support to stand from a squat position, often just my hands on the floor to support me, but yesterday, having walked for some time and seized into that position, I needed to find support from a table and then brace myself for the pain as I stood.  The pain is a brief, tingly, sharp pain, never as bad as the anticipation of it. 
Is this the residual effects of polymyalgia. Do others live with pain years after their blood tests say that they no longer have it?
I'd appreciate knowing whether others are in a similar position and what they have done about it as I'm getting very concerned.
Best wishes

"Hi all,
I'm actually posting on behalf of my Mum. Will try and keep this succinct but it's going to be difficult!
So, Mum is 60 with advanced renal cell carcinoma. However, her cancer has been kept under control for years with a type of drug called pazopanib and has been relatively limited, although it has started growing again slightly recently.
Mum has believed she's had PMR for years, but it hasn't been formally diagnosed. She convinced her oncologist several months back to allow her to go on a short course of low dose steroids (prednisolone) which she said improved some of her PMR-like symptoms. However, as she began to taper down she noticed some of those symptoms returning along with a sort of hard to describe head pain/ache behind her right ear. She also noticed some jaw pain on the same side that she describes as relatively constant, but that gets worse upon eating.
So, as she was tapering she suddenly gets a low grade fever, a terrible cough and this jaw pain. Is admitted to A+E and her ESR and CRP are found to be pretty high (ESR over 120 I believe). Her lungs are clear and she's sent home. Cough resolves and the fever doesn't return. She makes an appointment with a rheumatologist (who she said was terrible - showed no interest/understanding of her case) and convinces him to go on 50mg of prednisolone. She says this improves her jaw/head symptoms mildly but they remain.
Mum was on the 50mg for about 3 weeks and they've had a pretty dreadful effect on her. Diabetes, high blood pressure, major fatigue/weakness etc. She saw another rheumatologist about a week ago who doubted she had GGA because the pulse in her temporaral arteries was bounding and there didn't appear to be any sclerosis or blood flow issues. In addition her inflammatory markers had gone down but then back up again whilst on the high dose steroids, which suggested to the rheumatologist that something else was happening.
The problem is, Mum is utterly convinced she has GCA and really won't be told otherwise. She has an obvious extreme fear of going blind and now she is tapering down from the 50mg (currently at 40mg) she says the jaw/behind the ear pain is increasing. And, the biggest fear here is that at the moment she can't even take her cancer medication because she feels so weak/exhausted - we are keen to get her back on the cancer meds but she feels unable to take them whilst on the steroids, but also terrified to come off the steroids or taper down as she's convinced she has GCA. It's a tough one.
She doesn't appear to have all of the GCA hallmarks. She doesn't get headaches as such, nor does she get temple or occipital pain (instead it's around and behind her ear). She also doesn't appear to have significant shoulder weakness or pain - though I understand GCA is hard to diagnose and no one symptoms rules it in or out. But it's also curious that the steroids didn't seem to have an appreciable impact on the pain/discomfort - might have reduced it somewhat, but not definitively. She does have some visual issues (double vision sometimes, general visual deterioration) but we also know she has cataracts and of course is now diabetic, so that may or may not explain those things.
Just looking for some input really. Does this sound like GCA? I appreciate a diagnosis is not possible on a forum but I'm just looking for as many voices as possible. I'm not 100% convinced it is, and neither is the rheumatologist, but I also appreciate we could be wrong. Mum is absolutely convinced it is, but she's going purely on how she feels. Quite frankly I'm not sure there's a doctor in the world who could convince her otherwise anyway, but we want to do everything we can to try and (hopefully) rule it out, reduce her steroids and get her back on her cancer meds.
Is there any specialist or place it might be good to turn? At this stage I just need to sound out all options, try and get some kind of definitive diagnosis and get a plan together for Mum to move forward with or without a GCA diagnosis. Thought it would be good to ask those in the know and get some informed opinions. Thanks in advance for any help or input you can offer!

"Info please.
Diagnosed with PMR Autumn 2019. Had symptoms four months before that. Down to 5mg steroid by May 2020, stayed on that for 3 months - with very little help, info treatment or advice due to Covid. Felt isolated and uneducated. GP just keen to get me off steroid. Started taper. Been off completely for four weeks. Feel lousy. Disturbed sleep. Joint pain, tingling, extreme anxiety feelings. Okayish in am, by early pm want to go to bed to rest - that's when tingling and restless legs set in. No neck, shoulder, hip girdle pain. Have lost 18lb of steroid weight gain, still need to lose 16lb. Could additional weight be aggravating chronic knee pain? When do I know that adrenal function is supporting body function? I feel steroid has hidden a lot of my long standing joint pain e.g. knees and right shoulder ache. Had these for years before PMR. I developed steroid induced diabetes.
Review with GP this afternoon. Dreading it. Just going through the motions of me moaning and him concluding it's steroid withdrawal and I need to battle through it. Is there an alternative?
Many thanks for any thoughts on this.

"I have been suffering from a tender scalp, neck and shoulder pain and sudden onset depression alongside headaches in the temple for 1 week. Also been feeling generally unwell for a couple of months but I just put this down to tiredness. I went to the doctors who said she is 99% it is GCA regardless of my age. This is due to one other cause of GCA being prolonged anitbiotic treatment (I have hydradenitis suppurative and been on antibiotics for 4 out of the last 5 years). 
I am still awaiting test results but having read up on GCA I am panicking about the possible complications. Im on 30mg of dilacort daily as of today.
I was wondering how long it should take for me to feel relief as im still in severe pain. Also if any body else was diagnosed young as all stories I have found have been from 40+. 
I am just looking for some friendly advice from someone who has been through or is going through the same as I do not know anyone with GCA!

"My PCP diagnosed me with PMR in April of 2019 after 4 months of increasing pain - started in the shoulders, neck, then hips, and then knees. Worse after no activity. Tylenol and Aleve only helped mildly. After tests to rule out Lyme and other things, my PCP said I had PMR and I started on 20 mg of prednisone and felt much better within 5 days. Over time, I tapered the dose to 12.5 mg/day which kept me feeling good. In Dec of 2019, I started to get headaches, and since I hadn't had a headache in 9 years, I became concerned that I might have GCA. I started seeing a rheumatologist who put me on 60 mg of prednisone in case I did have GCA. The headaches went away, but I felt like my head was going to explode at that high dose. I've been decreasing prednisone slowly over the last several months and am now at 3 mg. At 7 mg, the pain in my shoulders returned. I now have pain in my shoulder, hips, and knees just like I did at the beginning. I have a hard time getting dressed and can't sleep due to the pain. Before all this, I was a very active 59 year old woman who worked out 90 minutes every day, including boot camp, yoga, walking 10k steps/day, etc.
My rheumatologist doesn't think I have PMR because my sed rate is low (has never been higher than 38 and is currently 7) and 95% of her PMR patients went off prednisone within 1 year and were fine. She sent me for xrays and to see an orthopedic doctor. The ortho said no issues with the xray and suggested I see a musculoskeletal doctor for myofascial release therapy. That doctor is scheduling out in March.
I'm at a loss. Do I have PMR or not? Any suggestions on next steps? Thank you all in advance.

"i have been absent from this forum for a few months.
Finally got to see Rheumatologist and it had him baffled at my PMR starting in my right knee. But that's a long story.
I am at present on 9mg Prednisone but on 10 when i saw him.
He told me he wants me off Prednisone ASAP and to drop at least 1mg a month and even as low as 1mg a fortnight.
My GP told me that the level i take should be such that there is no pain.
Hence conflict, but i guess you have to run with the specialist.
I feel I am floating on the edge at 9mg so in one week I will try 8mg and see what happens.
It is in my case, very beneficial for me to keep physically busy, I cycle and go to gym and if i miss a day my chest and shoulders become very tight and ache. Main downfall is the tiredness, easy bruising and constipation.
So that's where I am at presently.

"I have had PMR since August 2006 and started on 15 mgs of Prednisone. I have tried to reduce the dosage twice, 1 mg reduction monthly and each time I have got down to 9/10 mgs the symptoms have come back and I gone back up to 15 mgs. The last occasion, the increase did not get my symptons under control. My rheumotologist has now put me on Lyrica, 100 mgs per day increasing to 150 mgs, reducing the Predinisone by 1 mg per week. So far this seems to be working really well.It is is the first prescripton drug made available for Fibromyalgia. And treats nerve pain. But seems to be working on the PMR, the symptons of which seemed to be crossing over to Fibromyalgia.
Wonder if anyone else has any experience of this drug?

"Hi everyone,
I'm a 55 year old man - usually very active. I've had PMR about a year (starting on 20mg) and was tapering Pred reasonably successfully - up until recently...
Was OK on 5mg Pred, and did a slow'ish taper over 65 days to 4.5mg without any major issue but then due to a mix up at my GP, was repeatedly refused the prescription for my 2.5mg tablets. With only a limited supply of the 2.5mg left (I was taking 1x2.5mg + 2x1mg) I decided (perhaps foolishly) to continue tapering straight down to 4mg, which seems to have led to a pretty bad flare-up/steroid withdrawal.
I appear to have set myself back to where I started a year ago - i.e., PMR so bad I'm unable to bend down to put on my socks & considerable joint and sharp abdominal pain to the point that it's waking me up at night.
I went back up to 5mg just a couple of days ago but I am still really struggling with the pain & lack of movement.
Could anyone recommend what level Pred I should go back to and for how long? Or should I just try & ride it out at 5mg for a few weeks in the hope my body will adapt?
Having put in so much hard work to get down below 5mg, I'm a bit reluctant to go too high but any advice would be gratefully accepted (my GP is pretty useless at the moment and it's almost impossible to get even a phone appointment...)
Thanks,
Alan

"I was diagnosed with PMR 3 years ago and have been on prednisone since then (starting at 15 mg, now at 4.5 mg). My CK in 2017 was 85. My next CK test was last week, and CK was 1024 (normal is 0-160 unit/L). Can you give me any sense of what this means for my body?
I have a lot of health problems in addition to PMR, including OA in my knees , hip pain that may be an early stage of RA, and Myofascial Pain Syndrome (chronic pain) in my back and neck for 33 years.None of these is new.
My PMR feels pretty controlled at 4.5 mg (I finished from my DSNS reduction from 5 to 4.5 at the end of September).
Any thoughts about where this inflammation might be and what it might be doing (my doctor--not rheumy--says it's destroying joints somewhere)? I see the rheumatologist on Monday and would love some advice/questions/info to take in with me.
I recently had an echocardiogram that indicated Pulmonary Artery Hypertension, which is caused by inflammation, but then a second echo showed levels closer to normal, so the cardiologist said not to worry about it. But I am fairly worried about it, especially after these CK results.
Anyway, thanks for any thoughts you can share.

"Hello,
This is a long story but I went to a Chiropractor Office 2 weeks ago for an assessment and subsequently (and regrettably) allowed someone to adjust my spine and neck. I was weary about neck twisting so I asked if there are any other gentle manipulation options. So instead he used a tool with 2 big prongs, and hit my neck about 5 times with it. To my surprise and anger, it was very forceful and not at all gentle. Right when I stood up I noticed my neck was sore on one side , but this dissipated over the next hour or so. Later that night, I developed a headache in my forehead that felt really odd , but of course these things can happen after a spinal adjustment. Over the next few days the headache moved around a bit, eventually settling in my left temporal area. Then the right temple started. This has been ongoing for 2 weeks now and I am quite scared as it feels like a lot of pressure in my temple areas, sometimes moving around a bit. I noticed the temporal veins very slightly protruding, something I never noticed before but could be coincidence? I also wake up nearly every morning with numbness around the sides of my head above the ears. The intensity varies and sometimes I do not notice it as much. I have tried tylenol, advil, and muscles relaxers that have no noticeable effect on the pressure/pain. I finally went to an Urgent Care one night, who then referred me to the ER when I explained it had been ongoing for 10 days following a chiropractor visit. Of course before this I had already googled my symptoms and was very anxious to learn it could be Temporal Arteritis / Giant Cell Arteritis. I mentioned this to the ER doctor who quickly dismissed it as non-sense saying I don't fit the typical profile of an elderly asian female. He suggested that it is a regular migraine or tension headache (which I hope is the case!) and wanted to inject me with an anti-psychotic called Haldol , which I declined! My ESR and CRP were ran and they are LOW/NORMAL, however after reading more I have learned that ESR and CRP are not always raised with this condition. I followed up with a family doctor who also dismissed it due to the lab work, and prescribed some muscle relaxers. I am at a loss of what I should do as I am very scared , not only at the thought of a late (if any) serious diagnosis, but also of the thought of taking Prednisone as treatment as I have already had numerous health issues, medication side effects, and I have severe anxiety since 4 months ago. I developed severe Tinnitus (ringing in my ears and head) after being prescribed Lexapro for anxiety, so now I am very scared to try other medications as nearly all of them are ototoxic. And I am only 35.
Questions: How likely is it that I have TA/GCA? Is severe tension headache more likely? I suppose my neck could be spasming causing it - however I do not have any pain in my neck. Is it possible the force into my neck triggered some inflammatory/autoimmune reaction that has resulted in TA/GCA??
Is the pain/pressure associated with GCA constant or can it let up at times? It does not feel ""throbbing"" nor is it constant but seems to come and go randomly and sometimes moves to different areas.
Are there any other indications or ways to test if this is GCA versus a tension headache?
Thank you in advance.

"Hi there.  I've been on Prednisolone for 5 weeks now.Saw my GP for a review last week and he has reduced my dosage from 15mg to 12mg per day. I have to see him again in  2 weeks time.  So far so good apart from feeling a bit achey generally.  He is sure that the weakness in my legs and general fatigue is a side effect of the pred and should disappear as I reduce the dose further, which many of you have told me already.  My question now is this, have any of you suffered with restless legs since being on pred?  Most of the time it's not too bad but some days, particularly in the evening and during the night it can be quite troublesome.  Is this another side effect and is there anything I can do about it?

"Hi,
We wanted to let you know about some changes to the way that Patient.info Forum updates are set to be delivered.
After looking at our data along with feedback from a number of users, we realised that some users were receiving a huge number of emails from us as a result of activity on the forums.
While we realise that some users welcome regular updates, for the majority it was a bit of an issue and it also meant that some email providers stopped important updates from reaching our users.
As a result, we're making the following changes in the coming weeks:
Browser notifications for Private Messages and Replies
Instead of (or alongside, if you choose) receiving email updates, you will now be able to opt in to browser notifications. This will reduce the number of updates that you get to your inbox and allow you to instantly access new messages.
Simply click ""Allow"" on the prompts when you next visit Patient.info Forums or visit your settings notifications page to update your settings if you want to opt into these notifications.
Changes to forum emails
• You will now only receive emails for forum replies and private messages.
• New discussions from your groups will not trigger an email.

"George has been successfully reducing his Pred over 2 years and two and a half weeks ago he reached two and a half mg a day without apparent problem.
He saw his rheumatologist ten days ago. She added twenty mg of Hydrocortisone a day to his prescription.
She also gave him a Cortisone injection in his knee, for arthritis (which hasn't helped the arthritis pain, unfortunately!)
This morning he has sudden, very severe jaw pain that isn't responding to Paracetamol or a cold compress (he said he thought he'd prefer cold to warm).
I'm a bit worried, he's clearly in a lot of pain from his jaw, I'd be very greatful for any idea about what might be happening here?

"Hi Guys
I'm 13 Months in with PMR and 57yr old.
When you get to my age its harder to keep your weight in check, but with The Lockdown and PMR it's been a mare.
My Question is about Exercise. I used to be an avid walker, but the pain in my hips and groin have put that on hold. Can I ask about thoughts of using a rowing machine.?
I have tried to be careful but need to strike a balance. I am down to 5mg Pred, only using PK when pain is at its highest.
As with Most of the other Threds I have read, most people have a reaction after overdoing it. All, any thoughts most welcome.

"I am on a journey to work out why I've been feeling so unwell for the past 18 months. I have constant pressure headaches, painful neck and and back and terrible sleep and concentration problems. I'm 46. when i was in my late 20s I developed severe Peyronie's disease (in a strange place that still gives me constant nerve pain) and frozen shoulder in both shoulders. The pain in the shoulders burnt out after about 4 years. In my 30s and 40s i've been treated for depression and my GP thinks my current problems are a symptom of that and wants to put me onto a stronger SSRI. I'm convinced something else is going on. I've lost a stone in the past year and can't put it back on despite eating lots.
I wake up in the night from about 3am with gastro pain, pain around my kidneys and headaches and feel like a zombe during the day. I gave up alcohol last December as I was feeling so bad but still feel hungover all the time. I'm a University lecturer and have had to go part time because of the mental exhaustion.
Just before lockdown I was diagnosed with plaques in my heart and carotid arteries (I was being investigated because my Dad died young of heart disease) but my cholesterol is not very high. I don't know if that's relevant. I also have weird intermittent upper leg pain (in both legs) that is only alleviated by lying down with my legs raised. I also have prominent arteries in my temple and my eyes are very sensitive to light. I also feel like someone has just shone a bright light in my eyes all the time. I've also developed dupuytren's contracture in my left hand over the last couple of years.
Could it be GCA or PMR? With Covid going on I get the impression my GP thinks I'm a bit of malingerer and I'm reluctant to hassle them more. Is it worth asking for prednisone to see if anything improves?
I have suffered from bouts of anxiety and depression all my adult life and I am very familiar with the symptoms. This feels completely different.
I'm a bit desperate and exhausted.
Any advice would be much appreciated.

"Yeah !!!! I am finally getting down to below 3mg. What a relief! I realise others have probably asked similar questions to me, many times before, but I am old, tired and have forgotten how to look back on the site for previous information.
Has anyone experienced some weird mental 'changes' at this stage of lowering the dose ? I noticed changes when I first took Prednisone, so I thought changes may happen as we get low on our dose as well. My main problem is my memory has taken a much worse dive in the last few weeks. Has anyone else experienced this ? My other problems may be influenced by world situations, but my fuse has really shortened recently. I am a little surprised by this, as I am actually in a very favourable situation, during this world chaos. Has anyone had any mind changing alterations at low doses ?

"I’m a female in my early to mid-30s that eats healthy and (used to) disciplined gym go-er.
It started in Mid-November of 2019 when I tore my left meniscus (knee cartilage) after leg day at the gym. From there I was hopping around with a cane going to physical therapy bi weekly. Fast forward to July 2020 where I started to feel noxious and had serious stomach aches. I was only able to eat a very small amount (maybe a couple of eggs) and feel completely full and sometimes stomach cramps... soon to find out that one of my housemates contracted Covid-19. Soon after taking multiple covid tests and waiting for my results, I had consultations with my doctor online and she said that she thinks I could have Covid-19 GI (Gastro-Intestinal). Fortunately enough, my results came back negative and after 2 weeks the stomach issues subsided after a lot of IB profin and Pepcid for acid reflux.
I started to go back to physical therapy for my knee where I was doing clam shells, leg raises, etc. and my left hip gradually started hurting. As I would walk with my cane, pain would start from my left hip. Over a few days it would go to the left side of my butt, then down to the front of the quad, and then it would go back up to my lower back between the hip and the spine. It’s been 3 months and has become worse where I’m not able to sit down, do normal activities and now on disability. The pain started on my left side, so as I started to lay on my right side, the right side also started to be in pain. It’s only (sort of) comfortable when I lay down flat, but even then I get jolts of pain where I have to adjust myself to sort of make myself feel comfortable or take more medication (Gabapentin). I think the pain starts at the joints and then makes its way to the muscles. The pain travels.
I’ve seen my general doctors, spine specialist, neurologist, chiropractor and have done acupuncture. The doctors thought it might be lupus, the chiropractor thought it was a SI joint problem, and my acupuncturist confirmed that I have hip tissue damaged. I’ve taken Blood Tests. I’ve done MRIs on my back, knee, hip (had small tears but doctors said this shouldn’t be the issue), and even brain (that was so painful). All of my bloodwork, all of my nerves, all of the xrays of my back, knee and hip came out normal. The only thing that came back low was the TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) which meant the thyroids were really active (doctors said I shouldn’t worry because the t4 test came back normal).
I’m running out of options here. I was prescribed IB profin and Prednisone. The Prednisone gave me an allergic reaction where I had stomach aches. So now I’m on IB Profin, Gabapentin, and some topical gels that I place on my hip and butt. All of my test results have come back normal and they can’t seem to find what’s wrong. I want to put this out there to see if anyone has been through something similar. Just looking for another solution. I appreciate any help!

"My name is Jonathan and this is my story; I am a 46 year old male who contracted temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis or GCA) with amaurosis fujax and nearly went permanently blind.
By setting out the sequence of events it is my intention to assist others to diagnose this rare (2.2/10 000 persons) auto-immune disorder when it arises in younger sufferers and thereby prevent blindness and other serious complications which can occur when the condition is not identified sufficiently early.
My GCA was not diagnosed early as a result of a combination of circumstances, most notably my age and gender which both contradicted an obvious diagnoses, and the onset of the swine flu epidemic which at a key time diverted resources at my GP’s surgery from blood tests to inoculations.
I have tried to be succinct and objective (this account runs to four pages), to include sufficient detail to inform, but not enough to bore; I hope I have achieved my objective, if not then I apologise.
I have maintained a good level of CV fitness all my adult life, and although I am slightly overweight (6’0 tall, 95kg) and drink above the recommended level, I don’t smoke and am by and large in very good physical and mental health. My research indicates that it may be relevant that from 13 to 16 years old I suffered from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
That said, by the summer of 2009 I had been suffering for some months from a painful right shoulder that ached particularly at night. On occasions the pain was severe and only reduced by the application of heat and the taking pain-killers and anti-inflammatory ‘over the counter’ drugs.
Eventually I consulted my G.P. and, following an x-ray which showed there was no injury to the joint, I was diagnosed with ’frozen shoulder’ (with hindsight, this was most certainly the first symptom of my GCA and when I began taking prednisolone it was the first to disappear).
Then on 10th September 2009 I banged my left knee against the sharp corner of a heavy chair whilst at work. Although I took very little notice of it at the time, this event would coincide to the day with a rapid decline in my health.
What the injury to the knee most certainly did (I had in fact I had broken my cartilage) was to mask other symptoms of GCA that were beginning to emerge; most notably of which was an intense aching in both my lower legs; I erroneously attributed this pain however to the knee injury. No more than a week after my legs started to ache I experienced severe fatigue, but I put the fatigue down to the aching legs and the aching legs down to the knee; it all seemed to make sense, for a short while at least.
Over the next week the aching got worse, especially in the morning, the fatigue became more debilitating and the shoulder breathtakingly painful. In addition, I began to suffer from night sweats but with no accompanying fever. It began to dawn on me that these symptoms could not all emanate from a relatively unexciting knock to my knee.
So on 18th September I went to my GP presenting fatigue; he ordered a blood test, but the swine flu epidemic meant that I had to wait until 5th October for the test, then over another two weeks to get the results and see my GP again. When I did, on 23rd October, I was informed my C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was 137. My GP referred me to a consultant rheumatologist and suggested that I might be suffering from systemic lupus.
At this time (5th to 22nd October) I could manage no more than a few hours work before having to return home early to collapse exhausted on the settee by mid-afternoon; pain-killers and anti-inflammatory tablets became part of my daily diet. I was losing weight, about a stone, or to be more precise I was losing all muscle tone. I was feeling very unwell; so unwell in fact that I gave up drinking for a week!
I continued to work, proud of my impressive sickness record and contemptuous of those lesser mortals who succumbed to illness; whatever else was happening, the air was thick with hubris.
Whilst awaiting to see the consultant (23rd October to 2nd November) I started to improve. The fatigue reduced significantly and the pain in my shoulder became sporadic; the aching legs continued but lessened.
During this period however a completely new and quite disconcerting symptom emerged, an extremely tender scalp. At first this was at the back of the head, just above the neck; then it moved over both temples and latterly to behind both ears. It was as if my head was bruised and my skull was sensitive to the touch; it was not a head-ache but something distinctly different.
On 3rd November I had my first appointment with my consultant, a very experienced Senior Rheumatologist at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, who after careful and protracted examination assessed that I was unlikely to have systemic lupus but was more than likely suffering from either vasculitis, temporal/GCA or possibly lymphoma; incidentally a more recent blood test showed an CRP of 87 and an E Sedimentary Rate (ESR) of 88.
One significant matter seemed to be troubling my consultant, as I was too young to have vasculities or temporal arteritis; he expressed concern that I may in fact be suffering from endocarditis, which he explained was a medical condition emanating from an infection of the heart/aorta disorder; to assist his diagnosis he arranged a CT scan of my heart and abdomen.
On 13th November he started me on a low dose of steroids (15mg of prednisolone); he was proceeding cautiously, an approach with which I was concurred.
I researched GCA and learnt of the threat it presented to my sight; I learnt that men were more likely to go blind than women and that blindness in either eye could be followed by blindness in the other within a week. Once lost, the sight could not be returned.
Within days, the shoulder improved, the legs ached less but were still uncomfortable, and the scalp tenderness decreased but still troubled me.
Then less than a week later on 19th November, I lost my sight almost completely four times in my left eye within a two hour period. Each time an area of deepest black appeared across my vision and increased until I was nearly totally blind, and then, five to ten seconds later it cleared.
I went to A&E immediately and, some hours later having argued hard with the staff to convince them I wasn’t imagining it, I was eventually prescribed 30mg of soluble aspirin and 60mg of prednisolone. A blood test taken at this time showed a CRP of 67. I was sent home and erroneously and repeatedly reassured the loss of vision was nothing to do with my GCA.
The following day (20th November) upon learning of my loss of vision my consultant immediately admitted me to hospital to facilitate the rapid administration of a serious of drugs, 1000mg of methylprednisolone, tinzaparin, simvastatins and dispersible aspirin to combat the threat to my sight. On this day I reported sick from work.
The CT scan on my heart and abdomen showed nothing untoward, importantly I did not have lymphoma, and several detailed eye tests revealed no permanent damage.
Both eye consultants agreed with my consultant, I had experienced several episodes of amaurosis and been extremely fortunate not to go blind; truly terrifying though the episode was, it strongly supported the GCA diagnoses which my consultant had made less than a week previously.
On 23rd November my CRP was 15 and ESR 17 and with it the threat to my sight was slightly diminished. I wasn’t sure whether I have been extremely unlucky or extremely unlucky. At this time, I was on 60mg prednisolone a day.
Over the coming week (24th November to 1st December), and whilst on the very high dose of prednisolone, several things happened:
The sensitivity in my head reduced significantly.
My left knee, which the attentive reader may recall I injured months previously, actually started to hurt with the onset of an intermittent sharp pain and was uncomfortable to walk on.
The pain in my shoulder ceased.
My legs no longer ached.
The night sweats stopped, although they had already significantly reduced.
The prominent veins in the back of my hands re-appeared.
Having extensively researched the symptoms and reading the accounts of others with this condition, I have absolutely no doubt that the diagnoses is correct; one symptom I have never experienced though is the jaw stiffness about which some 50% of sufferers complain, research suggests the ‘jaw’ symptom is more common in females and ‘blindness’ in males.
Interestingly, the onset of GCA is more prevalent in summer and in the south rather than the north of the UK, both factors are in common with my own story (for these and other findings see Dr Liam Smeeth’s 2001 study entitled “Incidence of diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis in the United Kingdom, 1990–2001”: Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine).
On 27th November, a further blood test, whilst still on 60mg of prednisolone a day, returned a CRP of 3.2 and a ESR of 5.
On 30th November I had an MRI scans on my orbits and brain and optical nerves; both were undamaged with venus flow in the cavernous sinus normal.
On 3rd December my consultant instigated a plan to reduce my prednisolone from 60mg per day whilst monitoring my CRP and ESR readings.
On 8th December my CRP was 5.4 and my ESR 5; it appeared the GCA was coming under control; at this time my prednisolone dosage had reduced to 25mg.
On 17th December an ECG, an echocardiogram and an examination by a cardiologist eliminated endocarditis or any other heart related cause.
On 18th December my CRP was 7.2 and ESR 5; at the time of this blood test my prednisolone dosage had been at 18mg for a week.
And on 21st December the results of a temporal artery biopsy of 15th inst. showed no evidence of inflammation to suggest the presence of a temporal arteritis. However, temporal arteritis is a segmental process which is not excluded by a negative arterial biopsy.
By now I was feeling significantly better and only troubled by, pain is the wrong word, sporadic feelings of pressure in my head; sometimes its over the temples, others at the back of the head - it definitely moves and some days are worse than others. The sensation not painful, just disconcerting.
So by late December 2009 the GCA appeared to be in remission, and the process of gradually reducing the prednisolone whilst carefully monitoring the blood for inflammation had began.
Throughout these events I have come across medical professionals who because of my age either did not consider or, once I had been diagnosed were sceptical about my very experienced consultant’s diagnoses of GCA; but my research clearly indicates that whilst it’s occurrence in persons under 50 is rare, the medical world is in fact littered with cases of GCA involving people under 50, and interestingly a higher proportion of ‘younger’ sufferers appear to be male.
Indeed, in 2008 a 46 year old male was diagnosed with GCA in Derbyshire.
To quote Anthony Allen MD Chief, Interventional Radiology, Brooke Army Centre US, an Associate Professor of Radiology as recently as 2008; “Although temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) occurs almost exclusively in patients older than 50 years, well-documented cases have been reported in patients as young as 40 years“.
So guys, don’t dismiss GCA…our sight lies literally in your quick diagnosis and swift treatment.
Kind regards
A 46 YEAR OLD GIANT CELL ARTERITIS SUFFERER.

"Got a diagnosis 7 months ago and have had a fairly easy time getting to 6-7 mg prednisone.  This week I kayaked for 10 minutes and the next day my left shoulder and bicep have been the worst it has ever been.  It did not hurt to paddle at all.  I used the prednisone to 10 with out ant change.  I am thinking a joint issue ( bursa, tendon, muscle  tear or ligament)  I can not really use the left arm without a lot of very sharp pain.  Today just standing with a small twist my left knee got extremely painful and swelled so I cannot really bend it much.  I have reste3d and iced it.  I have had 2 scopes done on it in the past and was not having any problems prior to today.
As I have been on prednisone 8-6 mg for most of 4 months .
Any thoughts?  I am using very cautiously the dead slow method and my doc is letting me take control of PMR and the meds.   Of course this forum has made this possible.  Thank you in advance for any thoughts , ideas or suggestions.

"I had totally forgotten that I found this bit of info well over a year ago when the usual question about the shingles vaccine was asked and wrote a post about it:
""I can't give you the direct link but on a site called ""virginiahopkinstestkits"" There is a quote from Merck ( the makers of Zostavax):
""According to Merck, the maker of Zostavax, “Serious vaccine-related adverse reactions that have occurred following vaccination with Zostavax include asthma exacerbation and polymyalgia rheumatica [An inflammatory disorder that causes widespread muscle aching and stiffness, primarily in your neck, shoulders, upper arms, thighs and hips, that can last months or even years.] Other serious adverse events reported following vaccination with Zostavax include cardiovascular events (congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema).”
The Zostavax vaccine can also cause shingles.
Notice the CDC says that the vaccine is effective for about half the population age 60 to 69, but only provides “some protection” for older groups. As we get older, it’s more difficult for our immune systems to mount an antibody response in response to a vaccine. That’s why the flu shot isn’t very effective for senior citizens.""
You can get a link there for Merck's prescribing info. Google a chunk of the quote and you should get a direct link so you can use it.
If the manufacturers are admitting this it should be taken seriously.""
This is the direct link to merckvaccines where you can read it yourself - straight from the horse's mouth:
https://www.merckvaccines.com/Products/ZostavaxMobile/Pages/indications
If the manufacturers say their shingles vaccine can trigger polymyalgia rheumatica, then I think it is fair to say that if we already have PMR - it's not something we need to risk.

"Sorry to bother you all again. To recap, Been taking pred for 3.5 years, tapered to 4.5mg but on reaching 4mg experienced small flare. increased to 9mgs for several days then tapered back down to 5mgs over several weeks. Am now experiencing moderate neck and shoulder stiffness and some pain. Is it better to control this with pain killers and stick at 5mgs or should I increase again? Note that in Kate Gilbert's book she appears to accept that the duration of PMR is accompanied by some pain. Would rather not increase pred but seem to be in a game with trying to fool body. I was told by GP that it would 'burn itself out' but there seem to be rather a lot of embers left. It puts me in mind of a game called 'statues' played as a child. Want to be as kind to body as poss hence question re pain killers. Am I likely to prolong PMR if I don't squash it with more pred or does it not matter which method I use I.e. pain killers? Thank you all so much for your patience with me it is truly

"It's many months since I have been on the forum. Covid has belittled aches and pains to minor worries in this new and frightening health landscape. However, am so beset and compromised by unusual morning pain that I wondered if forum members could advise on whether this is an expected progression of PMR or perhaps the start of arthritis. I have been on Prednisolone since my PMR diagnosis six years ago. I have never managed to get below 10mgs for any longer than a couple of weeks, so that is my current dose. For the past few weeks I have woken with severe pain in my hands, shoulders and back. I stay in bed with heat pads and after about three hours the pain dissipates. Could this be a flare I've not experienced before and do you suggest I reluctantly up the pred? Or is this what arthritis feels like? I am 73. Thank you - and hope all the owners of those memorable names and advisors from the old formatted forum are well and coping with today's scary health scenario.

Came home better, but the rheum saw a little problem with liver labs so she had me stop the hydocloraquine and another hydrosteroid (I can't find the name).

"okay so, thanks to an allergic reaction to a different med that has now been switched, i was on prednisone for 2 weeks while trying to get ahold of my dr to get the problematic medication changed. i grew up with Asthma and have done many many weeklong tappers of prednisone without symptoms. its always been easy. start at 80 mg the day of the reaction and then drop by 20 each day over a week and be done.
this time i found that while i was using dicolfenic topical gel to treat preskin cancer aka Actinic Keritosis, nothing less than 50 mg would stop the rash that started to appear in places i didn't put the gel.
nonetheless, i figured it was important to keep treating the AKs, as i don't want them to change to cancer. i immediately called my Dr about switching the gel but the lockdown in california made her nearly impossible to reach. so, short story, long. i took 50mgs a day for 2 weeks until i was finally called back ( luckily my mom saved every asthma emergency kit i didnt use throughout my childhood so i had enough prednisone to do this . each kit had a week long taper as i described above... I am in university, by the way.).
this time, the tapering is kicking my rear. i have been tapering for a week now, and the drop from 30 to 25 mgs today made my symptoms return. i went to urgent care on the first day because of the symptoms and they were nice in that they gave me 5 50 mg pills. so i have those and about 20 or so 10mg pills but those are the end of what mom had saved for me.
so, if i understand the very very slow taper thread i should go back up to 30 and try 25 again in a few days? thanks

"Hi,
I recall, when I first discovered this site 2 years ago, reading about members with knee problems linked to PMR, and I remember thinking I was pleased my knees weren't affected.
I was started on 15mg in May 2018 for PMR, affecting only my hips and shoulders.
2 years down the line, I have managed to get to 7mg, and have been at this dose for about 2 months. For the past few weeks I have been having knee problems (but not particularly hips & shoulders - maybe just a tiny bit). Both knees are affected and it's worse at night and in the morning, is awful when getting up from sitting for any length of time but is so much easier later in the day - this is why I'm wondering if it could be PMR related as that's what used to happen to my hips/shoulders originally. It's a stiffness with discomfort, no sharp pain, and is down the inside of both knees. I'm not sure whether to up my dose a little - I'm very tempted because I'm also feeling much more fatigued than is usual for me. Any thoughts on this please? I might also visit the physio (if they're open due to covid) to see if he can shed any light. Thanks everyone.

"Hello everyone. I'm hoping someone out there can help me. I have a possible new diagnosis of PMR. I say possible because we don’t know for sure. My labs were normal. I am 49, I will be 50 next month. My symptoms are all consistent with PMR and the onset was very quick. It got so bad so quickly that I couldn’t even walk. My doctor has referred me to a rheumatologist but I do not get into see that doctor for another six weeks. In the meantime my doctor started me on prednisone. I had an immediate dramatic response. Within hours. The problem is, I was started at 60 mg which I know is high. I tapered by 10 mg every three days. By the time I got to 30 mg my symptoms were almost completely gone. As soon as I went to 20 mg I noticed the symptoms were not quite as well-controlled but I did have a few days that were symptom-free. However in the last week and a half I have had several days of what I would call a flareup. I increased to 25 mg of prednisone and this is now day three. I am still stiff and having some muscle pain. Granted, not as bad as 2 days ago. My question is is this even normal? It seems to me like the dose is awfully high, shouldn’t I be having better relief of my symptoms? And the ultimate question that I really have that no one has been able to answer, is should I be expecting complete relief from all symptoms if I am on the correct dose of prednisone? everything I’ve been reading sounds to me like one can expect to be completely symptom-free but I don’t know if that’s really true. Absolutely my symptoms are probably 90 or even 95% better than they were in the beginning. But I am concerned that I really did have a couple days that were symptom-free and all of the sudden symptoms are back. I have some stiffness in my neck and shoulders and thighs and I also have muscle pain in my thighs and biceps. At this point I’ve been on prednisone just over a month. thank you for any input!

I was really afraid because my paternal grandmother had the same and it ruptured at age 84 and I am 78. Before this I was struggling to get fit again after losing muscle tone over the last 4 years. I was making reasonable progress but my fat intake was not the healthiest that combined with pred elevating LDL and assorted injuries setting me back. So I tried the newest statin called Livalo. I only ordered a month supply rather than the cheaper 90 day supply in case it was a bust. The first few days were OK then I got occasional stabbing pain in both eyes after 7 days and my eyes got so much dryer than usual I was very uncomfortable. Visited my ophthalmologist and, except for extremely dry and blurry eyes the thorough exam was normal. He recommended stopping the drug to see if it gets better and notify my cardio-so I left him a message on y patient portal. If that's not enough I now find it harder to do my exercise routine and even walking is a little wobbly. I am not overweight and actually do not gain easily since removal of 1 1/2 ft. strangulated small bowel.

In April, I started feeling pain in my groin--both legs--and in my right shoulder as well as in my knees. It didn't feel like the pain I had when PMR first started. My question--the Prednisone I was taking could be masking pains that come with aging, so how do I know whether the pain I feel now is PRM pain or aches and pains that come with time. My doctor ordered a blood test , and CRP and SED rates are within normal limits. I have been taking 5 mg of pred, since I had some left over, and that has taken care of any pain that I have.If it's PMR pain, I will take the pred, if it isn't, I will try to learn to live with the aches and pains of aging. I really don't want to take the pred, since I was diagnosed with osteoporosis last year.

"This isn't a question about COVID-19 though it is relevant.
My personal experience suggests that Pred has not increased my vulnerability to infections, and may have reduced it. I have been on Pred for nearly three years, and for most of that time have hovered around 9.5mg, as I relapse if I go lower. During that time, I've had enough time to assess how I've been affected by things like the common cold and related virus infections. We have six-year-old triplet grandchildren so there is plenty of exposure! The summary is that colds/viruses have been significantly less common and less impactful to me over those three years. I get them less often than hitherto, and compared to my wife (when before we often were both affected). Moreover, when I do appear to be developing a cold - nascent sore throat, stuffiness and ill feeling - it stops developing after about 36 hours and disappears, without becoming ""full-blown"".
Any others with enough Pred time to offer an assessment?

"Last year, fed up with hanging around 2-2.5 mg pred for years I decided to try something new. I then started tapering by doing each step of the dead slow nearly stop (DSNS) method twice. This means it takes twelve weeks to taper by .5 mg. Therefore it has taken me a year, longer in fact, to taper to my recently achieved zero.
This is by way of encouraging people who think they will never get off pred. Patience, patience, patience, as with everything else to do do with PMR!

"It's hard to describe this.
I'm 33. I imagine that muscles strain more easily with age, but what about these instances. I've noticed sometimes that if I stretch the bottom of my left cheek/mouth out, the muscles between that area and my neck get momentarily stuck in place.
If I stretch my toes downward (not with my hands, just my feet) they also get momentarily stuck in place and there's a momentary pain cause the muscles lock up. Then it subsides.. It's similar to the feeling of the abdominal muscles straining after too much exercises.
I'm a bit of a hyponchondriac but I'm curious about this because it didn't happen when I was younger and it feels like I could accidentally pull my muscles very easily.

"I am a bit confused now as to what I have been feeling is PMR pain or not. Recently I had what I thought was a flare up with dreadful pain in my right shoulder area. I went up from 4mg to 15mg and then on up to 20mg before the pain went. Had a blood test on Thursday and the PCR and ESR were both 2, which is really low for me. Last time it was 13 and 5. Now however I am on 5mg one above where I was, and I have no stiffness or pain anywhere except for the shoulder area, which is back with an excruciating pain. I am currently rubbing in Deep Heat and taking pain killers to sleep. Now I know I can get rid of this pain by going up again, but is it caused by PMR or something else is what I am wondering? I have not injured myself in any way at all. Does Pred get rid of pain whether it is PMR related or not. I don't want to just mask it by going up again. The pain starts around the collarbone, and in the soft tissue either side, and then up my neck as far as my ear. Also hurts a bit in the shoulder itself. Not sure what to do.

"Hey,
I have been searching information fro what might be wrong with me for a several years now. It seems to be getting worse and so Im trying now different forums to see if I could find something. Doctors generally have been no help.
So, I have constant 24/7 twitching in the soles of my feet, calves and recently now reaching up to my thighs (this was diagnosed a few years ago as ""benign fasciculation syndrome""). Sometimes I feel like my legs are burning or crawling. I have joint pains most commonly in my ankles, knees, and lower back, but quite commonly also in my wrists and fingers. However, all joints periodically can become sore. The joint pain however is not what I imagine arthritis pain to be: the pain dosent restrict my movement almost ever. The pain occurs while Im sitting or laying down and moving my joints eases the pain. It can be hard to find a comfortable position and I constantly have to adjust because of pain in joints.
thanks for reading,
Kevin

"I've been on prednisone for about 2 years, starting at 15 mg and working my way down, now at 5 mg. About a month ago, I woke up one morning with horrible swelling in my calves, ankles, and feet. Doctor gave me a bunch of tests, couldn't find any reason for it. Prescribed spironolactone 25 mg daily, compression socks, reduced salt, elevated feet. This helped, but I had bad side effects from the drug and had to discontinue. Now the swelling is increasing and increasing. Not only calves, ankles, and feet but up my thighs, abdominal distention, and fingers (can't wear my wedding ring).
The only cause the doctors could guess at was prednisone. This doesn't really make sense to me, since I've been on it quite a while and am at the lowest dose I've been in a long time. Doctor said pred could take a while to have this effect. Is that true? Could this be from pred?
If so, is there anything I can do about it? My skin feels like it's getting very tight. I'm afraid how bad this might get.
I've read about the rebound effect from spironolactone and wonder if this increased water retention is due to that. I know this drug affects hormones, and hormones can cause swelling.
I've now been prescribed Lasix, planning to start later today, but concerned about side effects.
Anyone who has experience with water retention due to pred (or anything else), I would love to hear from you and know whether you think this could be prednisone related or if it sounds like something else. And if there's anything I can do beside what I'm already doing and starting the Lasix.
Thanks!

"Since being unhappy with my current doctors attitude and knowledge of PMR i have changed doctors after 26 years. Small town familiarity has lead to poor attitude.
New Doctor;
At present i have been on 9mg of prednisone after a month with a small amount of shoulder pain which i can endure. The new doctor told me to got back to 10mg and that any pain is not good for this condition as it agitates the blood vessels and nerves.
i had forgotten to take the 9mg before i left for my appointment so took the 10mg when i got home. Tonight i feel better and he wants me to stay on 10mg for June & July then go back to see him. He said not to ramp down too fast and that i have done well so far in such a short time, but it's not a race.
He is happy with blood test results and everything else.
So, now I feel a lot better i am being seen by someone who understands and has had experience in this field.
I guess for those of us here, who in the past have being perfectly well, being diagnosed with PMR is a worry and it is good to know that you can trust a doctor to at least care.

After 2 weeks, I started reducing by 2 mg. for 2 week periods. I am now at 8 mg. This week I was sick with a fever of 101 for 5 days, chills, headache and overall fatigue. I pretty much slept for 5 days. Yesterday, I actually started feeling better , but last night and this morning I am in severe pain in my legs and shoulders.

At Christmas Miss Poly will be four years old

But when I bounce back from the horrible drop

I see all my friends, try to have a good time
But I’m careful to cut down carbs, sugar and wine
And as I drop down I am hoping to see

"I have seen great improvement from the chest pain I have been having since January this year, and would say it is about 75% better than it was, which is great. Since stopping both the calcium/bone protection medications, Alendronic Acid and Calceos the improvement is amazing. I had such pain around the chest area, and also around my back to some degree, and it felt like a tight very painful band around this area. I dreaded sneezing or coughing as the pain was really bad. I have upped my calcium intake as Eileen suggested, and am having a daily glass of whole milk plus yoghurt, cheese etc, so hopefully I may have solved this problem. However I had got down to 4 mg pred with just stiffness in my knees and hips, but no pain, until a few days ago when I had a flare up in my right shoulder, the pain has been pretty awful, and I have had to go up to 20mg to get rid of the pain, which I did not want to do, but had no choice. I am also worried that at this level I could have problems with my eyes again as I have glaucoma, and have already previously had problems. I had operations on both eyes for cataracts, and had to have stents in both eyes as well. following on from this I had a Macular swelling in my left eye, which in March had gone down, but I was due to get it checked out again this month, but that won't be happening at the moment of course. I wonder how long I should stay at 20mg-this is the level I first started at nearly 3 years ago, so feels like a very backward step for me. Fed up or what!

"After 2 years I slowly reduced prednisone, was off of it for a year and felt great. Now what is odd, is it came back at the same time of year I originally got this, May. The ongoing fatigue feeling, upper arms, and hips are being effected. Not as bad as when I first got this. It absolutely levelled me where I couldn't even walk. Once on prednisone I was immediately feeling better. For a year I was on 20 mg a day. 10 in the morning and 10 at night before bed.
Now the question I have is do I get back on the pred with this Corona V. around? Knowingly that the pred. lowers my immune system.
I also would like to hear from others.
I'm generally healthy and fit age 59
I first developed symptoms of PMR at age 57
I'm wondering if prior vaccines for the flu or maybe some prior medical procedures could have to do with this PMR
Having some prior shoulder orthoscopic surgery to remove bone spurs with a (Nerve block agent used) years after I developed a small syst. on my spinal nerve which caused bad sciatica, which was taken care of by an injection shot blasted directly at the syst. which worked.
I really believe that some of these medical procedures could have to do with PMR.
Is there a survey for PMR Patients that tracks Prior medical procedures for people who have PMR?
I think it would be very helpful in nailing down the cause and maybe finding a cure all.
Open for thoughts from others on all this.

"My initial pain started in my right knee and so severe my GP was looking towards preparing for knee replacement. From the knee the severe pain caused sciatica in my right leg.
pain from knee and sciatica were so bad i could not sit down or drive.
After x-rays and CT scans my knee replacement was on hold as there was no obvious damage in knee structure.
The pain then went to shoulders and from initial knee pain to now it was 8 weeks.
After self diagnosing my PMR and then asking my GP where do I go from here i started on Prednisone.
Initial dose 50mg which eased all pain in 6 hrs, miracle drug.
on reading various forums i feel starting dose should have been 25mg, as a week on 50 stopped me from sleeping, left me slightly agitated.
So from 50, a week then 25, two weeks to 12.5, three weeks to 10, three weeks to 9 where i am up to now.
i have shoulder pain in the morning but a hot shower fixes that.
I have lost weight due to rapid muscle wasting leaving me weak.
in two weeks i will try 8mg, the shoulder pain i can handle but sciatic pain i can't so we
wait and see.
Before all this i was fit and healthy and only retired from working 12 months ago.

"We have had several replies on the PMRGCAuk forums in general from people who think this is much ado about nothing. We know there are people who don't see the importance of hand washing, of social distancing and avoiding crowded places. And even more so for the members of this and other patient communities who are distressed at the concept of being separated from their grandchildren for 3 months or more and asking out loud ""Would it be SO bad to have a hug?""
So I am posting this quite simple explanation in response to a request from someone else on the forum. I first posted it on the HealthUnlocked forum
FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT QUITE GETTING IT YET.
Copied and pasted from elsewhere:
Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu? Here it is in a nutshell. I hope this helps. Feel free to share this to others who don’t understand...
It has to do with RNA sequencing.... I.e. genetics.
Seasonal flu is an “all human virus”. The DNA/RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system. This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year... you get immunity two ways...through exposure to a virus, or by getting a flu shot.
Novel viruses, come from animals.... the WHO tracks novel viruses in animals, (sometimes for years watching for mutations). Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal (pigs in the case of H1N1) (birds in the case of the Spanish flu). But once, one of these animal viruses mutates, and starts to transfer from animals to humans... then it’s a problem, Why? Because we have no natural or acquired immunity.. the RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn’t human, and the human immune system doesn’t recognize it so, we can’t fight it off.
Now.... sometimes, the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human, for years it’s only transmission is from an infected animal to a human before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human... once that happens..we have a new contagion phase. And depending on the fashion of this new mutation, thats what decides how contagious, or how deadly it’s gonna be..
H1N1 was deadly....but it did not mutate in a way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu. Its RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently, too.
Fast forward:
Now, here comes this Coronavirus... it existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long...but one day, at an animal market, in Wuhan China, in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from animal to people. At first, only animals could give it to a person... But here is the scary part.... in just TWO WEEKS it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human. Scientists call this quick ability, “slippery”
This Coronavirus, not being in any form a “human” virus (where we would all have some natural or acquired immunity) took off like a rocket. And this was because, Humans have no known immunity...doctors have no known medicines for it.
And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus, changed itself in such a way so that it causes great damage to human lungs..
That’s why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1 or any other type of influenza.... this one is slippery AF. And it’s a lung eater...And, it’s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain s, and strain L....which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine.
We really have no tools in our shed, with this. History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics. Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in 1918 and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu.
Factoid: Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him, till the Black Plague passed...(honestly...I understand him so much better now). Just like us, he had no tools in his shed, except social distancing/isolation...
And let me end by saying....right now it’s hitting older folks harder... but this genome is so slippery...if it mutates again (and it will). Who is to say, what it will do next?
Be smart folks... and listen to the scientific advice.
#flattenthecurve. Wash your hands and stay home if possible..... share this to those that just are not catching on
And here is another fairly blunt comment by a doctor from another doctor on his blog:
Dear Readers. Here is a public service announcement from a wise friend of mine.
""Let’s talk social isolation, if you or a family member have symptoms.
No, not the details. Look on the NHS website for that.
More that I’ve become aware of quite a few people who aren’t ACTUALLY isolating themselves. Because, apparently, they couldn’t have the Coronavirus. Despite their cough. Despite their fever.
Do you know what an R0 is? It’s a statistical measure of contagion rates. The Coronavirus has an R0 of about 3-4. So each infected person is likely to infect 3-4 other people.
Now. If you DO have it and you DON’T isolate yourself completely, not going out, you run the risk of infecting people you walk past, people you queue behind in the shops, that person you so politely danced round in the shop doorway, anybody you encounter. Every single one you infect has a 5% chance (probably more) of ending up on the ITU in your local hospital. Yes, on a ventilator.
EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
Not only that, but given current mortality data, somewhere between 15-50% of the people ending up on ITU will die. Yes. They’ll die.
So if you think popping out won’t matter, you’re wrong. You might just cause someone’s death.
So stop being so ****** selfish. Isolate yourselves properly. Follow the guidance properly.""
Credit to the amazing Dr Russell Brown.
Between the two, I hope no-one can claim they didn't know the risks - to themself and to others.
Here in Italy someone turned up at a hospital last week for a nose op. To avoid losing the appointment, they neglected to say they had a cough and fever (though you do have to ask how the hospital missed that) and that they worked in a ski resort where they had been in contact with Covid19 +ve people. He had his op - but as a result the surgeon, anaesthetist and a nurse are all now infected and unable to work and potentially at risk of dying - a GP died yesterday, 52 years old and no underlying illnesses.
This stuff isn't a game.

"Hi everyone,
Still got chest pain, so much so that I have been awake with it since 3 a.m. this morning. Nearly four months now, and still no better. As you will remember my Rheumy Doctor sent me for various tests back in January, and all have been normal. My echocardiogram which was due to take place in April was postponed due to the virus, but I now have a new date for mid-June. However as my cardiologist said he thought there was no problem with my heart, but he just wanted to check to be sure, I am expecting that to be O K as well. I have always wondered if my problem is medication linked, and I stopped taking Alendronic acid a short while ago, however that has made no difference, so probably not that. I am currently on 3mg of pred, and have no pain just stiffness in knees and hips , so I thought I would go up to 10mg to see if this had any effect on the chest pain, but it didn't so I don't think it is linked to Polymyalgia. Back down on 3mg again now. Early last year I had a problem with Adcal, which was giving me sickness and diarrhoea almost on a daily basis, so I was changed to Calceos, and now I am wondering if Calceos is the problem. I have stopped taking it today to see if that has any affect on the chest pain at all. I believe I do need to take something of this nature and wondered if there is anything other than Adcal and Calceos I could try!. Any suggestions please? Thanks.

"I've been reading about how a ""cytokine storm"", can be the final blow to patients of Covid-19 , and not the virus itself. And how doctors are- should, be testing all the patients who end up in the hospital, with a serum ferritin blood test, to check elevated values, for a possible storm. They have medications to calm the storm, ie, steroids, or other possible immune suppressant drugs. I found this interesting, because it is so related to our PMR, (the cytokines who are attacking our immune system).
Anybody else heard about this?

"Hello all,
I've been reading here for quite a while and found it incredibly informative. I'm 48, from Australia and diagnosed last August.
I've been tapering off Pred and was successfully down to 5mg. I'm currently having my first flare up which is scary as hell - I think it flared because of stress associated with whether or not to pull our kids out of school due to Covid about 3 weeks ago. At that stage most kids were still at school so we were going against the grain - turned out to be the right decision as 4 days later staff at the school had to self-isolate after contact with someone who had it.
I tried 7mg for 4 days, no good, 10mg still no relief, 12.5mg same and now at 15mg but still waking with the same pain and stiffness in the morning.
My question is do I give 20mg a go for a week and if the pain and stiffness is still not responding make an appointment to see my GP?
Thank you all in advance.

Normally, I'd have no problem getting back on a low dose of prednisone, but with this coronavirus pandemic, I certainly am not eager to compromise my immune system at all! I'm between a rock and a hard place!
I'm ambulatory but easily fatigued. I could probably handle this without prednisone, but now I seem to be having some symptoms of GCA. (I didn't have this a year ago when the PMR was really bad.) An occasional ""feeling"" at the temples, not persistent. Now a weak headache. I do NOT want an arterial biopsy, which sounds excessive to me, particularly if the treatment for GCA is just to get back on prednisone (but at a bit higher dosage).
Well, that's my circumstance. This pandemic really complicates matters for PMR folks. And obviously millions of people are seriously affected by it. Any comments or advice appreciated!

"Hi
ive been on prednisolone for 13 years for my asthmatic condition. Main side effects are insomia, very weak bladder and thinning of bones and skin. Also my cortisol levels are low and i tire easily. . Does anyone else have similar issues? Im trying to slowly taper off steriods - i got down to 3mg but pain /inflamation in my arm meant i had to increase dose up to 5mg again. Im going to try CBD oil for pain/inflamation. Can anyone suggest a slow tapering procedure please - my Dr suggested tapering off 1mg per month but this isnt working for me. Any advise would be much appreciated. Thank you.

"Hi everyone,
Here is an update on where I am now. I had a gastroscopy, which was clear, and also saw a Cardiac Doctor, who also could find no problem with my heart, but ordered an Echocardiogram, which unfortunately because of the current virus problem has been postponed. i still have chest pain since mid January, and it is no better. It hurts when I sneeze or cough, stretch, and also uncomfortable at night. I have changed my Omeprazole to Lansoprazole to see if this makes any difference, and apart from the fact I don't now have palpitations it doesn't change the chest pain problem. I am pretty convinced it must be tablet related, and plan to stop taking Alendronic Acid, which I have been taking once a week for nearly three years now, as on the paperwork one of its side effects is chest pain. At my last bone scan in January my bones were pretty good, and the Rheumy Doctor said she did not want me to take them for too much longer as they can cause problems. Has any one else had problems of this nature with Alendronic Acid? On the Prednisolone front I am down to 3mg using the slow method over several months, and apart from stiffness in my knees when I sit for a long time, I have no other pain. Any advise welcome.

"Even though i have had PMR for a long ,long time and have been on pred for 16 or so years,i am now in uncharted waters. From my last flare it has taken me over 2 years to come down from 10 mg. to under 7 mg. (1/4 mg monthly on the dsns scale with a couple of set backs. ).Once under 7 mg i dont feel too good at all, mainly fatigue ,head aches etc. It just does not seem like a PMR problem to me, more like a pred withdrawl symptom.So i am thinking an adrenal gland problem. My doc says definitely the adrenals , and no need for a test that involves a stay in hospital and is not too cheap. So, what to do ............... i am told it may take a year or two to kick them into gear, or they may never recover.Now i am on 7 mg and feel quite good, so i am going to stay on that for 6 months then drop down to 6.5 mg and see what happens, if all is good i will stay at that for a while before dropping further.if things go pear shape it is back to 7mg for another 6 months. At the worst i may have to stay at 7mg for ever ,( barring incidents , of corse )..................time will tell i guess ,,,............. .

"Lipitor (or atorvastatin) is prescribed for high cholesterol. When my GP first suggested I start taking Lipitor, I first tried modifying my diet... and did a little research on the web. People in a discussion group who were taking the statin were complaining that it seemed to cause them some muscle pain and stiffness....
Well, my attempt to change my diet didn't change my cholesterol numbers, and after taking 10 mg to start, I did notice some mild stiffness, mainly after sitting for a while.
After many years, the numbers started increasing, and my GP suggested doubling the dose of Lipitor, which I did. It may have been around this time that I was suddenly struck by PMR.
So the question is, is there any association or correlation between taking a statin and suffering from PMR?

"Obviously, prednisolone is an immunosuppressant and people who are immunosuppressed are classed as 'vulnerable' as far as covid 19 is concerned. My question is, does the dose make a big difference? I am a health care worker and currently have reached 8mg, almost at 7.5, using dsns. I only work 2 days a week but am planning to continue doing so. I wonder if I should be staying at home - I just don't like to let others down. 8 mgs is almost the same as my body would produce so maybe I am not immunosuppressed??? Any thoughts please?

"My (now) 77 year old husband George reduced his Pred to 5 mgs by last September, and he has continued (without trouble except tiredness) with that dose for 6 months.
He saw his rheumatologist here in France last week. She's given him a new prescription, for Pred at 4 and a half mg, and now also Hydrocortisone at 10 mg . He is to continue another 6 months with these 2 drugs - but to gradually reduce the Pred further.

"Not very often a person writes about a successful tapering, so I decided to post my story. When Eileen describes the DSNS method of tapering prednisone, she writes about a Swedish gentleman who found out a tapering method, which Eileen et al developed further into the DSNS method. That Swedish gentleman is me – Ragnar.
After a week´s trip to Athens the first week in April 2005 (at the age of 67), I felt very strange and had a dry cough. After two weeks I went to the doctor. After blood work, he couldn´t tell what was wrong but made a plan where he step by step eliminated possible diseases. After some months without a real diagnose, I was sent to the medicine department of a main hospital. I had some new blood work, and then they told me that I had better have a biopsy in a temple. The problem was that I had two trips abroad coming up. I got an appointment after the first one and a biopsy showed that I had what they had expected. I was told I had pmr but they didn´t tell me I also had GCA, so I heard about that later.
I was put on 20 mg Prednisone (which is too low as a starting dose for GCA – but the subsidizing doctor didn´t see in the papers that I had GCA, I think. The next day I flew to the USA to participate in a class reunion after 50 years from graduation as an exchange student in a small town in Minnesota. My wife covered my white bandaid in the temple with skin-coloured surgical tape, so it shouldn´t show so much, especially not on the class picture. After about a week´s trip, while travelling in California by rented car, my wife used the scissors of a Swiss army knife to cut the strings that they had sewn at the biopsy. She dipped the scissors in gin from a miniature bottle we had got on the Atlantic flight – to sterilize it. Due to the cortisone, I felt great/high and on the national day of the USA, 4th of July, we walked downtown without problems. The brochure said the motel was in midtown, near downtown. I think we had to walk 20 blocks and then back – but I felt great even if my wife got tired despite being in better condition than I – the dose of pred helped me.
I reduced the pred by 2.5 mg every 3-4 weeks until I reached 10 mg. Then I reduced by 1 mg every month until I reached 5 mg. I tried to reduce during a whole year, but every time I had to go back to 5 mg due to fatigue. I thought it was no idea to go around being tired all the time when I didn´t have to. 5 mg is a fairly low dose. Unlike most persons with pmr, I had fairly little pain. When I had slight pain, it could be anywhere in legs or arms. After a year, I thought I would test a new regime that I had found out. After postng it, other pmr/GCA patients called it the Ragnar method. I took the lower dose 1 day, the old dose 2 days and repeated this once more. After about a week I took the step and lowered the dose each day. By doing this, my body reacted positively and I could start going down below 5 mg but only about 0.5 mg at a time. I had 2.5 mg tablets and cut them by hand in four parts, so it really was 0.6 mg at a time. If there was a problem, I just continued 1 day low dose, 2 days old dose for another week or so.
After 3 ½ years – in the middle of December 2008 – I got down to 0 and I haven´t had any problems after that – now it is 11 ½ years after coming off pred. I did some travelling shortly after coming off pred – we were for instance a week in Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh and a short trip to the Highlands). I just took it easy when we walked and when we visited a museum I just sat down to have a rest while my wife did it more thoroughly. Taking care of a friend´s dog keeps me busy and also makes me walk a bit more than I would otherwise do.
I had reduced my weight about 6 kg before I had the diagnose and some time after I was up to the same weight as before, which I of course was sad about. I had a moon face for some time, but for a man it probably isn´t as bad as for a woman. My advice is not to try to reduce too fast, especially not below 5 mg when every 1 mg (preferrably 0,5 mg) reduction is a very high reduction in percentage. My belief is that it is better to feel well and take the disadvantages a bit longer, especially when reaching doses of 5 mg and under. I am of course grateful that I haven´t been in pain so badly as most of fellow pmr-sufferers have.
Now, in 2020 I weigh 12 kg less than before I started tapering in 2005. Some years ago, I used the 5:2 method and later I kept the weight and even reduced by eating the right things – fish, chicken etc and at the age of 82 I am glad about my weight.
Lesson: Don´t go too fast. Then you may get a flare and the time it takes may be longer than when you taper a lower amount.

"we are snowbirds who live in florida 6 months a year. yesterday they closed and locked all the buildings in our complex; only the outdoor sports areas (tennis, pickleball, etc.) are open(and empty). outdoor pools are limited as to visitors (we dont use them ever). so the question is do we drive across country to get home or shelter in place? lots of people are packing up and leaving, others are staying here.
i have bronchitis, a residual from the flu last month. i was checked last week for pneumonia but chest xray was clear, no temperature. just cough syrup was recommended. we think we are staying here, at least for now. grocery stores are empty at home in the midwest where we live; there is food here (for now), although no wipes, toilet paper or sanitizers, etc. it will probably get worse as reality/panic sets in.
i am just loathe to travel to motels, gas stations, restaurants, etc--a 3 day trip for us. the beaches are unbelievably crowded--kids on spring break who have no fear and no sense. we are planning to stay here, at least for awhile, but there is talk of closing interstates; of course motels are always risky, even in the best of times. im sheltering in; my cough scares people to death anyway. in the sunshine and heat at least i can sit outside, go for walks, talk to passersby, etc. but florida has lots of vulnerable old people, lots of silly spring breakers, lots of cases of coronavirus in the state. at home we would be very isolated in our subdivision, much more than here, which is why a lot of people are heading out asap...to get away from the crowds. thoughts on car travel?

"Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with PMR 4 weeks ago. My rheumatologist put me on 20 mg of prednisone for 4 weeks, reducing to 15 mg , then to 5 mg until I return for my next visit in April. Last night I had severe leg cramps, Not just in the calves, but my entire leg. I have never had this before. Is this a side effect of the Prednisone? Before being diagnosed, I was in severe pain with major stiffness in pretty much all my joints. Very difficult to get out of bed and walk in the mornings. I just thought it was old age. I have always been a fairly active woman, and considered myself a young 67. But by the time I was 68, I felt I had aged 10 years. After 1 week on the prednisone I felt like a new woman. I don't feel quite as good now as I did 3 weeks ago, and will start reducing my dosage today. Is that normal? The information on this site has been so helpful. Thanks in advance for any information you my have on this matter.

have you seen any specific recommendations for those of us on >10mg per day prednisone and >60 years of age in what to do to reduce the risks of contracting this new virus?

"Hello. I am a 50 y.o. female in US. After 25 years of ongoing muscle pain (diagnosed a few years ago as fibromyalgia), I started having new and different pain and muscle weakness (both sides equally) just over 2 years ago..... first in arms, then progressing to legs. Really bad at first, then off and on a bit. Today, I have worsening muscle pain/tightness in shoulder joints and upper arms and hips/thighs. I also get very fatigued and weak. I really thought this sounded like PMR, but my rheum. doesn't think so because of sed rate and ESR (normal). (I've had extensive bloodwork and the only thing that comes back is postive ANA.) My primary dr. disagrees and thinks she should try the steroid treatment (but doesn't want to step on toes). Rheum started me on plaquenil (2 weeks ago) instead b/c of a sister who had possible lupus years ago. I am at a loss, and getting worse. Some days so hard to function b/c of weakness. No relief from rest, but unable to do much. I know you all know the frustration. Just reaching out to see if these symptoms are similar to yours. Thanks so much.

"Lots of discussion on this site about whether to take ibuprofen or naproxen for periodic pain. Some comment that one should never take these two pain killers because 1) they don't help or 2) they don't interact well. Read earlier today that if either of these drugs (also referred to as NSAIDs) work for you, you don't have PMR.   So when some of you ""flare"" there is a tendency to increase the amount of prednisone as the antidote.
i am interested in your experience here. I have found that both ibuprofen and naproxen help a lot with the pain from periodic flares, and particularly at night.  I have not had any adverse reactions in any form.  I have resisted increasing the prednisone because I don't want to start tapering all over again.

so when i first got the swollen veins/arteries, i thought they were due to the myofascial pain acting up. and once in the night when the pain let up, the veins almost disappeared.
i have no other symptoms of gca. but today flu and all im seeing an opthamologist. i just am physically unable to go to er where i would have to wait 5 hours before being seen. my fever is gone so maybe hopefully im not too contagious.

Maybe not really 60%, closer to 50. I can sometimes put one foot into the car first versus having to sit first with my feet on the ground then assist a leg up to the floorboard. I can always pull the car door shut which I had to do in stages for a while, I can pull my hose across the yard, turn water on and off = do many things I could not do in the thick of it.

I have been on the exceptionally slow reduction plan again & was thrilled that after almost ten years i had reduced to 4.5mg & really was so thrilled that PMR might have left me a.one at long last but after about three weeks the extreme pain reared its ugly head again.
I have increased it up to 6 mg but with little effect so should i increase more with yet another slow reduction or stick with 6 to see if it settles down?
I feel so disheartened as i really thought i'd cracked it!!
Maybe i must just not reduce below say 5MG?
i really would appreciate your help as im clearly not administering the steroids very efficiently!
Many thanks, Jane

"my sympthoms r very simple,i get huge muscle soreness after small use of muscle
for example right now i am able to walk about 40 minutes per day,and if i would walk 1 hour my legs would have muscle soreness for 5 days
if i would do 10 push ups my chest would be sore for 3 days
i tried eating more proteins,stretching,massasging my muscles,cold showers,eating glutamin,eating magnesium but nothing helped at all
i went to hospital and they did multiple tests on me,but every test turned out to be fine
i googled my simpthoms and there came results like ""chorinical fatugue syndrome"" which is not my case becase chronical fatigue syndrome is when somebody is felling tired without any reason,i am having muscle soreness only if i did more movement than i did the day before,and by ""movement"" i mean walking more than 40 minutes
also the resaults were some disease that cause muscle loss,i do lose muscle but it is because i am unable to use them
i am not very weak,i think i would be able to walk for 5 hours but i get muscle soreness after walking more than 40
in other words i get soreness without even geting tired nor giving my maximum effort
also i suffer from depression,and i though it could be somatoform disorder but my psychoterpaist said that it isnt
i am 23 yo,174cm tall and i weight 65 kg
does anybody know anything about this disease or could give me any advice what to do about it ?

"Hi, I wondered if it is common to feel a lot more tired and in need of more sleep when reducing. I have reached 8mg using dsns (much to the annoyance of my rheumatologist). This is my 3rd attempt to get to 8mg and it seems to be successful, hurrah - in that I am not particularly stiff and would not say I have any recurrence of symptoms (unlike my previous 2 attempts). I have noticed however that I do not have anywhere near the same energy levels (they are manageable but I would prefer more). I have been at 8mg for 9 days now and will wait another week or so before I start dsns down to 7.5mg. I was diagnosed May 2018 and started on 15mg. Thanks for your input.

"Hi everyone
I haven't got pmr, at least I was told that about a year ago by a rhuematologist. I was told I had osteoarthritis in my neck and spine. I'm 58.
Seven months ago I had a steroid injection in my right shoulder for tendonitis. The pain is back, along with neck pain and many other symptoms, headaches, dizziness, anxiety included. I also reduced my Citalopram dose 10 months ago because I take so many pain killers and I know I have been getting withdrawal symptoms from that.
My question is, can you get withdrawal symptoms after a steroid injection has stopped working? My withdrawal symptoms from citalopram seem to have become worse since my shoulder pain came back, hence the reason for the question. I hope it's not a ridiculous question.
I hope you don't mind me gate crashing your forum, I've asked this question on others too, but I'm desperately looking for answers about the way I feel and I'm hoping someone knows the answer to this. Thank you.

"Hi everyone. Just been to see my Rheumy doctor for my 6 monthly check up. I am currently on 4mg for the last month, and doing fairly well. No pain or stiffness above waist height, but stiffness with no pain from hips to knees. However have had chest pain and palpitations for quite a few weeks now, and because of this she sent me for various checks whilst I was at the Hospital; ECG which was OK, chest x-ray haven't got the result from that yet, ESR is 7 and PMR is 18 so a little bit high, also have to go for a gastroscopy in 4 weeks time. I am pretty sure the chest pain is caused by two and a half years of taking steroids, and I was advised to double up on my omeprazole tablets, which I have been doing for the last two weeks. Any advise on what else I can do? I have previously had sarcoidosis so wondering if this could be causing stiffness in y hips and knees. Thanks.

"I am probably going to be prescribed steroids this week after weeks of 'refusing' this as an option. The pain has won! I realise I have so much to learn and want to have as many facts as possible when I have the discussion with my GP, who has been remarkably supportive and a great listener. I have just rejjalised that two drugs seem to be mentioned as the common ones prescribed for PMR, Prednisolone and Prednisone. Reading this forum, I appreciate that the PMR journey is a personal one for every sufferer but can anyone shed light on the difference between these two drugs and offer any advice on preference?

"So the saga continues... The other day I remembered that I had stopped taking Excedrin Migraine for my chronic lower back pain. And I switched over to just taking Tylenol. Excedrin Migraine has aspirin in it and it dawned on me that maybe that was what was keeping my inflammation down. So I took another dose of Excedrin Migraine and within hours my PMR pain was better. So now I'm wondering if I ever stopped having PMR or if the aspirin was doing as good as the half milligram of steroids was doing when I finally tapered off. Or maybe this inflammation is not PMR and my rheumatologist is right and it's inflammatory arthritis. I did report this finding to my rheumatologist who just said that she was glad it was working. I would love any insight from anyone.

"I've mentioned here a few times that my prednisone dosage requirement seemed to change a good deal every year between the colder and hotter months, and I'd noticed that no one else here seemed to experience the same effect.
The seasonal effect has been that during the summer months, my dosage requirement has typically been at least 50% higher than during the winter months, and which I had attributed to air quality differences.
Today I think that I finally figured out what was really going on.
I had recently received a new bottle of prednisone by mail, just as I always do, and have been using the new pred for a couple of days now.
I have been noticing that this new pred has me feeling much more energetic and with a much stronger appetite, much like my pre-pmr days.
I realize now that the mailbox where these bottles are delivered can get very hot during our California summer months, and that a bottle delivered there likely sees temperatures up around 120F (49C) or higher at midday. My own mailbox also happens to be on the top row in one of those metal ""cluster"" mailboxes, so would also heat up the fastest.
So I just wanted to bring this issue of ""medication degradation"" to everyone's attention, as I will from now on definitely be picking up my medication in person whenever I am needing to order a refill during warm weather, so as to protect it from the intense heat.

"Hi everyone.
i haven’t been posting, but have been following the PMR board.
Was feeling good till 4 months ago, when I started getting fatigue dry mouth, unstable, stomach aches, etc.
after tests, the diagnosis leaned toward hypercalcemia, caused by active sarcoidosis,( which I was diagnosed with six years ago)
They also thrrew in chronic kidney disease, stage 3. assuming a sarcoidosis flare up.
The recommendation was 60 mg prednisone per day for a month and then drop down to 50 mg.
I started 40 mg, last Thursday and after reading lab notes, noticed a largely surpressed parathyroidhormone results, and would like to pursue that befor taking hi doses of prednisone.
simply stated finally. I would like to come off the prednisone thatI just started, and more thoroughly investigate the parathyroid gland, as the culprit.
You guys know everything.. Can I taper within the few days (i took 20 mgs, today), without flaring up

"Hi there
I've been on this forum for a while and always read the posts. Now I need some help and advice. I've been on the PMR journey for 6 1/2 years now , having experienced all the flares and yo -yo ing with my dosage. I thought I am fairly stable until now with this recurring pain on my LEFT shoulder, upper arm and neck. And there is this tingling / pins and needles sensation down my arms which happens periodically . The pain is constant, like jabbing , piercing sort of sensation. It will go away for a while when I move about and stretch, but it will come back. I have this now for the last 3/4 months. But it seems to get more severe this last 3/4 weeks. It gives me a better night sleep when I take -Co-codymol. The Ibuprofen or Paracetamol don't seem to have much pain relief. Using the DSNS method , i am presently taking 5mg.I had a flare up in April 2019 when I had to go up to 15 mgs, but gradually I managed to come back down to 5mgs.Now I don't know what to do,! Do you think this is a flare, or could it be something else? It is the throbbing pain on my upper arm , neck and shoulder and the tingling which made me doubtful of something else. Could I have a ""nerve trap""?Shall i go up my Pred? if so, how much and for how long ?The pain is affecting my sleep ! All your experience and advice will be much appreciated, especially Eileen's .Hope you all have a good day.

"It seems I get one injury or another when I either try to increase certain activities or try something new. I recognize the ""go slow"" concept but I have different issues than the average person. Specifically almost total spinal instrumentation to sacrum. This means my hips don' t ""swing"" like the average person and my pelvis muscles seem to tighten and I get bursitis OFTEM.
In November my excellent Physio and I tried increasing resistance on the Pilates performer machine. It felt wonderful because it stretched me out . A few days later I developed left butt pain worsened by sitting. I tried various liniments , heating/cold pacs, acetaminophen with variable relief but its not really getting better. My physio went on sick leave for open heart surgery due to a congenital issue so he doesn't even know. In the meantime I twisted my knee turning in bed. I consulted an orthopedist who felt the knee would heal in time - no severe damage. We agreed to do physio for both issues. I realize we have warnings about the damage an incompetent physio can wreak on a pmr person. My physio seems experienced, listens to my concerns and will modify exercised that seem to aggravate the issue. I seem to be tolerating 5 3/4 - 5 1/2 pred taper. It occurred to me that I might notice the injury more since it might have been masked by higher pred dosage.
Can anyone give me any tips that can be helpful?

The pain is waking me early morning 3am so being tired all the time is not helping either! I worry that I am addicted to steroids... Is this possible?

"I have gradually, using the slow method reduced to 4mg, which is great. Last time I reduced I had a lot of pain, and stiffness, so had to go back up from 2mg to 15mg. However this time at 4mg although I am stiff it is only between my hips and knees, and I have no pain. All other areas are ok without any stiffness or pain. My knees feel what I can only describe as tight as if I have got something tied around them, and this makes it difficult getting in and out of the bath-not keen on showers! I did go up to 10mg for two days, which did help with the stiffness, and then came back to 4mg. Thought I would stay at this level for some time to see if it settles down, but not sure. Just had a bone scan as well, which with my non-medical background looks as good if not better than a year ago. I see my Rheumy in two weeks time, so I will see what she thinks.

The pain in the sternum has been slowly getting worse over the last few weeks. When I sneeze the pain is indescribable.  It feels like I'm breaking something. The last doctor visit I had, the doc said is sounded like costochrondritis, but how can I have inflammation there when I've been on such high doses of prednisone since the summer?

"Does anyone else get pain around their collarbone? Sometimes it's just like a small patch of almost a burning pain just below my collarbone, and at other times it seems as if my actual collarbone is inflamed.
I have always had a touch of this since getting PMR just over eighteen months ago, but this last few days it has felt worse. This is possibly connected with the fact that I have just reduced from 6mg to 5mg - and because I was feeling so well (I was convinced the PMR had gone because I had had no symptoms at all for a week or so) I reduced in a week rather than four or five.
Or, of course, it could be something else entirely. My rheumatologist is keeping an open mind about the PMR diagnosis so with any symptom that is not classic PMR I tend to start worrying about RA or some other form of inflammatory arthritis.
Does anyone else have collarbone pain?

I've had 2 cycles of PMR with a side of RS3PE , one at 53 y/o (undiagnosed) and another diagnosed at 64 years old. Remission after about 1.5 years, but now, take about 5-10 mg pred per MONTH in 1 mg dosage to supress some swelling from RS3PE and pain.

I will be having a double knee replacement on 12 February 2020, both are bone on bone.

"I've been prescribed Prednisone for my ulcerative colitis with 40 mg per day with 5 gms tapering off per week for 4 weeks. The first two weeks I could cope up well but since the past few days (3rd week) when I'm on 30 mg a day I'm feeling extremely drained out and especially annoying is the blurred vision and fatigue leading to minor diplopia. I've asked the doc for advise and he has told me to switch the timing of the steroid in the mornings vs end of day.
Is there anything that can help? any advise?

"Good evening,
wishing all site participants a Happy and Healthier New Year to all.
please can someone remind me of the optimal way to reduce down from 30 mg? I've reduced from 2 wks at 60 mg in 5 mg stages and from 35 - 30 mg I've adjusted over 1 weeks. plan to stay at 30 mg for a weeks as some breakthrough inflammation. Should the next stage be reduced in 2.5 mg increments?
Aim is to get to <20 mg asap as have lots of pred related side effects such as sweats, glucose in urine and can't sleep for more than 5-6 hours per night and feeling quite diminished in myself.
very best wishes

"I am on 6 mgm pred. A few weeks ago I PULLED A MUSCLE IN MY LEFT BUTTOCK which is annoying but manageable. All of a sudden, after feeling quite well and pain free this morning my other hip became so stiff and I have now trouble walking. I feel rather achy in shoulders pelvis. I did not do any special exertion but last night significantly short of sleep. I suspect a budding flare and added 5mgm pred extra this evening. Sounds right? I thought I would see if this helps and take the extra 5mgm 3 days or so going back to 6 mgm 1 mgm at a time over as many days.

"To-day, the 13th of December is the Lucia Day in Sweden. Lucia is the queen o lights and she comes to us with lights during the darkest period of the year. In every city, they have an official Lucia and it is a very honorable thing to become the Lucia. In schools, every class has a Lucia and she also has Star Boys as attendants. If you want to know more about the Lucia celebration, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucy%27s_Day and https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/lucia/ As the Nobel Prize winner always are in Sweden during the Lucia celebration, they were at least in earlier days woken up with a Lucia entering their rooom singing the Lucia song. It was said that one old man (as you know, most laureates are old) woke up and thought he as in heaven and that angels were singing for him.
It is now 11 years ago that I came off pred after having had pmr and GCA. I chose to say December 13th as the Lucia Day is easy to remember. I stayed on 5 mg for a year due to fatigue. After that I tried a new regime with one day new dose, two days old dose and repeated that 2-3 times. This way I got off pred without problems and without flares. Later, somebody called it Ragnar´s Method and many tried it and also got off pred. Then Eileen H et al made a new method where the period going over to the new dose was stetched out even more. This was called the DSNS (dead slow nearly stop) method and very many have tried it with success. When I started posting many years ago there were also groups in the US and Canada but unfortunately, those other groups stopped being on internet. In the UK group in the Northeast, I was one of those who posted their stories and I think it was very interesting to see how different we had been acting and how different we had gone through to Zero pred. At one time, I started Club Zero on the Northeast Forum and it was nice to see how many that became members as they stopped taking pred. Now I look at the posts in patient.info when there is a discussion where I think I can help with an opinion.
With the Lucia celebration, let us look forward to the lighter period and also a better period of taking pred. There is a light at the end of the tunnel!!!
(My first name is Ragnar and I had pmr and GCA for 3 1/2 years)

"I am eternally grateful to this forum and I want to thank everyone for sharing their journeys. I am now splitting my Prednisone (thanks to someone who posted this on this forum) and I am now person. Previously I took it all in the morning and every single morning was a painful experience for me until the afternoon when I felt much better. I can now exercise in the morning which was previously much too painful and I can drive the car safely as I can now turn my head with a much reduced discomfort. I am currently reducing to 11 mg from 11.5 and I am now more hopeful I will reach that 5 mg marker maybe in a year or so.
In closing, thank-you for this very very useful tip. My doctor will be informed big time about this extremely useful advice for her PMR sufferers.
Happy New Year to all

"I have been to see my Rheumy this morning and left feeling very frustrated. He admits that he does not know what my diagnosis is. He even asked if I had any suggestions! He wont have it that I have Polymyalgia saying I am too young and can I send him the research that says otherwise. So here I am asking if there is any research I can send him?
He is thinking of doing a PET scan and is doing a test for Limes, I think he is clutching at straws.
I have been told to stop the Simponi injection I was on which is great as I am sure it was having no effect and can't have been good for me. I am on 14mg of steroids and am reasonably stable at the moment, I do have pain in my shoulders but it it just there rather than incapacitating and a strange pain in my back bone near the top. If I touch my shoulders or my back it actually hurts under pressure. They have tested for bursitis and it is not that.
My plan is to reduce steroids really slowly over the next 3 months before I see him again but would like to be able to back with more information next time.
Thank you as always for your help and support.

"I am on 6MGM pred. I was lowering the evening dose and was taking 5 mgm in the morning and 1MGM at night. I found that I felt really tired in the morning but very peppy evenings. I'm trying now 2.5 evenings the rest of the dose mornings. I seem to feel better most of the day. How low the dose before once a day dosing? It seems, in my case , there is a delay before maximum result. I do put my pred in capsules , weekly, to help keep track of doses (and not drop pills on the floor).

"Hi, I’m an active 59 yr old man who is currently on 4.5mg of Prednisolone for PMR. I have been tapering from 15mg since mid June this year :6 months. I am taking multi-vitamin supplement and drink lots of milk , cheese, eggs etc. My spine is osteopenic -1.5 (August).
Unfortunately I came off my bike yesterday and broke my clavicle and ribs. I also have a running injury to my knee. The Prednisolone i am taking may have contributed to the fractures and will also slow and prevent bone healing. Should I therefore quickly taper off the Prednisolone and risk a PMR flare and suffer stiffness and inflammation until my collarbone and knee have healed? I don’t want to take Alendroic acid as I have very bad teeth and frequent extractions and have also heard of other bad side effects. Taking it not have any effect for 6 monthsanyhow. I have also researched the effects of low dose Pred on bone healing and several studies have shown that doses 2.5 to 5mg do have a rapid effect on bone strength and increase fracture risk by 70% as well healing.

"its been a while since i posted anything but as I've just reached the 2 year point on pred I thought I'd give a quick update on how things are going, Last time I posted I'd had my first PMR relapse and had to go back to 8mg pred from 5. That was January 19. I've reduced slowly over this year and am now down at 2.5mg with no pain or stiffness at all and preparing to reduce slowly to 2mg. The only symptom i do seem to get when reducing is fatigue and while i am pain free i still don't have the energy or stamina I had before this started. I'm optimistic now that an end maybe in sight, but do others find fatigue and lack of energy persist?
I had a bad cold 2 weeks ago, it lasted about 4 days with flu like symptoms including headache and mild temperature I felt quite ill fir a couple days. All better now except the headache which seems to me the usual one I get with colds/flu or if really overtired - centre forehead and behind eyes - comes and goes and paracetemol and esp. iboprufen relieve it completely. Doesn't sound like beginnings of GCA to me and i have no other symptoms but what do others think, has anyone found that colds and flu seem to last longer with PMR? Generally I've avoided infections in the last year except this one virus.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in 2015 . Classic symptoms, pain in shoulders and hips. Initially on 30mg and still found getting up stairs difficult in the morning. Later on in day I would feel fine and a bit of fraud but next morning hard to move again. On Eileen's advice I started to take my dose at about 4.00 in the morning. This changed my life and made an enormous difference. I kept to this regime for the next four years and gradually tapered down with occasional hicups on the way. I would say that for the last year or more I had no symptoms but following advice on this forum and elswhere I tapered down very gradually so not to risk either a flare up or too sudden withdrawal from Prednisone. Travelling seemed to bring on symptoms and I would have to increase dose for a while. I finished taking Prednisone in March shortly before having a knee replacement. The timing of this op was partially to coincide with finishing Prednisone. Apparently it is better not to be taking steroids whilst having major op. During my recovery from knee op I've been having problems with stiffness and pain, not in the classic PMR places but in my fingers and legs. It is worse in the morning, but can last all day. It responds quite well to Ibroprufin. I have had tests for inflamation and the results were slightly higher than normal. My doctor said that if it is PMR then I should take Prednisone again. My surgeon said it was either PMR or arthritis and now I am no longer taking Prednisone I am noticing symptoms. He also said the Pred was probably masking knee pain I would have has before my knee op. So, am I now suffering from mild PMR and if so what dose of Pred should I take? Should I just start at 1mg and increase until symptoms go away? I need my hands, I am a mountain guide and strong fingers are essential. On some mornings I can't even open a milk bottle! Or, am I barking up the wrong tree and it is not PMR despite my history with the disease. Or, is it just the normal aches and pains of growing older (I am 64)? My fellow Swiss guides say ""if you wake up one morning, and nothing hurts, you're probably dead!""

"A really silly question I know, as each maintenance dose is obviously individual, but I wondered if you would mind sharing your maintenance dosage? I am again really struggling having dropped ( very slowly to 6.5 ) on recommendation of my lovely GP who wants me to keep challenging myself.
My hands are so uncomfortable, I hobble like a really old lady and the arm itching is keeping me awake for a large proportion of the night! OH quite rightly is encouraging me to go back up and I do remember last year Eileen, when I was desperate you said you were on 9mg.
I am reluctantly coming to the conclusion that I need to concentrate more on a maintenance level rather than insane drive to get off pred .
I am beginning to wonder that for me at least that I need to be even slower than everyone else or just reach and stay at a level that makes life ok!
Would love to hear you valuable comments.

""b"" does not use forums and is not very internet savvy, although she is (was) a nurse so she is fairly knowledgeable about health issues.
b is currently taking 1/2 mg pred every 4 days. she says her muscles and range of motion have greatly improved but she just feels unwell all over, unhealthy, she says. i tried to talk her into going back up to say 1/2 mg pred every other day and staying there for a year to allow her adrenals to catch up, she wouldnt hear of it. i talked to her about the possibility of adrenal catchup, adrenal insuffientcy, sluggish adrenals, all which she is aware of. i told her 1/2 mg every other day is a minimal amount, that her body might just need it to function.
can you all please tell me what tapering plan b should be on? what do you think might work best to get her back on track? thank you.

"Hello,
I haven't been on this forum for a while, due to various health issues, a house move and still coming to terms with a family loss.
I was diagnosed with Pmr 2016, I received a lot of support and advice from many people here.
This year I managed to reduce prednisone from the original 15mg to 9mg.
Failed again in October and had to increase to 10mg then 12.
I have been in so much pain, reduced mobility and chronic fatigue I am on my 3rd day of 15mg.
My question is, how long should I stay on 15mg, and do I reduce to 14, or 12mg.
At my wits end and this nightmare illness is managing me and not the other way round.
Apologies for rambling on, but I have seen 4 rhematologist's all as dismissive as each other.
Any advice would be appreciated.
I hope you are all as well as you can be.

"In the USA we just had our Thanksgiving holiday and it's a time when I like to take a look at my life and remind myself of what I have to give thanks for - even in bad times.
3-1/2 years ago my body had been attacked by an unknown demon. In 4 months time I had gone from being a very physically active 61 year old working 50+ hours a week, doing evening and weekend projects, etc to a person who struggled to get dressed and somehow make it through the work day. Being in a vehicle was so painful that I would have to get out every 15-20 minutes to walk around for a few minutes so I could continue. Doctors weren't coming up with any answers and I feared that this unknown demon was going to keep me in this condition or worse for the rest of my life. I was truly terrified. While having more testing done, a physician's assistant suggested that I might have an auto immune disorder and got me a prescription for a week's worth of Prednisone. PMR - the demon had a name. That alone was a comfort. And, as they say, the rest is history.
Life's not perfect - it's not easy working but I've learned to listen to my body. I miss the way I was but am still thankful for what I am now. I haven't had a flare in 2 years, just made it to 5mg/day and for certain give thanks for that! I'm not rushing to reduce. And especially I'm thankful for Prednisone and for this web site and one other site like it. I can't imagine fighting this demon without the drug or without the wise counsel of others here. And for that I am eternally thankful.
We all hope to kill the demon and consign him to a memory of some tough times. This site plays an amazingly important part in dealing with PMR and I am thankful for each and every person here. Be blessed.

"I was taken off 5mgs. of Pred. in September because I was having aches and pains when trying to taper to 4mgs. and put on Hydrocortisone as I had the test and although my Adrenals are producing cortisol, it wasn't enough. Iv'e posted before that Hydro. pushed my B/P up, so my Rheum. and the Endo. Consultant cut out the last 5mgs. making 15mgs. a day dose. My B/P has fallen since (my B/P tablets were also increased). I then started getting niggly aches and pains, backache, pains above my hip, arm and leg pain etc. My regular Rheum. couldn't fit me in so I saw another lady who was very nice, examined me thoroughly and brought her colleague in and they both agreed The symptoms were not a sign that the GCA was returning. My markers (which took over 3yrs. to drop) have gone from 5 to 15 recently. I was sent for a chest x-ray and further blood tests. They asked if I had any recent infections and I said no, (the only recurring thing I have is the symptoms of a cold, which never appears). Anyone else had anything similar? (When I say my markers took 3yrs. to drop, I mean of course they went from 121 to 5 in 3yrs. I started at 40mgs. of Pred in 2015)

"Hi Folks, In 2013 I was diagnosed with PMR and treated via Prednisone and got through it.
I also have some minor osteoarthritis and maintain with Plaquinil.
I don't remember much of the details about the 1st bout, I did not diet accordingly or participate on a forum, I just got through it, its a blur.
Now however its back, I'm taking 15mg prednisone a day at once with a meal and the improvement is slow, its only been a week. But my right shoulder in the AM is grueling with the left threatening to follow suit. The hips are improved over before taking the pred.
I take it @noon (I work afternoons and sleep in a little). I have noticed it wears off sooner and takes longer to help, like 3hours . Maybe I need to give it more time? I have notes sent in to my Dr.
Other than the info above I need some diet tips. I have read the do's and don't elsewhere but would like to hear what kind of cereals you guys use and hear some shopping tips. How and on what do you stock up?
How much sugar is acceptable in a single serving as read on the box?

"I have been on steroids for about 4 years following a diagnosis of polymyalgia. I had wet macular in my right eye at least two years before that and have been having leucentis injections to hold it back until last July when I had a mini stroke. As my sight had seriously deterioated I havn't had any more injections. I was down to 4 mg pred and had a bad flare up, my first, about a month ago and the doctor put my up to 10 mg. However sadly now I believe my macular degeration has started in my good eye (seeing the hospital tomorrow). Does anyone else have the combination of pmr and macular. I feel it may be the rise in the steroids that has triggered it off as its quite a coincidence. Now I probably will have to make the decision to start injections again and risk a stroke to save my sight. Its a hard decision to make. Any information from this group would be appreciated.

"After seeming to get somewhere with this at the beginning of the year I now feel as sore as I did right back at the beginning of this journey in 2016 and I am now 51. As a recap - First the doctor said it was Polymyalgia and put me on steriods where I got relief to about 80% of my pain. Then the Rhumy disagreed and decided I has Axiel Spondoloropthy (sorry for spelling) as I was to young for PM and said because of my diagnosis of Oestoperosis that I had to come off the steriods and put me on humiura. I was slowly reducing the steriod and on the humiura and was doing well. Then I went away on holiday to New Zealand this February. It was fabulous but all my medication went to pot and I have not been good since. I changed Rhumy due to change of address and he now says that he does not think the diagognosis of AS is right and now insisting I get off the steriods completely, currently I am on 3mg, and has moved me onto Simponi which is injected once a month and may take 12 weeks to kick in. I take my 3rd injection on Saturday.
Where I am at now. I am in constant pain in my shoulders, which runs down my arms with certain movements. I find it difficult to put on my clothes or tie my hair up. My neck and upper back are painful too. My hips are in a bad way and it hurts to walk up the stairs or to crouch down. Sleeping is only on my back as any other position really hurts. I take co-codamol to help me get to sleep, I don't think it helps the pain it just relaxes me so I can drift off. I do get to sleep and often wake in the night but try to go back to bed but if I move I wake in pain. When I am up and moving is better and I work which does take my mind off it a little.
Ok so what is my question. I need to get my quality of life back but don't know what to do about it. I am waiting to see the Rhumy again I hope in September where I think I will be telling him that Simponi does not work. He will then try me on something else that may take 12 weeks to work, am I just supposed to put up with this pain for another 12 weeks and on, whilst we go through all the different drugs? What if it is PM and steriods are the only solution? How can I prove this? If you were going to be sitting in front of the Rhumy soon what would you be saying?
I know there are lots of you out there who are much worse than me and I thank you in advance for your support.

"Hi Eileen, took your advice and asked GP to refer me for Synacthen test. She said she's never referred anyone before but she's very nice and always complies. Now have to see if hosp will do one on NHS and if not will have to fork out. Dizziness caused by having to stand too long in church. Sitting next time. Fine now.

"This is my 2nd bout with PMR since 2013.
Tell me if any of you have experienced Hamstring sore or stiffness in the weeks preceding the Shoulder & Hip discomforts.
Weeks before my 1st bout my hamstrings felt like they needed stretching all the time. But stretching them did not gain any ground.
For instance when you start sessions twice or more a day and cannot touch your toes, in a week or so you should be able touch them. As time goes on you can grab your foot with both hands.
But with me it never improved or gained any flexibility.
Then it stopped when the classic shoulders and hips took over. I went to the Dr.... History............
So its back and the same thing happened. Anyone else? Thanks

"It's almost a year since my PMR diagnosis and at 13 mg Prednisone, my blood work is showing improvements ESR is 11 and C Reactive Protein is 17.7. These are the lowest counts I have had so far. I reduced to 12 mg 2 days ago and will hope the counts behave (hopefully keep going down) when I see the next monthly blood test counts. I was hoping the morning joint pains would improve more quickly but I still resort to Tylenol #3 most mornings.
QUESTION
Do my counts for ESR and C Reactive Protein have to be in the normal ranges before the pain is eliminated or at least reduced to a more tolerable level?

"I'm coming up on 5 years since PMR diagnosis next week. I was down to 2 mg. Medrol in May, and held there as I had my Right Hip replaced on May 20th. Once the pain from the surgery resolved and I started to move around and do the stairs, I felt some pain in the right knee. Since it was only one side, I figured it was related to the surgery, or overdoing the stairs. I had blood drawn maybe 8 wks after the surgery, and even got to about 1.75 mg Medrol, but went back to 2 mg. since it was difficult with both knees going down the stairs, and I was stiff in all the usual PMR places, especially in the AM until the Medrol kicks in. I tried 3 mg. with no real improvement, and now I'm finishing a week at 4 mg. and not really much better. I suppose I need to up the dosage again, but that's really discouraging!!! Your collective wisdom would be appreciated.

"Every day there are posts about persons who have had flares - sometimes very bad and painful.
I have been free from pmr and GCA for close to 11 years. I had no real pain when I stared tapering or during the tapering period, so I was lucky, I guess. When I got to 5 mg pred I felt fatigue and I decided to stay on 5 mg for a year. Then I found out a method to taper which has been called the Ragnar method. I therefore tested the following method: one day new dosage, two days old dosage and then I repeated it once more. After six days, I took the new dosage for a period and next time I wanted to taper, I repeated this method. At the time (almost 11 years ago), I was posting fairly frequently on the Northeast forum, so I posted my method there as I had been successful using it and wanted more people to be able to try it. Many other persons in different countries of the world tested it and mostly with success. Somebody started to call it the Ragnar method (Ragnar is my forename).
After some time, Eileen et al extended the period for the tapering and developed a method. It was called the DSNS (dead slow nearly stop) method, and even more people have been successful in tapering as the extended period was better for the body for many. I think that it is important to go very slow. To me, it was more important than getting off pred. As I was on 5 mg I thought I could just as well stay on that for a year as the fatigue bothered me very much. Now I have been off pred almost 11 years without having a flareup. By the way, I never had a flareup as I went very slowly. Eileen is doing a great job explaining how it works and she really has helped a lot of persons.
The idea is not to get off as soon as possible - then you probably have a flare and it takes longer than if you didn´t taper so fast. Just be patient and don´t hurry - it doesn´t pay. Use the DSNS method to have a taper without flares!

"First of all - apologies for many typos to come - doing this at speed
My PMR started in a non typical way - let's call this phase 1 - I has lots of pain and stiffness but mostly is lower body- though crept into upper body a little eventually. Did not come on suddenly but in creeping way. Loads of blood tests - showed nothing. Was still in 40s when symptoms started. Mobility difficulties but could still function.
PHASE 2 - came on overnight after a few years of the above. neck and shoulder hurt very badly - I thought maybe frozen shoulder. One sided at first but became bilateral. Went to physio and osteopath with no result. felt as if I had flu - etc. etc. Eventually could barely function - saw new GP - diagnosed with PMR.
Steroids seemed miracle cure.
Had a few l flares over the last couple of years but have managed them - they felt like a return to phase 1 as detailed above. Now have sudden onset neck and shoulder pain - cannot relate this to an injury. But I doubled my dose for a few days and it did not seem to help at all! At first I thought this meant it couldn't be PMR RETURNING as pred did not seem to help. But now I am wondering if I want that 0-20 effect I had initially - when the pain disappeared practically overnight - should I have gone even higher or for longer?
Thoughts appreciated.

"last week i went in for a simple MOHS procedure--a teensy tiny spot on my temple that was supposed to be a snip-snip, bandaid and done. 18 stitches later, i have a diagonal scar that extends from the corner of my eyebrow up into my hair (which they shaved off). i look like igor. needless to say, my pmr is ramped up wildly, which i knew it would, even from the predicted simple procedure, never mind the actual one.
i was at 5 1/2 mg pred and struggling with DF and lethargy and all kind of things before the surgery, so i went up to 10 mg. pred following the procedure. today is my 5th day at 10 mg. i still feel pretty awful--weak, fatigued, lousy. plus i think im reacting to the tylenol theyve had me take for pain--some people do. (i react to everything, long story). here is my question: what do i do now with pred? go back to 5 1/2? stay at 10 for few more days? (i get stitches out thursday) reduce by 1 mg day? im just afraid that 5 1/2 isnt gonna cut it. thank you.

"Hi All,
Recently I promised to come back and share my experience at MGH Boston, where I had a Thursday appointment with Rheumatology.
MGH is beyond compare, I already knew that. Going from the suburban dope of a rheumatologist I was working with to the expert and his Fellow at MGH just highlighted why this hospital is a Center of Excellence. (My family has been MA General patients for many different conditions. They saved my husband, who had a Dissecting Aortic Aneurysm at age 48.)
My doctor is a GCA Specialist, but able to treat all things rheumatology. And he does. He had a complete grip on my story of MS, Exzcema, GCA and PMR, through the electronic records. He did not say one negative word about my prior care. Class Act.
He has a lot to work on with me, and put pain first in line. The worst pain is in my hips and it started with the relapse. One simple hug of the hips and glutes and he knew it is bursitis. And right then and there he did cortisone shots to the outside joints (didn't send me down the road!). I will go back next week for shots to the back joints. (I cannot remember the names of which is which, but you know what I mean I think.) He's hoping that my 3 month high dose Botox treatments to my legs, for MS Spasticity, to be done this Thursday, will help with getting my gait straighter and thus help with the bursitis. The cortisone is just starting to kick in today, I look forward to tomorrow!
Once the Bursitis in the hips is resolved, he will have a plan for my screaming lower back.
All the while, he will be SLOWLY tapering me down from the 60 mg of Prednisone I am presently on. And, he will be educating and communicating with me weekly through his Fellow. What a novel idea. LOL.
He does want me to stay with the pain management center that has been treating me a with low dose Butran pain patch, as it can help with the bursitis (holy cow is that a painful thing!!!). He does not want me on it long-term and I don't want to be on it long term, but if it helps for now, and he approves, then it's OK with me.
So there I am. A good care plan in action. Am totally disgusted at having been slammed into a relapse in my first two months of this journey, due to over aggressive tapering by Rheum #1. But he's in the rear view mirror now and I'm moving on. Slowly. I still cannot walk very well and pain is a constant partner. But, I feel hopeful that this will not always be the case.
Fingers crossed.
Only tough thing about MGH is getting there, Boston traffic is now officially beyond ridiculous. Best way to get there is via commuter rail then either MGH shuttle bus or UBER from North Station.

"Hi all--I showed up here a mere 2 month ago. I am a 63 yo woman and I have Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis, and in June was diagnosed with PMR and GCA.
At the time I was diagnosed I was not in horrible condition, I had shoulder stiffness, fierce fatigue and ugly attitude. My PCP sent me to a rheum who she said ""this is the guy that will get you through this.""
Never has a statement been uttered that was more off base than hers. I was started on 60 MG Prednisone for the GCA, for one week. Then the rheum started tapering: 60 to 40 for 2 weeks; 40 to 30 for 2 weeks; 30 to 20 for I don't know how long.
As he was tapering, I was educating myself here about proper taper. And, I asked multiple times for a slower taper, all to know avail. He continued to say ""do as I instruct."" Stupid me, I did. All the while I was sending him notes and calling saying ""something is very wrong.""
3 weeks ago I went in for a regular appointment with fierce hip, glute, upper thigh and lower back pain. Worse pain than I've ever know, and I know pain. He ran bloodwork and my number were within range, but were trending up. I was at 30 mg, he dropped me to twenty. His statement ""Your numbers are within range.""
And that's when I saw the light. I was in a screaming loud relapse. I immediately put myself on 60 mg/day and was able to get an appointment with the Rheumatology group at Massachusetts General Hospital. I will be there this coming Thursday.
I am in so much pain, it has made me cry. One time it made me vomit. It feels as if every muscle from my knees to my lower back have been strained, pulled, damaged. I can barely walk, and that's only with a walker. I am in pain management for my MS and that doctor has prescribed a Butrans pain patch to see if he can at least quiet any MS pain that may be in the background. I have not gotten that yet, and probably won't try it until I see the new Rheum. I want to show up in the horrid condition I am in right now.
Two months with this clown and look what he has done to me. I feel as if I will never be the same. I feel as if I am losing it. I've been on 60 mg/day for 4 days and blessed relief has not yet arrived.
Please share with me your experiences with relapses. I need support, I need help. I am losing it bit by bit. Thank God for my husband, pets and knitting, they are what are keeping me going.

"saw gp today who treats my pmr. my blood pressure was 120/60. usually its around 120/70ish or so. nurse said no problem with diastolic reading of 60 if im not having symptoms, like fatigue, she said. well...yes, im having fatigue, lots of it, from the pmr/pred. (im at 5 1/2 mg pred, got pmr 09/16).
so here is my question: anybody have low diastolic bp along the pmr/pred/fatigue journey or is this something else for me to worry about? also, 10 years ago a doctor noticed that my diastolic blood pressure was lower as soon as i SAT DOWN--she had a name for it, which ive forgotten. ""wait 5 minutes, have the nurse take your bp again, it should come back up,"" she said. i always used to do that and sure enough, it came right back up. then the whole issue seemed to disappear altogether and my readings were normal. until today but i forgot all about asking the nurse to retake my bp.
would like to know whether anyone else has experienced low diastolic bp along with their fatigue. thanks,

"Just got back from a check-up at the dentist and everything passed with flying colors except for the gums. They bled easily when probed with that ""pointy"" tool they use.
The dental technician was puzzled because I had none of the symptoms that normally go along with bleeding gums (such as plaque).
Thinking about it afterward, I'm wondering if prednisone could be the cause. I know that pred users bruise easily. Can that logic be extended to bleeding easily?

"Hi! I just found and joined this group. I am 62, live in Canada and was diagnosed with PMR in January 2019 after about 7-8 weeks of agony. I was an avid Crossfitter and was really enjoying being fit and active until one day in mid-November, I woke up to the craziest neck and shoulder pain ever. After diagnosis, I was put on 15 mg of Prednisone and experienced the miracle of movement again after only a few days. I am currently on 10mg
Since then, I have been on and off active - running, hiking, cleaning garden and house and working part-time - but not doing Crossfit. In early June, my husband and I went on an extended road trip of about 13 hours (not all at once) and when I returned to my home, I found that my neck and shoulders were very sore again. I was scared that I might have to increase my dose of Pred. I was also getting increasingly alarmed about my weight gain of 14 lbs. and possibly becoming diabetic. I did some research and found some information about a Keto diet being helpful for auto-immune conditions. So I have been trying it. I'm finding it very difficult in some ways but in the end, my pain is gone and I feel pretty good again.
What I would like to know is if anyone else is using the Keto diet to help manage PMR and if so, what is your experience? Suggestions for what to eat would also be helpful since this is so new to me (3 weeks in). I would like to make this change as part of a new eating lifestyle. Looking for others on a similar quest.

"Early February 2019 I began having gait issues and pain in both shoulders. Sleeping became difficult due to the constant pain that was aggravated by lying down. The pain then began to travel down my arms and I was losing coordination in arms and legs. On February 20 I was unable to roll over and get out of bed. I was unable to lift my arms beyond chest level. When I tried to walk I was floppy, rocking back and forth and had ataxia. I was hospitalized and had brain MRI, CAT scan of brain , blood tests etc. I was treated for a neurological condition but they were unable to determine the cause.
This continued for many months and neurology told me it was stress. I continued to get sicker and was losing the use of my arms finding it difficult to do daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, cooking etc. Finally on June 25th I saw a Rheumatologist who diagnosed PMR. I was put on 20 mg of prednisone and felt immediate relief. The pain lessened, I was able to dress myself and the rocking motion improved.
After 3 weeks on 20 mg of prednisone , I went down to 15 mg for 3 weeks. I was just going to start 12.5 mg when headaches and jaw pain increased and my c-reactive protein and sed rate increased. The Dr. started me on 60 mg of prednisone immediately and five days later I had arterial biopsy on 8/13/19 that showed no inflammation of the artery. I was unable to tolerate the 60 mg so the Dr. quickly dropped me to 40mg, 30 and then 20mg within a few days. I continue on the 20 mg of prednisone but it appears to have compromised my immune system. My liver and kidney function tests are elevated, WBC elevated and immune tests are lowered. The Dr. said I am immune compromised and need to be very careful of infection. On 8/30/19 the Dr. called and told me I had a urinary tract infection based on urinalysis and she ordered ciprofloxacn 250mg twice a day. After speaking with the pharmacist and reading the patient insert I did not start the prescription due to the side effects of the drug.
I will see the Dr. on Tues. 9/3/19 to discuss new lab results, ultrasound of the liver ( fatty liver and gallstones) and how to deal with infection and being immune compromised. I would appreciate and thoughts or ideas on what I should ask the Dr about my condition. Dealing with PMR is difficult but the complications or side effects of the treatment is making this overwhelming.

"Last time at the pain clinic, the dr suggested I have an electric pain stimulator inserted in my back with leads that make the pain signals in my lower back turn off somehow. That's ok, if what I have is arthritis in my back, right? But does it work for polymyalgia, if I still have that, too? This is what happens to me repeatedly: I reduce my prednisone from 30 to 25 for three or four days and suddenly I'm in the worst pain, in spots above my hips and in my arms and shoulders. The pain pills have no help for that pain, though they help with other pains, only the pred. helps, if I take the greater amount. It is maddening. I have no answer and feel desperate.

"After suffering with symptoms for quite a while I was finally diagnosed with PMR in April 2016.
Started on 15 mg with dramatic results. In May of 2016, after a long trip caused a flare, I had to increase to 20 mg. Between now and then I have experienced multiple ups and downs while trying to taper.
Thought I was making progress during my current DSNS taper from 13.5 to 13. I am in the second phase of the taper where I am at 1 day old (13.5) and yesterday took the 3rd day of new (13 ). Was looking forward to taking 13 again this morning which would have been my 4th day of my new lower dose.
Sadly, when I woke up this morning I am in a lot of pain, am having difficulty moving, feeling nauseous and have an overall sense of feeling terrible.
I understand that PMR has a mind of its own and it will determine how/when my dose can be lowered, however, it's now been 3 years and I'm still at 13.5 !! My rheumy who is terrific has ruled out other possibilities and allows me to reduce at my own pace.
Feeling deflated that I can't make, what I would consider, satisfactory progress with at least getting to 10 mg. Am I missing something ?

I was diagnosed with PMR four years ago and have had some flare ups along the way. about year 2 I started having angina and increased blood pressure. Did poorly on a stress test and was given metropolol and nitro spray. Nothing showed up on dye test, but Doctors insist I have cardivascular disease. I am suspicious that its really PMR affecting my heart, but they don't agree. I have recently tapered off prednisone after the DSNS method and feel good. No angima for a year, blood pressure low. I want to get off the heart meds, but doctors don't agree. is there any current research showing a connection between PMR and cardiac problems?

"i never know what the day will bring. no matter how careful i am, how i do everything right, how i dont overexert myself, there are lots of days when i wake up and just feel terrible. sore, achey, weak, lethargic. its one thing to look back and say, ""well, i overdid it so im paying today."" nope, this is different, sometimes it just comes out of nowhere.
no, split dose doesnt make a difference, tried twice. no, its not a flare, its just feeling like a sick person for no apparent or at least a predictable reason. a day of rest and im usually back on track.
in the way of background, im at 5 1/2 mg pred where i intend to stay until at least oct. ive been on pred since sept 2016. im never pain free, never was, even from the earliest days. i have fatigue sometimes, but not always. well, im pretty worn out by bedtime, if not before,
do any of you have bad days too for no reason, or are you able to relate them to too much activity the day(s) before? mine come out of the blue which is frustrating to no end. would like to know whether i have kindred spirits out there. thank you.

"Hi all
I've been taking Prednisolone for Polymyalgia for three years now but got down to 1-2mg. I stopped completely about one week ago, but when I stand up after sitting for a while I'm stiff, it takes me a few steps to get upright and moving properly. It doesn't feel like Polymyalgia, just circulation, stiffness. I'm 54 and pretty fit, so I don't believe it's just old age related.
Do you know if this stiffness will go away? Any idea what's causing it? Is it still Polymyalgia?
Thanks in advance

"Hi,
I'm not very good at finding info from previous posts so forgive me for asking, yet again, an often asked question.
Are the symptoms of withdrawal the same as the symptoms of PMR itself? If so, how does one know the difference? If they are, what is the science behind it.
Are there any informative papers about withdrawal?
I am assuming that because my symptoms are the same as my original, only less severe, that it is PMR I am feeling and that my steroid level is just not quite high enough?
As you can tell, I'm just a little confused!!! - nothing new there
Thank you

"I started pred for pmr in Sept. 2016. I've been at 6 mg pred for the past month, having inceased from 5 due to increasing soreness and stiffness in my oelvic girdle, thighs, etc. its been a rough summer with my allergies and recovery from last winters endless bronchitis. per my previous post, i have developed mind numbing fatigue--always present, sometimes its the deathly fatigue where i cant function at all. seems odd because i thought that going up on the prednisone would preclude fatigue or at least mitigate it, but i was wrong. i also thought that the fatigue started mostly around 5 and lower, that was wrong too.
here is my question: having been at 6 mg pred for a month, should i try to reduce to 5 1/2 mg. or stay st 6? ive read both sides--some have said they were would go ahead and reduce because the fatigue would be present anyway, others have said they didnt reduce while experiencing it. what do you all think? thank you.

"Good day all,
I hope those you are having a good day, where ever you are.
Intro for those don't know my story: diagnosed with GCA and PMR in June, and have longstanding
secondary Progressive MS. Am on High Dose Pred for GCA and then the PMR will be addressed. I am not pleased with my Rheum's taper schedule for GCA but that's a topic for the future if this becomes a problem.
My story today is my hands. I want them back. They are barely functioning, clumsy, greatly altered sensation, and it feels as if I have no ""fingerprint"" lines on the tips, when I feel the tip of one finger with another. Like, no texture there to work with. They look like skeleton hands.
They are the only thing I have, as I live a disabled home-based life due to MS. I can walk and do well here and in our yard. I use a walker when away from the house. I do not drive. I've kept sane with my quilting, sewing, knitting and keeping house. Now I've got nothing. I am slowly knitting a baby blanket, using a thicker yarn than I usually employ, so at least have that. I cannot pin fabric together to sew a seam. I'm trying to make a bag and it's torture. I won't even look at making a quilt block, that's completely out of the question.
My neurologist does not believe it is MS, due to the onset timing being coincidental to the PMR and
GCA arrival and also that it is bilateral and confined to just my hands and wrists. (I do not have a relapsing form of MS, and he said even if I did, this presentation is simply too atypical of MS).
I'm guessing there's no answer to this, and perhaps I'm just here to complain!
Thanks for listening.

"Hi all,
I hope you are all comfy this evening, where ever you are.
I'm here to talk Fosamax. I was diagnosed with GCA and PMR in early June. Am presently on high dose steroids to first knock down GCA. At the initial meeting with the Rheumatologist he prescribed Fosamax, a drug I swore I would never, ever take. I capitulated and started, have done 3 doses now.
My bones are GOOD. My routine bone density test of May showed that at 63 yo I am ""denser"" than 75% of the women in my age group. (I've been quite proud of this.) However, since I have Secondary Progressive MS, the Rheum sees me as a high risk fall candidate. Actually, the opposite is the truth, as I have braces on my lower legs that keep me very steady and when outside of the house, I use a walker. I am very careful and safe. And 98% of my life is spent in my home and in my yard, where I have a large wheeled walker to use on the lawn. We have more safety rails inside and out than Home Depot.
I have bony growths along my lower gum line and on the roof of my mouth, called ""Tori."" Hereditary condition. After my third dose of Fosamax, the Tori underwent a crazy accelerated rate of growth and were very sore. I went to show the dentist and he could tell that the Tori were angry. Existing areas had expanded out and new areas had appeared. Two new growths are on an area where there previously were no Tori at all. The dentist did search the web for info for Fosamax and Tori growth but came up with nothing. Doesn't matter, my mouth is my story.
Bottom Line: I AM DONE WITH FOSAMAX! With the length of treatment time and amount of Prednisone needed for GCA and THEN PMR, I'll have to have my mouth reconstructed if I continue to use this med, which is obviously affecting the Tori in my mouth.
My question: What should I take instead to protect my bones as best as I can? Foods, Calcium, Vitamin D, how much of what?
I figure that the answer to this lies among someone here. I'm sure the Rheumatologist is not going to be please, but oh, well, it's my mouth. My husband took one look tonight and said ""OK you are done with that stuff."" It's nice to have backup!
I will appreciate any advice you can bring to me.
Peace,
Angela

"I do hope someone can help! I have had severe pain in one shoulder, both hips and sciatic pain in arm and down outside of both legs for the past week.
I know that I have a compressed nerve my lower back, which has been causing severe lower back and sciatic pain on the side where the compressed nerve is located for several weeks, and I was awaiting surgical review/treatment. However, onset of pain in the multiple locations as well as in my back have led to me seeing a GP a today. He took blood tests. suggested I had Polymyalgia Rheumatica and that, h if it was P. M. R. I'd be given Prednisone to treat the problem.
However, having looked up Prednisone and read about contra indications and side effects I can see that, because I have Major Depression and GAD, for which I have been getting treatment for the past decade or more, steroid treatment is likely to be dangerous given my current Mental Health issues and and therefore would be impossible to tolerate.
Most information about this condition I have read fails to give any alternatives to Prednisone treatment. Is there any other treament for people who, like myself, are unable to tolerate steroids or do we just have to put up with the severe pain indefinitely?

"Can anyone tell me if PMR is arthritis or rheumatism? Or is it ""just"" inflammation? The reason that I ask is that I have never even had a suggestion of arthritis or rheumatism. It has not been in the family either. I got PMR overnight last year in November. I was 62 years old. Literally, one day I was doing Crossfit and doing all the things that I love and then ... BAM... the next day I was practically an invalid. I was even able to do various gymnastics and do head and handstands!
Even though I have PMR, believe me, I am very grateful for prednisone which has returned much of my ""former"" life back to me but at a slower pace. I am still puzzled how I got this diagnosis (which is correct) without any prior history of either arthritis or rheumatism.

"Hello all and thank you to those who are supporting me as I arrived here shortly after being diagnosed with GCA and PMR, and already have Secondary Progressive MS,
There's a vexing question in my mind this is kind of irrelevant but curious. My diagnoses are solid, with bloodwork and temporal biopsy and symptom analysis, so there's no question I am in the right place.
The vexing question is that as I read other people's stories I see talk of furious pain with PMR, and I do feel for those in that much pain, it's a difficult thing to live with.
Tracing back time here, I believe GCA and PMR descended upon me in early April 2019, when a triple layer of fatigue (add that to the MS fatigue!) and odd stiffness in the morning began, along with screaming headaches. My shoulders, upper arms, hips were so stiff in the morning I could not roll over in the bed and had to invent a new way to move around. It took me a long time to get up, rolling, and ready for the day. Showering and dressing took forever. If I picked something up, I'd drop it. I've been having trouble with the function of my hands for a while, and that worsened greatly.
However, even with these difficulties, my pain level was not anything like what I've read of others experiencing. MS is a painful disease, and I've pretty much become used to living in pain for many years. So, when these symptoms started, I initially figured ""dang MS,"" And now we know that's not what it was. I wonder if my pain felt different than others because I am so used to living with and pushing through MS pain? Not that I want to sign up for pain, am just wondering.
As my GCA treatment started, I noticed things that were painful now are not, although the areas of my body that have MS pain still do. That's normal. My hands are useless and only time will tell what is causing that.
A second question: Can one have PMR for a long time and just live with it until something hits the fan? In my case, in 2015 December I had urgent surgery for a 98% occlusion of a carotid artery. And, I swear I was never the same after that. I'd go to my MS neuro appointments and always say ""everything hurts."" The neuro would tap here and there, squeeze a shoulder (ouch) and say ya MS is painful and perhaps you have Fibromyalgia too. So, I continued to push through the pain I was living with. It did not clearly become ""something else"" until this April's fatigue and stiffness storm. I've been a beast since that 2015 surgery and since I have started prednisone, I get up in a totally better frame of mind now. I've been just plain rotten since 2015 and now I am not. The high dose prednisone is no great treat, but it is working on the GCA so I'll take the side effects any day over what I had before starting on treatment.
Thanks to anyone who may have insight on my curious questions.

"New member here, seeking support.
I am a 63 yo caucasian woman, I live in MA, USA. I've had many auto immune disorders over my life time, starting with severe excema as a young child. In my teens I had a 6 month case of mono that the pediatrician labelled as the ""worse case he's ever treated."" In my 20's I started with Multiple Sclerosis (studies connect this to the same virus that causes Mono.) MS has had a profound affect on my life in the past 10 years. I stopped driving and activities had to fall off the map bit by bit. I do still walk, although wear braces on my lower legs and use a walker. I have cognitive loss.
I am lucky that I live in a one story home with my husband, 3 dogs and 2 cats and a lovely garden yard. I have girlfriends that take me out to lunch once each week and make sure I have rides and ""dates"" for haircuts and pedicures,
After what seems like an eternity of me reporting to my PCP and neurologist ""everything hurts"" everything got real bad about 12 weeks ago. MS fatigue is bad enough, and a thicker layer fell upon me along with ""everything hurts"" becoming more focused. And, as usually has happened, I became my best advocate which led to me being diagnosed with PMR and GCA, (Sed Rate and CRP 4 x normal high). I have finished the 60 mg week for GCA and am now starting the 40 MG weeks, and on it will go. GCA was diagnosed via temporal artery biopsy.
I feel like death from the steroids and the damage left behind by PMR. I'm going to be on treatment forever, it seems. I've lost the use of my hands, as PMR affected my wrists and totally closed the carpal tunnel. I had carpal tunnel surgery in 1996 and it will need to be done again, more extensively. I suppose that won't happen until I am in remission from PMR.? I do not know what I will do if the function of my hands cannot be restored.
All I had going for me is my quilting and knitting, and now that is gone. I am part of nothing now. My hands are useless. If I pick something up, I drop it. I used to type 120 wpm and I am typing now with my pointer fingers only. I have adapted my knitting to enable me to knit for limited intervals, doing none of the master level work I used to do. I cannot work at quilting at all.
I have no idea how to live like this. With the 3 disorders eating me up, it is very difficult for me to consider going out and about. It's all so very difficult. I am so very tired and do not sleep well, in spite of a major cocktail of MS symptoms meds at night time.
I really need some support, and I hope that I have come to the right place for that and advice.
Thank you and I understand what you are all going through too, and hopefully as I walk this road, I will find ways to be involved here and help others as they arrive.
Peace.

"Ive been on my initial dose of 20mg prednisone for a few weeks and feel great. Pain is gone and have begun daily walks. My next visit to GP is in 3 weeks and I expect to be told to reduce to 15mg or 10mg at that time.
I've been reading a lot about the slow prednisone taper method (DSNS ?) and it seems the best way to reduce dosage while still getting enough prednisone to keep PMR in check. 20mg to 15mg reduction will be greater than 10% reduction and although 15mg is still a large dose there is a possibility of a flare.
How will I know if I am having a flare Do flares appear suddenly and knock you back into the excruciating pain and inability to move or are they more gradual? will it be obvious to me when I have a flare?

"Hi all,
71 year-old male, 5th year into PMR, and have had a relatively easy time with it so far. Started at 50 MG, got down to 0.5, and had to up it to 1.5MG about a month ago. I've had a few minor flares, but nothing major until this AM.
Some background: I damaged my rotator cuff about 6 weeks ago while using a chainsaw to clear up some brush. Since then, everything has gone to pot. Shoulder pain and fatigue -- a lot of fatigue.
But it's been 6 weeks since the injury, and the pain of the rotator cuff injury is a bit better -- so yesterday I went outside and returned for a small bit of yard work. I used a chainsaw, loaded some pine branches onto my pickup truck, and hauled them away. Remember, I had been doing this for weeks prior to hurting my rotator cuff with no PMR side-effects other than the rotator cuff injury.
But last night was awful. I moaned turning in bed. This AM I felt like I did 5 years ago when the PMR rose its ugly head. Everything hurt. All my muscles, my joints -- everything. And the fatigue is debilitating.
After a lot of thinking, I decided to take 5 MG of prednisone. So far, only minimal improvement (after 4 hours).
So what do you think? Should I keep it a 5 MG, go higher, or go back to the doctor (who is trying to get me off the prednisone?)
Thanks all you marvelous people!

here's my story
I was a very active and fit senior going to gym 5 days a week and able to do any physical activity. I spent all day May 12th preparing the house exterior for painting. I was up and down a ladder with scrub brush, pressure washer and bucket of cleaning solution working hard all day as rain was coming the next day. I was tired but not sore. Two days later I woke up in the middle of the night in agony, unable to move. pain was in both knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. since then I haven't been able to get out of bed unaided, unable to dress myself, forget trying to sit on toilet. after many visits to doctors they settled on the polymyalgia rheumatica diagnosis. started on 20 mg prednisone with follow up doctor in one week.
I've read a bit on the web and not thrilled to join the PMR club.
anyone out there have success stories of completely regaining their previous levels of activity?
anyone have suggestions for the speediest recovery possible?
any helpful sources of information?

"i started on pred for pmr in sept. 2016. currently i am on 6 mg. pred--my third summer to go back up to 6. summers are hard for me with all my allergies, etc. anyway, this summer in particular i am overwhelmingly fatigued, almost to the point of being housebound. sometimes in the midafternoons i pop up a little but not a lot. the type of fatigue i have is helped by rest--10-15 minutes or maybe more and i can get up a little and do something that needs to be done. and then im exhausted all over again.
here is my question: IF my fatigue is due to adrenal fatigue from my adrenals having to kickstart again after having been on pred for so long, how long does the fatigue usually last? until the adrenals kick in--if and when they ever do--or until i get to a certain level of pred? or when the pmr burns itself out? What im asking is, from reading the boards i really cant tell, is everyone different? Or is there some general thought about the duration of fatigue? Is it generally thought to be a symptom of pmr or the impact pred has on our adrenals, that really is my question. thank you.

yesterday nurse called to say the bump was basal cell c; i have to have a procedure where they scrape some off, then do lab test for couple hours, then scrape more, etc. can take all day. and more lidocaine, a lot more, of course. she said my eye will likely droop again, that it can last up to several months in some people, etc.
i was obviously shaken by the first procedure that resulted in my eye and drooping forehead, and will probably be a lot more shaken by the next procedure that isnt scheduled yet. so heres one question: do i increase the pred just before the procedure? Im currently on 6 mg. if so, by how much and how long? my gp has said in the past that pred makes things bleed, so dont increase if you are going to bleed---which the procedure will cause, at least a little. the doc said the skin is very thin where my bump is . but im thinking of my reaction this past week and how bad i felt the next day.
next question: i didnt think i was that traumatized by the first biopsy--i was shaken by the whole drooping eye thing but didnt expect to be flattened and in pain a day later. so am i nuts, do you think? thank you.

"My GP has got a date for my Dexa scan 17th July, so i went and got a copy of the letter my rhymi sent her.
RA Mechanical neck and back
mildly raised CK but autoantibody screen and myositis blot negative
Plan is to start on 70mg AA
i am still symptomatic with a lot of pain in neck and hands he thinks this is due to osteoarthriti arthritis.
c changes and not due to active inflammatory arthritis.
Temporal artery was not thickened and was pulsatile.
she gets jaw pain, but is about 5 mins after eating so it is not jaw claudication.
my crp is not elevated, she is asking about the bubble wrap noise i expect this is due to osteoarthritic changes.
i think her current symptoms are predominately dur to osteoaarthritis than an active inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis, nevertheless there seems to be some response to steroids, she has had a IMA STEROID injection to cover here for a few months, she is to reduce here steroids 1mg a month,as she is still on pred.
she is to start AA 70mg per week
we will see her in six months'
I still think i need to speak about my last scan it showed osteopenia in 2017 he said, i cannot find my last scan results.
He did not seen concerened about by MRI scan
I have never felt so ill as i have in this last week, waking up barking in the night with a cough, pains in legs '

"I have just learned the existence of Silent Acid Reflux (laryngo-pharyngeal reflux (LPR)). Silent Acid Reflux is a possible side effect of taking prednisone. I have been experiencing it for about three months. I had an endoscopy and been to see a throat and nose doctor. My chest tests do not show signs of having pneumonia or do I have heart problems. I only took prednisone for a week. I was given it at the ER when experiencing an asthma attack. The ER doctor took an X-ray but it did not prove I had pneumonia but he wanted to play it save. It brought on extreme anxiety and now slowly I have been able to swallow again. I still have a lump in my throat. Yet I am down to taking natural things like apple cider vinegar before eating and baking soda when it gets bad with water. Herb teas and eating smaller portions of food manage it too. I have lost twenty pounds; I am unhappy with how my doctors at Kaiser Permanente ignore the side effects and tend to try and give me more drugs even though they tell me I have nothing wrong with me. One doctor told me I need to deal with my anxiety. I am a 61 year old woman and have had many tests done over this. I am wondering if this will go away with time? I have learned a great deal about this... I feel like I am missing something. I meditate and am trying alternative healing too. I feel like the drug raped me and my doctors don't seem to take it seriously.

Have stiffness and pain mainly in the shoulders, neck, upper arms, pelvic region, thighs, and knees, especially between 9 am and 3 pm. The symptoms ease in the evening and overnight, but I am experiencing hot prickly skin in the torso and head starting around 10 pm, which I think is a histamine reaction related to PMR. The problem is that it is causing insomnia. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms and can they suggest a solution?

"just a couple days ago i posted how sick i felt following a meltdown at an outdoor party coupled with severe summer allergies. following the advice of this forum on monday i increased my daily pred dose from 5 to 7 for a couple days. but: instead of taking 7, i screwed up and think i took 2 1/2--mistaking my pill bottles. yesterday i was deathly ill--couldnt get up, really. i took 10.
today im teensy better--took 10 again--my thinking is to take 10 again tomorrow and then 9,8,7, 6 and stay at 6 for awhile.
but im still terribly weak, just cant stand for more than a few minutes.
tomorrow im getting blood work done--dont know what it will show. what do you think? Am i on the right track? will i recover eventually? Did going from 5 to 2 1/2 for one day really set me back that far? should i stay at 10 longer than 3 days? i never recovered from the weekend when i took the 2 1/2 plus seasonal allergies are at highest levels. thank you.

"another question, please bear with me. how often do you find it necessary to pop up your pred dose for a few days? once a year? every few months? more often? just curious, as ive struggled ever since my winter bout with bronchtiis that i posted a lot about. im currently at 5, started there in january. but it seems like as time goes on, im getting more intolerant of the least bit of increased activity. also i have severe allergies--right now trees and grass pollen are at the highest they can go. my stiffness and soreness is prevalent in the mornings, lessening by mid afternoon--it takes a long time evidently for me to absorb pred--uncoated. and im not one of the ""lucky ones""--ive never ever been pain free with pmr.
any thoughts? im hoping to see what other people do--yes, i know about ""you need what you need"", im trying to find out how often others find it necessary to increase for a few days without putting themselves in a yo-yo situation. by the way, for reference, i just imcreased for a few days after easter, the baking and all day gathering did me in. i also increased in february due to the bronchtisis. thank you.

"Just coming up on 3 years of dealing with PMR and have a question regarding fatigue. I probably read about it before but can't find it.
I'm at 6.5 mg of Pred, just dropping to 6. The last 6 months have gone reasonably well but my work load at age 64 is minimal in the winter, so that makes it easier to keep things in balance. Now that spring is here the work load is increasing but I've made a point to not dive in to things. I picked up a cold 3 weeks ago and fatigue has gradually increased until it's relentless now and it's a struggle to do almost anything. The cold is gone but the fatigue remains. My question - is there any value to increasing the prednisone dose to knock down the fatigue? It seems to me that the answer is no but am not sure. I'd gladly move the dose up if I felt it'd yield results.
I'm not worried about prednisone and appreciate all it accomplishes. Sure, I'd like to someday be off it but the first goal is to continue functioning well and feeling as close to the new ""normal"" as I can.

"Hi all,
Ive been on PMR train for 4 years with 2 flares. 2 weeks ago I was down to 5 mg in my latest taper -- Ive never taken more than 15 mg and then only at the initial inset and my first flare. Im experiencing a lot of stress due to a crucial set of exams - next week I take the final three. Ive developed severe inflammation and stiffness in both knees in the past month, with increasing exhaustion. The closer I get to my next set of exams the worse the anxiety gets. Its like the knees, the anxiety, and the exhaustion are increasing at the same pace. So this morning I went from 10 to 15 mg to see if it would make a dent. It didnt. Since the anxiety and the PMR effects in the knees are evidently coorelated, I'm wondering if anyone has ever tried addressing a stress-related flare from the 'other' side -- that is through short term use of ativan or some other anxiolytic. Id be grateful to hear of any your experiences. Thx!

"Hi all,
After reading here about the product Dermatuff for skin that bleeds and bruises easily, I ordered a pair of socks and sleeves. First, I have to say, my skin on my arms and legs is like butter. Anything that touches it, even the slightest, will result in blood or a bruise. I was skeptical. I have been wearing them now, for a couple of weeks, without a clear opinion one way or the other. Yesterday, however, they were put to the test. I was in the garden revamping my raised beds, and was using a heavy crow bar. Yes, that's right; it hit my foreleg, and it hurt. I quickly ran to the house for the plasters, but there was no blood. Today, no sign of a bruise. They work. However, ticks can still get under them and have a feeding. But they are not meant for tick protection. They are quite dear, but worth it.

"Hi, Awaiting a blood test, but everything matches and I'm beginning to worry. I'm 59 and a keen, fit runner - i was training for a marathon before the stiffness started in my thighs, hips & shoulders 2 months ago . I have only recently got over a period of extreme health anxiety by running. It literally saved my life, and i have had some amazing achievements for a guy my age winning my 1st ever medals & prizes for my age group. I had very high blood pressure & was overweight & unfit, as well as the anxiety before i started running. I now have perfect BMI, don't drink or smoke, and have healthy veggie diet. If i do have PM, it would be a nightmare for me. I can just about run still after a long warm-up, so should i continue - i can cope with the pain? Also I really don't want to take steroids as the side affects would be devastating for me. I've even heard they destroy your muscles and cause suicidal thoughts, as well as putting up your blood pressure. I fought really hard to get it down without having to take drugs so I'm not doing anything to put it back up! (My dad died of strokes & pulmonary when i was very young, and he was only 37) . can i cope without the steroids - I've heard they only treat symptoms and don't cure? I'm really scared and my health anxiety is coming back. Also how long does PM last if i do have it - NHS says around 2 years - is it possible to shorten this by diet, exercise, physio etc? can't wait to get back to normal!!

"I have a very painful back and have had for 15 years. When I was diagnosed with PMR 3 years ago I didn't notice any difference in my back pain. the pain I felt was predominantly in my thighs, neck, shoulders and forearms. as soon as I took the prednisone it all got better. both my sed rate and C-reactive protein were pretty high at that time. so I have taper down to 1 mg when I got a case of gout. The doctor put me on 30 mg prednisone and the pain in my lower back and neck improved significantly. once I had tapered back down to 1 mg the pain returned. so I did it again starting at 30 mg and tapering down fast like a normal person would. once again the pain is back. my rheumatologist just email me my blood test results and my sed rate was normal and my C-reactive protein was only a little high at .6. my question is if prednisone helped my pain that much does that not mean that it's PMR pain? are there other kinds of pain such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis that can be relieved that much with steroids? I will be seeing my rheumatologist next week but I was hoping to get other people's opinions.

"i seem to recall on another forum a discussion about split dose at 5 mg pred--some were saying their rheumies told them when they got to 5 mg, they should not do split dose because 5 mg is where the dose starts to kick in the adrenals--so if you do a split dose at that level, you are thwarting the natural adrenals activity. poorly worded on my part but im not adept at forum searches.
i am at 5 mg, struggling with soreness in the mornings--it takes forever for the pred to kick in for me. so i thought maybe i would try a 3-2 split but then i recalled that discussion about not splitting the dose at 5 mg, what do you all think? thank you.

"I contracted Polymyalgia about four years ago. A high dose (30mg) of Prednisone made symptoms tolerable but I was pretty sore and stiff in the mornings. With a few ups and downs I have slowly recovered and gradually tapered down to zero about a month ago. However, I have recently been suffering from stiff legs and pain in the mornings. Initially I thought this was normal stiffness (although I never suffered from this before PMR) from exercise as I had been doing quite a lot of cycling. But I'm now stiff with sore muscles in my legs with no real exercise the day before and I'm wondering if it is PMR returning. It is nothing like a full blown attack but a bit worrying nevertheless. I am not sure whether to take some prednisone, and if so what dose. I was thinking of 5mg to see what happens. Things are further complicated because I am going for a knee replacement operation tomorrow. A doctor friend of mine who has followed my case since the beginning told me that the anesthetist will probably give me a dose of prednisone anyway, given my history of PMR. I don't know if I need to remind him of this or how important it might be to have or not have prednisone before a major operation.

Well, I jut had a bout of positional vertigo, which lasted about 12 hours. I started having these about the same time I had my first go around with PMR, about 15 years ago.

Did OK with the first 1/2 of the method. However, today was the 2nd day of the send 1/2 of the plan where I went from 1 day old (13.5) to 1 day new (13) and tomorrow I am supposed to take 1 day new ( 13) again.
Problem is I can feel the pain and stiffness returning to the point that it is affecting my day. I will most likely go ahead with the plan to take 13 tomorrow and see how I react.
My dilemma is if it gets worse after tomorrow's dose where should I go back to ?
If I was OK at 1 day new (13) and 2 or 3 days old (13.5) is that where I go back to and pick up again from there ?

"About 6 months ago, I began having pain in both shoulders. I had been playing a lot of golf and in line with that was doing a lot of upper body exercises. I overdid it and was first diagnosed with two partially torn rotator cuffs. But the pain and stiffness got worse and spread to my arms, then wrists and upper part of my legs. All the normal functions of life changed: putting a shirt or socks on; getting into the car and putting on a seat belt became a task. At one point, I was having to lift a coffee cup with 2 hands.
After the rheumatologist did the confirming tests, I was diagnosed with PMR. Starting out with 20 mg of prednisone, the pain disappeared. Early on, I decided I was cured and decided to just use Ibuprophen. Wrong decision. It came roaring back. I went back on 15 mg, and for the last 2 months I'm on 10 (5 in the morning and 5 in the evening).
I hope to be down to 5 mg within the next month.
I'm almost 73 years old. In addition to the prednisone, I'm also on BP medication and a statin . I also take CoQ10 to offset downside of the statin, Vitamin D, Tumeric, Calcium Magnese, and Fish Oil.
I'm back to playing golf with no pain and walking 3 miles or so is no longer a problem.
I believe that part of my recovery is due to my daily routine. I was in Physical Therapy for several weeks and I have now created a way to modify several of those exercises and do them in a hot tub we have.I get up every morning between 4:30 and 5:00 am and do these exercises: 2 sets of what looks like a breast stroke - head above water ; then a reverse backstroke (120 of each; then arms bent at a 90 degree angle and doing 2 sets of 35 reaching back as far as possible; then with 3 pound weight - reaching arms forward as far as possible as if I'm peddling a bike but with my arms 120 forward; 60 reversed.
I'll report back in a couple more months about any progress or lack thereof.
A friend with PMR referred me to this discussion group which is outstanding. Glad to contribute.

"Good morning,
yesterday after 2 months on 5 mg pred, I reduced to 4.5 mg. This morning I woke up with stiffness and discomfort in my legs and arms. I am correct in assuming that this is possibly pred withdrawal symptoms and not a flare? I am planning to follow the very slow dose reduction from Eileen's post that was kindly shared with me (https://patient.info/forums/discuss/reducing-pred-dead-slow-and-nearly-stop-method-531439?page=7#3498075 ), thank you! Once I have established the 4.5 mg dose (by 21 June), when next would you advise dropping to 4 mg, after 2 months?
I find this site very helpful and would like to thank all of the contributors. I naively thought that this would be an easy patient journey, but it isn't and can at time be very frustrating.
Best regards

"I was Diagnosed with PMR last March 2019. I woke up in excruciating pain called my doctor. I went in to his office that day he did a blood test, called me that night and told me I had PMR and put me on 60 mg of prednisone. I have been trying to reduce with only a slight flareup last summer then a very severe one at Christmas time.
Here is my question. Sometimes I’m not convinced that what I have is PMR. at the same time I’ve been diagnosed with the generating discs in my back and I question that it might have been my back at Christmas time. I read everyone’s story here and everyone is in such pain all the time I’m not in pain. I did go to a rheumatologist as you people advise me and he says I do have it. But still everyone is in such pain and I’m not. At this time I am reduced to 7 1/2 mg and a bit scared to go down to seven because that’s where I had that “” flare up"" . Is it possible that because I was diagnosed the very first day I had pain, it was very severe , that I don’t have a problem like everyone else? Because I was diagnosed so quickly?
You are all so kind and understanding, thank you very much in advance for your input.

"Perhaps one day researchers into PMR (is anyone out there interested in our condition other than those in its grip - and they would be too fatigued to do any research?) will find PMR pain attracts more pain. I can't believe that I have a new pain to add to my neck and my arm and my back.
The pain in my left hand started slowly yesterday and I thought: winter is on its way; this must be what arthritis is like. But by last night I was in agony and couldn't move my hand. So consulted Dr Google and together we diagnosed Carpal Tunnel (which I had had operated on my right hand several pre-PMR years ago).
Have any PMR sufferers found a link between that syndrome and ours? And would increasing my Prednisolone help? I have been struggling since June to reduce from 15mgs (I had gone all the way down to 6mgs - my personal best in five years - before being Flared Out) and can't get below 10+lingering pain.
When it is such a battle to reduce the Pred, I am reluctant to up it for the suspected Carpal Tunnel without your advice on whether it may help. You are all I can turn to. I have a horror of being labelled a hypochondriac by that lucky non-PMR world.

"Hi all.A brief summary of my situation: Diagnosed with PMR about a year ago. Been reducing pred slowly, was at 5 mg for about a month, then last Friday, thought I'd try 4.5 mg., but only once, then back to 5. Two days ago, I started getting a sore throat, and a headache, that imitrex wasn't helping much, (I usually take a small amount daily for prevention of migraines). Then I started to get a neck ache. The headache and the neck ache were only on my right side. Last night it seemed worse, so I took 6 mg of pred, thinking, oh no, I hope this isn't GCA coming on, and that I would ask my friends on the forum what they thought. This morning it is still here, all of it, headache, neck ache, sore throat.
I'll appreciate any feed back. Thank you so much.

"Hi Dear Forum friends
I have been on this dreadful PMR journey for nearly 6 years now, and I thought I'd recognize any PMR flare ups early by now, still it caught me by surprise and in a vengeance !! I am in a great deal of pain and discomfort, and I am losing my wit how to deal with this ! I have been doing the DSAS method steadily and managed to get myself down to 7 mgs. I started on 30mgs, and with many flares over the years. I have been quite stable and pain free until 3 /4 weeks ago, when I had a relapse of my sciatica problem, which made me very confused with the type of pain i had with PMR. Anyway, as time went by, it became more like PMR flare, as I started to have pain across my pelvis , and then it moved up to my shoulders and upper left arm. The pain is intense, gripping , throbbing and constant. My shoulder felt heavy and it is painful the whole time. I went from 7mgs to 10mgs for 8 days without relief, now I am taking 15 mgs for the the last 4 days, and the pain is only mildly better.Should I persevere on 15mgs for another 1 to 2 weeks or more until the pain is gone before I go back to my 7 mgs, or shall i reduce it from 15ms more slowly. I am also taking co-codymol , and Naproxen, (even though i know they do not do much for PMR! but when the pain is bad, I'd just try anything!)
I really appreciate some advice from all of you, and get my life back on track again. Thank you All.

"Hi, I don't know if you remember my story, but I'm the one who can't get reduced on prednisone without a great deal of pain coming back.

"A few weeks ago I returned (to the US) from a fairly long trip out of the country. It seems that I brought back with me an intestinal disorder common to travelers who are unused to more exotic food preparation. (I think I put that as clearly as possible without getting too graphic.)
Weeks later I still have it, in fact it appears to be getting worse despite all the medications, prescriptions, tests, and dietary changes called for by the doctors. (Yes doctors, plural.)
But, I think I just figured out what's wrong with me...PREDNISONE!
Pred is an immunosupressent. My immune system is incapable of fighting this bug.
Now for my question to the prednisone brain trust we have in this forum... Can I stop taking pred ""cold turkey"" for several days, or whatever time it takes to shake this condition? I'm even prepared to suffer the slings and arrows of PMR for the duration if that is what it takes.

"I made what I now believe to be a mistake in tapering too slowly at the beginning of Pred treatment. With the benefit of hindsight, I misread the enthusiastic endorsements of the DSNS method, and sought to apply a version of it from the starting dose, which in my case was 20mg. I presume the correct advice is that the DSNS method really comes into its own when dose reduction has reached about 10mg and below? If so, may I suggest that this point be given more prominence?
Does it matter? Although many of us will be on the Pred for years, some will get off earlier. The adrenals reportedly shutdown progressively over the first year or so. The earlier we can challenge, preempt or reverse this the better. DSNS is the way to go, but I presume it is best at doses below 10 mg. In my case, I think that I tapered too slowly for nearly a year during which time I offered no ""challenge"" to detect for disease remission and/or stimulate the adrenals.

I am in a flare right now and am back on prednisone 40 mg/day. The high dose is necessary to treat the GCA flair, more so than the PMR flare. The specialist is talking about Actemra IV.

"I may have posted this question last summer, but I can't find any record of it. I was diagnosed with PMR in Sept. 2014, I'm in the US, and seeing the same Rheumatologist I first met 25 yrs. earlier when he treated our then HS age daughter for Lupus (thankfully in remission). After 4 or 5 months on Prednisone, I switched to Medrol, partly because of our daughter's experience. I've been using the Dead Slow program and have transitioned to 2.5 mg. Last summer, I think based on the fact that my hands were swollen and stiff, he brought up sero-negative RA as a possibility. The hands have cleared up. I'd be doing great except that I now need a new right hip. Hip aside, I'm still struggling to understand the differences between the 2 diagnoses. I think I get that the hand involvement is what is more suggestive of RA. And I guess if it does go away, it was more likely PMR after all. What else should I try to understand about the differences?

"Hello all,
I just found this wonderful resource and suspect that I may find more helpful information here than I've been receiving from my GP to date. I'm in Canada where our public health system deals very efficiently with major trauma and life-threatening illness, a condition like PMR, not so much.
Classic PMR symptoms came on suddenly 4 weeks ago - bilateral, proximal pain and stiffness early am, diminishing during the day, CRP the only out of range blood test marker.
I've only been told it appears to be PMR but no definite diagnosis.
For some inexplicable reason I haven't been able to get an appointment with a rheumatologist so far.
Still hopeful.
I was prescribed 20 mg prednisone 21 days ago. I take it with breakfast but suffer pain and discomfort, going from 8-9/10 pain to about 2/10 by around 4-5 hours later.
Today was almost unbearable. I stayed up very late last night, feeling pretty good, but then couldn't sleep as the pain on lying down was too severe. I drifted on and off sleep for about 3 hours, sitting up.
Trying to get up and moving was near impossible because of severe pain and stiffness. Even walking at a slow painful shuffle was almost impossible as was getting dressed (forget trying to pull on socks).
I don't expect diagnostic advice here but I do have a question about dosing from the experience of others.
I'm fearful of a repeat of this day tomorrow, so I'm considering taking prednisone this evening at bed time.
I have read that there is some wisdom to not taking one dose only in the am, the time when flares are raging.
https://www.rheumatologynetwork.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/nighttime-prednisone-could-address-morning-stiffness-ra
I did try and split my dose once before with no improvement - 10 mg am, 10 mg evening.
So I'm thinking of taking 20 mg + 10 mg, not sure which dose when, but I keep reading that ""playing"" with dosing should only be done under the care of a rheumy. However, if I have no appointment date in sight, I would take a chance to deal with the debilitating pain.
Can anyone offer any anecdotal experience?
Thanks!

"Hi,
I’ve been monitoring this wonderfully informative forum since i developed PMR just over a year ago. My primary physician started me on 40 mg of Pred which I was able to reduce down to 20 mg over six weeks when I had my first appointment with a Rheumy. I’m now down to 8 1/2 mg. I’m 76, male and live in the United States.
I’m never totally pain free, especially in the morning. About six months ago, however, I did wake up completely pain free and that lasted for almost two days. I thought at the time that I was rid of the PMR, but after the pain returned it was clear that I had mistakenly taken a couple of 10 mg pills thinking they were 5 mg.
I do have some basic PMR Questions.
If one didn’t take any Pred, would PMR eventually go away? I would assume so.
I’ve assumed that the “strength” (if that’s the right word) of the PMR disease decreases over time, since the amount of Pred required to be pain free (or relatively pain free) decreases as well over time. So, hypothetically, if one stayed at a specific Pred dose, would the strength of the PMR disease continue to decrease? and is that why one is able to decrease Pred? Again I would assume yes.
I guess the question is: what exactly makes PMR eventually go away? Is it just a question of time? Or does the Pred dosage have anything to do with it? Also, does too much exercise cause the PMR to strengthen, ie. flare up? If so, why?
A related question is: when PMR flares up (because of reducing Pred too quickly), is the PMR disease actually strengthening? Or does it just seem to be doing so?
Thank you,
Hardy

"Good evening my friends,
I went to the reumey yesterday for a check up, that I was suppose to have last November, but didn't mind waiting on, because of all the good information I've gotten here. In fact, I was rehearsing what I would say to him, and trying not to let on I knew more than he would like me to. He was happy with my taper, now at 5, but he did not like the fact that I stopped taking alendronate acid, he thought I was taking it all along, but I stopped in December, ( I took it for six months). After he realized I won't take it, he pressed on about zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate. It's given intravenously once yearly, that way it bypasses the stomach, which can cause alot of the side effects we talk about here. But, I guess my question is, more along the long term effects of this drug on the bones; does it really build bones that are going to serve us and keep us from fracturing our hips and ending it all there. Or is it all pharm/doc talk, if you know what I mean.
Thank you all for being there.

"I have been making valiant efforts to improve my conditioning. I did three formal classes in TaiChi, walk on my treadmill for 35 min(holding on), and balance and upper body exercises. My hips are still weak and walking any distance is a real effort. I feel like my body is made of balsam wood. No pain though and on 7.75 mg pred. Would love to walk outside but allergic to pollen.
I had my first session today and, fortunately, this therapist has extensive experience with scoliosis/hardwared spines. So I'm hopeful. Will be 77 next month; not ready to give up yet.

"I am a 65 yr old female. I have had PMR for 6 years. I have also bed on prednisone just as long. My first 4 years I never took above 10mg. My last 2 years I've fluctuated between 10-20 mg. My pain has always been in my hips and upper legs. INTENSE pain in piraformis muscle. Also the side of my left hip. After tiring of my RHUMY who seems to do nothing I got an MRI on my hips to rule out other issues. They found nothing abnormal. Dr. suggested PT for the hip but I opted for a chiropractor. 7 sessions and exercises and it was total relief. I felt I was taking prednisone
for just that for two years.
Determined to get off this stuff I've gotten myself down from 20 to 10 mg. Now the hard part begins.
I find that after minimal walking or working in the yard my thighs and upper legs are killing me. Never happened before . If I use a rolling stick it subsides a bit. I've never had this before I've been an active cyclist in the warm months. I also swim and kayak. I'll admit this winter I have not been real active.
This has come on in the last few months. I feel as though I've run 5 miles, as I used to be a runner.
Is it the PMR? Is it the deterioration of my muscles?
Eileen can you help?

"Hello, I'm new. I'm pretty sure I have PMR and have a GP appointment today. I have all the symptoms and my blood results have come back abnormal.
I really do not want steroids! The side effects sound horrendous, but the main issues are: I spent the best part of last year losing weight and eventually lost over 20 pounds. This helped with my chronic mental health problems which I have struggled with for most of my life. I had a relapse over Christmas and new year, but have improved again. I fear that pred and weight gain will throw me into another vicious cycle of depression and weight gain.
I am also terrified of osteoporosis as my friend died from it a couple of years ago.
Would steroid shots avoid any of these problems or could I try to manage with strong NSAIDS? I'm already feeling 'delicate' and vulnerable and I've not even been prescribed anything. Can I refuse daily toxins (pred) in the hope of avoiding the misery that has plagued my life?

"I have been on the PMR journey for 5 years and 9 months now!! I started at 30mgs and gradually came down to 2/3 mgs, and went up and down again like a yoyo over the whole period with flares in between. This latest leg pain got me a bit confused. I have sciatica with bulging discs on L4/5 and S1 as shown on the MRI diagnosed April 2018.That seems to have settled down now since I follow a regime of exercise. But it has left me with 2 numb toes (the last 2 little toes) and numb feeling along side the foot on one leg. I managed this so far with very little analgesia.
Three / 4 days ago, I was doing some moderate gardening, and after that I felt this pain on my leg (same left leg all the time) . At the time I thought it was my sciatica , so i was mindful of my posture and exercise and had to take analgesia to manage the pain. However, this pain become quite constant and gripping, and i could hardly bear weight on it. And it reminded me of the type of pain I had when I have flare ups. The only small relief i have is by lying down or sitting down.
I am on 7mgs of Pred using the DSAS method, and it seems fine so far , until now!This morning, I have decided to go up to 8.5mgs. My question is , is that a reasonable increase dose to curb this ?? flare? And if i manage to bring the pain down a bit, how long should i stay on 8.5mg before returning to 7mgs, and then continue my journey in reducing ?
Thank you ALL for your expert advice, especially Eileen. I always read all the PMR posts, and it is such a good learning source.

"After a king sized flare 18 months ago, i have got down to a 6.5 MG dose of pred , using the DSNS,but modified to one quarter Mg per month. Then things went pearshape. and i was not feeling too good at all, thinking that PMR was returning, but mindful of once under 7Mg daily i am into the zone where the adrenal glands may be kicking in. With a back problem and torn ligaments in both shoulders , this can mask my PMR signals, also our summer has been really hot and humid , so all this sort of put me off course. Any way i went to see my GP to get a referral to see my rheumy. Told her my symptoms and straightaway she said that is not PMR , it is pred withdrawl , up your dose to 8Mg and come back in a week . I mentioned an adrenal test and she said too complicated. ( i dont know)....... She did say because i have been on pred for so many years that the glands may or may not kick in so just stay on 7Mg for a couple of months then slowly drop, but go back up if necessary, She didnt seem to think at my age (81) ,staying on 7Mg for ever was going to be a problem. just have a bone density test occasionally. So there you go, my first pred withdrawl problem, my symptoms have gone and i am back on track again. ............ i hope !!!

"I have been getting random, moderately painful pains on the side of the inside of my left foot. The first time I ever felt this pain was a few years ago, possibly 2-3 years ago. The pain comes randomly, and it is instantly accompanied by a temporary inability to move my toes, and a swollen, red spot where most of the pain is. The pains span about 30 secs-1 min. As soon as the pains stop, I can move my toes again and the swelling/redness goes down immediately. These pains don't come the often
Just some background info, I used to run track during the time the pains started happening and I currently ride horses, both of which involve a lot of footwork. Also, none of this has happened to my right foot, only my left in the same exact spot, with the same exact pains/symptoms.
My Theories:
Sesamoiditis: I heard this is common in people who run or do footwork often, and I also heard that this condition is accompanied with the inability to move the big toe, though the thing is that I don't have the ability to move all of my toes only when the pain is happening
Pinched Nerve
The pain may be triggered by foot position, though I am not sure
Muscle spasm

"I'm tempted to just leave my title there and wait for replies, to see if anyone here might be like-minded in trying to understand the oddities of their perhaps ever-changing PMR symptoms.
Relating this to my own symptoms, from the very first days, the condition mostly spread to an increasing number of joints, not to mention the fatigue, ear-aches, head-aches and later, my palms and the soles of my feet.
With prednisone, most symptoms decreased sharply, but as I was on a fast monthly taper regimen of 1mg per month, so symptoms reappeared within six months and new symptoms I hadn't had then also appeared.
Years go by, and I have long since taken control of my dosage based on my symptoms ""in real time"".
I also noted big seasonal changes in my dosage requirement to the tune of ~100% (worse in Summer, better in Winter, and which persists to this day all of five years later).
But it was the ""wandering"" characteristic of PMR symptoms which caught my attention, symptoms that didn't appear to be related to any localized stress where the symptoms appeared. It seemed to me that at times the PMR ""attack"" would mostly leave one area of my body and move to a different area of my body, instead of the overall symptom levels rising and falling in the different areas together.
Now I have posted here periodically as I got down to 2mg/day in Winter, only then having to again use up to 5mg/day when the summer months came.
To be sure, there has been a long-term trend toward lower dosages, though with the past two years being almost the same (but for the fact that I managed to spare myself the Summer flare-up with more-timely higher dosing.
This Winter has now been quite different though. I'd had a lengthy respiratory infection around the holiday season, then a few weeks lapse and then a second, brief, and very different batch of respiratory symptoms with a brief slight fever added in. Not normal for me, but not so unusual either.
Then just three weeks ago, another prolonged nose/throat/airway infection that really lingered despite causing no really severe symptoms such as a plugged sinus or noticeable fever, though accompanied by a nasty case of pink-eye infection towards the end of it's run.
But now the funny thing is that, after cutting my pred intake sharply in order to boost my immune response to the bugs, I suddenly find myself cured of the infections AND taking no prednisone at all.
It's been only ten days with no pred, but my energy levels reflect no more supression of my adrenals, and my skeletal symptoms are almost nil, very tolerable and no flaring as of yet.
So the question I leave here is whether the immune system perhaps needs some sort of challenging distraction in order for it to focus on the distraction and finally restore pre-PMR order when the infection has been conquered(?).
Needless to say, I am extremely optimistic at this point, and hoping my story might give reason for optimism among you all!

"I am now in my 5th year of Prednisone. Flaring every time I get below 7 mg.
In despair I tried the over- the- counter food supplement CBD oil. I wasn't sure if it helped or not so ordered another 10cc bottle from the UK - but the customs people confiscated it - so I won't try that again! I then went to a pain specialist to apply for a licence for medical M. and was told that I would have to be on analgesics unsuccessfully for a year and then apply again.. but life's too short to throw away another year and fill my body with more stuff. Then a friend referred me to a very senior rheumatologist who had helped her. In addition to doing a million tests to eliminate anything else, she diagnosed sicca syndrome which she thinks actually been caused by the steriods. It seems now that I cannot live without the steroids but I also cannot live with them.
The rheumatologist assured me that I would be off Prednisone within 2 years by following an 'old' protocol. She also said she was confident that the adrenal glands would function again using this very slow protocol. The protocol she suggested is the ""dead slow and nearly stop"" protocol with the addition of a full month between each reduction.
So, it would take 6 full weeks to taper from the old dose to the new dose by 1 mg. and then another 6 weeks at the new dose before beginning the next 1 mg reduction. This basically means that each 1 mg reduction will take 12 weeks.
Will it work? Who knows... maybe it's worth a try!

"I haven't contributed to the forum since before Christmas, but have been reading everything, including the occasional very helpful 'links' from Eileen, so this is to say, first, how very grateful we've been for this help from the forum, especially from Eileen.
Husband George (who is about to be 76) was diagnosed in UK with PMR last October and put on 15 mg Pred.
When he got home to France village doctor wasn't up to it, but eventually she sent him to a rheumy who put him in hospital for 4 days, for many tests. The outcome being, just what we thought, that he has PMR! Or, PPR, as the French call it.
He has gradually reduced to 10mg Pred, with no problems so far. The Rheumy has asked him to reduce down to 5mg by beginning of September... sounds a bit soon...
One of his tests was bone-density and it came back normal. We understand that taking Pred could lead to osteoporosis.
Rheumy has written: "" The patient is having a corticosteroid therapy, and treatment with oral bisphosphonates is essential, with densimetric control during 2 years"". (Translation)
She has prescribed Risedronate 75 mg (Actonel) which we understand is a Bisphosphonate. He is supposed to take it 2 consecutive days each month, standing-up, to protect the oesophogas.!
We've been reading about it - including reviews - and it looks awful. People say they've had terrible experiences with this medicine. I don't want George to take it. He is a big-boned man. His bone-density is normal at present. He's been taking 1000 mg calcium each day in evenings. Isn't that enough - at least for the time being?
Does anyone have experience of this medicine? We'd be grateful for advice..

Was diagnosed with pmr about two years ago and for the first twelve months or so on pred was able to reduce gradually and still feel ok. Trouble is as I get below 10 mg symptoms or what I believe to be symptoms of pmr start to return. I've had pain in my left shoulder and neck for months, admittedly not severe and described by my GP as probably arthritis at my age and increasingly pain in hips, thighs ,buttocks. The pain shifts and varies in severity but there are days now when I struggle to walk and have to waddle like a duck . GP says this is osteoarthritis and gave me a sheet of exercises. Over the counter painkillers dont touch it .I was referred to a consultant rheumatologist about eight months ago to try and speed up the reduction who confirmed the pmr diagnosis then passed my care back to GP . The regime consists of monthly blood test and if inflammatory markers are not raised , and it would seem they are not , I am instructed to reduce pred by 1mg. When i suggested very politely to my GP that 1 mg reduction might be too much especially when trying to get below 10 mg I was told that was the regime .Over the last month I've been reducing from 9 to 8mg using dead slow stop . However I woke up early hours of this morning ,tried to turn over and the pain in my shoulder and upperarm was awful ,hips bad also , like the before pred pain .
I'm due a blood test tomorrow and am very concerned that if the markers are not raised I'll be told to carry on with 1mg reduction. What should I do .Should i up the dose of pred and if so by how much and for how long to see if the pmr is the problem Would i then have to reduce slowly again . I feel going back to the GP is pointless . Id welcome any advice ,Joan.

"Went to the dentist this morning for a routiene check up. The first part of that routiene check up is a routiene blood pressure check. No problem there, my BP sitting in that very same chair on previous check ups is usually around 116/80.
Well, today it was 191/90!
None of my medications have changed...except my prednisone taper.
Here's my theory on what is going on: I think that my adrenal glands are crying out for help.
I came across this comment in a Google search: ."" An overactive adrenal system can cause sudden spikes in blood pressure and hypertension.""
I'm at 6.5mg of pred having tapered down from 7.0 over the period of a month using DSNS. At this dosage, the adrenals are now expected to do something on their own. Given that they have been snoozing for the last two years, they probably don't remember what to do, and they're thrashing about trying to figure out what their responsibility is in this situation.
Crackpot theories, aside, I am concerned about the BP spike, and am, like my adrenals, thrashing about looking for an explanation.
Can anyone in this hallowed forum shed some light on the possible connection between PMR, prednisone, tapering, and blood pressure?

My pain clinic dr was sure that my problem was the nerves of my lower spine were rubbing on the bone and I would feel better if I had an ablation. So I waited until I had one,which was yesterday. Now my lower back feels good, and it is a relief to me. But it didn't take away the pain in my hips/legs/ankles and my shoulders/neck/arms. I feel down-hearted, darn it.

"Hi everyone
My blood pressure at a recent appointment with rheumatology lead was 188/80, so she has written to my GP suggesting they see me regarding this & sure enough I have been sent an appointment for next week where I am anticipating he will want to put me on anti hypertensives plus probably a statin, as most of them do. I'm not keen on this idea, as doesn't pred raise your blood pressure anyway? I have just reduced to 9mg and after a month on 9 I will do DSNS method of reducing, so I'm thinking that in a couple of months or so I should be at 7 or 7,5 which is body's own natural cortisol levels, so might my BP reduce on its own at that time? I'm looking for any ammunition or argument I can use with GP if anyone has any suggestions.
Many thanks

"I came down with bronchitis and ruptured eardrum 10 days ago, took antibiotics for a week and went up on pred to 10 mg for 5 days. cant see ent for another week. no fever, no chills, etc. after i finished the 10 mg pred on sunday, i dropped back to five-ish which is where i am at the end of the dsns cycle.
today i am weak, congested, miserable all over. lightheaded and dizzy from the ear problem (ongoing since the onset of the bronchitis). so: should i increase the pred again? if so, to what level and for how long? Or should i tough it out until the ent appointment next friday? I understand that you cant treat bronchitis and ruptured eardrums with pred, but i felt a lot better the past few days than i do today. i actually walked a little and sat outside for awhile the past few days; today i can barely get around. not pmr pain and stiffness, rather tight chest, miserable. thanks.

"I posted a few days ago about my bronchitis, prompt care gave me cefdinir (antibiotic) and prednisone. i have a burst eardrum and bronchitis and sinusitis. my ear is draining and im quite deaf, i mean really deaf. cant see ent for 2 weeks.
after 5 days on cefdinir, i was so dizzy i couldnt walk, afraid i would fall. plus i was nauseated and weak. so i quit the cefdinir after 5 days, it has horrible patient reviews anyway. this morning after skipping last nights dose im still dizzy and woozy, but nothing like yesterday. here is my question: i took 10 mg pred for 5 days, which is what the prompt care doc said to do. today is the day i should drop back to my usual dose of 5 mg. is that what i should do? Or should i stay at 10 for a while longer or should i reduce slowly, say 9, 8, 7, etc. (the prompt care doc knew about pmr, but certainly not the dsns method. im pretty sure she thought pmr lasts a year or two.) thank you.

"There is occasional reference in this and another PMR forum about the need for prednisone users to request a synacthen test. I'm not clear as to why.
A definition of the test that I found on the net says this:
""Synacthen is a manufactured drug that acts like adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) by stimulating the adrenal gland to produce more cortisol. By measuring the rise in cortisol in the blood the doctor can see if the adrenal glands are secreting normal amounts of cortisol.""
However, it is my understanding that prednisone users have adrenal glands that are NOT secreting normal amounts of cortisol. So...of what value is the test?
Putting my question on a more personal level:- I am now at the 6.5 mg prednisone level daily.
That is just below the magic 7.0-7.5 level that they say is normal cortisol production. My adrenals should be kicking in a half mg or so to keep me on an even keel. Are they?
Will a synacthen test answer that question?
Hope this posting is not too technical. Any light that you can shine on this subject would be appreciated.

"ive had pmr since september, 2016. currently im on the back half of my dsns taper to 5 mg pred for the second time. for about 2 years now, maybe longer, ive had giant bulging veins in my hands and wrists, very unsightly. my non-pmr girlfriends' hands look nothing like my ugly ones. two weeks ago i upped my pred to 8 mg for 3 days due to returning pain in my pelvic girdle area and then reduced it by 1/2 mg per day until i got back on my dsns journey to 5.
yesterday i noticed all the veins in my hands were normal! i mean they looked halfway decent. and they look almost normal today. im feeling a tad better too, which begs the question: do you think the pop up in pred cleared out some inflammation that had been building up? Ive increased the dosage before, but never noticed any difference at all in the veins in my hands. (of course theres always the pred head thought that my blood isnt flowing as well as it should and i will keel over at any moment. thank you, pred, for those disturbing thoughts.)

"HELLO EVERYONE! I feel a bit foolish asking these questions, I was diagnosed with PMR last March, but I'm so forgetful and seem to have an inability to concentrate.
When I read about all your experiences your all suffering so much, the daily aches and pains, I'm wondering why I don't them. ( dumb hey) Within 24 hours of a severe episode I was diagnosed and on 60 mg. It helped after a few days, and I now reduced to 9mg and holding there out of fear. ( a bit lengthy get to the point). My Doc has never talked to me about PMR only tells me my SED rate and how much Prednisone to take. Here comes the questions,
When you are having your pain is it because your reducing your Pred, or is it despite taking it your still having aches and pains?
Are you all confused, dizzy, unsteady, shaking ( people notice), dry mouth skin and hair, bad nails, cry over sight things and weak. It's hard to shower and do my hair, then my shoulder ache and I do feel weak.But no real pain, and/but I have had two episodes, one minor and one very severe at 7 mg and went up to 20mg as per Doc, now I at 9mg.
I'm a newly wed and he's great but my passion is GONE. UGH!
within the last days I've had a fairly painful ache at the back of my head, behind my ear. regular headache meds don't help, so I took a pain pill I have for my back, and I was able to sleep. PMR GCA? I'm calling PCP requesting blood test.
Of course I don't remember all the questions I wanted to ask, I need to start writing things down. btw I will be getting a new PCP and finally found a Rummy who supposedly know a lot about PMR, appointment next week.
Reading all your posts is so helpful and a bit scary, thank you from the bottom of my heart. And yes I too realize how fortunate we are having Eileen, she truly is our angel!
I'm sure I'll be back!

But now, at this low dosage, I am experiencing stiffness and pain in my upper back and neck, usually first thing in the morning. Is this because my pred at this point is too low, or is it that Pred has been masking other arthritic pains that I may have had, but higher doses covered it? I am 68. My arms hurt today as well, but then I was shoveling snow yesterday! I don't want to take any more pred than necessary. How it does one distinguish PMR pain from aging aches and pains?

"Hello, hoping some of you can advise me on how to manage flareups. It has been about 2 1/2years now that I have had PMR. I was never on a really high dose of Prednisone, started at 20mg. Whenever I go below 15 even by 1/2mg my symptoms return, so I go back to 15 and in a few days to a week am feeling better.
What I am wondering is when you have a flareup and return to the higher dose how long should you wait before you try to reduce again? I am getting very frustrated at trying to reduce and would just like to stay at 15 as my energy leval is pretty decent and I feel well. However I keep getting the message from my rhematologist , family Dr. and even my pharmacist that I need to be decreasing. That is all right for them to say as they have no idea of how it feels to be unable to function properly.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in October 2017 and started on prednisone. From February-December 2018 I had seven asthma flares and chest infections, flu, two bouts of shingles, three DVT's. I'd been pushing hard for a pulmonary referral because of constant breathlessness and wheezing inspite of being on steroids and what I'm told is massive doses of inhaled steroids.
I was eventually seen in Outpatients and a number of tests started. A few things have shown up one of which is low immunity - the reason for all the infections.
Next week I will see the Consultant again to discuss the results if a chest CT and treatment options for the repeated infections. Dr is suggesting either long term antibiotics, or immuno-therapy.
Is anyone having treatment for low immunity? If so what? I'm thinking that immuno-therapy is probably nit the best treatment for someone with PMR. Any thoughts? Thank you.

"It's 4 am and I am about to take my 8 mg of prednisone before going back to bed to snuggle down again. Before going to sleep last night I took the third dose of CBD oil which I hope will help me to taper the prednisone. February marks the beginning of my 5th year of PMR. Because I have been unable to taper below 8 mg without a flare the Rheumy wanted me to take plaquenil as a steroid sparer and when I refused she kind of lost interest in me. My GP suggested that I apply for a licence for medical cannabis. Meantime I made an appointment with a Pain Specialist in the hope that I would be able to get a licence to try medical cannabis - but he seemed to know little about PMR and even less about cannabis. He said that I wouldn't get a licence until I had been unsuccessful for a year of trying narcotics and analgesics for the pain. Since I refused to go down that route he wished me luck and farewell. And now, with 20 kgs of extra weight, stiff joints, aching body, wheezy breathing, low energy and feeling like an old woman with a raging appetite I decided to try the CBD route. I ordered the cbd oil from a reputable uk company - It is expensive but if it works and I manage to taper the steroids maybe I will regain my health. Maybe I will be able to exercise again and walk at a normal pace.I finally came to the sad conclusion for me that I no longer have the physical stamina to work and - though I am telling my clients that I am taking time off - I don't believe I will ever be able to work again. This is maybe the most difficult admission to make - and I am struggling with that reality.As my 70th birthday approaches and I can't keep up with my toddler grandchild, I am angry and frustrated and wonder what will be.......

1st) I'm in the process of tapering (again).....I'm at 10.5mg and have been for about 1wk. the past several days, I've been waking up feeling terribly nauseous. about 20-30m after I take the pred, I seem to feel better. so far, no other symptoms! does this sound familiar to anyone else?
Also, I'm in one of those ""it never rains, it pours"" fazes.
last week I had another ct scan as my pulmonologist is baffled why I'm having more problems with my shortness of breath. she tested for a lung clot and thank God it came back clear. however, what they DID find was a nodule on my thyroid (which was not even on my radar!).
now, I've got yet another appointment with a new doc to see what that's all about!
UGHhhh.....it's always something and as usual I'm anxious.
I hope all you fine folks are doing well and had a good holiday season.

"A few days ago i posted about my abdominal pain which was poor wording--it actually should have been entitled pelvic girdle pain which has plagued me long before the onset of pmr. and it was made much worse by a labral tear in my hip in 2011. it did get better with physical therapy which i will do again when i get home in 2 months.
Question #1: anyway, in my previous post i talked about how bad the pain in my pelvic area was...so a few days later i upped my pred to 8 mg for 3 days and poof! the pain was greatly reduced and i felt a lot better. I was using the dsns to get to 5 mg. so now i am reducing 1/2 mg per day to get back to where i was...is that an ok approach? im just not sure.
Question #2: it feels like my old labral tear pain may be flaring again. ive read several previous posts about how old injuries and physical problems rear their ugly head with pmr. certainly my muscles are weaker which would account for the resurgence in my pelvic area weakness. have any of you experienced this--the resurfacing of old problems? trust me, exercising, even the mildest, aint working--it seems to make things worse. thank you.

I was diagnosed with early osteoarthritis in my neck and spine, also knees, by a rheumatologist approx. two years ago. No special meds just otc pain killers. I tried physio but felt worse after it, light headed.
I have had neck aches, headaches, lightheadedness on and off since, good and bad days.
About five weeks ago I had the flu and pneumonia jabs in my left arm. My arm was sore for several days and I didn't feel well for a couple of weeks. For a few days now my right shoulder has been stiff and painful also the top my right arm and my neck. I also have aches in my lower back but I have had this before over the years. Is there any way of distinguishing PMR from osteoarthritis?
I'm stiff in the mornings but loosen up after a while but my neck ache is usually there and now too my shoulder aches and pains. I have lost over a stone in weight this past year but my appetite isn't what it was before my diagnosis. Bloods done in June were normal, no rheumatoid arthritis.

"Hi all,
I'm into my 4 year and on a 2nd taper after getting to 0 two years ago and then relapsing. I'm 67 and like so many of you, have always been active. My PMR is mainly hip with stiff knees and carpal tunnel in both wrists. I was merrily tapering along on the DSND method and reached the 6.0 step but I knew the inflammation was building. After contracting a cold, I could feel the impact of the additional burden and had to reset at 10 mg for 3 days. Im now restarting my taper at 8.0.
I'd slowly started to narrow my feeding window to eating only between noon and 7:00 pm and I felt pretty good up until the cold. I'm now planning to gradually narrow my feeding window again, as soon as I'm sure 8.0 mg is a reliable taper start point.
Here are my queries.
First, is the fast broken by taking prednisone with a tbsn of skyr yogurt?
Second, someone I read online referred to intermittent fasting (IF) as prednisone without the side effects. Do any of my partners in PMR out there have experience with intermittent fasting? I would welcome your thoughtful expertise whether you've tried it or not.

In the two and a half years since taking prednisone I have had eight fractured bones including three fractures in one location. I've also turned from pre-diabetic to diabetic. All because of the prednisone. so I am very happy to be off and I really think my PMR went into remission a few months ago but I wanted to taper very slowly because I did not want it to come out of remission. so think happy thoughts for me and I will think good thoughts about you as well.

"Over the last 16 months I have, with the help of my Doctor, managed to bring my dose of steroid down from 60mg a day to 5mg a day. Sadly I have had to return to a 15mg dose due to my inflammation levels increasing.
I feel very very tired and have aching tired neck & shoulders, as well as aching spine and hips. I have also been very clumsey and tend to be rather irattic when I walk. I have dizzy spells and do get headaches. As well as PMR I also have GCA plus I have bad anxiety.
Are all the symtoms quite usual with these conditions?
Any advice would be much appreciated - Thank you

"I am in year 4, started at 20 mg which I staying on for 5 months before starting to reduce. I have had a few flares along the way, but I am finally down to 1.5 but it has taken three months to get there from 2 mg and I am still experiencing pain in my thighs and shoulders especially after any amount of sitting. My doctor thinks I have developed some type of atrophy in my legs and its not PMR any longer. (SED went from 64 on diagnoses to 20 now). I am doing yoga and curling 3-4 days a week, with walks when the weather allows. Every time I try and exercise I find myself in more pain. Activity makes it worse, yet I am determined to get back in shape and lose the 40 pounds I have gained while on pred. My doctor wants me off pred (two months ago) as my blood sugars are creeping up and my blood pressure and heart issues are finally under control (with medication). My gut tells me the prednisone is hurting my body more than it is helping, so I would like to safely make the next reduction. My question is about the muscle atrophy. Has anyone experienced this and worked their way back to muscle strength?

"I am using dsns to get to 5 mg. pred. onset of pmr was sept. 2015. lately i have been tired and sore, moving slow (as i put it) and not able to as much as i did my first couple years. figured it is the adrenals being sluggish. however, i am experiencing lower abdominal pain after exercising--and my ability to exercise isnt very much. a little walking every day, some days i can do my little pmr exercises suggested at the front of this forum, sometimes i cant. i do what i can.
lately i have lower pelvic pain that i havent had before--its not like the pain i had at the onset of pmr--that was in my groin and down into my legs. this pain is relieved with icing, and follows movement. its not everyday.
it seems to me that i read on one of the forums that others have had it (please tell me that you have!) and that it had to do with the general weakening of the muscles due to pmr.dr. google says that my pelvic floor is going to collapse. im turning to all of you for solace. i want to know whether anyone else has ever experienced this. thank you.

"Im on a roll today, asking two questions. first, correction: i got pmr in 2016, not 2015, as stated incorrectly in my previous post. here is this question: decades before i got pmr, i had chronic pain, to make a long story short, ive seen 80 doctors across the u.s., been to mayo twice, had horrible things done to me, nothing helped. was always told ""pain causes inflammation."" blood work always perfect, until the onset of pmr. bloodwork is now perfect again, but of course i have pmr and i still have the same chronic pain that i had pre-pmr, (interesting to note that over the years i also saw psychics, soothsayers, healers, acupuncturists, etc., every single one, i seldom told them why i was there, all said across the board: ""you are burning up with inflammation."" as an aside, none of them helped but i always thought their pronouncements were spot on). anyway, since i have this preexisting chronic pain and we know pain causes inflammation, can i ever recover from pmr, do you think? im using dsns, currently going to 5 mg pred. thanks!

"Hi,
I'm interested in members' experience of having a cold whilst taking steroids. I'm a little shocked by how long it is taking me to recover from what I'm sure is a bad cold, not flu. I've had it one week and still have so little energy and other typical symptoms. I'm currently taking 10mg having tapered down from 15mg since May last year. I am usually very active and full of beans. I'm assuming this prolonged illness is due to a suppressed immune system but wanted to hear from others about their experiences. Thank you

"I recently reduced from 8 mg to 7 mg using the DSNS method. When I got to 7, I experienced
exhaustion for about 2 weeks. Now I'm doing better, though still tired (no return of pain). A few questions:
--Was the exhaustion due to pred withdrawal or due to adrenals taking time to kick in? Will the tiredness eventually fade? How long might it take, on average?
--I'd like to try reducing further. Would it be wise to try the next step of the reduction now, or should I wait between reductions? If I should wait, how long? A few weeks? Until tiredness goes away?
--Since I will be using the DSNS method, which is very slow and gradual, would reducing by 1 mg to 6 mg be reasonable? Or should I reduce by only 1/2 mg to 6 1/2? People have mentioned not reducing by more than 10% on this forum, but I had the impression that was if you were doing a straightforward reduction all at once, not with the DSNS method.
Thanks for all your help.

"This has probably been answered before, but what tests did you all take to get the PMR diagnosis? I have regular blood tests, and most are not flagged, except the SED rate which is consistantly above 40. IN the last year the number has been up to the 60 and more when I try to cut down on the prednisone. So when I look at my graph, the numbers are about 40 or 50 if I am taking 30mg pred, and 60 or more if I go down to 20mg of pred.
My doctor now wants to test my heart to see if it is enlarged. She thinks the high SED rate 69 this time is due to a yeast infection. OK, but the infection was gone when I took the test. Also how come the SED is high all year = I haven't had infections all year? She also mentioned my shoulder pain was fibromyalgia. This I can accept, but I think I read that fibro doesn't have high inflammation?

"Polymyalgia after 3 years……………. December 2018
At Christmas Miss Poly
will be three years old
Mr Pred who’s the steroid,
He helps with the load
I’m now down to 6
Which proved very slow
And the drop for one week
Leaves me feeling quite low
There’s only one answer
to keep me pain free
Take two thirds in bed
And one third after tea
I’m lucky I guess
Mr Pred does his stuff
He works really hard
Then I don’t feel too rough
And when I bounce back
from the horrible drop
I’m out and about
And I try not to stop
I see all my friends,
try to have a good time
But I’m careful to cut
down carbs, sugar and wine
And as I drop down
I am hoping to see
A gradual improvement
and find the old me
And eventually make it
to down under 5
And feel more normal,
be completely alive
So all of us live
with eternal hope
And battle the demon
and try hard to cope
Remember that star
burns up high in the sky
So we mustn’t complain
and ask reasons why
Happy Christmas to All
and a Happy New Year
Let’s all face the future
with cheer and less fear
We’ll raise glasses high
and give a High Five
And just thank the Lord
we are all still alive

"Hi all, I'm the mess who tries to cut down on pred. and never succeeds. The last two months I was at ;20mg and suffering from pain as well as out of breath problems, which I don't know why. As soon as I went back up to25 one day 30 the next, I got a little better. Then last week when I had my lab tests, my SED rate was way up to 69, 2nd highest it has been. It is usually around45 with the pred. I took the lab tests after my lunch and the glucose showed 214, which the dr said was prediabetes. My rheumatologist says I must cut down on the pred. and it is causing all my problems, weight gain, diabetes, etc. I feel like I'm dying. I don't want to go on sometimes. I wish I could be helped somehow.

"Hello fellow PMR sufferers. I live in that crazy country that switched us off from the world for a week, Zimbabwe. Last night the Internet servers won a High Court ruling against the government to resume the cyber link and I have been catching up with your posts.
I see that the Foum's future may be at a crossroad. I hope there is no danger of closure. It was a lifeline to me on diagnosis nearly five years ago when I was bewildered and frightened and very alone. I seldom post now because I feel so hopeless about this wretched and relentless PMR. That two-year burn out marker was like the Holy Grail and as it disappeared in the mist of time, the pain continued, the Pred wrought its horrible side effects and I sunk into a PMR induced depression which I didn't think fair to burden members with. But I am still an avid Forum reader and gain so much, especially from the contributions of those who have licked the monster.
I fervently hope the Forum continues and its most valuable members are able to continue giving their priceless advice, support and fellowship to those with PMR. BRAVO to you all.

"I've had PMR for 3 years and am currently at 6.5 mg pred. The diagnosis was spot on and correct. There is no doubt I've got it. I've never been lower then 6.5mg. I have no side effects. I've had flares which I believe were induced by too much exercise. I'm reducing 0.5 mg per month and for the first time I'm quite confident the ""polly"" as I like to call this evil condition is under control.
I've just seen a Professor of Rheumatology, I'm in the UK. He says its not PMR. PMR never lasts more than 2 years. We all know this is wrong. I've had numerous MRI scans and the pain is not from any spinal problems. He tried to frighten me that I was at risk of muscle myopathy, but I have no tiredness and feel reasonably fit.
He want me to go onto amiltriptyline for a month. Continue on it while I reduce steroids by I mg per month and manage the pain with cocodamol (codeine and paracetamol). I would also go to pain management classes. I will be seeing one of his staff to organise all this.
I have some questions
Eileen. You're the source of all PMR knowledge. Can you give me reference for the stats on how long PMR lasts. I remember you quoting something like 70% of people are off pred after 4 years. I'd like to have the document to show at my next appointment
Has anybody had experience of amyltriptyline in their treatment? How did you get on?

"Hello, I have had PMR for 3 years 5 months. Started on the usual high dose which worked in hours. Gradually reduced and apart from three flares, managed to reduce using the dead slow method to 5mg per day back in June. I have suffered with fatigue previously and have had my B12 checked and all ok. Back in June I had a horrible two weeks of severe nausea and awful dizziness, the only way of helping was lying very still. GP diagnosed labrynthitis and prescribed meds which made me feel worse so stopped those. Anyway after 2 weeks, things eased. Unfortunately the nausea returned, so horrible, as did the dizziness. Lots of investigations, ENT specialist confirmed no problems with ears and suggested none of the meds prescribed would help. GP still at a loss. In November, I picked up a couple of viruses and during that time, the nausea eased. The nausea came back but much shorter bursts (at the moment !) the dizziness and extreme fatigue however are worse than ever.
I am now down to 2/2.5 per day, very little or no pain. Is it possible that my adrenal glands are still not back to normal? I did presume it was at 6 or 7mg that your own adrenal glands should kick back in after being on hold so is it at all feasible that mine are ""on hold"" and possibly causing these symptoms?

My lone side effect from pred is bleeding under the skin. I wonder whether spending a few months on a higher than necessary pred dose really matters. After all, if the PMR is diminishing, future tapering should be easier. Am I right?

"hello all,
been reading a bit through the forums just to get a better sense of the possibility that this is what i might have and to see if i can get any other information or advice seeing as i've only been to an urgent care and still don't have a official diagnosis yet.
i understand i am pretty young to have gca, and that the likelihood is that i might have takayasu instead if anything even at all, but i seem to have most if not all of the cranial symptoms of gca so i'm not quite sure what to make of everything just yet.
CRP is 3.7 and ESR is 6 so i believe those are normal results for the blood tests. however my symptoms have been pretty alarming and i have been put on 60mg of prednisone immediately and got a referral for an appointment at a vascular surgeon tomorrow for further evaluation and possible biopsy if needed.
about 2 weeks ago i was chewing on a taffy like candy and my temples and jaw were painful. on touch i noticed they seemed a bit swollen and i ran up to a mirror and was frightened by how swollen they were.
every day since then i have been getting painful and swollen temples as well as moderate to severe headache around the sinus area and temples after almost all of my meals.
there doesn't seem to be too many other options for this particular and severe of a symptom besides possibly TMD. however after researching GCA and Takayusa's some more i realized several other of the symptoms also fit but were vague enough to be other issues but tied together with the temporal swelling seemed to indicate GCA.
i have been having general flu-like, fatigue, and soreness symptoms as well as shortness of breath and vertigo for a few months, but myself and other doctors chalked most of that up to the winter season and not being in the best shape.
now a little concerned where it ties into the possibility of Takayusa's because i've had minor pain in my chest by my left clavicle and pain/numbness down my left arm for a few months as well.
not entirely sure what to make of all this or what to expect going forward in the pursuit of further evaluation and diagnosis, but i would appreciate any questions or advice that might help me navigate a bit for the next few days and weeks to come.
thanks in advance,

Called 12/27 begged for a name of another doc, told to go to hospital, but i couldnt think about getting out of bed, pain was a 10. girl said he might call in. 12/28 called office again, he didnt call in, told go to hospital. i started to take naproxen, and codiene, no help. 12/29 pain was 9 i went to hospital, never had more pain n my life. Hospital took xray, nothing. i asked doc to take blood for my sed rate, it had increased 11 points in 1 week. doc said she knew nothing about PRM but to increase my pred from 7 to 20mg, see my PCP. pain was about 8/1/2. i waited until after NY day and called pcp, new girl said of course we had coverage, come in at 11:30, i said not possible could doc call me. she said yes, at 1:30.
never called. i called next day, girl promised he'd call, didnt . called today, freaked at office manager after she told me that doc had left a note to tell me to make an appointment next week. I just wanted my Pcp to tell me if the sed increase caused my pain. i have never had a relapse so didnt know what to expect . its friday my pain has reduced enough to get out of bed, but after 10 mins. leg pain returns. my question to the group is, what does relapse pain feel like, and does PMR cause sciatica. thanks for taking the time to go thru all of this, and any help you can give me.

"I'd appreciate some thoughts/comments regarding Alendronate (Fosamax) 70mg. Just over 2 years ago I was diagnosed with PMR by my GP. I was sent to a rheumy and my rheumy #1 did a DEXA scan on me 2 weeks after I had started taking prednisone, and said I had Osteopenia so he had me take Alendronate 70mg once a week and I've been taking that dose ever since for the past 2 years.
In the 2 years since I started this journey I've gone through a real process and have tried to stay more in control of my treatment as specialists have caused as many problems as they've solved. I saw rheumy #3 last fall and basically ""fired"" him by not scheduling the next appointment after he wanted to add NSAIDs to my pred dose and said this would help to ""speed up my reduction"".
Now for my current problem: My Alendronate prescription is running out very shortly and my GP wants me to go back to Rheumy #3 about the Alendronate and possibly another DEXA scan. I can do this but Rheumy #3 is then going to find out that I ignored everything from the previous appointment and have continued on perfectly well with the very slow prednisone reduction. That could bring a real firestorm between us.
My gut instinct is that the original Osteopenia diagnosis is most likely my natural condition because I'd barely been on pred at the time of the DEXA scan. I'm also hesitant to continue on the alendronate after 2 years but can't really give a good reason why except that I know that sometime in the next 1-2 years it's likely that there's going to be some dental extractions. Maybe I'm just making something out of nothing.
Any thoughts one way or the other regarding the continued use of alendronate?

"Hi all, I had PMR for 5 or so years and was taking prednisolone for all that time, finishing up on one mg for 6 months then none. That was in August. Today I've just got back from the doctors with a prescription, I've got to start all over again. PMR has returned (if it ever went away) with a vengeance. About 3 weeks ago I started aching and put it down to age, but on Christmas Day the aches and pains took on a familiar feeling. There is nothing that feels the same as PMR, it's unique.
My question to the forum is....how do we know if and when we have got over PMR. I was absolutely certain that I was over it but have been proved wrong.

"When first diagnosed with pmr 3 years ago my bone density showed osteopenia and my rheumatologist wanted me on fosamax. AFTER 3 weeks I couldn't STAND IT AND my BITE AND TEETH MOVED. So I STUCK WITH THE CALCIUM BUT NOT MUCH VIT d. The hip bursitis was really troublesome before I was diagnosed with pmr; I had many steroid hip injections.
Yesterday my bone density showed the above diagnosis. I HAVE BEEN TAKING THE MICRONUTRIENT protocol as described in a successful study which actually reversed osteoporosis after one year. I have only been trying that protocol for less than 6 months with my rheumy's approval. NOW i am wondering if I should try FORTEO or just continue with the protocol . I am exercising as much as I can with the easy fatiguability. I am tapering to 8.5 currently.
There was a period of time when I COULD HARDLY EXERCISE BECAUSE OF bilateral bursitis and reactive airway disease.

Any hints, tips etc.
After a bad year of new and ever changing health problems, then a new Doctor who wants me off pred yesterday, and then after reading Dan rowers recent post, I made a rash decision and bought a return flight to Argentina, to get myself back out into the world, and fight my desire to become a recluse.
Then I saw the long list of immunisations our Govt sees as necessary for this journey. Hmmmm, I suspect they might not all mix well with pred so I have decided, not to get any.

"Hello everyone,
It's been a year now since officially being declared in remission from PMR. Emotionally and mentally it's been a great place to be. No more preds! Slowly throughout the year I've lost a stone in weight so I'm moving about more and a lot easier but it hasn't all been plain sailing. Whilst on the very low doses of preds I noticed pain appearing in my right hip that over last Christmas was unbearable. Following visits to the GP I was referred to a physiotherapist who declared that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my hip but my problem lay with my right side lower back muscles. I was given a strict daily regime of exercises to follow and the pain has improved no end. Obviously I have the odd day especially when I've over done things but on a subsequent visit to my GP he did ask if I'd suffered from a right hand side back issue in the past. I replied I had many many years ago and he immediately replied that whilst on reasonable levels of preds these drugs were able to mask any inflammatory issues with these damaged muscles but once I reached very low levels and then none there was nothing helping this existing injury. He added that the combination of the pre existing injury (that was basically long term damaged muscles) plus the weakness caused to the muscles from the PMR and the preds it would take a while for them to become strong again and that my daily gentle exercises would probably be necessary for a long while yet.
I'm telling you this story because it's important to understand that not every pain we get is a symptom of PMR. Because the condition and the medication weakens our muscles to a degree old existing injuries are more likely to be exposed, but that correct gentle daily exercise could help enormously.
Obviously I'm hoping to continue losing more weight and at the same time work to get myself healthier by more gentle exercise.
My PMR journey was peppered with diagnosis mistakes initially but once under a consultant who by the way embraced the dead slow and almost stop method of reduction was not too bad an ordeal. I was diagnosed at 52 and my journey in total including 2 flares took 5 years, so there's hope for everyone. But, as Elaine always says the condition dictates the level of medication and not the medication that dictates the condition. These forums helped me enormously and I still read members posts and I'm so pleased they're here with members who offer wise words and advise.
All that remains for me to do is send you all the warmest of Cornish Best Wishes for Christmas and the Coming New Year. With Kind Regards, Tina.

"To-day is the Lucia Day in Sweden. She comes with candles in her hair and in her hand. She enlightens us in the darkest period of the year with light and songs. This morning, I didn´t have time to watch TV programmes with Lucia and ""Star boys"" accompanying her as I had to go to rehab early. I thought back at celebration of Lucia when we went to school and when the children celebrated Lucia. If you are interested to find out more you can google Lucia in Sweden and also find songs on Youtube**.
On December 13 in 2008, I got off pred after 3 ½ years of pmr and GCA. I had found out a new way of tapering slower than before and finally got off pred. I chose to say that I did it on December 13 - the Lucia Day in Sweden, because it is easy to remember and it also is a positive day. For us who have or have had pmr and/or GCA it is nice to know that Lucia is there with a light at the end of the tunnel. I have now been off pred for 10 years and I hope when you read this that it helps you all thinking about a happy end soon.
At last, I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

"I have been with my Primary Care Physician for 13 years. Recently he mailed a letter announcing that he is retiring. He is in a practice with 2 other physicians. One is a DO and is elderly and still working at age 79. The practice is looking for another Dr. to take over my Dr's patients but are asking patients to find another provider in case it takes a long time to find a replacement. Months ago my current Dr. suggested I see a Rheumy too. I asked what more can a Rheumy do for me and I believe he said it would be drugs that he is not qualified to prescribe, such as Methotrexate. I declined the referral.
I had an appointment with a new Dr. yesterday. He knew of PMR but admitted it was limited but knew the duration was 1 1/2 years to 5. After reading everything on this forum for the last 13 months I think I impressed him with my knowledge. He seems open to me taking Pred as needed to control the symptoms while reducing, but he also asked why I haven’t been seen by a Rheumy. I said it was because I didn't think I needed drugs such as Methotrexate. My question: What might I be missing out on by not seeing a Rheumy? I am willing to see one if I know what else there might be gained.

"ctorQuestion12-11-2018
Has Anyone experience of this?
I think my problems in my legs started four years ago, after spending a life incredibly fit (I am an ex professional horse rider and still walked up to 10 miles per day) I started to get a sensation in my left thigh as if a few muscle fibres were tearing on lifting a heavy weight, the sensation would disappear as quickly as it arrived and left no symptoms or muscle weakness. This continued on for months until one day I ran down the stairs and tore an inch and a half hole through the soleus,gastrocnemius and fascia of my left calf. I had extensive physio but continued to advise that my leg did not feel right but felt as if it would re-tear at any given moment. The doctors and the physio told me that I was wrong and that it was fine. I continued to walk until 19mths later and it re-tore, I also felt at the time that my right calf had also torn in the same place but on ulta sound the left showed the tear but the right showed nothing. I continued with physio until four months later when the leg tore again and then proceeded to get worse. At this time also my leg was a blueish colour and foot cold. Trying any type of rehabilitation immediately resulted in a set back until the same pain came in the right leg and I was on knee pads and crawling with not a good leg to stand on. To cut a long story short, after a succession of private medial tests and MRI scans I am still unable to walk any great length or at full speed. I now suffer with random pains in my thighs and legs, from the feelings of electric shocks to be kicked in the muscles, dull throbbing aches and tenderness. Also my left calf muscle has now deteriorated and my tendon is clearly visible but I have no diagnosis and have been advised that there will not be one forth coming. Whether its related or not I dont know but Ive also had hair loss and scalp itch, again investigated but told there will be no diagnosis so it continues on.
I am desperate for help now, Ive had MRI scans, blood tests, a needle pushed into my muscles to determine the electrical activity, an electrical current held on each nerve, checked out by the vascular surgeon and also my back checked but all drew a blank. The specialists all proclaim that they have never seen the like as all the way through I have held on to full muscle power. Even the pain specialist had never seen it.
All thoughts and experiences are welcome.
Thank you in advance.

"I was diagnosed last November with PMR and started on 20Mg of Prednisone. It relieved the pain
immediately, and I have slowly been reducing the dose. I was on 8.5 mg on 3/30/14 and started using Eileen H's slow reduction method. I was in the midst of the reduction schedule and took 7.5 on 4/23. The next morning I was in agony. I took an 8.5 dose that day and wasn't completely better when I went to bed. However, this morning I woke with only mild stiffness that disappeared with an 8.5 dose. My question is how common is it to have a flare-up or does it indicate that 7.5 is too low for me. I really was hoping to get off of the prednisone. Any comments would be appreciated.

"I thought I'd start a new post on my experience of tapering off pred so far. its now just over a year since I went to my GP with bilateral shoulder and hip/thigh aches and stiffness, and will soon be the anniversary of my relationship with prednisolone. I responded reasonably well to 15mg with almost instant and complete relief in hip/thighs and shoulders within a week. Had some side effects from pred notably anxiety but this subsided after a taper in stages down to 10 by end of April. As Ive reported before Rheumatologist advised a quicker taper of 1mg every 3 weeks at end of May, mainly as glycemic control was a concern. followed this plan until end of July until on 6mg. At that point I started getting bilateral hamstring pain especially when sitting, not every day and it came and went. No noticeable stiffness. After 3 weeks I tried a drop to 5.5mg, after which I had 2 weeks of the thigh pain, again no stiffness and fatigue. It then seemed to resolve and so after 2 more weeks I reduced to 5mg. thigh pain returned on and off but no noticeable stiffness. Beginning of October i tried a reduction to 4.5mg Thigh pain and mild and inconsistent shoulder aches were the result. Stick it out for a while then GP suggested going back to 5. Did that but no difference so I'm now on 6. most days good, no stiffness to speak of but hamstring aches still come on some days but not stiffness, feel much better generally. GP advised to stick on 6 until after Xmas and see how i feel. GP thinks taper was too fast and this led to me not being able to accurately say at what dose I was last completely pain free (that and me occasionally over doing it.) Thinking back was probably best on 7 but currently happy on 6.
Wont be reducing again though until 100% or there abouts. I wondered whether others had experienced similar esp. the pain on tapering without stiffness and the hamstring pain. I don't really remember the pain in my legs before pred, stiffness was my main problem in that area and pain and stiffness in my shoulders. In any event nothing I have now compares to the state I was in a year ago.

"I am 63 and approx 2 months ago I started to experience symptoms which mimic the same symptoms those of you have been diagnosed with PMR have. This was sudden and a few days after receiving the flu shot. Extreme pain getting out of bed, walking down steps, unable to raise shoulders, buttock and hip pain. I saw a nurse practicioner who did blood work. I had an elevated ESR. She started me on a steroid and symptoms seemed to get better. Symptoms returned so I saw a doctor for my next visit. He did more blood work and put me on a 20 day regimen of prednisone : 40 mg for five days, then 30, then,20, then 10. I did have an elevated CRP rate. After I stopped the 20 day regimen, the symptoms returned so back to the doctor. This time, he orderes xrays of neck, shoukders, back and hips showing so e degeneration in the neck area. He did not say anything about a follow up visit. I think he is calling it muskuloskeletal pain and thinks it will go away. I have scheduled another appointment with another physician who has more experience in this area but cant see him for 3 weeks.
I will be off prednisone for approximately a week before I can see new doctor. Rheumatologists are booked for at least 9 months. if anyone could give me some recommendations on further tests, mri,s scans etc. I would greatly appreciate it. i have never experienced anything like this before. I am usually stiff and in pain for approximately 3 to 4 hours in the am, feel better rest of the day, start to get stiff at night, can't sleep through the night because the pain wakes you up, then it starts all over again. The pain never goes away, just gets tolerable during the day.

"I've had problems with lifting my right arm ever since I was diagnosed 2 years ago, but in the last couple of months my shoulder and upper arm muscles have got really painful, and keep me awake at night. I've been going to a sports physio who gives me exercises and manipulates and massages it, and my range of movement has improved but not the painfulness. I try not to use it too much, but that is difficult - I've tried upping my pred dose from 6 to 7.5 which was my last 'happy' dose for 4 days, no change. Tried stopping the exercises, no change. 2 paracetamols in the morning dull it for a little while. Has anyone else managed to find a treatment that worked for them? I'd be glad to hear of your experiences.

He was diagnosed mid June PMR/GCA and left the asseement unit on 40mg pd.
At time of scan he was on 25 - 22.5mg reduction week and is currently taking 20mg about to star a reduction to 17.5 (admittedly a slower rate than GP was suggesting in September).

He's comfortable on current pred reduction rate.

"I've started a new thread as Kate's original question re PMR or old back pain has had lots of replies and I feel my experience/query, although in some ways similar will make it all a bit unwieldy and some of what I want to say is irrelevant to the original post.
I must have had osteo arthritis for more than thirty years. It began with my hands which are now what you might call gnarled.  I first noticed pain which made playing the piano for the children in my school uncomfortable but I managed for a while. Then I retired and no longer played. At this stage there was no swelling; that came later and when it did my hands became stiffer and stiffer but less and less painful. My feet are now going the same route and I hobble a bit when I first get up. As the day goes on it all eases and by evening I feel pretty well ok but only if I keep moving. Sit still for an hour and I creak.
To a lesser extent I have pain in one knee and also lower back or it could be hip, not sure.  This could be attributable to too much gardening, of course, or plain old age. Or could some of it be PMR? So I have at least four possibilities. 
There are days when I think almost fondly of PMR and the steroids that kept them all at bay! But my last ESR came back as 3 which I know doesn't prove anything but doesn't make Pred. look like the first thing to try.
I cannot take paracetamol and have never tried any NSAIDs and given my track record I'm not keen to do so.  I suppose if I did try and all the pains went then I'd know it's not PMR.
Perhaps I ought to post this under Arthritis. But that's where I came in; how to tell which pain?

"Have had PMR for 2 years now. Started at 15 mg of prednisone and symptoms were dramatically improved w/n 24 hours. Have been struggling with trying to reduce using the DSNS method and with multiple ups and downs and switching to methylprednisolone have now settled at 12.5mg.
Several weeks ago I started to have severe lower back pain. Went for an MRI and a had a consult with a pain management specialist and was told I have a stress fracture of my L5 vertebrae. No history of trauma so it's a fairly good chance it's from osteoporosis related to the methylprednisolone.
I am guessing my rheumy will want to put me on a bisphosphonate which I do not want to take ( on too many other meds for other issues ).
Ideally I would love to reduce or stop the methylprednisolone but as you know it's a Catch 22 situation.
I would appreciate your thoughts on what I should do since I feel trapped and would also love to hear from others regarding your experience, both positive and negative, with bisphosphonates.

"The dentist discovered my tooth had rotted underneath a crown and needs to be pulled. I have the choice between a bridge and an implant to replace the tooth. The implant requires bone growth in the jaw to hold the implanted screw in place. Prednisone is a risk factor, since healing may not proceed at normal speed. Also osteopenia is a risk factor, which I have.
I haven't noticed any difficulty healing with bruises since I've been on pred (almost a year now, currently on 8 mg). I think I would prefer the implant, if my body will be able to heal and grow bone as required. Does anyone have experience with this?

"its been 6 months now since I last posted, I'm surprised how fast time has gone. Last time i had reduced to 9.5mg pred and had a few twinges after doing so but eventually these went away. i was still suffering from some anxiety and blood tests showed i had gone from very low risk of diabetes a year before to pre-diabetic, that was in April. At the end of that month i saw my Rheumatologist who advised me to try a faster taper of 1mg every 3 weeks as he was concerned about my glycemic control. i followed this (more or less) until i reached 6mg in mid july. At that point there was no anxiety, and glucose levels back to normal. naturally i over did things a bit also and had some pain in backs of my thighs appear when resting or walking up steep hills. i decided as my Gp was away and next rheumatology appointment not for months to slow down the taper reducing 0.5mg every 3 or so weeks depending on the result, well that was the plan anyway! So when pain free i reduced to 5.5mg and was rewarded with some aches in backs of both thighs and both groins, the later felt like joint pain ie hurt moving legs apart etc. i was also very tired for about 10 days after the reduction. Once feeling better (although not completely pain free at all times) i tried 5mg at beginning of September. in truth this wasnt too bad with some of the aforementioned hip area pain on occaision but no stiffness at all. So at beginning of October i tried 4.5mg. While i have no recognisable side effects from the pred and blood tests all are better than ever, i have slowly developed some mild shoulder aches on both sides that comes and goes, especially after exercise and the hip pain is more consistent (although exercise helps with that). none of this is disabling like the pain and stiffness this time last year before I started pred at XMAS but i am worried that this might get worse again and I'm certainly not ready to try any further reductions. My GP is happy for me to decide and there is still no sign of next Rheumatology appointment. I'd be really interested in comments from those of you with more experience than me both on whether these milder pain/aches without noticeable stiffness is something others get when tapering too quickly (or whether we just put up with this sort of thing) and at what point i should try increasing the dose slightly or should i just stick it out?

"With PMR, I tapered quickly to 7mg but have been stuck there for the last six months, moving to 8 mg only yesterday. On just 0.5mg tapers, I had hoped my symptoms were pred withdrawal but, a week later, symptoms were always worsening. So, today, I Googled adrenal gland awakening and was astonished to read this from two websites of The Imperial Centre for Endocrinology:
""If you look at old textbooks and websites, you will see that in the past, people thought that 7.5mg was the equivalent amount of prednisolone that you need in a day, but we now know that this is too much and is much closer to 3mg. Even doses of 3-7.5 mg therefore have the potential to cause side effects.""
“We know that patients who have no adrenal glands feel fine on 3mg-4mg prednisolone so that is the equivalent of what your adrenal glands make daily. If you feel unwell as you cut the dose before you reach 4mg, that would suggest that your primary vasculitis is not fully in remission. However if you get down to 3mg, then reducing the dose further requires your own adrenal glands to be in working order.”
So I guess I am stuck at 7mg through PMR inflammation alone, which makes future treatment simpler.

"Hi,
I've been following a low carb diet for only one week now, the reason being to try to lose/maintain weight. I'm not sure if I've read this on the forum and already forgotten!!! but I'm fairly sure that it is having an impact on symptoms, in that there is an improvement. Having said that, I have next to no symptoms, more of a very, very mild awareness of some slight stiffness at times, which might not even be PMR related. I'm in the middle of my third attempt (slow DSNS) to go from 11mg to 10mg. My question is about whether a low carb diet is expected to have an impact on symptoms?
A second question is that I'm using diet.dr/low carb as recommended on this forum which I'm finding quite high in fat (love it!!) but this makes it high in calories - should I try to keep calories under control as well as carbs. Like most on this forum, I'm of an age whereby high fat, highish calories are just a real 'no no' for weight loss. I understand that any weight loss will be extremely slow. Thanks for your input.

"Diagnosed with PMR last April and started successfully on 15mg prednisolone, I've since had 2 unsuccessful attempts to reach 10mg, (once was direct from 15 to 10 due to silly GP!! and once via dsns from 12.5) and am currently on 11mg. Have been experiencing lots of stiffness but only in the mornings and so very reluctant to attempt a third time to try to get to 10. Finally decided to give splitting of the dose a go, taking 2.5mg at night and 8.5mg in the morning - hallelujah - that works so well. This is my third day and I have no more stiffness in the mornings. I can't believe I've been so stupid not to try this earlier. I feel ready soon to have my third attempt and will probably do 2.5 p.m and 7.5am Just wanted to share my story of success for anyone else who also only experiences morning symptoms.

"I've just finished my 2nd year with PMR as my friend. I'd had difficulty getting past 10 mg of prednisone until I went fully with the DSNS reduction, dropping .5 mg about every 7-8 weeks. Very slow but really can't complain as there have been few bad days. Just have been accepting the pred side effects as a necessary trade off in order to have a fairly functional life.
I sailed down past 10 mg and currently am at 8.5 mg and over 1/2 way to 8 mg. Wait a minute.........been feeling those old familiar muscle pains over the last week. I thought it was just a little resistance to stepping down to 8 mg and it would pass. I have my doubts now and think I better add 1 mg a day for the next few days and see what happens. If it's inflammation piling up I'm hoping the extra pred will knock it back down and then I can continue on the reduction. If not, oh well I'll just have to find a comfortable dose and put the reduction on ""hold"" for a while. With the holidays coming, it might be wise to keep the dose stable through year end. Just a thought.
It's funny how one (well, me anyway) gets going smoothly and you set this mental goal that you're aiming for. In my case I thought I had it nailed and was going to reduce smoothly down to 7.5 or 7 mg. So much for that! It's a reminder that it surely isn't smooth sailing for the majority of us when it comes to reducing. Just watch out for those uncharted reefs!

"I started on this journey last July....
I had all the preliminary tests and then saw Consultant Rheumy for the results - he was an arrogant SoB - I went armed with a wealth of questions and some thoughts of my own after his colleague mentioned it could be PMR and he questioned why I bothered to go and see him if I had all the answers! He was not impressed today when I pulled him up on his copy letter to my GP that stated the Prednisolone dosage - 15, 12.5,10mg per month and then reduce TO one mg a month, instead of BY one mg a month. Stopping Pred for 7 days made me very ill and involved the emergency services but am sort of back on track again now...he intimated I should have known I couldn't just stop them.....plus he never said I would be on them for at least a year but his letter should have spelled it out a little better by adding 'reduce by 1mg a month, i.e. to 9mg,8mg,7mg etc for those who didn't have their lateral thinking head on, - then if his secretary made a typo error, it would have been clearer...yes, he blamed his secretary but I reminded him he signed it albeit electronically....no wonder he doesn't like me much ! Ha !
His unsympathetic offerings today at my four months check up were - up the anti to 12.5mg after my blip and start the descent again or reduce completely by 1 mg every week if I want to come off them quickly...no what if's of but's, he couldn't be bothered and made an appointment for Feb with the parting shot '....if you have weaned yourself off them in that time just cancel the appointment ' !
Short and not so sweet and left me none the wiser - apart from my CRP and ESR levels have reduced significantly but my Vit D is very low, requiring a heavy dose for 6 weeks to catch up, followed by a maintenance dose but my GP was already on that.
No assistance with the weight gain - almost 2 stone heavier - no help with the insomnia or any other side effects...more or less put up and shut up or get off it....ho hum....what is a girl to do...
I so appreciate this forum for a bit of a rant....thanks for listening folks.

What is happening to our adrenals while they are being suppressed by prednisone? Are they atrophying (sp?) Are they shrinking? When I'm off pred, (perhaps 5.95 years from now) will they bounce back like nothing happened? Or, is there long term harm being done to our adrenal glands, but something we have to put up with in order to have some quality of life?
Finally, is there something we can do for our hibernating adrenals while we use chemicals to perform their job? I remember reading, somewhere, that cod liver oil strengthens the adrenal glands, but I don't recall where I saw that, so I can't give you a citation.

"I understand that new bilateral pain may arise from either PMR or prednisolone withdrawal, while tapering cautiously below 7 mg pred. And that prednisolone withdrawal pain can last a week following a small taper.
Is tapering below 7 mg pred so slow because pain typically stems from prednisolone withdrawal rather than PMR?
Is such tapering similarly slow for medical conditions other than PMR, where sufferers have also taken pred for a year or more?

What is happening to our adrenals while they are being suppressed by prednisone? Are they atrophying (sp?) Are they shrinking? When I'm off pred, (perhaps 5.95 years from now) will they bounce back like nothing happened? Or, is there long term harm being done to our adrenal glands, but something we have to put up with in order to have some quality of life?
Finally, is there something we can do for our hibernating adrenals while we use chemicals to perform their job? I remember reading, somewhere, that cod liver oil strengthens the adrenal glands, but I don't recall where I saw that, so I can't give you a citation.

"I'm wondering if we have lost a lot of people who had been on for a long time. I know I almost gave up with frustration but hung on and now I have got the hang of this forum again I am managing to work it out but I cannot get the emojis.......just a square. Perhaps that sums me up.....square. Now that gives away my age! I am missing the 'oldies' though it's good to have some new company. Perhaps they have all gone in to remission, in which case, I'd like to know how they are and any tips they may have. I know. We're all different so it won't necessary work for us all but it's good to know.
Meantime, I'm thinking of changing my name to Michelin. I am about to look out my padded black coat and hitch a ride on the Michelin tyre lorry. I could give the wee ( Scottish for small) man on the lorry a fright and do him out of a job but it'll be a wee bit cold on top of the cab now. My English cousins found our use of the word wee hilarious. We have snow gates in use and roads closed already...........unusual for October.

"In desperation I spent a couple of hours and managed to get the whole first page of notifications to be for a single long thread and pressed the mark all as read button, hoping it would be for that page only. Well, it marked ALL as read. But oddly enough the ""NEXT PAGE"" button appeared at the bottom.
This is not very useful as I know there are posts from several day ago which I haven't read, but every time I get far enough to think, maybe I didn't read this one, and go to look (so far have actually seen them all) I have to return to the top of the list again and commence scrolling down all over again.
In the good old days of not so long ago (and this is making the last rather horrible update look good) you could at least tell what you hadn't read yet because those posts all stayed at the top of your list of notifications. Others would drop down, still accessible if you wanted them, into chronological order below. In even better times before this fiasco started the 'read' and 'unread' posts were distinguished by colour so it was much more user friendly and really easy to go through and mark as read all the posts you'd just read in a particular thread. You also always could tell if you had followed a new post. Now there's no way to tell unless you go to the post .... and then have to start your endless downward scrolling all over again when you return to the list.
I think I shall have to give it up as a bad job any attempt to read the contributions from a few days ago. I'll never get there.....

"I don't want to depress this group by my longterm PMR (diagnosed 2007)- I like everyone else was keen to reduce my steroids as soon as possible after diagnosis and although i have managed to reduce to 2mgs twice ,using the dsns method I have then flared and this last three years I have flared each year and now cannot seem to get much below 9mg before trouble flares!! In desparation following a flare last Easter requiring me to to increase to 20 mgs yet again I was persuaded to go onto Methotrexate in an effort to get me off steroids. I am also in need of a hip replacement operation and have been asked to wait this year whilst the Rheumatologist investigated whether this was RA with a PMR presentation and to try and reduce my steroids prior to the operation.
I now have been on MTX plus folic acid once a week for 5 months. I have become increasingly fatigued - more then ever before during my PMR journey and am in constant pain with my hip which prevents me excersing now. It has been discovered I am now anaemic and so have been put on iron supplements alongside the multiude of pharmacologies to prevent and support other diagnoses that have developed since being on steroids. I sleep all night apart from if my hip pain wakes me or the need for the toilet but if I do any activity in the garden, go shopping , housework or look after the grandchildren then I have to sleep in the day to recover!! I am so frustrated. It is not iron deficient anaemia, my thyroid levels are fine and according to further tests it does not appear to be RA. The fatigue I now have outweighs the stiffness from PMR - I have now been advised by rheumatology to increase the Folic acid to 6 days a week and MTX as previously prescribed plus to stick at 9 mg steroids. To continue with the iron tablets and to give it 4 weeks to see any result. I am too tired to think it all through, to process it all and was wondering if any of this group has experienced any of these problems - especially with MTX .
On a more positive note whilst I have been reducing on steroids the majority of the time, as long as I have paced myself and was not undergoing a flare, then my life style has been little affected - it is only lately that I have been restricted mainly by the hip pain and more lately by this fatigue. The experience of this group is invaluable to its members. Wishing you all the best.

"I have been using this website for a little over 2 years. and I've learned a lot from this specific group. I would not be where I am today had I not had this group to help me out. there are a couple of things that really tick me off and I know I'm going to make some enemies by saying this but by the same token I feel like some people are doing this without realizing it's wrong to do.
it is not right for you to ""kidnap"" someone else's thread. what I mean by that is that there are people, some of the same people that will ask a question about themselves on another person's thread. this is not the place to do that. if you have questions you should start your own thread. it's not only impolite to interrupt somebody else's thread with your own problems and questions, and you will get so many more responses if you start your own thread. This thread should be all about the person asking the first original question/concern. it should not be interrupted with someone else's problems/questions. I recently had to unfollow my own thread because it had gotten so out of hand and it had gone off in an entirely different direction so it was no longer about me and my questions. I tried to wait it out but it was still getting responses a month out from the original question I had.
my second complaint really is not quite the same as the first thing I mentioned. I see so many people that will respond to the question posted by telling their own story . I do understand that sometimes our own story is similar to the person who started the thread and in that case I can understand wanting to touch on some details of your own story so that the author of the thread can relate it to their own problems . but that's just it, a few little details should be all . The person posting the thread is looking for help. to show true compassion and understanding I think a responder should keep their comments to 90% about the person that started the thread and only 10% about you. I am just as guilty of doing this myself. and yes, the person who started the thread probably will feel better knowing someone else is there experiencing the same thing they are but... I think we can do that without giving every vivid detail of your own story.
so having posted this I'm guessing I'll probably make some enemies or at least make a few people mad at me. And that was never my intent . I mean this in the best possible sense . I just think that we could all use some reminders of the way to talk online in these groups .
Thank you for reading this rather long post.

"when you are having a really bad day because you just feel so beat up and rotten all over (per my previous post today, im having a bad day today due to gi distress), do you ever take an extra 1/2 mg pred? Im currently on 6 mg pred and have had pmr for 2 years. some days im just beat up, stiff and sore for unknown reasons, not a flare, just pmr rearing its ugly head, i guess. no way to predict when its going to happen. i just feel rotten. not the bone crushing fatigue that i sometimes have, just rotten.
another pmr patient who has had pmr for 14 years now (and is down to 1 mg) told me from my onset that if you move one day with pmr, you wont move the next. while ive found that to be basically true, sometimes i find that i have a rotten day for no defineable reason. if any of you have those days, do you ever increase the pred or just wait for it to pass...which it invariably does...for some unknown reason. thank you,

"I have had pmr for 2 years and am on 6 mg pred. as soon as i started on the pred, i had lower gi distress--lots of rumbling and roiling but with very bad pred-induced constipation--which i still have, by the way. anyway, when i told my gp about my lower gi distress, he said it wasnt the pred, that pred affects the upper gi system, not the lower. hmmmm. in my opinion, pred affects just about everything. i figured that with all my weakened muscles, the internal ones were probably weakened as well. things did settle down when i got below 10 mg. the roiling and rumbling and cramping got better.
however, we just went on a weeks vacation where i ate fatty unhealthy food (VERY atypical for me) and my tummy is torn up. i knew better but did it anyway, thinking i would be ok. im not. very untypical for me. has anyone else had lower gi problems with either the pred or the pmr...i'd be interested to hear. thanks!

I wrote the other night for the first time in 5 years to Radman. My story is there. Been on this wonderful site that is so comforting. I am much like you Eileen. 1 year not knowing what all this pain was about, although I know you went a lot longer, anyway I also have shown normal blood tests all along. I was a total text book case though. Prednisone curing the pain. After 5 years of prednisone I am down to 7. I still have pain and fatigue but can manage it. Recently I had a blood test for cortisol level. Dr said it was low. 4. I just had it done again Monday. Will get results at my appointment. Im thinking that it would be low because of being on prednisone for 5 years. What do you think. I work and am energized with all my customers but I have times where the fatigue hits me like a brick wall. The fatigue is crazy like some one just drugged me. Crazy. Thank You

"I'm scheduled for an epidural steroid injection in my neck (C3) on 10/24 to treat neck pain/numbness I've had for over 2 yrs. I also had a cortisone injection in my hip in July. I am on 8 mg prednisone for PMR.
Reading about epidural steroid injections, I see they can suppress adrenal function and ACTH. The danger of suppression (and the degree of suppression and length) seems connected to repeated injections. I couldn't find information about how being on prednisone might affect this. I started on pred on Christmas day 2017, so it's been almost a year. Started on 10 mg, got down to 3 mg at one point, but had to go back up to 9, and now stuck at 8.
I'm kind of scared about the collective impact of pred plus hip injection and now neck injection. Does anyone have any information on this or advice?

"Hi Radman and Eileen and all you sweet dollies,
I have been on this sight for 5 years. Always too scared to post. This sight has been everything to me and I love you all..
I started feeling pain in my hips and legs walking and especially sleeping 6 years ago. When my hubby and I would go for our nightly walk my legs would hurt and especially just going up a curb, then sitting on the couch watching tv and if I would go to stand up I would be in so much pain . So stiff like i was 100 years old. I lived with that for probably a year not knowing . Thinking I was just getting old. Holding a paperback book hurt my arms so much I decided to go to my DR.
I told him I know Im getting older 55, but is this normal? He said no and ordered blood tests.
My blood test showed normal. That one auto Immune test showed high or positive sorry cant remember right now but will look later.He Sent me to a rheumatologist. Rheumatologist was great and we went slow trying to figure it out. I was reluctant to go on prednisone. i finally agreed to go on 15 mg prednisone After a week I was feeling so great. Been on the same journey as all of you. At one point decided to be off pednisone but could barely move. Went back to Rheumatologist and had to go back on prednisone to enjoy life again. Right now I am on 7 Mg. i know i should probably be on more to help with pain but I am getting by. i work on my feet 4 days a week. Im a bad ass and try to push through. lately my heels have been really aching and I remember that from the early days PMR. Does anyone else have that?
Also Eileen, i am getting my blood test again for the low cortizol level. Which I think has to do with the prednisone. It may account for my extreme fatigue some days.
Thank You to everyone on this site for your love and kindness to all of us who all of the sudden came down with this crazy PMR..

I was diagnosed with prm and giant cell 4 years ago. I have only normal blood markers so make my condition really hard to monitor. The rheumy goes my how I feel and a positive ultrasound for gca plus and 72 hour to response to prednisolone.
I haven't had any gca for two years but big problems reducing the pred dispite reducing really slow.
Within the last month which I got down to 1mg pain and stiffness was dreadful I starded to get a stabbing pain along my artery outside my ear up to the temple, not continuous but it worries me plus I have had tenderness of the scalp and thickness under the temple vain.
The problem is that I don't know if it is giant cell. I spoke to the rheumy nurse as I cannot speak or see my rheumy doctor. She relays my problem and it is all diagnosed over the phone.

i read on another forum that when you get to the lower doses, you shouldnt do split dose because you want your adrenals to learn to function without the benefit of the evening dose. (split dose wasnt making a big difference for me painwise anyway). so a couple weeks ago i stopped split dose. well! the fatigue is mind boggling, to say the least. i would say that my adrenals are definitely noticing the change from split dose to full dose.
here is my question: do i proceed with dsns to 5 1/2 mg pred or do i stay at 6 mg until the fatigue lifts, which ive read could take many months? i had planned to stay at 5 mg for several months (whenever i get there) but am unsure how to proceed now. thank you.

"Hi, have been very concerned over last weeks that I may be developing GCA. I have seen two different GPs at my surgery, the first told me I could not have GCA as inflammatory markers were within normal range in my recent blood test . Eileen kindly pointed out that doc was wrong and i went back following day. Second GP didnt really respond to my comment about blood test results ,was very pleasant and reassuring telling me I didnt present like someone with GCA whatever that means and that there was no way she was going to refer me for further test other than another blood test
I accept that i have become extremely anxious, GP probably thinks Im a neurotic nut but I believe that the symptons Ive had warrant investigation or at least an opinion from someone with specialist knowledge. So Ive decided for my own peace of mind and obviously my health and future to find an appropriate consultant, self refer and pay . QUESTION IS does anyone know of such a person in England? I live South Derbyshire but would travel . There are names on the internet obviously but if Ive learned nothing else from this forum and my own GPs over last 18months of pmr it is that the so called experts are not as expert as they should be .

"my advice to all PMR sufferers is to do a trial period of 2 weeks without wheat and see how you feel. I am convinced that it is a major factor in my own case .
just try it , avoid every type of wheat and in all its forms, no bread, no wheat based cereal , no cake, no soya sauce(yup!) , watch out for the less obvious ways that it can creep in to your diet also.
and then see if your symptoms improve
it worked spectacularly for me.

"After reading ‘abnormal’ on my blood test results I was a bit concerned about being anaemic but Eileen pointed out that this is fairly normal with our condition. Karenjanizaz gave it a name ‘anaemia of chronic disease’ (also known as anaemia of inflammation) and pointed out that turmeric is contraindicated in this condition as it interferes with the body’s iron storage. So I stopped taking it.
About three weeks ago, in preparation for my first pred reduction from 10mg -9mg I started taking half a teaspoon of Bi-carb twice a day as suggested by someone else on this site.  As my hands are very inflamed I thought that if I saw a reduction in the inflammation it would show the bi-carb was working. There is no reduction in the inflammation! I became concerned that I might be doing myself more harm than good so I  stopped taking it.
My head is in a spin with all the things I could be taking to improve my condition!!  And the choices – should it be calcium carbonate, calcium citrate or calcium phosphate.  Then the things they say you need to go with it - Vit D? probably. Magnesium? Dunno, Vit K? dunno, Boron? And so it goes on.  Don’t even get started on iron supplements!!!
I am going to eat more eggs and try to eat liver once a week which is probably better.
From now on I am only going to take things I am prescribed or recommendations that have been properly, scientifically tested.
I made my first pred reduction from 10mg to 9mg on Tuesday and so far am fine.
Have hurt my back being a bit over enthusiastic with my exercises.  I lost concentration and forgot to be careful!!

"I just marked 4 years with PMR. The diagnosis began with pain in my right hip which was X-rayed and said to be mild OA. At the moment, on 6 mg Medrol-heading to 5.5mg, without any PMR issues. I also have Osteoporis and after 3 years on Reclast, just began Tymlos. I've been having pain in my right hip which was x-rayed yesterday and found to have severe OA and avascular necrosis.

"hi folks! Well, I've just done what I've Always been afraid of doing and I'm turning to this forum to hopefully give me some quick and accurate advice!
a few hours ago, I fell back asleep (it's 12:12pm right now).
that wouldn't be a problem except.....I can't remember if I took my 15mg prednisone or not!
typically, I wouldn't have taken it til about now, but when I just went to take it....a little alarm went off.....did I already take this???
my question is, is it better to just skip today all together (and possibly suffer as the day goes on?), OR, should I take (perhaps) another dose, and how badly will this (or not) screw up my system???
I could really use some Quick advice!

"Just read something about PMR being most common among people of Scandinavian origin, and that the inclination toward PMR could have been spread by the Vikings during their excursions. I know that researchers are finding evidence that, in their active times, the Vikings had traveled further than previously thought, such as the middle east, and even northern India.
I find that interesting. It could mean that we who are afflicted with PMR carry a Viking gene. Maybe that explains the occasional urge I get to sack and pillage some small English village. (grin)

Last week I had a raft of blood tests and my VitD was very deficient and required an immediate correction of 50,000 units per week for 6 weeks. Many VitD Deficiency symptoms mimic PMR ! I Would assume this would have been investigated before putting me on such a nasty drug like Pred........ Does anyone have any knowledge or experience of this......I will be very cross if I have suffered unnecessarily on PRED, and Vit D Deficiency was the culprit for my aches and pains!
I so hope you are all still on this forum as it has been inaccessible for a while.....it will be a sad day if you all leave the sinking ship but i assume this is what the developers meant when they were trying to reduce the advertising we see......so I assume they have to pay for it somehow! Sadly i am too poor to pay for such a forum and as advice comes from individuals in a similar position I think its a liberty - so perhaps bring back the advertising......such a shame if it all goes to pot as it has been a godsend to me on more than this topic.......but perhaps we will link up on another forum!
MEANWHILE I hope someone sees this and can answer my question......

"Hello,
Could you please give me some advise?
I am 56 and diagnosed with PMR and GCA four years ago no blood markers but a ultra sound picked up the GCA with headaches. Fortunately the GCA burned out 2 years ago. I managed to get down to 7mgs and after that the pain and stiffness was back.
I came down really slow and at 2mg couldn't walk and have terrible stiffness. Unable to get an appointment with my rhuemy and the rhuemy nurses have not called back. My doctor will not increase my steroids without rhuemy consent!
So I am on 2mg and unable to function. Should I self Medicate and at what dose? Or perhaps this is steroids withdrawal and I should see it out? Also I have tender spots on my scalp is this something to be worried about? (GCA)

I had just moved so no doctor nightmare.  Luckily I had some pred and started myself on 20mg...some instant relief..more with time, but upper right arm took longest.  In the meantime i saw a number of bad docs. A Rheumy who was good.  All stress to get off the pred.  So i was doing the DSNS got from 20 to 17.5 about 2 weeks ago and the right arm started again....so back to 20mg.  I got some initial relief but not the pain keep getting stronger.  Needless to say i am scared to death, i never want to go back where I was.
It just seems odd to me with the 20 mg that it hasn't stopped the pain.
I have been diagnosed with PMR and other things ruled out with docs interviews and testing.
The Rheumy is a research doc so seeing him regularly is out.
Going to a newish general doc on friday but he seems like he has no clue.
I get more info here than I have gotten anywhere!

"Don't know if anyone has covered this yet, but there was a U of GA study funded by NIH that started to be talked about this Spring.  The scientists discovered that drinking baking soda water 2 X a day can help with inflammation.  Apparently, the baking soda turns off the inflammatory production of the pancreas and TURNS ON an ANTI-INFLAMMATORY mechanism.  
I was having great success with boron/turmeric/serrapeptase earlier this year for my PMR -- my lab results showed huge reductions in CRP and Sed Rate within one month of this regime.  Something like a 60plus reduction right out of the box.  But, even though my markers were incredibly lower, the pain/stiffness/numbness, while reduced, was still plaguing me -- not terrible and debilitating like the initial onset, but still there.  Then  -- 
I tried the baking soda.  Have done it for a month now -- results -----  AMAZING.  Am practically free from pain and stiffness.  No, not all gone but dramatic!!!!  First time in 9 months that I am practically NORMAL. 
Are there complications with the baking soda -- of course.  Are there complications with ANYTHING you do -- of course.  Is baking soda for everyone -- NO.  Don't know if you can do if on Prednisone.  I WAS NOT ON PREDNISONE.  I only took the pred for one week in order to be diagnosed with PMR but have not been on it since.  DO YOUR HOMEWORK -- INTENSELY -- and see if it is something you could try.  Just Google (or whatever) Baking Soda and Inflammation or Baking Soda and Autoimmune.
My regime -- 1/2 TEAspoon in 8 oz of water in AM and PM.  I always took away from foods and medicines.  Two hours either side.  (This can be the hard part.)  This dosage was less than some recommendations but worked for me.  May need to supplement with folic acid in connection with B-12 absorption, etc., etc.  Again, do your own research.

"Hello all,
I am a realist, and while i want to think PMR is a singular event, I believe when experienced, it is a lifetime resident, hopefully quiet and not too obnoxious. To wit:
I'm a 68 y.o. male in Florida, USA. I've had 2 significant bouts with PMR/ RS3PE, one un-diagnosed at 53, one misdiagnosed then correctly diagnosed at 64. I've written poems here about club zero and another.
I'm writing this to say that I've grown sensitive to the initial symptoms which imperceptibly pre announce the arrival of PMR misery. For me, it is bilateral Hip pain and /or bilateral osteo inflammation. I have suspected that very low dose prednisone (>4 mg/ day) can cause  suppression of the ""spiraling up"" of the full blown PMR symptoms.
Specific example: about a week ago, I had familiar bi-lateral hip pain. Waited a few days, for self confirmation, it was increasing, and then started 4 mg pred/ day. Full remission in 2 days. I will begin a slow taper after a week, and hopefully, I suppressed a flare. There is some literature which supports this approach. I has worked a few times for me.
I've had this unhappy traveling companion, PMR/RS3PE, for 15 years, and probably will be with me until I depart. I just want to be able to keep him quiet, and maybe this method will help a few of you. By the way, I can't rely blood tests to confirm, since I'm largely seronegative for PMR.
Good luck to you all, fellow travelers, Thank you for your contributions . This forum is the single most informative and helpful travel guide I've found for my journey.

"I have finally been persuaded by my rheumy to take Leflunomide. I turned it down about a year ago, as I felt the potential side effects were too high, as, apart from GCA, I also have bronchiectasis with pseudomonas.
But, when I saw her last week, she brought it up again, as I've been having problems with tapering/flares. I'd managed to get down to 7mg pred in November of last year, but my markers were up and after several months of going up, then down by 1/2mg pred, then back up again, I'm now on 12.5mg. I've got to the point where I am so tired of this constant yoyo'ing and feeling rough a lot of the time.
Another reason I was so reluctant to try Leflunomide is because I had terrible side effects with methotrexate about 2 years ago and I'm scared I'll experience similar side effects. I did mention tocilizumab to her, but she said she might have suggested it when I was on a much higher dose of pred, but not at 12.5mg.
So, I'm hoping some of you can reassure me of the side effects of Leflunomide. I'm on 20mg daily. Its only been less than a week and I know it will be several weeks before it kicks in. I know we all react differently, but it would be reassuring to hear some positive results!

"Hi Eileen, I took some mobility equipment back for a friend and there was a volunteer chap there with PMR whom I have seen before.  He said he was on a maintenance dose of 4mg after 4 years.   But he said he knew people with PMR who were off steroids within 3 months.   I said they couldn't have had PMR and he swore they had.   I didn't stay to argue with him as very self opinionated.    Have you every heard of that???
Another volunteer in Oxfam around 80 told me she had been diagnosed by her GP with PMR at some stage and she ""had got over it on her own without steroids"" looking at me in a very superior way.   All sounds very odd to me.

"I had my first visit with the rheumatologist yesterday.  I am 60 years old & recently diagnosed (9/17/18) with both PMR and GCA. Started by internist on 20 mg of prednisone- after 5 days increased to 60 mg.  Rheumatologist has very high suspicion of GCA based on symptoms and ERC & CRP results.  Concern is the biopsies will now be negative due to being on high dose of prednisone for 10 days when biopsy is scheduled. So I have two questions- 1- should this concern me? Dr intends to treat as confirmed diagnosis due to her high suspicions and 3 of 5 positive on the table of symptoms and - 2- when does the headache go away?  Considering I have been on 60 mg for 6 days now...
Also Rheumatologist is sending to ophthalmologists, for an Echocardiogram, and a bonedencity scan.  She would also try an MRI with contrast for further confirmation and look for 2nd opinions on reading as she feels USA is behind Europe in diagnostics.
Thoughts?

"This is something I didn’t connect until my 2nd bout when reviewing notes that I took.
In Feb 2015, I started experiencing jaw pain and headaches around where my glasses sat behind my ear. I went to my PCP, who ordered a brain scan for the headaches - no problems found. I had been on Simvastatin for 3 months, and my PCP then switched me to Atorvistatin - which I stopped in June of 2015. In the meantime, I went to dentist to rule out tooth problems, I went to TMJ specialist who wanted my jaw reworked for $4300. Then went to a chiropractor who resolved the jaw pain. I also lost my appetite, dropped 20 lbs, had balance problems although I was still active, vacationing etc. However the bi-lateral pain in hips, shoulders, knees a little bit started in the summer and I felt like I was wasting away, forcing my self to eat and feeling like my muscles were turning to mush.
Finally, after changing PCP doctors, I was diagnosed with PMR, started on 20mg in Sept 2015 with immediate relief of pain, and appetite returned. Just in summary, I tapered to 0 Pred by Dec 2016. Re-diagnosed because of weight loss in April 2017. Finished last dose of Pred in April 2018. SED rate immediately went back to 58 and now CRP is elevated. 
Bottom line is I just wonderered if anyone else has correlated Statins and PMR.

So I started at 20, after being miserable at 15, and soon felt better, if not perfect.  After a month I took a blood test and found my SED rate was 45, down from 52 and 64 of my last tests.

Part of my problem is in my lower back, so I can't tell which is which PMR or back.  But why would my arms hurt from a bad back?  Thanks for any info.

I've got so much pain in my shoulder that when I reached to pick up a cup just a minute ago, I almost dropped it. If I understand it correctly, 16.5 to 15 isn't really an excessive drop. My question is, (mind you my doc's on vacation), should I just try to power through and accept this is part of the process? Is this how a ""normal"" taper goes?

"I've had PMR for 2 years now.  My first rheumy moved after about 8 months and my 2nd rheumy retired in late May.  Today I had my 1st appointment with rheumy #3.  At first I thought things were looking pretty good.  He listened and said it sounded like I had a good grip on how to handle the PMR and that my reduction of prednisone seemed to be going slowly but successfully. He discussed how effective prednisone was and how the side effects varied. 
I was starting to tell him how well my reduction has been going the last months (at 9 mg, working towards 8.5 mg now) how I was finally below 10 mg without problems.  At that point he kind of cut me off and said I needed to just take pred in the evening instead of a split dose and needed to get below 7 mg quicker so the risks of side effects were less likely.  He said he was going to put me on Diflunisal 500 mg twice a day to help fight the inflammation so I'd be able to reduce the pred quicker.  He said it might be a bit expensive and I took that opportunity to say I'd check out what it'd cost me and decide if I would use it or not.  Whew - he caught me off guard.  Why does a new rheumy ALWAYS want to put you on a new prescription?  I looked up Diflunisal and it sure sounds like ibuprofen to me.  And 2 pills a day will cost me a mere $3 a day!  Forget that.  I'll be emailing him a note that I'm satisfied with my progress with just the prednisone and am going to decline to take the new prescription.  If he doesn't like it so be it.  Depending on his response I may be looking for rheumy #4.
I figure if things are going relatively smoothly right now, why mess with success?

I think they posted an article to read. Of course I cannot find that discussion now. The reason I would like to read it again  is because I have a wonderful new Doctor, but she still firmly believes that if anyone is still on Pred after 2 years, then they are just addicted to it.

"So I had PMR for four years and then reduced to 0 uses DSNS and this site, I started having problems again.
I asked GP for referral to rheumy. Bloods show normal CRP and ESR and low Vit D.
So I started on a loading dose of Vit D and felt better after two weeks. Next I had MRI of my hips and shoulders showing bursa. I have steroid injections and felt wonderful, best I had felt in years.
And then I was assaulted at work. Head injury and bruising to hand, arms and legs.
And then pain and stiffness started again.  Not really like PMR, so back to rheumy more injections but still stiffness, poor sleep etc.
Another full spine MRi as rheumy concerned. MRI showed a disc problem  - l’m 54 - so no surprises and no inflammation.
As I have got tender spots on my neck, shoulders, thoracic spine and hips, I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. Rheumy feels the trauma of the assault set of fibromyalgia.

The bottom line to all my and my doc's poor decisions was that I had to start from square one only at a higher dosage 16.5mg instead of the original 15mg! My question is, is 16.5 considered to be a high dosage of prednisone? It seems most of what I'm reading from you folks is you all seem to be under 10mg. All answers accepted! Lol

PM and I stayed at that level for about a month.  Yesterday's tests were CRP 32.3, ESR 36.  Today I took 4 mg AM (figuring a 25% increase) and will keep the PM at 0.5.  My question is when would it be meaningful to have those labs repeated?  I generally have blood drawn once a month, but I'm wondering if improvement would show up sooner.

"Hi , I have had pmr for just over 3 years. Down to 3/ 2.5mg pred for the last 4/5 months. Last month or so have noticed bad cramp in major joints, hips, shoulders, back and tum area, particularly when doing yoga and Pilates. Saw my gp yesterday about other issues but mentioned the cramps and fatigue. He thinks it could be a pmr flare and wants to increase to 10mg for a week then back down to 3 the following week. He has arranged blood tests but my bloods have not shown inflammation markers before so doubt it will now. Does it sound like a PMR flare?
Thanks

"Hey to all
Someone talked to me today about CBD Oil   Cannaidiol  Yes...a derivative of cannabis
Chronic pain
The same report studied CBD use for general chronic pain. Researchers compiled the results of multiple systematic reviews covering dozens of trials and studies. Their research concluded that there is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.
A separate study in the Journal of Experimental Medicine supports these results. This research suggests that using CBD can reduce pain and inflammation.
The researchers also found that subjects were not likely to build up a tolerance to the effects of CBD, so they would not need to increase their dose continually.
They noted that cannabinoids, such as CBD, could offer helpful new treatments for people with chronic pain.
As of what I have read so far, I am thinking of continuing to wean myself down to 7.5 , 2.5 down every two weeks. at 7.5 is when the pain comes back. Then I might try this rather than increasing my dosage again.
Anyone else heard of this?

Now have some stiffness/discomfort in morning which I can cope with and it does improve by midday. Not getting any worse. Latest blood test shows ESR 15 and CRP 20.

"Hey folks...I should say Hey ""Ladies"" as apparently PMR effects women more then men!  They say it is rare, whites more than any other race, and of course, older people. So when people ask my what it wrong with me, I merely respond that ""I am an old uncommon white woman!
Not funny tho....it took 8 months last year before someone diagnosed me with PMR...nobody else knew what was wrong!  So I have been on steroids since last November. Every time I attempt to wean myself down, it flares back up. I am soooo over this!
Despite the ""fat pad"", the thin skin, the patechial rashes are bad enough, but oh my word, my hair is a mess!  Dry, brittle, frizzy, breaking off at the ends. Saddens me greatly!  I have been wearing my hair up for the past year so the bald spots don't show. Thank heavens I started with a thick head of hair or I'd be bald!
Any suggestions folks?  I have gained 35 pounds and between that and the hair it gets rather depressing!
I did try Kerotine...but when it came in the mail the label said that if you are losing hair due to a prescription, this product will not help!

"Husband has a rash covering most of his back - but it's rathr odd. It has the appearance of something like Chickenpox i.e. widely spaced pimples - but there's no itching!
We can't work out whether it's the Glic or the Pred since he was discharged from the Assesment Unit taking both and the rash developed after a couple of weeks then spread. He was told that the Glic could cause a rash after a month or two.
Trouble is that one finds that ""a rash"" is listed as possible side effect for just about any medication.

"I have PMR since November 2015 and was slowly reducing and got to 3mg, when I started having problems with knuckle joints, pain, weakness and swelling.  About 3 weeks ago I saw Rheumi and he suggested not to reduce pred any more and also gave me some ointment for inflammation/pain. It helped a little, but did not really improve the swelling /pain much. I requested another appointment and saw him again a week ago. He thinks it is most likely RA, and that swelling is because of synovitis.  He increased the dose of pred from 3mg to 8mg and I will see him again in 3 weeks .
Inflammation and pain was gone pretty much after 2 days.  I have actually increased the dose to 9mg (6mg after midnight and 3mg in the morning) for 6 days now.  All the symptoms of RA are gone..
Now question: I would like to go back to lower dose (4-6) ASAP before my adrenals shot down again, but don't know what sort of treatment RA requires as far as dose and time. Is this going to be weeks, months or longer? Does RA stays under control on lower dose of pred?
Just for a reference, if I recall correctly, i did not have any hand problem above 4mg, and I noticed them first when I reduced from 3.5 to 3mg

When i went to see my doctor she reffered me to the hospital, and test was done, and i was told i had suspected bone cancer.
After the longest two weeks of my life i was told we think it could be something called PMR, well i can tell you i could not tell you what i felt, i just thanked God .
We all have a story to tell, and as Eileen says we do not die from PMR yes i know we have pain etc, but we can cope with this.
At the moment i am on Mtx, not for pain relieve, but RA and i am having tests done, as they have found modules on my lungs, and also my white blood cells and red cells dont look so good either, so it might be about time i came off it, i am waiting to see the doctor.
So Lynda while PMR drives us mad with all the side effects, we are alive, and i can move now, even dug my garden , and planted winter plant, but suffered next day, but what the heck i am still here, and can watch my lovely grandson grow(waited 10 years for him)

"after reading advice from Eileen and others regarding my bombing out at 4 1/2 mg. pred last summer and again this summer, I have come up with a slower tapering plan to get me over the hurdle and help my adrenals adjust to the lower doses of pred.  A little background:  started pred for PMR in September 2016; both times when I got to 4 1/2 mg. pred (using the 84 day dsns when I reached around 7)--bone crushing fatigue and stiffness and soreness set in.  Soooo...here is my plan:
-Go back to 6 mg. pred, stay for 2 months to calm things down. (I went back up to 6 mg. pred 2 days ago; the difference already is amazing.)
-using dsns, reduce to 5 1/2 mg., 84 days.
-stay at 5 1/2 mg. for 2 months.
-using dsns, reduce to 5 mg., 84 days.
-stay at 5 mg. for 6-8 months.
now I'm up to the year 2020.  Not what I had planned for myself, but what do you think?  Too slow?  Try to shorten the 2 month stopping points?  Listening to my body doesn't work too well because obviously when I tried to reduce before, I thought I was doing just that, doing well enough to reduce, but then at 4 1/2:  whammo!  I'm not a patient person when it comes to this illness, who Is?  And the side effects of pred although supposedly negligible at lower doses are taking the toll on my body.  thank you for your thoughts.

"I had a phone appointment with a GP today (just finished my first month of 15mg pred) and I asked him about enteric coated pred. He said that it's no longer prescribed; apparently research has shown that it offers no further protection to the stomach and it was a 'ruse' by the drug companies to charge more for the drug. Perhaps it's only in Scotland that it's no longer prescribed? Has anyone heard of this? 
I feel a bit confused after today's appointment! In a previous phone appointment with the same GP he tried to push the alendronic acid, omeprazole and something else (can't remember!) but I was reluctant to take any of them without looking into it further. Today he didn't try to push any of these. Why the change of heart?!  (I'm pleased, but confused!)
The good news is my pred is now down from 15mg to 12.5mg! Heading in the right direction...

"Found this interesting article that explores if some of us are more susceptible to develop chronic pain after trauma  based on our genes...Hypothesis is that too much cortisol in the system may cause chronic pain in some individuals but not others.
some key points...
""Cortisol is a critical link between trauma and chronic pain. This is because cortisol and another stress hormone called adrenaline have been shown to directly sensitize peripheral nerves – giving it the ability to signal pain in the absence of nerve injury. For this reason, it is vital for our bodies to carefully regulate cortisol levels, and to quickly and effectively resolve the stress response.
Regulating the stress hormone cortisol
Fortunately all of our bodies have natural regulators of blood cortisol levels. Typically, a protein called the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds to cortisol that has been released after stress exposure and causes cells to alter activities of the immune system and brain. But another protein called FKBP5 can also manipulate cortisol levels by binding GR and preventing it from binding cortisol.
If FKBP5 levels are high, it sequesters the GR and prevents the GR from binding and lowering blood cortisol levels. Consequently, levels of cortisol in the blood can rise and potentially cause harm by binding nerve endings and causing pain sensations. Previous studies have shown that a person’s genes can influence relative levels of these proteins.""
...""Our genetic analyses revealed that in both African-American and European-American individuals who carry at least one copy of the less common variants, FKBP5-TG or FKBP5-GG, experienced more pain than the individuals carrying only the more common FKBP5-TT variant.""

"Since this is a new topic (for me at least), I didn’t know whether to tack it onto someone else’s discussion or open a new thread.  So here I am.
It seems to me that most of the people who participate regularly in this group probably know at least as much, and probably more, about PMR than your everyday general practitioner.  For me this group has been a great source of practical knowledge.  I have studied as much as I can about the condition on the internet, and even have a copy of Zuckerman and Inglefinger’s book “Coping With Prednisone” on my bookshelf.
I will be seeing a new GP next month.  My question is:  How do I interact with this new MD without coming across as a know-it-all?  I don’t want to appear as intimidating.  I’m going there for help.
For instance, it’s a good chance that your everyday MD has not read the 2017 Mayo Clinic study that knocks over a number of sacred cows concerning PMR treatment...I have (thanks Elaine).
So, bottom line, how do I handle this first meeting?  I’m sure many of you have faced the same situation.  What is your experience?

"Hi Eileen, is it true that ibuprofen doesn't help pmr pain as I seem to think I read this on the forum.  My husband started 3 months ago with very stiff hamstrings and he carried on doing heavy digging in the garden until it became more and more painful affecting the thighs and the legs and he had to stop.  Physio exercises to stretch them made it much worse.  He rarely visits the Dr and has never had to take pills for anything so I knew the pain was bad when he agreed to go.   She suggested taking a stomach protector with ibuprofen and this actually has helped considerably.  But...pain is now in his upper arms and shoulders.  His CRP was 19 and ESR normal. Dr did offer for him to take steroids for a week to prove a point but he has so far refused as he remembers how ill I was when I started on 30mg and all my side affects. (I've told him he would probably be started on just 15mg).    Xrays of his spine and hips came back normal wear and tear for his age (78).  He refuses to go and  have more tests through a rheumy so we are stale mate.   Dr says it's fine to stay on the ibuprofen for as long as it is helping him and if his stomach stays stable.   Worst part is he can't sit in a car for more than half an hour before the pain hits him in the legs so we are stuck at home.
What is your opinion please?

"Hello from Varna, Bulgaria!
I know it's difficult to diagnose anything online, almost impossible really, but I will be happy about any feedback at all from any of you, since I don't trust the medical ""professionals"" from my country anymore.
To make a long story short, my sister's left foot is rolled inwards, it's inverted. The inversion is so bad she can't even walk. Literally she can't walk. She needs someone to support her everywhere by hand, and she doesn't go outside our home, almost never. My mother spent hundreds, even thousands for doctors, medicine, check-ups, blood tests, etc.
They're pumping my sister constantly with cortisols, various antibiotics, injections and other heavy meds because a couple of ""experts"" say so. The ""experts"" from Bulgaria officially stated ""she has an Arthritis"" which ""cannot be cured"".
She can barely go to the restroom and can't take a shower. She just became 7, but my mother don't want to let her go to school this year. My mother believes she has an Arthritis, I don't. We don't have Arthritis in the family.
From not being able to properly walk and from sitting all day, my sister became a blob. She's currently around 60 kgs of weight which makes her around 130+ lbs. She's 7! She sits all day, doesn't move at all, on her couch, and eats. Watches TV, plays on a Tablet, and that's her daily routine, in general. She have become so fat that her fingers are touching each other and she can't hold a spoon anymore. 
She's breathing only indoor air and they open up the windows in her room only once a day for 10 minutes, which I believe it's pretty damaging for any human!
Not going to school and not having normal friends (since she doesn't go outside) is slowly but surely turning her into an anti-social creep. That's the reality. 
And to top all that, yesterday she broke her toe, because she slipped. I decided to dig around, googled ""bent foot"" and I found photos of exactly how her foot looks like! The condition these photos are connected to is said to be ""an ankle sprain"". 
And also: ankle sprain / lateral ankle sprain / inversion ankle sprain.
She walks on the outside part of her foot exactly like in the photos attached below. Her foot looks 100% exactly like that on the photos.
I can't convince my mother that she's just procrastinating the inevitable. If that's a sprained ankle or a ligament problem, a surgery resolves that, right?
How do you think?
Thanks in advance!

"After 2yrs. of trying to get down from 20mgs. of Pred., being sent for a second opinion, finally getting diagnosed with GCA  and tapering down to 6mgs.+10mgs. of Leflonomide, I thought I was really doing well. I was due to drop to 5mgs. (I was tapering by 1mg. a month) but I didn't feel right, I got in touch with the Specialist Nurses and they got back to me and told me to go back up to 10mgs. as it might be the start of a flair. I could have cried, I then saw the Prof. who is treating me and was told that my CRP was up to 27 from 11 a few months before. She increased the Leflunomide to 20mgs. andtold me to carry on tapering by 1mg. a month as before. I have been really worried in case this didn't work, She reviewed me today, and to my immense surprise told me that my CRP was now down to 5. and all the results are so far normal, I can't praise her enough, she has in the short time I have seen her asked me how I felt first, rather than bombarding me with test results. I know I am not out of the woods yet, but it's the first time I have left the Hospital with a spring in my step, I think the good Rheum. are worth their weight in gold!

"Maybe be an odd question but here goes. I had to cut up a fallen tree last week which was entangled with poison oak or ivy vines.  I developed a terrible rash on arms/legs within 24 hours which has been more severe than ever before.  I have used the usual topical remedies and tried adding Benadryl tablets  but one week later still have rash in some areas and new flareup spots daily. 
Beginning to wonder if the intensity of my reaction and the fact that it hasn't subsided quicker might be due to PMR or the fact that I am already on steroids and my immune system is messed up.  I am on a low dose of 4 mg/day after 4 plus years of steroids but thought the steroids would help better.
Thanks for any feedback in advance.

"Suddenly 2 days ago lots of large blue veins appeared on my chest, one running across the left side more or less from my shoulder across my clavicle and down a bit. But lots appeared on my breasts. They were there in the evening and much less visible in the morning. Back again at night tonight although not so many or as visible. Anyone know what is going on? It was like I had been scribbled on with a thick blue pen!
PMR diagnosed July 2014. Started Prednisolone 15mg to great effect. No pain now, just the fatigue, breathlessness and denseness. Now reducing down to 11mg slowly.

"Hello,
I'm in need of some evaluation, opinions and general feedback from experienced sufferers of PMR.
I'm a 66-year old male of Scottish/Irish descent, and several years ago, I started experiencing increasingly severe bouts of stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and backsides of the upper arms (i.e., the triceps), all associated with considerable pain and restricted motion, particularly when trying to extend either of my two arms over my head.
The condition lasts throughout the day and evening, and is far worse upon rising in the morning, but the onset of severity seems to slowly begin shortly before bedtime each night. All-in-all, the condition has progressively worsened and I've visited no less than 4-5 general practicitioners (GP's), all of whom essentially refuse to diagnose (or treat) it as PMR or fibromyalgia. In other words, they absolutely will NOT prescribe prednisone or prednisolone. Instead, they have referred me to local Rheumatologists who have all had excessive waiting periods of anywhere from 10-12 months.
However, amazingly, and almost entirely by accident, I've since discovered (after taking some prescribed for our family pet), that the entire array of symptoms are virtually 100% eradicated by a daily dose of 15-20 mg of prednisone. In addition, despite their referrals to specialists, I was also able to get one or more of those general practitioners (GPs) to order-up some key blood tests. Here are the results of those tests:
Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): 29 (Ref = 12.7-20.2)
C-Reactive Protein (CRP): 24 (Ref = 0.0-3.0)
Rheumatoid Factor (RF): <10 (Ref = 0.0-14.0)
Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA): Positive/High (Ref = Negative)
Anticyclic Citrullinated Peptide (Anti-CCP): 6 (Ref = 0.0-19.0)
Blood Sugar (Glucose): 158 (Ref = 65-99)
Needless to say, without ready access to prednisone or prednisolone, I remain in a fair bit of pain, and I've been enduring it now over a protracted period of time (close to 3-years). So my question is this . . . despite being a male (apparently 4 out of 5 sufferers are female), are these collective circumstances enough to support a 'sound' diagnosis of PMR by a specialist (when and if I ever get to see one)? Or could these symptoms and circumstances still be something other than PMR?
Thank you.

"I have been going through some old discussions and I think I now know how I must deal with my problem.  I am fairly certain it is a flair of my existing back problem rather than a PMR flare.  To be honest, I think any health professional  would be hard pressed to distinguish between them unless there is a flare in my shoulders and hands, which there isn’t.
So many thanks to  Anhaga for the discussion ‘Injury and flares’, to Eileen for the very useful links in the discussion she started ‘Pacing in chronic illness’ These I will study carefully and make myself an action plan. To BettyE for her ‘PMR and muscle strain’ and to Michdonn for ‘PMR and Exercise’  I am grateful to you all.
Am I alone in this ? – One of the things that really gets me down is the embarrassment of having to tell people I am not better!

"Husband (PMR+GCA) has reduced Pred from 40mg pd to 35mg pd over the past 3 weeks . ( roughly the 10% guidelines on GP instructions).
He came home this evening complaining of backache and unilateral knee pain - wondering if it was because of reducing the pred.
Prior to the onset of PMR symptoms he'd had intermittent back and knee problems and the commencment of Pred intake removed this discomfort onsiderably.
Could one assume that these symptoms should coninue to be alleviated?
I did point out to him that, having spent the day at a country show in roughly cut grass fields, he'd been walking and standing on uneven surfaces. Then also he'd been bending to get the best angle to photograph various livestock. Starting the tractor which he'd been exhibiting involves a vigorous turn or three of the flywheel.
Not a particularly relaxing day and 10 years ago would probably not have bothered him!

"Been doing a bit of wombling round nutrition wesites etc.
A few quotes
""Vitamin K2 is mainly found in meat, egg yolk, liver, butter, hard cheese, soft cheese and natto""
(Not sure about trying Natto though - apparently somewhat smelly fermented soy beans)
""Cheese contains the powerful nutritional triad of calcium, vitamin D and vitamin K2, which together channel calcium into your bones and teeth while keeping it out of your arteries; this, combined with its omega-3 fats, make cheese a very heart-healthy food""
""Excellent cheese picks due to their high K2 levels are Edam, Gouda, and brie, but cheddar, Colby, hard goat cheese, Swiss and Gruyere are good choices as well""
Fortunately thusband (the one with PMR, GCA) is fond of cheese.

Now I'm experiencing the forementioned in a very big way! I have a couple of cavities (major dentist phobia, and I mean MAJOR!), but I'm doubtful that's the problem. Is this yet another ""weird side effect"" of pmr and shouldn't prednisone help with that? I'm tempted to take 2 more mg. but would appreciate some QUICK advise! Thanks in advance.

"I know this is a PMR group and not an osteoporosis group but I've heard a lot of people talk about this medicine in this group. As some of you may recall I had a pretty bad fall last February where I broke my left ankle in 3 places and sprained my right ankle. I have had lower back problems for 13 years but in the last couple of months I have had some severe spasms in my upper back. I have done everything under the sun to deal with them and nothing has helped. So I went to my chiropractor the other day and he wanted to get an x-ray of my upper back before he did anything. I'm really glad he suggested that because as it turns out I have a fracture in my T8 vertebrae. I'm assuming it came from my fall but I do know that it can happen if when someone has osteoporosis. I have osteopenia and that's according to a bone density test I had done in April. So my rheumatologist wants me to start alendronate right away. I want to know what everybody's feelings are about taking this medication. If I remember right I think people had some bad reactions to it. And when I read the side effects it's pretty scary. BTW I am currently on only 6 mg of Prednisone and it is controlling my PMR symtoms quite well. (Although my last blood work showed an elevated CRP) I think given the circumstances I'm probably going to have to start working on tapering off of the pie prednisone. I've been holding off because of all the pain I've been having (with the blessings of my rheumatologist surprisingly.) So please everybody tell me your experience on taking this medication.

"Koen,
Well what an interesting post you have given, makes me think more about the fact 40% can see real benefits with mtx.
Then again I am on a low dose of Pred. so as suggested by Eileen ""if and when it causes side effects, is it worth it for the sake of a few mg.""
My better half drinks a low alcoholic beer made here in Oz, Coopers Ultra Light, fermented from malt, hops and yeast, less than 0.5% alc/vol, we can purchase it in our supermarkets, they also sell the German Ultra light beers, all a very good. It would not worry me if I had to stop drinking alcohol, I am only a social drinker.
Thank you Koen1, happy to hear you have had a positive result with mtx.

"For the last week or so I have a lot of pain in my pelvic region and this morning I can barely walk.  As I have a long history of back problems, known as failed back surgery I just don’t know what sort of pain I have!!
About a month ago the back pain and PMR  were nicely under control and I was taking 10mg pred.
Under my rheumy’s instructions I started reducing the pred by 1mg on 1st August.
Stupidly I got carried away and started doing more challenging exercises, lost concentration and pulled a muscle in my back.
Over the last 2 weeks the pain has got worse. The muscle I pulled seems OK but I now have pain in my whole pelvic area and this morning could hardly walk.
I do not know if this is a PMR flare and I should increase my pred or a flare from my old problem.  The pains are not dissimilar but the back pain usually improves as the days go on this is getting worse.
I am very down this morning. The doctor doesn’t know the difference either and I don’t want to discuss it with him.
Would it be a good idea to go back to 10mg pred or even a little more and see what happens?  Would this completely mess up my pred reduction?
I just don’t know what to do for the best.
Thanks for listening and thank goodness for this forum.

It was put to me to possibly try this method to be able to get me off Prednisone.

I did some research on Methotrexate and it sounds just as frightening as Prednisone, though it was explained to me you only take a weekly dose instead of daily.
I am thinking it might be better to stay with the Devil you know than the one you don't know.
I have been down to 2mg Pred. though could not stay this low for long, am now back up to 5mg, it has taken me over 3 years to reach these  levels.

"Wise & wonderful people here - I have more questions! 
I had to go for blood tests today and now that I'm more jenned-up about PMR, blood tests, etc., I asked the nurse what my previous (first) blood test results were - fully expecting them to be for ESR & CRP. But apparently I was tested for PV (2.08mpa) and CRP (42mg). 
I have read a little about PV and can't understand why I was ever tested for this. I had none of the symptoms (or at least none of the symptoms listed on this site: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/polycythaemia/
So, my questions are: what does 42mg in the CRP test mean - are the inflammation markers extremely high, or slightly? Any ideas why I had the PV blood test? Is 2.08mpa good or bad?
Today, the nurse would only do the same 2 tests again - she wouldn't do ESR, calcium or Vit D. Apparently only the doctor can request blood tests - the patient can't.

"I've been on 15mg pred for 3 weeks now (PMR). I have an appointment for a blood test on 20th August, and a phone appointment with a GP on 21st - I assume to discuss reducing the pred. I assume the blood test will be to check for ESR and CRP levels - but what exactly are they?! I know vaguely that they measure inflammation, but that's all. 
If my inflammation markers are down, does it mean that the polymyalgia is lessening, or does it mean that the pred has reduced the inflammation? If my inflammation markers aren't down, can I still start to reduce the pred by a tiny amount? (Psychologically, it would boost me to reduce it by even 0.5mg!) I'm not getting any pain now (for a while I still had stiffness and slight pain in my hands in the mornings) so that's a good sign. 
When I had the first blood tests, I didn't think to ask the GP for detailed results - he just said my inflammation markers were up; but this time I'll be sure to ask for details.
Thank you in advance - you're all so helpful & knowledgeable here!

"I saw my regular dr yesterday and she said I simply have to get off the pred. because I am still gaining weight.  I tried for a month to eat well, and I went to the dr thinking I had lost at least a pound.  No, I had gained 9 pounds, three pounds from 300!  So yesterday and today I have relied on the hydrocortizone which he endocrinologist prescribed so I could reduce the pred.  I feel the pain when I do more than a few minutes of house chores, but do OK if I just walk easy and rest a lot.  I'm still crying when the pain gets to me, but if it doesn't get worse than this, I could do without the pred maybe.  Anybody have info on this?

"I was diagnosed with pmr last October after having symptoms for 2 months. I am a very fit and active person, my passion is hillwalking and climbing and the diagnosis was a big shock to me. However I reacted really well to a starting dose of 15mg of Pred and was able to (cautiously at first) resume my activities. Since then I have managed to decrease slowly,with no major issues, to 8mg using the wonderful dsns regime and continue to enjoy my passion. Then in July I went on holiday to the French Alps and decided to remain on 8mg whilst there as I knew I'd be more active and didn't want any problems. It all went very well, I did an activity every day, including a 17 hour overnight ascent of a big summit. No extra Pred needed. On return to the UK I started to have shoulder, neck and knee pain, which lasted for 2 weeks. I kept to 8mg and tried to carry on with my usual activities but the pain remained. Thinking this might be a flare up of symptoms I made the decision to increase the Pred to 10mg and this seems to have had a good effect. Just wondered if anyone has any ideas as to why I was ok in France but started to have problems on my return home. I'm 58 years old, work full time as a nurse and (as you have read) I am very active and train hard to enjoy my passion.

"I am new to this group and asking quite a few questions for my husband. In the end of May, he started to experience pain in his shoulders and groin. It was so uncomfortable that he couldn't sleep at all. This has lead to 5 general practice doctors visits, 2 MRIs, an X-Ray, an EMG, an orthopedic doctor visit and 2 different blood work ups. Since we are now in the end of July, his symptoms have only increased. He now has pain in his shoulders, elbows, hands, knees, and ankles. His hands are so swollen that they look like he is wearing boxing gloves!! So far, his doctors have prescribed opioids which have done little to relieve his pain. He is so miserable that he cannot sleep at all. I can see how frustrated and upset he is by not being able to handle everyday tasks. Simply taking off the toothpaste lids hurts him so badly. This morning he received results from his blood work that stated he had elevated CPR and ESR levels. We are currently trying to get into a rheumatologist, but I was wondering if any of you have any any luck with any topicals or over the counter treatments to bring any relief while we wait?

"Hi Everyone.
I’ve been reading through this site for a few weeks since my GP gave me a “possible” diagnosis of PMR. I will have my first Rhemy appointment later this week and am hoping to get some firm, or clearer idea of what is wrong. I’m a healthy 56 year old woman, usually active by swimming, strength training and walking. About 3 months ago, things changed where the normal stiffness and soreness after a good workout lasted 24/7, even if I’d skipped a few sessions!  At this point I am stiff and sore all the time and the swelling in my forearms  is incredible. They are tight and tender, and if I sit for more than 20 minutes, my calves are the same. I do still walk about 20-30 minutes each morning followed by stretching exercises in the pool. I am still doing strength training, but at a much reduced level to accommodate the pain. The stiffness seems to go away, not totally, but returns once I sit down to work. Sleeping is almost a joke since I get no more than 1 1/2 hours at at time, so I’m exhausted. Any thoughts? And thank you!

Recommended steroid therapy regime[5]
    Daily prednisolone 15 mg for three weeks.
    Then reduce to 12.5 mg for three weeks.
    Then reduce to 10 mg for four to six weeks.
    Then reduce by 1 mg every four to eight weeks or alternate day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days).
    Tailor this to the individual according to symptoms.
    Treatment is usually required for one to two years. Maintenance dose is usually 2.5-5 mg daily. Steroids may be stopped when the patient is asympt
Please note the last (in bold/my doing) two lines.  This article was written by Dr. Mary Harding, dated June 26, 2016., pre-dating the latest 2017 PMR/Pred Mayo study.  Perhaps updating these articles could diminish false hopes of remission.

"Recently been diagnosed w/pmr. Was put on prednisone (much to my dismay). Want to get off it asap. Started @15mg. 1 month ago. Unfortunately, it helped within hours. I was blown away! However, I want to stop soon so I've gone from 15 to 12.5 to 10 then to 7.5 within 1st month. That's when it seems to have gone south! Pain&stiffness all over again. Per doc, I'm back to 9mg. Am I gonna be on an eternal rollercoaster? Ughhh. I've already gained 4 lbs. NOT GOOD! I'm not even eating more. Also, I've been getting lots of headaches and am quite fatigued. I'd appreciate any advice or input anyone out there could give. Thx!

"I used a strong topical steroid Diprosone on a fragile area of skin, very stupid I know in retrospect. I only used it two days in a row, but by then I was sweating non-stop which I guess indicated it was going systemic. Now three days post my last application and today I had a sudden event, felt light-headed and I was going to pass out. My mouth dried up. Worst of all, all the skin on my body has become dry and rough-feeling. I'm so scared this is permanent.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in April this year. Started on 20mgs Prednisolone. Wonder drug took the symptoms away. Now alternating 10mgs 8.5 mgs every other day. Apart from stiff neck in morning, no symptoms.
Unfortunately I am feeling so low and my husband says I am constantly angry and snappy.
Is this just me becoming a horrible person or is it prednisolone?

"Husband saw Diabetes Specialist Nurse at health centre a week ago when he'd been on 40mg pred pd for about 6wks but she didn't issue a meter and said she would follow-up in 3weeks.
However saw GP shortly after re pred dosage (consultant had died) and she issued a meter and prescription for more strips plus instructions to reduce pred to 30mg over 4 weeks.
Have only managed meter readings for 3 days but the pre-breakfast (i.e. fasting) reading is a fair bit highr than others during day and evening.
BUT he takes his Pred at 5.30. am (wakes up for visit to loo) so thiswould be 3hours befor breakfast so is it likely that the Pred has started to raise the blood glucose levels before he's taken his Glic (after breakfast).

"Hi All, and thanks for all the wonderful insight, some gained by your pain and suffering :-(. 
My first trip to the Rhuemy got me on 800 mg of ibuprofen 3 times per day because of the diabetes and due to the fact that I was only able to see the Physicians Assistant and she would not prescribe pred because of insulin resistance. I never took that amount but used NSAID to stay sane until I was able to see the RA two weeks later. She prescribed 10 mg of pred which greatly helped, but I was still fighting the PMR symptoms, though to a lesser degree.
My sugars did spike as forecast and my most recent A1C was 8.0 (target <7.0). However much of that included high results associated with the stress of the pain and some travel. I test 9x per day and am on insulin pump therapy so I can make corrections real time. I am still a work in progress trying to get the sugar in control.
I went to really low carbs on my diet as several in the group suggested and that is helping.
I saw the RA on Wednesday. I asked for an increase in pred and--as predicted she said she would put me on  methotrexate. Thanks to my knowledge gained from this group, I said ""no"".
She increased my pred to 14 mg per day. I am now in much better shape in terms of the symptoms and able to exercise moderately. Stay tuned.

"As long as the 1mg pred pills are uncoated, it is very easy to make a quarter to help with a slow drop.  I use a pill cutter to make a half which comes out perfectly, then use a sharp knife to cut in quarters.  I do a few at once and use them for a few days to see if my body is ready to take a half drop.   If I get the PMR pain in my right wrist, I know I have to leave it for a week and then try again.   This avoids a flare I believe.

"Having been diagnosed recently I have had 4 weeks on 15mg pred; initially great improvement but then still significant morning pain esp shoulders. S/B rheumatologist who suggested to increase to 20mg for 2 weeks then reduce to 15. Spoke to him today as the 2 weeks is up, about my concern that I still have inflammatory markers as shoulders pain still bad. How much should I be expecting, ie is some pain ok or should I expect to be pain free before reducing?
Rheumy seems fixated on me having a bit of impingement in both shoulders so maybe its not PMR pain - I am a physio and know that I do not have impingement!
I also told him I had been better since taking the pred at 3am when I wake with pain, however he says this is not a good idea as interferes with body's own cycle and may give me insomnia ( I can't sleep after 3am because of pain anyway, so maybe this is irrelevant?). Advice gratefully rceived

"I'm so glad I joined this forum - it's so informative and people are so helpful! 
I was recently diagnosed with PMR and prescribed 15mg pred. I queried this at the time with the GP because I'm petite (barely 5ft and approx 45kg) he laughed and said that children from age 12 were prescribed adult dosages when it came to drugs. This was a phone consultation so he couldn't see me. 
I'm reading Kate Gilbert's book and noticed: ""a small patient weighing only 50kg would start on 10mg per day...""
What do I do? I've been taking 15mg for 12 days now. The doctor isn't phoning me again for another 3 weeks. Do I just reduce the dosage myself, say to 12.5mg? Or do I have to speak to a doctor before doing anything like that? Or do I just carry on with 15mg as prescribed?

"Hello, I really hope someone here can provide some hope or assistance for my mum. I'd appreciate it if any-one can share their own journey with auto-immune disorders and how long it can take to go into remission from GCA, as my mum is becoming rather hopeless now.
My mother was diagnosed with Giant Cell Arteritis, December 2017. She had previously suffered with Acute Pancreatitis (October 2016) and Divirticulitis (October 2015) resulting in 11"" of colon removed (no bag). She has been diabetic since October 2016 due to pancreas inflammation.
When she initially was admitted to hospital due to nearly going blind, she was diagnosed with Temporal Arteritis and started on 160 mg Prednisone, tapered off to 80 mg over two weeks, then released with instructions to reduce dosage by 20 mg every three weeks, then by ten after that. Long story short, any-thing below 20 mg and she would be unable to walk due to pain in calves. Surgery is not an option to open her arteries as they are too narrow, so doctors added Methotrexate, which did nothing to help, and she has now been prescribed Actemra injections once a week (this week will be one month of being on that medication). She is on 20 mg Methotrexate, once a week, and still taking 7.5 mg of prednisone every day.
The issue is that none of this seems to be helping her. The only medication that even touches her pain is at least 15 mg of Prednisone, but her doctors are all extremely worried about keeping her on that medication (she has been on it for eight months now). Is there any-thing else she can try to help reduce symptoms ? At the same time, her head-ache, shoulder, and neck and jaw pain are back, and she says her eye feels ""weird"" despite narrow angle laser surgery and strong medications.
The worst pain is concentrated in her calves though. She has to walk in order to bring a bit of blood-flow to her legs or is looking at amputations (she doesn't know this bit yet), but her calves hurt so much after two or three minutes of walking that she can't continue until she rests for five - ten minutes. Going from one end of the mall to the other (a walk that took her five minutes just last year) is now a 45-minute marathon. She has become extremely depressed because she can no longer exercise (was active before) and is terrified of losing her sight still (though doctors keep promising the chances of it are slim). We live in the California and have fairly good insurance through our employer (government job), so these medications are covered, but it's a fight to get them every time. Is there any point in keeping her on these though if they're not helping her at all ?
Please let me know if any-one has experienced any relief from GCA/PR/PAD taking this particular cocktail of meds, and, if so, how long it took to feel better. Thank you in advance for any response, reassurance, or advice.

"I was quite worried about this appointment as the Consultant had written to my GP telling him I would be reducing pred by 1mg per month and he was going to put me on Methotrexate.
After going through dozens of posts from people on this site I couldn't find a good reason why I should put myself through it!!
My appointment was with a nurse specialist and when I told her I was really reluntant to take methotrexate she simply said ""Fine, but we may need to bear it in mind in the future""
I do not have to go back for 3 months and my GP will issue the prescriptions for pred, so I am now confident I will be able to reduce at my own pace and I feel much better. I don't expect any problems for the first couple of months but if there are I can follow a slower reduction plan.
I did try the AA just to show I wasn't totally uncooperative but it made me so ill that after the second dose I decided 'no more.'  Haven't actually told anyone that yet!

"I am reluctant to admit that this may be a flare as I am now on 2mgs. I have a number of the symptoms I had before diagnosis.....lack of appetite, fluttery heart feelings, lightheaded, stiffness rather than pain in the hip area, very tired. I have no trouble turning over in bed so it is not the same as the early pain.The stiffness could be attributed to sitting more as I am tired. Is it possible that this could be due to withdrawal symptoms? I know I have not been resting as I ought as I lowered the dose. This is partly due to circumstances beyond my control. I am finding that I can sleep well and beyond now, as I have lowered. I also nod off in the chair fairly easily and am not in the mood to eat or cook. I am eating much smaller portions. I thought it was the hot weather that had caused the lack of appetite but this has continued despite the drop in temperature. Any thoughts or advice would be welcome.

"I've been rereading many of your posts and feel for all with this disease - oh, my!  Then I went to my doctor's online chart in which I can read my lab results and checked my SED rates for the last year.  At this time last year I had tried hard for the rheum. to cut down on pred.  My SED rate ended up 120, the highest it has ever been.  I went back onto about 20mg pred and the rate went down to 62.  Over the course of the year the rate has never been below 49, mostly in the 50s.  I am in pain all the time, cry with depression a lot, and can't do what I want.  But the dr is convinced that my PMR should be over with, as I've had it four years or more.  When she sent me to an endocrinologist, he was more up to date and put me on pred plus hydrocortizone.  But I am not any better.  20mg of pred seems like it ought to help me more.  I doubt I can get either dr to prescribe a larger dose, either.  But one time I did what I wanted and took 25mg for two days and the third day I felt so fine!  What do you all think?  Anybody in the same situation?

I checked the form he has to take in re bloods a week tomorrow and the Dr's name is that of the Cardiologist.
This man of mine isn't thick and he's not dementing (just tries to avoid doctors) and he can't remember cardiology being mentioned when he was in being assessed.
The 40mg pred is working nicely ATM - no pains on eating and neck freer than it's been for a while - he says it's much more pleasant going for a ride on the motorbike as no problems turning head to look for traffic.
He is a bit concerned at the mention of cardiologist though.

Before I was diagnosed - so before I had taken any pred - the fronts ie palms and fingers, but not the backs were very inflamed, the joints stiff and painful. 
Now they sore and things like wringing out cloths make them hurt a lot. The fingers I use for typing and operating the mouse are becoming quite raw!
I looked up carpel tunnel but I don't have any pain as such, but maybe the pred would deal with that?

"I was diagnosed over 4 years ago with PMR, with no blood markers.  It took almost a year for diagnosis because bloods were always normal.  I have been on prednisone starting at 15mg, lowering over time, and no back up to 7 mg which seems to manage most inflammation.  I tried methotrexate in the hopes of reducing prednisone further but it did not work for me. I have been having an issue with periodic face redness and inflammation since February... every 3 to 5 weeks, my face spontaneously gets hot, red, itchy and inflamed... for a period of 2-4 days.  I use a cortisone cream, aloe vera, tea tree oil... and my dermatologist believes it is a part of my autoimmune issues, not a topical allergy.  I have been keeping a food diary but I'm unable to pinpoint a food trigger.  I know that sun is one of the triggers... but 80% of my eruptions have not involved sun exposure.  It is not a typical lupus/butterfly rash - it involved my ears, sides of my neck, forehead, cheeks. 
Does anyone have any information or ideas to share?

"First some background. I am 75 years old and I initially started experiencing PMR toward the end of December, 2017 and was diagnosed in January of 2018. I was started on 15mg/day of pred but after three days I had a panic attack that caused me to immediately reduce the dose to 7.5. I'm currently at 6mg of pred after vacillating between 5 and 6mg. My doctor (an very good internist) prefers that I stay below 7.5mg--what she calls replacement value--in order to avoid as much as possible the deleterious side effects of pred. This dose does not completely relieve me of pain and stiffness in the morning but it is not terrible, and within about five hours of taking the pred first thing in the morning I can feel relief and by mid-evening I'm really not in too bad shape. So this is the pattern that I'm assuming many of you might be familiar with.
And now to my real complaint. I live alone and it has been very difficult dealing with this disease under that circumstance, especially early on in the disease process with no support. My friends have never heard of this disease and tend to treat me as if I'm the same old person I always was before the onset of this condition which, as you all know, I am not. When I tell my friends that I have muscle pain and stiffness they tend to analogize this to transitory muscle pain they have experienced and offer all kinds of well-meaning but irrelevant advice. So I guess I'm complaining here because I feel alone with this disease with no support from people who otherwise, if I had a more obvious medical condition, would be there for me. It is a tough place to be at 75 and I just hope the PMR might relent so I might experience a few more years without it before I'm dead.
(By-the-way, I very grateful to have found this support group. I'm located in the U.S. and I could not find a support group here. I live in Atlanta, Georgia and I'd love to find a face-to-face support group here. I've looked and have yet to find one.)

"It's 5 in the morning.  Things have been going pretty well all things considered.  I've learned to scale back my work to match the Pred dose and that's made a big difference.  Taking the 2nd 1/2 of my spit dose about 11 pm was a great help as well.  One sure has to pay attention though - can't get lax about things or you get a painful reminder.  Like right now.  I dozed off in the recliner about 9 last evening and hadn't set my pill alarm.  I woke up about 3:30 to that familiar pain in all the familiar places and knew right away I'd missed taking the pills.  Well, at least it doesn't hurt to type on the keyboard!
In one way it sucks to be so dependent on each dose.  But having a morning like this also reminds me what life would be without Prednisone!  I know we all gripe about Pred and want off it but it really is a miracle drug for people with PMR.  I hate to think what life would be without it.  Hopefully the Pred kicks in soon and all will be well in the world again.  Crazy huh.  Sometimes I wonder if this is how it is for a drug addict.  Not the same I'm sure, but similar.  
It seems like every 3-4 months I pull this stunt and forget to take a dose.  In a way it's not a bad thing.  You get a stiff reminder how you felt back when you didn't know what had happened to your body and life.  The ""New Normal"" isn't necessarily fun but it beats the heck out of the alternative.  Not all of us will achieve improvements in lifestyle like Michdonn but that's all right.  We're doing the best we can and not throwing in the towel.  It's a good fight and I'm thankful. 
I often shudder to think what it must have been like 50-60 years ago to have PMR before it had a name and before there was any treatment for it.  As a kid I do recall seeing a farmer who spent most of his days and nights in a chair because the ""arthritis"" was so painful and he couldn't be laying in bed either because of pain.  Wonder if I was looking at PMR that day. 
Always interesting to read all the opinions, problems and ideas here.  The information from this forum has been at least as important as anything I've learned from the doctors and rheumys.  Truthfully I'd be much worse off and pretty ignorant without this forum to refer to.  Sorry for the morning ramble.  It felt like a good way to pass some time while I wait for the meds to kick in.  Take care everyone.

Sorry if this has already been discussed elsewhere - I'm new to the forum and haven't figured out how to search  for threads!

"Diagnosed with PMR and started taking Prednisone in April of 2017. Started at 15 mg and decreased gradually and stopped taking it June 27. On July 6, I started having diarrhea, stomach cramps, chills, nausea and complete loss of appetite. Talked to a triage nurse today who says it sounds like a viral thing and I should start feeling better in a day or two. I cannot remember the last time I had a virus and I'm 81 years old. Could it possibly be Prednisone withdrawal?

"I said I would post an update when I had my blood test results to see if turmeric was keeping the cholesterol down.
Serum Cholesterol is 5.8. Down from the 7 the hospital result showed 2 years ago. ( I am not at all convinced that the hospital test was accurate.  When the doctor first ordered the test he forgot to ask for the cholesterol to be measured, he remembered when I went back 2 days later, but said I didn't need another blood test they would use what they had.  A result of 7 was quite a shock to me!!
5.8 is not quite the 3.5 reading doctors seem to be aiming at - who puts the up to this??!!
But in the range of normal and I will keep taking the turmeric.  I cannot take statins anyway.
I think the jury is still out on the Turmeric for cholesterol as this reading is similar to those I have had in the past.
The HDL cholesterol is 2.3 but I don't know what this means!
Hope this is helpful to some of you.
All the best

"In the last 3.5 years I've been on Prednisone for PMR, been diagnosed with cilliac disease, (blood work was very high with positive results), fibromyalgia, tried Lyrica but couldn't tolerate it) had two hips replaced and Dr says they are not healing because of the Prednisone.. still using a walker.. I walk like I have MS or Parkinson's.. my husband died and my cat that I loved so much died while I was in the hospital.. I'm on blood pressure medication, viibryd, Vicodin, inhalers because I have COPD from smoking.. CPAP machine.. oxygen was 79% on overnight test, I'm morbidly obese because I simply eat too much, I take Lexapro for sleep and the shaking spells, oh yes a pill for diabetes and stomach pills for my 3 ulcers.. I'm an absolute mess and I feel sick 90% of the time I'm awake.. I'm starting to think the medication I'm taking is making me feel worse.. I'm at a loss what to tell my Dr.. I think 3.5 years is enough time to be sick.. I know PMR is a long road but I'm getting worn out and feel like giving up.. I saw my rheumatologist 2 weeks ago and he said stay on 10mg Prednisone (what I've taken for over a year now) and come back in six months.. I think my Dr has given up on me.. my appointments have always been 2 months.. I'm sorry this is so long but I don't have anyone to talk to about how I feel.. I'm 66 and feel like I'm getting older than my age very quickly..skin problems and dark circles under eyes and I walk like I'm 90 plus and feel like bees stinging me....I know no one can fix me but I sure do appreciate this forum to be able to vent.. have a great day everyone..

"Hi everyone,
I’m recovering from a 3 point pelvic stress partly brought on by my own denial and driveness. I had stable osteopenia for at least 10 years which I kept at bay with weight  bearing exercise, diet  and Cal-Mag, D3, and Omega Fatty Acids. I was dx with PMR almost 3 years ago, had a flare after tapering to 0 last year, and I’m now at 7.5 mg and healing quite well, if slowly. So I had my first BMD test in 5 years and it came back with a dx of osteoporosis. I’ll actually get the exact number when I see my GP this week. 
I have 2 questions.
First, my rheumatologist immediately prescribed Risedronate — a weekly dose. I’ve looked it up and I really don’t want to go there. I’d like to continue using diet and exercise. For example I’d like to add K2 to my supplements. So my question is: what would my esteemed fellow travellers on the PMR trail suggest as a diet/supplement/ exercise regimen for a 67 year old woman with PMR and osteoporosis?
Second question: as my stress fractures heal, my mobility is severely constrained. I’m sedentary for all intents and purposes for at least another 6-8 weeks. The K2 makes me worry about clots. Any suggestions?
Thanks for all your wonderful insights and experiential wisdom. This platform is the hive mind in action!

I am seeing the gp this morning on another issue, and I know already that I have had a recall for blood tests..not for pmr as those are satisfactory, despite my knock, but for diabetes.
?This will be the third lot of bloods for diabetes in six weeks and am trying hard to ensure sugar levels are down. I cannot do any more exercise as I walk 3 miles in morning, 2 in afternoon and swim half a mile three times a week...albeit slowly, but I am 62!!!. I am also trying to watch my sugar intake as I really don't want to be diagnosed diabetic and it is in family..mother, brother, aunt, uncle plus 2 cousins. Blood tests are a pain...the last time, a week ago, they tried 7 times to get blood, calling the gp who tried twice, despite my drinking of loads of fluids etc etc.....
?Just having a rant, please excuse me!!! Is there a link between steroids and diabetes...???

"From this forum, I have gotten the impression that when reducing prednisone, I should be aware when the PMR pain starts to return, and when that happens, I should increase pred to a level where I don't have PMR pain, and then try reducing again, perhaps slower or perhaps after some time has passed.
My rheumatologist, in contrast, believes the goal when reducing pred should be to keep pain at a level where I ""can function.""  I've had chronic pain (Myofascial Pain Syndrome and herniated discs) for 30 years, and PMR for about 6 months. So I have learned to ""function"" at high levels of pain.  I could function before I started on pred, so if that's the goal, I don't know why she put me on it in the first place.  Clearly, I would like a life with less pain, which is why I'm on the pred.  I'm not aiming just to be able to ""function"" but to reduce my pain and have a better life.  
So I'd love to know whether I'm interpreting what I've read on this group correctly or not--that I should follow the procedure I described in the first paragraph of this post, rather than just continuing to reduce as my pain returns, so long as I can still ""function.""
Thanks.

So far doing not too badly but have developed annoying and sore ulcers. They do go away eventually but at the moment have a nasty one on the roof of my mouth.

"I was first diagnosed with PMR a little over 6 yrs ago. My initial symptoms were atypical. Although I had extreme fatigue, what brought me to the Dr. was horrible pain in my forearms. Shortly after I had jaw pain. After tons of tests, including a temporal artery biopsy (negative), I was told I had PMR. I was extremely anemic and had lost almost 20 pounds. I was seen by a Rheumatologist and put on prednisone. My treat lasted just 13 months.
Fast forward, over the last couple of months I have been experiencing fatigue and calf pain/ache. I muddled through it as I had been under the stress of losing my father after 5 yrs of caring for him, and dealing with the family trust he set up and his estate. However, calf pain/ache was wearing me down and I had begun to have hip pain that manifested after sitting. None of this even rung a bell with me as being PMR.
At any rate, I went to the doctor last week and he has run a battery of blood tests, and a doppler on my calfs.  Most of the blood tests are back and they rule out Lupus, Lyme, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Anemia. However, my C-Reactive Protein and Sedimentation Rate is over the normal parameters. The CRP is 3x the normal level, my sed rate is only 7 mm over the normal range. I may have lost a few pounds but that is about it.
The Dr. is leaning towards a new PMR flare but hasn't made a diagnosis or treatment plan. I don't have another appointment with him until the 10th of April. 
Now that I've bored you to tears, I'll get to my questions. Have any of you had atypical PMR symptoms? Been diagnosed with PMR without anemia, or a significant weight loss?  Or had a relapse with different symptoms from your initial experience?
I never thought I would actually look forward to taking a steroid, but I just can't stand the fatigue and aches and pains any longer.
I'm at my wits end...... thank God I have a husband that is more than kind and is holding up my end of things here at home.

"I started on 10 mg in December 2017 when first diagnosed,  My rheumatologist is very conservative and does not want to increase too much to avoid the terrible side effects of the Prednisone.  At the end of January The aching and fatigue was getting worse so he upped my dose to 15mg.  In February I was back to 10 mg feeling okay.  Now in April I am down to 6 mg, feeling pretty ok - odd aches in my fingers and feet in the evenings but generally ok.  Is it normal to be able to reduce this low this quickly?

"Im a 58 female and have been battling PMR for 18 months now with not a lot of success. I started on 20mg prednisone but had to double that to 40mg to get relief. My Rheumatologist then started me on Methotrexate but as prednisone reduced inflammation went back up. She then changed this to Azathioprine which made me vomit. Then we changed to Leflunomide and this worked really well and I managed to get down to 6mg prednisone and inflammation was suppressed. Then....after routine blood test they discovered my liver decided to pack it in and I had to stop Leflunomide immediately. That was 4 months ago and as this drug has slowly left the system the inflammation has gone up slowly each month and the stiffness some days is unbearable. I have gone upto 10mg prednisone and the Rheumy wants me to try mycophenolate but am really concerned that this is drug no, 4 and each one has come with a new set of problems.  A recent eye test has shown early signs of cataracts bought on by long term prednisone use.  On really bad days I also take 200mg Celebrex which is not ideal but has few side effects.  Am I a freak?

"Dear PMR sufferers
I am a 48 year old male who recently recovered from PMR ( unusually young and wrong gender, yes I know! ) and I came back into this site just to give a personal perspective to those still suffering . Many readers are often recently diagnosed and looking for answers or hope, it’s not often that a “survivor” comes back to report that there is life after PMR, so here I am.
Firstly,I’m not a doctor, I’m an engineer so don’t attach any more weight to my views than you would do to any other non medical expert, feel free to assume I may be the village idiot and NEVER act on my views without discussing with your doctor. Right, now that that’s out of the way let me tell you I know what it’s like to have PMR, first the mysterious shoulder pain rolling over in bed, then the worry and confusion  , gradually increasing stiffness , can’t tie my shoe laces , feel irritable and exhausted , overwhelmed , visit GP, referred to rheumatologist , rounds of blood tests ....terror that it’s alll sorts of worse things, then finally the diagnosis by elimination it’s PMR ,ok now we can do something, ,then the magical effect of steroids, often overnight, amazing effect, WOW I go from half dead to feeling perfect in 12 hours ...hurray I’m cured ? , no not yet,then maybe a degree of depression that this is not an overnight fix or worries about side effects of “pred”., osteoporosis , mood swings , weight gain, acne,hamster face ... I’ve had it all and come out the other side, it took me exactly 36 months but I followed the rheumatologist’s regime and had a few false dawns along the way  where I had to up the dose again but I got there in the end , it’s been 9 months now that I’ve been off the pred, the pain is gone, there is some residual stiffness in the morning or after exercise but it goes away midday or after a hot shower . Life has returned to normal or as close as it can be, I still take the calcium/vitD because I did lose some bone density to the steroids but it was a moderate price to pay for shaking off the monster.
so what have I learned? Here’s a few thoughts. PMR is an autoimmune condition so the things that affected me may not be relevant to you but I still want to mention them in case they help others . Firstly I have learned without any doubt that certain foods aggravate this condition , this is especially true when you are coming out the other end of treatment and are on low doses of pred where it’s easy to get a relapse. The immune system has broadly two response mechanisms to external attacks, those being TH1 and TH2,autoimmune disease responses seems to  occur when one of these 2 responses overreacts or becomes “stuck” on high alert , perhaps triggered by a previous virus or viral illness ,in particular a lot of people anecdotally have developed PMR after having had Epstein Barr Virus ( Also called glandular fever or mono nucleosis or “.mono” ) I’m one of those , Some doctors poo-poo this but there are too many of us for it to be random. However probably/possibly other things can bring it on as well, including being run down or stressed combined with a viral illness. Anyway, however you got it doesn’t matter you can’t change history and may never know, work with what you know today , you have PMR and you need to fight and suppress it until it decides to leave you .Personally I believe that I was what’s called TH1 dominant . My TH1 immune response was over reacting causing inflammation. Rheumatologists will rightly tell you it’s IMMENSELY more complicated than this but this is just a layman’s explanation. Now back to the foods issues . I can tell you that I tried and did EVERYTHING while I had PMR and I only came to one truth. Certain foods INCREASE certain immune responses and sort of suppress others , so if for example you are TH1 low and TH2 high then green tea may make you feel wonderfully better, however if like me you are TH1 high, green tea will make you feel dreadful , like your skin is crawling. In my case five things made me feel awful and caused all the pain to come back when I was on low doses of pred and coming out the other end of this illness, and they still trigger pain even now that I’m off the pred nine months, and this is why I mention them( and to any doctors or rheumatologists reading , please consider trying this with your PMR and also your arthritis / RA patients , you may be surprised at the effect it has on them, many of your older patients are probably glugging tea or coffee like it’s going out of fashion , so persuade them to go without for a week only and see what happens ).
The five items that caused me severe problems are as follows:
1) green tea( my skin crawled)
2) black(regular) tea( pain within 20 mins)
3) coffee, (pain within 20 min,including decaf and instant)
4) wheat( bread ,pizza , white flour etc, pain in my back and rib cage joints within about 2-4 hours and lasting for a day)
5) red wine(possibly also whiskey/bourbon) , muscle / joint pain next day .
So do yourself a favor , take all of these out of your diet for a week or two , then reintroduce them one at a time until you notice pain or you feel like crap , if you note this response give that item up forever.dont bother fighting it, just walk away from it. 
I know how hard it is to give up tea and coffee , the comforting pep up and a nice little beverage to sip with friends etc but they are just not worth it if they are triggering your body to scream “argh! I’m being poisoned”, so suck it up and learn to like hot chocolate or ginger infusions and get on with your life, if wheat gets you then just adapt to the multitude of wheat free products out there, you’ve never been better served, if red wine hurts learn to love white...if none of the above affect you then consider what else you eat ,it may be different for you ,be vigilant , listen to your body ,make a food diary if necessary , be extremely wary of all stimulants, they possibly trigger immune responses, take note, adapt and move on, take hot baths, take more holidays , minimize stress and be kinder to yourself , Good luck  to you all and remember ... like those visiting relatives and bad smells ... it goes away eventually ...

"I have been diagnosed with PMR now for ten months and was doing ok with my taper from 25 mg to 6 mg when my fatigue worsened and my joints hurt more just as I was suppose to go to 5 mg.
It was a mg a month taper since 10 mg.
I told my Rheumatologist that I wanted to go back to 8 and she didn’t want to have me do that since my inflammatory markers 3 weeks ago were normal and it risks dependency.
She told me to hang in there and if I didn’t feel better she would repeat the markers and possibly send me to the endocrinologist for steroid dependency testing  or add other meds .
My question is . If I’ve had a relatively fast taper why wouldn’t this just be that I don’t have enough Pred on board? I actually remember feeling better at 8 or nine mgs.
Seems to me that it would take longer to shut down the adrenal glands since others have been on higher doses with more drawn out tapers and not mentioned this in posts?
I have gone back to 8 mg on my own the last two days and not better yet.

"Dear Eileen   You have been kind enough to advise me in the past, for which I have been most grateful, My present difficulty is trying to understand recent blood test results. This will be my sixth year of struggling with PMR and currently I take just 4mg of pred each day. When I rang for a recent blood test result, which included a FBC and an CRP/ESR the message that had been left for me was 'all normal, no action',  However, when sitting with a GP a few months ago, and after saying that I was still experiencing PMR symptoms, particularly the aches and pains, and particularly now in the fingers of both hands and also along my arms, but also the usual pain in legs and buttocks. This GP commented, ""You do not have PMR, your 76 years of age, you will get pain"". However, yesterday,when I pressed for more detail of my blood ESR reading, I was told that it was 26. The last time I had a ESR test, about 18 months ago, the reading was 12.    My dilemma is trying to decide whether or not to try to come down from the 4 as I can manage at that level, I am not free of pain or stiffness, but, I can live with it. The  GP I mentioned tried to tell me to start reducing by 1mg each month. Saying, somewhat aggressively, ""I want you off steroids"". I have in the past always followed your slow method and that has been successful as I have been on much higher does. I have to say though, that another GP at the same practice took a different view, and agreed for me to stay at my current level. I live in Wales where there does not seem to be any specialists with PMR experience. I wonder if you would not mind me asking you what you would advise?

"Hi every one , following on from my last post 12 days ago regarding my foot pain I saw an advanced physiotherapist today , he told me that it is arthritis and he thinks that the steroids were masking it, I eventually got down to zero the beginning of this month fingers crossed so far ok , anyway as I have had problems in the past with heartburn whilst taking naproxen he thinks injections in the joints will work best for me so is referring me for those and also to a podiatrist to see if they can help . 
Keep strong everyone 
best best wishes to you all Molly

"Im hoping someone on here can help me , I’ve had pmr for almost 3 years now and have successfully reduced pred to almost zero using slow method , since September I have had a pain in my left foot which is causing me to limp , at first this was felt on top of foot where toes joined foot and first dr said metatarsalgia and gave me ibuprofen gel to try , she told me to go see a particular GP in practice if no better, the gel did nothing so saw the other Dr who organised X-ray to check for stress fracture this was clear , another GP organised ultra sound which showed some thickening between middle toes which he said indicated some arthritis , the GP said I was a mystery as he didn’t think this was causing the pain as this has now moved from side of foot from big toe to across the top to sometimes on ball of foot where it feels I’m walking on something soft . He organised bloods to rule out RA when I rang for results I was told no further action required and liver was stable I asked if there was any inflammation shown up and was told no . I can barely walk far and don’t know what to do as this is really only in one foot it can’t be PMR . 
Any advice please im desperate

"I was diagnosed PMR in Nov. 2016, and was put on 20mg, Prednisone which relieved my symptoms within a day.  Since then I reduced to 15mg, then 10mg, (and a short stint of 7.5mg which left me in pain - Rheumy's suggestion to get off the Pred more quickly... duh, nope), so I informed my GP and went back up to 10mg in Feb, '17, where I have been since. I'm still achy all the time, with bouts of random pain, roaming from shoulder to shoulder, upper arm muscles, occasionally hands, but rarely.
Just prior to the diagnosis, in early Oct, I had my annual physical, flu shot, EKG, blood work...  By the third week of the month, I was feeling achy.  Flu shots always bring on a response with me, sometimes I even have a low-grade fever.  But now that I'm 65, my Dr. suggests I get the current vaccine (killed virus strains).  Some years I took the shot, some years not.
So I didn't really think much of being achy.  Except the ache didn't go away.  My shoulders and arms, upper chest, ribs, were all getting more and more painful, to the point I was trying to stretch out my arms in the doorway, spreading them out in the doorway and leaning into the stretch... I had to stop that!  So incredibly painful...
Next stop was my GP.  We discussed what could be causing the painful muscles, and by this time, tendons and joints, too.  She gave me some low dose hydrocodone (acetaminophen with codeine) and had me come back in a few days.  The HC helped a little but pain was getting worse.  By time I saw her again, I had read every article I could find on shoulder pain, coming up with PMR.  So I suggested this... she was so enthused that I would take it upon myself to advocate for myself, and do some research!!!  She said she'd check it out.  She had me stay for another round of blood tests.  When she came back she fully agreed on my research, saying she thought I was correct!  (Yay!)  Adding to the blood tests was the SED rate.  Here's were it gets weird.
My SED rate was 2.0.  In the normal range for this test (< or = 30 mm/h).  So I was sent to a Rheumy in Feb '17.  This Dr. said I fall into a more rare category, called Atypical PMR.  SED rates are, for me, not indicative of the usual PMR test results... but I exhibit all the symptoms.
I just would like an opinion, as to whether I should get the flu shot this year or not.  With an auto-immune disease, I wasn't sure.  My Dr. decided to hold off.  I'll also be inquiring of my Rheumy in Dec.  I guess this begs a question, too, where my symptoms flared about a week to 10 days after last year's flu shot... could the vaccine be responsible for my PMR?
Does anyone have experience with this?  Thank you in advance!

"A very strange thing happened to me last evening which was quite frightening.  At 9pm I was watching the tv when suddenly the picture blurred slightly and there were like bright white hoola hoops to the left, right and in the middle of the picture.  I got up to go into the kitchen and it still persisted and I felt strangely disorientated.  However, after about 20 minutes, it all disappeared and sight came back to normal.  I was in bed later on reading my book without a problem.
Today I felt perfectly ok and drove 40 miles for lunch with my son and back and to observe a private pilates class on machines.   Felt absolutely ok.
Should I go and see the GP as can't help feeling she won't have a clue about this. It made me feel a bit panicky inside.
Has anyone else had something similar?
I am on 8mg for the last 4 weeks quite successfully and I don't have pain and I am fairly active.   Grateful for any comments please.

"A week or so ago I went down from 20mg to 17.5 because I didn't have 1m tablets to reduce correctly.  So as the week passed I'm feeling more pain in my sides above my hips and feeling wiped out with arms so sore.  Now I've got the 1mg tablets, so I thought I'd start at 18mg high to 17mg low.  So that will give me a week of 18mg.  Do you think that will work or should I go all the way up to 20 again and down to 19.  My dr is so anxious for me to reduce that she warned me she wouldn't prescribe pred anymore if I didn't reduce it.  She doesn't know what this pain is like.  I'm hoping it is the withdrawal you speak of going down a bit that is hurting me.  I've been on a high dose for so long, I'm ashamed.  Not to mention very fat and all the other side effects.

"Hi Everyone
I have now been on Prednisone for about 7 weeks starting at 20 megs, which did not relieve all off my pain so Doc  increased dose to 30 megs.in which completely levelled my pain to zero. When Pred.got increased the Doc. said to take 15 megs. in morning  7:30  and 15 megs. at night  7:30. Did this for about four weeks,back to the the Doc. and he said to reduce by 5 megs. Which I did , 10 in morn. 15 at night, also to my surprise worked well with no noticeable change felt really good still. 
  Back to the Doc.with CRP blood work tested at .4 my high was at 31 when I was first diagnosed with PMR  Doc suggests to drop 2.5 megs. in about a weeks time. 
  Did so on Feb. 6  12.5 mg. in morn. 10 at night , once again seems to be working just fine. 
  My question to everyone is that reading this blog it seems most people seem to take their dose of Preds all at once. I was just wondering if anyone else does this spit dosage system. 
   Also from reading this blog which I find most helpful and informative it seems my reduction schedule has been quite quick, having been diagnosed in early December started Preds. Dec. 15  at the 30 mg dose and now at 22.5.

"Hi all,
Have managed to reduce from 50mg (GCA and PMR) to 8mg, Unfortunately I have had my first Prolia injection 8.2.18 for severe osteoporosis and after about 10 days started to get the old shoulder\hip pain and sore arms and leg, etc, However the side effects of Prolia can be the same as PMR symptoms so in order to work out whether I wa now having pred withdrawals, PMR/GCA flare from going too low, on new drug side effects, I incresaed pred to 15 mg two days ago with very little relief. Can I now go straight back to my original 8mg after two days on 15 or should I give it a bit longer on 15 then reduce slower e.g.1mg a month. . PS: I’ve been using the DSNS method to get to 8mg and have been on 8 for about 5 weeks as I wasnt game to drop till I worked out what was causing the relapse...which I suspect is Prolia.

"Since being diagnosed with PMR Sept, 2014, I've tried to follow an anti-inflammatory diet as closely as possible. One of the things I've incorporated in my diet & take as a supplement is Turmeric. That word happened to catch my eye as I scanned our newspaper this morning and saw it mentioned in a medical help column. I read the question and answer and learned something I didn't know about Turmeric not being a good choice for people who take blood thinners. I thought I would share this with you as I've noticed many people on this forum mention that they are on Coumadin or warfarin. Here's the text I read:
Blood thinner users must avoid turmeric 
Q. I have a lot of arthritic pain, so when you mentioned turmeric for joint pain, I thought I would try it. In three days, my nose was bleeding. I take the anticoagulant, Coumadin, so I was concerned. My prothrombin time was sky-high.
I had to go off the blood thinner for five days to get back to normal. You should warn your readers about this interaction. Having your blood too thin can be extremely dangerous. 
A. Thank you for the reminder that anyone on warfarin (Coumadin) or other anticoagulants should steer clear of turmeric or curcumin.
Although this spice has anti-inflammatory properties, it also can magnify the effect of these anti-clotting medications.
Prothrombin time is a measure of how long it takes blood to clot.
This interaction has not been well studied and is not found in the official prescribing information for warfarin. Nevertheless, you are not the first person to report a serious bleeding problem with this combination.

"I have been diagnosed with PMR an CGA since May 2017.  Last week I lowered prednisone from 16mg to 15mg and experience two flares two nights apart.  Previously 3 days before the first flare I was in ER for 24 hours with dehydration and very low blood pressure (50/42).  Only my 15 mg of prednisone was administered at that time and seems the staff were more concerned with the possibilty of heart difficulties or underlying inflammation and not the PMR or CGA.  I was  released with BP 120/65. two nights later had first of flare which I didn't recognize and went to ER again.  Again they focused on heart problems and never mentioned CGA nor PMR until the last words of ER doctor which were I am going to schedule stress test for you what with all that's been going on...
Went home and visited my NP on Thursday two days after the last flare and told to raise to 40mg and maintain it until inflammatory markers are steady and low again.  Fine, but the level of pred must not be high enough to remove the pain.....NP said we want you pain free....so I raised it to 50mg on SAturday and take 50mg today as well.  The night wasn't easy and had discomfort across chest mostly right side in into shoulder blade again right side.  Morning came and I took 50mg again and was 2 hours before the pain comfort lowered to 2 from 8.  So what do I do now until MOnday when I can talk with NP again and get her advice...raise it again?  Worried about the GCA of course (Ophthalmologist appointment 4 days ago says no optic nerve problem no increase in cataracts)  Who knows what to do and hate the pain of course.  Hate raising pred again, but living with that excruciating pain is beyond me  Thank you for listening

"Morning all,
Friday I was told by my GP following blood tests that I could have PMR, was handed a prescription  for Prednisolone with a link to a website and told to come back in two weeks. You may notice the lack of any other information given to me. My mobility has gone down hill in the last 8 weeks the mornings are worse so much pain, and unable to turn in bed like my muscles have lost their strength.
I was given anti inflammatory tablets but I still cried with pain and frustration this morning.
I have read lots since Friday and I guess I am in for the long haul with PMR. Normally I am a very active and flexible 62 year old, currently working full time, now my 85 year old Mother in law moves better than me. Really not keen on these steroids and 20mg seems a lot, but I will stick with it for two weeks.
I would be keen to hear about any dietary advice, particular exercise and has anyone tried acupuncture?
So far I have not had to take any tablets and hate taking them now.
My respect to those of you who have suffered with this for so long, I really admire your resilience to keep going.
I would be grateful for any advice.

i didn’t even mention the knees to the doctor.  Advil was working 
The head  symptoms got me to the Doctor in July 2016 where a CT,  brain MRI , Lyme tests , sed rate , crp were normal among other things . They said I was normal but maybe it was all in my head!
I had lost weight
it wasn’t until March 2017 that while skiing my rt shoulder started to hurt.
Went orthopedist where my MRI of shoulder showed wear and tear .She sent me to PT .  
During PT April  2016   , My other shoulder started to ache , my whole body ached  . Advil didn’t work 
May 25 2017 i was hit very hard by the PMR. It was like a brick . The fatigue and fogginess was stifling , the back of my knees felt achy,,shoulders ached 
This time sed rate , crp. were elevated  , Lyme was neg . My primary put me on Doxycyline for a month , I stayed on it for 6 weeks . He said he didn’t know what was wrong.
I went to a neurologist who diagnosed PMR but though I improved on Pred 15 mg  50 % by day 2 he abandoned the diagnosis  because my improvement wasn’t dramatic enough . I pressed for 20mg for two more day’s but didn’t improve enough .
i had MRI s of my brain  and entire spinal cord over a months time , all we’re normal including EMG and Nerve stim studies.
By now I couldn’t get out of bed in the am , shoulders were extremely painful in am especially , hips as well
i went to the Rheumatologist when my right wrist swelled -diagnosed PMR. She placed me on Pred 20mg and I’m down  to 6 mg now.
My fatigue , fogginess continues . Presently I have shoulder  ,hip ,hand and a little knee pain 
My joint’s hurt a little more as I reduce the Pred but I’m still able to bike up to 20miles w/o much pain,I  The whole time my brain is fatigued and when done I don’t do much.
The rheumatologist is concerned that I may have something else  because a people don’t bike 20 mile with PMR?

"I am 76 yrs old,and was initially diagnosed with PMR in November 2016,prescribed 15 mg Prednisolone daily by the rheumatologist with no effect at all,followed by a horribly painful and crippling reaction to my first dose of Allendronic Acid.This was changed to daily Risedronate and the Pred was rapidly increased to 30 mg ,it was assumed that I was suffering from a severe bout of PMR.
This had a stabilizing effect,and after a while I started to reduce the Prednisolone weekly then monthly,untill last September when I dropped from 7 to 6 mg.This resulted in a huge flare up..I put myself up to 7 without any effect,my GP put it up again to 7and a half,again with no benefit.
Not wanting to increase the dose and my dependence on steroids even more, in intense discomfort I consulted a nutrionist last November.As PMR is an inflammatory condition,she advised a low Histimine diet,and gave me a list of foods to avoid.
She studied my typical weeks menu and pointed out immediately that the mixed berries I had every evening were high in Histimine.I dropped them the same evening,which had an effect the following morning,no intense foot pain after getting out of bed..and generally far more comfortable.
I started the diet within a  couple of days after stocking up with food,which I devised from ‘ things to avoid’ and have been pretty much pain free ever since. She also advised on supplements which I take daily,and suggested Epsom salt baths every other evening,followed by 400 mg  Magnesium tabs to give me a more comfortable night..Bliss! 
I cautiously reduced from 71/2 to 7mg in December,and last week reduced by half a mg again to 61/2 with no ill effects.Although I am very active,and don’t reduce my daily chores of dog walking,and looking after chickens and garden etc,I give myself an easy week when reducing and really focus on managing myself at this time.
i am writing this because this diet has had such a positive and beneficial effect on my PMR and I wanted to share it in case it might help other sufferers.It certainly wasn’t the main focus but an added bonus and surprise is that I have also lost a couple of stone in weight which I had put on  with the steroids,and my moonlike face has returned to normal.
I found pain a far great motivator at sticking to the diet.On the weight front I had tried to lose the weight last summer with no success at all..so it has been quite a surprise to find that it has been so easy and unexpected!
 I do hope this might help others.

"I have a very good rheumatologist. I won't go on about all the way she's good but she is very pleasant and is a very intelligent doctor with a very good memory. But I saw her yesterday for my 3-month visit and she is wanting me to start tapering faster than I am. She is concerned (and rightly so) that my broken ankle broke in 3 places because of my consumption of prednisone. I understand why she wants me to reduce but I'm at 12 mg and I am starting to go down to 11.5 mg using the dead slow method. But the way I have it setup is on reducing by only .5 mg rather than a 1 mg. So she wants me to drop to 11 mg right away and continue to drop by 1 mg as fast as possible. My concern is that 11 mg has been my magic number all along. Every time I try to taper down I to anything below 11 and I start having pain. That's just so very frustrating for me and this couldn't come at a worse time. But I've changed my schedule and today I started at 11 mg and I will do that all week and next week. Then I'm not sure what the schedule is from there. I am using a taper schedule from the website that I found out about here on Patient.

I have now been referred to rheumatologist and been  booked for a mri scan for my right shoulder, even though I have always said my pain is in both shoulders and my hips/legs after researching polymyalgia seemed to be the closest self diagnosed, I recently went to see my GP and when I mentioned could I have polymyalgia he completely discarded me and said I have been tested and I don’t it. I have been living a nightmare for so long in constant pain has anyone had any cases of someone my age having this condition or any other suggestions on what could possibly be wrong with me. 
Thank you

"Hi Guys,
I found this forum through internet. Seems lot of information very useful for confused folks like me. I have some symptoms last 3+ mo: I went to this place for accupuncture and therapist pressed on my temple for few mins. Since then I have pain in my both temples. The pain is intermittent and feel worse when I am moving my head/neck/mouth to speak up. The pain goes away when I go to bed or when I relax my head by supporting it. Sometimes I feel pain from back of ear to top of my eye brow along hairline and sometimes it is from top of temple to eyebrow. Since the pain lasted for such a long time I went to my GP. He thinks that probably physical trauma might have brought underlying condition. I have normal CBC with little low WBC. I am going to have ESR/Cprotein test next week. Based your experience, do you guys see this is as TA? I don't have any other sensory/vision symptomps except head pain.  Thank you all for your help and hope to get response soon.

"So, here I am happily tootling along, finally diagnosed after 2+ years with GCA, sent for a second opinion, down from 20mgs. of Pred. last August, to 9mgs. now. I was put on Leflunomide in Nov.17 and as normal. have to have my bp taken at my GPs every 2wks. and blood tests at the Hospital the same. My bp has always been higher when visiting Drs. the same with Hospitals. My GP. advised me to get a bp monitor which I duly did. Since the Leflunomide, my bp has increased. I also take 25mgs of Losartan, and 5mgs. of Bisoprolol. My bp Sunday at home was 137/70. bp at Drs. Mon. 160/77. I told the Dr I took Leflunomide and she said she wasn't aware of that one, she has increased the Losartan to 50mgs. a day. I was also told I was pre-diabetic last year and sent to Pharmacy to be tested as my blood sugar test was 44, just short of being Diabetic. On having the test, the number was down to 35, so all was o.k. I am now back to 44 again and back on the merry-go-round, I feel much better than I did, less fatigued, and apart from numb feet and having a dew-drop permanently at the end of my nose, was on cloud nine compared to how I was seven months ago. I maybe should add that my Drs. appointment was set against a background of taxi taking the wrong way, accident and lorry overturned on roads to Drs. and running into Surgery amid a rainstorm with Husband following unable to put umbrella up with about 30 seconds to spare, I shall never count my chickens again with this disease!

I was prescribed methotrextate but had too many side effects.  Now they have prescribed Imuran and I am afraid to take it as it has very similar side effects to the Methotrextate (have only just got my hair back), I am in Australia, have there been any new drugs being used overseas that are helping that I can research?

"Hi Forum friends,
Some eight months ago, I posted a message about my query over my leg pain being  a new Sciatica pain or PMR flare. Just to recap, I was diagnosed with PMR 4 1/2 years ago.  I had about 3 flares during that time, each episode was related to my incorrect reduction and lack of understanding of the PMR process.  Presently I am still suffering from sciatica left leg pain, which makes sitting painful and uncomfortable.  Sometime the leg pain is so similar to PMR pain which made me very confused whether I am having Sciatica pain or PMR pain.  I am on 7.5mg having reduced it from 10mg with the DSNS method since November.  I have all along what i regard as 'bearable pain' that I could live with.  But recently, about a week ago, after a long haul flight back from holiday, I have severe pain on my shoulder  (across my shoulder) and on one side my upper arm.   I have not had pain on my upper arm before, so I am not sure whether this is related to PMR .  
I thought it might have been due to my carrying a small back pack, but after resting for a few nights, the pain is still there.  Despite taking Naproxen or Co-codymaol, i still got this pain across my shoulder !!   I dont have pain on my pelvic area, the left leg pain could still be my Sciatica pain.
My question is,is this a flare up of my PMR ?   should I increase my Pred? and by how much.     thank you for your advice.

"I got a present of a massage from my spouse.  I finally got around to using it 4 weeks ago.  At that time I was on 10mg of pred and needed more.  I had 3-4 days a week that by 4 pm [my symptoms are worse as the day goes on]  I was holding on to walls to walk or using a cane or walker.  After the massage [therapist was a 26 year neuro muscular massage therapist] I experienced 80% pain relief.  I asked my friends with PMR if they used massage.  OF COURSE< EVERY WEEK!  Well, why didn't you TELL me?  Ha!  But now I am 4 weeks prednisone FREE.  I have pain, yes, but I can get by with 805 of it GONE!  My massage therapist has had several PMR patients.  It is ONLY in PMR does she see such dramatic improvement.  Not in fibromyalgia, Osteo arthritis, or Rheumatoid Arthritis.  They get relief sometime but not this MAGICAL relief. 
Best of LUCK!  Choose a Licensed, experienced massage therapist.  I have her work on shoulders, hips, back, neck, feet and hands in that order.  That's where the pain is worse for me.  
Best to all.

"Since November of 2017 I have had a full on change in my general health. The first symptoms was a intense pain and burning sensation from my hip bone and groin area and the inability to use the toilet to do a poo.I booked an appointment at my gp and told him about the extreme pains I was having and he was saying it could be stress related. I also had blood work done and that can back clear. Since my first symptoms I have felt like there are just new things happening to my body. I have sore and puffy armpit, unusual heart pains, tender ribs, pain below left rib, extremely painful pelvic pain and intense pressure on my anus. It somehow feels like all of these pains are happening on my left side only, even the anal pain feels like my left glute and on the left side of my anus. I have had an ultrasound which has come back all clear and now I’m going to organise a chest and hip X-ray and possibly a bowel screening or colonoscopy
Symptoms from top
- left armpit ache 
- pain in left ribs and underneath 
- pain in left hip and groin area
- pressure on anus 
- ridiculous amounts of gas after eating and loud bowel movements
- extremely painful pelvic pain ( feels like insides being torn about apart)
-tight hip abductors 
I have to add aswell, the use of marijuana seems to increase all symptoms by at least 20 times to which I had to quit smoking it because it genuine felt like I was going to die after smoking it. When smoking, the pain would start at my armpit and feel very achy, then radiate down to below my ribs, then to my groin, and finally my anus where it would feel like my glutes were Made out of concrete. 
As I’m typing this I am laying down and just feel a sensation all over my left oblique and my anus is constantly contracting and being stiff .

"Hi to all. Sorry if this is long winded,
 I was diagnosed with PMR/GCA last May and commenced on 50mg pred, a biopsy 6 weeks later returned a negative result, but sed and CRP were very high initially (I had eleventy seven symptoms of both conditions,)  so thankfully my drs didn’t  take chances. All has been going well with tapering, have been using the DSNS method since 11mg, now down to 8mg. Have had the odd pred side effect like all of us, some worse than others, but have managed to motor along quite well considering. One recent setback was being diagnosed with severe osteoporosis with a T score of -4 and had my first Prolia  injection 8th February. For the first few weeks I had no side effects that I was aware of. 
I’m a little apprehensive about asking, but could GCA be returning on this low a dose of pred (8mg), or is what I’m now experiencing more likely to be  Prolia side effects?
I  have developed a mild to moderate permananent tenderness in my left temple, at the biopsy site, if I massage it I can actually make it worse,  and a very slight discomfort in my right. When I raise my eyebrows it also hurts on the temple site, - where I had the biopsy is worse than the other side. It doesn’t go away, although I wouldn’t call it a headache as such, certainly not like the original GCA headache- more like a very tender , sore temple.  I don’t have scalp pain this time,only temple pain,  I do have a tender jaw, and also have a return of the aches and pains, tiredness, muscle pain and sore shoulders/hips. My eyesight has been getting worse since the beginning anyway, always blurry, despite new glasses, My appetite is waning again, occasional hot flushes that pass, and at times my head feels like it is rolling into oblivion when I lay down...but that’s only now and then. I’m aware that with Prolia, you can develop more aches and pains and soreness and tiredness etc...so I’m not sure whether what I’m now experiencing is Prolia side effects,( so,just get used to it girl), reducing too low on pred to control my symtpms( although my recent blood test was perfect); adrenal function trying to kick in; or something else? The side effects from Prolia, if you get them, are very similar to the symptoms of PMR, though it is this temple pain that concerns me, the rest I can deal with.  Even though it doesn’t stop me yet, it is not pleasent and I fear the only way to tell if is GCA is to,increase the pred to see if it goes away. 
If that is the case, and given  I’m on 8mg now, what dosage should I increase to, for how long, and then how quickly should I reduce again? I’ve read that one can increase quite considerable for no longer than two weeks, then drop back to the dose you were on...is that right? (I did go from 11mg to 35mg for two days, then back to 11mg to cover a tooth extraction just prior to Prolia without any issues).
I’d rather ask here first and get everyone’s valued opinion before I contact my rheumy again, as I’ve found that  he can be a bit  “text book”.  On saying that he is  also very open to me going in pre-armed with info and suggestions and then he guides me. Being in Australia, he had never heard of the DSNS method but was happy for me to reduce whichever way I liked, and has been more than happy with my progress to date. My next appointment with him is in 4 weeks, but not sure I should wait that long with this temple pain, in case it is GCA returning.

"Hi I am just new to the forum. I am not sure if I have PMR or not. A bit of history. I developed severe muscle pain in neck, shoulders and hips in 2013 with an ESR of 35. The pain and stiffness was so severe I was bed bound for most of the time and moving was difficult. I was 52 at the time. My GP said it could not be PMR because I was too young. I then saw rheumatologist who said the same, I was too young. My GP then gave me a diagnosis of Chronic fatigue syndrome instead. Any way gradually over the years the pain got better on its own but I was severely disabled for years. Then only recently the pain suddenly returned in my hips and pelvic girdle leaving me unable to move around. My GP still doesn't think it is PMR, I am 56 now.

But I'm not doing well, am now into a second course of antibiotics and a further week of 30mg prednisone but still cannot shake off this infection and resolve my wheezing. Due to fly out on a month's trip on Wednesday (Asia cruise and China land tour) and am anxious as I'm feeling so rough.

"the oddest thing--I'm using dsns method, almost at the 5 1/2 mg. stopping point for 30 days, and I started the split dose a few days ago which seems to be helping with some of the stiffness and pain and fatigue.  But:  suddenly I'm struck with constipation which hasn't been a problem for me except at the higher doses and even then, it isn't as bad as it is now.  
The only other changes in my daily routine are the switch to a different gluten free bread (I'm gluten intolerant--they came out with a new gluten free that replaces the kind I was eating) and a change in my eye drops for corneal edema. (Yes, I do suspect that eye drops can cause constipation).
Here is my question:  is the constipation most likely just part of the pmr journey...the new gluten free bread...or the eye drops?  One would think that as I get lower on the pred, constipation would ease up, which it certainly did.
 I got pmr in sept. 2017 and am tapering down on the pred.  This Constipation came out of seemingly nowhere.  I eat 25-30 grams of fiber religiously every day and haven't had a problem until the past few days.  Thanks!

"First, let me say how easy it is to reduce prednisone using Actemra instead of methotrexate. I have reduced from 20 mg to 10 in three weeks without fatigue or pain.  Previously, using methotrexate  and the dead slow method, it took me 6 months to reduce from 20 mg to 10. I was bumped back up from 10 to 20 because of possible GCA. My doctor wanted me to increase to 60 mg, but I just couldn't do it given the fact that it took me 6 months to get to 10 mg.  
The drawbacks are that it's very expensive.  My primary insurance covers most of it, but it has a $750. monthly co-pay, which fortunately my secondary insurance covers. And secondly, it is a shot.  Originally, I thought this was going to be awful, but it's so easy and it doesn't hurt a bit.  I do not like needles, but doing it myself gives me a sense of control which is actually quite affirming.  The first one is the scariest, after that it's a breeze.
I know that reducing from 10 mg to 0 is going to be more difficult, but I'll keep you posted.

"I have recently been diagnosed with Polymyalgia Rheumatica, February 5, 2018. I had never heard of this autoimmune disorder before I started researching my symptoms on my own.
So thankful I came across this forum.
Even though my blood work ups didn’t show abnormal results my GP agreed to try Prednisone based on my symptoms. I had lost complete mobility in my right arm/shoulder (GP was sugesting I might have frozen shoulder). Pain in my other shoulder with limited mobility. Hips, buttocks, pelvic on both sides had pain and were extremely sore and weak.  Difficult to get out of bed, pull up the covers, get out of chair/sofa, put dishes in cubbards, get dressed, etc.  
Started 15 mg and upped to 20 mg a week later after having immediate relief but still a small amount of pain. Have been on 20 mg for two weeks now and feeling like I have my life back again.
Have an appt with a Rheumatologist but not until May 23rd!!  So it looks like my GP and I will have to manage my tapering off of Prednisone. I have learned from this very informative site that you should always taper off very slowly but when should I start?  Should I stay on 20 mg until I’ve been on that dose for about 4 to 6 weeks and then ask GP to start tapering me off at about 1 mg per month?  I’m feeling like I probably know more than she does at this point but don’t want to risk my health.

"Approximately 7 years ago I was diagnosed with PR.  After a little more than 2 years on prednisone, under the care of a Rheumatologist and after very slow tapering, I was able to completely discontinue its use.  Because I have a number of other health problems, like so many of you, if I experienced soreness or pain from time to time, I just chalked it up to my age (62 yrs. at that time) and health issues (scoliosis, arthritis, mild spina bifida, etc.).  My rheumy passed me back to my GP for followup care. 
Within the last year and a half, I gradually began to have very sore hands (particularly in the fleshy part between my thumb and first finger.  My GP insisted that it was just arthritis but slowly this area when used frequently for hand crafts, etc. would change color and become quite blueish black in color and would sting and burn. Gradually, the veins became enlarged even up my arms to some extent.  I also have more veins showing up on my face running from my hairline towards my temple (in one case) and bulging out quite noticeably.  During this time, I also experienced pain in my groin as I tried to get in and out of my car so much in fact that I had to limit my errands if it meant too many stops (ins and outs of the vehicle).
All this time, I was suspicious of PR returning but didn't want to face it and without any concrete evidence to go on, I began to think that the doctor wondered if I was just paranoid or letting my fear take over rather than base this on any real grounds.  They even did an ultra sound on my arms from my shoulders to my hands without success. 
Approx. 2 weeks ago, I realized that I had tenderness and soreness in one temple and having been told in the past that this could be serious if not attended to almost immediately, I went to the clinic that evening and was put on 50 mg of prednisone, sent for blood work and a biopsy was ordered for both temples within a week.  I was relieved when the biopsy results came back negative only to discover from this site and that of the Mayo Clinic that this is not a guarantee.  Often results are negative when in fact a person could still be positive for GCA.  While things seem to have settled down a bit, I see my GP tomorrow and will suggest a referral back to my rheumatologist to see what she thinks.  Because there are still so many questions out there about this condition I, like so many of you, lack confidence in our professionals.  There seems to be so much more available knowledge about Fibromyalgia than about PR.
I guess I am venting a bit but also reaching out to any of you who can shed more light on this issue.  First off, have any of you received negative results back from the biopsies only to discover later that you are positive and secondly, when tested, is your blood work void of any sedimentation?  I am also experiencing jaw soreness when chewing but on the opposite side of my face from where the temple was tender.
I live in Canada and like most countries it is getting more and more difficult to find or change family doctors.  Fortunately, I was able to convince my husband's doctor to take me on as a patient and he listens tentatively to me but really doesn't know where to refer me other than back to my original rheumy. 
One more point which I find interesting is the fact that while the surgeon was working on my biopsies, I asked him how many results came back negative.  He said that in the Ottawa area (Canada's capital) his particular hospital does between 85 and 90% of all GCA biopsies and of those, only about 15% come back positive which I find rather puzzling.  When I inquired further, he said that it was rather tricky finding the right spot to test or, in other words, the exact area from which to remove a piece of the artery.  As I mentioned earlier, he did not operate right at the temple area but up higher closer to my hairline.  This may have been a precautionary measure (avoiding too close proximity to the eye) but are there any of you out there that have information or views on this?
Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.  BTW I am still on 50 mg of prednisone and my last dose is tomorrow so I will be anxious to hear what my GP has to say.  This means that I have been on this high dose for 20 days. I realize that this is not long enough to take control of the situation but I hope that i can at least reduce a little.  Keep up the good work everyone.  Your knowledge and sharing of such is a tremendous help and provides encouragement for all of us.

All Tuesday, my neck and thighs were very stiff whereas hips and shoulders just felt heavy.  I had indistinct pain from neck to knees.  I took the missed prednisolone dose on top of my Tuesday morning dose and, by Wednesday, pain and stiffness were fast evaporating.

I went to a doctor one day about another problem and she asked me why I were so stooped and limping. She prescribed me with 20mg of prednisone and for the first time in many years I had NO pain. It has taken a long time to get to where I am now. 3mg. I couldn't believe I could get down to this dose. I do not understand the condition at all. I do not feel any pain but I went for a massage one day and all my pain was still there. It took me weeks to get over it. Does the Predisone just mask the pain but you still have underlying prolems?

"Have been on pred for 4-5 years now, only managing to be completely ' off' for 3 months after two years of reducing. I am currently on 6-5mg per day but yesterday had a bit of an argument with an escaping, driverless, freelander and got knocked hard. I have bruised ribs, leg etc where I got very briefly in between said car and a gate, but today seem very stiff with pains in other places as well! Can a 'hard knock' like this take longer to heal than it would if you didn't have pmr.....?? I'm concerned that this will put me back a bit..and hang around a while before I get back to my usual daily routine.

"On February 6th as I'm sure you all know I broke my left ankle and sprained my right ankle. I had decided after that that I would not try to taper anymore until I was healed up. At that time I thought I had eight weeks but I was way off base. The orthopedic surgeon just informed me today that he wants me to stay off it for 10 weeks starting today. And I've already been at this for 3 weeks. So my question is do you think I'd be okay to begin tapering or should I stay at where I am until I'm all healed? BTW I am at 12 mg right now. And I was using the dead slow almost stop method. (I think that's what it's called).

"I am currently on 15 mg of pred which I take in two doses of 7.5 mg, one at 1 am and one with breakfast at approx 6:30 am. With a split dose I can keep my symptoms at a minimum, which I cannot do with one dose. After one month of pred a blood test taken at 9:30 am shows ESR of 14 and CRP of 8. That looks good, but I still have about 20% symptoms at night and in the early morning.
The blood test was taken around the time when the pred level in my blood would be at or near its peak, so the question is, what is the diurnal variation of ESR and CRP, and what time would be the ideal time to measure it?
This relates, of course, to the criteria for remission and thus for tapering. If you go by the symptoms alone, what would be the criteria for remission when you consider the 24-hour variation of symptoms? You might have close to zero symptoms in the middle of the day, but say up to 30% of the original symptoms at some time at night. Would that qualify as remission?
The PMR Activity Score appears pretty useless to me, as most items are hard to estimate with any degree of accuracy, and the CRP value may very well vary over a 24-hour period, so that it could be inaccurate as well.
I suspect that many of you have come up with your own criteria for a ""successful"" remission. If you would share them with us it could be very helpful in preventing too much trial and error.

"I went into menopause in August, and about a month later started feeling new types of pain--pain in my hands when I tried to open bottles, pain in my biceps when I tried to pull a banana off a bunch, pain in my hips when I stood after sitting for an extended period.  I read the book FLYING UP THE STAIRS:  WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MENOPAUSAL ARTHRITIS TO BREAK FREE, and it seemed to describe many of my symptoms.  The timing of the pain seemed to clearly indicate to me that it was caused by menopause.  My rheumatologist, though, said they don't acknowledge ""menopausal arthritis"" as a condition, and she diagnosed me with Polymyalgia Rheumatica, saying it just happened to arise in my case shortly after menopause.  She put me on prednisone.  I'm just wondering if there are other people in this group like me, and if so, have you found any effective treatment for menopausal arthritis?  I really don't feel I have the right diagnosis.  Thanks.

"New to this but glad to have found the forum.
I'm 79 (m) and about 5 weeks ago started what appear to be classic symptoms: painful shoulders, weak arms (couldn't pull the duvet over when in bed), pains in thighs when driving for more than 30 minutes. A GP in France ordered a blood test (results a bit odd but nothing drastic); he put me on a general antibiotic with high Ibuprofen. There was no improvement.
Moved to Germany (pains now much worse) 3 weeks ago and saw a GP, who prescribed  cortisone treatment, starting at 60mg for 5 days but now decreased to 10mg (half tab) and I'm on the final week. I must say that the cortisone kicked in with a couple of days and I'm feeling 100%. Another 3 days of 10mg to go, but what then?
The optimist in me is saying, ""This whole thing was just a blip and you're going to be fine."" My present thinking is - see what happens when I stop: will it have been a blip? Is this possible? As the song goes: ""I'm a dreamer, aren't we all?""

"In a previous discussion here, I speculated on whether continuing on a really low dose of Prednisone (as opposed to stopping completely) may have some protective effect re. preventing a recurrence of PMR. . . As far as I know there is no evidence to support this but maybe????
After 4 and a half years on Pred. and reducing very carefully and slowly, I decided to stop my 0.25mg. on alternative days and I felt confident to finally say goodbye  to it altogether in Jan.  Then followed a really savage Aussie flu' which took a few weeks to get over and left me pretty shattered but am now fine. However, just 2 weeks ago those familiar upper- arm aches started, just mild, but a cause for re-thinking . . . Could there be a link with the 'flu?
Can anyone advise me here? Should I wait and see if it gets worse OR should I start back on Pred. even at low dose? I'm not being precious about taking Pred. and I'm sure many of you would just love to be on a low dose, but my difficulty is that I also suffer from OP and Pred. is really not good for the bones. Would be grateful for any suggestions. Thanks.

"As many of you know, I've broken my left ankle, sprained my right ankle and bruised my rib cage on my left side when I fell getting out of my car (just call me grace) I have lots of impressive bruising too. I've also caught a chest cold, I've had diarrhea for a week and developed a rash on my back while I was staying at the rehab facility. So I'm one big mess.
So my question is how should I dose my prednisone? In the hospital I was suppose to get 12 mg but found out on day 3 they were only giving me 5 mg! So now that I'm home and deciding my own dosage should I stick to 12 mg, or bump it up because of the stress I'm in? I know not to try reducing right now and I've not been experiencing and extra pain so 12 mg is still good.

"Diagnosed January 2016 after living on Ibuprofen for the previous year.  Stopped Ibuprofen and began having a life again on 15 mgs Prednisone.  Have been on 6 mgs for over a year.  Attempted reduction to 5 mgs in ½ increments a few times unsuccessfully the slow way.  
Last year I had a knee replacement in April. On the second day of recovery, a blood thinner caused unknown ulcers to bleed.  I am reluctantly taking Omeprazole–Ramitidiine gave me hives.   The knee is healing well and I recently walked into town for the first time in three years with my little dog remembering where all the treat stores were after all that time.  
I had a painful hip previous to PMR which an MRI diagnosed as bursitis in 2014.  Have had steroid shots a couple of times within the  last two years.  Hip was very painful on the blood test day,  January 2018.  As the days went by, hip got better but have to use cane because of pain.  My theory was hip pain caused SED rate rise but GP Dr. said that would not affect blood test.
Since I admitted overall stiffness in the morning, Dr. recommended upping pred dosage and/or a steroid shot to the hip, or seeing a Rheumi. I can’t/won’t travel hundreds of miles to see a specialist.  Since a previous PT session involving hip exercises and electrical nodes to the hip did not solve the problem he ordered PT for core exercises which I accepted.
My choice now comes down to upping the pred, getting a steroid shot to the hip, and/or wait and see for another week or so for PT.  I would appreciate comments.

"Hi all. I've had PMR for about 3 years now and have been reducing the preds in an up and down fashion and am currently on 2mg, my GP has allowed me to manage it myself to a large degree offering advice when asked. Like a lot of older men, I'm 68, I suffer with arthritis.
I'm now getting very achey to the point of being painful in my shoulders, thighs. and fingers. I know the fingers may not be PMR but when I was diagnosed I had trouble there and it went when I started preds.
How do I tell if it's PMR or arthritis. I thought that if I were to take 10mg of Pred and it cleared up that would suggest PMR ( when I was diagnosed 15mg had an effect within 5 hours). if it had no effect it would suggest that it wasn't. My real question is...if the second senario was to be the case suggesting it wasnt PMR could I drop straight back to 2mg or will I have to start the reduction again?, It's a pity that my GP ( or GP's in general) don't do a question and answere web site, it will take about 10 days to get an appointment.

"I think I'm cursed. I have so many diseases and conditions several of which cause pain and none of which will kill me. So yesterday at around noon I had something horrible happen to me. I was stepping out of my car and I put my left foot down and I slipped on the gravel as I was falling. I tried to catch myself with my right foot then down I went hitting the ground on my left side. The results are three broken bones in my left ankle, a sprained right ankle and bruised ribs on my left side. I just had surgery on my left ankle this morning. And since I can't walk or utilize either foot I can't get out of bed so I have to use a bedpan which really sucks. I am also at the mercy of anyone and everyone to get things for me or pick things up that I drop, all of that. The doctor who performed the surgery this morning came in to talk to me a little while ago. He told me that I would probably be in the hospital for a few days and then most likely will have to go to a rehab facility since I can't walk. I am dreading that so much all I want to do is go home. I know this isn't PMR realated but I guess I wanted to share my doom and gloom feelings tonight. Thank you for reading this.

I entered a new practice randomly chosen and made an appt.
I had that today and the GP is so informed with PMR, she has ordered the scan and CRP tests.

"For years on and off I've struggled with a plant based diet that eliminates animal fat, oil, and as much sugar as possible.  I've fallen off of it more than I've been on it, but I have stayed on it for nearly a year at a time.  Why?  Because such a diet can halt and even reverse the progress of heart disease.  See dean ornish, Caldwell esselstynn and others who have peer reviewed studies.  The science is strong, but for someone who is used to a diet worse than most westerners its a real challenge.
While I've been struggling with PMR for the last 20 months my diet and weight has suffered.  Its hard enough just getting through a day let alone  spending hours preparing various vegetarian dishes...sooo...I've had a bad diet, and increased weight.
Nevertheless, using DSNS I'm down to 5mg a day.  However, I was starting to get increased pain, feeling very sluggish and just before I was hoping to start on 4.5mg.  Feeling sore and depressed, I also realized my diet was doing myself no good, and maybe getting back on it would help me feel better in general.
So, I went back on a very low fat (10% total calories) all vegetarian diet.   Meaning no animal products, no oil, very low sugar, and no dairy.  All the good things happen that always do, clearer head, higher energy level, but here is the kicker...
My PMR pain levels went down down down in just a few days!  Suddenly I could help around the house and get some work done!  I'm going to wait 5 more days, and if this continues I'm going to start DSNS to 4.5mg.
High levels of fat and animal protein cause arterial inflamation.  Perhaps there is some sort of connection?  Sugar levels are also dropping because I've cut out all sugar treats and virtually all processed foods, which in the US always contain lots of fat, sugar, or my favorite:  lots of fat AND sugar.  Sugar appears to be either directly or indirectly atherogenic.
I'm not a doctor, and I don't even play one on TV, but my reduction in pain in a short period is profound.  My Wife would tell you that she can't believe the difference.
This is something you can try.  I recommend Dr Caldwell Esselstyn's work, ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease"".  Its nothing to do with PMR, but the diet within seems to have related benefits.
I'll update this discussion in another week or so.  Will I continue to feel better, or will my fortunes reverse?  Turn the page...

"Hi everyone, i have posted a few months ago, and am still having the frustration of being in continuous pain and feeling ill..my background is that i have been having joint pains and squeezing type pains,then feeling ok one minute, and the next feeling like i am going to get a really bad cold and am feeling really tired and generally unwell, and have a temperature. this was (after 25 years of been told i was just picking viruses up) diagnosed as fibromyalgia.  i got the diagnosis and then just carried on as before, managing the daily pain with nortriptaline.  i then had incidental finding of 'high signal foci in white matter' after i had a ct scan to try and find out why i was going deaf in one ear.  no conclusion was found and i was offered a hearing aid.
fast forward 18 months to February 17, when i had severe stabbing pain on the top left of my head above the temple which lasted most of the night (i have suffered with typical migraines about 6 times a year) so i took a couple of sumatriptan.  nothing seemed to shift it,.  the day after i started getting a throbbing type pain above my left temple, which then led to a numb/bruised/pulsing feeling, when i lie on my left side it feels bruised and like there is something in it,i was quickly referred to a neurologist, who organised and mri scan, he said there was no change from the ct scan regards the findings. i asked him what the high signal foci in white matter, meant,  he just said anyone over 50 would have these findings of changes. and said i had a prolonged migraine, this is nearly a year ago, i have a been tried on about 5 different medications, nothing took it off. it is there 24 7, i only have to gently touch my face and it is tender.  as i go above the temple it hurts even more,and will start throbbing more.  this is then occasionally followed by a tingling from front to back, my left ear has pain inside it, the same throbbing feeling has now been happening for about two months on the right side.  i am sat here now, with the throbbing above the left and right temple.  the neurologist now wants me to go to pain management as he is still saying it is a prolonged migraine.  i am so upset and frustrated.  the tingling in my head is happening more, and more and more i am feeling tired and 'ill' with the same squeezing pains i have always had, but a wierd severe squeezing has been happening in my arm pit for a couple of months.  i have contacted a group of doctors who can help with diagnosis, but obviously a lot of people contact them. so it isnt guaranteed they will look at my case.  i am going back to gp to ask for a second opinion and am hoping they will send me to either a different neurologist or a rheumatologist, i have been in so much pain over christmas.  i felt so ill the other night i went to the out of hours gp who said after hearing all my symptoms, that i had a virus, iam in tears with frustration, and have pain in the left and right side of my head.  
i have been to a and e a couple of times over the last eight months, one doctor mentioned temporal arteritis straight away, but as my bloods were ok he said luckily it isnt that and sent me home.
i am so frustrated.  could you have temporal arteritis for nearly a year and not be diagnosed.
happy new year to everyone that has to come onto a discussion.  sadly i dont have the money to go private.  X

"Hi all, last time I posted I was waiting for an appointment with a Rheumatologist and had been on 15mg prednisilone for about 3 weeks with a good response but still getting some morning stiffness, much better than before treatment, that faded away within 2 or 3 hours of taking Pred. Since then I have felt progressively better, although still get some early morning stiffness esp in my right arm - legs fine and I’ve even been swimming. I saw a Rheumatologist privately just over a week ago who said PMR most likely diagnosis, although will keep an open mind given some ‘atypical’ features (my age (56) and a slower overall response to pred  - significant improvement in 5 days rather than 3). By the time I saw him he noticed no signs of pain or restricted movement on examination and regards this as a good response. He has written to my GP with a suggested tapering regime and requested repeat bloods and a routine chest x ray, bone density scan as I’m also on thyroxine. He has put me on his nhs list for follow up. I genuinely feel much better now, and even the mild stiffness in the mornings is more than bearable and I doubt I would have gone to the Dr at all had this been all. I still find that if I over do it one day the next day stiffness is slightly worse but this always goes after the pred and does not return that day. So a couple of questions as I prepare for a discussion next week with my GP: is it usual for some aches and stiffness to remain (albeit much improved) as I describe? It is hard discussing symptoms with a GP that doesn’t see many cases and a specialist who admits he usually only sees unusual cases! On tapering the Rheumatologist has suggested staying on 15mg for a couple more weeks and then reducing to 12.5mg for 6 weeks and then down to 10. Does this sound right? my GP will be guided by me I suspect and I’d like to reduce initially more slowly at least getting to 12.5 in stages if I can maybe over a couple of weeks. Any views/advice?

Thinking it might be something at my house I went to a friends house and tried a cup there and again it was too salty for me to enjoy.
I think it might be the prednisone and was wondering if anyone else has experienced this?  BTW...Last night at dinner everything tasted fine.

"Hi everyone I hope you are all doing as well as can be.
I am so upset today as I have discovered my GP is not taking care of me.
initially in Nov last year I was diagnosed with PMR, put on 15mg pred, for 4 weeks then 12.5 for 4 weeks, now on 10 since 9th Jan.
I have had one blood test, that was to diagnose PMR, a CRP test, result 75 inflammation.
I have been told by GP to start cutting down the pred 1mg every 4 weeks, starting 26th Jan, until I am off them.
No further GP visits, no more blood tests and I have never been offered a bone density scan.
Through this forum, thanks so much to everyone! I realized I should be having a blood test, so I phoned the clinic and asked for one. I got the results today and the CRP is at 14. I have had no contact with the GP regarding this result.
Now I am feeling quite low and defeated, don't know what to do next!

I am also taking Leflunomide 10mgs. without too much trouble.

"Hello Community
Over last week have developed significant tremors.and muscle weakness 
Had cpk level done and emg which thankfully did not show steroid myopathy which was the thought, at this time but there was muscle
fatique and dont want that to progress to myopathy
Apparently tremors are a side effect of high dose steroids at the doses i have been on , and neurologist , and rheum are both trying to get me down at the very least to 10
I am at twenty down from the 30  , 25. the past month.
Also this is week 5 on metho, that we just increased from 10 to 15
Prob is all of a sudden the miracle pred was not relieving shoulder blade pain  hip  or hands  anymore. Felt same on thirty as do on 20, 
so  contention is why stay at high dose ?  And I agree
Can you get immune  to pred? 
Doc did a thoracic Mri and it did show some narrowing in the thoracic area as well as a bulge in the lumbar.
Backproblems are not new to me, had a cervical fusion with great results in 2014 
She wants me to go to physical therapy to slowly recondition muscles
and work on spine . 
I now wonder since my markers were never high, was this a spine issue all along?
And how much harm the meds may have done, since last march
where i have been hovering at 20 mg, going higher as well as lower.
I think i will tough out the pain, hopefully wean off the steroids,get off the metho  and have to resort.thru this all  Its not easy but I am at point where are think the meds are causing more issues than the disease
If i had relief at doses lower then 10mg would stay with it, but i cant get there. Hoping metho will kick in and but still need to respect adrenals and reduce slowly.
Not sure why fatigue remainsis so overwhelming though, thats not back issue 
So at a crosswords in a way, but all seems to be going wrong direction with these meds, , so we will see
Thanks for the outlet as always 
Wish all well

"Good day,  PMR is very new to me and I have completed my 1st week on Prednisolone. I have saved many of your useful posts into a folder whilst learning to understand more about PMR. I am on 15mg which I take each morning and it has largely reduced much of my stiffness and pain though my wrists hurt most days but that could be agravated by driving and my job,  I wake most night with leg aches and the pain seems to return to most joints early morning and then subside sometime after the meds are taken. So mornings are a problem So have to work from home mornings then drive into work in the after noon. I see a new rhumy next week after my awful experience with the first. Is it still early days to still have pain during the night/early mornings? Or does it take a little longer depending on the person to be completely free of pain?

"8 days ago I was diagnosed with PMR and started taking 15 mg of prednisolone once a day in the morning. My symptoms were reduced during the day and about 80% gone in the evening, but they returned during the night, so in the mornings the improvement was slight. After 4 days there was virtually no improvement in the mornings. I then increased the dosage to 20 mg taken in the morning. Same result.
It seemed to me that the pred isn't able to maintain a sufficient concentration in my body for a full 24 hours. Eileen writes somewhere that it lasts between 12-26 hours, so perhaps I am one of those with a high metabolism of pred. In any case I tried to take 15 mg in the morning and 5 mg at 2 am. What a difference! My symptoms are now down by about 90% throughout the day and night.
I had my ESR, CRP and Fibrinogen measured yesterday and they are all way down, just slightly elevated. My GP tells me to continue with the 15 + 5 mg schedule for a week and then start tapering. The question I have is, what is the best tapering schedule for a split dose like this? I would prefer to continue splitting, as this seems to work so much better.

I am currently tapering from 9 1/2 mg on the dsns method and doing not too badly at the moment PMR wise. I have had iritis for 40 years since I was 29 and since being on the Prednisolone for PMR have found that the bouts of iritis have reduced somewhat. However I am experiencing a flare of iritis at the moment which is annoying but this time I have some facial pain/neuralgia around the cheekbone.  Some eye discomfort too which I am treating with the usual pred 40 drops prescribed for the eye. My question is do any other sufferers experience this neuralgia. ( No headache or jaw ache etc ,just the cheekbone spreading to one side of nose)

"Hello! And thank you for checking out my post.
Two months ago, I awoke with severe lower back pain. Enough to wake me up. Since then I’ve had some degree of back pain which either A) wakes me up around 5am or 6am or B) gives me pain when I get up. Stiffness in the morning.
Since this began I’ve noticed these little bubbles on the side of my finger tips. I’ve had this before but they seem a bit more pronounced the last 2 months. Today they’re gone. But my skin looks older where they were. I’m only 33.
I’ve had some carpal tunnel symptoms, and random aches and pains throughout my body. 
Random, short lasting, eye pain. And one day, one of my eyes was noticably red. Had a stye too another day.
It’s been tolerable. But last Monday going on Tuesday night, the back pain was severe again and woke me up. 
I fear inflammatory back pain. I hope it’s just because I was lifting heavy 45lb weights, and might have injured something. The weights are on the floor and I have to bend down to get them. I didn’t feel any pain when lifting but maybe delayed pain?
This last week I’ve felt abdominal pain but could be cause of the ibuprofen I’ve been on.
In 2011, my colonoscopy revealed mild Proctitis.
I’ve also experienced itchyness in my heart(left side of the chest and center). Idk what’s that about.
I’m waiting for blood test results. An echocardiogram was also ordered and will be performed tomorrow.

Have had a headache for 3 days with a burning sensation. I've had this before.
Does anyone else get that burning/ stinging sensation with a headache?
My doctor wants me as low as possible (or even off) the prednisone asap.
I was down to 12.5 mg. of prednisone last month but was getting so many headaches my rheumatologist bumped me back up to 20mg. with hopes of lowering it when I see him on Feb. 12.  Still getting more than my share of headaches.
I am supposed to start the IV of acterma in the next couple of weeks. How long can you be on acterma & what comes next?
The PMR is manageable at the moment. I get neck & shoulder pain but that's not nearly as upsetting as the headaches right now.
The fatigue is just overwhelming.
Some days I have a difficult time getting out of bed. Last night I went to sleep @ 1 a.m. & didn't get up till 12:45 p.m. & I could have just stayed in bed but my hubby was waiting for me so we could have lunch together.
I am blessed to have such a supportive & caring husband. He drives me 4 hours round trip to my doctor every month.
We are both just so happy to have this doctor to take care of me we would still go to him if it meant a overnight stay. Must have confidence in your doctor or it's time to find another one.

Gradually I have started to stiffen, first my right shoulder, but maybe rotarar cuff injury, and now my hips.
I have had bloods but they showed nothing remarkable CPR and ESR 2 and 3.  The GP gave me anmitripylone to help with my neck and shoulder but it has not helped with the stiffness in my hips.

"The PMR went into remission for the second time in 3 years and I enjoyed 6 months of no prednisone bliss, then all the dreaded symptoms returned rapidly.  Rather than start back at 15 mg Pred, which is what my Rheumy started me on at my last relapse, I chose to start at 2.5, which halfway worked, so moved up to 5 mg.  I felt 100% better on that dose, and since I am out of my home state for an extended period, called my Rheumy to tell him and ask for a
refill.  He did provide the refill and suggested I see another Rheumy in my area, because he said it is possible it is another problem.  I do have an appointment with him at the end of March.
I disagree with him simply because I feel fine.  My question for the forum is how shall I proceed from this lower level with the DSNS method which worked twice before but higher dosage start?

"Hi Everyone, I’m hoping someone can help. I was diagnosed with GCA on 27.12.17 after going to the GP with what I thought was sinusitis.
I had been feeling rough for a while beforehand and looking back think it all fits together - knee and hip pain, and back pain ( stiff in the morning and after sitting),  and pain in my upper back between my shoulders. I know it sounds silly but I just thought it was aches and pains from doing too much - I work about 50+ hours a week as a teacher and have 3 kids at home too.
Anyway, the doctor sent me for a blood test and when the inflammatory markers came back high (33?) he said it was Temporal Arteritis. He started me on 20mg  Prednisolone but said I wouldn’t need any more follow up and that was it. Well, I had never heard of it- so I started to look into what it is and came across information about polymyalgia. I was also worrying that i wasn’t going to be seen again - so I went back to the GP. I saw a different GP and she said she didn’t think I had GCA but in the absence of any other diagnosis and the fact that I had responded quickly to the pred she upped the dose of the pred as she said the initial dose wasn’t high enough. She asked me to have a repeat blood test a week later and then go back. I did this and was telephoned by the original GP I had seen. He was Adamant his diagnosis was accurate - but said that as my inflammation level was now ‘normal’ I should reduce the dose of pred. He told me to reduce 5mg every 3 days. 
I started doing this and straightaway realised that this was going to make me feel ill- so instead have been reducing by 2.5 every 2. 
Anyway, I am now down to 7mg pred and I can feel my facial pain symptoms returning. I have really lost confidence in the GP’s - I am not sure what to ask for,  whether to push for a specialist referral !? Whether it is possible for me to even have GCA and / or polymyalgia? Or whether there is another condition they should be considering? I am also not sure what they ‘should’ be doing if they genuinely think I have GCA. I’m sorry for the really long post but I would be enormously grateful for any advice or support -

"Hi Eilean,  I read in a discussion that Shortness of Breath was not uncommon with this condition because it can affect respiratory muscles as well.   I am wondering if this can ever be an early symptom.    I had been experiencing problems with breathing with exertion for a few years which was gradually getting worse.   I saw a respirologist and had just about every lung test done with them all not showing anything to cause it.   They then did an antihistamine test and decided perhaps I had asthma, but I do not think I did as the inhalers did not help, but when he put me on prednisone my breathing was much better and I generally felt much better.   It was not until a year or so later that my muscles in my legs and arms began to feel extremely weak and I had pain especially in my arms and shoulders.    At the time I felt that my Dr. did not understand or perhaps believe how weak and unwell that I felt.   Have you ever heard of breathing problems being an early symptom prior to the others?   Thanks

"Hi everyone, I am so glad to have found this forum and have read and read as much as possible. It's not so lonely anymore.
I was diagnosed with polymyalgia in November last year. I did not want to take steroids but feel tricked by my Dr who told me I would only be on them for 2 to 3 months. I was so upset to discover that's not the case at all.
Anyway what I wanted to ask was if anyone is on or has tried the anti inflammation diet? If so what are your experiances and how do you know which foods to eat? Any help appreciated.

"Hello  everyone..  Some of you may remember me, I have had PMR for three years and I still cannot taper off.  But, what I want to know from anyone out there is this:  I have to go on a bone building medication.  Doctor says Forteo  injections, or Prolio, or the oral older meds (Fosamax, etc.)  
Please I would so appreciate hearing from those of you who are on one of these (or other)meds and are NOT having any side effects.  Inother words, I want to know if anyone has had a good experience with these meds and would recommend one or more of them.  I thank you for any responses. The fact that any of these drugs can cause deterioration of the jaw bone, kind of scares me.  
Thank you again.  MJ

"Hello All
The flu is hitting hard in my state as well as others
Realitively healthy adults as well as a few children have passed away,and I C U s are full of poor sufferers.
The strain was not covered in this years flu shot, but they say if 
had it ,it seems to not be as terrible.
 i never get the flu shot, and my internist(not my rheumi)said actually since my immune system is compromised from pred, ( and. now methotrexate) probably wouldnt have built up immunity anyway.
I am being to second guess this, and wonder what the community thinks.
I will ask my  rheumi tomorrow as well.
Never got the flu, even without the shots over the years, but have never been on these meds...

Now im not at all sure  i have that right but im sure some kind person on here will put me right. Is it the ACTH Stimulation test which seems rather involved. I am down to 1.5mg but reluctant to go any further as i have a few issues which the physio is working on 1. I have bursitus (not sure u spell it like that) in my hip. 2. I have pain in my neck but she is concentrating on my shoulder, she thinks there maybe inflammation there so i am having a blood test on thursday. She thinks i should put the dosage up but i really really dont want to if i have this test it might put my mind at rest. I feel fine except for these 2 issues. I did put the dosage up to 7 a while back but it didnt make any difference ive also had a cortisone injection which didnt make any difference nor did the Bowen Therapy.

"Hello, Is there anyone that could advise me please. I was diagnosed 4 years ago with PMR and GC even though I had
normal blood results. I was put high dose steroids and my pains disappeared in 3 days.
I have been on a rollercoaster ride ever since. I have had 1500mg iv. and numerous kenalog injections. I have now managed to get down to
2mg. I have now got to the stage that I cannot get up from a chair, cannot turn my head, shoulders ache and feel really down.
Every time I see a different rhuemy and apart from the one who diagnosed me they all think I have not and have never had PMR or GC (GC was diagnosed with ultrasound).
All I know is that I am in really bad pain and stiffness.
I don't know what to believe or do. Should I increase my steroids for relief or just live with this pain?
Also do you think that all the steroids I have taken has done long term damage.

"I am 69 and was diagnosed with PMR late Nov 2017.  I have had a negative temporal artery biopsy which is great and no eye problems or jaw pain while chewing. I have not seen Rheumatologist as yet as they are on holiday as it's summer here in New Zealand. I started on 15mgs prednisone and ibuprofen and not enough and then I went up to 20mgs and Celebrex. I did my 1st reduction of 2.5mgs (on phone advice to GP from rheumatologist) a week ago ( which was 6 weeks from diagnosis) and I wake quite stiff and sore. Shoulders, hands and neck and back are all like this but once I have had my prednisone I take about 90minutes and I improve and am not too bad for rest of the day. I am supposed to drop another 2.5mgs in another week. Any advice and are my morning aches and pains considered within a normal parameter for PMR?

"I'm a 69-year-old female.
Diagnosed in August with GCA/PMR.
My doctor has been gradually decreasing my prednisone. Currently, I'm at 12.5mg. Have been on this dosage since Thanksgiving.
I am having problems with headache's & soreness in my scalp.
I have neurothopy in my feet & have been taking gabapentin for about 2 year's I'm at the highest dose of it 2400 mg. daily. Recently my feet have been bothering me at bedtime & I only noticed it once the prednisone was reduced.
I don't know if there is any correlation here or not. Just find it to be odd.
Does anyone else have foot problems with GCA/ PMR? 
I see my rheumatologist on Monday. He is a very good doctor.
I go to MUSC (Medical Univ. Of S.C.) one & one have hour's from home but worth the drive.
Didn't want to bring it up & look like a fool if there is nothing to be concerned about.
The fatigue is really crazy with this autoimmune disease.
Prior to the GCA/PMR diagnoses, I was diagnosed almost 2 year's ago with Sjogrens Syndrom...yet another autoimmune disease.
Just more of a curious question.
My feet have really been bothering me at bedtime.

"Hi everyone,
I am new to this - diagnosed since Dec 14th only.  I was at home recovering from a hip labral tear surgery and doing pretty good.  I went on a cruise that visited Mexico and Honduras and when I got back I had a low grade fever for 4 days and my teeth were all hurting.  I chalked it up to a virus.  Then one morning the following week I woke up with stiff shoulders/hips/neck, a great amount of fatigue, terrible malaise, and not too interested in eating.  I lost 12 lbs.  When I saw the Rheumatologist the first time he chalked it up to you have a virus, here is some Cellebrex for the inflammation and I will see you in 3 months.  A week later I was getting worse so I returned and begged him to listen to me.  I told him that this is not me, I am physically fit and very active and now I feel like I am 85 but I am only 52.  He put me on prednisone and after 2 doses was feeling more like me - I felt great!  Now a couple of weeks later I still feel like there is that 20% of me and my energy missing....Did anyone else experience that great feeling to a little less great?  Did your doctors think that it stemmed from a virus?

"Good Morning!  This is my first posting on this very welcoming, informative site.
Over the past year, I've been treated for psoriatic arthritis/fibromyalgia, breast cancer, melanoma and PMR.
My story began iIn July, 2017, at a follow-up visit to my rheumatologist, she asked if I ever experienced pain in my neck, shoulders, upper arms and/or hips.  Since I've suffered chronic pain for the past 12 years, I answered yes because I always have pain somewhere in my body, but it has been manageable with hydrocodone.  When I honestly answered I did at times have pain in the areas she mentioned, she stated definitively, ""You have Polymalgia Rheumatica and I'm starting you on 10 mg of prednisone"". 
A month later at a follow-up visit, I listed for her the long list of side effects I'd begun having from the prednisone, including fatigue, shortness of breath, excessive sweating and shaking and brain fog.  She didn't address any side effects except for brain fog, stating it was caused by the hydrocodone.  She informed me she was cutting my dosage in half. 
The next 3 months were horrible for me.  I managed to reduce the prednisone from 10 mg. to 6 mg., with the side effects becoming more pronounced.  I was unable to leave my house except for doctors' appointments because of the sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, etc.  I also realized that the pain I had told her I experienced when she questioned me was no different than before the diagnosis. 
The drastic reduction in my pain meds left me feeling even more fatigued and fragile.  I also realized that taking the hydrocodone over a ten year period had never caused brain fog as she stated.  I messaged her requesting her advice about weaning off the prednisone and restarting the full dose of pain meds.  The message and a follow-up phone call to her office went unanswered. 
Now convinced, after reading all the messages and responses on this site, that I had probably never had PMR, I slowly weaned myself off all prednisone.  Nothing unusual happened after I stopped the pred. The side effects gradually dissipated.  I did, however, experience the return of all my prior arthritis pain.  I asked her to prescribe my usual full dose of hydrocodone, but she adamantly refused, saying I would overdose.  I have not once varied from the original prescribing guidelines, asked for an increase in dosage or requested the medication before the fill date.  I was on the prednisone for four months, never experienced any ""flares"" or felt any additional pain other than what had been normal for me for 12 years. 
Has anyone ever experienced anything similar to my strangely haphazard diagnosis?  Any thoughts or ideas that I was misdiagnosed?  Thank you, one and all.  Good wishes for your speedy recoveries.

Ever since I have been diagnosed with PMG about 4 years ago I have suffered with extreme tiredness but I can't separate the two possibilities of the cause.
What do you think is the cause of the tiredness, the actual Polymyalgia or the Prednisolone medication as the two go hand in hand, anyone suffering with PMG is going to be on medication.

"HI,  over the past 2 weeks I have felt increasingly, stronger, less fatigued, and less mental fogginess.   2 days this week I went out shopping and stayed for about 6 hours.   Over the past 2 years,  If I could shop for an hour without having to go home to go  to sleep I was lucky.   Does this mean that the polymyalgia has resolved and I have recovered.   Has anyone else experienced this?   I am still on Prednisone which was started when they finally gave me a diagnosis in March, 2017.   I have been up and down from 20 daily, with not much success at decreasing it.   I am now on 17 and have had no problems with this small decrease using the slow method.  I am assuming that because of the nature of prednisone that I will still have to continue with this slow decrease, but thought I would check with those of you who have and are experiencing this disease.    I do not see my rheumatologist until May, although I know he would see me earlier if necessary.   However to be honest although I do like him very much I trust your direction on this a bit more than his.    Thanks so much for your input.

My question is: are there any specific resources on patient.uk for this disorder?

"Yesterday I decided to try taking a probiotic.  I have had an unsettled stomach since starting prednisone plus recently I realized that I have silent acid reflux.
Last night I read the entire label of the probiotic and discovered that it says you should not take it if you are ""...undergoing long-term corticosteroid treatment.""
Then I did some on-line searching about this and many sites say the same.  The reasoning is that it is believed that probiotics increase your immune system.  This is just the opposite of what we need as we are taking prednisone to quiet down our immune system.
I assume yogurts are ok because their bacterias are a natural effect of the fermentation process in making the yogurt.  From reading the forum I know that many people take yogurt with their prednisone. 
Personally I cannot eat dairy and am having trouble finding an unsweeted non-dairy product (prednisone is affecting my ability to digest simple sugars), but there are still some stores I can check out....but I digress.

"i am sick with a cold, maybe bronchitis, totally miserable.  Here is my question:  should I go up on the pred?  Currently I'm on the back half of going from 6.5 to 6, using the dsns method.  I ache all over, I'm coughing, I'm weak, etc.  hip and groin stiffness is pronounced, probably from sitting and laying so much rather than moving around.
if you think I should increase the pred, for how much and for how long?  I won't go to urgent care as they just tell you to take over the counter meds for the cold and cough and wait it out...3 weeks is the norm, they say. Thanks!

"I am a 62 year old female. I've had PMR for over 4 years but have only treated it for 2 years. It took a while to figure out what I had as an overactive thyroid masked many symptoms. It was so bad I couldn't get out of bed, my car or the couch. I had become stagnant from years of exercise and activity.
I am currently on 5 mg of Prednizone, down from 15 in the last year. I gradually took it down for a year in 2013 and it came back so, back on 15mg in 2014 and the gradual decline. I'm staying steady at 5mg. I have a few aches but not many. I am very active, I cycle 10-50 mi at a time, swim and kayak. I will not let this stupid illness take me down.
The question I have is how many of you suffer from head sweats, and just plain HOT all the time? I did not have this issue last summer but this summer is awful. I need a towel and AC to cool down. Is this a side affect of the PMR or Prednizone?

"Hi All,
I would like to seek some advice. I have experienced pain initially from my neck all the way to my upper back and onto my hand. This was because of poor posture and long periods of them sitting at the computer. I am undergoing treatment for my back and arm pain (mild) and all is good. I noticed a very hard or so you say stiffness in the pectoralis major muscle for my chest wall. If i feel the difference between the left and right, the left seems to be a lot harder than the right. And it also making it look imbalanced. Now the catch is, this hardness in the chest muscle developed quickly, and its painless however it is making me worry. I was trying to explain to several doctors and no one seems to benefit me or give me the solution to stop it. I have been currently advised to do a CT Scan for this place and the back along with my arm but I am not convinced yet. As CT scans are done for far more major purposes.Do I need to do it and show the doctor? Although he said this could be nothing, but the picture was unclear to him. I have done the MRi already but it was mainly for the cervical spine. I was worried that why this happened to me and I am not sure whether to think its from cigarettes or something else. I can explain to you further if anyone is interested to drop me a quick reply. And if you know some good medication to relax this muscle would be great (of course safe medication and not a bunch of side effect).
Thanks

"Polymyalgia after 2 years……………. December 2017
At Christmas Miss Poly will be two years old
Mr Pred who’s the steroid, he helps with the load
I’m now down to 8 which proved very slow
And the drop for one week leaves me feeling quite low
There’s only one answer to keep me pain free
Take two thirds in bed and one third after tea
I’m lucky I guess, Mr Pred does his stuff
He works really hard then I don’t feel too rough 
And when I bounce back from the horrible drop
I’m out and about and I try not to stop
I see all my friends, try to have a good time
But I’m careful to cut down carbs, sugar and wine
And as I drop down I am hoping to see
A gradual improvement and find the old me
And eventually make it to down under 5  
And feel almost normal, be completely alive
So all of us must live with eternal hope
And battle the demon and try hard to cope
Remember that star burns up high in the sky
So we mustn’t complain and ask reasons why
HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL and a Happy New Year
Let’s all face the future with cheer and less fear 
We’ll raise glasses high and give a High Five
And just thank the Lord we are all still alive

"I was rushed into hospital the autumn of 2016 when I seized up and couldn't move. Reactive arthritis was diagnosed and I was put on a short course of steroids. Them a few weeks later I started again and saw the rheumatologist as an outpatient. He was sure it was reactive arthritis again and said he'd inform my GP however he then wrote to me saying that after consultation with my GP he'd decided it was polymyalgia and that he was passing me back to the GP to manage my treatment. So just before Xmas last year I was
Started on a dose of 25mg of prednisolone. This was then reduced slowly at first with the GP taking blood tests for inflammation before each reduction however the reduction soon speeded up so that at the end of November I finished taking it,even though I have been in constant pain since about May and even though I have kept informing the GP.All he keeps saying is that l show no sign of inflammation. Now he only sees me at 2 monthly intervals.Eventually after much pressure I gave in and was put on a anti-depression tablets and, again after pressure gave in and let him refer me to a psychiatrist. It's no wonder I am depressed- I have lost over 3 stone in weight within a very short time,am in constant pain and can hardly eat. It has taken a great deal of pressing by myself,my husband,my daughter- a highly qualified ICU nurse, and my son for him to refer me for any sort of test. Now I've had an endoscopy which showed little, am booked in for an X-ray of my spine, have an appointment with the psychiatrist, and awaiting a clinic appointment with a consultant regarding the endoscopy. I believe the problem still to be that l taken off the prednisolone far too quickly. The GP admitted that reading the results of inflammation tests is - Innis words 'an inexact science'. Now I'm hoping that when I get to see the consultant concerned with digestive problems that he'll refer me across to the rheumatologist - as I live in Scotland this can be done. What more can I do? I've seen 2 other partners in the practice, but1 is his wife and he's convinced the newer younger partner I'm neurotic, I live in a very small village and there's only 1 other practice who, from what I've heard are no better. I really want to hear other thoughts on this as I've been reduced from a highly qualified professional to a complete wreck now unable to do anything at all.

"this is probably the dumbest post ever, but I obsess over things, so here goes:  some people with pmr are never pain free.  I am one of those people,  I got pmr in August, 2016, started pred late September 2016.  I am never pain free.  And I have lots of pred side effects, the common ones:  increased blood pressure, blood sugar, weight gain, etc.  on a good day I can walk 5000 steps but only in short spurts.
here is my question (my husband says I'm nuts):  if I am never pain free, and never have been, how will I know when I am pmr free as I reduce on the pred?  Right now I'm using dsns to get to 6 mg,  I'm not any better than I was since I started pred.  I've always had groin stiffness and leg muscle pain especially in the mornings.  
So...let's say I manage to work my way down to 1 mg. pred...and I still have the same level of stiffness and soreness that I've had all along....I'm assuming I can't get off the pred because the pmr is still active, and I sure don't want a flare.
Please don't tell me to increase the pred right now...I've done that a couple times, all the way back up to 10 mg...no difference whatsoever, but remember, I'm not one of the ones who is pain free...I've never been pain free.  Before I started on the initial dose of pred (20 mg) I was bedridden with pmr pain--had bad case.
i guess my question is:  when and if the pmr burns itself out, shouldn't I expect to be eventually pain free before I can get off the pred altogether?  (Yes, I understand that some people never do--but I'm just sitting here obsessing over life in general so thought I would turn to you all for thoughts).  Thank you!

"I had an inactive period of 6 months when I developed this calf pain outer side of my left leg. I dont feel any loss of strength I think, there is no size difference between the legs, it does not at all happen in the other leg, and it goes away with exercise.
It doesn't always happen, sometimes none in a week, sometimes twice or more. I don't remember living a whole week with pain. So it comes and goes very frequently. I am 26 years old, 180cm and 85 kg, I am not overweight, have been quite active my whole life and now I am too. I just was depressed in that period of 6 months.
Since I got this pain I started cycling to fix the problem, in the last 10 months I've done over 2500 km but pain is still there. It is never there when biking. And most of the times no pain the night after biking. And cycling seems to help as I get fewer pain sessions when I frequently bike. Massaging also helps the pain. Its not a sharp pain, kind of dull and the intensity of pain changes everytime. Sometimes very slight, sometimes very disturbing where I have to get something done on it. What do you think might be the reason?

I started a discussion a few months ago about the pain I was experiencing.   I stopped taking prednisone about 6 months ago after 3.5 years but was never pain free from about 5mg, the pain never changed as I came down to nil over many months .   I now have other conditions such as carpel tunnel, diverticulitis, sciatica and foot problems after surgery to replace my big toe joint.  My feet really hurt, neck, forearms, knees, my esr rate is 18, the doctor has now told me I have fibromyalgia.   I've probably had it at the same tim as PMR.

"Hello everyone, it's seems ages since I've contributed anything to the forum but many of you know I run holiday cottages, I'm still decorating the house, I run an auction site for charity and along with all the daily tasks that we all do there's very little time to contribute. But, I do follow every posting and I read all the fantastic advice given that any contribution made by me would be simply a repeat of all that's been said. 
This year I have successfully made the final reduction! I followed Eileen's dead slow and almost stop method and throughout my journey it's proved invaluable. I had a sort of flare when I reached .05mg when the pain returned to my hips and knees but funnily not my neck, shoulders or arms. I simply upped the dose back to 2mg and all the pain vanished. I slowly reduced once again and this time all seems well. I'm currently 1 day zero, 1 day .05mg  and I hope that come 01st January I will join the zero club completely.
I was hoping that along with the steroid reduction my blood pressure would somewhat return to normal but alas it hasn't although I am still at least 2 stone overweight so that could be the issue for the high blood pressure and so that is still obviously an issue that still needs to be worked through.
I, was only 51 when after 3 months of hell and no help from my GP was eventually diagnosed with PMR by a Rheumatologist, and unlike many of you (which is very sad to read about), have had the support of this wonderful Rheumatologist who supported my adoption of the dead slow and almost stop method of reduction, stopped the Alendronic Acid that had been prescribed by a locum GP and booked me in for a Dexa scan which came back perfect. Support is vital to get us all through the highs and lows of this condition and as well as my Rheumatologist I had this forum too. Thank you all so much.
As well as wishing you all a wonderful Christmas and all Best Wishes for the coming New Year I want to say that in the darkest hours we all despair about our 'lot' with this condition but hang on in there...It can be a long old haul but with support we can all get to a position whereby the condition can be easily managed even if it's forever or if we're lucky it will burn itself out. I wish you all every success with your PMR journey. With all kind regards, Tina.

"Exactly nine years ago (on the Lucia Day, December 13) I got off pred and have been free from pmr and GCA. I chose the Lucia Day to say when I got off pred as it is easy to remember. This year I think about Lucia bringing light in the darkness and let Lucia bring you light and hope that there is an end in the dark tunnel of pmr and GCA. Lucia is celebrated each year on December 13 and she is dressed in white with candles/lights in her hair. She also have attendants - for instance boys called star boys and also girls. It is a very old tradition and this morning, we have looked at a TV programme with traditional Lucia songs. We also have a special bun that looks like the figure 8 and with two raisins on it in the 0´s. In Swedish we call it Lussekatt (Lucia is sometimes called Lusse and katt means cat - I don´t know why it is called lussekatt).
As you see, there is a light at the end of the pmr/GCA and if you are lucky like me, you don´t get it back. Have a nice Lucia day! . 
If you want to know more about our tradition you can google Wikipedia Saint Lucy´s Day.

"I haven't been writing to this forum for a while, although I follow the discussions with much interest. I am still of course frustrated that while both GCA and PMR can be managed with corticosteroids ,etc, perhaps sometimes until they ""burn out"", there is no ""cure"" as yet.
I've had both ailments for just over four years, starting was I was a very fit 72. So far I've been coping fairly well. I was interested to note an advert this forum presented regarding the WU Medical Centre in Beijing. (I assume it can be mentioned since the forum has advertised it.) I wrote the centre to ascertain if, amongst other auto immune maladies,the centre  could treat mine. I would be prepared to travel to China for treatment, if need be and there were to be some prospect of success.
Alas I received a reply stating that the centre doesn't treat GCA/PMR, but suggested I might look at taking injections to deal with TNF- Tumor Necrosis Factor ( I didn't know anything about that, but neither did I know anything about GCA and PMR some 50 months ago when they struck). DR. GOOGLE came up with some sites covering this.  The clearest one I saw thus far is ""Very Well"" which explains TNF and its relation to auto immune diseases. Also it describes some quite new treatment procedures. But it was also suggested that I consult a genetics professional too- IF I can find one.
Question:
Does any member of this forum have any experience with TNF and the treatments- periodic injections- that might also serve to deal with GCA and PMR? Or any advice to offer?

I am now waiting to start Leflunomide. Pred. has never reduced my inflammation enough, so she is trying something else. I should have been on it already, but a urine infection put paid to that, I told her that I had suddenly started feeling better about five weeks ago. I had to reduce the Pred. to have a PET/CT scan, and felt terrible, after the scan, I increased it to what it had been, and felt the fatigue lessening. She said the next blood tests I had, the level on one marker, had dropped from 72 to 20, but of course it could be a number of reasons. I still can't believe that the tiredness is so much decreased, I'm just so grateful. Here's hoping it carries on.

Over a year ago now I woke up with a stiff and achy neck, shoulder and between shoulder blades. After several doctors visits I eventually got x rays and a rheumatologist said I had early OA in my neck and spine. I stared physio but I stopped because it was making me giddy. I've had ECG, electrocardiogram, 24 hour heart monitor, heart related bloods, all OK.
However, my neck aches are still there and more recently I have aches in both shoulders. I get tired easily, feel woozy sometimes especially with head movements, painful knees, feet, wrists, and sometimes hips. I have tinnitus, headaches also since diagnosis. Recently I suggested PMR to my GP, he thinks my symptoms are OA related. A few months ago my blood showed raised inflammation but more recently my bloods show abnormal or raised plasma viscosity which I have to see him about. I take paracetamol and aspirin with caffeine for pain, the aspirin could be causing my tinnitus. Does this sound like PMR?
If you think not then please don't reply because I am a terrible worrier. I take bendroflumethiazide 2.5mg for border line BP but they do help to prevent migraines. I also take Citalopram 10mg for anxiety.
Thank you for reading.

"have been on 7.5 for several months with fairly mild discomfort.
have now had a couple of weeks with more discomfort not being able to walk far and legs quite painful. Have had to up my dose in hope all will settle down again. Refused to admit I needed to up my dose as hoping my body would settle, have been using the slow reduction method with success up until now. Had hoped I would be off pred in the next year or so...seems highly unlikely.

"My doctor has put me on 40mg a day for 7 days, then I have to go down to 35mg a day for 7 days and then I have to go down to 30mg for 7 days and so on. Does this sound normal? reading everywhere it seems this might be a bit excessive. I do wonder about my doctor, I don't have much confidence in him, but he is the only doctor in our town. He also told me to take anti depressents as I might be depressed, I told him I am very down because of the incredible pain I am in! I was practically a cripple. On the up side - within 24 hours my pain and stiffness had reduced significantly, I feel like a new woman! I was so excited to show my husband I could walk up the stairs without having to old the banister and hoist myself up.

"I was recently prescribed ibuprofen even though the Dr told me when I first developed PMR not to take it, I said to her I thought we couldn't take, didn't really catch her reply( a bit deaf these days) anyway I asked the pharmacist , she said she wouldn't but speak to the Dr.  The Dr said also if I wanted I could have a steroid injection, im wondering if it is any good if you have PMR, its for my neck which has been really painfull for ab 3mths now. I am down to 2 - 2 - 1/2 and apart from the neck and a bit stiff in my hip when I sit for a long period I am doing ok. Your views on the injections please! Thanks Liz

"I've been slowly tapering my pred. I've had problems in the past tapering down successfully as some of you may remember. I've
been tapering in 0.5mg increments over 2-3 weeks and usually have flu like symptoms for a couple of days after, probably withdrawal symptoms, but I just cope with that.
Since dropping to 7.5mg though, I've been feeling unwell for about 10 days. Is this the point where my adrenals try to kick in? I know it's somewhere around here, although my rheumy says it's 5mg.
I have some other medical issues as well, some new and some not so new, so maybe it's a combination. The new ones are glucose intolerance, ie pre diabetic. I've followed a low GI diet since mid August and have lost well over a stone, or 7kg. The pred certainly didn't take any prisoners in my case!
I have to say, for those who don't know me that I have GCA and have been on really high doses of pred for a long time.
The other newish one is tachycardia, lots of tests and am waiting to find out if I'll have to go on beta blockers. There's a conflict with an inhaler I use for something else. Not looking forward to that one!
So...to cut a long story short, am I now at the point where my adrenal glands are coming back to life?

"I know that Prednisone can cause weight gain, but how unusual is it for a person not to gain weight while taking it.   I've been on 60 mg. for about five weeks now.  The first two weeks, my ankles were swollen, but that went away and now, I continue to maintain my usual weight with no unusual swelling or bloating.   Does the weight gain come with longer use of Pred. or do some people just not gain at all?
    One other thing:  My hair is not falling out, but it just doesn't seem to be growing at all in certain places.   It it, however, very dry and lifeless.   Is this a side effect of Prednisone and how have you all dealt with this, especially the lifelessness?  Any supplements which would help this? 
thanks

"Perhaps a post just on Bowen Technique and how it has helped with your Polymyalgia or other healing experiences would be nice to have.
I of course had never heard of it until I got on this wonderful forum.
The Bowen practitioner I found is 90 miles (144 kilometers) away, but I now feel it's worth my drive over there, pains and all. 
I was glad someone here posted what to expect, because someone new might think it's odd the practitioner would leave the room so quick. But, it's that time alone with your self that is required. Time for the Central Nervous System to kick in.
Click here to view image
Sometimes a concentration of pain, yet not pain, in one of my PMR spots, she said sometimes the energy of the CNS (Central Nervous System) gets stuck.
One time she worked on my hipflexors. When she left the room I felt like one leg was floating in the air, while the other was heavy.
I've never fallen asleep, but sometimes I'm so relaxed the thoughts in my head just don't complete a sentence. Sometimes our minds think about life too much, but Bowen is best if you only be in that moment, think of your self, your central nervous system flowing, doing it's natural job, removing tension you are putting your self in from your thoughts. 
 I had better stop, my editor is acting funny, don't want to lose all this. Please post your experiences.  Let's try to keep the thoughts on Bowen for this post if possible so it can be a reference.

"I'm sure you all know how I support trying the use of Bowen therapy alongside the more traditional (i.e. steroid) approach for PMR. I would never try to claim it works for the underlying cause or the PMR itself but I do believe it helps with what I call ""The Add-ons"" that most of us experience at some time or other. 
A new member, Sarah, is interested in feedback so please could we all say our piece, whether it worked for you or not.

"A month ago I saw my GP for a flare up of my asthma and also muscle pains and stiffness. She prescribed me 40mg of prednisone for a week and said if I also had PMR then the symptoms would improve.
Well I had a complete recovery the day after my first dose, I could say miraculous. As asked I saw my Dr a few weeks later, the symptoms were returning and she started me on prednisone 15mg a day. Obviously I wasn’t expecting such a great result on a lower dose, but my questions are - 
1) How much do your symptoms resolve before you reduce the dose? 
2) Do they go away, or do they just get better?
3) What happens with a ‘flare up’?
Thank you

"Hello everyone, I am so glad I found so much valuable information from real people with real stories in this group. What I missed, though, the age of the people suffering from this illness. It is important to me as I am 38 old woman and two months ago I suddently started having severe shoulder pain and a feeling of ""a knife stabbed"" into my each top part of the arms. Which went away through the day. Well, for a first week only. Second week from the start of the symptoms I started having pain in my small joints like fin gers and wrists. Third week on pain in my hip, shin pain, knee joints, neck. By week 4 I simply was bed-bound. Need assistance going to toilet. And it did not go away not even for a bit. Although, it did feel better in the second part of the day. Painkillers did no good. So sleepless nights and agonising days. GP, first, thought I've got reactive arthritis and put me on 15mg prednisolone for 15days. Tappering down every 5 days. It did ease the pain but not completelly. I never was pain free within those 15 days. After I stopped steroids, the very next day I was in agonising pain, crying and unable to move a finger. Then I saw another GP, who suggested I might have Polymyalgia. He put me on 30mg pred a day. The very next day I could sleep through the night. Two days later I was much better. 7 days later got back to physical training. I am on this dose for 4 weeks now. And should reduce the dose to 20mg in a few days time. Which I am really worried about after reading many of your posts and comments. I would not be able to cope with that pain once again.
My question is how common is to have this condition at this age? Do you guys have joint pain as well as muscle pain? I only found few sources that say polymyalgia also may lead to joint pain. I am really scared, lost and feel like sitting on a bomb. Any comments welcome and appreciated a lot.

"I don't know how many of you will remember me having been on here many times with questions and concerns and problems tons of problems. Well I had an MRI done yesterday on my right hand. My rheumatologist requested that because it was hurting the most of my two hands. I have been experiencing horrible joint pain the last couple of weeks. And I suspected that it could be from Sjogren's syndrome but I can't get in to have a lip biopsy done for a couple of weeks. Anyway my rheumatologist just called me to tell me that the MRI showed rheumatoid arthritis or actually they called it inflammatory arthritis on the report she's the one who said rheumatoid arthritis. She even said I might be able to get off the prednisone. I think she's thinking I don't have PMR but instead I have rheumatoid arthritis. Personally I think I still have PMR in addition but I'll just have to wait and see. I'm going to see her in the office on Tuesday next week where she has to do some kind of testing and reporting. I know she mentioned testing for lupus. And this is to get Medicare to pay for my medication for the rheumatoid arthritis. It's basically a bunch of hoops she and I have to jump through so that I can get the proper treatment covered by insurance.

"Hello, am new and hoping to get some feedback as I have felt so lost before finding this ….
I was elated when I came across this site to finally find others that faced some of the same challenges I have since being diagnosed with PMR in August 2011. It came on suddenly. In fact the first diagnosis was an encapsulated shoulder, the right shoulder aching terribly and losing range of motion, requiring physical therapy. However within days my left shoulder also ached, but it was part of the more moving aching discomfort that also went to my neck, upper back, hips, tops of my thighs, buttocks, knees, shins, top of my feet, ankles, forearms, wrists, and top of my hands. It was uncomfortable to drive keeping my knees or ankles in the same position for even 20 minutes. I also found it uncomfortable to cross my legs at my shins or ankles on top of one another as the pressure was unbearable.
I have had 2 Rheumatologists treat me. The first diagnosed me and began me on 15 mg of prednisone which made me a new woman. This went well until this doctor wanted me to begin going down on the prednisone and had me try 10 mg, which brought about a relapse. His answer was pain management for further help. I switched Rheumatologists and the new one had a slower approach for going down on the prednisone. I have worked out regularly for years, when the shoulder began the physical therapists had told me I wouldn’t lift weights and workout the same again. This new doctor told me to go ahead and workout as much as I felt I could. I did well until I tried to go below 2.5 mg. This is the third time I’ve tried, and by the third day I go into relapse. My doctor gives me a shot but it takes better than a week for me to get back to where I had been.
The relapses seem harder now, the discomfort seems turned up higher. The fatigue comes over me like a veil and the appetite disappears. I live alone with my big pup so this isn’t always easy. My concern is that I have a lot of other body parts that are involved, I’ve seen some posts on this site that touch on them but my discomfort areas seem much more widespread (areas listed above). The doctor had brought up fibromyalgia but she also stated that those symptoms are not eased by prednisone, and all my symptoms go away when the higher amounts of prednisone are in my system. Does anyone else experience the same? Also, I do not experience any real stiffness in the morning, my discomfort actually gets worse the more I am upright. I’ve had my body scanned, its not any kind of back or hip issue, all that moves fine, I can exercise, twist and turn with no pain. It’s a deep, moving ache…mostly constant in the shoulder, upper back. Especially now as I’m still coming around from the last attempt at 2 mg of prednisone.
Thank you for reading this and allowing me to be a part of your inner most thoughts. Have a joyful day.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in July 2016.  My rheumatologist started me out with 20 mg Pred for 2 weeks then down to 10 and continued to go down until October 2016 I got down to 4 1/2 mg and symptoms came back.  He put me back to 8 mg and I eventually  got down to 5 mg in May 2017.  At that time he added 15 mg MTX and folic acid.  In Sept. 2017 I noticed slight symptoms coming back plus shortness of breath.  I am assuming the MTX is doing no good and is also causing shortness of breath.  No other side effects at this point.  Comments please.

"Hi.
I've had something resembling PMR symptoms since Feb this year and have been on Pred since, which has virtually wiped out all the symptoms until now. I was up to 30mg/day for an extended period and am now down to 12mg/day for the last week. My doctor and Rheumatologist have not been convinced that I have only PMR from the start, as I had severe hand stiffness and weakness in both hands and wrists when it was at its worst, as well as the usual legs and hips stiffness/weakness. Not a great deal of pain though with it. All my blood inflammation tests showed very high levels of inflammation. both agreed that the hand issues were not related to PMR and were probably the beginnings of Rheumatoid Arthritis. I had two different blood tests for RA done as well as all the other usual tests like Lupus and Poliomyelitis etc. All were negative. As a consequence I received the rather wooly diagnosis of Polymialgic Rheumatic onset!!! I saw my Rheumatologist last week, who is still convinced I have RA in my hands as 30% of people with RA are negative to the tests. She wants me to drop my Pred 1mg/week to see if I get a flare so that she can see inflammation in my hand joints. She will then do either ultrasound scans or take fluid from the joints in an effort to prove/discount RA! Last night I had a bad flare in my L Hand that was bad enough to wake me up and is swollen and stiff today, with some discomfort. Since reducing to 13mg/day, my hand has been steadily worsening. I am convinced my Rhematologist is trying to pidgeon hole me with RA and I cannot understand why it is not accepted by the medical establishment that hands and feet stiffness/swelling/pain cannot be associated with PMR as well! It would seem to me that the chemicals/hormones in our systems that cause the PMR symptoms are systemic and would therefore be able to affect any area of the body? I would welcome anyone's thoughts on this and is there anyone else out there who suffers with their hands in this way too? Sorry for the long message btw!!!
P.S - I think this is a fantastic forum and wish everyone as speedy a recovery as possible from this awful disease.

"Hi all. Sorry but I haven’t been on the forum for a couple of months due to the ups and downs of life in general. Have been keeping up with the various discussions that have appeared so have not been completely out of it and hope that you are all coping well.
Since my cancer scare earlier in the year I have been one of the lucky ones and have been given the all clear, however my future daughter in law has recently found out that she may have cancer of part of the thyroid and will be having part of it removed this coming week so we all have our fingers crossed for her.
Since my last post on here I have had sun stroke whist away I a caravan, managed to break a root in my tooth that supported a small bridge so am in the middle of dental work, so have had to have the bridge removed along with the broken tooth and will be having a plate to replace it, (the quote for implants was out of this world).
I was also attacked by a cow with a young calf (I live on the New Forest and they, like the ponies are allowed to roam free) and tossed 8 to 10 feet across a gravel track. Sore arms, legs and bruising to my pelvis was the result.
A pred side effect can sometimes be the thinning of the skin which I suffer from, this scrapped a 4 inch by 2 inch gash on my elbow where the skin was thinnest and it has taken 6 weeks to heal over.
The good news for me is that finally I have managed to reduce my pills from 20mg a year ago down to 9.5mg today with very little problems so there is light at the end of the tunnel for me although it may still be a long way off.
Good luck to you all. Dave (tavidu)

"I have needed to be on a split dose of Pred because taking just a morning dose would never last until the next morning.  Splitting has worked great for me.  In late August and most of September I was at 10 mg morning and 5 mg evening.  End of September I got to see my new rheumy (previous one moved) and he wanted me to reduce my pm dose by 1 mg every 2 weeks until he saw me again in late November.  By that schedule I'd be down to 10 mg morning, 1 mg evening.   I wasn't comfortable with the speed of the reduction but thought I'd give it a try for a couple reductions.  
I dropped to 10 mg/4 mg with no problem.  Last week I dropped to 10 mg/3 mg and have had minor to moderate pain issues in all the familiar PMR places since then.  It's not severe and I can deal with it but certainly not ideal.  In 9 more days I'm due to drop to 10/2 and am supposed to be down to 10/1 on November 17th and evidently be ready to drop the evening dose when I see the rheumy again in late November.  He wanted me only reducing the evening dose in the meantime. 
I'm of 3 minds currently:
First, go back up to 10 mg morning and 4 or 5 mg evening and see if things level out again.
Second, kick the evening dose up to 4 or 5 mg and drop the morning dose to 9 or 8.  It seems obvious that the drop to 3 mg evening isn't getting me through until morning.  In my mind it's the total that's taken that matters and whatever split dose works is great regardless if it's morning or evening.
Third thought - after 2 weeks at 10 mg/4 mg I dropped too quick and should sit at that level for a couple more weeks before trying the 10 mg/3 mg split again.
Thoughts?

I am now on 15mgs but tried to drop to 14mgs a couple of days ago but aching round buttocks started ago. My question is that if  stress is a contributory factor in PMR how am I ever going to able to taper as this stress is not going to be alleviated for a long time and I am frightened of the side affects of high dose Pred.

"I thought I'd share some of my experiences with blood sugar because when I first started taking prednisone at 20mg my diet was terrible, and I never got any guidance from my Rheumatologist.  Net result?  I've lost considerable feeling in my feet.  lesson learned:  doctors here are NOT looking out for me.  I have to do that, and so I am.
I went to my GP, and he put me on Metformin to lower my sugar a bit.  Then I set out to learn how to be a good little diabetic, and so I did, reducing my sugar levels from catastrophic to merely dangerous in the long term.  Not being satisfied with that I continued to research diabetes, and I am still learning because eating with a blood sugar problem is part science, and part art.  However, after I got my sugar under some control, I decided to investigate what if anything I could do about prednisone's affect on my blood sugar.  I should point out that I was pre diabetic before taking prednisone, but then with the horrible diet I had, I wasn't shocked when I discovered that I now had medically induced diabetes.
So, after learning to eat better...and I do, I also learned that I can exercise and take up good amounts of excess blood sugar in the muscles, and organs.  It works, but its more complicated than that.  First, at high levels prednisone interferes with the ability of muscles to take in sugar.  I also discovered that when you take prednisone, and I take it at 7:30 AM that it starts to enter your system, and seems to form a bell curve starting to rise very rapidly by noon, and then starting to come down after 6 PM.   If I have any meal at all between noon and six I can be certain of a serious spike in my blood sugar, one that may or may not respond to exercise.
So I had an epiphany:  I wasn't eating 3 meals a day anymore, I was eating 4:  break, lunch, Pred, and dinner.  And prednisone is a loooong meal lasting about 6 hours.  I could eat something as inconspicuous as a banana at 3:30 in the afternoon and it would raise my blood sugar nearly 40 points, whereas if I ate the same banana at 8 PM I'd get a more modest 12-15 point rise.
That led me to a strategy where I've shifted breakfast to an early hour right when I take the pred.  I then get out and walk 30 mins, then 2 hours later I have a light lunch, almost a brunch, because I eat it at 10:30 AM, then follow that with 30 mins of exercise.  That takes me to the no mans land of prednisone which owns me for 6 hours.  What can I eat?  Not much.  I tried sugar free popsicles to satisfy not only my hunger but my sweet tooth.  I struck a disappointment there, because while they are sugar free, they do have sugar alcohols, and testing showed that If I had more than one I was on the sugar eexpress, although roughly half the problem of a banana.  I have discovered that I can have a raw carrot, or celerly, or even some raw broccoli.  If  I cook it however, it becomes, ""bioavailable"" ...translation, it turns into sugar fairly fast.  So I nibble my way through the prednosone no mans land until about 6 ish, when I can go ahead and start dinner.  Dinner allows me more options because the sugar effect of prednisone is really fading fast by then, and not only do I spke less, but it responds to exercise much better.  Bottom line,  I can keep my a1c below 6, and possibly under 5.5 and all without the aforementioned Metformin which I've been off of for awhile.  Getting my a1c below 5 (and I'm taking mg/dl here) is probably not possible on pred, or at least not until the dose is quite low.  When I had to wean off of pred I kept expecting my sugar to come right, but even on lower doses the effect was pronounced.  I hope this rant is useful.  The bottom line now is that I can keep spikes to a bare minimum, and I no longer test as diabetic, even though I have to work quite hard to stay out of that range.  One final note.  As a medically induced type 2 diabetic, some of what I'm suggesting would be of no value to a type 1 since they're dealing with an intrinsic inibility to manufacture enough insulin, as opposed to insulin resistance.  That at least is my best understanding to date.

"I'm so worried about my stomach and muscle wasting with the Prednisone for my PMR.
I've only seen one author write about it, but that was in 1994. I don't see any more recent studies. 
Seems a lot of benefits from it from what she said, but...
I was was excited to read about Betaine for stomach healing, but it says corticoidsteroid users are at high risk, do NOT use. 
I refuse to take PPI's for I hear they make one worse when the acid rebounds. 
I'm so sad the Pred has messed up my stomach. My diet is restricted enough as is. I'm down to 6 mg, but still in pain, but refuse to go up. I'm not sure doctor's care if this messes up my stomach, I wonder if it will heal when all this is done!!!!! Or do they care?

"I am in lots of pain, (all over) with fatigue etc...have had PMR 6 years and cannot get below 10mg without the latter....I have posted on here many times....but my question, (which maybe pointless!) is when I see my doctor on Monday...is there any point in asking her for an adrenal stress blood test.  The reason I ask this, is because I seem to have the symptoms associated with it....but am I on too high a dose?
Thanks for any replies.....

"Hi - have had Ankylosing Spondylitis for 7 years, PMR for 2 years and GCA as well now for 3 months.  Was hospitalized for 2 nights recently with PMR flare and new GCA symptoms - my Rheumo warned me to watch out for severe headaches previously.  Got down to 5mg prednisone since 2 years ago, ER put me on 80mg for the GCA and been tapering down tho still get bad headaches most days tho not as severe, consequently Pred dosage goes up and down according to severity of headaches and pressure in temples, scalp and behind eyes. I'm also on Palexia for pain from Spondylitis and Oxycodone if severe for flares.  Just come out of a massive flare of all three - sometimes the pain gets a bit much and my mood drops but fortunately have a caring husband who is great support.  Most of the time I have been using marihuana oil (which helps a lot) with my rheumo and gp's ok but in Australia it is not legal and where I get it from it costs about $200 every 6-8 weeks - been cutting back on the opiods as I have restrictive breathing issues since critical from pneumonia 5 years ago - opiods were suppressing the part of my brain that controls breathing (diagnosis after many, many tests by respiratory specialist).  It feels like all this will never end. As we are pensioners, the oils continuing expense and legalisation issues have me worried.  Is there light at the end of this huge tunnel for me?Would appreciate advice from PMR patients who also have GCA.  Thankyou.

"I've had PMR for several years, and up until the last year was mostly controlled by prednisone down to 5.  The rheumy added (one at a time ) 4 different meds to try to help me get off pred.  None worked .  A year ago I had to increase my pred. And now I'm up to 27 ( down from 30) and not completely symptom free... some mild girdle area, especially hamstring pain.  But I've developed a new tingling in my calves and feet.  It is worse after playing sports.  Anyone else experience this?  Idea of the cause?  Why suddenly after so many years?  It's very tolerable, but concerns me as it is new.  Thanks for any thoughts on this development.

"I don't feel stressed but there is a stressful situation happening at work and I knew about it coming about 3 weeks ago. I had got down to 12mg but the pain in my shoulders and upper back increased. I went up to 13mg and no change so have jumped back to 15mg yesterday. Not really feeling any different. I was good at 15mg so what do I do? How long do I give it before increasing again? My husband wants me to stop stressing as he is sure this is why the pain is worse. How can you stop when in my head I am fine but do sort of feel that  frustratingly he may be right. He is suggesting that I think about leaving work if this is what it is doing to me but I love what I do. It is not terrible just uncomfortable!

This journey started  3yrs ago pain all over but NOT in my neck and shoulders, about 7weeks ago I started getting pains in my collar bone, neck and shoulder, I was on 3mg. I carried on reducing on the dsns method hoping it would go away but it hasn't. 2 days ago I upped the dose to 5mg but there is no change, should I up my dose a bit more or wait on 5mg a bit longer. I would be grateful for any advice, was doing so well but this disease seems to have a mind of its own.

"I really don't know if this is PMR related but the last two days I have been suffering from joint pain in many joints in my body. I have been taking my pain pills that I take for my back and that hasn't helped to relieve the pain so yesterday I took an extra 5 mg of Prednisone and I got no relief from that either. I sent a message to my doctor yesterday but she never picked up her messages.
Do you think I should try a higher dose of prednisone then the extra 5 I did yesterday? I'm currently on 13 mg of Prednisone and this is my third week of it. So it doesn't really make a lot of sense that it's PMR especially since it didn't respond to the extra 5 mg. Does anyone have any suggestions?

"i have only just been diagnosed and have luckily found this very useful forum. I have lots of questions and hopefully some of you can help me.  after months of excruciating pain - which I thought was my arthritis flare up - I finally found I have polymyalgia rheumatic. I have been so bad I have been crying with the pain.. shoulders, neck and hip mainly..worse in the mornings.. my Gp told me to go do some research and let him know if I want the pred.  I'm still debating that... it is scary when I look at the side effects and the amount of people trying to get off it etc.  I have uncontrolled diabetes and am insulin resistant, the nurses have tried everything and are now out of options. I also have diverticular disease and high blood pressure. my first instinct is to ask for the steroids as I cant live like this any more with this pain, but will I get worse in other departments... diabetes or diverticular problems etc
I know I may not even get any side effects but I usually do from most things and there are a lot of medicines I'm allergic to. my gp has given me an anti inflam drug for now but I just don't know what to do about the steroids... I'm going to a weight loss clinic right now with a view to gastric band to help my other problems... I'm guessing it will be a waste of time on steroids as I will probably gain weight.. I'm confused.. depressed and don't know where to go from here... I just want the pain gone.. please can anyone advise me?  thanks for any input

"Hi fellow sufferers.  Some of you may know this already, but I thought it might be helpful to let you know what I've found out about Prednisolone and Liquorice. 
I've been suffering from the usual dreadful fatigue and other symptoms of both PMR and reducing Prednisolone and I'm now down to 5mg a day and have stabilized at this level.  However a couple of weeks ago, while having an episode of feeing particularly dreadful, I questioned everything about both Prednisolone and PMR and in doing so, I looked into what might be in my diet that could react badly with Pred'.  Bingo! Liquorice!!  Apparantly it's the one most important thing that shouldn't mix with Prednisolone and it makes withdrawal symptoms much worse.
I like herbal and fuit teas and a particular favourite of mine contains liquorice.  As I've all but cut out alcohol, I've tended to drink this tea before going to bed and sometimes during the day.  I haven't drank it now for two weeks and the headaches have subsided.  I feel much less fatigued and fuzzy and generally better in myself.
Hopefully this might just be useful for some of you to know.

"I want to share my notes on how I manage this failed reduction in dose. 
I have PMR almost 2 years now. In mid August I started my taper from 4.0 mg to 3.5mg using DSNS method.  By mid September I have completed the taper, but things were not good. I decided to go back to my previous dose - 4.0 mg. Here is why:
- After a week or so into transition, I  started to feel tired and had less energy then usual.
- In the second week of taper my right knee started hurting and withing few days I had to have a knee brace during my walks.
- About the same time I noticed that my recovery time after biking was much longer .
-Towards the last week of transition, my leg muscles and shoulders were hurting like I had done some heavy lifting, and I can feel muscles ""burning"", usually indicates overworked muscle.
-Last 2 weeks my neck hurt so bad I could not turn my head on one side ( right).
All of these symptoms were telling me that I may be too low (or too early) with my attempt to reduce pred. So I decided to increase the dose...
I took 2 days 5mg and then went back to 4mg. After just 2 days I did not need knee brace any more.  Leg muscle and shoulder pain went away within a week or so... My neck is just becoming normal and it has been almost 2 weeks since I increased the dose.
I just had visit with rheumatologists today and he confirmed that my inflammation was up at 0.5 ( here normal CRP range scale is between 0- 0.3). He agreed with me about the dose.  When I mentioned that I will try to reduce again before next checkup (in 90 days), he suggested that I stay at 4mg.  Am I lucky or not to have understanding rheumatologist who does  not push for senseless reduction in pred?!

"Hi there. I am newly diagnosed ( June 2017) with PMR, having endured deep pains in both thighs for about 2 years. Within approximately 4 days of taking 15m Prednisone, I felt amazing, pain free and full of energy. However, my skin is so fragile it bruises it years at the smallest knock, so have been struggling to lower my steroid dose. I have reached a plateau dose of 7mg, with a bearable resulting amount of discomfort. I am suffering extreme tiredness and hot flushes day and night which are worse than anything the menopause threw at me! I'm irritable, clumsy and feeling rather low. My husband is not unsympathetic, but says I shouldn't try to fight this, that I should just endure this and make the best if it.

"Hello, I am new to forums but could really do with some help coming to terms with PMR. My story so far is that I have been complaining of random pains all over and a feeling in my legs like they are going to cramp up but don't, guess like they are going stiff, tingling or fizzing feeling as well. Lots of pain between my shoulders as well. the doctor did a CRP test which was raised, not sure of the number and it was raised so she then did ESR which has come back today at 37. I have an appointment to discuss the result but she said she thought it would come back raised and said if it did she would diagnose PMR and start me on steroids. I am terrified of taking them. Are the feelings in my legs known by other sufferers? Today my right hand has seized up in terrible pain, is this PMR? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"I saw my Physician today. PMR still active CRP 15 was 25 in July. He wants me to start using Methotrexate 5mgms weekly. I am not happy but will give it a go as it may help my osteoarthritis. I asked him about the Actemra he didn't appear interested in giving it a go but also it is not on the free list here in Australia. I am taking 12.5mgms of Pred. He wants me to take the 12.5mgms for a week then reduce it down to 10mgms. Not going to happen!  I don't see him till February so I will do the slow reduction as per the PMR protocol. I feel a bit ordinary, am over  this PMR. Having a whinge sorry. I don't tolerate the prednisone if I take it in the mornings say 6am. I get a feeling of fullness in my head, I feel breathless, I have been taking it at 1am which seems to suit me better. I know from previous posts that the methotrexate does not help with PMR but I keep having flares on a regular basis and I think I am at the point where  I will try anything.  Open to any suggestions. Thanks Kath.

"The example given for my title is exactly what I would have called this question!  I am down to 10mg of prednisolone after being diagnosed with PMR just 5 months ago.  BUT I have started to feel depressed over the last two weeks.  I have had a death in the family which has hit me quite hard particularly as I live in Tasmania and can't get over for the funeral in England - the tyranny of distance!  I know that depression is common on pred - my brother who lives in Wales also has PMR and has been experiencing horrible depression.  What do people recommend I really don't want to take more drugs?
Also has anyone experienced this - I feel I have had a very mild form of PMR for YEARS?  Symptoms would flare with aches, pains,stiffness, low energy, mild headache and sore throat, last for some weeks and then disappear again.  I used to think ""Oh I've got that mild virus again"" and it would eventually go away.   Then, five months ago I got the full blown thing went to the doctor, got diagnosed and have been on pred ever since.

"My frozen shoulder turned out to be part of PMR, went to GP who sent me for a X-ray as my left shoulder down to my elbow was so stiff I could not lift it and very painful. He has suggested I go back to 20mg as stiffness has returned to my hips and backs of my legs.
As I am away on a sailing boat cruise he felt trying to get off the boat into a tender would not work if I am in this much pain. 
I thought I was doing so well then it comes,and bites you on the butt.  His advice was to stay on 20mg for the next three weeks then reduce to 15mg, before my appt with the Rhmy on 17 October. 
I know some of you have also thought everything was looking good and reduced to a reduced amount of Pred and then our friend PMR comes back.

"Had an interesting 1st appointment with my new rheumy today.  My actual time spent with him for exam and discussion was 75 minutes!  I don't think I've spent that much time with a doctor in a years time!  I saw my original rheumy 4 times over 7 months and don't think I spent a total of 30 minutes with him.  This rural hospital/clinic had 3 rheumies when I went for my 1st appointment last year.  Now he is the only one and he will be retiring sometime next year at age 71.  They have a new rheumy starting the 1st of the year but I'm wondering if I should be looking for a different clinic with better staff stability.
Got the full exam by him and wanted the whole medical story how and why I'm being treated for PMR.  When I got to the point of mentioning that my fingers and toes got very swollen during my 2nd flare he seemed to fixate on that and said that it was more likely that I had Rheumatoid Arthritis as symptoms were similar to PMR.  I said the joints in hands and feet were swollen for a while but never painful and his answer was well, that can happen sometimes with RA.  I like to think I'm open minded and even today did try, but he seemed to really be bent on proving that the original diagnosis was wrong and I had Rheumatoid Arthritis instead, even to the point of saying that hopefully I'd have a flare up and to contact him so he could examine me without the prednisone having kept the pain and swelling down!  Also wanted to take fluid from both my knees so he could look for crystals that would support the idea of RA.  I told him to forget that one.  I could go on and on, but the best I can say is that it was a rather surreal experience.  I do think he's extremely smart but he probably should be after 43 years in the profession.  I know rheumatoid arthritis could be a possibility but I'd think I would have been screaming from joint pain and swelling.  I've had some but it's been the shoulders, biceps and thighs that have been the biggest sources of the crippling pain.
I think I know what I'm going to do but I'll ask everyone's opinion on his reduction schedule anyway.  I'm at 15 mg of pred currently (10 mg @ 6 am, 5 mg @ 6 pm).  It didn't take me much to convince him that I should drop 1 mg at a time.  At first he said 2.5 mg.  He wants me dropping 1 mg every 2 weeks.  Seems pretty fast to me.  Thoughts?? I was thinking more like double the length - 4 weeks.  I got the prescription for the 1 mg tabs - that's the main thing.  I suppose I could try dropping to 14 and to 13 in 2 week increments but I'm very leery about going that quickly when I get close to 10 mg.  One more thing - he wants me dropping the 1 mg each time from my evening dose, so my split dose would go 10/4, 10/3, 10/2, 10/1 and down to just 10 mg in the morning 5 days before my next appointment in late November.  I tried to explain that taking just morning dose didn't work for me but he just blew me off.  What do you think - alternate the reduction between morning and evening?  Right now I'm trusting the opinions here wayyyy more.  
Sorry to be long winded again.  Can't seem to help myself!  I do really appreciate this site and everyone's comments.

"Hi Everyone!
Just a quick one to let you know it's possible to join the Zero Club - albeit with help of Tocilizumab (Actemra).
I can't tell you how much better I feel off the pred - right down to the last .5mg I still had side effects such as an increased appetite, brain fog, lethargy, etc.
It took nearly a year to get off pred after starting Actemra, but well worth it. Two weeks after my last dose I feel like I have my life back, even though I still have PMR. I'm still a bit stiff, but I have no pain. I have more energy. I eat half what I used to and I am no longer drinking too much because I'm depressed. Pred has a lot to answer for!
I'm injecting Actemra weekly, but the rheumy has mentioned going off it as well early next year - which will be the real test to see if PMR comes screaming back. I've told him I'm not keen to experiment!

"Sometimes I think I'm my own worst enemy.  I've been doing pretty well in recent months, only having to deal with a few relatively minor issues.  I take Prednisone doses at 6 am and 6 pm each day, usually +/- an hour or so.  Have some Prednisone side effects to deal with but that's really just part of dealing with PMR.  
Yesterday evening I finished a long day at work and was pretty fatigued.   We had dinner about 7 pm and afterwards I relaxed in the recliner watching TV.   I did my very common routine of falling asleep about 9:30 and woke up about  3:00 am.  What was different was waking up with sore shoulders and thighs.  I first thought that maybe it was from work but then started wondering about the Prednisone.  Did I take it at dinner at 7:00 pm?  I must have - I never miss taking the Prednisone!  That can't be it.  Or could it?  Did I take it?  I struggle out of the recliner and go check the pill box.  Darn, I didn't take it!!!  I immediately took the Pred dose but knew I was going to pay for being 8 hours late taking it.  And I was right.
By 4:30 I was as crippled as badly as I've ever been since having PMR, barely able to get out of the chair and only able to take 1 step at a time on the staircase.  Was feeling very miserable.  Even laying in bed was too painful.  At 6:00 I took my next dose of Pred and by 8:00 am the pain and other issues were retreating.  By 10:00 I was feeling very well again but worn out of course.  I worked from 10:00 to the end of the day but kept myself to desk work as that was the most I could handle.
I'd like to say this is the first time I've done it to myself but I did the same thing about 3 and 6 months ago.  I think the evening dose is the hard one sometimes when you're busy into the evening and more so because I've never had to take pills in the evening before now.  My only question is if the pain, swelling, etc is from a quick, short flaring of the PMR or is it the adrenals?  I have a hard time thinking it'd be the adrenal glands after only 8 hours missing a Pred dose.
Just feeling a bit dumb about this self-inflicted pain episode.  Thanks for letting me vent here.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in December last and after doing a bit of research decided that I would reduce my intake of carbs as I felt this might help reduce the inflammation. Being a life-long serious cyclist I've found this fairly counter-intuitive as it's always been 'carbs, carbs, carbs!' but nevertheless I persevered and after reading a fair bit I've come to feel that this is definitely the way to go and would definitely follow a low-carb, high-fat lifestyle even if I wasn't sick. I don't know if it helps with the inflammation but I definitely have more energy when I'm strict with myself. In fact more and more professional athletes (particularly endurance athletes) are going LCHF so if it's good enough for them it's good enough for me...
I'm now considering going full-on Keto but one of the things that's recommended is to take additional salt, whereas because of the Prednisone I've been told to cut out salt. Does anyone else here follow a Keto diet (for example I've read that you're very low-carb Eileen) and if so do you take extra salt? In fact why is it recommended that we don't add salt? I was under the impression it was to prevent water retention and weight gain; is that correct?
Thanks in advance.

I would be grateful for advice on the relationship, if any, between the onset of fatigue and reduction in predistone dose. Starting on 15mg I am down to 9mg with no flare ups but I am just beginning to feel short lived bouts of fatigue . I am due to go down to 8mg and have an appointment with my doctor on Friday. Do you know if I go ahead with reduction will fatigue increase or will it even out if I stay on 9mg for a little longer. Or is it just best to try lower dose and see what happens? This is a baffling and tedious journey but ""I am here to tell the tale"" which is always my own way of reminding myself that I have an enormous amount for which to be grateful.
Thank you all again and my heartfelt wishes for recovery for those of you who are having a bad time.

"I was diagnosed with GCA in Sep2016. Got 60mg Pred, reduced to 25mg in Dec2017. First flare-up. Back to 60mg, using DSNS method down to 17,5/15mg. Second flare up. Back up to 20mg, not enough, 30mg, still stiff in morning and paniful hands and feet. Tomorrow I will start going back to 40mg. Hopefully that is enough to suppress symptoms and then start going down again. I have had no significant side effects even when I was on 60mg. I sleep well, have gained almost no weight. A little rounder cheeks, but I don't think that anyone else actually notices. I believe that I should be able to get back down to the 20mg relatively quickly and then back to patiently using DSNS to get down lower.
My Rheum wants to try Actemra. Who has experience with this and who would you recommend it for me?

"Hi All
I'm down to 12mg and up until a few weeks ago was feeling ok but am feeling now as if I am running on empty. Is this because of PMR or the reduction of pred? I have beginnings of muscle ache in my upper back and can feel soreness in my neck. It is not bad at the moment but it is there. Do I stick on 12mg and hope if settles down or continue with the slow reduction to 11mg because this is just how I am going to feel as I reduce? 
I feel a fraud because I am not as bad as some on here. I am working and do not feel I have to stop and rest during the day but just feel tired all the time. I also feel that it would make no difference if I went to the gym or not. My body seems to be saying no, my head says keep going. Sorry just needed to get that off my chest!

"I have read up here and downloaded the paper from Bristol University.
I think my Gp suspects PMR as my pain is consistent with it (hips and groins, arms and neck). I live on paracetamol right now as I have a blood condition (low platelets) that does not permit me to have anti inflammatory drugs.
My ESR's are high and also my white cells. My GP has referred me back to my haematologist to check out the raised white cells.
If I use cold compresses and freeze my back and neck it eases, also acupuncture has helped a lot with the pain. However, I am guessing I will have to take a steroid.
I did have sever jaw pain a week ago for 3 nights - but its gone. I did think it was a toothache and am still not sure as it only lasted 1 hour each night and as said, has completely gone this week. I am guessing that if it was the Giant cell thingy, it would not go like that. Anyone else have that pain any time but its been part of the PMR rather than the other, more serous problem? best wishes, Jen

"I have recently purchased my annual travel insurance policy (we travel several times a year).  Ever since I have been on prednisone for my PMR - 5 years now - I have purchased this directly from the company. There is a question on the health questionnaire about a new prescription and/or s change in dose and I have always answered Yes as my dose is changing of course. The insurance company people have never asked me what drug I take. 
So this month the company is have labour issues and if you want their policy you need to contact an independent insurance company who sells their policy, often called insurance brokers here.
So I contacted a local insurance company and talked to a guy who seems very knowledgeable about insurance companies. I was shocked to learn that I basically have had no travel insurance coverage since I have been on prednisone! I was told that insurance companies use the excuse of prednisone to not pay claims as prednisone has so many side effects, like anything to do with your heart.  He said one very large insurance company in Canada refuses to give you a travel insurance policy if you are on prednisone.  He said being on prednisone is a really big deal if you are buying travel insurance. 
I feel so lucky to have talked to this insurance broker. The solution is to purchase my usual travel policy (and he said the company is good) but to also purchase additional coverage (only cost $100) for pre-existing conditions which basically removes prednisone from my medical questionnaire. 
I am posting this in case some of you were not aware that you could have a travel insurance issue with prednisone.

"I saw my rheumatologist today she likes to see me once every 3 months and she always checks at least my inflammation markers. It's been a year this month since I've been diagnosed with PMR. And I started at 20 mg and I have gotten down to 10 briefly and I am now back up to 14 mg. I am very frustrated with my body and my rheumatologist is starting to think that this is not PMR. For two years before my diagnosis I had an elevated sed rate and I ran a low-grade fever in the mornings. My GP assumed it was because of my bad back so we did not act on it. But then when I came to him a year ago complaining of body pain and not feeling well he found that not only with my sed rate elevated it's so as my CPR. So he cucluded from that that I had PMR. It took 2 months to get in to see a rheumatologist and during that two months my body alternated berween aches and pains and the general feeling sickly to feeling normal. But I never had the pain in the shoulders or upper arms for the upper back. My pain was predominantly my upper legs. And of course my back hurt but it hurt anyway so it's hard to say if PMR was affecting my lower back. So based on everything I told my rheumatologist she puts me on 20 mg of prednisone and explain to me how to taper down. Over this past year I've learned so much from this group as well as other groups that I belong to and so when her tapering schedule was not working for me I asked her if I could do it my way and she said yes. Well my way was half of a milligram every two weeks. Doing it that way I was able to get down to 10 mg very briefly and then I got sick and spent four days in the hospital in May. Since they thought my breathing problems were allergy-related they bumped my prednisone up as high as 50 mg so when I got out of the hospital I really didn't know what to start on and the rheumatologist suggested I start at 15. (I went from 50 for 3 days then 30 for 3 days then 15). That was in May, now its September and I'm on 14 mg. I was at 13 and a half was due to go to 13 and I couldn't do it. I have horrible pains in my hands and it sometimes go up to my elbows and sometimes I have horrible pains in my lower legs from the knees down. Well just today I learned that a new MRI that I had done indicates that there's good reason to think that the pain in my legs is sciatica and not related to the PMR. Which leaves my hands and lower back that hurt. I know that I have OA in my thumbs and my neck and I know that I do not have carpal tunnel because I've been tested. So I'm feeling pretty confident that my hand pain is due to PMR. And when I taper down to low my body responds and my hands start hurting and then I start getting an all-over sickly feeling kind of like having the flu. After visiting with my rheumatologist today she wants me to try Gabapentin. I've already tried methotrexate and since my liver enzymes were up quite high for a long while I can't take it any more. I also am not able to take Ibuprofen. She wants me on something that would help inflammation thinking that might help me get my prednisone lower. But she's offered me Gabapentin twice and the first time I said noway because I know it can affect your memory. But this time I said I would try it and if it doesn't work I'm going to try Logic which will help reduce the inflammation.
I'm really sorry this is so long but I wanted you to know what's been going on with me. I am to the point where I am so tired of the pain in my body and I am so fatigued I have not got the energy to walk to the bathroom and back without collapsing on the couch afterwards. And yet maybe this is not even PMR. And if it is PMR why the hell can I not get my prednisone tapered any lower. Someone please tell me something that will make me feel better.

"Can anyone recommend a rheumatologist in the UK? I am looking for someone either around London or the south. I live in Guernsey and rheumy's are few and far between here. I have been seeing someone in Southampton but I don't feel I am getting what I need and want to try a second opinion. 
When people see a rheumatologist do they have a plan to see them again? It all feels a little wishy washy to me. He does not agree with Dr. diagnosis of PMR but can't confirm his AS suggestion without another MRI scan but there is no plan to do another one. Am I supposed to chase this up or should it be more structured than this? Your advice is always appreciated.

"I was diagnosed on April last year with Polymylgia. In August diagnosed with Temporal Artritis. Last saw my rheumathologist in Dec 16, was due to see him in March, but got appointment mixed up and have been moved to the bottom of a long waiting list as a result, so have basically been treating myself as my doc won't make a decision. Another rhumy was recommended to me so had an appointment with him on Friday. He has said that in his opinion I don't have Polymylgia or Temporal artritis, feels all my pain is from Fibromylgia (which I've had for approx 15 years) after squeezing my arms legs, shoulders and hips mercilessly, leaving me in tears. Told him what led to my diagnosis, 10mgs prednisone initially and 60mgs in August down to 6.5 now. 2 wks in on 60mg had a massive breakthrough headache on right side of head (TA side) which I was hospitalised for a week with, which he was surprised Id been hospitalised and felt it was a migraine. Told him as best i could all the symptoms which lead to both diagnosis and the 'miraculous' recovery once started the pred to which he said, well pred damps down everything in the body! Explained my diagnosis for TA which at the time felt the side of my head had been hit repeatedly with a baseball bat, said the pain could have been referred from my shoulder! Showed him my blood tests back to April 16. My ESR never went above 30 and CRP above 6, (although when they were 'high' for me was when I couldn't turn in bed and in so much pain) Queried this with him & he said can happen in rare cases! Told me he wanted me off pred as soon as possible and to reduce by 1mg every 2 wks, I queried the speed of this, he said it'd be fine, I didn't agree but he didn't acknowledge it.  Prescribed Cymbalta, said it would improve my sleep and reduce the pain. I am to lose weight (I'm heavy), and to exercise! Noy making excuses but lred hasnt been kind to me with weight and fatigue from Fibro limits ability to exercise. In the meantime I've researched Cymbalta and have decided I'm not going to go on it as people's reactions to being on it and withdrawal are herrendous, plus it puts on weight! I feel I'm caught between a rock and a hard place, don't know whether to believe him about Poly and TA and when I queried about his opinion, he said well I wasn't there!! ! I have left a message with his sec so expecting (I hope) a phone call tmrw when I'll tell him that I won't take Cymbalta. I'm so upset by all if this and very scared. Could I have your thoughts on what I should do! Thank you in advance!

"i got pmr in September 2016, started on 20 mg pred.  Got down to 4 1/2 mg. in August, but felt terrible, went back up to 6 mg., but then had bone crushing fatigue and depression, so at the advice of folks here, I went up to 7 mg.  that was 2 weeks ago.  I still feel exhausted most of the time...do dishes, sit down. Make bed, sit down. one load of laundry, sit down.  The soreness and stiffness is ever-present, especially in the mornings; it never goes away completely,  it's not a flare, nothing even close to the original pain, just an ever present reminder that the pmr is there.  Just had blood levels tested 2 weeks ago: perfect.  The bone crushing fatigue--where you can barely move--is better but now I'm just plain exhausted.  I can walk around the block a couple times a day, but that's it.  Here are my questions:  1) is what I am experiencing anywhere near to be expected as part of the pmr illness?  Do others experience this?  2) my body hates pred.  Since I've returned back up to 7 mg., I'm constipated, not sleeping well, hair falling out again, etc.  just thought I would mention this--I can tell that the side effects are returning.  So certainly I am loathe to increase it even more...I just want to know if what I am describing is to be expected as part and parcel of the illness.  To be honest, I just dont remember what I felt like at 7 mg. the first time around....thanks so much.

"Hi I have had PMR and GCA for a total of two years. I was on 60mg of Pred and tapered off completely by July 2017. I had 2 great months.  Now in September I have had a very bad bout of Diverticulitis and feel as though my PMR is returning. I have terrible groin pain and hip and back pain. My blood results have risen again but I don't yet know if this is because of the Diverticulitis or if the dreaded PMR is returning! I'm 62. This all started just before my 60th birthday.
has anyone else experienced this type of thing? Can another infection start PMR off again? And..
if so what has helped you? 
Also, my diverticulitis isn't just pain on my left side it turns into total abdominal pain. Pain before the toilet, during and after. Pain coughing, laughing (I wish) sitting down etc. does anyone else get this? I'd love to hear if anyone else thinks they may be linked.

"Hi after many years of pain, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia few years ago, however nothing helped, I was referred back to the rhemo who did bloods and my CRP levels was very very high, he gave me pred and I returned after two weeks and he said it must be PMR as the CRP levels had come down with the second blood test taking the pred. he advised to start on 18mg and reduce down over a period of time. My GP wasn't happy for me to start them as he said it interfers with the diabetic and I have also had a heart bypass in December 2016,  
I have stopped taking the pred as I have gained almost a stone in weight even though I watch my diet very closely because of the diabetice and heart problems, so I have the pains all back again, also very bad back pain that is affecting the back of my legs and they feel weak.
Do people suffer with this back pain with PMR or is it Fibro, I have had a MRI that I am awaiting results of. Also have hit the funny age so going though night sweats and not sleeping. I am a bit at the end of my tether with it all, I am also trying to work and just don't know how to cope with it all, my question is is there any thing else then pred that any one can recommend.
Thanks and sorry for the long story xx

"I've been on prednisone for almost 11 months for PMR, had a few painful flares along the way, and so far have never gotten below 15 mg.  Over the last 2 months I've really felt pretty good and have been at 15 mg for the last 4 weeks with only the pred side effects to deal with.  I've worked full weeks at the job both in office and the physical demands - no problem.  I've even had a lot of stress from work and home (family issues, father-in-law death, etc) and have sailed along great - until late last week.  Past flares have always been very painful, forcing me to increase the prednisone dose.  Currently I'm having a little pain these recent days, but am experiencing a LOT of fatigue.  I haven't run into fatigue at this level before and am wondering if this is another flare but in a different style?  I spent the last 4 days doing virtually no physical activity and lots of sleeping but could just as easily go back to bed right now instead of being at my job.  Much as I hate to consider it, maybe I need to dial back my work load?  I abhor the idea of that, especially when I've sailed along so smoothly for so long, but just maybe I'm being my own worst enemy?  Thoughts and opinions sought.  FYI, previous flares (except one) happened when I would come down with a cold.  One coincided with a reduction from 15 to 12.5 mg.  I know, toooooo fast a reduction.  That was an early lesson learned.

"I wrote about a month ago, but couldn't find the post.  I'm about to ""celebrate"" 3 ys. of PMR.  Back in July I had gotten to the transition between 2.5 and 2.0 mg. Medrol in the AM with 0.5 mg at night.  CRP and Sed rates were much higher than they had been so I went back to 3.0 mg in the AM for over 3 wks, and then to 3.5 mg. AM at Rheum's suggestion.  After a week of that I forgot the PM dose so I took 4.0 mg Medrol in the AM and have now been on that dose (all in the AM) for 2.5 weeks.  CRP/Sed are really about the same as they were in July, when I was between 2.5 and 2.0 mg.  I can't say that I feel much better or worse thru any of this, but I'm even more discouraged if that's possible.  Thanks for listening

"Has anyone here tried to supplement the Pred with diet? I'm OK taking meds, but I'd rather not, if there is an option. So I went to a naturopath, who put me on a rather restrictive diet--the aim is to take as little Pred as possible. So, I can't have sugars, dairy, legumes and lentils, nuts and seeds, grains or flours of any kind as well as no nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes). So I can have other veggies, meats, eggs and 2 servings of fruits. Right now I'm on 9-10 mg (alternating days) of Prednisone. At the best of times, I have to work at maintaining my weight--so this will make it much harder. He told me to try it for 2 weeks, and then see how things are.

PMR diagnosed 6 months. All pain from waist down returned, including muscle twitching & tingling. Neck, shoulders etc all fine.
My inflammation is back to a very normal 12 ESR & 5 CRP.
I can't walk or stand for 30 mins without severe pain & needing the loo. I get out of bed fine, my pain starts when I'm on my feet.
I've been back to doctors several times asking for referral & further investigation. Doctors can't refer as PMR is dealt within surgery, here in the South East.
Given me HRT as hormone levels show I'm menopausal & the hot flushes have been coming in droves. I'm 48.
They say alot of other my symptoms & the fact I feel a complete wreck are both PMR & menopause.
If this is the case I will accept that & realise there's a long road!
My other option is to keep on at them like a hypochondriac!

Im just wondering if dizziness is associated with PMR? But it's only when I turn my head if Im laying down and when I get up in the mornings. My doctor says it's vertigo and gave me a pile of tablets to take, but to be honest I want to know what's causing the dizziness and not just mask it, doctor cant give me any answers! So I'm wondering if anyone has had it with PMR and how long does it last, I've been suffering with it for about 3 weeks! 
Im on 2mg of prednisolone.
many thanks

"For all you ""pro's"" out there.  When I started on prednisone over 3 years ago I was sent for eye exams every 3 months. May have been excessive, but it gave me some ease. About a year later it changed to every six months.Last October it changed again to annual.  I'm currently at 10.5 mg and going for my annual eye exam this morning. It's earlier than scheduled, but I will be out of the country in October.
I have never had any eye issues apart from the usual dryness at the higher dosages and fluctuation in prescription strength.  I resisted getting new lens for three years, but recently caved and now have great lens. Hopefully things have settled down in that regard.
My question: Is there a general protocol for the frequency of regular eye exams when on prednisone?

"Hi, was diagnosed in November past with PMR but was undiagnosed for approx 6 months.  All my pain and stiffness was from neck down to knees.  I have never had problems below my knees.  When I go for a short drive to do some grocery shopping it's really not a problem (my son comes with me so that he can pack and put away my groceries).
Two weeks in a row I have walked to my slimming club which is 5 mins away but after a short while my calf muscles start to ache, the left more than the right.  I have to hold on to my son for support.  Before PMR and on a good day I could walk 4 miles.  Never in my life have I had a problem with calf muscles.  If it's not bad enough having PMR, now I cannot go out for a short walk without real discomfort.  Thank you in advance for any replies.  Also I have lost 1lb in weight in 7 weeks even on a very low carb diet.  So am not going back to slimming club, am just fed up with everything at present, but it will pass, when I don't know, but sure I'm not going anywhere.

"Has anybody tried this treatment for PMR?
After reading the side effects, I am very hesitant following her advise. 
I am taking Plaquenil for Palindromic Rheumatism , and I am doing well with the medication.  My concern is dealing with the bilateral discomfort and fatigue caused by PMR which I have had for 2 1/2 years.  She thinks that PMR should be gone after 2 years,  and to this day, my rheumy does not think that I have the problem. She says that I have arthritis.  I do have osteo-arthritis which is fairly common when one is 77 years old.
She said that prednisone will ""kill me"".  I am taking 8 mg and trying to reduce very slowly. 
Gentle Yoga stretching classes have helped me with mobility in my lower back and walking is fairly easy.
I took note and read the new findings by the Mayo Clinic about prednisone on this  website.  I will need to call her attention to it.
It is not easy dealing with a rheumy who goes by the book.  My GP suggested to get a second opinion by a different rheumatologist, but I have not heard if the referral is possible. I am in the US.
Thank you for your input.

"Put the whole of the above in your search engine or if you cannot find it, send me a PM and I will send you the link.
Everyone should read this paper especially newly diagnosed patients. It might help to take some of the fear away from suddenly being prescribed with prednisolone, which is essential.
This research paper (issued 18 August) by Practical Pain Management and the research was led by Eric L Matteson MD,MPH and Don L Goldenburg MD. 
Would be interested in your comments.

"I will be 79 in August.  I was diagnosed with PMR January 2016 and given 15 mgs prednisone.  I have been on 6 mgs since February 2017. Before February I had attempted going to 5 mgs two times but had a flare each time.  I am considering the DSNS method but cannot find the description of how it works.
Two months ago, late April,  I had  right knee replacement. Unfortunately, I was given blood thinner Xarelto after surgery which caused vomiting blood, a blood transfusion, and discovery of old  ulcers I did not know I had.  Both legs were swollen and the repaired leg was black and blue for weeks.  The repaired leg still has some swelling.  I am currently getting physical therapy to straighten knee and given 150 mgs Ranitidine for the ulcers.  I am also being treated for dry eye.
Last week I had swelling and soreness mid-chest above my breasts and it hurt to cough.  At the same time, a muscle affecting my left hip causes pain when arising from bed.  It gradually goes away during the day.  The chest swelling is still there but does not hurt.
Today, I took 5 ½ mgs pred, hoping that this will be the beginning of the DSNS method for me.  My GP is aware and seems to agree with whatever I do re PMR.  I would appreciate your comments.

"Hello all!
I am 56 - female and self employed.
Until 3 weeks ago I was schooling and training up to 3 horses per day, competing and looking after my own 4 horses. Mucking out, sweeping, lifting!!
After a few months of increasing shooting pains in my arms , and limited movement ( doctor thought it was rotator cuff and I was waiting to see a physio.) Pain killers didn't relive the pains at all. Suddenly I could hardly move for the pain.
Pain in leg from thigh to knee too.
PMR diagnosed by a ESR of 44 ( not too high he said?)
Started on 15mg steroid daily. - Some improvement but not a lot
Increased 5 days later to 30mg daily.
Today is day 6 on this dose. At first things got worse but I was still trying to do 2hours of instruction outside ( can't even hold a horse at the moment!) and a little mucking out and sweeping as well as driving a little.
Doctor told me to rest and the pains are getting better.
But I still have such limited movement in arms. Dressing is still very, very hard. Can't reach or move the arms quickly for fear of stabbing pains.
Feel as if I am shaking inside and so weak - as if I've had the flu.
Back for blood test Monday.
Is this a kind of normal tale??
Is there anyone out there who is back in the saddle? And how long will it take before things get so I can work and ride again please???
And how much does everyone else rest please??
Thank you.

Couldn't get doc app but practice nurse decided eye was spontaneous bleed.i had mentioned the pmr to her.  Started to get anxious about risk of GCA so saw doctor later in week who thought it was  just pmr , suggested raising dose to 10mg . Did that , still vague aches but eye seemed ok until last day or so . Feels sore, bit headachy . Possibly becoming neurotic. Does my jaw hurt , are my teeth aching , or are these head feelings just tension with a little bit of knowledge turning me into a head case? Have not had any visual disturbances or severe headaches . Thought I might get an appointment at my optician for an eye check tomorrow ,  easier to get an appointment for a start . Anybody had similar experiences ?

"I am 70.  Experiencing weakness arms, thighs, increasing fatigue over two years before finally being diagnosed in March 2017.   Was on and off prednisone every two to three months, as GP kept saying it was not good to stay on.   Each time it was stopped I was back in bed within a day or two.  Finally saw a ruematologist and diagnosed in March.   Started on 20mg Prednisone,  and told to decrease every few weeks till 5mg.  It is very difficult to decrease it without fatigue and pain returning.   Have had to go back to 20 and am now decreasing by 1/4 mg. every four weeks.   this week stated on 13 3/4mg.  However I am experiencing pain in my shoulders and left arm, and increased fatigue.   The pain I can deal with but the fatigue is really hard.  I have always been quite active,  plus my husband and I have been and still are raising our grandson since he was 4, now 13.  My question has anyone stayed on 20 mg for a long time say months,   I am reluctant to do this because of possible side effects.  I cannot take Fosomax or the other med for prevention of loss of bone density because of side effects.  I would just like to have a few months of feeling able to function at a near normal leval.   I would really appreciate hearing from anyone who is on 20 for any length of time.   Thanks

"Hi, everybody!
I haven't been on this discussion forum for quite awhile. I was diagnosed with PMR a year ago, Aug 2016, and put on increasing doses of Prednisone until I reached 40mg. Exactly the wrong way to handle it, but it took awhile to get diagnosed. Shoulder pain stayed away until down to 20 mg. Rheumy extremely anxious to get me off prednisone, so now am down to 8mg on the slow method. In April I fell in a deep hole and blew disc L3.  I've been in such pain trying to get out of bed in the morning and just get to the toilet, my shoulders are nothing on comparison, but still hurt. I have been put on Gabapentin (Lyrica) 300 mg 3x day and hydrocodone (norco) when needed, usually 1/2 pill in morning. I remembered someone on this list or the prednisone list mentioning splitting her dosage to help with morning stiffness, so I tried it, 5mg in morning 2mg at  bedtime. I was afraid it would keep me up, but I also take Trazodone for sleep and it didn't seem to bother me. I got up at least 60% better. I could move out of the bed and walk to toilet and sit down without excruciating pain. I thought I could tell the difference on my back pain (and butt and leg) and PMR pain. It seems I can not. I am waiting to have surgery on my back..not until latter half of November, but, am wondering, now, how much pain is PMR and how much back pain. Has anyone split their dosage and found relief the next morning? How much relief? Has anyone needed back surgery while trying to get off Prednisone? Help?!!

"To make a long story short I went away for the weekend and walked 22,000-26,000 steps per day.  I returned and the next morning when I woke up it was very painful to walk. I have extensor tendonitis in both feet anyway but this was different and in a different area.  One of you lovely experts suggested I had a spontaneous metatarsal fracture. I waited a week and then went to A&E.  The doctor told me to get an xray which I did.  The x ray did not show a break but she said sometimes they don't show up for 3 weeks.  Well it has been over 4 weeks and the foot is still painful (esp coming down steps).  I guess it will be painful for while and even if it was broken what would they do for me?  Of course I do not want foot problems for the rest of my life (I need my feet) but what should I do.  I do wiggle them around and wear good trainers.  I am wondering as I am back to work on Monday (after summer off - I work in 2 schools) and my new office is up six flights of stairs (and I go up and down a lot in the day).  I love getting my steps in but I do not want to make a problem worse.  
Do I just ice it and rest my foot at the end of the day and do some wiggling exercises or do I go back to A&E to have them re x ray the foot?  (or am I being a pain in the ...). 
Thanks for all the great responses I know I will get.
Happy weekend.

"Have had PMR in my shoulders/neck for 4 years.  Rheumy suggested I just stay at 7.5 since I've flared twice even at this level pred.
A few weeks back I stopped plaqeunil and methotrexate.
5 days ago I woke up in bad pain in my left hip/thigh and I sort of recognize the pain as PMR.  Only last night was I able to put full weight on it for a blip of time.
How can it have moved to my leg after 4 years?!  Needless to say I'm distressed.  Could it be something else?
Now I'm fearful it will move to my other leg and I won't be able to walk at all.
I ordered a cane yesterday on amazon and have upped my pred dose to 20.
Thoughts?
How do those with hip PMR walk?  
It is better than day one, so maybe it will continue to improve.

I am on 12mg/13mg reduction and can get to 10 days if I do not take my next 13mg in 5 days time. What do I do? Take 12mg every day forgetting the next 13mg day and on the day of the DR appointment take 10mg and the other 2 later in the day. Will this make that much difference or do I need to phone and ask if she will prescribe it before my appointment.

"I am 67 years old. I was diagnosed with PMR 2 years ago. For the past few months my health has been changing/deteriorating again. I know something is happening but I do not know what. In the past couple of days I have had a few eye incidents - my first thoughts of course are GCA. I had several incidents of pain in a line vertical thru each eye (at different times). It was extreme pain, the extreme part did not last long, but it did take a while to return to normal. It has mainly happened at night and has woken me up. Last night my eyesight went very strange for about an hour - like water designs on glass. My entire head was aching in a way it has never done before. Today my head is still 'thick', my scalp/neck is tender in many places, my shoulders sore. I have had severe head sweats for about 3 months - like I did have before PMR diagnosis.
?At first I thought I was having a flare, then I blamed wet winter weather, but over the weekend the new eye incidents have scared me. I have a Dr's appointment tomorrow. My Dr is really lovely, but very casual about the whole situation, so just wondering what other people have experienced.

"My assumption has always been that if I go into remission it means that I can get off pred completely, and all the pain will be gone...and thanks for playing.
However, as I've been reducing I've gotten some serious pain in my shoulders when I move them in a stretching position, or even try and sleep on my sides.  My nurse practitioner suggested this was separate from the PMR and possibly some form of arthritis.  My Rheumy the other day however suggests that the shoulder pain is PMR not taken care of at my current dose (5mg).  He bases this in part on the fact that while on vacation in South Africa I went to an excellent doctor there (who is more reasonable fee-wise than doctors here where I'm insured).  That doctor gave me a combo steroid/anti-inflamatory shot in the bum.  That night I felt like a million bucks, and continued to feel that way for at least a week.  Shoulder pain?  Gone.  In fact, my shoulders never have quite returned to the frozen pain I had.  They're still a bit better.  My Rheumy also suggests that I could go into remission and still have that pain in my shoulders forever.
However,  I don't think he's that good, so I don't over-value his opinion.  So, even if he's right I value the opinions in this group more.  This group has been much more helpful than him.  This is the guy that never even bothered to check my blood sugar after putting me on a high dose of pred.  I had to find out from my GP.  BTW,  I showed him the DSNS schedule.  He approved of it, but has never showed any interest in it otherwise, and indeed gave me a schedule calculated to make me withdrawal and flare  so...I'm pretty much on my own without you guys.  So, what say you?  Have I mis-set my expectations with respect to remission...assuming I get there?

Since I already have lower back pain from another condition I didn't give it much thought other than to treat with ice. But I woke up at 12:30 at night and my hands arms ankles and feet hurt so bad that I realized I'm in a flare. A flare is no surprise since I am waiting on test results from my tongue biopsy I had two weeks ago. So I have been stressing a lot about whether I have oral cancer or not. Anyway and about 2:30 I took 2 mg of prednisone. The relief has been minimal st best. I usually will respond fairly quickly to a dosage. So my question is: Should I up it more than the 2 mg or should I try that dosage again with my next round and see what happens?

"I have been wondering....  I had bilateral temporal artery biopsies a few weeks ago, which were negative.  My St. Louis doctor still thinks that I have GCA.  I am currently at the Mayo clinic in Minnesota getting a second opinion.   The rheumatologist I saw here today told me that the sudden onset of symptoms I came down with in July are not at all indicative of GCA and he is checking more things.   
    Has anyone on this list had a negative temporal artery biopsy but whose doctor still diagnosed you with GCA?   Based on my symptoms, my St. Louis Rheumy still put me on 60 mg. Prednisone to alleviate symptoms.   I've been on this dose for almost three weeks and a Sed Rate taken today came back normal (because of being on Prednisone).  
 This is very frustrating because I seem to have all the symptoms and yet I am getting mixed messages.  
   One more thing:   I have had persistent, very tender scalp pain on the top of my head which also includes sores which bleed and are scabbing over.   The scalp has been like this since before I was on the Prednisone.   Tender scalp is one of the symptoms of GCA, so I think I probably do have it.    Any thoughts here?

A coexisting problem is reactive airway disease which was very disabling last 7 years since being exposed to fumes. Asthma meds little help.

I started using 10,000 D3 daily and keeping track of serum D with doc and hone testing. The results have been impressive. The weak jellyness of my muscles is gone. I am able to exercise and do housework without collapsing . My breathing is so improved that we are reducing steroid inhaler doses for the first time ever. I am currently on 9mg prednisone tapering to 8.75. We are trying to find the best maintenance dose of D3. It also improved my mood. Recent scientific literature suggest D3 very helpful with autoimmune diseases.

"i was diagnosed with PMR 6 weeks ago and started on 20 mg of preds.  although there was a vast improvement in the level of pain within a couple of days I still have pain throughout the day but more severe in the morning.  My preds have been gradually reduced and I am now on 10 mg.  my question is will I ever be pain free?  Or is this the way my life will be from now on?

"Hello everyone,   Have been feeling much better pain and weakness wise since increasing Pred. to 20 mg.    Tiredness remains a problem.    Went away last week to my sons.  1 hr flight and of course 1 hour 2 hrs before and after, getting through airport and driving to destination.   Next day spent the day at my 9 year old granddaughter 2nd riding show ever.  Some walking.  3rd day off with daughter-in law, 9 year old and 13 year old to Canadas wonderland amusment park.  Used a walker there but gone from 10 to 4, then at 6 pm off to watch the 9 year olds riding lesson.    Fun Fun Fun but I paid for it with 2 days of exhaustion and having to nap frequently on those days.   Does this happen to others.   I no you are supposed to pace yourself but sometimes it is hard.   Do some of you push yourself more when feeling exhausted.   Wondering if I should be doing that.   Through the winter before diagnosis it was difficult sometimes even to find the energy to shower and wash my hair.   At least I can do that now.  Again just wondering if this is relatively normal with this condition.

"Well, after 14weeks of waiting, I finally got my visit for a second opinion to see if I have pmr, gca, neither or both. I saw a Professor who specialises in Vasculitis and she was very nice. I told her my saga, and although she says I have all the symptoms, because of my inflammatory markers not reducing, she cannot give me a definite diagnosis until the Pred. is reduced. I have had difficulty before reducing, so from 20mgs a day, she wants me to drop 5mgs to 15mgs for a month, then to 12.5mgs for the same, then to 10mgs. for a month. She says then I will need a ct scan as the Pred. will affect the result if it is too high. I woke up this morning, and was in agony with a toothache like feeling in my right buttock, I was determined to make the appointment after waiting so long, I virtually crawled home andam now using a stick to move around. This comes after approx. three weeks ago, I had the same ache in my left buttock, Voltarol and paracetamol saw this off, I hope the same happens again. I saw a ""nurse practitioner,"" and he said it was ""muscle pain"" duh! Something new every day with this pesky disease, whatever it is!

"The Research & Development section of Queen Elizabeth Hospital Gateshead NHS Foundation Trust will now undertake qualitative research following the result of the basic survey which we did last year on ‘Your Ears’. We donated £1000 start-up costs. All future costs will now be paid by the NHS.
They need at the very least 300 people with GCA, 300 with GCA&PMR and 300 with PMR. It would be extremely useful if more patients participate. Increase in numbers make it more viable.

Once your initial enquiry has been received research documentation will be sent to you via the internet or post. The postal reply will include a prepaid envelope for you to return the completed documentation.
The first part of a long journey showed that further research was essential and whilst we will be kept in the loop the hard work will now be done by our NHS. This sort of research is not undertaken by Pharmaceutical Companies. Without the NHS this research would not be undertaken.
The NHS works in a quiet sort of way and the important contribution it makes to research and development is often overlooked or not just known.

"Had a visit yesterday to my rheumy who wants me quickly off Pred, because he came to the conclusion a bout 6 months ago, maybe I don`t have and never had PMR!....He caused me great pain when he ""trialled"" me dropping 5mg every week...to see how I would respond.  His next move was to start  me again at 15mg (which I did 5 years ago) I am down to 9.5mg, which is far slower than he wants me to drop..(Img every week he wants) 
?Yesterday though it was a registrar standing in for him, my long standing friend who is very frustrated at my situation insisted on coming with me....well I`m glad she did, just to hear her comments!....""You can`t have PMR, because when you drop 1 mg every month you would not experience pain.......my patients all come off pred at 1mg every month with no pain!""....I felt frustrated, worthless and felt like crying....I have heard this from my usual rheumie before....my friend then said, well if you have misdiagnosed my friend, what does she have then!.....she said I`ll examine her.....she did, and said, you have pain in lower back, legs and shoulders, this is not typical of PMR!.......ignoring the fatigue......so what do I do then....( I explained that I have to drop very slowly, or I get a flare up and it`s counterproductive otherwise) she said drop .5mg every month, and take Amyltryptiline (wrong spelling) for pain......with Paracetamol, and I`ll see you again, to which I replied perhaps 6 months (no point otherwise) no, she said 3 months.....well, my doctor has said in the past to do it my way.......I don`t think I will bother to go in November, what ever is the point!

I was very grateful for all the encouragement.
However, having felt well through pacing definitely have done tooo much.
Planning a vintage type garden then making the Apple crates to go in it, was nothing short of stupidity., I have been in and out bed all week and in a lot of pain.
I am on 10mg pred and have been for a few months, would anyone advise me to increase this for a few days.

"I have split my dose almost from the beginning of the PMR treatment.  Because of the unusual daily schedule ( work late into the night) I take pred before going to sleep at about 1AM and also when I get up 8-9 AM).  When I was at 5mg last fall I attempted to reduce late night dose and had  problems and had to go back to 5mg. I was taking 3mg in the evening and 2mg in the morning.
I stayed there until May, when I tried another reduction. This time I reduced morning dose and I went from 5 to 4.5 and shortly after to 4mg with no problem. So now that I am starting next reduction from 4 to 3.5.  I still have not touched evening dose, so my morning dose will be cut from 1mg to 0.5mg.  I am thinking that I should just take one cumulative dose of 3.5mg in the evening. I know that this goes against usual recommendation that prednisone should be taken in the morning, but I had much better results with current schedule (late evenings).
What are your thoughts and comments? Has anyone done anything similar?

"I have difficulty in recognising new aches and pains as  PMR related or having some other cause. I have developed over the past few weeks an exceptionally sore back. It started low down my back, almost in my waist, and now has moved to my upper right area. It doesn't respond to Paracetamol but after my morning 6mg Pred dose it does fade to dull. Then it returns with a vengeance in late afternoon and is there until sometime after my Pred and I have moved into the day.
My back rarely gives trouble (although it was one of my symptoms in the months before diagnosis in 2014) and I don't know how to label the pain as one typical to all 70-year-olds, or a PMR symptom that could lead into a full blown flare.
I've been on a roller coaster ride with Pred over the past three-plus years and am thrilled to have reached my current dose. The thought of increasing it and dealing with the resultant increase in the hideous side effects (extreme sweats, hair loss, memory fog, fatigue...) is more than depressing. 
Is that what I have to do or can I doggedly continue with my 6mg and hope that this pain will go away? Or could that lead to a flare? Does PMR get the blame when actually there is another reason for many otherwise unexplained pains?
I don't have access to a rheumatologist, or indeed to anyone with professional medical knowledge of PMR, so I have bumbled along on this journey largely on my own and with the input of this forum. I look forward to members' advice.

To review...I have had PMR since about last March...starting on 15 mg and have tapered down to 7.5 over time, but the last couple of months have been a roller coaster. I had that terrible rash (?) on my back...took varying doses of prednisone to get rid of it, over the course of a month. The rash is gone. I am on 10 mg of Pred daily. On Oct. 15 I tried to taper to 9. It was a disaster. After 3 days I was feeling badly...and fatigued. 6 days later my Dr. Told me to go back to 10...but it took a week for me to feel better...and actually I now awake every morning in pain, looking for the prednisone! I know you all have warned about tapering too quickly and/or too soon! Now I am afraid to taper at all! How do you know when to try again?
sorry to be so lengthy...appreciate any comments or advice. Thank You!

"I just started tapering down from 15 mg. (I had to start over in May). So I doing real well and I'm tapering by half a milligram every two weeks so last Sunday I got down to 13.5 mg. On Monday I had a tongue biopsy done which has been very painful and because they're testing it for cancer I am obviously on the edge of my seat waiting for the results. (So I'm stressed out) Yesterday I noticed that my hands were hurting. That is typically where my PMR seems to start when I am going into a flare. I know that the biopsy can cause my PMR to flare. My question to you is should I bump back up on my prednisone to 14 mg even 15 mg now or should I wait this out and see how I do. The hand pain I am experiencing is definitely something I can manage with. Right now my biggest concern is eating. The good news is that I've lost 10 pounds!

"its a little over three years since I first posted a thanks for all the help in this forum. For some reason I stayed around,
This is another thanks. It helps lots writing about my progress, and hopefully helps others.
I'm currently taking 3mg/day pred, about ready to try 2.5. Stable. I don't have the energy I once had but I'm writing from a campsite on a beach on Fraser Island (Queensland), happy watching a daily procession of whales passing by, some as close as a couple of hundred meters away, on their migration northwards. 
But now its time to move on.
Bottom line is that, for me, the effort required to navigate around the forum, the incessant scrolling, and the glary lack of contrast, is too great.
While the recent changes to forum software were cosmetic the result for me has been to make the forum even more difficult to read and follow conversations than it once was.
Worse of course is the half hearted effort at responding to feedback.
Just as the programmers can wait a couple of weeks to see if the fuss dies down, so I can wait a couple of weeks to see if they respond to reasonable feedback.
They haven't. So this is my last post.
I wish all my fellow sufferers well, and thanks again for all the help.

Sadly my first Rheumatologist went out on medical leave and the new one thinks I should decrease my Prednisone dose to 6 mg even though my Sed Rate is 40 because "" Sed Rate doesn't always correlate with symptoms."" My old Rheumatologist always said not to reduce Prednisone until the Sed Rate was in the normal range.  Has anyone tried reducing Prednisone when their Sed Rate was still elevated...and did it cause a flare?

"One to go!
I am sharing this for all those who are following in the same path and to give hope that, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday, I moved onto 1mg of prednisolone and after a 14 month tapering regime, there have been no flares to GCA and in the words of the song, ""we are almost there"". The target date is the 11th September to move to zero! At which point I plan to drop the additional omeprazole/ calcium /aspirin and be clear of all medication and back to pre GCA days. The reduction in prednisolone has improved other issues with blood sugar levels dropping (no longer pre-diabetic) and also weight reduction,leading to a BMI dropping from 26 to 22, which nurse declared as perfect for my weight. Oh, and for good measure my cholesterol reduced from 6 to 3.5 in past six months, so have said goodbye to simvastatin! Looking forward to celebrating of being drug free.

"After sudden onset leg muscle weakness and high fevers for 3 weeks requiring hospitalization, I finally have a diagnosis of GCA and PMR.   My rheumatologist started me on 60 mg. Prednisone a week ago, and since I thought I knew better than her and was afraid of too high a dose, I took only 40 mg. at first.   My symptoms came back with a vengeance, so now I am taking 60 for a month.   The plan is to wean off after that.   
    I have a specific question for this group:  my rheumatologist wants me to try Actemra along with the Prednisone, but when I did some research and saw all of the horrible side effects, I told her no right now.  Does anyone on this forum take or have taken this drug?  What was your experience with it; any bad side effects?   
    I have to be very cautious with any prescription drug because I have mercury toxicity, which causes all kinds of symptoms on its own.   I have to get all of my drugs compounded because I cannot tolerate any dyes, parfums, preservatives, etc. in regular drugs.   Just curious about this drug's effectiveness.

"My doctor started me on 40mg of prednisone which was a magic bullet for my symptoms but I had some unsavory side effects. He dropped me to 20mg and I am managing on this dose. My mornings are pure hell though. My husband wakes me up an hour before I have to get up. He gives me my prednisone and a water bottle with a long straw so I don't have to move much. An hour later, he lifts me out of bed and stands me on my feet. From there, I start moving and eventually can manage the rest of my day.  I have to walk to keep the pain down in my thighs & butt. I'm currently logging 5 miles per day. 
 Last week I had the sed rate blood test and it had improved some so he dropped me to 15mg. Immediately my symptoms exploded. I had to go back up to 20mg. It took 2 horrible days for the pain to get back to manageable. He gave me some pain medicine which does absolutely nothing for the PMR; it just added nausea to the list of complaints.

"I've posted here a few times recently about the progression of my 2.5+ yr experience with PMR, most notably the disappearance of PMR symptoms along with the appearance of avascular necrosis in both shoulders, possibly caused by prednisone. Since then I have been slowly reducing to the final dose (and listening to Eileen's advice that the fatigue may actually be worse). First shoulder replacement scheduled later this month, and all was well. Monday this week I noticed a really big knot growing on the outside of my right wrist, tender, warm, a little red, then found a similar place, not quite as big on the left wrist. This forum had acquainted me with (among many, many things) Late Onset Rheumatoid Arthritis, so in reading I was struck by the reference to ""the symmetrical appearance in the hands.""  I managed to catch a cancellation with my PCP the next day, and he shook his head as he affirmed that was probably what we were looking at. Oddly, on the other side of my hands, my thumb arthritis (about a year old and quite advanced) was looking a little flushed too. I thought, ""Well, this is interesting, I seem to have osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis going on on two sides of my hands!""  Treatment? Back to 20 mg preds, this time with methotrexate. So now I have to ask the question ""Are autoimmune diseases sequential?""  On the subject of my surgery, I'm trying to get in touch with the surgeon to see what his reaction is to this development. I want my new shoulder! Been keeping pain reasonable with Tylenol and ibuprofen ... don't need much with 20mg preds. I had hip replacement surgery on 20mgs in 2015; double knee replacement on 12.5 mgs in 2016; but this is a new surgeon. Wish me luck!

"Hi friends - my life has been rather complex lately. Have had PMR for 5 yrs, had been on3 mg past 6 mo. Last Feb I was diagnosised with Gall Bladder cancer that had spread to the liver. Both were successfully removed and lymph nodes clear. I am on 3rd of 4 cycles of chemo, solely for purpose of making sure there are no cancer cells in blood stream. Surgeon had been concerned about possible PMR flare but none came. (Surgery was April 14). Past week I have had bilateral low back pain radiating to both thighs, ibiphrophen little effect. Yesterday back pain gone, but in right hip to the point of limping all day. That's gone back and thigh pain back! Everyone on this forum dreads going backwards, but should I try increasing the pred? Big question is by how much to get an effect and then how long before I try lowering it?
your forum has been so much help and I thank you all!

"Hi everyone
I have just started trying to reduce below 5mg in the last few weeks. I've been doing an extended \""ragnar\"" method. i.e. 5, 5, 4.5, 5, 5, 4.5 then decreasing the 5 days and increasing the 4.5 etc.. Spending about 10 days on each. Clear as mud?!
Well, all was going well and I had got down to alternate days of 5 and 4.5 but the last few days I have been getting really bad stomach irritation symptoms (I already had inflammation of oesophagus before the PMR started and am on daily omeprazole for stomach protection). I think the only logical reason can be the 1mg tablets which are not coated - I had avoided these completely until a few weeks ago when I started to reduce below 5mg.
I have now worked out a regime of using only 5mg and 2.5mg tablets, starting with 4 days of 5mg, then 1 day of 2.5mg (for 2 weeks). Then 3 days of 5mg and 1 day of 2.5mg for 2 weeks and so on. Has anyone tried this?? I am feeling a bit nervous about it because its faster than what I had wanted to do but I cannot live with the stomach irritation - painful oesophageal spasms, pain, nausea etc..
Thanks to you all

"I'm wondering if insufficient prednisone dose can cause actual damage to muscles (or nerves or whatever).
We all have different pain level tolerance. So some will take prednisone only if their pain is at the screaming level and others will take enough that they are essentially pain free.
But can the person with high pain tolerance actually permanently damage themselves by not taking enough prednisone?

"I feel that I have already answered my own questions but wanted to know what the group think as when i have a flare (if it is!) I cannot seem to think straight.  Have just had a few very stressful weeks of funeral, son's wedding, and regular family camping holiday but had to come home early as have had what I can only desribe as a flareup.  Was taking 9 mg - reduced from 20mg after second flare up in Jan this year.  I had taken few extra 1mg tablets with me on holiday so when pain and movement became restricted I upped it to 10mg but no improvement so have come home early and upped it to 15mg now and pain subsided - movement still stiff but manageable.  Have slept all day for two days - feel a bit flu like , stll very fatigued.  Any advice on how long I should stay at 15mg - can i reduce down to 10 mg again quite quickly.  If I ask for a blood test now will it show if crp markers are up ( I usually show raised markers with flare up) or will the fact that i've been taking 15mg for 3 days show low markers already?  Am hoping to see Gp this week if  i can get an  appt but like to my own research before hand.

"when I first contracted pmr it was a bit akin to falling off a cliff and bouncing on the way down, never sure what the next impact would bring.
When it became apparent that it wasn't going to go away of its own accord. When it became apparent that it wasn't a trapped nerve. In the absence of any likely medical assistance for the following few months I changed what I was doing. We still had 8,000 km to drive which was difficult to avoid. But we could travel less each day. Less sight seeing. More rest. More local transport less walking. No cooking or dish washing (a terrible impost). Certainly no spontaneous walks up steep mountains.
Trivial essential maintenance became major chores.
A minor diversion to discover that gentle massage, which normally brings relief to aching muscles, cost a couple of days of increased pain. This is serious!
Thus, after for 4 months, I was stable. I could reasonably predict from today's activities how I would feel tomorrow. By trial and error I recognised what aggravated my condition. What I should avoid. And most importantly how much I could do of the things which made it worse but I couldn't avoid.
I've always worked on the basis that if I can make predictions I understand sufficient to have some control. I wasn't getting better, but at least I wasn't getting worse. Stable.
Once diagnosed and treatment with pred commenced a new roller coaster began. I was no longer traveling. I was settling back to life at home. An overgrown, oversized, garden. A truck to rebuild. No routine.
But none of that could start until I was ready.
The combined effect of changed situation and pred meant a new roller coaster. A change in the course of the pmr. What had been stable was no longer. A rather frightening experience as I wondered what new symptom would arrive with a new day. The pain was gone, a little stiffness remained, but replaced by a chasm of uncertainty, and constantly changing symptoms added to the underlying stiffness..The advent of wall staring fatigue, which I'd not recognised while traveling (the schedule wouldn't allow), was particularly debilitating. Certainly not prepared for the mind altering effects of pred that besieged me.
Unable to decipher what was pmr, what was pred side effect, what may be something unrelated but serious. Frequent trips to the doctor to check. Almost a loss of objectivity, at least a concern at the possibility.
I could no longer make reliable predictions about tomorrow.
Pacing helped. A different way of looking at the things I'd stopped doing. I could slowly experiment. Doing things more slowly. Doing a bit and stopping, to carry on again tomorrow. Finding different ways to do things. I no longer had the routine pressure of having to drive each day, I could take my time. 
Three years on I'm reasonably stable. I know that if I haul on spanners too often for too long it can take a couple of months for stiffness and pain in my hands to subside. A rowing machine requires great caution. Stationery bicycle is ok as long as I do some every couple of days. I know I can walk a few km over steep hills and recover within a couple of days. Chain sawing a large palm tree can be done in a couple of hours, but needs about three weeks until the next one. Cutting the grass with the ride on mower has no after effect. Whipper snippering happens over a couple of days, surprisingly with no after effects. I nervously embarked on a couple of months traveling in the truck - with no misadventures. I've decided to give fishing a miss.
I do sometimes wonder why I have a chainsaw. The truck (motorhome) is much more useful.
Over the three years the pred dose has been reduced to 3mg/day. A very slow process that can't be hurried. A few minor flares, under control within a couple of months.
So here I am. Stable. A belief that the pmr is slowly fading, reinforced by being able to reduce the pred.
Most importantly for me, and the starting point for making this post, I can reasonably predict what I can do for the next few days based on what I've been doing and how I feel. Though I still get it wrong occasionally, and I continue to experiment to find out where the boundaries are.
Its taken me a long time to figure out that rather than just pacing myself I predict the effect of any activity on my next day.
Perhaps wishful thinking, but I also have a sense that the course of pmr has a beginning, a middle, and, hopefully, and end,
The change in my life due to pmr has been significant. Some change has been simply a result of growing older - the older I am the faster I age. Either way there are things I can no longer contemplate doing. But the forced changes of pmr arrived suddenly, and unexpectedly - I think I manage well, but I'd much rather not have to..
At the end of the day I can accept ""stable"". But I'd prefer a slightly faster improvement.

"Hello all,
?I'm London born, but I've lived in the USA for 40 yrs. I'm glad to find this group, I've been feeling homesick anyway from binge watching ""Grantchester"" this week.
?I'm waiting for the results of blood tests to confirm PMR. As my symptoms seem so typical and worsen each day, it's depressing to say the least. You all give me hope for treatment and recovery. A few months ago, I developed a rash from the back of my head to my bottom....extremely itchy. I went through tests, biopsy and a number of dermatologists and allergists who tried to convince me it was contact dermatitis (multiple dose-packs of prednisone - the rash would disapper and then come right back)and an allergy to shampoo! Finally my PCP (GP) suggested that I discontinue the 50mcg of Synthroid that I have been taking for the past year. Within a few days the rash faded and I became virtually itch free. So it seems I am allergic to Synthroid or one of it's inactive ingredients. After a few peaceful days the aches and pains started. The worst in my hips. Fortunately I had a routine appointment with my Neurologist. I have had multiple car accident over the past 10 years, not my fault, but being rear-ended takes a toll on one's back and joints! He asked my many questions about my new aches and pains and ordered blood tests. Expected diagnosis, PMR.
?I have written this post as I'm wondering about the connection between the thyroid and also the many courses I have had of Prednisone over the past 10 years. I'm not looking for any answers from the group at this point, but hope my experience will add to the information available. One can only hope that some Doctors and Rheumatologists are monitoring this very useful Forum.
?Cheers! Christine

Apologies for the bizarre
heading.

I thought I was improving and able to do more. .
wrong.

would improve mobility.
I walk a mile a day, Thursday and Friday last week I walked a little further and
felt fine until Saturday,
Could hardly move, dreadful pain and feeling of total despair.
I have been in and out of
bed ever since.
My question is, why don't I get any warning that I am doing too much, I have increased pred by 1 mg today, shall I go back to 10.
There are so many of you worse than me, but today I feel at my wits end, I
wonder if the mental
havoc this illness causes is sometimes as bad as the
physical pain.
Hate to moan, any advise would be much
appreciated.
I hope you are all as well
as you can be.

While it is not about PMR, it is just as applicable to any of us. It talks about struggle to adopt to new normal, and how to become actively involve in healing process rather then passive patient. It talks about the power of determination to do our best to not give in, in spite of debilitation illness..

"Hi all,
Diagnosed with PMG a while ago and took 5 days of PRED; symptoms went, and as I wasn't keen to stay on them, agreed with doc to stop.  However, in May, it returned with a vengeance.  Pains in back, neck, head, sore eyes, temples etc.  Saw optitian who scanned eyes no probs.  Pain continued. Saw doc, he gave 40mg PRED, which tapered down - again for 5 days.  However, in the meantime had bleed in optic vein in right eye - bright light when eye shut.  Optitian scanned again and saw it. Said I was lucky it wasn't artery. Not GCA they think, but linked?  Hosp seeing me regularly to check it, and seeing specialist this week with a view (ha ha) to lasering blurred vision.  
My question is the amount of pain and pulsating feeling I get in my head during the attacks that I've had over the last couple of months.  Does anyone else have this?  Symptom checker doesn't say about pulsating feeling. Back, neck etc I can cope with but head is really bringing me down.  A&E last night, and doc again later today.

"I have had TMJ for a few years now, never severe or too painful. I was given a mouth guard to wear at night, which I have been using 95% of the time (the only exceptions occured when I had irritated gums and the guard made it worse). I have never been quite aware of my facial feature, although I see myself in the mirror everyday and I apply makeup regularly. In the past two days I am starting to notice some changes in facial features and skull. Not sure if I am crazy, but I feel like my jaw is looser, my teeth seem to be slightly re-allinging, my bone cheeks seem a bit sharper, my chin seems pointier and the top of my forehead seems to be very little portruding (I never really felt it before). Now, these changes could have always been there and maybe I never noticed them, but could this be caused by TMJ? I also suspect I have some vitamin D deficiency, so not sure if this combination could influence the changes. I plan on caling my dentist tomorrow to see if he can see me soon. I am going on vacation abroad in 3 days for about a week, so I am hpoing these changes aren't all happening too fast.

My pesent flare required 80 mg.pred.- my adrenals are no longer producing corticosteroid.

The same thing happened after I was very ill in 2012. I had been treated with assorted antibiotics, antifungals, par enteral nutrition and pain killers.

"I know that PMR causes fatigue . But for the last couple of weeks I have never felt so physically tired in my life. I don't know if this is the PMR or if there's something else going on. I am on so many different drugs all treating all different kinds of maladies so it's impossible for me to even say that it's because of the medicine. I'm at 14 mg of prednisone right now because I had to go all the way back up again. And my pain is fairly well controlled . I also recently started having oxygen while I sleep (1 week) because I was not breathing deep enough during my sleep . But I would think that would make me feel better and so far it hasn't made me feel better at all. I do suffer from chronic pain in my lower back and I take opiates for that but I've been taking them for years so I know that it's not that that's making me so tired . Does this fatigue that comes with the PMR come and go or get worse sometimes and then get a better? I hope I get better soon because I just don't have the energy to do anything. Last night I took a shower and it just about killed me to do it. And I even have a stool to sit on in my shower.

"Hello to everyone. I have just joined this forum but have been reading for the past few months. Very informative!
My PMR started November 2007, aged 61. I had been suffering from stress and anxiety for the previous 12 months, following a nasty fall. Although just bruises and pain, I never fully recovered and was unable to return to work.
I was eventually diagnosed with PMR in June 2008 and prescribed 10mg Prednisolone which helped with my mobility within 24 hours. Started aqua-aerobics 3 times a week from July. ESR reduced and now on 5mg.
I have also started an anti-inflammatory diet two weeks ago and am already feeling the benefits, significant reduction in puffiness and no further increase in weight.
Has anyone else found that their PMR began after a period of physical / mental trauma?
In my case, I think deep soft tissue injury, which did not show on any medical scans, may have lead to my increased ESR and CPR over several months. I strongly believe more research should be done in this area.

As a result, she is changing me from the 20mg of prednisone I am taking to methylprednisolone (Medrol) 8mg in the AM and 8mg in the PM. If the myopathy symptoms resolve then she will start tapering me from the Medrol. 
I acutally went to see her today about the possibility of using Actemra (she was one of the lead docs in the trial at Hospital for Special Surgery in NY). Said I'm not a candidate due to another recent medical issue.

"After being at 7.5 mg Prednisone from the beginning of December, 2014, and with a short burst of 10 mg on account of an infection, I began a reduction on February 14, from 7.5 mg to 7.0 mg. On March 1, I took my first dose of 6.5 and then, 7.0, 7.0. 7.0, etc. am hoping to get to 6.5 by March 15 and to stay on that until April 1, when I will start reducing to 6.0 by May 1. My rheumy expects me to be at 5.0 on May 1, but she will be disappointed, as I do not share her expectation.
My ESR has been normal for over a year.
Here are some issues.
I feel fatigue.
I have a pain in the ball of my right thumb, when I try to write with a pencil or pen or when I knit or when I try to lift things, like a dinner plate, for example, using the thumb. It feels like there is a knot in the muscle of the thumb and it hurts to press. I am right handed and use the right hand to use the mouse. I have been using a mouse for over 12 years constantly as I use the computer to write and click the mouse the whole time. Never experienced this before the last 3 weeks. The left hand does not hurt.
My eyelids are swollen and red and have been burning for about 2 weeks. I could explain this by saying that it is on account of the dryness in the air caused by heating in this (for us) long and unusually cold winter. But it has been cold for several months.
So here are the questions:
Fatigue: how long does it take for the body to adjust to the lower dose of Prednisone, and how soon does the fatigue lift? Should one wait until fatigue lifts before going to a lower dose?
Has anyone experienced similar hand and eye symptoms?
My ophthalmologist recommended me to an eye surgeon for cataract evaluation. I hope the surgeon, whom I am seeing on March 18, doesn't turn me down on account of the irritation to the eyelids. The cataracts have been growing for a while and they are really a bother-- am practically climbing into the computer when I write and can't see to drive at night as all headlights of oncoming cars and streetlights have rainbow halos around them.
Thank you in advance!

"Ihave had these two ball and chains for about 3 years now. I am on and off prednisone. The weakness in my legs seems to be getting worse, geesh I am only 63! Weaning off pred for 3 month for a break--Lyrica helps but when the inflammation gets going its awful.
If anyone has any tips to le3ssen the pain,strengthen the legs it would be helpful. They tried me on methotrexate but it damaged my lung so thats out.
Medical marijuana doesnt work for pain either.
Thank you for any info you can give me.

"I started self-injecting Actemra 4 weeks ago. My PMR was still very active despite 10mg of pred and 20mg MTX.
My CRP was sitting at 20 and not budging (yes, I know it's not awful, but it's not wonderful either lol).
Three weeks after starting the Actemra injections, my CRP is ONE!!
Yep - ONE!!! It hasn't been below 16 since diagnosis!
And I'm feeling well!!! I've even managed to get through my daughter's drama filled wedding and not fall in a big heap!
To say I'm impressed would be an understatement!
For more information you can try Googling ""tocilizumab"" and ""remission"" to get some quite readable articles on the early trials of using Actemra to treat PMR.

"I was given a preliminary diagnosis of PMR based solely on clinical grounds: all blood markers for inflammation are negative; all the symptoms are there except for shoulder stiffness (I do not have trouble combing myself), however, stiffness elsewhere is ever worse (hips, neck, thighs, buttocks, biceps, even pectorals and abdominals during flareups) and makes me walk like a robot during flares. My eye muscles are particularly affected, I can only read for a few minutes and in a totally upright position, if I read in bed, for example, I hurt at the eyes and get dizzy, it is because of the stiff neck; a head-forward position strains already-affected neck muscles and the referred pain shoots up to the eyes. All along I had though I had fibromyalgia, but this is different. Male, 56.

"I see a rheumy at the well known hospital ranked 1st in the U.S. for Orthopedics and Rheumatology. 
Diagnosed with PMR about 18 months ago. Started on 15 good results and got down to 10. Took a trip to Europe and had to go back to 15. Stayed there for a while until I had another medical problem and 15 no longer worked so am now up to 21 with fair results. Recent ESR and CRP are normal.
Saw my rheumy for a follow-up visit today and she wants me to get off the prednisone since she thinks I'm on it too long and is concerned about the effects and that I am still not feeling great. ( fatigued, tightness in muscles of pelvic girdle making it difficult to walk for a prolonged time, spasms of the muscles, shortness of breath on exertion, lightheaded ). Sending me for another bone density test. First one was average for a 65 y.o. male.
Suggested starting me on a bisphosphonate to halt osteoporosis and a biologic ACTEMRA to help get off the prednisone.
Needless to say I'm upset over the latest turn of events since the last thing in the world I want is more medication.
At the moment I am thinking of looking for a new rheumy. Am I nuts or what ?

"Hi everyone,
I'm new to this site but have been on others searching for answers. I have had neck and shoulders pain for several months. I just seemed to wake up with it one morning.I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis by my rheumatologist. I have had physio and it has helped my shoulder pain but I still feel unwell. Since my diagnosis I have been getting headaches, muzzy head feeling, fullness in ears, tinnitus and tiredness. I believe that these can be symptoms of OA but I am beginning to wonder whether I have PR. I recently had my eyes tested and needed a new prescription and the optician said my eyes were fine. Having said that I am using my old glasses because I can see better with them.
I seem to have the symptoms of OR and fit into the age category. Does anyone else have any of these symptoms of an I barking up the wrong tree?

"Recently diagnosed with PMR (on 15 mg Prednisone), I'm now wondering if some mysterious issues might be related to GCA? The main one relates to vision. Often when night driving, when I look in the rear-view mirror the lights of the car behind look wobbly, like someone took a mounted video camera and shook it. It's only happened twice in the daytime, when I was with friends, physically exhausted and recovering from a migraine headache.
I'm also wondering if my vision problems might be related to GCA, and really don't know whether to tell the GP or not. I only have a few minutes with him, and from what I've read these aren't classic GCA presentation.
The other things which aren't classic GCA but I have a gut instinct might be related are three:
* Scalp tenderness (veryy intermittently, maybe an hour at a time, and only a handful of times);
* jaw pain, much like when I had a nerve dying, but it was NOT while eating and only happened once;
* pulsing in one ear when I bend down - this started suddenly a few weeks ago and continues.
Many thanks for any thoughts and comments,

"Hi all,
I have had PMR now for 18 months. Apart from a couple of small flares,I am managing quite well reducing the pred on the dsns method. Not exactly pain free but not enough to put the pred back up. At presentl I am on 9mg. I try to do a 30 minute walk each day and try to watch my diet as I have put on half a stone,but I know the pred does not help re weight gain. My most pressing problem at the moment and one which I am finding increasingly uncomfortable is shoulder blade pain and discomfort. It seems to be at bra strap level and if I touch my back with a little press wow it's sore! This is not to be confused with the PMR symptom across the top of the shoulders and down the arms we all had at the start of the PMR journey. Does anyone else suffer from this ?

"About 2 months ago my 89 yr old mother was diagnosed as having temporal arteritis and since then it’s been such a stressful time for us. Despite her age she has remarkably good health with her only main problem being age macular degeneration. 
Her initial symptoms were very mild temporal headache and lack of appetite. Her GP told her to take paracetamol initially but as the second blood test results came back he asked for her to see him that same day. This in itself was a very stressful day as in the morning I took her to a funeral of a long time family friend. Immediately after the funeral we had her doctor’s appointment where he told her that she had suspected temporal arteritis and that she would need to have a biopsy in the very near future.
 I drove her home and within minutes of walking through the door the GP surgery rang to say that the GP wants me to go back and collect a prescription which she will need to start taking immediately. I’m sure many of you can relate to this but it was such a scary time.
I picked the prescription up and asked to speak to the GP for more information as we hadn’t been told anything other than she needed to start taking the tablets immediately (they hadn’t even told me over the phone what the tablets were or what they were for). Only due to my persistence did the receptionist arrange for me to speak to the GP where he then explained to me about the immediate need for my mum to start taking the steroids.
 he look on the pharmacist’s face when he realised my mum would be taking 12 (60 mg) of steroids a day stressed me out even further.
My mum’s latest ECR test showed inflammation count was down to 3 from 65.
However, she has massive daily struggles coping with the medicine.
She’s now down to 40mg a day plus two Accrete Calcium tablets plus Alendronic Acid once a week.
Her energy levels are taking a pummelling. When she first wakes she is so confused and suffers from brain fog that only starts to lift a bit once she has something to eat and starts chatting to me (I visit her every morning).
She now sleeps a LOT during the day taking long naps. The brain fog comes and goes but never seems to be as bad as it is in the morning. She’s acutely aware that her mind is foggy and this is causing her a great deal of upset and anxiety. She seems to pick up a little by the evening but I’m very concerned that her quality of life at the moment has taken a nose dive since taking the steroids.
She has frequent dizzy spells during the day where she actually feels she is going to pass out which exacerbates her anxiety. It doesn’t help that due to her age she doesn’t have many friends left around the same age as her so her days are spent alone probably stewing in her own anxiety and feeling sorry for herself.
She also has wobbly legs and jittery stomach at times.
I’ve refrained from visiting too many forums as a lot of the information is upsetting to read from people who are taking prednisolone. I have tried to rationalise this by telling myself that people are generally only motivated to search the internet, register for forums and post articles when they have a bad experience to share or seek answers to problems they are experiencing. Nevertheless, it’s hard not to get weighed down with negative thoughts when the majority of forums tell you what terrible experiences people have had on this medication.
 I read somewhere that some people split their pred dose or take it later in the day and I was wondering if this could help my mum as this might restrict the side effects to when she is asleep. It seems some GP’s are happy for this to be done but when I spoke to my mum’s GP he was quite adamant that the dose should not be split and be taken only in the morning.
I’ve also heard people being seen by a rheumatologist and wondered if this is normal procedure or would you have to pay privately for this ?
My mother hasn’t been given any bone density tests or blood sugar tests so we have no idea what the base line figures should be. She wasn’t even advised by her GP to have her eyes checked and it was only after a few weeks and having read some information on the internet that I realised the importance of my mum having her eyes tested since the diagnosis.
I basically feel that we’re left alone to handle the effects of the medicine ourselves and although my mum has always had great faith in this particular GP I am beginning to have some doubts.
Does anyone know if the brain fog and energy levels improve as the dosage tapers or are these side effects constant throughout the treatment ?

"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with PMR in April 2016 and started in a dose of ring which worked immediately. I'm the whole I have done pretty well, getting down to 4mg in May this year. However, since then I have felt increasingly tired and achey, by achey I mean that my whole body aches, almost as if I've just completed a 10 mile hike or something. I mentioned this to my GP when I saw him last week for my 2 month review and he said that my inflamation level had risen from 4 to 9 since my previous review and suggested going back to 10mg pred for a month and then slowly reduce again which he felt sure would do the trick.This I found depressing anyway as it's almost like starting again BUT so far the increased dose hasn't made the slightest bit of difference, which makes me think that it's not the PMR causing the symptoms. What does anyone else think? I don't want to continue with the increased dose if it's not the PMR and would it be ok to drop back to 4mg straight away as I've only been taking 10mg for just under a week?

"After over a year and constant badgering from me, I finally got an appointment with the rhumey Dr. I explained that I couldn't get below 10mg of pred before it got difficult to walk. 10mg just takes the edge off the pain. I can't remember the last time I felt completely pain free, is this the same for all of you ? )
Anyway, because I've been on pred for longer than the 'suggested 2 years ' (it will be 3 years oct), she has put me on Methotrexate 10mg in al once a week with folic acid to follow the next day.
I thought only pred was the only drug that got to the heart of ONE.
She has also made such a big deal if emphasising that I MUST take it the same time each week, no alcohol (I don't drink so no problem there), blood test every 2 weeks until further notice and that it could damage my liver, that I am more than a bit concerned.

"I am 65 y/0 male,3 yrs plus with PMR and currently down to 4 mg/daily prednisone.  This issue has been posted before but after recent visit to rheumatologist am again frustrated and posting again.  After the new year i had been doing pretty well and more physically active but by mid May I pretty much hit a wall with nearly constant fatigue and lack of any stamina upon any exertion or physical activity.  Some days worse than others and some with what i would call ""brain fog"" just a general malaise. Still have morning aches and pains which the pred does seem to dissipate. In discussing with rheumy in June he discounted the fatique being due to PMR since my inflammation markers (sed rate and c-reative protein) were in a ""normal"" range etc. Think she considers my PMR in remission yet she is keeping me on 4 mg for time being and has been cautious in reducing PMR which i think is good.  She discounted a link with PMR and general fatique and tiredness and brain fog as i was description. She suggested it may be something else going on and suggested i see my general physician if it continues.   Is not fatique and tiredness a symptom of PMR?  I certainly have thought so, so get frustrated by her discounting any connection. From my blood work she did it noted that my RBC (low), MCV(high), MCH (high) were slighly outside normal range which i thought might be a symptom of anemia but she said they were not significant to be a concern. Is there a connection to anemia from PMR or prednisone?  Considering seeing my gp but wondered if anyone has any feedback on these issues.  Thanks.

"I'm in  my third year of PMR.  For the last six months I've got down to 4 mg of pred with very few symptoms. However each I time I try and reduce to 3 1/2 mg I  begin to get some symptoms.  Either because of this reduction or over doing it in the gym, for a week now I've been having problems with my shoulders at night which are painful enough to keep me awake.  I tried  going back up to 7 mg but it didn't seem to help very much. The pain from my shoulders gradually  goes away during the day and I don't seem to have any other symptoms.  I'm not sure what  to do. It feels like tendonitis which I have had before. I have had several  Cortizone injections in my shoulder which have been effective in the past.  Not sure whether to increase my Dose  to try and control the pain and then how quickly I should reduce back down to where I was  or do I go back and have another injection in my shoulders, particularly the right one which is the most painful at night.  I'm disappointed that after things have been going well for a long time I've got this setback and I'm not just not sure what to do: how much to increase, how quickly to decrease again or whether to go for injection?

"Hello everyone, I wonder if you can help? Just a small thing really but I'm finding it a bit odd. I've been diagnosed and taking pred for 18 months, probably had it for about 4 months prior to diagnosis. I'm currently at 5mg and tapering by 0.5mg using the excellent DSNS method. Have had some ups and downs but so far so good. I found that from about 6 mg most of the steroid side effects stopped, brain fog, extreme fatigue, and I lost most of the weight I hade gained. I took my first 4.5mg dose 2 days ago and have really felt an impact. I've gained pounds in days and am bloated again. Feeling sluggish and irritable. I am also menopausal and realise that that may have an impact on mood etc. My question is, is it common tho reduce so little and feel such a big impact? Feel like I'm going a bit crazy.

"Hi everyone,
I've been away for a while (tell me you've missed me!) as I've been incredibly busy at work (where I usually spend time reading and writing on this forum) and then on a month's holiday.
In case any of you remember, I started on a trial on Actemra (Tocilizumab) a while back. I've been pretty quiet about it as I didn't want to jinx myself, but I can say that it's been pretty much a miracle for me. From 20mg this time last year, I'm now successfully down to 2.5mg and counting. I fully expect to be off pred completely in a month. I feel well, just fat and unfit from all the pred and inactivity associated with PMR and depression. I do get a lot of chest/ear infections which are a side effect of Actemra (and having no immune system to speak of).

"Hi, all! I am fairly new to this forum. Ive been on 20mg prednisone for about 2 months now. My PCP and Rhuematologist arent convinced I havr PMR now. My question is this: Ive started having eye pressure and slight pain in left eye. Could it be due to the pred., PMR or GCA? My PCP took me off statins, not
sure why, and am worried about bad side effects from prednisone.I also have thrroid tumor which needs to be biopsied. Sorry so many issues ! I have no one to turn to about this. Thanks for any imput you can give me. I really do  appreciate this discussion group so much!

"I am a 70 year old male living in rurtal England. I was diagnosed with PMR in February of this year. Pain and stiffness were evident but not such to stop me continuing to be pretty active. I do take occasional painkillers in the morning or evening if particularly stiff and achy. I continue to do yoga and exercise regularly. My hips are stiff and I do have evidence of osteo-arthritis in left hip and right knee.
My consultant said that some PMR can be 'self-limiting', i.e. it can reduce over time without medication. However, he said there was little robust evidence. He advised that I took medication. I have decided NOT to take medication for six months to see how things progress. I am still stiffer than before PMR, I have lost about 7lbs weight and I have less muscle strength. None the less, I still manage a 2 acre garden, fish my local river for trout (climbing banks is tougher!) and try not to be too limited by PMR.
Does anyone have any information about the prognosis for non-treatment PMR? Do the symptoms decline over time? I would be very interested to hear.

"But I am no expert so have not been participating that way either. But I got too smart, getting down to one mg pred. Then a few days ago upper back pains with upper body stiffness returned. Upper back was never a problem before this. The problem seems to fade by afternoon but it wants an explanation and you always start imagining the worst. To be more practicle I am wondering if my one mg pred has caught up with me. I have been on one mg for about ten days, having come down at a half mg at a time. Does this ring a bell with anyone?

"As most people start by saying - I've been reading your posts but I've not written any myself to date.  I need to cut a long story short but the background may help with context....
November 2014 I started to feel very unwell within about 3 weeks - all the symptoms of PMR but no real stiffness, just flu like, debilitating pain.  However, I also had a breast lump so when I saw the doctor, all the focus, rightly, went on treatment for breast cancer.  I had chemotherapy Jan - May 2015 and Radiotherapy July 2015.  Then, the PMR symptoms really kicked in again by the November (stiffness included) and I saw a rheumatologist who put me on Prednisolone - increasing up to 30mg!  I am only a very small, 50 year old woman and my oncologist was shocked at this dosage!  I was determined to taper down and got to 5mg in November 2016 when I had a massage flare up.  Felt suicidal, horrendous pain.... you all know how it is!   So, on the GP's advice, I went up to 11mg and have been pretty stable since then although I've been studying and being sedentary each day makes me feel quite toxic and shaky.  When I move about a bit more, I feel better. 
So, since finishing my studies at the end of April, I decided to start the 'dead slow' tapering guide found on here.  I've been doing it so gradually between 11 and 10 mg for the last few weeks.  However, this last week, the pain has returned and I am now really, really struggling.  I am going away for a few days break on Friday and I am trying not to feel desperate!  I had been feeling so well (and obviously made the mistake of being super busy!) so I'm quite sad that such a gradual reduction over a few weeks should lead to me feeling like this :0(
Wondering what your collective wisdom would be?  Stop tapering?  Increase by 1mg in the afternoon to give me a boost and stop the pain to enable me to go away?  I know withdrawal itself can cause pain but when I pressed through last November thinking that I could make it, the pain become almost unbearable. 
Another thing, I'm not entirely confident in my rheumy as he had written on my notes that I might have Fibromyalgia without telling me (a nurse read the comments to me)!  I tried to ask him about this and why he had prescribed Prednisolone, as I understood it wasn't effective for Fibromyalgia, but he was evasive.  However, after my last flare up, and increasing the dosage, my symptoms were relieved after a few days, suggesting PMR?  My inflamatory markers have always been raised but I am aware that I have also just come through cancer so this can cause the same blood results. 
Anyway, very sorry, that was a lot of information...... hope you can help, lovely people!

"I had PMR and temporal lobe arteritis from May 2012 to May 2014. On April 4 of this year I had continuous palpitations as well as pain down my left arm and left shoulder. This has continued and I have had extensive cardiac testIng and there is no blockage or problem with my heart. In early June I recognized the other symptoms of pain and weakness in the upper arms, upper legs and low back. Inflammatory markers checked by rheumatologist do indicate that the PMR has returned. To this point the pain and weakness has not been as severe as it was 3-5 years ago. So far no temporal lobe arteritis symptoms. Since my symptoms are not as severe, I requested not to be put on prednisone at this time - osteopenia, cataracts and other effects of the prednisone contributed to that request. Last time when I had PMR I had lots of palpitations and the assumption was that it was caused by the high dose of prednisone I was on - 80 mg at times. But as I said, not on prednisone this time around but the palpitations are even worse. Almost continuous. It seems that there must be a connection between the PMR and the palpitations because it all started on the exact same day. I have been put on a low dose beta blocker but that's not really helping the palpitations to this point. I see the cardiologist again in about two weeks and perhaps a higher dose will be necessary. I am wondering if others have experienced palpitations and irregular heartbeats with PMR. Thank you.

"I ask this question in relation to what happened to a friend, not for myself. Let's call hier Mrs. V.
Mrs. V has had glaucoma for decades and suffers from raises in pressure in the eyes requiring specialist review from time to time.
Mrs. V was diagnosed with PMR and noticed significant relief of all over body pain she had been experiencing for months. I believe the starting dose was 10 or 15 mg and it took about five days for Mrs. V to have almost total relief. Sorry I don't have a lot of detail.
To get my question, When the eye doctor heard Mrs V was on predisone she was told she could not take this medication because of her glaucoma. Mrs V tapered off the medication fairly quickly and is back in pain.
My questions:
Has anyone been denied prednisone for PMR because of pre-existing long term glaucoma?
Can a person with glaucoma take prednisone?

"i'm sure this has come up before but I wondered if it would be useful to put the info together. After sorting dosage and getting (blessed) relief one of the next questions is how to keep muscles strong. Before diagnosis I tried physio, massage and chiropractice but nothing helped. However, would any of these help now with the different motive? Keeping in tone rather than returning to my usual exercises? Walking is good but not sure it's enough. Maybe some of you have found other complimentary methods, or have perhaps tried exercises that helped or harmed. I would love any feedback you could give to build up a picture. I know the invaluable Eileen has mentioned the Bowen method and lyengar  yoga which I'll check out. This forum has been so helpful in adjusting to what PMG is all about with so many useful tips!

"I have been reducing from pred by the DSNS method for the last 3 months coming from 15mg to almost 13mg. I was doing fine until 2 days ago when my hip started to ache. Yesterday it was so painful to get up from a chair and and even walking around was painful. Lying in be last night was painful too and I don't feel I am going to get much relief from pain today either. I have had hip pain in the past but nothing like this. I don't remember doing anything different that may have hurt it apart from sitting on the floor for a little while. (I do feel generally more sore across my shoulders and back but not so much that it would make me increase my pred). So my question is this. Is this what everyone is talking about when they talk about a flare? Should I take ibruprofen and paracetamol and hope that helps, or do I up my pred to 15mg for a couple of days to see if that helps? Or is this something completley unrelated to PMR and should I go to the doctors if it continues? Thanks!

It's been like this for 2 weeks now, and i am still in pain (although slight less so).  My ESR and Crp came back all within normal range !   I dont know whether it is a PMR flare or something else.   I dont have stiffness anywhere else apart from my leg.  It is a searing pain on my calf and behind the kness and buttock.  I read up about Piriformis syndrome, and thought it might be that.  The GP was not committed to any diagnosis.  
My question is , should i put up more of my pred?? if it is PMR flare, after 11 days of increase from 10 to 15 should have done the trick, yet my ESR and CRP are normal, so i am thinking may be it is something else.  I dont want to increase my pred if it is not PMR.

"I have had polymyalgia for 2 1/2 years now. I started on a 15 mg dose of Prednisolone In November 2009 and am now taking (June 2012) a dose of 4 mg Prednisolone daily. So I am making progress with reducing the steroid that I take. However, during the last 12 months I am finding it increasingly difficult to walk down slopes/hills. I can walk along the flat and uphill without any problem but when I reach a slope downhill I freeze and feel that if I am not very careful and go very slowly I will lose control and go hurtling down too fast and possibly fall. Has anybody else experienced this problem whilst taking steroids? I suspect that the steroid may have weakened the muscles in my legs, particularly the muscles at the front of my thighs (quadriceps muscles) and that this is affecting my ""breaking system"". Can anyone provide me with a possible answer as to why I am having this difficulty walking downhill? And if you have experienced problems walking downhill, have you found anything to improve this, such as physio exercises for quadriceps muscles, any other particular form of exercise e.g. walking on treadmill or swimming, orthotics etc?

8 the second and then up to 10 yesterday and today. Feeling the relief, not completely

5mg and all was ok. I have had a deteriorating cataract for a year and was referred

"Long story short - had to up my dose to 20 mg for 2weeks from 15mg after being on 15 for several months. So, five days ago dropped to 18mg and was feeling good ( clearer head, more positive mood, more energy, etc ) until today.
Today, six days out, starting to have minor aches but very lightheaded, dizzy, palpitations, flu like feeling and very tired to the point of feeling like I'll faint if I don't lay down. The drop was 10% so was hopeful I could do it. Apparently not.
Will reluctantly go back up to 20mg tomorrow. Any thoughts as to whether this is withdrawal or flare up ?

"Hi all
I've been on the forum before.  Just briefly, i was diagnosed with PMR 4 years ago.  Started with 30 mgs and managed to come down 2 mgs.  Had a flare up this January after a bout of flu and went back up to 10mgs.  I've just returend from a long hol to Tibet /China (3 weeks, very tiring and taxing!).  I was fine there until i got back.  2 days after i got home, i started to have pain on my left leg and then my shoulder feeling really heavy. I couldnt stand up for long nor walk for long distance.  I think this is a flare up?? But i've been on 10mgs for the last 3 months without incident.  Now I am at a loss whether to go back up my Pred to ? 12.5 or 15mg, then wean myself down again .   I took ibuprofen for a couple of days, but without much help.   I would appreciate your advice to ease me from this dreadful PMR pain, which never seem to go away, and come back at will!!! 
Thank you.

"I have had PMR FOR 3-1/2 years...tapering from 15m as low as 7-1/2m.
i had my second infusion of Actemra yesterday. Overall I would say things are better. Problem is, because I feel better, I have engaged in over-activity!
I have had three flares in the past month, BUT, have recovered overnight!
Normally it would take me 2 weeks to settle back down after a flare (reducing on the DSNS method 1/2m at a time). I am experiencing a lot of fatigue...still taking deep, hour-long naps. After the first infusion I reduced 1 whole milligram, from 8 to 7!! I feel that I have kind of muddled thru, but am moving forward. After two more weeks, if I feel ready, I will drop to 6m!! Don't even want to think about that!! The infusion itself is a non-event...takes a little over an hour...not at all uncomfortable. The good days are better...I need to control the activity level. Activity-wise I am talking about tennis, golf, grandkids, errands, etc.....really one big activity per day...rest periods are essential.
trying to void the in-line chatter about the drug... lots of bad side effects!
we will see. I did feel that a bump back up to my ""comfort dose"" of 8m would make the days better...but the whole point of this treatment is to taper the prednisone.

"I experienced a sudden hearing loss--actually everyone sounded like Donald Duck, and then I heard a pulsating sound, like a dishwasher rinsing for a long time.  It went away by the next day.  
After posting my experience I  found that what I had was Pulsatile tinnitus.  It is far less common than regular tinnitus, Information is scant, but one small study found that 4 percent of patients reporting tinnitus actually had pulsatile tinnitus. It often heralds a vascular condition, after all, not an auditory problem like tinnitus. The sound isn’t a ringing, but a swishing, pulsing, or thumping that is sometimes even described as a bird flapping its wings. Of course it fits with the beating of the heart.  And yes, it COULD be the GCA or Temporal or Cranial Arteritis I suffer from. Thank you Eileen and Audry for the warning of thye seriousness of what happened.  I am eager to see if anyone else has had this specific experience.
A woman named Emma Greenwood went on a quest to get whooshing, as she called it, recognized as a symptom separate from tinnitus within the medical coding system.  In the latest update to the codes, which took effect on Oct. 1, 2016 pulsatile tinnitus gets its own designation.

"Hi everyone, My last update was 3 months ago, I have been busy since then.
Last time I spoke I was taking blood thinners for a clot, well off them and all cleared. YAY!
also I had a MRI scan done on my back and showed Spinal Facet Joint Arhritis > at that time I was asking for any information to help. Well I did the dry needling without any long term help. Also some physio excercises. 3 months alter and I am still in consant pain. I can only stand and walk for 10 to 15 mins, then have to sit, and start again. So now I am going to start the hydrotherapy pool that has just opened up down the road, its a public pool but has ramp access for people like me, all brand new and they also have the excercise classes for later.....   
I have gone from 40mg Preds to 17 mg now, and tapering very slow, thanks to Eileen and others advice on here. 
Because of my back I don't have much of a social life, and that's why now my main focus is to get the back fixed as much as I can for a better quality of life. It was said to me to try the injections, but to me pain meds and injections are just masking my problem which I am hoping to fix... 
I hope everyone else is managing their PMR etc and being pain free as possible.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in Sept, 2014.  Initially I was on Prednisone, 20 mg, then on Medrol, beginning in Feb 2015.  I have been using the wonderful ""Dead Slow"" reduction plan since October, 2016 beginning with 5 mg Medrol in the AM, and am now at the transition from 2.5 mg to 2 mg.  Having read here that a 10% reduction is recommended, I'm concerned that here in the US, the smallest Medrol tablets are 2 mg, which I cut into quarters, so I have 0.5 mgs dosages. To reduce by 10% from 2.5 mg. I would need 2.25 mg. which I can't really cut.  Anyone have any suggestions or alternatives to get a smaller increment?

"I will cut down on the excersise and reduce my heart rate I never thought PMR as an illness just an in inconvenience that would go away. Not realising how disabling it was and is. When first taking pred after 4 days the systoms went away, and I felt fantastic, I was told by the consultant that I was to reduce pred by 1mg a month, I am now on 13mg for June and I have noticed the stiffness has started to come back and both shoulders have started to
stiffen. I also take anerdronic acid once a week and calcium tablets twice a day. The consultant led me to believe that PMR does go away. Has anyone out there recovered or are still taking  Pred as maintenance. Does the weight reduce once you are on a low dose of Pred (what is classed as a low Dose.

"I have been busy and miserable with PMR since February of this year and I find it very helpful to read all the variations that occur with others who have this disease - this is a really great blog site. 
One issue that I have not read much about (or maybe I just missed the discussions) is the severe hand pain that occurs with PMR – it seems that most discussion is regarding the medication effect on the arm and leg joint pain (that I indeed have). 
I am finding that as the prednisone (and in my case, also methotrexate) seem to be reducing the pain much earlier in the day or almost completely down to a very minor ache – the pain in both hands is not reducing until much later in the day and starts to recur in the late evening, making getting to sleep uncomfortable.
 In the morning the pain and lack of muscle control is such that sometimes I am unable to open a jam jar lid or the front door handle – and it has severely reduced my ability to play favorite sport - racquetball. 
My current sed rate is down to 25 and I take methotrexate 20 mg (once per week) and in weekly steps I am down to 10 mg of pred (per day).
 I would appreciate comments by others who still have, or have passed by the hand pain issue of PMR and how they have handled it.
Thanks everyone

"I am having horrible hand pain in my right hand which is my strong hand. This has bee ongoing for some time and my rheumatologist has scheduled for an MRI which I've had to cancel once because I was in the hospital. And then wanted to wait until I was on a lower dose of prednisone before we rescheduled the MRI. And now recently it was so bad and I and was hurting all over that I assumed I was in a flare and had been pushing myself so I'm now back up to 15 mg but the pain in my hand today is excruciating. And it seems the more I use it the worse it gets. This does not seem like PMR to me. At least not from what I understand of PMR pain. There is some slight swelling and the elbow on that hand also hurts. I do take opiates because of my lower back and obviously that is not even taking care of this pain. So what I'm asking for is your opinions. Does anyone think that this could possibly be pmr? Is there anything else you think it could possibly be? Have you got any suggestions on how I could treat this at home? Obviously I can't get hold of my doctor till tomorrow and I've already sent her an e-mail so she'll see it first thing. I would go to the emergency room but since I'm already on opiates I know they will refused to treat me. Please any suggestions would be appreciated

"I haven't been here for awhile, mainly because it has been a roller coaster ride since my husband's diagnosis.
Shortly after starting treatment, he was put on steroids and then weekly Embrol ( not a steroid ) injections were added. 
Then his doctor decided to start tapering his steroids. Shortly afterward, she quit, no warning, left the medical practice. Many patients were left stranded. 
So my husband was left without a rheumatologist! It took well over s month to  find a good one. 
Since my husband's mother and aunt had a different and more serious auto- immune disease, scleroderma , the new rheumatologist isn't certain my husband has Polymyalgia Rheumatica. 
He has ruled out scleroderma. The steroid tapering continues. I have been optimistic and encouraging all along, primarily because I tend to be optimistic by nature. 
But suddenly,  worries have crept up p, so unusual for ne, and I need perspective. Even before his diagnosis, my husband seemed to be quickly aging - and now it is even worse. He naps much of the day.
He tires easily and yet he feels batter physically. He has been put on an extremely light exercise program for 15 minutes twice a day, basically pedaling a stationary bike with no friction, not even enough to raise his heart rate. This seems very sensible abd ut boosts his spirits and leaves him feel more in control.. 
I am very glad he is allowing his body to heal. Here is my probably very irrational concern: that he is aging quickly and that this will not be reversible. I feel very selfish for these thoughts, especially since my primary focus has been on him and being supportive.
My recent feelings are focused on the fear of seeing him decline so quickly. Even if he never regains his old energy, can he recover well enough to do significantly better and possibly function closer to his previous level?
I can can handle the truth. It is the lack of feedback from others in the same situation that has me feeling isolated.  
  He is only 64.

"Hi everyone, Eileen hoping you see this, havent been here in a while due to family illness but really need some advice. Have been at 5 mil of pred for over three months, assuming my body is trying to get back to normal and maybe thats why the pain is so bad. Have been tolerating the pain but for over a week now my groin is agonizing, my entire body is aching and my upper back behind shoulders so tender that I can barely get moving in the morning. It eases a little during the afternoon but still painful.
My question is can I automatically go up to the dose where I was pain free which was 15 mil just to test it and see if the pain all goes away within a day or even hours and then go immediately back down to the 5 mil, or do I have to increase in 1 mil increments to see where I need to be. Im so confused because I was planning on staying here at the 5 mil for several more months but dont think I can continue with the pain.
The good news is that at 5 mil the dry eyes seem to have gotten better, I lost the chipmonk cheeks which I never minded and the increased appetite has eased up but all the pain has returned so not sure which is the lesser of the evil.
Yesterday I was limping due to my groin hurting so bad, xrays showed its not my hips.
Thank you,

"Hi.   I'm 66 and was diagnosed with PMR about four months ago.   I was happy to get the diagnosis because I thought I had fibromyalgia and that it was simply untreatable.   The doc put me on 20mgs of prednisone.  I told her I thought I was improving based on faster gait and less pain in hips, but still pain in neck and shoulders.   So she kept me on the 20.   Blood tests showed modest reduction in inflammation.   Now, about a month later, I feel worse.   I'm good if I'm not doing any kind of sustained exertion, but after walking up a hill for, say, 10 minutes, I get bad pains in shoulder/neck and sometimes hips.  Lately I've had to stop and sit for a while just to let the pain subside.   I'm also struggling with depression because my quality of life has really gone downhill, and friends are driving me crazy by telling me to ""exercise my way out of it.""    I'm wondering whether I may have FM or something else after all.   Thanks in advance for advice!

"When GCA was discovered over 5 years ago, I was put on to 20mg immediately, in hospital,  it worked immediately  Thereafter fairly frequent visits to Rheumatology at the same hospital.  A couple of months later I suddenly developed PMR, nobody had warned me about it so it was very frightening.
Since then I have been on Prednisolone, gradually trying to lower dosage.  This has usually brought back symptoms if I take the dosage too far down.
Eileen told me previously that it is not always wise to go down too fast, although I thought I had been doing that.
However, I have recently been having lots of tummy pains.  A few months ago I had a check up in my intestine and all seemed to be okay, but I've had abdominal pains further up for a few weeks now.  I now have to be scanned this week, then have an endoscopy in a weeks time.  I'm beginning to get a bit frightened of the possible results.  However, again, since a few weeks, I have started to get my PMR back again, PLUS slight pain in my jaw which usually ends up giving me a headache, similar to migraine I had for years.
Doctor took a blood test and says this is not GCA and has given me antibiotics as he had seen a little inflammation in my ear, but they have made no difference at all.
All this on top of the abdominal pains is wearing me down.
If any of you have suggestions or have had similar conditions I would appreciate hearing from you.
So far taking my Pred up one mg is easing that, plus massage,
I had my eyes tested a few months ago.  The optician knew to check for vision damage relating to GCA, but there is no sign of difficulty there.
We don't have an easy time of it, do we?
Fingers crossed please for my two hospital tests this month.

"My Pulmonologist and I are doing an experiment with Vit D 3 for my reactive airway disease made worse by pred and PMR. My beginning level was 31.5 ng/ ml ( UK 80nm/l) . This is considered low normal in the US. A case study in the UK about a patient with a similar pulmonary problem was totally reversed when her blood D level was ~ 200 nj/l. 
There is an online calculator for Vit D intake to reach this high normal level.
so I take 10,000 Iu D3 daily and monitor my blood level until I reach that target goal. I check my blood level every month either Doctor blood test or home test from the vitaminDcouncil.
i feel enormously better. Specifically my breathing has improved where I can walk up steps without stopping to breath, use less ""rescue"" inhalers and can do 30 min either TaiChi, stationary bike or sitting chigong. My mood has improved. 
I am at 10.25 pred, slow taper, diagnosed 12/2015 and am 75yrs old.
Recent studies have suggested- not ""proved""that higher D3 blood levels Improve or mitigate autoimmune disease. The research is all over the place because different doses are studied. 
Like with PMR older doctors are afraid or unaware of newer research. There are no documented reports of Vit D toxicity in the higher doses. 
I will keep you posted.

I think I have done pretty well - Started Nov '14 on 20mg and am at present on 3.5mg - and not  had any flares ( fingers crossed). Gps opinion as follows - I really should be off pred by now and also should decrease 1mg every time I am reducing.  Also said not to believe everything I read on this forum.  Only for this forum I don't know where I would be.  I was asked who is managing my PMR and my honest answer was myself.  Am too angry to go into details now grrrrrrrr.  
Yes has anyone taken Ranitidine 150mg twice a day - if so could you let me know how you got on with them?  I couldn't take omeprazole as I had been on them 10years or more and they were ineffective for reflux - dr. changed me to lansoprazole - can't take them due to severe constipation.

"Hi Eileen if you are around....I have had PMR for 17 months and I have just dropped successfully to 10mg and will stay there for 5 weeks which suits my calender.  I drop very slowly at half mg every month now as can't do it any differently without side effects. 
My query is, having reached the magic 10mg, do I have to stay there for longer than 5 weeks or can I try dropping to 9.5mg and if successful try to slowly reduce to 7.5 at the same rate and then stay there for a bit. I am aware that it can be difficult dropping from 7.5 to 5mg because of the adrenal glands.   I do not want to do anything in a hurry as I don't want a flare and have to go back up. Had one of those when my rheumie dropped me down too fast at the beginning of my journey and I don't want a repeat.    I will definitely be doing the DSNS method once I reach 5mg if I am lucky enough to reach that, which won't be till 2018 in any event.

"Having had PMR 6 years (questionable by my second rheumie)  I am at 10.5mg....reducing with very slow method....
I marvel at the posts that do several miles walks and other exercises....and wonder am I doing something really wrong.....
I tried a bit of a walk two days ago and the pain/stiffness/fatigue/dizziness is so much worse....my husband says maybe I`m not doing enough walking, so that is why I have so much stiffness.....this prevents me from doing so much.  It feels like my lower back will go into a spasm if I try to to .....I feel like I am going round in circles.....sitting around not good either!
Rheumie like many wants me off pred, said when I was put back to 15mg few months ago if that didn`t stop symptoms, it`s not PMR....and has offered paracetamol ( how kind!) I can get very low wondering which path to take....
It`s lovely to hear what others can do....but just want to know am I hindering my recovery?
All suggestions welcome!
Thank You

"I'm a 33 year old male (with chronic fatigue syndrome). About 2 months ago I went down to a virus or something, which I have since recovered. I have almost all my energy back. The one thing I can't kick is the daily upper-mid back and chest pain.
it hurts right around the spine and under my shoulder blades. The pain often shoots into my chest as well. I went to ER twice and family doc multiple times in past few weeks. They say my heart and lungs are fine. It's refreshing to know it's not life threatening, but I still have no answers.
my pain usually gets worse over the course of the day. By 5 or 6 pm I'm in full blown hurt mode, racing to get home to a hot bath or heating pad. The only time I don't hurt is when I first wake up in the morning. 
I had 2 massages. The first went well. The second left me in bad pain on my left side all the way along the front, following the path of a rib.
i saw my chiro yesterday, who said I had a rib out of place and the massage therapist had rubbed on it too hard mistaking the rib head as a muscle knot and inflaming the muscles around it. He ""lined everything up"" and sent me home. However, today I'm hurting worse than before. I'm so sore.
i do notice sitting for long periods over a computer or driving long distances aggravate it. 
Heat seems to help more than ice.
ibuprofen does NOTHING to help it
The pain is a constant dull ache in the dead center of my spine that I can feel underneath shoulder blades and into my sternum.
it hits me EVERY SINGLE DAY usually starts around mid day and by late day is in full blown hurt mode until I get heat on it.
My chest will hurt too, if I lay down and put my tablet or laptop on it for more than a few minutes.
ive been dealing with this for about 6 weeks now. I thought made costochondritis, but I dunno if that would hurt mostly in my back. I'm not sure what it could be. Any thoughts? Or tips to relieve pain?
im a 33 year old  basketball coach who hasn't been able to be active for 2 months now since all this started, and it's making my life miserable.

"12days ago a person behind me on the stairs fell into me pushing me down the stairs, i was in a small amount of pain for a couple of days and since then it has got a lot worse, pretty unbearable in fact. It is from my knees down(which i think i landed on) an my lower back. I was on 3 1/2 - 4 pred and doing well before this. Do you think it could have started a flare or should i try and ride it out, i am seeing the Dr on Tuesday and will ask for a blood test as it is a good marker for me. I would be grateful for any advice, im comin up to my 3rd year with PMR, its a long journey.

"I hear a lot of people talk about PMR joint pain...............for me it seems......
for the last 15 years to be all muscle pain.........it can certainly feel as if
the joints are affected......but i am thinking the joint bit is arthritis, or whatever........
For instance....at one stage i had trouble with my knees..couldnt walk,
couldnt get out of a chair......just thought it was PMR...
Then one day a friend said  i.have had knee pain for years but now am OK
His cure was ,...ELMORE  OIL.....rubbed sparingly into his knees for two
weeks morning and night WITHOUT FAIL... the pain started to disappear
then vanished.......
The story was,,, it was arthritis ,and arthritis  causes crystals to grow in the joints.....ELMORE OIL contains Tea Tree oil....eucalyptus oil...olive oil and
vanilla for a base.......and is claimed to melt those crystals,,
So i tried it....two  weeks and no more knee pain............
My wife went to hospital with sore knees ....couldnt walk at all.......had
XRays .. scans  and other tests, they found nothing out of the ordinary..
Doctors said you have arthritis.........
Only thing left was arthroscopy..that couldnt be done for a month.......
So home we went. and left it at that for a while.....it was about then we heard of elmore oil....two weeks later she was walking with no pain...
I had a bunion on my right toe...very painful, moreso at night..there was no movement in the toe at all........so rubbed elmore oil in morning and night
took a few days for the pain to go   six month later most of the swelling has gone with full movement back in the toe....great stuff...i could bath in it...
i use it on all my joints...but you have to use it twice every day..sparingly...
Any way i suppose i got a bit off course there.......
but that is my opinion only.....for some thing that i think about and seems
 to suit ME........so when my joints get sore its out with the elmore oil...

"Diagnosed in April 2016 and started on 15mg. Excellent results within 24 hours. Tapered to 12.5, then 10 and was doing well on 10 for quite some time. If I tried to go below 10mg symptoms would return so I stuck with 10mg for almost a year.
Several months ago I had some radiation treatment and the 10mg was no longer doing the trick so I slowly kept increasing it. Now back to 15mg and it is no longer as effective as it was when I first started. Feel stiff and achy again and the extreme fatigue is making me miserable.
I am reluctant to go above 15mg since the thought of having to be at a higher dose then when I started over a year ago is a major set back to me psychologically. I figured by now I would have reduced my dosage and be well into the process of losing the weight I gained.
Am I being foolish not to try doses above 15mg or should I try to stick with it and hope that it eventually works as it did in the past ?
Thanks in advance.

"I am so frustrated with my close-up vision. I wonder if other people on prednisone are having problems with their close-up vision to. My vision has gotten so bad that I can only see up close for about 5 to maybe 10 minutes before my eyes start to blur. I have been treating for dry eyes and my eye doctor and ophthalmologist say they are good now and I'm continually using Restasis and drops. So I don't think it's dry eye causing the problem I really think it's the prednisone. I just came from the eye doctor yesterday and he checked my vision once again and my vision is fine when I'm in there because I haven't been reading for a while. So it's not my prescription for my glasses. I'm really at a loss and I am so frustrated because I can't read. . My eye doctor doesn't seem to have any answers for me either. I was hoping I might get some from this group.

"I'm sorry but this is going to be a long post. Because I'm going to have to give you a little background.
Okay when I started this journey I was at 10 mg of prednisone doing fine and then I got terribly sick and the doctor put me on 50 mg for three days then 30 mg for 3 days then dropped me back to 10 mg. During a part of this time I was in the hospital. By the time I was released from the hospital I was back down to my 10mg. I have now been on 10mg for a little over a week and the pain in my hands is extreme. Before I was diagnosed with PMR I had a lot of pain in my hands and when I started taking the prednisone the pain in my hands disappeared which is what leads me to believe this might be PMR related. But I also know that I have arthritis in my thumbs which can make my whole hand hurt. I wear thumb braces. I've been wearing those and putting arthritis cream on and those do help some. I don't know what to do at this point. I don't know if I should increase my prednisone dose and see what happens and if I do what do I increase it to? Or do I wait this out a little longer and see what happens? At the end of this week I will be due to drop a half a mg. Obviously I don't want to drop if I'm having pains. One other thing to think about is that my lower back which I already have a bad back has been lot worse than before on the pain medicine I take for it is not working as well as it has. That might be because of the PMR or it could be weather related. Because our barometric pressure has been high.
So there you have it. It's long and complicated and that's why I'm asking you all for help. Because right now I feel like a big ball of pain my hands and my back are the places where my pain is. I appreciate any input that you all have. Thank you

"well to be honest not much..................I live in the UK.  Since January/Feb have had increasing pain in muscles and hands.  Treat ment ...painkillers, and anti inflammatory.  Red platelet count was 30 now around 42 ish.
One doctor recommended steroids but said I should see specialist.  Urget on the list was a six month wait.  I have paid to see Haemotogist twice and have had more blood tests (now I have gone private nothing will be paid by NHS) rheumatolgist saw me and requested more bloods and a chest scan...my GP will only pay for chest xray so paying for my own scan.
They know what it is not....Lupus, different cancers...Rheumy thinks possibly PMR.  Haemotogist says not to take steroisds as this will burn out...Rheumy says steroids needed....so what do I do??
The pain can be terrible and I feel infirm.  Have not driven since January.  My left hand has now straightened and not clawed but both vey painful and hard o grip, pick things up.  Rheumatogist told me to stop taking diclefenic because of my blood results.  I have dolpadol...hardly cuts the pain.
I feel that I am many months along the line and still have no relief...the haemotogist says that i would need a high dose and that in his opinion the side effects are such that he would not prescribe them.  Have changed diet, lost 11kg and still gently losing........does this eventually go away???????
so to sum up....my skin, eyes and scalp are still dry and flakey.  My hands are rarely clawed but painful, I am still bruising but not as much...the stiffness and pain seems to move about a bit...at the moment shoulders and upper arms...and the pain level...well it cuts across my sleep..but recently had a tooth abcess and that was 9 out of 10 this condition is a different pain...7 out of 10 but it seems to go on for ever...
ideas please...I go to my GP tomorrow morning.

"Is there a dosage at which one regains their metabolism when on prednisone, or does one have to be off it all together for that to happen?
My normal winter weight gain before PMR was 5 pounds. After a few weeks of morning golf, I was always back to my desired weight.
Since PMR and prednisone, no amount of summer golf reduces that weight in the slightest. (I played well over 100 rounds last summer on a par 70 course.)

"Hi all.  I have taken 2 and a half years to get off the pred.(down to just 1/2 mg every fifth day) I am now in pain again and am taking only paracetamol as all other stronger pain killers give me really bad tummy pains ertc.  I have lost so much weight and all the other side effects of pred. that I am very very reluctant to even think about going back on it.  My ESR was 158 on the last test.  But all other indicators were clear.
I have no muscles at all and find even basic lifting etc. very hard.  I am thinking about walking in water and arm movements underneath so there will be little strain etc.
Is there anyone out there who has been in a similar position and managed to stay off the pred?  Here's hoping!

"Hi  I've had PMR for just over  a year and am currently reducing from 5mg to 4mg having started at 20mg.  For some time now I have been experiencing a strange feeling in my feet as if the skin is being pulled really tight, especially when I move my toes.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I've also recently developed what I think might be bursitis at the top of my right leg making it extremely uncomfortable to walk and also gives me the feeling of being slightly off balance.  Could this be anything to do with PMR or is it a separate issue?  Since starting to rduce from 5mg to 4mg I've felt slightly stiff first thing in the morning but it passes off within a couple of hours so I'm assuming this is due to withdrawal rather than the PMR returning.  Any comments gratefully received.

"Good Morning!  I'm wondering about fatigue and PMR/GCA  I know that before diagnoses and prednisone, I was experiencing severe fatigue.  That has gotten somewhat better  (although I think pred just has me revved up a little - I'm on 40  mg).  As I'm learning about all this and how to manage it, I'm thinking that managing my energy and strength level, my fatigue, is key to managing pain. 
My job is very active.  I'm an office manager for an early childhood center, and pre-PMR walked about 7 - 9 miles a day at work, at a brisk pace.  Plus lifting, carrying, etc.  Plus some sitting at computer and LOTS of up and down, up and down.  Our owner and director have been very accomodating, and I'm trying to slow down, and cut back on my trips up and down our hallways.  I need to work, but, whew!  I'm leaving it all at work, and just crash when I get home. 
Am I right that fatigue is a symptom of PMR?  And that it will continue?  It does seem that when I overdo it, I end up in pain.  And really just weak.  It's like I can't hold my body upright and just need to lay down.

"have had a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia for years, and months ago felt I needed to go see my arthritis doctor and share with him symptoms I've been experiencing that are above and beyond my.fibro pain. I saw him back in Feb., and just today had my follow up appointment to learn the results of blood tests, xrays, etc.
I was sure I was going to go in there and he would tell me I have RA, however that was not the case. He diagnosed me with PMR. This is the first I have heard of this. I am being put on low dose prednisone, taken at night. He said that it is possible I will get almost immediate relief. I am 54. I've had 3 surgeries on my left shoulder, last 2 having to do with a total shoulder replacement. My orthopedic surgeon I am to see next week says my right shoulder now needs replaced. I've not been pain free from my left shoulder replacement, and to think of going through the same surgery for my right shoulder with the possibility of no pain relief is daunting. I don't know what to believe. My arthritis doctor says no more surgeries till we see if the prednisone treatment works. Oh HAPPY DAYS if it does, but why am I just now being diagnosed with PMR? I've had this pain in/across my shoulders, neck and down my arms for years, suffering much discomfort and limiting my ability to do normal daily routine things without pain and discomfort. I am anxious to take my first dose of prednisone tonight. I pray this works. My one MAJOR complaint, my insurance does not cover this drug. What the hell?!? I'm not asking for oxycontin for jeeps sake. I don't even like the thought of taking those king of narcotic drugs, and I never have. But people get prescient them all the time for pain less invasive than what I deal with EVERY SINGLE DAY. Does this upset anyone else that you have to pay out of pocket for prednisone?

WOW.
It didn't take away all the discomfort but it sure does help.
Now I take my 8 mg of prednisone in the AM, and my 50 mg of Tramadol before bed and I'm doing so much better.
I told my GP about it, and he said ""there are a WHOLE LOT of more destructive drugs you could be taking than Tramadol,"" and totally supported my plan.

"I just got out of the hospital having been quite sick with a chest congestion. Not that that really has any bearing on what I'm about to say. But before I went in the hospital I went to a clinic because I was so sick and the physician assistant that I saw cared more about correcting the way I said the name of the disease then taking care of my illness. Apparently this whole time I have been saying the name of this disease incorrectly. It was a slight mispronunciation but I felt it was irritating as I'm trying to breathe for her to bother to take the time to go check the proper pronunciation and come back and tell me that she was right and I was wrong. And she still didn't understand the treatment method with prednisone because she kept asking me if 10 mg was the dose I was maintaining it on. I kept trying to explain to her that I was still tapering but she never did quite understand. I don't know which is worst, this PA or the PA that laughed at me when l told him and he said I made up the disease.

"I was diagnosed with Temporal Lobe Arteritis more than 5 years ago, and Polymyalgia started within 3 months.
I have been on steroids ever since.  My doctor encouraged me to lower my dosage very gradually but every time I got down to 5mg per day the pain flared up and she had to put me on a high dose again.
Over the last year/few months I seem to have developed gut and abdominal problems in that order.  I'm being attended to for these.  One unfortunate side effect of one of the drugs I was given Esomeprazole meant I had to come off a beta blocker for my long standing palpitations.  As if life weren't hard enough.
Now I have developed what the doctor thought was a swollen gland on the left hand side.  If I don't try to keep my head reasonably raised it always results in some jaw pain and a headache, plus some earache.  Doctor checked my ear and said there appeared to be a slight infection and put me on a course of amoxisillin.  This has made no difference.  He also checked my shoulder and neck pain which appeared recently and it looks as though the polymyalgia is returning.  I will see him again this week.
Have any others had similar situations, particularly the recent gland/jaw, ear/bad headache?  I feel as though I've had health problems since the end of last year, although the palpitations are much longer standing..I've had two angiograms, but was declared clear.
Do you think the two conditions are returning together i.e. shoulder pains and recent jaw area pains?
It was very interesting to read your previous discussions, although it is a pity they are quite ""old"".  However, some of you might still be reading articles, and I would be very pleased to read them
Good luck and better health to all.

"Without going through the whole tale, my 7 months on Prednisone have been equal parts pain free and painful.  A cold or virus threw everything out of whack about a month ago and the Rheumy and I have struggled to get me at a dose level that keeps me pain free again.
For the last short while I've taken 20 mg of Pred each morning and that has done a good job on the pain and inflammation but seems to wear off around 2-4 am, before I take my next dose.  On 1/2 to 3/4 of the mornings I'm pretty crippled by the pain/inflammation for 6 hours until the morning dose of prednisone kicks in.   I'll be seeing the rheumy next Thursday and I'm sure he'll want me to split the dose (we did this before with moderate success) so I have better results over the full 24 hours.  How to split the dose is where he and I differ.  
I think I should take the 20 mg in the morning and then take 10 mg when I go to bed.  This way I should go to sleep before the 10 mg kicks in and it should help keep the pmr down until my morning dose of 20 mg.
The rheumy literally splits the dose, having me take 10 mg at 6 am and another 10 mg at 6 pm.  We did this before with moderate success but I don't think that gives me enough and also makes it difficult or impossible to sleep because the evening dose is at full effect about the time I go to bed.  
Thoughts anyone?  How have you split doses?  I don't really care about lowering my prednisone dose at this point.  I just want to try and be pain/inflammation free for more than a few days at a time.  I figure once I get on a stable, effective dose I can start thinking about reducing again.

"Hi, I wonder if Eileen can advise me or anyone else!
I have had PMR for about 7 years & have only been able to reduce to 5mg at best.
Only seen Rheumatologist once who suggested I take Methotrexate. However i have primary immune deficiency with infusions evry few weeks of Gamma Globulin to help with this condition so quite rightly my Immunologist thought this totaly unsuitable.
I have Gastitis so am wondering if Prednisilone(coated) would be more suitable?
Also I presume that as a result of taking pred for so long my body has stopped producing its own Steroid?
Does it make any difference what time of the day Pred is taken?
Lastly how effective is the drug Lodoctra for PMR?
Sorry so many questions but I am returning to Rheumatologist on Tues & would like to be prepared with more knowledge & experiences from others.
Pain only in shoulders & variable to almost nothing to agony!!
thank you,
Jane

"I've been dealing with extreme pain and inflammation for about a year now. My rheumatologist finally told me today he is leaning towards PMR. My ESR has consistently been in the 70-80 range with an elevated CRP. The doc has thrown several prescription NSAIDs at me with minimal results. He's refused to accept this diagnosis because of my age(36) and has finally relented and put me in 10 mg of prednisone twice a day.
I could cry tears of joy right now. I can't remember the last time I went to bed without dreading the climb upstairs or tossing for 2 hours before I could find a position that didn't put pressure on muscles that were throbbing. I still have areas of slight tenderness but I am feeling nothing but absolute relief tonight.
Does this confirm my docs suspicions?

The downfall to having test is that if you have to be off Predn. and I am reluctant to go off Predn.  down to 5mgs at moment and feeling good, ESR,CRP back to normal.  Am concerned about relapsing being off the Pred.

"Having been sick for two weeks I finally went to the doctor. The PA that I saw took an X-Ray and listened to my chest and after talking with me determined that my cold probably ended a while ago and I am now suffering from allergies and may have to wait it out. I told her there was no way I could wait this out since simply going to the bathroom caused me to be out of breath. I agree that it is probably allergies but she had to do something, so she put me on 50 mg of prednisone for 3 days then 30 mg for 3 days then finally down to my original 10 mg. But she said she didn't want me to do that until I got the ok from my rheumatologist. Well she ok'd it so tomorrow I begin taking 50 mg of prednisone. Here's my question well more like a concern. I've never taken that much before. At 20 mg my heart would race so I'm not looking forward to this but whatever will help make me feel better. I'm guessing I'll be hungry, but what else? And I'm only looking at a total of 6 days so surely I can get through 6 days.

"I've just joined the forum so forgive me if I'm bringing up a topic that's been well covered.  Twice this winter I have come down with a cold.  Both times it seems like the PMR has given advance notice of the cold by acting like a flare up - hurting  very badly and very stiff knees/shoulders until the next dose of prednisone when all gradually becomes okay again.  Each time, about 6-8 hours after the pain starts, I've become aware of a sore throat or runny nose which each time has progressed into a normal cold.  Is this a normal thing for a person with PMR?  I was quite surprised how hard it knocked me down each time.

Down to 1mg and I was hoping I could rid myself of it. Nope, pain and stifness back with a vengeance. Doc told me to go back to 5mg and see what happens until next appointment  in 2 weeks time. Doesn't appear to have made a lot of difference after 3 days like before. Is this a normal way and should I ask to go to a Rheumatology Dept.

"Hello lovely people and fellow PMR sufferers, 
Once I got onto pred I felt 1million times better (March 2016).  Now I am down to 4mg and I wonder is this what it is supposed to be like when you are down to a low dose.  My wrist aches in the morning as well as my ankles (picture Frankenstein walking) and I have extensor tendonitis (top of foot aches) early morning and later in the day.  I must say I don't feel super energetic and I crash at 10 pm sharp.  I know I am lucky to have a fairly smooth ride (although glaucoma looming and put on weight (ugh).
I know PMR does what it wants, when it wants so everyone is different but does this sound pretty usual?  Flares are much more dramatic - yes?
Thanks for all  your wonderful support and advice and expertise.  
Really couldn't have done it without all of you.

"To take or not to take, that is the question...There is a lot of clinical evidence to be found for the fact that AA can increase bone density which helps to lower the incidence of fracture caused by osteoporosis, steroid induced or otherwise.  I have taken a couple of doses, and it is causing me a lot of grief with gastric problems, which I have never had previously.  There seems to be a lot of resistance to taking AA for that reason, and also apparently for the quality of bone laid down. Can anyone point me to clinical evidence, hopefully backed up by peer review that casts doubt on bone quality, and any other reasons for not taking AA? I've just turned 70 and my GP has told me that it doesn't matter what any DEXA scan says, but that I am seriously at risk of osteoporosis because of my age anyway.  I am doing all the right things in terms of diet to help mitigate the effects of pred by taking the usual calcium and vit d tablets, and also taking vitamin K2 to help the calcium get to the bones.  I would appreciate any evidence, clinical rather than anecdotal so that I can back up my arguments against taking AA with my doctors, especially if I can point to evidence that loss of bone mass can be prevented by measures other than taking AA or the like. I was diagnosed with PMR a month ago and have just successfully reduced from 25mg to 20.  Will be taking it slowly from here on as suggested by Eileen.

"Folks,
I would really, REALLY appreciate your insight and guidance as I’m scared.  They think I may have PMR although the tests are quite inconclusive other than to show an elevated autoimmune marker.      But I have / had the classic symptoms such as overnight onset of severe shoulder, leg and hand pain; weight loss and extreme fatigue.    Interestingly 90% of the joint pain symptoms have disappeared but I do definitely have the weight loss and extreme fatigue.  I will start Prednisone as a bit of a trial to see if that helps…..and if it does help, it’ll help narrow the diagnosis.   (The sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) figures are normal….or pretty darn close to it apparently.)
So my question is, is it possible to have the weight loss and extreme fatigue without the use of medications even after the joint pain has virtually disappeared??
Any input would be hugely appreciated.     Thanks.

So this is not a headache - it is a kind of fizzing sensation around the crown of my head which is sometimes quite painful thogh not always.

"I have been having a very sore, stiff right shoulder and groin pain for around 3 months now. I am now at the stage of just having had a blood test and it suggests PMR. I have been coping (just!!) on Naproxen but still struggling. I assumed that the pain in my groin wasn't linked at all to my right shoulder pain. The groin issue started when I power walked on the treadmill for arond 35 minutes and had tenderness in the pubic bone area for several weeks. This seemed to spread to my groin and in particular the adductor muscle right at the top of my leg into my groin. I can press on it and it is so sore. As far as my shoulder is concerned I just need to lightly tap it and the pain is bad. Are these typical sysmptoms of PMR? I genuinely feel like I have been going mad with the pain. I am now on 15mg of Prednisone a day as an introduction which is getting reviewed in a few days - I have only been on it for 3 days so far. I am trying to cut back on the Naproxen and for the first day really though the steroids were a miracle cure as the pain subsided massively. It is still sore again in the morning though and if I dont take one Naproxen in the morning tends to be sore during the day. Should I be taking Naproxen as well as Prednisone? When should the steroids kick in? Is the dose of 15mg reasonable?
Sorry for the ramblings as I am very new to this and to this level of pain.
Would love to hear about your experiences.

At the time it was severe. .. since then it has gone on improving, and I am left with some numbness in my thumb and first two fingers on each hand and the occasional 'twinge'.  I'm seeing my Dr again next week and I know he will recommend surgery as he doesn't think the injection is long term successful.  I am reducing to 12.5 on the slow method as I don't want to start the CTS up again.  The question is....do I carry on seeing if it goes away altogether or have the surgery when they offer it to me?  I don't want to have the surgery if its unneccesary, but I also don't want the CTS to come back.  I'd be glad of any thoughts on the matter.

"Hello All 
I am wondering if on a high dose of Pred for GCA of 60mg if it is OK to split my Pred dose at all into morning and mid-late afternoon amounts. Unfortunately I was still getting some GCA symptoms - not severe but I feel not completely resolved after almost a month on 40mg - so with GPs support upping dose to 60mg for now until after i see an opthalmologist at least.
 I coped on 40mg but felt very 'wired' so thought splitting 60mg into say 50mg and later 10mg or 45mg and 15mg might help - but worry it will not have an effective inflammatory result. My GP said he thought it would be fine but I looked through some older posts and I see DorsetLady you mentioned somewhere it wasn't OK to split doses for GCA ??

Down to 8mg of Prednisone now. Am pretty careful with my diet but all of a sudden, I started getting migraines - Once at a restaurant when I drank 2 sweet tea drinks. Could not even drive home. Darn. I hardly ever eat out! That was bad enough but then 1 weeks later, a whopper of a headache occured at climaxing. This is no joke. It is changing my life!!! I know our arteries are inflamed but it seems  I have something going wrong. Could I have GCA now? Are others with PMR having similar symptoms? I have a doc appointment this Wednesday & want to be prepared if you all have any ideas about what to discuss with him? Thank you in advance for your time.

"I am wondering about the rationale in choosing one steroid over another in treating PMR.  I understand why they tend to start people on prednisone or methylprednisolone as they have greater anti-inflammatory properties than hydrocortisone but what makes a doc start someone on prednisone for a year and only then change them to methylprednisolone?

"I just keep seeking advice from you all.  I am having issues with BP elevation on 15 mg prednisone.  AT 12.5 mg had slight elevation into the 140's and 150's, but was given ativan (to act as a smooth muscle relaxant) and it kept BP into a more normal range.  I have phoned my doctor and left a message and believe it or not, he called me back and said he would order a low dose of metropolol to take twice a day to lower BP.  Mind you, I do not have BP problems as a rule, so I know it is the prednisone.  Has anyone else had this issue?  I seem to have side effects from just about any medication, so my doctor always starts me on the lowerst dose or I may even have to split some pills.  I have no idea why my system reacts like that.  Anyway, I feel like a pest already, asking everyone so many questions, but you all have been very gracious about it and have always helped.

"A few weeks ago, I had been experiencing some pressure in my right temple. It felt like someone was gently pressing their thumb against it. Then I had a bad headache/eye pain for about 2 days, thinking that it was just my sinuses as sinus issues do run in my family on my dads side and I seem to have his pattern of really bad sinus infections as well. The headache went away as well as the throbbing pressure for a little while but then the throbbing came back. It used to come off and on but on Friday of last week it got worse and went from my temple to my face and changed to this really annoying, intense throbbing sensation kind of like when your eye begins to throb, just in my head and temple. It began to get worse and I began to feel not dizzy but very off; hazy or dazed. I was also very stiff in the legs and weak ( not 100% sure if thats from whatever this is or if its because of my already poor eating habbits) Yesterday and Monday the throbbing somewhat stopped but then the area above my right eyebrow, as well as that side of my face and the tops of my head started to feel like they were burning a bit. I didn't eat until dinner time so I'm sure that made my weakness so much worse but after having a full meal I felt better energy wise. Today I was able to get up out of bed without feeling like my legs had been stuck on in the opposite direction and the throbbing sensation is slowly going away with only a tiny bit of burning every now and then. Unfortunately, a new symptom has also popped up which has me a bit confused. I've also started feeling like I'm on the brink of getting sick. Today my left tonsil started to hurt every time that I swallowed, I felt a tad bit warm (about to check that now) and my throat is somewhat sore; kind of like that icky feeling that you get when you're maybe a few days away from getting a cold. While doing some research because I've never had these symptoms during a cold before, I came across GCA and though I literally just turned 20 not too long ago, could this be what I have? My vision is 100% fine and other than that one time, I haven't really had any eye pain at all. I don't eat a whole lot period, and seeing how my energy picked right back up as soon as I got some food in me, I was thinking that I could just be going through a deficiancy of some sort but I don't know how to explain the weird head sensations.

No more hospitalizations for potentially fatal superbugs.  BUT, pain at 15 is terrible.  I was in hospital with a TIA  TWO WEEKS AGO.  THEY PUT ME ON 40 mg prednisone on top of my 15 mg hydrocortisone.  Next day they put me back on my 15 mg.  For two weeks can't bend, walk, get up.  Terrible pain, depressed and gained 16 pounds on the hydrocortisone.  Is there hope with this disease?  My doctors are sick of dealing with all my idiosyncratic reactions.  Please help.  Thanks.

"I was on another PMR site and was shocked to learn of another person who was diagnosed at the age of 30 something and refused to use prednisone to treat her PMR. She is now 48 and is still battling PMR. She was complaining of the pain that she suffers on a constant basis and how hard it is to go to work. Her only reason for not using prednisone was because of the weight she was going to gain on the prednisone. I was astounded that somebody, and this is going to sound really mean, but I was astounded that somebody could be so vain that they would not use something that could control their pain rather than risk gaining weight. But my question is, is there any kind of possibility that had she treated herself with prednisone early on that she might have had a shorter duration of PMR? I know that she has suffered for something close to 18 years now and that is a very long time to have PMR and it just makes me wonder if had she treated herself early on if it would have made a difference. I did post a comment to her stating that she should treat her PMR with prednisone because it would reduce the inflammation and her body. But I seriously don't think she would follow my advice not if she wouldn't take it because of weight gain.

"Just a quick share
Always when i get up at 2am for my pred, I am feeling the best I have, and best I will feel, since this all started
I feel normal from head to toe.
So instead of trying to overthink it, I am just going to be thankful,and use it as my goal, and reason to reduce slowly, when the urge to hurry reduction comes about . I know the pred will make me feel awful soon, and I had to raise it due to symotom return, but I know now from all the counsel here, it was just too fast.. 
Enjoying this time. Thanks for giving me a place to share that at 2:59 am.

"Hi everyone...... had two hours with my nutritionist friend yesterday morning and the upshot of everything she said is here....
1. Eat as many anti-inflammatory foods as possible on a daily basis which include chillies, garlic, ginger and especially turmeric...... you can sprinkle ground turmeric over food or put it into rice when you cook it etc
2. Use olive oil
3. Pineapple is especially good but needs to be eaten away from other foods to gain the maximum benefit so a good snacking food! Tinned in fruit juice just as good as fresh.......
4. Lots of fresh fruit and veg and mushrooms especially good because of their B3/B5, cabbage, avocado.
5. Beetroot excellent for liver so eat a lot .... especially good raw ( I grate it into salads!)
6. She also recommended using a 'sea' product for the minerals especially those of us on alendronic acid and calcium tabs as they leach vital minerals away in long term use...... so look for a product in a health food store called GREEN NORI SPRINKLE which is a seaweed and you just sprinkle a teaspoon over your food as a seasoning..... tastes quite salty but is packed with vital minerals :D
7. The ONLY supplement she recommended is a Magnesium one as magnesium is excellent for relaxing muscles. She has had no experience of using this with a PMR patient as I am the first to present to her ( she works maily with cancer patients alongside the hospital) but says she feels it would be beneficial..... so start with the smallest bottle they sell and see whether it helps.
Look for MAGNESIUM MALATE and take the daily recommended dose.
Don't want to overwhelm everyone so this is the basic premise of her advice.
Hope you find it helpful.
I am being taken into town later on this morning and will buy the Green Nori and Magnesium Malate and get started......

I went up to 9m for several days, then down to 8m...thought I had caught the flare, judging from the pain. I have stayed at 8m now for 2+ weeks, cut way down on activity but I wake up with more pain and I am totally fatigued. This has not happened to me before. Typically I catch the flare & stabilize.
Did I not go high enough to catch the flare?...should I up the dose u til the pain and fatigue are gone?...or wait it out, see if my adrenals catch up?

I couldn't really see the wound well to acertain how deep it was and never though of sutures. The next day I went to the fast track ER - after going to a mislabeled urgent care that said ""we don't do this go to the ER"". It required sutures but after 24 hours too late for this so they gave me 5 days of antibiotics abdtaped the wound. I was sent to a plastic surgeon who handles secondary wound closures. He looked at it and painfully manipulated the wound edges is a more advantageous alignment and prescribed 5 more days antibiotics. The thing hurts still. I dress it every day - no pus or swelling but is it normal for pred people to have so much pain during heaI recognize that healing is greatly prolonged.

"Before I was diagnosed with PMR my hands hurt and I chalked it up to using my tablet too much. But as soon as I started my prednisone my hand pain disappear so I chalked it up to PMR pain. Since then my hand pain has returned and my thumbs particularly my right hand has started hurting terribly bad and the pain in my right thumb has gone up into my arm as well. At my rheumatologist suggestion I started wearing a thumb guard (it looks like a glove.) That has relieved the arm pain and quite a bit of the thumb pain but my hands still ache. I have had a nerve conduction study done that showed I only had borderline carpal tunnel so my GP sent me to an orthopedic surgeon. Doing a physical examination he said I had OA in my thumb. I reported this to my rheumatologist and also told her that my whole hand hurt not just my thumb. So she did an x-ray of my hand and reported that there was nothing on the X-ray. She did offer to do an MRI on my hands with contrast dye to look for inflammation. Quite frankly I'm second-guessing her. The reason I am is because I have recently also been diagnosed with OA in my foot as well and she missed that in my x-ray also. It wasn't until I went to a podiatrist who saw it in the same x-ray that it was finally diagnosed . Now after all of that explanation and background my question is what do I do now? I don't know if this is all just PMR stuff and I just need to move on and where my little thumb guard gloves or pursue this matter further. The pain is manageable most of the time as long as I wear my thumb gloves so I could move on. Sorry for being so long winded.

Rheumatologist is going to start Actemra soon if the insurance company allows it. Takes them about a week to okay it.

"I posted here a few weeks ago seeking insights into new shoulder pain that I assumed was just osteoarthritis that I have everywhere. Quick snapshot: 68 yr old male, professional musician, PMR since Oct 2014, currently reducing from 9 mg pred, Tylenol for other pain relief. Went to see orthopedist to check on progress of bilateral knee replacement last July; asked him to check my shoulders which have recently been the source of a lot more than PMR pain, and got the diagnosis of avascular necrosis, both sides, left one worse, I had read about this, and had a friend who had to have a hip replacement because of heavy drinking. Can also be caused by steroid use, Or by who knows what?  Anyway, shoulder replacement seems the only long term outcome, so I guess I'm not finished with that (already have two hips along with the knees noted above). Tylenol and Ibuprofen are doing a nice job with the pain, but the crepitus you can hear is really scary! Waiting for my shoulder surgeon appointment.

"I had pmr from 2010 -2013. During that time the prednisone made all the symptoms go away. I have the disease again and this time I am undecided on what is the right dose. In the past, no symtoms equals right dose. I am at 7 mg and I experience mild shoulder and hip pain and tightness. I take the pills in the morning and as the day wares on the discomfort increases. By 6:00 AM I feel more stiffness and discomfort. I take the 7 mg and go back to bed. During the next hour I can feel the prednisone working. I feel less stiffness in the joints and tension in my body eases. I am undecided if 7 mg is the right amount or if it is too low and therefore not quit controlling the inflammation.
My most serious symtom is very little energy. I get tired doing the simpliest tasks, like unloading groceries from the car. I am trying to determine if the lack of energy is a symtom of pmr or a side affect of prednisone.

No nuts, seeds, raw fruits, except banana, which Dr. says must eat for potassium.  I seem to be  stymied.  I gained almost 20 lbs.  I have always been weight consious and belong to a weight loss club.  Cannot exercise, due to back, live in country, cannot drive to pools, etc.  I get frustrated, but for months I couldn't walk, had to crawl up stairs, couldn't lift myself out of bed, or out of a chair....on and on.  So, for all the good, things now, I am thankful.  This forum was a lifesaver for me thru all this, with all the sharing.  Made me not feel alone on this horrid journey.
I just wanted to share....Judy in MI

"Ever since being diagnosed with PMR I have ""come down with"" OA in three different places. That's only since September 2016. I asked my rheumatologist about it and she said it's not that uncommon to happen with PMR and my age (I'm 55). I have it in my neck, my foot and my thumbs in both hands. Has any one else experienced this too?

"I'm just experiencing my first major flare-up after dropping from 7mg to 6mg Prednisolone. It's more-or-less a year since I was diagnosed and until now I've been very fortunate that once on Pred I've felt \""normal\"" and have been able to get on with my life. I increased my dose to 10 and then 12mg, but am getting no relief. I saw my gp yesterday and he sent me for a blood test today and I will see him again on Friday. He says I will probably have to go back up to 20mg for a while.
This is so frustrating and depressing - I feel that in a year I have made no progress. :cry:

"I have had PMR for 3+ years, started @15m for one week, then 10m, then trying to continue the tapering. I did not know about the DSNS method of tapering for the first year. Since then I have tapered as low as 7m (briefly!).
stress, over-activity, have causes quite a few flares.
Question: is this normal to be so long into this and still be at 8m?
I feel ""better"" than I did a year ago, but the amount of prednisone had not really decreased.

I been using the DSNS method of tapering with success (rejecting the consultant's recommendation of reducing 1 mg a week!) and am now working towards 5mgs (half way through the 6-5 cycle, currently at 3 days new and one old). I have had some dizziness but have had a particularly 'bad' day with dizziness and am now experiencing severe nausea. I don't know whether to persevere or maybe alternate 1 day 5mgs and 1 day 6mgs.

"Hello everyone,
I've now managed to get down to 6 mgs preds, without to many problems. But for the past few days I've been feeling really ill in the morning. I wake felling sick followed by diarrhoea, hot flushes .
I assume this is due to withdrawal symptoms? I've now been on preds for 12 months, i have joint pain but generally can live a normal life, walks and swimming so feel myself lucky. Has anyone any suggestions how to get through this?
I've been careful to taper slowly and hate the idea of going back, particularly as i begin to feel better by lunchtime.

"Hi when I was first diagnosed the pred I was given came in bright pink soluble tablets. Then the GP said she had prescribed them by mistake - they are usually reserved for patients who have trouble swallowing as they are more expensive than ordinary pred.
So put onto the white tablets - thought nothingof it at the time. Lately I have been reading about how not all of the pred is absorbed and some absorb it better than others. Going forward I wonder if there might be anything to be said for requesting another try of the soluble ( asking for private prescrition if cost is an issue for NHS)
I dont believe I have ever seen this soluble pred mentioned on this site and I wondered if anyone had any experience of it?

"After nearly two years on prednisone, and after a very thoughtful and patient taper - the last 1mg taking about two months - I finally got down to the magical 0 mg of prednisone.  I had alwasy been under the impression that when I got to 0 mg, it would signify that I was now fully in remission.  My ""high five"" moment.  But alas, not the case.  While I am fully functional and able to live each day without prednisone, I know my PMR is still lurking within me.  I still ache in the morning.  I still feel soreness in my shoulders and neck.  I know I am still afflicted with PMR.  Only that i am mostly pain free at 0 mg. 
I admit to being deeply disapopinted by all of this.  For years, 0 mg seemed like the holy grail.  I have to wonder, now what???
Insights appreciated.

"I have read  a lot on these boards about the problem of confusing steroid withdrawal pain with a flare on pmr when tapering and some advice about telling the difference.
However when move to lower doses (am tapering very slowly) what returns for me is a terrible stiffness mainly in my legs. This was one of my first symptoms - I suffered from it badly for a long time before I was diagnosed and it went by magic when i first started pred. When it comes back it is not quite as bad as pre pred and it certainly does not last as long - but I am cerainly aware of it.
So I am well aware that pred withdrawal can cause pain - but can it actually be the cause of this stiffness? or does the stiffness indicate a pmr flare?
Any thoughts gratefully received.

"I'll admit to some envy of the many posts I read, ""I started on 20 mg of prednisone, now I'm down to 3 but can't get to 2."" In my case, I started on 20 mg two years ago and was there for a year. My GP never mentioned tapering. He seemed to think it would all resolve on it's own. He became alarmed after a year and gave me a schedule which didn't work. I had been in pain at 20, and by the time I got to 12.5 I couldn't function. After he retired, a new GP thought I should go to 40 and ""blast out the inflammation."" I did that and felt good until I landed in the hospital with peritinitis. They got me back to 20 in the hospital, and since then, 6 months ago, I've been doing the dead slow taper. Got to 15 fairly easily, am now at 13.5 and in moderate pain. Want to continue, because I need surgery and the surgeon wants me at 7 or below before he'll see me again. That seems like an impossibility at this point. I'll try 12.5 this week, but wondering why I'm stuck at the high numbers while so many others seem to be able to get to the lower numbers relatively quickly.

"Hello I was so happy to find this forum. I'm newly diagnosed with pmr and have been on prednisone for a little over six weeks. Started on 15 mg and was unsuccessful in reducing after three weeks. Without you I wouldn't have known that the extreme fatigue is okay. I now have some of what I call good days, and of course I still have those bad days. I'm sure I've been living with pmr for about two years as I ended up with two frozen shoulders last summer before that i had pain in all of my body that I had a hard time describing to my doctors. At first I thought must be menopause, then I thought my job is just too physical . So hopefully I'm on a course to a manageable life again.
My question is nothing seems to help how prednisone affects my mouth. Always yucky and thirsty and nothing seems to help. Just wondering if anyone has suggestions . Thanks

"A couple of months ago, my right eye felt as though there was something in it.

My eyes are rather puffy early in the day and feel dry although tears do come out.  Could this be a symptom of GCA?
I am currently on 6 mgs prednisone, down from 15 over a year ago, for PMR.  My worry is that the MD who diagnosed my PMR, is not aware of the possibility of getting GCA. I am preparing for knee surgery this month and want to be as healthy as possible.

"I've been a PMR patient for about 2.5 yrs, been all over the place with one flare (at the hands of a gung-ho rheumy). Am just settled in at 9 mg, doing DSNS, about to move on to 8. I have also been recently afflicted with osteoarthritis appearing in my shoulders (no stranger to OA; I have a full set of replacement hips and knees, and two fairly recent arthritic thumbs). Blessedly, since I am a professional musician (keyboardist) my fingers are still fine. However, playing (piano, organ, harpsichord) aggravates my PMR, because of the position of the shoulders and the use of the arms for extended periods of time. I have conducted what I think are controlled experiments to verify this: if I overplay on Wednesday my arms hurt like hell on Thursday; likewise Sunday and Monday. I have been in a position to avoid playing (I'm also the director with a good assistant) but my assistant is leaving, and so later this month, I am going to have to play again. Lately I've also experienced significant shoulder pain, quite apart from the PMR effect, it seems. I'm seeing my PCP, who has given me Celebrex for the OA (doesn't do much) this week; and my orthopedist next week. I also wonder what the nature is of ""prednisone withdrawal pain"" I've read about on this forum. My question: on days you know you will be overdoing, is it worthwhile to take a little extra prednisone, and can one do that without messing up the DSNS? I also take a max dose (3000mg) of Tylenol daily. Is Aleve or Advil a better alternative? I had a strange episode a year ago when I had a severe allergic reaction to clindamysin, and my PCP put me on 60 mg of prednisone to clear it up. I thought my PMR course would get all screwed up but it didn't! Seems strange to me. I'm seeing the orthopedist to see if I've damaged something I don't expect much pain relief from him, and am not really interested in shoulder surgery. This summer I retire and will just stop playing. Except the recorder, which doesn't bother my PMR! I'm a 68 yr-old male in the US and having been through a hip replacement, bilateral knee replacement, and PMR in the last few years, I am so tired of Pain!

"In 2011 I was diagnosed with PMR shortly after my mother passed away. I had the classic symptoms: severe aches and stiffness and weakness across my back, shoulders, and thighs. It took months for a diagnosis, including visits to a neorologist and orthopedist, who had no idea what it was. A final visit to my internist resulted in a diagnosis in minutes. I started on a regimen of prednisone 20 mg, and finally tapered off after 2 years, during which I gained a lot of weight and developed the typical ""moonface,"" which did nothing to eleviate my general feeling of depression.
Now, 4 years after my initial diagnosis, it has recurred. I had knee surgery in early March, traveled north to visit our children in April, suffered a serious allergic reaction to all the emerging spring pollen, and returned home with bronchitis. Shortly thereafter, both my legs, from my thighs to my feet, began aching terribly. Weakness followed. That's when I realized that it was polymyalgia once again, but affecting my most vulnerable area, the knee on which I had surgery. I am now back on prednisone, and am trying to keep the dosage under 15 mg. We'll see. 
I truly believe that my first bout with PMR was triggered by the stress surrounding my mother's passing. This time i suspect that allergies and /or bronchitis may have been the cause. Has anyone else had such an experience?

So this time I have no pain but I feel like I am sick with a cold. I've felt bad off and on since Friday.
Then it hit me maybe this is because I'm tapering off of the prednisone and it has nothing to do with being sick at all. But I've always heard that prednisone will not make you fatigued any better but it just takes care of the pain and inflammation. So I guess I need to know what you think.

"A while ago I posted about a big problem I suddenly developed when my hands and fingers became very swollen,painful, and numb in my thumb and first and second finger.  I also had pains in my wrist and going up as far as my elbow.  I could hardly lift a cup of tea and certainly not a whole kettle...driving was impossible, opening packets and jars had to be done by someone else.  I put myself up from 7.5 of my Pred dose to 10, but it had had no effect.  eventually my sensible GP increased that to 15 saying it would at least rule out other causes if it was a flare from the PMR and sure enough after ten days the swelling has almost completely gone and I have about 80% of my hand strength back and am attempting to drive again.
I'd noticed that a couple of other people on the forum had had similar problems so I just thought it would be useful to share this, as I was panicking about Late Onset RA, or a sudden devastating attack of Carpal Tunnell.   At least they seem to have been ruled out.
I'm not sure how I feel about having gone back up to 15 of the Pred though and worried that it will recurr when I drop down again.  Dr wants me to stay on 15 for 6 weeks and then drop to 12.5, so that's what I will do although maybe in smaller steps. Also I 'm booked for a test for CTS at the hospital, which he says I should still go for, as there may be an underlying cause.  It seems quite a few of us end up with CTS as well.  Ah well...

"3 years ago I started down this strange road of PMR. It took the Dr's a few months to give it a name. I tell people that I believe PMR stands for "" we have no idea what is causing this but we are going to call it PMR"". But in August they prescribed 20 mg of Prednisone and I woke up the next morning feeling like a new man. I called it a miracle drug at that time. Over time when the side effects started to show I started to wonder about the ""miracle"" part of that.
In time my research led me to this forum and I believe, the knowledge and support to survive this confusing illness. Reading the posts of people who were struggling far worse than I was made me feel fortunate at times. Other times I felt bad for myself or frustrated or depresssed. I could not determine if things happening to me were side effects of the drug or life events.
I adopted the ""dead slow"" method of Prednisone reduction and I firmly adhered to taking as much prednisone as I needed to be pain free. It took me three separate attempts to get below 7.5mg. 5 mg was another tough one. A heart attack in April of 2016 pushed my focus to  another area. Luckily it was not a bad diagnosis and is being treated with medication. I started walking more and a bad hip flared up. I am looking at a hip replacement this summer.
Today I am on day 4 of no prednisone and tomorrow a .5mg pill. I can see the end of the tunnel. I don't feel like I  did 5 years ago when I get up in the morning but I doubt any of us do. I have aches and pains but I feel lucky.
So thank you to all  and never give up. The quote I read here this morning is going on my wall - ""The devil whispered in my ear, ""you are not strong enough to withstand the storm"". Today I whispered in the devil's ear, ""I am the storm"".

"A couple of comments first:  
MY CONDITION
I was diagnosed with PMR 2 years this coming June.  I was prescribed 20mg of Prednisone, and all symptoms disappeared with the first tablet.  I am now down to 3.5 and working to be totally free of Prednisone soon.  I am continually monitored by my understanding physician, a DO.
WEIGHT GAIN
i am very fortunate, from what I've read, that I have gained only 8-9 pounds during this time.  It seems that Prednisone shuts down one's metabolism and that sugar is the culprit in my case, (I've long acknowledged that food for me is a means to dessert. . . .and here I am. . . . eeekkkk. )
LEG CRAMPS
Powerade (or like sports drink) gives almost immediate relief, when leg cramps begin. Cramps can be brought on by lack of fluids in the body.   Some take 1/3 cup of sports drink at bedtime to prevent nighttime cramps.
INFO CURRENT TO MY PREDNISONE REDUCTION
My doctor and I set on a course of reducing by 1-mg/mo. starting in November.  By the end of December, I was miserable.  I did not want to go back to 5mg, so I went to 4.5mg.  While the symptons subsided, they were not eliminated, by any means--they settled, at last, in both biceps. My thoughts were to reduce by 1/2mg/mo. and my physician accepted my plan.  I am now down to 3.5mg.  I decided that the pain I am experiencing is phantom pain and I would tough it through.  The symptoms have not gotten any worse as I continue to reduce.  The last three days, they are almost gone; not completely, but so much better;so I am assuming I was correct in my diagnosis of phantom pain.  It was by no means an easy road--at its worst, I couldn't reach for and pick up a large glass of water, or pull the car door shut without a great deal of pain. Sleeping, too, was disrupted numerous times throughout the night as the pain worsened.  Early on, because of that, I broke down the tables to taking one before bedtime, but don't really know whether that helped at all.  I felt no different during the day, even after taking the stronger of the two doses in the morning.  (Being upright and active helps in itself, and I normally feel better in the evenings.)
QUESTION CONCERNING THE SCUEDULE
I don't know whether to reduce the next 1/2mg before beginning the schedule or managing that 1/2mg throughout to the end. (We are fortunate here in the US, we have 1mg tablets.)
   In the document I printed, first paragraph below the schedule itself, it talks about starting and stoping at ""1 day new, 4 days old.""  I understand the ""starting"" there, but don't understand the stopping there, unless it means to go all the way through to the end and beginning again at 1 day new dose, 4 days old dose. 
  Comments also noted that when reducing at 3mg, one should stay with the 1mg reduction for one month.  I assume that means 7 days new dose for 30 days?  Which would mean in excess of 6 months to be finished--schedule time + 30 days for each mg.?

"I have been back from my two month stay in Seattle for 9 days now,one day for each hour of time difference so I should be over the jet lag.Prior to my trip to to Seattle, I had been diagnosed with a broken sacrum and pubis which had been causing me a lot of pain and stress(trying to get a diagnosis).I had several stressful events right around the time I began treatment with 20 mg Prednisone which had me at that dose for about 10 weeks.So despite everything , I began tapering and got to 15mgs where I was comfortable for about a week and then I had a flare. Since I was about to fly back to Madrid, I upped the dose to 20mgs as Eileen advised .
It's been almost two weeks at 20mgs but the PMR symptoms are back in full force, plus I have malaise, nausea , anorexia diffuse headaches , diffuse abdominal pain and an unproductive cough. The way I feel now makes me feel as if I am taking pred for nothing.
I am wondering if I have become resistant to Prednisone or perhaps it's an atypical presentation of GCA.
I have an appointment with a new rheumatologist on the 17th., finally, as I had had to cancelled the previous appointment due to my trip to Seattle.
I was diagnosed by a rheumi who was in cahoots with my husband -both are unprofessionally paranoid about the use of Prednisone for PMR. If it hadn't been for this forum and the guidance from Eileen, I would have perished!
My plan was to stay on the 20 mgs till I got over the jet lag and then go back down to 15. But the way I feel now, Im not sure what to do till I see the new rheumi.

"21/2 years down to 12 mgs pred. Been a bumpy road reducing. Couldn't make it without Pred but it has never relieved all of the pain. A good day for me is zero norco to half a pill. Bad day is four halfs a day. By what I read most people are pain free just on Pred. That would be nice. 
Last month or so feels like I have pads on the bottom of my feet worse as the day goes on and mild pain when I hit the hay. Have modified my diet extensively thinking it a blood sugar deal. Also have been checking glucose levels and it's 90-110 most of the time. Peed my rheumy off by asking for a referral to a major medical complex inDallas??? Any suggestions or helpful advice is greatly appreciated. Have been using the dsns method. Am in the middle of reducing from 12.5-12 and as usual it's kicking my patootie......

"My husband was diagnosed with PMR about 4 years ago. For months he complained of pains in his shoulders and arms and was generally miserable - very unlike him as he is usually a very happy soul. He was still managing to swim 20 lengths each morning after having struggled down the stairs, but was wiped out for the rest of the day. I finally managed to persuade him to see his GP .and a blood test was performed. He then received a phonecall from her at 08.00 hrs the following morning to say that his ESR levels were sky high and that he had PMR. He then commenced 45mgs Prednisolone and the improvement was almost instant. By that evening he was back to his usual sunny self! He was also put on bone-building medication to counteract the side effects of the steriods (although I don't think he probably took them on a regular basis!).
Over the next couple of years, his ESR was checked on a regular basis, and as it gradually dropped, the steriods were decreased. Until recently, he was managing without but has recently had a slight relapse, and is now taking 1-2 mgs in the hope that this is sufficient to deal with it. I think he probably needs to increase them as he's obviously in pain at times but is reluctant to pile on the weight again. His GP has not suggested an appointment with a rheumatologist. I think they only do this if there is any indication of Temporal Arteritis - an inflammation of the temporal artery - if not treated this can cause blindness - as it causes pressure on the optic nerve. The two conditions sometimes go hand in hand so if an individual with PMR experiences severe headaches they must seek medical help immediately. Again this is treated by large doses of steriods.
I work in a Sheltered Housing complex and three of my 45 residents have PMR - a couple of them for many years. With all three of them they initially had the severe symptoms for around two years or so, followed by
a long spell of being completely free of it. They all have had minor short-term relapses occasionally, and these generally seem to be mostly in the winter months.

"Hello,
I hope someone can help me make sense of my visit today.
Diagnosed May 2016, pred 15, with reductions as advised.
Achieved 9mg by Dec, having been hospital for few days I went up to 10mg.
Last week in a lot of pain I increased to 11mg.
My rheumetologist was not impressed, you should have reduced much more than this in nearly 12 mths, and that pmr patients don't need to increase their dose.
Therefore, you do not have pmr, and you must be off these steroids in 6mths.
I don't know how I feel, relief, annoyed that another year has passed and I am no further forward, or worried what is wrong with me.
I have the symptoms many of you describe and he diagnosed me knowing that.
He wants me to have a dexscan, intravenous anadrolic acid, and see him in two months.
At my wits end, any advise would be much appreciated.
Hope you are all as well as you can be.

"I was diagnosed with pmr in Sept 2006. Started on 20mg prednisolone and after a few weeks began to experience burning pain in my chest. This was due to stomach inflammation caused by steroids. I began to take 40mg pantaprozole which took the pain away for a few months but in the past few weeks it has returned. I am now on 7.5 mg prednisolone and still on pantaprozole but the burning pain is driving me crazy. I am becoming terrible anxious and depressed. My shoulders are beginning to ache again and im sure esr will be high on next blood test. Im due to see a rheumatologist for the first time on 26th March. I feel like im in a catch 22 situation, if i need to increase steroids, the chest pain may get worse. Has anyone else experienced this stomach problem and how have they coped with it?

"Hello PMR peeps,
My rheum wanted me off pred at my December appt that was cancelled. By my new appt in March I had pushed and got down to zero (only a few days before). She said ""your numbers were good in December, you should have been off the pred then"". I said that I was still in pain. And she said ""I gave you the Meloxican for breakthrough pain, it's probably arthritis and I don't want you self medicating on pred"". I said that I don't want more drugs. Here's the problem, before my appt I was doing great on 1mg, then I went to 1/2 for a week, then to zero. A few days later, the pain returned in my thighs and upper arms so I started taking 1mg which before had worked for me and now it isn't. Should I wait a few days to see if it kicks in or go up to 2mg. Oh, and my rheum said that I was fine now and she doesn't need to see me any more.

"Hi everyone,
I've been absent from here for a few (!) weeks as I wanted to find out how my new drug regime was working out before making any statement or comment about how it was working out - or not. It's been nearly 12 weeks since I started on methotrexate at the behest of my rheumatologist. Let me state categorically that I did not want to take it and was very resistant. I was however, feeling so poorly I would have run naked through nettles if I thought it would have helped.
It takes about 6 weeks for the methotrexate to actually start kicking in. In the first month however, I cut my pred down from 20mg to 10mg in 5mg increments. That in itself brought about good improvement as it seems the pred was no longer as effective on me as it could have been - prednisone resistance. The brain fog lifted significantly and I could walk again without assistance.
Around the same time I also consulted a naturopath. I am a true skeptic and approached this appointment with great cynicism. I was not disappointed! The woman seemed very unsure of herself and I was not convinced it was not all quackery - but I signed up for a 4 month plan anyway…. and walked away with a fistful of supplements to take and a 6-8 week auto-immune protocol (AIP) diet sheet of what, and what not, to eat. It took me another month, and a LOT of reading, before I fully committed to the new eating plan.
Two weeks later I felt amazing. I’m six weeks in and I feel spectacular!
One could argue it’s the methotrexate fully kicking in, or one could argue that it’s both the methotrexate AND the diet. That’s what I’m going for. There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind that they are both contributing to the state of wellness I have now. I walk without pain. The brain fog has completely gone. I’m no longer depressed. I can go all day without getting tired. I've started losing weight....and DanRower would be proud of me, I am even thinking of exercising again!
Would I recommend methotrexate? Yes. Would I recommend the AIP diet? Unequivocally, YES. There’s a ton of stuff out there to read, but there’s two sites worth looking at: Paleo mom and Autoimmune protocol
I have another couple of weeks before I start re-introducing the eliminated foods but at this stage I'm so happy with the improvement to my health I don't care if/when this happens.

There is no swelling and as i said it is in the leg as much as the ankle do I don't really think it's a joint thing. I did have a very stressful day yesterday.

"Hi All,
I'm a 65 year old male who was diagnosed with PMR in April of 2016. My rheumatologist started me on 15mg of prednisone and it was very effective. I quickly reduced to 12mg without incidence and then slowly reduced to 10mg over the last year. However, each time I would try to reduce below 10mg the symptoms would return so I have been holding steady at 10mg.
Unfortunately, the beginning of this year I was diagnosed with prostate cancer but was lucky enough to be at a stage where I had the option of choosing between surgery and radiation. I elected to go with radiation and finished up my course about 6 weeks ago.
I got through the treatment OK but over the last 2 weeks have noticed that my PMR symptoms have returned and that 10mg is no longer sufficient to keep me comfortable and functioning well. I have been slowly increasing my dosage by .5mg every 3-5 days in an attempt to find the new dosage I need to be at.
Needless to say, I am very frustrated and depressed over this new set of circumstances since, as I reduced my dosage, I was hoping to lose some of the excess weight I have gained over the last year and get back to looking and feeling somewhat ""normal""  again.
Thanks for listening and thanks in advance for your thoughts.

"Hi, I have had PMR for 18 months, I am 57. Started on 15mg, worked immediately. Reduced dose gradually over the last year and got down to 3mg Nov 2016.
This last 6 weeks, pain, started mainly in hips, buttocks etc and latterly
shoulders, finally when it started waking me in the night, decided it was
time to act. I do Pilates regularly which I really enjoy though it is hard and I walk every day 1 - 2 hours, so I do try to keep on top of pain management. I have read loads on here and it is a great help. I saw gp on Friday (not the
one who diagnosed me), he basically said to manage it as necessary, very rushed, not very helpful. Then again he has recommended bloods and bone density scan. I upped my dose to 5mg yesterday with nil effect. Today I
went to 6mg, felt a slight improvement. My main query is should I aim high straight off rather than in steps, so go up to 9mg perhaps and get relief and then drop down ? I also have problems with my eyes, I am having a
cataract in two weeks (already had one 3 years ago)which will be a great
relief as it is really bad (the consultant said it may have progressed so
quickly due to the steroids).

"Hello all and attention Eileen if you are about I'd really particularly appreciate your comments.
As I have mentioned on this forum recently I was 'diagnosed' about 6 weeks ago with PMR - or rather I informed my GP that I hade researched the symptoms I had for months beforehand and realised that was what I had. On an initally rather high dose of pred just for PMR - but only for 3 days (50mg) then down now to 16.5 after  quite a fast taper I know but OK on this re managing the PMR symptoms - and this is still higher than some intial starting doses. 
All through this I have also had what I thought was an allergenic response to native profusely flowering eucalypts - which happens to some extent most years but worse this year when they have flowered in an exceptional way. This amounted mainly to an aching face and sinuses around the eyes and cheekbones and bridge of nose and a feeling of constriction or small throbs around my head. I took antihistamines which seemed to help but not complete relief.
My question (sorry to ramble) is - could this possibly be a mild 'degree' of GCA? - I have realised reading contributions here from Eileen and some very informed people that GCA isn't necessarily a 'black and white' thing and can emerge well after PMR is diagnosed. Thing is I have none of the major symptoms of a very sore or senstitive scalp, no jaw or chewing pain, or double vision - although I notice a very minute blueish spot occasionally flashes into the edge of my eyes every now and again. So if I just keep tapering down and some 'degree' of GCA is hovering in the background am I right to think it is likely to become more pronounced over time ? Obviously I don't want to play 'russian roulette' with my eyesight but I just don't want to take more pred in case when there isn't any definitive evidence (as yet) I should do so. I also realise 'diagnosis' of GCA is more complicated when you have been taking pred for a while.
I have 'avoided' any specialist intervention to this point as I decided to stick with managing this myself with just my local GP who has been helpful and agreeable re tapering and the information I have shared with him from this forum.
Any comments appreciated.

"I have had PMR for 3 years and have currently reduced my prednisone level to lowest level in that period of 4 mg daily, I am a 65 yo male.  Recent doctor visits in the past year have detected an abnormal heart beat which had not been detected previously to my knowledge.  Saw my regular doctor (not rheumatologist) last week and he described it as an occasional skipped beat with some softer beats. He also noted that my blood pressure and heart rate had been trending lower.   He asked about other symptoms such as dizziness, tiredness etc.  He knows about the PMR as he originally diagnosed it.  Some of the symptoms he asked about are also PMR symptoms which made me wonder about the possible connection.  He did  not see the need to follow up on the irregular heat beat at this time but suggested i stay aware of it and note any symptoms etc.  It made me wonder if there may be connections between an irregular heart beat, prednisone and PMR.  I did a web search when i got home and quickly found that irregular heart beats have been linked to prolonged prednisone use especially higher doses. Not sure about any PMR connection to the heart beat/rate.  
Wondered if anyone has experienced this or had any insight into this possible issue?

so, not much has happened really over the past 3+ years. I am back at 8m.
Lowest ever attempted was 6m, didn't last long.....always a disaster when I get to 7-1/2.
Any improvement is measured in the distance I can walk until the pain starts...there is much improvement there. Long time to dink around with 2-3m difference from what I started at. But I guess Eileen is in the same boat, having Had PMR For so long and still bumping up to control the inflammation. Will it, one day, just accept the next 1/2m drop without a squeal?

"Hello people. My mother was diagnosed with GCA last August, she is now on 8 mg daily, the last few days she has been unwell, symptoms include vomiting and extreme fatigue ( sleeping roughy 22 hrs per day ) her GP today diagnosed a chest infection I however am dubious, and wonder if it is the Prednisolone affecting her ATCH levels which in turn would affect her Cortisol levels and produce symptoms that would more match her current state than a chest infection would. Does anyone have any experience of this, any advice/observations would be gratefully received. Thank You B

"Recently diagnosed.  This is very painful.  Has anyone found something that helps with the pain?  NSAIDS don't seem to do it.  I just restarted on steroids after a relapse, and a stressful time in my life now. 
I have always been big on exercise and yoga, but am so weak now that it is impossible.  The steroids are being increased until my symptoms subside.  See Rheumatologist later this week.  Am so happy to have found this group.  Thanks.

"Hello I am so happy to find this group. I think I was living with pmr for about 2 years. Last year I ended up with bilateral frozen shoulders and the pain was unbearable. I have been in physical therapy for the last six months with great improvement and my Dr just diagnosed me with PMR 5 weeks ago. Was started on 15 MG prednisone and the pain was so much better and the stiffness in my shoulders is better as well.
My question is the fatigue seems even worse, at times it feels like I can barely function and now over the last 10 days extreme pain in my lower back. After reading on this site I switched to taking my dose at night for a week and that didn't change the fatigue and left me somewhat painful during the day so I switched back. I also have mgus.
Has anyone else had back pain ? Shouldn't the prednisone help this. Is extreme fatigue normal, I thought the prednisone would help this too.
Thanks

I am flying home next week on a 12 hour flight and the way feel now, even with airport assistance, I wouldn't be able to ""make it"".How much should I go up? And once Im back home and over the jet lag, how do I start tapering again? From square 1 , 1mg a month?
I realize this is a process and not many PMRers have a completely smooth journey but it's still quite disappointing when you have to go back up . I had programmed reminders on my phone and today it reminded me to drop to 12mg...Hahaha...

"Has anyone else experienced weight loss whilst taking Prednisolone?

I am eating normally and haven't changed my eating habits so I'm a bit baffled as I thought the indication was to gain weight on Prednisolone not  to lose it - not that I want to put on weight I might add!

"I have been on 6.5mg Pred for 3 weeks now.   Two and a half years with PMR.    I occasionally have a reasonable day, but more usually either fatigue, an inner trembling, pins and needles in my legs and feet, sometimes dizziness and sluggish brain, sometimes agitation.   I rarely have the energy or inclination to go out.
I dont have much pain, unless I carry shopping thats too heavy, or overdo the exercise, (which isnt often as I dont have the energy).  Or, as I found out a couple of days ago, after a gentle massage of my legs, feet, arms and hands. The next morning it was quite achy and painful.  
My question is:  does anyone else have these other side effects from Pred, or could it be that my Beta-blocker, Metoprolol, that is causing some of them?  
My quality of life is really not good at the moment.   Any comments or advice would be very helpful.

"I'm down to 6mg per day, having started at 10mg.  I owe it, or at least the smoothness of it to DSNS.  This was my second attempt at going from 7 to 6mg.  The first time I failed about half way through, and although that was disappointing, I went back up to 7 and felt better quickly.  I waited 5 days and then started over.  This time it worked.  I'll be starting down to 5mg again soon, but I have discovered a small consolation prize even upon failing;  Its that even if you don't make it through the cycle and have to go back, guess what?  You at least reduced the amount of pred in your system for that period.  So as I move to 5mg I know that even failure will have that much success.  For those of you on this bumpy road like me, that might be worth keeping in mind!  Good Luck!  Mark

"Hi all. Have not been on for a few months due to illness. Have been stuck on 13mg of preds for over a year but started to reduce very slowly back in September and managed to get down to 11mg at the start of March. Beginning of January picked up a nasty cough which led to a chest infection where doctor prescribed antibiotics but after 3 weeks the infection was still there. After a further course of anti's this seemed to clear the infection apart from a slight tightness across the chest but very little coughing and slight pain on my right side which I put down to coughing to hard and damaging a rib or something. Doctor sent me for an x-ray to make sure all was clear but then got a phone call to say that there was a 2cm patch on the right upper lung (the slight pain is on my left). I have no other symptoms of the big “C” such as lose of breath, appetite, loss of weight or constant coughing but being a complete pessimist I am fearing the worst. Have upped my pred to 15mg to help with the additional aches and pains you get from reducing as I feel I cannot cope with both. Am seeing a consultant next Tuesday which still seems a long time away and my mind is playing all sorts of tricks on me at the moment. Thanks for listening as it has helped no end just writing it down. Good luck with your own problems and may they all be little ones.

"I'm a new contributor, but I have been finding some of the coments on this forum really informative.  I've been on Prednisolone since August for PMR, starting with 20mg, had to go back to maximum dose after the first monthly reduction, now on 7.5 and suffering from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which started when I was put on blood pressure meds in January.  I stopped taking the ramipril a month ago, but now am having very painful and swollen fingers...all except the little finger which is normal.  Reading on here about 'flares' caused by too soon a reduction of the steroids I have checked back to see what dose I was taking when I felt quite comfortable, and it is the 10mg dose I was taking in January.  Would it be a good idea to go back to that dose and how long should I stay on it before reducing by, say, 1 mg monthly?

"Hi about 2.5 weeks ago, on adive from Eileen, I upped my dose to 15 for a few days then dropped back to 12 which was a bt above where the flare hapened. All went well - it really helped.
The shortly affterwards, due to a bereavement,  I had to do a car journey (as a passenger) from the south of Enland to Scotland. I didn't feel  too bad after the journey there and while I was in Scotland. However was in dreadful pain after the journey back. That was Tuesday and it has not settled at all - in fact has got worse on the whole. I'm feeling nearly as bad as I did shortly before I was diagnosed.
So- I am tempted to try clearing the inflammaion out with a few days higher dose but I worry about any negative effects from too much yo yo ing as I did that s recently.
If I try a higher dose for a a few days what should I go up to and what shoud I drop t?
Are thee any other ways of tackling this - e.g. is there anything to be gained from taking a double dose one day? I did that before - not because of a flare but because I was crossing time zones. My GP advised it and said it wouldn't do any harm on a one off.
Any thoughts gratefully received.

"I know that jaw pain can be an indication of GCA. But I'm fairly confident that is not what I have. For the last month I have been experiencing a tremendous amount of jaw pain on my right side. What happens is I wake up in the morning with jaw pain and it stops hurting within about an hour or two. Since that's the only symptom I have i assume it's from me grinding my teeth while I sleep. Here lately the pain has continued throughout the day and it's gotten to the point where it's difficult to eat I even feel it in my ear. I have an appointment next week with my dentist. This isn't the first time I've grinded my teeth at night, I've just never had the jaw pain like this. So I have tried the mouth guards before and have had no success keeping them in my mouth when I sleep. So that is really not an option for me.
All this being said my question to all of you is this: Is it at all possible that my jaw pain could be a PMR pain instead of from grinding my teeth?

"Hi everyone. I've been lurking here since my diagnosis in early december last year and first of all I'd like to thank everyone for their input. I've found the advice here really useful for understanding and taking charge of this condition.
Along with the predisone I've been prescribed Oméprazole, which according to my GP is for my stomach/digestion. I've had no problems in this regard apart from very occasional slight heartburn which I can easily live with, and I've read on the internet (so it must be true!) that this drug has some very unpleasant side-effects. Does anyone have any experience of this drug? I live in SW France - is it prescribed back in the UK (or anywhere else for that matter)? Personally I'd sooner take as few drugs as possible (definitely getting old!). Any advice would be most welcome.

"I am a 79 year old female who was very active and healthy a few years ago.  I don't drive so walked everywhere in my small Oregon town, took yoga twice a week, walked the dog daily, and danced every chance offered. 
September 2014, GP Dr. gave me Levofloxacin (also know by other names) for possible long term pneumonia.  I took it for two or three days and could not climb the stairs, lost control of my leg muscles.   Dr. noted that the drug seemed to trigger RA.  There was a lawsuit on this drug, which I/she was not aware of at the time.  Then I had all the bad effects of this drug including a rotator tear during a CTScan, difficulty walking, night sweats, weight loss of 20 lbs over a few months.  I lived on 800 mgs of Ibuprofen a day for pain for a year.  I was given Steroid shots to the shoulder and knees in 2015 by orthopedic surgeon.
January 2016, new GP Dr. suggested  Prednisone.   I started at 15 mgs and felt wonderful and could walk the dog again.   Months later, after blood tests and scans, July 2016, new dr. stated that I had PMR.  I reduced dosage too soon a couple of times.  5 mgs too low so I have been advised to stay at 6 mgs for a few months.
In addition to PMR, I have bursitis in my left hip and use a cane to relieve pressure while walking.  Also osteoporosis of both knees, the right one needing immediate replacement, damaged several times thru the years.  I am awaiting confirmation of a surgery date in April.  I am able to walk after the steroid shot fades by icing the knee several times a day and wrapping it up so that it will not fall apart.  I worry about my age and whether the knee will be difficult to heal because of prednisone use or the presence of PMR.

"I am interested to know how much you all ignore, or not, the background discomfort?  For me it is a continuous slight burning sensation in the back of thighs and upper arms which I ignore, (since coming down from 12mgs). The weekness and muscle stiffness is there too but again I just ignore it. Today my hands are tender and stiff, probably payback from gardening!  As I see it a flare is something that would be a lot more painful than that and looking back I think I mistook over doing it for the much heralded 'flare'  so putting my dose up a notch for a while. in retrospect the markers didn't alter significally.  I think I read that you always up your dose to reduce all 'pain'...is that correct Eileen? Am I right in then thinking it's a 'dance' between reducing the steroids at the expence of a little discomfort but that this doesn't prolong the PMR?
(Diagnosed feb 2016, started at 40mgs now at 8mgs...just)
I would like to pass on that since getting the enteric coated pred, I have been able to get off Ranitidine, initially omeprazole, with no more indigestion which was quite severe before. So one cost offsets the other with fewer pills and side effects!

"Hi all,
I hope you are all doing ok / as well as can be!!!
some of you may remember me but just to give some history, I was started on 25 mg prednisolone in July 2016 which gave me a good amount of relief but the GP after a week gave me 30mg, the Rheumatology dept immediately in the next 2 weeks reduced to 25mg and then I've been reducing slowly, now at 10mg, but pain started at the 14-12 area of reduction and at 10 mg it's really bad after being so comfortable for went to the Rheumatology dept this week, they want me to continue to reduce as they want me off prednisolone. I am also on Plaquenil for sjogrens, have autoimmune hypothyroidism (not medicated)as bloods normal at present. I have had two episodes of posterior vitreous detachment since August too.The Rheumatology dept want me to try azathioprine soon too,, as he said with the pain and sleep quality poor he thinks I have fibromyalgia too, but I think the pain is from reducing the prednisolone. 
I have done my first plane journies since diagnosis, and I wonder if that has thrown me out re the pain control 5 hour each way. The doctors have never been convinced re pmr just the GP that put me on the steroids, who has now left.
I've had a second opinion too.
I tried to go back to work too, and managed 7 weeks and increased my hours steadily on a phased return and only got up to 8.5 hours clinical my shifts should be 11.5 and can't have phased return again. I have another mouth procedure for implants in 11 days so will still be off work for that. 
I had a HR appointment this week and occupational Health appointment on Wednesday so really struggling, pain fatigue at home let alone work. I have 1  year to go in April before retirement I will be 54 in April. 
This is not how I wanted to finish my career. Just really struggling at the moment, I hurt if I rest I hurt if I move.
Really sorry to go on just feel lost ATM. 
Take care all of you.

"Hi all
I am feeling really disappointed right now. I have had supposedly PMR
since March 2016. Ihave come down to 7mg last 3 months cant seem to get below 7mg, and on methaxatrate for 6 months 25 mg.
My esr and cpk are still high have not come down. Now I have been diagnosed with fibrosis of the liver.
My question is this a result of the horrible methaxatrate? This drug has done nothing to improve my condition. Why has my rheummy insisted that I go on this drug. He now wants to take me off and wants to start bio treament which invloves some injection once a week.
I now have to see a liver specialist as concerned. Can this be reversed?
I don't know what to do anymore. He still does not believe its PMR but cant really diagnose anything else after extensive tests upon tests.
I feel like coming off everythjng and see what happens. ..

"I haven't been posting much lately, too busy keeping my appointment diary up to date! I'm having so many investigations at the moment that there isn't time for much else.
Following my PET scan in May, my rheumy decided that I needed to see a haematologist to check on inflammation on my spine spotted on the PET scan. I'm currently waiting for appointment letter for a further full body scan.
Next is a bronchoscopy to check my lungs, there is still crackling and something there since pneumonia during August. My voice has also got more and more hoarse and tight, in addition to being quite out of breath. That's scheduled for 1 December. They will also check for TB. I had a skin test, but had no reaction, no doubt masked by the pred.
I found out that if you have latent TB, methotrexate can activate it. Of course, I had 6 months of Methotrexate until I could no longer cope with the side effects.
Then I saw my gastroenterologist for my 6 months check up. She had warned me before that she might request a liver biopsy, and she said she now wanted this to go ahead. Although my liver enzymes are mostly good, one enzyme is not and she wants to have this done, as she says that there are too many uncertainties about my health and once you have an autoimmune illness, you could get liver immune disease. My liver is already fatty. Its also a good time to do it, as I've managed to taper the pred down to 15mg, so it won't mask any symptoms as much as it would do on a higher dose. This is scheduled for 5 December.
Also coming up mid December is a scan on a nodule on my lung.
That's it at the moment, I think!
I've managed to taper to 15mg pred, which is the lowest I've been since GCA started 2 years ago. I don't feel particularly better, I'm still very fatigued and rest/sleep a lot. I've still got a horrible round face and am still very overweight, a bit of a vicious circle though, I'm too exhausted to exercise or walk any distance, so am not using up many calories.
I manage to get out for my weekly art group and the odd brief outing to the shops or lunch with friends, but really, life is not very exciting right now.
And...I'm going to the Chertsey Support Group Christmas do on 6 December (the day after my liver biopsy, so may hobble in!) and really looking forward to that.

Then they came back today, only worse and since I had taken the higher dose in am and the lower in pm it didnt work and now Im in agony with itching, burning and total redness and welts all over. Nothing new in diet, nothing new in house and am wondering if one can develop an allergic reaction to the prednisone.

"I think I'm a pretty classic PMR case. Started on 15mgs in September 2009 and after a bumpy start the symptoms started to reduce in November. December's bloods showed my CRP down from 36 to 5 ( :D ) my ESR has always been normal. I've now cut down to 12.5mgs and going on to 10mgs on 1st Feb. So far, so good. Being an avid reader of this site (especially during my enforced hibernation due to snow!) I'm rather coming to the conclusion that PMR is here to stay - I haven't read of anyone having PMR and eventually coming off steroids and getting back to normal. My logic says that if you've recovered from PMR and are totally off steroids, you wouldn't bother posting on this site, my common sense however is telling me that the Doctor and Consultant are keeping quiet about the chances of me recovering completely. Any reassurance would be great but if its likely its here to stay then my plans to visit Machu Picchu for my 65th birthday (I'm 63 at the moment) might have to be brought forward or reappraised.

"I look like a newbie to this site but I have had PMR since 2007 – with two major flares both times when I have managed to get down to 2mgs steroids.  I have had to re- register for this site( was Gillb) as I couldn’t manage to change my e mail address – don’t know whether technology frustrates me more than PMR – but oh yes I do – definitely PMR!!
At a regular 6 monthly rheum appt in January this year, the Dr asked me to increase my steroids from 2mg to 3 mg and then have another blood test after two weeks, as he had noted that my CRP was creeping up again (16 at that stage).  He showed me a graph indicating the gradual rise and the fact that this had happened back in 2014 when I had a previous flare.  I must admit I was most impressed by his approach. At the time I was feeling great -was walking 1/2hour daily.  I was feeling good in myself – had lost the fat jaw line, my hair was looking healthy and was maintaining some sort of style.  I was able to do all I wanted to – we had had a good Christmas with lots of family activities.  I had noticed that I was a bit slow to wake up and get going in the mornings but I had no reason to rush – I have learnt over the years to pace myself and be good to myself!! So I was quite taken aback by the indication that things might not be as good as I was feeling.  Unfortunately I never made it to the two week blood test!  A week and a half later I experienced an evening when I felt extreme cold and felt terrible.  I went to bed with two duvets and blanket and slept 12 hours – I limped around the next couple of days – not feeling quite right but nothing I could put my finger on – was I sickening for flu – I couldn’t believe it was PMR related – I didn’t have any stiffness exactly or pain.  That is until after the weekend when it hit me hard – right back to full PMR – pain and stiffness across my scapulas and neck, couldn’t put one foot infront of the other etc. etc. etc.  I managed to get a blood test right  away and an emergency GP appt who increased my steroids to 10mgs.   By the next day I couldn’t even walk across the bedroom, or get down the stairs.  Two days later I was in so much pain the GP increased the steroids again to 20mgs and oh for relief again -  with adequate pain relief and the steroid increase I am finally on the mend again!!
The reason for this discussion is to ask how you all monitor how you are feeling?  Do you have any indication if a flare up is imminent?  I have discussed this with my family who agree I was really good before this flare BUT I had noticed increased morning lethargy – just didn’t relate it to PMR. I don’t have any real stiffness in the mornings once the steroids are suppressing the inflammation so I can’t monitor increased stiffness.  At present I am keeping a score out of 10 at bed time, as to how I am feeling. It depends on the time of day when I note the score as one day I was feeling really good and went to the shops and then had to come home and sleep as felt so awful -  I don’t need to spell it out to you all – was just wondering if anyone had any great way of actually taking notice of how they were progressing in their recovery.  I have always reduced on the dead slow method and try not to think too much re the amount of steroids I am taking, as I feel one can get so hooked up on medication and wondering if I should be reducing more quickly or more slowly.  I know I am in for discussion with the rheumatologist as to whether I should go on to methotrexate this time of reducing, but have held off this discussion until the brain fog has gone and I am on way down again!  I am meantime taking note of all your comments.  Thanks for all your input to this forum.

"i usually take 5mg of steroids at 8am as instructed. Have been on steroids for three years. Varying from 40 to 10, back to 20, now down to 5. Latest blood tests show zero ESR results, but from 2am I am in constant pain until about 2pm. Could I take the steroids at night instead? 
Any help would be appreciated as I am exhausted!

"I'm delighted to find this discussion forum and realise that I'm not alone!  I've really enjoyed reading all your comments - thank you, what a great comfort.  
I was diagnosed three weeks ago, after getting rapidly worse over a two month period, I'm 55.   It certainly gets a bit scary feeling almost paralised first thing in the morning and struggling to haul yourself out of bed while in pain, getting dressed and trying to get the body into action was a real challenge (needing help from my husband or kids to put on my socks -as this was impossible, sooo frustrating!)
I'm now on 15mg of predmisolone which made an almost immediate difference, however, last 3 days and lower back pains again!  Doc appointment on Monday - should I request an increase in dosage?
I wanted to ask about exercie, I walk for an hour every day which is fine but really miss my Callanetics class (haven't been brave enough to go back yet)  Has anyone any experience of Callanetics with PMR or Yoga recommendations and benefits?
Many thanks in advance.

"I'm wondering if there are other conditions that closely resemble PMR. I've been diagnosed with it and was on 10 mg for two months and felt great. Them down to 7.5 for a month and still felt good. Finally reduced to 5 mg for two months and then nothing. Whatever I had came back and now 5 mg doesn't seem to help. Upped my dosage to 6 mg against doctor's orders, and still super tired and stiff and achy. Just wondering if my test results would also fit for fibromyalgia or something else-- or if I need to up my dose to 8mg or higher to jumpstart my recovery.

"I saw a show about an Australian man wno had an autoimmune disease (Uticaria something or other). He went on a veggie/fruit ""fast"" for 30 days while reducing his prednisone dosage. He lost lots of weight, had no flair-ups and reduced his pred from 20mg to 0 gradually and feels wonderful. He was under Dr's care.
Question: Is this another hyped up, crazed, look-at-me-I-made-a-movie theory? Or is there really something behind this?

"Hello everybody. So glad I have found this forum. I am a retired 69 year old who has had PMR for 13 years on and off and it has been generally well-managed. Last August I had a flare-up and was put on prednisolone 15mg tapering dose. In December I caught a virus which put me into bed for three weeks and has resulted in extreme exhaustion which I am still trying to deal with. If I go out I have to use my car, and limit myself to just a few errands. If I go away for a visit to friends I am bed bound with exhaustion for several days on my return.  There is a 36 week waiting list to see my rheumatoligist who has been very supportive over the years. Any ideas on how I can get back to normal? I am a usually fit active person who loves life.

"I have purpura on my arms caused by bleeding under the skin. Most of them seem to be in long lines so look like I have been scratched by a cat while others vary in size from small dots to nearly a centimetre in diameter. They also itch and then sometimes break open, although the itching may be something else and the broken skin may be due to me scratching although I try not to. I have been on pred for PMR since January. Does anyone else have similar symptoms? My GP did not know what is causing it but plumped for the steroids. The purpura slowly fade and then new ones suddenly appear, one minute they are not there and the next time I look new ones have arrived. They are reddish to start with then fade and then disappear.

"Hi again, Im having an awful flare, ribs, shoulders, back groin etc all painful and currently at the 10 mil daily dose of pred. Eileen hoping you see this as I am wondering how much to up the dose, also the pills here in US have the slit so if I cut in half should I then cut again, then Ill be left with pieces. I only have 5 mil pills.
Cannot see Dr or get any help until next week. Also I have been taking 7&1/2 mil in the am the other 2&1/2 at dinner so not sure if I should start taking it all at once but that never worked any different, I think I need to go up but not sure how much to go up.

"My journey with PMR & GCA started in December, 2015, by February, got down to 11mg preds a day, after starting on 60 because of the GCA.  In the meantime I have also been diagnosed with severe degenerative arthritis in my lower lumbar with spurs as well.  I suffered extremely bad sciatica and had nerve blocks on both sides which has helped on the left, but I still have extreme pain on the right side but in my buttock area and spreading around into the front.  I cannot stand up for any length of time owing to this pain.  I also have weakness and pulsating pain all around the centre of  my lower lumbar area.  I have trouble getting up as it catches and when it is severe cannot sneeze, or even breathe easily for the pain.  On my latest blood test my markers were up again, from 2 to 34, so I guess part of this is a flare up.  I was put back onto 25mg pred for a week, which immediatley gave me some relief.  However after 3 days all the pain was back and I have reduced back to 20mg as my doc wants me to.  I understand that this dosage should control the PMR, but are there any exceptions out there?  I have put on weight with the meds, so I know this is not helping my back.  I have an appointment with a neuro-surgeon but cannot get in for another 2 months.  So I guess what I am asking is what type of pain is usually experience with PMR, is it really intense (the pain in my right buttock is there all the time and is so constant and intense it is like something is pushing it along all the time (hard to explain)and it wraps around to the front.  Whereas the pain in my lower back is more touchy, pulsating etc. and mostly with movement.  I have also been put on the pain killer Targin and panadol osteo.  Thanks for reading and look forward to your feedback.

"Hi- I started  a thread earlier today about having an atypical presentation which went undiagnosed for years but since this is a totlaly different question I thought I'd do a new post.
Basically I was started on 20mg which made me feel very well to the point I'd hardly know I had the illness. Intially reductions went well. if I had a blip I could easily relate it to overdoing things.
Once i got under 12 or so I started to feel slightly less well - though i did wonder if that was also something to do with the start of winter. Persisted with a slow reduction - did feel a little of the morning stiffnes creep in but not too bad. At 10 a had a flare which I think was causes by the central heating packing in - so not too worried and it didn't last long.
Then I had another one which was not so dramatic but without feeling dreadful I wake up every morning feeling i have PMR again.. the symptoms are relatively mild and they do usually  wear off as the day goes on but not always.
I went back up to 12 again but it hasn't really helped
Anyway - I have seen things on the froum saying you should aim for the lowest dose you can function on - which indicates I should persist with the slow reduction.
However lately I have also seem the opiinion that you should aim to feel as well as you did on the starting does. In fact I think I read that in quite a recent post from Eileen.
Just looking for any thoughts. I felt great at 20 or even in the highter teens but obviously can't stay at that forever or even for a long time

"Hi - as per the title I have had this undiagnosed for 5 or 6 years. Finally it hit me like a truck and I got diagnosis and medication just over a year ago. My experience is not unlike that of Eileen H who is an expert on this forum.
Anyway my exxperiences of coping have been a bit differnt to some - having had my family fairly late in life i still had a child at primary school as well as a job when i first got the condition!
That's just by way of introduction - my question at the moment is this. Having had the condition for years I now have the symptons under control but I know it is still very active - I am having to be super careful with tapering and have had a few set backs.
Is there a known link between age at onset and the amount of time it hangs around? Or perhaps a link between having the conditon untreated for a long time and the time it takes to go into remission or to get off steroids. I'd be interested both in any research anyone knows of and of course personal experiences.
Thanks for reading.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in Sept 2015; started on 20mg Pred, and managed to get down to 6mg; Dr had me going down 1/2mg at a time every month or so. I am also Diabetic and the Pred was doing bad things to my sugars, so on top of Metformin he had put me on Glipizide, which was doing the job quite well. Once I got down to 5mg Pred, my symptoms began coming back, very very slowly. During this time, I had 2 unfortunate falls, the 2nd one down a whole flight of stairs!! I broke 2 ribs in the falls, and my tailbone and was a mess of hurting for a good 2 months. The falls were last Oct & Nov 2016. Looking back now, I think the ""stress"" to my body from the falls could have made the flare up return; but because of all the pain I was in from the inuries, I didn't notice the PMR sysmptoms coming back right away. So this week I had more Labs and my CRP was high 6.78 and ESR near the high range at 19. The Dr has started me back to 10mg, and to let him know within a few days if it helps and or not, he will go higher if needed. He said once I get the pain and symptoms under control, we can work down from 10mg doing the 1/2mg at a time reduction. My question is; do you think the stress of my falling and the pain of that could have set off a flare of the PMR.......and do you think I should be seeing a rheumatologist and not just my regular PCP? He did tell me he did some further reading up on PMR before I got to my appointment, and that's how he decided how to handle the treatment. Your advise would be very helpful. I am 67 and still working full time ( although it is difficult to get through a whole week sometimes)....but  I will be retiring on June 30 of this year, and just cannot wait. I am not very active, but would like to start going back to the pool and getting limbered up again....I haven't been since my 2 falls last year. I do have other health issues, heart disease ( I had a heart attack at age 47, as well as Diverticulosis and have had part of my bowel removed a few years back.   Thank You

"My 78 ear old husband has HypoThyroidism, just been diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Both long standing. Even the latter, as we've suspected that for years. BUT he's incredibly unwell. Lost 1.5 stone in two to three months, to the delight off his respiratory consultant. Now he can't stop sleeping, is 'weak' and stopped. Seems to have he'd 10 years in a month. I am seeing the practice manager at the surgery in the morning. They've not been medicating the HypoThyroidism correctly. Trawling through the diary of last four months I came across mention of PM b one of the doctors. So I've looked it up and it ticks a lot of boxes. He's had occasional drenching night sweats and mild temperatures. Also, feels col a lot - probably that's the thyroid. Now, here's my questions. Can it creep up an the suddenly get full blown? Can the fatigue be all consuming? His age is about right. Problem is that he has a faulty heart valve having had one repaired six years ago, and arthritis in the wrists. He's due an injection for that, this week. Any pointers gratefully accepted, or am I just thrashing around looking for answers?

"Hi,
I have had PMR for 2 & a half years, I am aged 52, currently on 10mg pred per day and would appreciate any comments / thoughts on the following.
1. I sometimes forget things, like when driving how to get to my destination even although I know it well or I have left keys in car or front door keys in the door outside. Anyone else come across this ?
2. I have had to give up work as I cannot concentrate and am too tired, again am I being a wimp or anyone else had to do this ?
3. I find it difficult to get a full nights sleep and often have not very nice dreams, is it just me ?
4. I try to walk 2 miles each day (on flat ground) some days I feel fine and on others this tires me and hurts. Anyone else feel like this ?
5. When I do anything that requires exertion (housework) often I get horrendously sweaty even after only a short period, is this common.
any advice anyone can give would be really appreciated as even with all the great help from my doctor and hospital consultant I still feel very confused about PMR and kind of feel either isolated or that I am just not trying hard enough.
if you have read this far thank you for doing so. George from Kirkcaldy.

"so, after 3 years of PMR, and some good and bad tapering experience getting down to 7-1/2m from 15-10m, it has been mostly a bad idea to taper at all, pain fatigue-wise...so why not just stay at 9-10m? Seems so many people have tapered all the way down to 3 or 1 and then flare and have to go back to 10...so, with all the ups and downs over 3-10+ years, why mess with it. I am not hearing any major pitfalls from the prednisone, with a few exceptions. I know the doctors don't like us to take it at all, but we must.
If 7m is the ""normal"" production of our adrenals...increasing under stress to 9-10....is taking 9-10m all the time so bad? If you have PMR you are stressed all the time!

"I was just wondering if anyone else had been diagnoised with PMR and then been told it has possibly moved into Rheumatoid Arthritis.  It's been four months since I was diagnoised with PMR by my Rheumatologist on November 24, 2014.
To recap: I had all the classic symptoms of PMR the end of September, 2014 with shoulder pain and stiffness, couldn't raise my arms over my head, took two hands to hold a cup of tea, severe pain and stiffness in the backs of my legs to the point I couldn't sit, could barely walk at times or get up from a sitting position, or out of bed, etc. and the only thing that helped was prednisone. I went through tons of labs and blood work, x-rays, worked with my internist, saw a neurologist, and finally the rheumatologist in November 2014 which resulted in the diagnosis.  I was put on four infusions of prednisone in December, then started at 20 mg. daily of prednisone and 10 mg, of methotrexate.
I'm currently at 12&1/2 mg. of prednisone and 20 mg. of methotrexate daily and doing really well at the moment with the pain and stiffness gone for now and only dealing with the fatigue. At my check up with the Rheumatologist on Monday she told me that she thought due to the lab work, etc.in late February she felt that I was really leaning more to Rheumatoid Arthritis than PMR. I see her again in two months when they will do more blood work. I  just wondered if this had happened to anyone else here.  Any information about the differences in the two, deciding factors for diagnosis, etc. will be greatly appreciated.  I know nothing about RA and was just starting to somewhat understand PMR.  I was tested for RA in the early testing last October, but no positive results at that time.
Thanks for your help!!

"Having started my PMR journey 10 years ago and now having experienced my 2nd flare up - having reduced to 2mgs eachtime -  I feel I have a lot of experience but little knowledge or understanding of how PMR works it havoc.   However I am once again trying to be positive !!!! although difficult at times - and I wanted to offer a few tips on self help.  My background is an Occupational Therapist so I have spent many years offering advice on goal setting and aid provision to be independent- both which have been invaluable to the improvement of PMR symptoms.  So I thought I'd share a couple of obvious things but which some people may not intially think about especially when the brain fog/pain fog has a hold. Forgive me if I am speaking to those who have already worked this out for themselves.
?1.  Wear loose fitting warm clothes but with a bit of colour or panache to brighten yourself up - I have two pairs of Supermarket trousers with elastic waist and loose legs that are fairly smart but are not my usual wardrobe type of trousers - but I can pull them on over my feet and pull up and down easily for toileting.  I have also lived the last month in a cope of extra sized loose jumpers - warmth and easier over the head when those shoulder hurt so much.  I top this off wih a scarf of varying colours ( probably as the mood dictates- but hopefully to reflect my need to feel brighter). 
?2   A metre square of fleece material has become a comfort blanket - it is light and easy enough  to manage to get round my neck or shoulders whilst sitting or lying in bed - anything bigger i finds involves too much upper limb activity to get in position to help.
?3. Decant steroid tablets into a small pot before going to bed and leave in easy access alongside a  yogurt or something to eat - so that as soon as one rouses early morning one can take the food and steroids without having to try and get them out of the packets and also means you are aware enough when decanting the tablets to make sure you are taking the correct medication. 
?4  My final and best advice is to treat yourself ( if you have the finance - need about  £500)  to an inflatable bath cushion.  I was lucky enough to be working when I had my first bout of PMR and borrowed aids from work to help with the bath.   With my first flare up I spent me time at my mum's who had a bath cushion installed for her use, so I was able to share.  This time - after the indignity of my husband having to lift me in and out of the bath, I blew some savings and purchased my own cushion - it is wonderful - the relief of the warm water over my back and shoulders as I lie in a lovely bath without the fear of getting stuck in the bath is unmeasurable.  So if you are considering it - just go for it - I fully intend in a few weeks that it will go away in the bathroom cupboard to await my Mum coming on holiday or for when I get 90 and need more assistance.  Meantime I know how much better I will feel after a warm bath.
?Thanks to all who contribute on this forum - you have been amazing in your sharing of knowledge and support - Although I don't often contribute I always read the posts and have learnt so much from you all.  I am avidly reading all about the introduction of methotrexate into your medication regimes as now with a second flare up and the fact that I am likely to be on steroids for a lot longer, it is being suggested that that is the way I need to go - I have asked at present to wait until i can reduce again to at least 5mgs and then discuss - when I hope I will have had time to research and be more painfree and clear minded to make an informed decision rather than introduce another toxic drug into the system now without knowing too much about it - any advice for the forum will be appreciated - maybe methotrexate is the way forward.   I wait to see. 
Good wishes to all - watch the daffodils - spring is round the corner.  For those of us in the northern hemisphere that is!!

"Hi All, this is my first post on this forum, but I have been a steady follower since October 2016.  I'm a 62 year old man living in the United States and want to start by saying how helpful your posts have been.  They allowed me to essentially confirm a self diagnosis of PMR while waiting for my first rheumatologist appointment (took 3 1/2 months to get one due to high demand/low supply for rheumatologists).
I don't want to be too long winded, but would like to lay out my experience in hopes of helping others, as you all have helped me.  Here's a synopsis of my three, short-succession autoimmune events, which started on October 1, 2016:
Angioedema [Severe swelling of eyes and lips]  Had several days of this autoimmune issue.  Initially went to the hospital emergency room (ER) and was given IV steroids.  Twenty-four hours later symptoms seemed to have gone away, but then I developed very itchy palms and about 6 hours later angioedema swelling returned.
Urticaria  [Severe hives]  Woke up on 10/4/16 with welts over much of my body; feet were swollen and red, as well.  Again went to the hospital ER and was given another round of IV steroids.   Woke up on 10/6/14 with large welts basically everywhere:  upper arms, sides, back, chest, belly, back and front of legs, back of left calf, and bottoms of feet.  Over several days the welts moved around, but stayed with me for close to a week.  Met with an allergist on 10/5/16 to try to figure out what was causing the angioedema and urticaria issues--the doctor said we would probably never know.  Based on the severity and duration of my symptoms, he ruled out any typical allergic reactions such as to food, pollens, etc.
PMR.  The evening of 10/6/16, the first symptoms of PMR appeared--both of my shoulders all of a sudden became very sore and achy while just watching TV.  Had a very uncomfortable night sleeping.  Started out in the bed, but woke up about 2 hours later and then spent the rest of the night in a recliner chair.  My shoulders stayed very sore.  I woke up the next morning with my shoulders and arms very sore.  It was difficult to raise my arms, but this improved as the day went on.
Synopsis of the next several days:
- 10/8/16
   -- Woke up welt-free and feeling pretty normal
   -- Right wrist was a little painful
   -- Felt comfortable enough to go on a previously-planned 3-day out-of-town trip
   -- That afternoon right thumb became very painful, but was better before bed
Note:  At this point, full days tended to tire me, and my body become tingly and numb.  My head started to feel thick and my hearing felt numb.  This lasted several days.
- 10/9/16
   -- Early through the night left wrist and left arm really started hurting--any movement was painful
   -- Woke up a lot, but antihistamines I had been prescribed allowed me to go back to sleep
   -- Work up with arms and hands very sore
   -- Wasn't able to drive the car to go out to get coffee that morning
   -- Got better as morning progressed
- 10/10/16
   -- Around 1:30 a.m. (after 4 hours of sleep), woke up with right-hand finger knuckles ""on fire.""  Right shoulder was also very uncomfortable.  Due to the discomfort/pain, only got about an additional hour of sleep
   -- Upon getting up (6:15), right hand and arm were pretty useless and left shoulder was very sore.
   -- Right fingers could not be laid flat and middle finger was very swollen and sore
   -- Conditions improved as morning progressed
- 10/11/16
   -- Went to bed at 12:30 a.m. after getting back from 3-day trip.  Got up at 6:00 after a very uncomfortable night.  Shoulders and hands/fingers were very sore.  To get out of bed I had to slide on my back to let my feet down to the floor (couldn't use arms).  Couldn't raise arms at all without quite a bit of pain.  It was very difficult to open my medication container caps
   -- Had to ask my wife prepare my coffee
   -- Conditions improved as day progressed.  Conditions (shoulders/hands/fingers) started to return around 4:00 p.m.  It was painful to reach for and click my car seatbelt into place
- 10/12/16

Fast Forward on the Timeline:
- Between mid-October 2016 and my 2/1/17 rheumatologist appointment, my PMR symptoms went way down in intensity.  I would have occasional flares, but overall things became manageable, albeit pretty annoying.  I began sleeping much better, but each morning it would take from 1-3 hours after awakening before my body felt ""normal.""  A lot of tired/week legs and occasional sore shoulders.  There were certain shoulder motions that I just couldn't do.  My shoulder and arm muscles also felt weaker than before the start of the autoimmune issues.
- My rheumatologist is roughly 40 years old and is an awesome guy.  He was very willing to allow me to provide him my self diagnosis, in addition to going through my experiences/symptoms.  He agreed with my assessment of PMR and elected to put me on a year-long, tapered prednisone regimen.  The hope is for the PMR to burn itself out in a year's time.  My blood tests didn't indicate increased inflammation markers, but he said that that didn't mean I don't have PMR.  I told him that I imagined that my markers were probably very high the first half of October when I experienced lots of pain and discomfort.
- Prednisone.  He started me on 20mg for 2 weeks, followed by 17.5 for 2 weeks, which is where I'm at right now.  In future posts I can go over the full taper plan.
- Relief!  The prednisone has done wonders.  I'm able to get up and going each morning in 15-30 minutes and am now able to do many things that I hadn't been able to.  For the most part, pain and discomfort have gone away ... and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that any flareups are few and far between
Thanks for reading my story.

"A few days ago, Eileen referred to a gentleman that started a special method to taper pred. She couldn´t answer the original question about how it started. I couldn´t find her post now but I will try to answer the original question about how it started. I am the gentleman referred to and I made a time-out period at 5 mg during one year due to fatigue. When continuing I thought it must be easier to taper if the taper period was prolonged. I therefore tested the following method: one day new dosage, two days old dosage and then I repeated it once more. After six days, I took the new dosage for a period and next time I wanted to taper, I repeated this method. At the time (about 10 years ago), I was posting fairly frequently on the Northeast forum, so I posted my method there as I had been successful using it and wanted more people to be able to try it. Many other persons in different countries of the world tested it and mostly with success. Somebody started to call it the Ragnar method (Ragnar is my forename). I now just googled “Ragnar method” and got many posts from different forums. I hadn´t seen the healthunlocked forum, so I didn´t know that the method had been discussed there also.
After some time, Eileen et al extended the period for the tapering and developed a method. It was then called the DSNS (dead slow nearly stop) method, and even more people have been successful in tapering as the extended period was better for the body for many. I think that it is important to go very slow. To me, it was more important than getting off pred. As I was on 5 mg I thought I could just as well stay on that for a year as the fatigue bothered me very much. Now I have been off pred more than 8 years without having a flareup. By the way, I never had a flareup as I went very slowly. Eileen is doing a great job explaining how it works and she really has helped a lot of persons.
I have have had atrial fibrillation for many years. I therefore take 2 pills of Warfarin every day except Wednesday when I take 3. Yesterday I was at the hospital to test my blood. I got a sheet with the new value after having a blood test and I also get the three last values for comparison. I also get information that my medicine is Warfarin 2.5 mg and the weekly dosage is 37.50 mg. The average daily value is therefore 5.36 mg. With the new paper in my hand, I thought about the pmr/GCA tapering. I don’t need to cut my tablets because during the week, the dosage levels out to be 5.36 mg per day and I just take an extra tablet during one day. I thought this could be interesting to compare.

"I have been quiet but reading every post on here plus catching up on the old posts and all my questions regarding tapering, pacing, travelling ,etc., have been answered.
2 weeks ago, I had to travel from Spain, where I live, to Seattle to help take care of my 2 school age grandchildren. As pre Eileen, I traveled with airport assistance which was great, despite having a broken sacrum and pubis.I have had to drive again after 25 year which was stressful and the pain from the broken pelvis is quite bad, especially at night as can only sleep on my back which I am not used to so I haven't been getting quality rest for over two months, now.. But all in all, my PMR was under control and I had managed to reduce 1.25mgs a week successfully .I have been at 15mgs for a week now and was about to reduce another 1.25 when I woke up this morning with what seems to be full blown, untreated PMR. I don't think I over did any thing, either.
What can have happened? I know I've been tapering super fast due to the insufficiency fractures.I was planning to start the slow tapering when I got to 10mgs. The only thing I can think of to do is to stay a while at 15mgs
The pain from the fractures has not subsided at all after 2 months, in fact I am now in constant pain, not only when walking or lying on my side. Could a flare be caused by being in pain? I do take pain meds but not regularly ..I'd be a complete basket case if I took enough on a regular basis to ease this horrendous pain.

"I'm a 60yr old male diagnosed three years ago with Fibromyalgia. I'd had the FM symptoms for over 12 years. Recent reading, and educating myself to the symptoms of Giant Cell Arthritis & Polymyalgia Rheumatica, has me now wondering if my FM has been a misdiagnosis?
Twenty years ago I had a sudden onset of pain and immobility, starting with right thumb pain that spread rapidly to every arm and hand joint, and debilitating both arms within hours. Within a day I had left sided head pain, even causing excruciating episodes of pain deep within my left ear canal. I was treated as sera-negative poly arthritis by my GP who advised me to be admitted to hospital, and prescribed 40mg prednisolone daily for 8 months, which reduced over the following year. I wonder now if my FM symptoms are actually the ongoing residual symptoms of misdiagnosed GCA or PMR? Or even a combination of the three conditions? Now I don't know whether I should discuss my concerns with my GP or not? I'm genuinely not a hypochondriac at all, but more concerned that this is how I'll be categorised. Sorry for the lengthy post.
Any advice and comments welcome. Thank you.

"So I go to my Rheumatologist today, getting ready for him to give me my Prolia injection and he informs me that he will no longer treat me if I do not go off the prednisone. He has wanted me to taper by 2&1/2 mil every week and when I got down to 7&1/2 mil I had a terrible flare and went back up to 10 mil without asking him. Today he said that he wants me to taper by the 2&1/2 every three days until Im down to zero and  told him why, Im in alot of pain in the groin and shoulders and when I get to below the 7&1/2 my scalp begins to hurt. He said all of your blood work is normal therefore you dont need the pred any longer. I then explained to him that the Neur Opthomologist thinks I do need to be on it and he then tells me to have him take over my treatments, he was so rude and uncaring and now I dont know what to do. he thinks a year on the red is long enough and even went so far as to say  was addicted to a fake pain reliever. I am so upset and beyond knowing what to do. Needless to say I did not let him give me the injection, I was so angry to be treated like this that I just left. Now what do I do, find another Dr?

"I look back on my life and have, since a young child been diagnosed with bronchitus, pneumonia, excema, severe allergy to poison ivy. Then I got a severe flu-like disease at age 16. I think they called it Boston exanthus something. I got out of bed and fell to the floor. Severe pain everywhere. My mother had it at the same time and they told her she whould have arthritis the rest of her life and she did. I began to have severe allergies to everything that grows and expecially mold. Next i was diagnosed with asthma, at age 30, the Drs saying I was misdiagnosed as a child. I almost died when they did an allergy series on my back in an allergist's office.  Had 2 adrenaline shots right there. Next my husband and I both got a severe form of flu that knocked us both out for 3 weeks. He eventually recovered, but, I didn't for 3 years. They diagnosed Candidiasis, Chronic Fatigue and through all this I had arthritis, which I ignored for years. My husband ended up with Parkinson's and Dementia and I nursed him through all 10 years. My back had been bothering me for years and the Drs said arthritis...nothing new there. Then my kidneys fail for no apparent reason other than I'd been taken Advil for too long. The back pain was so bad, but, I couldn't take the time for myself. By the time I got to the surgeon I had no disc left at all..L6 or 7. I recover from surgery then my husband dies. Then I go back east to visit family in Connecticut and start sleeping and sleeping and having no energy, no appetite. Lose a quick 10 lbs in a month. Get home and get this awful shoulder pain. 
They start looking at Lyme (Connectcut in the woods for a month in a camper), Lupus (which would have shown up long before now), RA (no RA factor in blood tests, but, still not ruled out) and finally since inflammatory markers so high, PMR. Wow! Does anyone see a pattern here? Seems like auto-immune problems all through. I'm beginning to think the virus theory behind PMR, and other diseases, plus genetic predisposition are a cluea. I have 2 grandchildren from the same family with Type 1 diabetes (auto-immune) with absolutely no type 1 diabetes in any of the family, although they say it is genetic. Anyone had similar diagnoses or mis-diagnoses previous to PMR?

"Hi Ladies,
To all of you who have had trouble withe the hair thinning/hair loss side effect from taking steroids,I have found it is quite useful to use a shower comb with wide teeth instead of my usual brush. It does not pull and tug at the hair the same way a brush does,therefore any dry bits do not break off so easily.
In an earlier post I also said I take a folic acid tablet daily,which recently seems to be helping my hair.
Another tip,this time re weight gain.  I have not put on a huge amount of weight,maybe around 6lbs,so I did find my clothes tighter. Rather than go up a dress size,I bought some extendable buttons for trousers (you could also just move buttons along your waistband a bit) and some bra extenders for bras. We all know how expensive bras are,and also saves buying new clothes. ( maybe the downside is though,we all like new clothes!).
Hopes these tips help if you have not already tried them.

"I have been on prednisone for over 4 years for PMr.  WAs really diagnosed by my endocrinologist and have never had a successful rheumatologist encounter.  He sent me to a new one to get me off the prednisone (i have tried weaning over the years and get to a certain pOint and always flare and start over).  But my sugar is becoming an uncontrollable issue due to the pred.  So the new Rheumy started a taper as he didn't even believe the dIagnosis as my numbers were all in the low range, except my RA factor which was really high when I first went to see him.  So he sent me for head to toe xrays.  No real sign of any RA at all.  So we tapered from 15 down to 10 mgs and my sed rate and CRP started climbing.  He jumped right to prescribing Methotrexate and said he was gong to treat me for RA !  No more taper of pred as I would be in too much pain according to my numbers- MAYBE if the methotrexate works we can reduce some more, he said.  So I asked why treat me for RA if I have NO signs of any joint inflammaion and all my pain feels muscular.  he replied that the Methotrexate would treat any inflammation and my RA factor WAS high.  I have NOT filled the prescription due to all the side effects and I already have other compromised systems, stomach, kidney stones etc.  And the point to going to him was to get off prednisone and reduce my overall side effects from medication.  SO here's the questions; have any of you successfully used methotrexate to combat PMR - would it be worth the try do you think?  The side effects really put me off.  I am inclined to try another taper and see where my numbers and pain go before i add anything else.  Any advice?  Thanks!!

"Hi All
Feeling a littel up in the air this morning. Looks like my rheumy is not happy with the doctors PMR diagnosis and prefers to think it may be AS. He thinks I am too young for PMR. Wants me off pred quick due to Oestoperosis diagnosis and onto oesto drug for 5 years now. Can't diagnosis AS until I have another MRI scan which will probably not be until August. I'm on 20mg of pred and reducing 1mg a week. I can feel the aches coming back stronger into my neck and shoulders and am not sure what to do. 
I do feel I need to get off pred quicker but am scared it will bring all the pains back. I am not sure aboutt the osteo drug either. Can I take ibruprofin as well as pred? Maybe that will help with neck and shoulder pain whilst I reduce? 
I feel as if I should just shut up and get on with this. There is no diagnosis and I just need to do as I am told but waking every morning with a pain in my neck and shoulders is not good. I am not nearly as bad as others on here so maybe I am making mountains out of molehills and need to get back to the person who never complained and just got on with it. I hate this moany person I have become. I no longer can say 'yes I'm fine' to that question 'how are you?' I have to give them my medical history and I have to stop otherwise I will go mad!

"Dear All.
I am hopefully recovering from my PMR nightmare (Now on 2mg and counting) and having read many posts about the many sufferers being in the dark about their condition and whether they have PMR there was one aspect of my pre steroid condition that I am sure must be common to many sufferers.
I had mainly severe shoulder and knee pains and although taking painkillers to get through the day I was unsure whether to rest to relieve the pain or whether exercise would make things worse.
A hot bath had no beneficial effect and I am now of the opinion that if the muscle pains are PMR related then muscles will not be harmed by any exercise. It is my personal opinion and is not scientifically based that PMR muscle pain does not affect muscle strength but somehow causes pain in the joints when the muscles are exercised. If you can stand the pain a workout will not harm you.
I recall informing my consultant I am in excruiating pain with this (Pre steroid) condition but I could give you a good arm wrestle but would be in great pain in the process.
Best regards,
Jim

"As I have previously mentioned my story. I am in my late 40s have had suspected PMR since March 2016. Started on 30mg prednisone and have been taking methotrexate for 4 months 25mg. I am now down to 6mg prednisone. My rheummy has suggested 1 mg per month to taper down. He is eveutually going to place me on some bio drugs as the methotrexate isnt doing anything. My recent bloods showing my esr at 25 and cpk at 40. Recently i have been experiencing a lot of pain to the point where i feel i have been battered and bruised. Mainly my arms and leg muscles plus the stiffness My rheummy wont commit to PMR given my age. I have undergone every test under the sun to rule out anything else and he is still scratching his head.
He is one of the best here in Sydney Australia apparently. My question is could this be a flare up or could it possibly be withdrawl as i dont know the difference. Also yesterday I woke up with a sharp pain on the right side just near the ribs. I haven't been able to see my gp yet to see what this could be I am concerned as my liver test showed fatty liver and enzymes are raised although they assure me its not at a dangerous level.
I am feeling so down as I feel the past year have had little success getting to the proper diagnosis and also relief. I did have relief when on a higher dose of steroids but the doc is determined to get me off them.
Could you please.offer me some advise please.

"For those of you on low doses of Prednisone (under 10 mg?), how long did it take for your moon face to go away? Or, does it hang on? 
I'm currently on 14 mg and mine just keeps getting fuller, especially on my chin and neck area.  I feel like I have balloons under my chin.  Blah!
I was not overweight before taking Prednisone , but have now packed on 20 extra pounds, which I'm sure doesn't help.  I have so many different sizes of clothes in my closet, I could open up a thrift shop. Blah, again.
Have a good day, everyone!

"I'm almost 50 and I have already been on this forum about being newly diagnosed with PMR. Had a bone density scan last week and have been told that I have full blown Osteoporosis that is not (I'm being told) anything to do with the steroids I'm on. I am now worried that I have to get off the steroids that are currently controling the pain but on a high dose of 23mg it is not going to be quick. I am trying to see a specialist but am not sure who to see. Can my rheumatologist who I have seen for PMR (although not very regulaly) help or do I go and see the osteoprosis specialist? I feel as if I am falling between the cracks and being supported by no-one. Any thoughts would be good.

"Every few months it seems I strain some muscle in my side, mostly right side, or as now I strained the muscles on each side of my lower spine.  I'm pretty sure it muscle, not bone in this case (yes I do have arthritic lower back).  Do any of you have repetitive muscle strains that go on for a week or more?  Is this a part of PMR, or just out of shape?  This one is misery to me.  I can hardly stand up.  I took a little extra pred today, not sure it helped at all.

"very stressed for about 4 weeks, and didn't sleep much for that period. My darling daughter was going travelling and spending time in Turkey for a procedure for her husband. Meanwhile during the last 4 years have been working physically hard (over doing it and running on adrenalin). We had to finish the Reno before they left. Living on pain killers for the last 6 weeks before they left as I has injured my hand, but knew I had to stay on the job.
so I guess stress, no sleep and running on adrenalin....I hit a brick wall. Spent time in hospital, was on 10mg of Prednisole, morphine, TRAMADOL, Mobec....etc.
7 weeks ago , I was running up ladders, and seemingly fit.
Just on Paracetamol, Lyrica and Iboprfen. Some days are diamonds ....some days are worse than stone....

"My dad has been dealing with a horrible case of PMR and GCA since last  June, but diagnosed in August.  He started out at at 60 mg... only down to 40 right now.  We've been trying to taper slowly, but his flares are horrible.  The rheumatologists in his area are few and far between and negligent at best.  On the last doc's watch, dad diagnosed with heart failure and then severe osteoporosis, only diagnosed after 5 vertebrae fractures. 
I'm trying to figure out if the DSNS approach is how to reduce from such a high dosage or if you do this once you get down lower?  Any advice is appreciated.  This has been a nighmare.

"I have just been prescribed prednisolone last week and they are helping. However, I have experienced real problems in trying to get to sleep. Over the last two weeks I have not slept for practically 2 whole nights and also when I have a couple of hours and then wake up I am not able to go back to sleep.  The strange thing is that I am really feeling as tired as I should given the lack of sleep. I am managing to function ok the next day, although if this goes on for a much longer time I dont suppose that I will be very functional!  It may be that I am just getting used to the medication?  Has anyone else experience anything similar?

"I'm back , after the nightmare of a&e and being sent home after 24 hours being told I need to take 60 mg of preds just in case !!I then started a nasty cough . And you all gave me good advise .
However because they weren't convinced I had GCA I didn't want to take the steroid I opted to take if it got bad again . The pain began to subside within a day and I bacame worse with a nasty cough an temperature .Two days after leaving hospital I thought I would go to our walk in clinic which is about 9miles away . Booked in , seen by a nurse within 10 mins .Told to take a seat and wait . Kids running every wear .some laying out flat ,flushed in mum or dads lap . Older people looking already as though they had given up hope . 1 hour later My husband went up to desk and asked how long . ""She's not been written on the list yet , once she is on the list it will be 2. 5 hours at least .
Decided I would do my self more harm sitting in that type of environment than waiting to see one of my own gps .So 6 days later managed to see an emergency doctor who diagnosed me with bad chest infection, and now am taking some antibiotics .
Saturday did receive letter to see Rhumatologist this Thursday . Hopefully all will be well . But hope he will check out my diagnoses of PMR as have never seen a specialist in 2.5 years, and believe my own doctors are doubting their diagnoses now

Now he is on Enbrel and that is given by injection. He will be off steroids soon. We're both baffled as we thought steroids were a long term thing. I'm just look g for feedback. As far as I know Enbrel is not a steroid.

"I just turned 70 Jan 5.Last July I drove my truck and slide-in camper back across the country in a hurry because my grandson was in hospital ICU. The day after I got home I couldn't get out of bed my shoulders hurt so much. My MO has always push through pain or illness. I tried. I figured it was from driving a 1 ton Ford truck for 12 hours a day that caused it. Once I dragged out of bed I tried to get dressed. You men on this list haven' t the faintest idea what it's like to put on a bra with full-blown PMR! or a bathing suit, I wanted to go back to my water aerobics class (of 20 years). I pushed, I tried, used the hottub..nothing worked. I was worse. Six weeks later, I finally got in to see the GP. By that time I had gone through everything online and pretty much diagnosed myself with PMR. Fortunately GP came up with same diagnosis. Off to the rheumie, as you call them. Waited 6 more weeks. Asked GP to put me on Pred. He starte with 5, then 10 mg. Helped about 25%. Rheumie diagnosed PMR and I've had slight OA for 20 years, no surprise there. Then up to 15mg, nothing, then at 20 mg things were tolerable. That was middle of Nov.  On month later, ""we have to get you off this prednisone"".  What??!! I just got there. So when I tried to go to 17.5mg I felt so awful I couldn't get up. Asked to go back to 20 until at least after Christmas. I did.  Now she wants me down to 15mg then 10mg. Going to 17.5 put me in bed for 5 days. So fatigued and muscles not working. In fact, have no muscles...I took care of my terminally ill (Parkinson's) husband for 10 years..the last 5 with dementia. When he died I finally got to do what I wanted. I bought a truck, camper (like we did together) and traveled back east to see relatives. I live in Idaho, USA, but, am originally from Connecticut.  I had two great trips until the last when all I wanted to do was sleep 12 hrs a night and lost my appetite completely (very unlike me). Then came the pain in July.   So...sorry long a story...I find this forum somewhat depressing. Most people think I am in my 50's and I've always been strong and tough. Now I am a jellied mass of inertia after 6 mos. Do I
have to give up my life again? to this autoimmune disease, prednisone problems and slowing down?  How many years do these Drs think I have left to live a decent quality of life? Sounds like this disease will take the good years I have left to be free, never mind the care of my husband which took 10 years. Is there hope if I try to exercise again. Even doing the laundry or going to the store has me down for the next day.  Should I just grin and bear it and go to bed for a week every time there is a reduction? Please, someone help me find a good end to this. I don't know how to live only in the present. I want to look forward to good times ahead, not more slow down.  I have wanderlust, cabin fever and apparently depression and the worst winter Idaho has ever seen.  Need some validation from people who understand. I have been the universal mother, everything to everybody, for so long, my grown sons and families are not ""getting it"", being so busy themselves. Thanks for listening and this forum.

"After an ER visit on Thanksgiving night for severe headache and PMR symptoms, my internist arranged a rheumatologist consult for me in mid-December.  Hospital ESR was 35 CRP was 14.  I was given 15mg prednisone and sent home.  Internist followed up with a  me drop dose pack.
Rheumy suspected GCA because of headaches, jaw claudication and PMR symptoms, some double vision, started me on 60 mg prednisone.  I had a TAB 5 days later, which was negative.  Rheumy decreased dosage to 40 mg but said if symptoms came back to go back to 60 mg.  They did, 2 days later.  I upped the dose to 60, as instructed, and continued for 2 weeks.  After some horrible side effects, mostly insomnia and sweating, as well as exhaustion, I tried going to 55mg.  I am holding at that so far and will repeat blood work tomorrow, seeing Rheumy on 1/10.
I wish I knew if this is really GCA.  After the quick taper to 40 proved disastrous, I'm afraid, but this much prednisone is killer.  I know it's doing its job, but I would kill for sleep and am exhausted and grouchy all the time.  Not to mention I'm freezing out everybody in the house.  Can't wait to see Rheumy, I didn't know a negative biopsy is inconclusive, not really negative.  
Looking for for any and all experiences.

"Good Morning to you. I'm sure this subject has been covered in the past but I'm struggling to find the information ('can blame the steroids for that;-)) Since diagnosis of PMR at the beginning of December 2016 I've successfully tapered down to 19mg (from 30, I started on a high 'ish' dose as it was later realised that I'd started with GCA at the end of September). I usually take all of my tablets in one go after breakfast at 8am, which has generally worked well. I have found the last few mornings I've felt stiff and sore and it takes me a while to get going. I'm wondering if maybe taking 12mg in the morning and 7mg at bedtime (based on my current dosage) starting tomorrow might be the way to go? Is tomorrow likely to be a problem as my body will get less pred than it expects? I'm 53 and still working part time so maybe I should start on a day when I don't work? Any ideas, suggestions and experiences would be hugely appreciated. Rose

"I've had PMR for coming up two years and am now down to 5mg (from 30mg at the beginning). I'm now pretty much symptom free apart from mild aching shoulders at night and occasional bouts of tendonitis (had to have a cortisone  jab in a finger the other day!).
I normally take my dose at about 5.00 in the morning but a couple of days ago I found my pill next to my bed at 5.00 in the evening and realised that I'd forgotten to take my dose. So, I took it then (12 hours late) and took my dose as normal at 5.00 the next morning. The point is that although I missed a dose I did not feel any worse and I'm wondering if my PMR has gone. I know that I cannot just stop or taper too fast (I reduce at half a mg per two weeks) but how can I know when or if my adrenal glands are kicking in and if they are can I taper more quickly without risking symptoms of prednisone withdrawal or even worse some sort of flare-up?

"As the initiator of Club Zero in the Northeast forum, I think that we should formally say that we have a Club Zero on this forum for those who have reached 0 Pred and that  pmr and/or GCA has gone into remission.
The last one I have seen that wanted to join Club Zero is John, and I welcome you to this club. We hope that you will continue posting so other members can see that it is possible to come to 0. I myself have been free from pred since December 2008 and I haven´t had any flares. I keep on posting as I think that those who are struggling to reduce are happy to see that there is a possibility to come to 0. At last I want to caution that from 5 mg and below, you have to take it easy so you don´t have a flare. If you do have it at such a low dosis, it will probably take longer for you to get to 0 than if you followed the DSNS method all the time. Good luck to all and we expect you in Club Zero.

"The last few days have been awful. What am I to do . As I have said before been on steroids now for some 2.5 years . Have now got down to 6 mg of prednisalone which has been a hill of up and down proportions after a flare because I dropped to quickly .
Ended up in Luton and Dustable hospital known for its good eye care . Was admitted with severe headache over night . Have had this pain lighter  and sometimes worse since being seen at the lister hospital some 18months ago . It was advised that I saw a neurologist then although I wanted to see a  Rheumatologist. The neurologist then said the pain was multi migraines or neuralgia myofacial  etc .
This time at the Luton and Dunstable hospital thankfully. the doctors their said they sent patients to see the rheumatologist . I got the impression from them they did not suspect GCA as I  did   not  ,also my doctor .She diagnosed me originally with pmr ,but a year ago because pain had never really gone away was helping me to come of the steroids . My esr and crp have come down to normal the esr was always raised above around 30 about evidently crp91.4 . The doctors were happy with the result but as a precaution want me to take 60 mg daily of prednisalone ,which they have implied I was already on ,I was not as said before I had reduced to 6 mg and had pointed out to them .
Hopefuly I will get to see a rheumatologist within the next two weekbut cannot bring my self to up the steroid ,because people are wanting to do the correct thing  ,Knowing that none of us really think that gca pmr is the problem . 
I really do not want to take these tablet until I have seen a rheumatologistrI have already got glucoma cataracts bursts of high blood pressure which I never had before . 
I know that eye sight is the biggest risk at the moment ,however there is no temporal pain when pressed . No pain on Chewing in jaw . Pain in one neck shoulder muscle which feels like stiff neck . Tenderness on head 
I cannot face the thought of many more years trying to reduce a tablet which is only precautionary .
will they refuse to see me if I do not take this amount . Interestingly I now have developed a cough since the last weekend ,and the last few days in the heat of the hospital it has got worse so wonder if it's something viral that I may have caught some weeks ago .
What to do . If any one has had similar probs out there what did you do ?

An ESR taken about two weeks ago had increased to 29.
I am feeling desperately tired, stiff, neck and shoulders, hips, buttocks all ache and walking any distance is a real effort - not because of pain but because of lack of energy.
Has anyone had the same experience?
Are these symptoms common when coming off prednisolone?
The Dr seems to discount the possibility of the PMR having returned.

"Bit of background first. I fell off a ladder (yes, silly me) about 10 days ago now. The ladder slid out from under me and I landed horizontal on the ladder with my arms outstretched so all the injuries were on my legs and inside of my arms. 
So just bruising on my arms...big haematomas on my shin (which is fine now but swelled up like a golf ball in about 10 seconds!) and on my left thigh in two places.
My thigh is the area still giving me problems. It was really sore for about 3 days...could hardly walk although didn't come up in a hige bruise. Just some yellowing.
The past 3 or 4 days I can walk OK...just a hint of a limp. Keeping the leg still there is basically no pain. But every time the thigh is still for a period of time, and then I move, it is incredibly painful for about 15-30 seconds and then the pain goes away again.
Happens in my sleep which is annoying. Laying in one position is fine, then if I rollover, the pain returns and then goes away again.
Is this a normal part of the recuperation? The thigh took a pretty significant impact so I expect there's some goo bruising there. But just this intermittent pain seems strange.
Don't want to go to the doc and him say I need an MRI. They are VERY expensive and I can't afford one just for a sore leg at the moment.
Thanks in advance

"A little background on my history with PMR. In September 2016, I started experiencing swollen lymph nodes in my neck and pain in my neck and shoulders. Blood tests showed a high ESR of 45 (has gone up to 60 here recently) but not much else. It was assumed I had a weird infection. Started a 10 day regimen of prednisone (60 mg for 3 days and taper from there to 20 mg) and an antibiotic. After a couple of days the pain was a million times better and swollen lymph nodes were reduced greatly. However, by day 6 the side effects from the steroid was crazy on me. So it was decided to stop it and just finish the antibiotic. Needless to say, within a day the pain was back and worse than before. It was now affecting me just abut everywhere. My system was overloaded with pain. I could not handle a hug, getting dressed, etc. My PCP mentioned that because I experienced relief while on the prednisone that maybe I had a condition called PMR but he wasn't sure because I did not fit the ""typical"" demographic. I am a 37 year old African American female. So he worked to find a Rheumatologist that would agree to see me. I finally got into one in November 2016. During that wait time, I was on anywhere from 20-30 mg per day and it was barely controlling my symptoms for part of the day. After many tests to try to rule out every condition in the universe, the PMR diagnosis was confirmed the 2nd week of January 2017. My Rheumatologist was still shocked and told me I was a rare case. I was forced to reduce the Prednisone dose to 10 mg (which is not enough for my pain level) because of what it was doing to my kidneys and liver. It has led to me having high glucose  levels and lots of swelling. I  recently started 10 mg of Methatrexate per week in hopes it will help. I wanted to know if there are people out there around my age battling this.

"Despite taking 45 mg a day of prednisolone for GCA I have developed a tremendous drug allergy rash. I took a small dose of codeine linctus to help with a cough and the next morning I noticed spots all over my chest and abdomen. It has gradually got worse and 5 days on the spots have run into each other and formed flat pink areas. As prednisolone is used to treat drug rashes how is it possible that this happened? 5 days on it seems to be spreading.
I have just been prescribed an antihistamine which I hope will help as the itching is driving me crazy.. Has anyone else had this experience whilst on high steroids?

"The fluid retention caused by the Preds has just become too much for me, so I mentioned it to the doctor when I saw her yesterday.
I get it every time I have to go on a high dose of steroids, but always before it has resolved itself as I've reduced - this time it's got a mind of it's own and has decided to stay with me.
I've been given diuretics to try (with lots of warnings) and I have to go back in 2 weeks for (more) blood tests just in case.
I've only taken one - today - but it really doesn't seem to be doing much, anyone else taken these?

I am after some advice please.
I have had polymyalgia for about 3 years and now after several flares managed to reach 5mg preds which I have never managed to do before.

"I was rushed tohospital 4 days ago with a suspected stroke, Cat scan brain with perfusion showed no acute pathology, and no carotid stenosis. No haemorrhage or collection. No space occupying lesion.  There was a slight abnormality in my heart beat hence having a 24 hour Holter Monitor next week and also an MRI booked in as well, to check on heart beat. My trip to a Haemotologist for abnormal blood results is cancelled for 3 weeks, whilst I have these other tests performed. Am now on Aspirin as well as a higher dosage of my Crestor (for high cholesterol).
I was just wondering if any of you on this forum had a TIA problem, could this be the prednisone causing this as well?
I had a nice English Dr in the Hospital who said it may well be, though none of the Drs are sure about this.  The Haemotologist may well be able to help with this question....

"Sadly I have just realised that I do suffer extreme exhaustion after exposure to the sun. I have suspected it for awhile, and am now certain there is a link. 
I don't often take the time to sit in the sun, but I did on Friday, on our magnificent local beach on a wonderful summers day........ Then I slept for 36 hours and still want to go back to bed even now.  Exhaustion, aches and pains were at an all time low/high.
I don't want this to be true, but it has happened a few times this summer, so I now have to accept it is related. I was not there long enough to get sunburnt.
I can only find fatigue after sun exposure linked with Lupus, Chronic fatigue and MS.
I am diagnosed with PMR, so am wondering if other PMR people have suffered the same ?

"Hi Eileen and the gang,
I was diagnosed in Oct 14, having started stiffness and pain in July 14. I got down to 2mg of pred in May 16 and then ran into trouble, and posted so moved up to 7.5mg. I have reduced slowly and got to 3.5mg ok, but reduced to 3mg in December. 
I started to get pain and stiffness again, and had my bloods done last week. CRP is now 7.9, it had dropped to 0.9 when I first started pred, and has risen to 2 and then to 4. GP has asked to see me next week.
In July I started to have physio to try and work on the trigger points. I saw her yesterday as my shoulders were so stiff and I now have burning in my hips. I had one very painful  session with trigger points released and instructions to swim twice this week just to get moving and the muscles working.My houlder muscles are gritty apparently.
Any suggestions, apart from rest?
I do not want to have to go up too much as I have gained weight, hair fell out and have muscle weakness.
Thanks you so much.

"I am having a lot of pain with my hands. My rheumatologist insist that it can't be PMR. I know that a lot of you have said that you have pain with your hands. I even tried arguing with her but I got nowhere. She just said maybe I have RA. So I did a little research and I came up with a disease that is similar with PMR and often goes along with PMR. And I wondered if anyone here has ever heard of it. It's called RS3PE. It causes pain in the hands and the feet and yes my right foot hurts too. I'm going to bring this up to my rheumatologist and see what she says.

"Hello, I was diagnoded in December of 2016 after 7 weeks of extreme shoulder, arm and hip pain.  I am on 20 mg of prednisone and most days can manage pretty well except for stiffness in the mornings.  Recently I went away on a short car trip to visit friends and was back home in 24 hours.  That evening I had severe PMR symptoms which have continued on into the next day.  Can't imagine what happened, I felt fine while visiting and the 2.5 hr. car ride did not seem to bother me. I have only had 1 visit so far to the rheumatologist so lots more questions for him but does this disease go into remission?  Does it ever leave for good? Can we learn what triggers may be and thus be prepared or avoid them?  Thanks for any help.

"I am a 54 year old woman and was newly diagnosed in November 2016. I already have 2 other autoimmune disorders ( Type 1 DM and Hashimotos thyroid disorder). I am currently taking 12.5mg of prednisone a day and 15mg of Methotrexate a week. I have tapered down to my current dose of prednisone from 20 at the beginning. I tapered to 12.5 3 weeks ago. My rheumatologist wants me to taper 2.5mg every 3 weeks. My two questions are this: over the last week I have noticed an increase in pain in my hands and shoulders. Not debilitating but definitely there. Should I increase back to 15? Last question: how long does Methotrexate take to work? I will be increased to 20mg next month. Does methotrexate eventually take away the need for Prednisone? I put a call in to my doctor with prednisone increase question but didn't hear back. Thanks for listening!!

"Yesterday I felt like I just couldn't move; all I wanted to do was vegetate. I am on 10mg starting down to 9.75 last evening.
It took almost an act of God to get me to do anything. I forced myself to exercise to a TaiChi warmup on YouTube. It was only a warm up not all the intricate movements. It used extremely slow movements which weren't threatening or strenuous. It lasted 25 min. 
Afterward I felt wonderful and my energy came back. 
I have used warmups on a, mostly daily basis, but skipped a couple of days.

"I was diagnosed with PMR this past summer. My doctor started me on 10 mg of Prednisone and my stiffness and fatigue disappeared. Within 8 weeks I was down to 5 mg. This fall I started taking 2.5 mg and felt so much better that after a month I took myself off of the medication completely. I think this was a mistake! For the past several weeks all I want to do is sleep. Ten hours per night and I'm still lethargic and now feeling depressed as very achy. I've always been a high energy person and although I'm in my 60's, I work full-time in childcare. I can barely get through the day now. Finally got a call back from my doctor and she wants to see me AND suggested I go back on 5 mg. My main question to all of you: Could I be feeling tired and depressed because my PMR came back or is that not a complication of PMR??

"After sonogram, an xray, a cat scan and an MRI od my pelvis andpubis, What I thought was Osteitis, Pubis turned out to be two broken bones! I was close as one of the breaks is in or near the symphesis which becomes inflamed is Osteitis. Apparently a piece of bone has broken off and is floating around in my pubis. I also have a hairline fracture in my sacro(?).I have been in great pain for 2 months. The Ortho, who was a great listener and communicator unlike the rhuemi, said he had never seen a spontaneous break like this and said that thevlack of bone density was probably the cause.
I was wondering if I could continue tapering by 1.25 mgs.only reducing faster than once a month till I get to 10mgs. I'm at 17.5 at the moment and feel great ( for having PMR, of course) .Id probably be having pain from over doing it if it weren't for the broken bones.
I also have to travel to Seattle from Madrid next week due to a family emergency. My daughter who lives there was visiting for the holidays and they found some adeno carcinoma cells in her pap smear. She is a breast cancer survivor. Two of her kids, are back in seattle with their dad and he has no where to leave them when he has to travel for his job. I would have thought that all this stress would interfere with my tapering but so far it's hasnt.
Hopefully it means, too, that I'm not steroid resistant like the rheumi accused me of and can taper faster in order to minimize bone deterioration without the methotrexarte he prescribed and that I'm not taking.

"I am 12 months into my diagnosis of PMR and down from 15mgs Prednisolone to 7mgs. After 3months without pain and down to 11mgs I began again to suffer the symptoms of PMR, however a blood test revealed the PMR had gone and my doctor advised me to continue reducing the Prednisolone.
Now I can hardly walk, I have suffered severe back pain for the last 10 weeks for which I am taking Ibuprofren and pain killers (which don’t do anything only allow me to sleep for perhaps a couple of hours). My right arm is back to its pre-diagnosis uselessness and my knees have started causing pain.
I know that PMR can return and for all I am told it has not, and incidentally being refused another blood test , my question is.....can prednisolone or/and Ibuprofen prolong and heighten pain in areas such as my back? If this is the case – has anyone the answer to get me back on my feet, please?

"Where do I begin again, Biopsy was schedueled but after finding my very low vitamin d and blood calcium levels they decided to wait and begin Proli injections twice a year which should start within next two week, taking 50,000 mil of vit d to bring numbers up. I was on 60 mil and Rheumy did slow taper method because he could not do Temporal biopsy until down to lower prednisone level. It took a month and now at 10 mil but have developed the worse pain beneath the breast, for two weeks on left side now on right side, had xrays to see if broken ribs and it was negative but the pain is like a truck ran over me, Im supposed to taper tomorrow to 7&1/2 mil and stay there for two weeks but so afraid to. Dr did tell me if head pain starts to go right back up to 60 but this up and down is playing havoc on me. I am having a headache since yesterday and I took two extra strength tylenol which helped for a few hours and now its back. Overall Im getting so depressed because the pain now is so bad. At night I can barely turn on my side and my shoulders are burning and throbbing so not sure if I should go back to the 20 mil where I felt much better or listen to Dr and continue tapering. My Dr still insists that the pred is poison and he wants me down to lowest does possible but with this pain why would I do that.
Thanks everyone for listening, what would I do without this forum.

"I have had PMR for about 4 1/2 years and am currently on 3 1/2 mgs of prednisone.  My CRP levels appear to reflect how I am doing with my aches and stiffness.  My second most troublesome symptom with my PMR is fatigue.
I've recently made two 1/4 mg reductions using Eileen's slow method and my aches/stiffness are ok - no sign of a flare.  But I'm having some increased fatigue - ugh!  
What I am wondering about is that my CRP continues to be pretty good (2.0 or less) and going by that I could start another 1/4 mg reduction.  Should I just keep reducing and not worry about the fatigue?

"Well I'm sitting in waiting room waiting to get blood work. Just saw my rheumatologist. I tried to talk to her about the slow tapering method and even showed it to her. All she had to say was that she wants me off of prednisone as soon as possible. I pointed out to her that twice now I have had pain when I got to 10 mg. She said that I shouldn't blame all pain on PMR! I told her that there was no doubt that the pain I had was PMR pain because within hours of upping my prednisone the pain had began to subside. So she finally said I could do it my way, but then said she didn't know how to prescribe my prednisone. I told her I had enough at this time and if I needed more is would have the pharmacy call her. Then I told her I found out I was prediabetice. To which she said that's another reason to get you off the prednisone as quick as possible. Oh and she is going to up my methotrexate too which I told her is making my tongue sore. But she said she will also up my folic acid too. I don't want to be on prednisone either. But damn I don't like the pain either.

"Sorry if this is long winded I'm just so desperate to know what is wrong with me. I know only specialists can do this but any advice or experience would really gratefully received.
So back in May 2016 I was getting swollen eyelids and lips plus more regular headaches but only enough to need paracetamol/ibuprofen. Assumed allergy so was refered for allergy tests. June 16 i went for the app but was told no need for allergy test and told to take double dose of antihistamines daily. So come Nov 2016 headaches grew worse, saw doc who said viral. 2 wks later went back, again told the same thing. So 3rd time was Monday just gone. The pain was now unbearable like hot pokers stabbing to get out of my head plus shoulder and neck pain. Doc sent me for bloods and I was phoned that evening to go straight in as lab phoned with high ESR of 93 and to start meds as he thought from results he knew what was wrong. He told me GCA and gave me prescription for 60mg steroids daily. As it was 7pm he said he'd speak to rheumatology in the morning. Tues morning he said rheumatology won't take me on due to my age and want me to go through neurology first. I have that app next tues.
So he sent me for more bloods weds when he called as neurologist wanted these before app to save time. Then he asked to see me yesterday and to repeat bloods he did on monday as other levels from then were high too and as been on steroids since mon night he wanted to see if any change in bloods. He also added in iron check too.
I don't know if meds have made a difference to bloods but only partly lifted my headache. Doc spoke as if it should work like magic. I can barely move my head in the morning. Force food in me to take the vile 12 tablets. Everything I Google to look at the full mix of my high levels seems to come back to tumour or bone disease. I'm such a worrier as it is but now have to wait until Tuesday to see neurology.
I feel really spaced out, light headed, tingly, andvas if the pain has moved further round to my jaw and temples. Beside myself with worry. Don't know who to turn to. I guess I'm just hoping anyone here may be able to relate a little.
These are my results from Mondayin brackets is what the average is.
liver panel
alkaline phosphatase 172 (30-130)
gamma gt 189 (0-45)
Biochem screen
egfr 71 (90-120)

"I started Prednisolone last July, 15 mgs. For a few weeks I had the energy of 10 mad women and felt fantastic before reaching a plateau.  I've tapered quite well, without too many problems and at New Year went to 6mgs. 
Since then I am so tired and generally my body feels as if I have been doing physically strenuous work, which I haven't. That is how I felt before completely stiffening up and diagnosis last year.
Because of the fatigue I am often late getting up and therefore late taking the Pred. Is this part of the problem maybe?
Any advice on getting back on track are welcome. Thank you.

"I have been diagnosed with PMR on Dec 10 2016 . Not quite sure of the cause or how it came to be but in the summer 2016  I had trouble swallowing food to the point  that it would not get past my esophagus.  Resulting in having to get rid of the food or vomiting.  If I had a glass of water near by I would be able to get my food down with noticeable discomfort. 
  So off to see my doctor with persuasion from my better half.  The doctor sent me for a barium swallow at the hospital. Results were a narrowing point part way down my esophagus.  
  Now October 2016 I have been sent to a Endoscopic Surgeon for consultation. He recommends having a scope done scheduled for late  November. Results are extreme inflammation of my esophagus and stomach.  He tells me to start taking a stomach pill called Pantoloc. 40 megs twice daily. 
   Within a week is when my pain started in my legs and shoulders start.  So I went on line on a Saturday night of agony in bed unable to turn either side of my body and found that one of the side effects of Pantoloc is soreness in lower and upper body. My solution was to quite taking the Pantoloc. 
   Back to my specialist first thing Monday morning only to find he is gone on holiday for the Christmas season. So I tell the secretary that I am not taking Pantoloc anymore because it caused a reaction. She would e-mail him and let him know. 
  Back to my GP Tuesday morn. She recommends waiting a week to see if the pain goes away. The pain does not go away but not as intense with Pantoloc. During that period I took Ibuprofen and it helped but not 100%
   Back to Doctor Monday pain is still there. She give me a couple of arm and leg tests blood test and Serium  protein was at 31. normal is .3

"I took advice from a far more experienced and knowledgable contributor to this forum, and made an appt. with my G.P. (it took a week), to ask to be referred to a Dr. near me who specialises in G.C.A. and pmr. I stressed that I had no objection to my Rheum. but after two years, (not all with the same person), I felt I was getting nowhere. He told me I was already under the care of a specialist as Consultants are those very people. I asked about inflammatory markers, anf he said they weren't too bad crp54 and esr 46, I said that seemed high and he said they were no indicator in some people. I asked why the steroids had been reduced if the markers were not dropping, his reply? They are dangerous drugs, they need reducing, I said they had saved my sight but I knew the dangers. I am having a bone marrow test soon as my platelets are high, I was referred to a Haematologist by my G.P. cause of high white blood count, my Rheum. said that I should have the test whether or not I need it. My white blood cell test was negative, but the platelets were high, so hence the test. The outcome was, my G.P. said he was not empowered to refer me to another Consultant, and I should see my Rheum. and ask her, at least I got it all off my chest, but to no avail. Thankyou anyway for the advice.

"Hi, I can't seem to figure out how to search this particular forum for the posts that might be about this subject, so if anyone can explain that to me, thanks!  About this: My history is 3 years of PMR, trying to reduce pred. getting a flare, and going all the way up to 20 mg for a year, and now reducing to 15 due to an upcoming knee replacement operation.  I'm in so much pain on 15 and my SED rate went from 41 at 20mg to 52 at 15mg.  I'm just bearing it for the help it gives to not get infections at lower doses during operations.  So, anyway, today the rheumatologist decided to give me a low dose of methotrexate to take with the 15 pred.  We are going to see if that lowers my SED marker.  Has anybody else done this?  Thanks for any info.

"I began tapering 2 weeks ago and I feel great at 19.5 mg. as far as the PMR symptoms are concerned. However, 3 and ago, I developed a pain in my groin which I initially thought was trocantheritis .I googled the it and my symptoms were different. I was that my son who is a chiropractor and my husband who is an MD both agree that it is Osteitis Pubis. I googled it and found some articles that associate it to PMR and GCA. One of the treatments for it is a course of 5 days of 40mg. of predisone.
I have an uncontrolled supply of predisone so I was thinking of taking the 40 mg. for 5 days but I'm not sure if that would affect the tapering and how I should taper from 40 to 19.5.
This thing is much more incapacitating than PMR.

"I have been in so much pain lately. All last week I had my first PMR flare. What I had was joint pain and an all-over flu-like feeling. So I'm assuming that was a flare. It was over by Saturday but i still have joint pain in my hands and feet and my lower back to this day. I have chronic back pain anyway but it is out of control pain at this time more so than ever and I think it's acting up because of the PMR. I haven't called my rheumatologist because I have an appointment with her on Monday and I thought I can make it till then. I tried to change my appointment to this week but she didn't have any openings. Today I finally gave up and called her nurse. But it was late in the day and I didn't hear back from her. I'm sure they'll call tomorrow. The reason I didn't call sooner was because I figured the only thing there is to do is up my prednisone. Well I'm on 9 mg right now. I can't seem to get below 10 mg without pain.. She put me on methotrexate to help me get below 10. and it's not working. I was on 10 mg for 3 weeks when the flare started. At the end of the flyer I was supposed to drop down to 9 mg and since I was already in pain I went ahead and did it. The pain hasn't changed it's still bad. I am so frustrated at this point. And I am in so much pain. And I am on very strong opiates for my back which don't seem to be doing anything for the PMR pain.

"Help, I'm in a panic!  My Rheumie is questioning the PMR diagnosis, due to the level of muscle pain, cramping, weakness and tearing I have been experiencing.  She referred me to a neurologist who wantst to perform a muscle biopsy.  It turns out that this hospital only performs Open Muscle Biopsy and they want to do the two hour procedure under local anesthetic.  And by the way, sorry lidocaine can't reach the very inner layers of the muscle and your will just have to deal with that part of the procedure. They will be making a 2-3 inch incission and taking out 3 pencil erasers size chunks of muscle during the two hours.  
Doesn't this seem excessive?  Why do an open biopsy when a core biopsy is so much less invassive? Has anyone had this procedure done?  Did it even show any results that made it worth it?

"While looking up the details of this paper to use for an answer to someone I discovered that it is now available ""free to air"" without paying for access to a journal. Helen Twohig is a GP in Yorkshire England and was part of a group who carried out a survey to assess the effects of PMR on patients and their day to day lives and experiences with it.

Much of it is in medical science-speak so a bit complicated but throughout it you will find quotes from the patients. Those of you who are familiar with Yorkshire will hear their accent - I do! 
I'm hoping the moderator will allow it because you may find some of these quotes useful to give to people so they can understand a bit of what you are going through. And if you happen to be in the Sheffield area - there is a rheumatologist mentioned who you'd think might really understand PMR! I don't know if he is still there.

"I saw my Rheumy before Christmas and he said as I've reduced to 4 mg/3.5 I should continue to reduce .5 mg per month and come off them by the end of winter. He also dismissed (sorry discharged) me saying if any pains appear to ignore them as just caused by ageing and not PMR. My CRP was at 6 which he said was slightly raised but not to bother with any more blood tests. He also pointed out low salt and blood pressure but said nothing to worry about. Oh and weight loss. 
I had a very busy and stressful Christmas and still suffering after effects. I have continued to reduce using dsns to 3 mg but my repeat prescription no longer exists and am struggling to get a refill from GP. Also, no appointments available for 4 weeks.

"I found something in a new app I found called Medical Wikipedia, an android downloadable app.
While reading what they said about PMR, I found this as a cross reference:
""Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema
Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (abbreviated RS3PE or sometimes RS3PE) is a rare syndrome identified by symmetric polyarthritis, synovitis, acute pitting edema (swelling) of the back of the hands and/or feet, and a negative serum rheumatoid factor.[1] If no underlying disorder can be identified (idiopathic RS3PE), this entity has an excellent prognosis and responds well to treatment.[2]
RS3PE typically involves the joints of the extremities, specifically the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, wrists, shoulders, elbows, knees and ankles.[3] It is more common in older adults, with the mean age between 70 and 80 years in most studies.[3][4] It occurs more often in men than in women with a 2:1 ratio.[3][5][6] It is unknown how common this condition is.
Signs and symptoms
Individuals affected by RS3PE typically have repeated episodes of inflammation of the lining of their synovial joints and swelling of the end portion of the limbs.[7] The arms and hands are more commonly affected than the legs and feet.[7] Both sides are usually involved though RS3PE can affect only one side in certain cases.
There is much more in the article.
Very, very similar to my experience.
Would love to hear the knowledgeable and wise opinions of my friends here!
Thanks,

"Went for results of high white blood cells and platelets to Haematologist today. The white cell came back negative, but the platelets are still high, so I have to have a bone marrow test. After having routine blood tests for hypertension in 2015, I was told my G.P. needed to see me, I had been having troublesome pain in my neck and shoulders, so decided to kill two birdswith one stone. He gave me Naproxin for what he later suspected was PMR. which went onto GCA. supposedly in Nov.2015. He also told me I was making too many platelets, and had too much inflammation in my body, this seemingly has hardly ever changed, I was told today that if the bone marrow test comes back negative, the cause must be ""all this other stuff that's going on"". My mind is now boggled!

"Hi, any help would be much appreciated.
PMR diagnosis has now been confirmed following a 2 week trial of Prednisolone. Bloods tests showed everything was normal. All shoulder and arm pain completely gone! Hip pain mostly gone but right hip today is very sore. GP wanted me to take 30 mg for 2 weeks, but I started on 25, now at 20. Gp has suggested 2.5 mg weekly decreases until I get to 15mg then go back to see her and I'll be keen to go very slowly with reducing. So many questions and worries! Like many on here I have/had a very good level of fitness but am learning I have to pace myself and I'm already seeing leg and ab muscles becoming soft and lacking tone. Will this deterioration continue? I also have 2 bulging lower discs, and have managed this by regular core/back strengthening exercises. My lower back is sore today alonh with right hip pain...Not sure how I'm going to maintain core strength if the pred limits what I can do?
Also GP said to go back in 3 weeks and get calcium/vit D supplements. I'd rather start this now, but unable to swallow any large tablets...Are there chewable options?
I'm having disturbed sleep, mostly because of night sweats...Is this a side effect of Prednisolone?
How do people manage work and PMR? Im 54 and have been off work for 3 weeks..I had become unable to cope with a highly stressful job along with the tiredness and pain. But I'll need to go back soon and worry how I'll cope with the stress again. I've been referred to occupational health and a phased return will help. Ill be reducing my week to 4 days soon which will also help.
Feeling a bit despondent today... Start of a long journey I think.
Thank in advance for any support and suggestions.

"Diagnosed with PMR in April, 2016. Started at 15 mg with good relief of muskuloskeletal pain and have tapered down to 10 mg.
Currently, the inflammatory pain in my shoulders, neck and arms is manageable the majority of time with some days worse than others.
However, I find that the muscles in my lower back, legs, butt and groin ""seize up"" and limit what I can do and how much I can walk. I also feel very fatigued and have to sit down to give those muscles a rest if I am out and about.
For example, today I went to the store to return some gifts and after only 10 minutes of walking I had to sit down because the muscles in my lower back were in such a tight spasm and my legs felt powerless. 
Ironically, I can go to the gym and ride the stationary bike for 40 minutes without issue since I am sitting.
I ask if anyone else experiences this because I am wondering if it's PMR or some sort of spinal issue that is contributing to these symptoms.
Thanks and Happy New Year !

"Hello to all of you who take your daily dose of steroids in the early hours of the morning. My question is this, what do you eat before hand and why is it necessary to take steroids with food? I usually take my daily dose, currently 6mg, somewhere between 8am and 9.30am but because my whole body aches such a lot within an hour of getting up and I feel so physically exhausted until around 2pm, sometimes longer, I wondered if taking the steroids around 4am when I usually have to get up for th loo, would help. I tried this last night with a few dry crackers and managed to go back to sleep until 7.45. I don't feel quite so tired today but the aches are still there although not so bad.. Maybe they are not PMR related. Any advice

"As many of you have experienced, coexisting medical problems many times confuse our ability to manage our useage of Pred. About six weeks ago I began fighting a new manifestation of my age old back problem in the form of sciatica. But I confused it with PMR pain and blamed it on low adrenal output and felt I had gone too low and passed the magic point of just enough. So I kicked it up from 4 and half to 10mg. After three days I realized that i was on the wrong track. Here is where I think I have been over this once but dont recall. I have been trying to get back down without problems and have reached 5 and half. How fast can I drop the other 1 mg? Even though I asked for this dance, I would like to finish it.

"a summary - will was convinced by my rheumatologist to take Prolia shot( have osteoporosis and PMR). Probably a month later I had pain around my 5 yo right molar implant. Antibiotics weren't touching it so oral surgeon removed it. He did find a piece of necrotic bone at the site of the implant. That was Oct 8. We were scheduled to leave NYS for 6 mo in Florida, which we did. Gum was healing fine after dry socket but under control. Then slowly I developed aching in right jaw,escalating to strong persistent pain. I saw a dentist here in FL as well as a root canal specialist. Who could find no other teeth problem. Conclusion drawn by GP that I had Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia. After many ineffective drugs including Lyrica, ended up on gabapentin 2 100 mg daily. Seemed to calm down. THEN - developed swelling dead center under jaw and swelling under tongue. Treated as an infected sublinginal salivary gland. Treated with doxycycline- calmed it down tho not S completely. Went off to CA for Xmas- developed nasty facial rash from some sun exposure 4 days after finishing the doxy.  That cleared up over that week. Day we get back home, my LEFT  what appears to be my submandibular gland swell and pain severe. Now on erthryomyacin. This, dear reader is where I am. I have had two CAT Scans of jaw and face that are negative. I spent two long visits in the ER. I fear lymph node involvement or worse.  Isn't an MRI in order? Wouldn't it show more of the bone. Concerned of necrotic bone. This all has gone on since removal of implant Oct 8 - and now its nearly 3 months later and no closer to the cause. Have apt next week with Rheumi to pick his brains and an oral surgeon the following.
any input....please and thanks??

"I seem to recall someone's mentioning trigger points in one to the discussions. My PMR diagnosis was preceeded by almost a year of trigger point concerns. From the beginning it was clear that my trigger points were bilateral. Was this sufficient evidence to determine that the problem was always PMR? 
And as a related issue - my initial back pains (trigger points) were totally relieved, sometimes for days, by appropriate massage. Is massage effective for PMR?

"I am asking for your thoughts here as I'm not getting much medical support here of late.  I have been on Prednisone 3.5 years and the last 2 years have developed a persistent chest cough which causes my chest to ache when I cough or sneeze.  Have any of you had a similar issue?  I suspect it is a side effect of taking the steroics.  My CRP has steadily risen over the last 6 months, which is unusual, from 3 to 6 to 10 and now 32 which it very high for me!  My doctor wants me to have a stress test to see if the heart has been impacted.  My shoulder and upper back have become much more achy the last few months as well which probably correlates with my high CRP and this week I am fighting a virus which is causing these muscles to ache even more.  I'm on about 9 mg of Prednisone, well actually a year ago my Endocrinologist switched me from Pred to Cortisone thinking it might trick my body into letting me reduce my dosage which unfortunately it didn't do.  I'm thinking of maybe asking my family doctor to switch me back to Prednisone from Cortisone since it works for longer hours and is stronger than Cortisone and I expect he has much more experience prescribing it than Cortisone.  Unfortunately my endocrinologist decided he was unable to be of further assistance so he sent me back to my family doctor.

"Hi All, I am on 50 (which I hear is young) and have been sufferening since May 2016 and only diagnosed in November. Was put on 25ml pred which almost cleared all pain and increased to 40mil to see if it would get rid of it completly. There was no real difference so went back down to 25ml. I have been really lucky as I am having no side effects yet. Trying to reduce but going down to 20 but the pain in my back and shoulders are slowly coming back. I feel that as long as it does not come back into my hips and knees I can cope with the pain. Is this the right way to think. I do want to get off pred but if I reduce more will the pain start to spread again? How bad is pred for you?

"About 2 years ago my husband (47) had knee replacement.  With a few setbacks, he has recovered, but seems that now the rest of his body is falling apart.  Since then he has had surgery in both the right and left  ankle tendons.  Now his rotater cuff is hanging by a thread on the right side.  He has pain in his sternum (which he has had ever since a coughing attack about 2 1/2 years ago).  The depression is terrible.  The way our family now functions is based upon his pain.  He can't do activities with either of our boys.   He saw a rheum. dr. but didn't get a good feel for this person.  There is PMR in his family (Swedish decent).  He is taking a prescribed NSAID with little to no help.    I would like to try something more natural - herbs, oils, etc.  He wants a quick pain fix - but isn't getting it anyway.  It scares me what these medicines will do to liver, stomach, etc.    Any advice is appreciated.  This is a nightmare for what used to be a very active man.

"After a little over a year on the stuff, I'm now at 8mg medrol (=10mg prednisone). It has been a life-saver from the point of view of PMR pain. It's difficult to imagine life as it was before pred. But there are the other effects.
Skin effects, for example. Lots of red and purple blotches. And areas of my skin have become very sensitive to touch. Rubbing against a hard surface is quite painful. Even a reasonably hard shower makes some portions of skin sting quite painfully. Do those effects abate at lower doses? That sensitivity acts as if it is an inflammation? But isn't pred supposed to decrease inflammation?
Shortness of breath on exertion - is that a negative effect of pred, or is it generally helped by pred?
Then there are the chipmunk cheeks and buffalo hump. Is there any damage to the body because of fat deposits? Or is that completely reversible?
What about increased susceptibility to skin cancer - specifically basal and squamos cell?
I would greatly appreciate hearing from PMR victims who have gone into remission, or however it is characterized when there is successful reduction of preds to zero. Have the pred efffects gone away? Are there residual effects?

"I just went for my 2nd Bowen Therapy session to assist with symptoms from Polymalgia I've had for 2 years.  I found I'd feel somewhat better one day and stiffer the next.  Yesterday I showed up for my 2nd session with a terribly stiff neck probably from lifting a 2 year old and painting my art too long.  I immediately got 50% relief with the neck which continues today but now the WHOLE body is unfbelievably stiff!  My understanding of Bowen Therapy is that this is not uncommon and tomorrow I could experience far less stiffness.  Unlike conventional deep massage this is such a delicate process and there is a minimum of hands on in the one hour session.  It seems they hit trigger points and this activates the cells and tissues memories to revert back to more healthy function but not without some old symptoms reappearing first.  I'd welcome some of you sharing your Bowen experiences and giving me a sense of what to expect.  I'm sure hoping it will help me along here.

The last few days the left arm has gone very weak and is hard to lift.  Is all of this a result of PMR and being on Prednisone this length of time?  I recently tried laser therapy on my shoulder but that made it worse.  I've tried a bit of physiotherapy to keep up the range of movement and strength but this can also easily aggravate it.  Does anyone have any experience or advice here?  I'm on about 8 mg of Prednisone right now.  My doctor is unsure of what to do as is my rheumatologist other than putting me on another medication which I don't won't to take.

"Hello Everyone, 
Sorry I've not been around for a while, I've simply been so busy what with the holiday cottages and decorating the house. I do however read lots of the posts and by the time I've read them I've seen that others with more knowledge and experience have already answered and there actually is nothing more that I could add. I am doing very well. After my PMR diagnosis in the December of 2013 having had symptoms since the September of that year, I am down to 3mgs using Eileen's dead slow and almost stop method. So far so good and in my journey only suffered the one flre whilst attempting the reduction from 9-8mgs. It was following the flare that I adopted Eileen's reduction method although I only ever reduce by half a mg. Hopefully in the New Year I'll find more time to support you all, because that is what this site is so good for. As well as Eileen's knowledge, I've noticed that many of you are impowering yourselves with knowledge that you share with us all here. Excellent!

"Hope you all had peaceful Christmas.
I was discharged from hospital just before Christmas, thinking I just had a cold, I was admitted with low oxygen, high blood pressure and immflamtion 188, don't know which was more scary.
Managed a lovely Christmas day with family, then pulled a muscle in my back.
So as I have been ambling between bedroom, bathroom and kitchen since boxing day, I have had some time to think, and would like to ask you all for some advice.
I fully admit I don't understand this illness, but I was reading an article that suggested as well as suppressing inflammation, finding the route cause was a way of healing the immune system, there are tests, either yeast, antibiotics build up.etc
I am convinced food or my intolerance to it has a direct bearing on how I feel, gluten especially.I have seen an allergy consultant and she said she can't help with intolerance.
So what sort of tests could I ask for when I see my gp ?
Not wishing to ask too many questions, but why is my mobility less now having been diagnosed in May, than it was a year ago.
I am learning mindfulness and pacing, but this is like ""nothing ness"" and a futile existence.
From diagnosis to now feel like I have been left to it, without this forum I truly believe I would have gone mad by now.

"Hi Eileen, I would like to pick your brains please and also find out if anyone else has had the following experience. 
I have been dropping half mg every 4 weeks since I reached 16mg and every time, I feel rotten for a week, with aching muscles in the back (not a flare) and sometimes  pain in the wrist with fatigue.  But since my last drop on Tuesday I have had no side effects at all - no pain, no aching or fatigue.  I find this strange as I have been really really pushing myself over Christmas, driving home after midnight 1.5 hours on Christmas Eve and cooking for family on Christmas day with no feet up in the afternoons and with the stress that entails.
My question is, do you think the side effects have disappeared because I am now on the lower dose of 12.5mg which suits me better and if so, do you think I may be able to drop 1mg this month successfully instead of just a half?
I am so grateful that I am feeling ok and don't want to upset the apple cart but also wondered if anyone else has had this sort of experience?   I have been on Pred for a year starting at 30mg.
Many thanks and a Happy New Year to everyone.

" The discussions on this site tend to centre around PMR and they are always interesting and often useful. However I would like some input from others who suffer from GCA. I went blind in one eye about 14 years ago and saw a consultant at Moorfields who said nothing could be done. PMR and GCA were not diagnosed. More recently I started to lose the sight in the other eye and went very deaf. I had already been diagnosed with PMR and given low doses of prednisalone which did help a little. Like so many contributors to this site I found GPs varying wildly in their prescriptions of prednisalone. One called 10mg a high dose and wanted me off them as quickly as possible; another said I should increase the dose.
Eventually I saw a consultant opthalmologist and a consultant rheumotologist, but even they did not agree on the dosage of prednisolone. Finally they agreed on a massive dose of 60mg pd which I have been reducing gradually. I am now down to 22mg pd. I do not have a great deal of pain from the PMR but am largely confined to a wheelchair, while the loss of sight and deafness are worsening. I do not expect miracles and the restoration of my sight and hearing but I would like to prevent them worsening further.
So, has anyone had a similar experience and have they managed to halt the progressive loss of sight and hearing? I am most anxious to hear other peoples' experiences.

"Hi everyone and Happy Holidays to you all! I'm a mess today, saw my Rheum yesterday, last week I was getting some scalp pain and they immediately put me up to 60 mil of pred from the 10 mil I had been at for two months. Yesterday Dr said he wanted a biopsy like  immediately but couldnt do it while on the high dose of pred so had me start decreasing today by 10 mil, staying there for four days, decrease again by 10 and staying for 4 days and continuing this until Im back down to the 10 mil. I was only at the 60 mil for 6 days. He also contacted the surgeon, and told me that should I get any flare or scalp pain during this taper to immediately go right back up to the 60 mil, go to the lab with the script for my blood work and then if no flare the biopsy will be within a week or so as soon as they can get it scheduled. Im so confused and scared at same time because he told me I would need general anesthesia, Im reading where it says a local is all thats required and he said no. Im wondering why hes not keeping me at the 60 mil longer, he said if biopsy is positive then I will be on the higher dose for much longer but that he needs me down to lwest to do it. Please any advice here on what to expect? Thanks again and I sincerely wish each and every one here the Healthiest New Year & merriest holiday season!

"I never drink liquor because I'm on opiates. But this morning I was going to have a mimosas. Just one, no big deal. But I just read online that alcohol does not mix with methotrexate well.

"Hey guys! Wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. I'm 25 years old and for about a year the middle joints on some fingers have been swollen. It's 3 fingers and they are symmetrical on each hand. However, there is no pain and no stiffness. But definitely noticeable swollen joints. And it's been like this for over a year. Due to the lack of pain or stiffness I have not felt it urgent to go to a doctor, but the swelling does not seem to be going away. Any ideas?

"Does anyone have problems with their mucous membranes when taking prednisolone? I have a sore and burning mouth, mucous drooping down the back of my nose, a sore stomach and I’m coughing up a lot of clear phlegm from my lungs.
I thought it may be the Lansoprazole that was causing this as a sore mouth and stomach is listed as a common side effect but could it be the prednisolone? And would that affect the lungs?

"Hi, newbie here. I went to GP 2 weeks ago...Aching hips, sore upper arms and stiffness in feet. Generally feeling unwell in yself. Fit and active 54 year old, walking often but unable to do as much due to pain in hips after exercise. GP thought PMR but blood tests didn't confirm this as no raised levels. He suggested Prednisolone but I was reluctant so I have tried 2 weeks of meloxicam, anti inflammatory. Slight improvement I would say, hips aching less so I am able to walk daily...Fast and hilly. Arms still sore in the morning unable to raise them and stinging sensation /pain in the night so not sleeping well. I should add that I have started HRT 2 weeks ago and due to stress at work and worry about my health I'm signed off til Jan. Today GP has given me prescription for 30 mg Prednisolone to try for 2 weeks. Given that I haven't a diagnosis of PMR what are your thoughts. He feels if I am much improved this could indicate PMR. If it isn't PMR what is it? Would a further blood test be helpful? Scans? I'm very confused!! Thanks in anticipation

"I was just at the Dr to discuss my latest CRP results (better than expected!) and she asked me if I'd had my bi-annual Prolia injection (I have). when I got back to work I thought I'd do a bit of digging and I found a couple of things that make me wonder if Prolia may have contributed to my PMR developing. Just my imagination but is there a coincidence? Anyone else had Prolia injections?
Check this out:
Prolia was approved in 2010 for the treatment of osteoporosis and for preventing new bone fractures especially in postmenopausal women. This new drug modifies the regulatory control of the immune system over bone remodeling. Its cutting-edge design is matched by the ease of its twice-a-year administration. But Prolia is far from the wonder drug it is being promoted as. By modifying the immune system, it impairs general immune response. And curiously, Prolia can kill off the bones of the jaw and cause hip bone fractures.......
The lack of long-term safety studies for Prolia makes it highly dangerous. Reading the product’s safety information on the manufacturer’s website is particularly depressing. Amgen lists a number of horrifying adverse effects of Prolia.
One can only wonder what other side effects are there if the manufacturer admits to such profound damages.
The severity of the identified side effects of this drug makes it even worse than bisphosphonates. And only time will tell what new side effects will emerge in a decade when independent safety studies are published.
Most of the side effects of Prolia are caused by its negative influence on bone remodeling and its interference with the roles of RANKL in the immune system.
RANKL, for example, is required by T helper cells. By inhibiting such immune cells, Prolia increases the chances of infections, hypersensitivity reactions and autoimmune diseases.
Even the FDA raised concerns about the effect of Prolia on important immune cells and cytokines. But then, the regulatory body approved the drug a year later.
While the disruption of the immune system is terrible, the effect of Prolia on bone remodeling is simply unforgivable. Even Amgen admits on the product page that Prolia can cause thigh bone fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw bone.

At Christmas my Poly will be one year old
Mr Pred who’s the steroid, helps lighten the load

And the drop for one week leaves me feeling quite low 
There’s only one answer to keep me pain free
Take two thirds in bed and one third after tea

He works really hard then I don’t feel too rough

"To-day is the Lucia Day in Sweden. She comes with lights in her hair and in her hand. She enlightens us in the darkest period of the year with light and songs. This morning, Ragnar came and woke my wife up with the Lucia song and while drinking morning coffee we watched the TV programme with traditional and new Lucia  songs. We both thought back at celebration of Lucia when we went to school and when the children celebrated Lucia. If you are interested to find out more you can google Lucia in Sweden and also find songs on Youtube.
On December 13 in 2008, I got off pred after 3 ½ years of pmr and GCA. I had found out a new way of tapering slower than before and finally got off pred. I chose to say that I did it on December 13  - the Lucia Day in Sweden, because it is easy to remember and it also is a positive day. For us who have or have had pmr and/or GCA it is nice to know that Lucia is there with a light at the end of the tunnel.
On August 16 – my 79th birthday – I made a presentation in Chertsey, Surrey for the NE Support group about my story about the Ragnar method to taper pred. It was very nice to meet so many that I had just read about on the forum. Some are also on this forum.
At last, I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

"Hi everyone, well its been like a storm hitting me, I've been on the 10 mil of pred for almost two months and suddenly yesterday scalp pain returns and chewing starts to hurt so today my Rheumy tells me that I definitely need to start taking 60 mil of pred immediately. The highest I was ever on when first diagnosedback in February with both PMR/GCA was 25, and I was immediately cured and felt perfect. Then I was slowly tapered down to 12 where I was almost perfect but now at the 10 the scalp and head pain coming back. Does anyone know how this high dose is, are there any bad side effects because I've tolerated these other doses with no problems at all. I'm so scared to go from 10 to 60 all at once but this Rhematologist group is excellent and I trust them so just scared as to what to expect.

"I missed my appointment with my rheumatologist. I was having a CT scan the same day an unfortunately it went wrong when the contrast went into my arm and not the vein. Fortunately I was given an appointment the next week. 
My steroids have gone down to 50mg and I see him again Christmas week. No news on the biopsy yet but I have been sporting a lovely black eye probably due to low platelets. On reading more about this thing I had never heard of I realise how lucky I have been. In the fortnight before I went to A&E my sight had grey patches three times and on looking at my health notes for late last year I read, “In the last month I have had transitory greying out episodes which I have had before. There is no headache with these but I have been told that they may be a sort of migraine. I usually rest until my sight is restored which can take about an hour.” When I wrote that I had no idea they might be significant.
The prednisolone is affecting my blood sugar and I am now waiting to see a diabetes specialist nurse to see how to cope with this. My urine sugar is nil in the morning but off the chart by afternoon. I have been told that this is a prednisolone associated diabetes. It doesn’t make me feel well, apart from all the peeing throughout the night and day, I have been having shaky episodes. Out shopping yesterday, my husband who is type 2 suggested that the way I was feeling might be low blood sugar and encouraged me to have some chocolate I had in the car and it seemed to do the trick. If anyone has had the same experience with prednisolone, how did you cope with it?
Thank you all for the help you are giving me, it is much appreciated.

"I began having severe pain in my neck and shoulders in the evening thru the night and for several hours in the morning. At one point, I could barely walk and could not raise my legs to get into bed or move my arms at all. I was diagnosed with PMR and put on 20mg pred daily. After 10 days, I was reduced to 15mg, but I'm having pain again (not as debilitating, but I am awake most of the night unable to sleep). After reading some of the discussions, I am going to call my primary doctor as I think my dose dropped too much too soon. I have an appt with a rheumotologist in 5 days. I didn't realize how fatigue was overtaking me until the pain became so great at night. I'm so glad to read conversations and insight of people who are struggling with PMR - its just so strange to feel so normal during the day and be overtaken with such pain every evening/night/morning. Has anyone tried collagen hydrosylate? I started making smoothies and adding this and matcha green tea along with chai, coconut milk and yogurt. I'm hoping this will help with my symptoms.

"I am 58, diabetic for 25 years and was diagnosed with GCA in January 2016 and sent to see an ophthalmologist.  When I saw him on a Friday, he said I probably didn't have it.  Reasons:  too young, had good blood flow, seed was too low (26).  I had a biopsy on Wednesday which was negative. When I returned too see him I told him I was glad that I didn't have GCA, but I knew I had PMR.  Within a day of being on prednisone, my hip, shoulder pain and stiffness that I had been dealing with since a strange flu I got in October 2014 was completely gone.  He treated me like a munchausen patient.  I was just merely happy that I could point to something that was causing me such awful pain for such a long time.  
My family doc, who was kind of a shyster, kept me on the pred at 20 mg until February, when he encouraged me to taper down completely, since he no longer felt that I had either condition.  I did.  By march I was off the steroid, and by the end of the month it was like everything was back with a vengeance.  
I waited 4 months to se a rheumatologist.  In may I realized my glasses which I had renewed from -2.25 to -4 in February were no longer working.  By this time I was having constant headaches, jaw claudication, scalp and cheekbone numbness all the time.  I went to the emergency room and was asked to read an eye chart.  With my glasses on, the big e was blurry.  I was put on prednisone again, sent to an ophthalmologist again, and another biopsy, which was negative.  
By this time I was able to see a rheumatologist,  I just kept calling until they had a cancellation.  I explained everything that had happened and told him I know I didn't have GCA, but I was pretty sure I had PMR.  He told me then, I was atypical. My sed rate was 31at that time while I was on prednisone for a short time.  I had all the symptoms and he felt safer treating me for the condition. Plus, he said that a biopsy could miss an affected area quite easily.  So, since July, I've been on 60 mg of prednisone with mild headache flares.  I have tapered to 50 mg and the headaches are worse and I have double vision when I'm really tired. 
Ive been through tests to rule out other conditions.
One if my questions is: I didn't have any headaches for at least 30 years (suffered from tmj, and went thru successful treatment which stopped the headaches) and these headaches are totally different.  Will prednisone help with other aches and pains?  Because I have some osteoarthritis which does not respond to the steroids.  The rheumatologist said it wouldn't.  I hate the steroids, but the pain I go through without is worse than the side effects of using them.

"Can anyone recommend a London-based NHS rheumatologist who specialises (or maybe has interest) in PMR?  I'm looking to get a second opinion as I don't feel I am being managed well by current rheumatologist.  
I'm in constant pain and it's really wearing me down.  GP prescribed 2 x 30mg cocodamol, 4 times a day, which is giving no relief.  I saw him as I'd developed new pains that radiate from buttocks down back of thigh.  From what I've found on the internet, it could be tendonitis.  I've got a private physio appointment on Tuesday, as first NHS one not available until January.  Unfortunately I don't have private healthcare, so seeing a private rheumy is not an option.
I understand that painkillers don't really help with PMR inflammation.  I was on 10mg (fairly comfortably, i.e. pains were bearable) for a while when I started MTX in mid September.  MTX has made no difference (I was told it can take up to 12 weeks to kick in) and, in fact, as I was reading through my medical file I saw that my rheumatologist wrote to my GP in May saying ""Unfortunately, steroid sparing agents are not effective in this condition""... so why on earth did he start me on them in September?!  It's just nonsense and I have lost faith in him.
When pains got worse a couple of months ago, I increased pred without consulting with doc.  I had been on 10mg... tried 12.5... then 15.... then up to 20mg which is the highest dose I've been on since starting taking it.  This time, even at 20mg, the pain was still bad, but I didn't want to go any higher without approval from consultant.  (I was on 20mg back in January, and had reduced slowly over the year.)  I managed to get a telephone consult with rheumatology nurses and they told me I should reduce pred every week... despite being in pain.  None of it makes sense.... which is why I'm looking to get a second opinion.
I'm actually wondering if I have something other than PMR... or on top of PMR... maybe fibro, as I do have many tender points - particularly shoulders and hips... but do not have the muscle pain/weakness in thighs/arms/shoulders I read are common with PMR.
If anyone in London is happy with their rheumatology team and can recommend them, I'd be grateful.

"Very disappointing, but I suppose to be expected: I am having my first flare up. History: diagnosed PMR, 2 weeks 10mg pred, 2 weeks 15mg, 6 weeks 20mg, diagnosed GCA, 4 weeks 60mg, 2 weeks 50mg, 2 weeks 40 mg, 2 weeks 30mg, 6 days of 25mg with steady increasing stiffness in the shoulders and hips, cramp in one leg (the one where I have a damaged nerve near my spine). Today back to total stiffness, fever, a headache (that I recognize), sensitive scalp and jaw pain. Not good. It seems that I have not made much progress in the past months with the underlying disease....
Now back to 30mg, hopefully, it will be high enough to suppress the symptoms. I am afraid that if my eye darkens again, I may have togo back to much higher doses.Patience, patience, how very close to patient...

"I have bruises on my arms and I understand this comes from the Predn. though what is confusing me is that my skin on arms from elbow joing down to top of fingers is very fine and like paper and therefore every little nock or bump creates these unsightly red marks. 
Why does this happen only on that part of my body, and my skin is normal to touch and look at on legs, face, back etc?
I have come down in 18mths from 50mgs of Pred. to 7.5mgs, and this phenomenem is becoming worse, I thought it would correct itself being on a lower dose of Predn.
My MOON face is almost back to normal, also my weight.
My inflamatory markers are high once again, though I have very little pain happening now.

"Hi everyone, i posted on here a while ago as i beleive i may have this conditon, but the last few nights it has been a lot worse with the pain, i havent slept for three nights, the pain seems worse when i get into bed, my legs, arms, neck my whole body is in pain, i take Gabepentin along with co-codomol, and ibruphonen as i am being treated for fibro, but for years my ESR levels and CRP have been extremely high and to be honest my GP hasnt done much about it, i was there the other week and my potassium is now high and has been repeated and i go back tomorrow for the results, he has refered me to a Rhemotoligist but that is not until March. I dont know if it is the cold wheather that affects my condition and think i am also starting the menopause. I also feel very bloated and puffy.
But I really cannot cope with this pain any more and dont know if it is PMR or Fibro or can you get a combination of both?
Is there anything I should ask my GP if i can start or try.
I really am at my wits end with this pain and trying to work after having no sleep at all.

Of course those who have been ""cured"" may be no longer following these discussions. Some of us are willing to try any thought that is otherwise harmless.  It'll give us something to do between moans of exhaustion and aching.

"Hi everyone,
Has anyone with PMR experienced their LDL cholesterol level increasing despite good diet and exercise? I am on HRT though with a seperate testosterone gel which I believe can increase the bad cholesterol? I do however have a familial history of elevated cholesterol with aging in my parents.
I mentioned in a previous post I was trialling a supplement phytoprofen for my PMR symptoms instead of pred, which is a combination of tumeric and bromain. I also take fish oil, krill oil, evening primrose and an activated B complex daily. I juice veggies and small amount of fruit each morning for breakfast and now follow a low carb diet. The only side effect I've noticed with the turmeric is dry and flaking skin of my face?
Despite the amazing effectiveness of pred, I decided to stop taking it unless I got a bad flare up as I was concerned about the long term side effects. Apart from the first few months of being prescribed it, I haven't had to use it for the last 6 months.
I believe for me the supplements must be working as my pain and stiffness are now down around 80% if I don't do strenuous exercise. Interestingly though, if I drink wine the next day the aches and pains are more noticeable.
Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

"Well havent been o here due to husbands illness but finally have some time to post. Have been diagnosed with both pmr/gca since last February, was started on 25 mil and have been tapered to 10 mil a day for the past few months. I have been taking 7&1/2 mil at 5am and 2&1/2 at 5pm. I started trying to take the morning dose a little later, 5:30 so maybe this is the problem but not sure. Developed really bad shoulder pain last few days and overall feeling achy all over but thank God no scalp or head pain which I'm always afraid of and looking for.
When I was on the 25 mil I was totally pain free within a day, a miracle, considering I couldnt walk, move my legs and my groin was so painful.  The Rheumy tapered me with the slow method and even at 15 mil I was 95% better, then at 12 mil I was ok and tolerating this dose ok. I was also ok with the 10 mil until the past three days and this morning Im in agony. My back and shoulder are so painful and Im feeling stiff all over so thinking maybe I should go up to the 12 mil. I can get an appt if I need to within a few days but honestly every time I go the this Dr I have to pay $75.00 and all he does is either up the dose or lower it and he sees me for literally five minutes if that. He does do all my blood work every eight weeks or so but Im not due for any now.
Thank yuo for any advice & I'd like to wish everyone here a very Healthy and Happy holiday!
Sincerely,

"I gather these are the same though I have never been told I have vasulitis. Needed 40mgs at the start etc. I have had slight  (but within normal limits) reduction in renal function. no breathlessness or tiredness, mainly painful biceps, occ joint pains. I get palpitations, tachycardias, occ' arrythmias and a 'thumping' heart, often when resting too. Have had ecg/echo etc and they seem to think pred' side effects and a touch of inevitable anxiety. This has all reduced as I got below 20mgs. BP normally fine and good at the mo.
MY Q is about the possibility of aneurysms and strokes. Should I be asking for a scan to check...if so what ?  would I need to wait till off steroids?

"My husband has been newly diagnosed and I feel very anxious about what we may face. I would appreciate any feedback on my questions below. I do my best to remain supportive, calm, and positive with him. But I need support from people in the know. 
I purchased 3 books focused on Polymyalgia Rheumatica, 2 of
which focus on diet.. They were helpful but the info about the risk of GCA and diabetes alarmed me.
This is is his brief story : after diagnosis he was put on prednisone and experienced some intense side effects so he is now on a different steroid, the steroids brought immediate relief but also some depression and sleeplessness.
So now  he has a sleeping med, a beta blocker ( for heart related side effects, pounding heart, etc) and the new steroid. No anti-depressant yet. 
Jere are my questions as we would,greatly appreciate any input and personal experiences:
1. Has anyone here avoided weight gain? We have been told that moon face is inevitable. We were also,told that weight gain is not inevitable if a strict diet is followed. So far, no weight gain, Adoet is being followed-low,carbohydrate, added calcium, etc
2. I am wondering how to help support him?. I confess the almost  constant negativity and depression has made me feel gloomier too and I feel,guilty about thst because he is going through much worse. I would not cope nearly as well as he has. He is not self pitying, I believe the depression is steroid related. 
3. Is 2-3 years typical for steroid use?
4. Have most here experienced GCA or diabetes - or both 
5. What has your spouse some thst has been mosf helpful and supportive? spouse 
5. Which specific diet and food restrictions are best?

"I started my journey March 2017 and it has taken all this time and still not a proper diagnosis. I have had so many scans and tests as to this day my ESR are still 40 and CPR 45. I started on 30mg predisolone now have reduced down to 7mg. I have been onmethaxatrate for 2 months at 25mg. My rheumatologist still believes its RA although my bloods dont show raised ANA.
purely as he believes I am too young for PMR.
My question is why is my blood still showing raised markers. I amfeling better though but have been dieting as put on a lot of weight with steroids and trying to do light exercise often.
My rheumatologist said by March next year he wants to start a new drug called biological something i didnt get the full name.
apprently very expensive here in Australia and have to go through
this method before I can start.
Wanting other opinions please. Also the methaxatrate has caused my liver enzymes to rise and I believe he doesn't want me to be on this long term as the steroids has had major side
affects on me.
I have been reducing now 1mg per month off the steroids and so far so good. Am confused my he believes its RA as clerly symptons are in my muscles and not joints and all the bone scans shown
no joint problems.

"I’m interested in forum members’ experience with physical activity.
I’m 82 yrs old. Diagnosed PMR a bit over a year ago. Suspect I had PMR for a year or so prior to diagnosis. There was no upper body involvement, no headaches. I assume no possibility of GCA.
Before PMR I was very active. In excellent aerobic condition for my age. One of the first things I noticed (besides extreme stiffness and pain in my lower back and inner thighs) was weakness of upper leg muscles and shortness of breath on exertion.
After I was put on regular dosage of medrol, all of those symptoms were gone. Then there was a roller-coaster period of adjusting the dosage after which the symptoms gradually came back while reducing medrol.
I am now at 8mg medrol (= 10mg prednisone). I am very active - mostly pickleball ~5 times a week, with some walking. I’m also able to carry fairly heavy loads, 45-50 lbs, which does stress my back (soreness follows). I’m still fairly stiff but not incapacitated in the mornings, and cannot play pickleball without breathing heavily, and cannot walk at my old speed of 13 minutes per mile.
From reading about the extreme problems of many of the forum members I fully realize that I am very lucky to be able to do what I can do. I certainly do not mean to complain. What I am interested in learning is the experience of others who were very active immediately before PMR. How has your activity level changed? During aerobic exercise has your breathing become problematic? What about lifting and carrying?

"I was diagnosed with Polymyalgia and GCA almost by accident. I had a chest infection and a week of antibiotics but four days after finishing them I went back to the GP with a sore throat, swollen eyelids and a swollen ear canal. In the discussion on swelling I just happened to mention that I had a swollen ‘vein’ on the side of my head. To cut a long story short; 10 hours in A&E, rheumatologist appointment within the week, immediate start on 60mg prednisolone per day and today I go for a biopsy.
When I look back I realise that I have been in trouble for some time. I have osteoarthritis but my osteoarthritis didn’t seem like everyone else's. I had pains everywhere for about two years, fatigue, sweating, shooting pains, sore areas etc. It seemed to come on very suddenly after going on a short walk and realising I was having trouble walking back. It was downhill from there and I put it down to, rightly or wrongly, starting statins. I was in such a mess that I told my GP I never wanted statins again.
Because I have multiple health problems It was very difficult for anyone to diagnose the problem but looking back I see that signs had been evident for some time but no one, including me, had put two and two together. Because of my health problems I have kept notes over the years, and looking back over this last two years there are multiple comments such as ‘pain in front of ears’, ‘headache on lhs’, ‘I think one of my veins is swollen’, ‘can’t sleep on that side’ etc. I seemed to be on a downward spiral of pain.
Fortunately I have a very good GP who always takes me seriously and tries her best to find solutions, even writing to my consultants to see if they could throw any light on anything.
So here I am, I’m not looking forward to the biopsy but I feel strangely happy that at last I have a diagnosis and if all works out well I can look forward to better health.
The steroids have been great, not a joy to take but the swelling was gone within 48 hours as was the stiffness and a lot of the pain. I have been on high steroids before for another reason so I know it is no picnic coming off them but I managed it and I will again.

So advise if you can, shall I stay at 9 mg ? and for how long and then maybe reduce to 8.5.
This seems so hard, when it shouldn't be.
Mentally I feel rubbish, can't make decisions when I do I change my mind, does steroid use do this to you?
I had no idea what a bumpy road this is, and I shouldn't moan I am sure many of you have this worse than me.
Any advice would be helpful.
Thank you

"I have recently been diagnosed with Post Subcapular Cataracts or steroid induced cataracts. Although the optometrist advised they are not far enough along to operate there are two things that concern me. First the deterioration in my sight has all happened in about a month. And secondly she seemed more concered about my dry itchy eyes than the fact that my depth perception is off. I cant see road signs until im right on top of them and im not at all comfortable driving at night because of glare. Also dont know how much to tell my gp. I would be lost if he yanked my licence as i live in the country and have no other way to get around. I was on steroids for 22 months. Has anyone had experience with how long you have to wait or how bad it has to get before they operate.

"Hi everyone : Well I am still tapering as per my Rhuemy , but have dropped 2.5mg over 2 weeks not one week: 1st week was hell, so extended to 2. 
Yesterday I had my Simulation done to start the Raidation Treatment in 2 weeks, it has been very slow coming. It was not easy holdin that position for 3/4 hour with PMR : But all the ladies where understanding and it had to be done, and when I do start the treatment it will be just 10mins : I'm just annoyed it has taken so long, and now will run into Xmas, 5 days a week for 5 weeks: 
But I am grateful for all the Free medical we get here, the MRI, breat operation etc has not cost me at all, so I can't complain on the wait.
Thanks for all the great advice and information I get from here: I was not happy with the Rhuemy at all after waiting 3 months to see him.

"the more i read, the more questions i have, initially had typical symptons of pmr, gp didn,t do bloodwork before putting me on 40 mg pred, so when referred to rheumy, she had no baseline bloodwork to help diagnose, and had already been on pred for 13 days at that time, so she said hard to know as pred can affect all blood levels, i had reduced to 30 by time i saw her then, had more bloodwork done, wbc counts,but of course esr levels,etc not raised at that time, i have been on 20 mg now for 22 days, and had a flare it seems about  14 days ago, and still have symptons of that on and off, question is, how will she ever know at this rate if in fact i do have pmr, and since 15 mg is the norm to manage inflammation, and at 20 i am still having symptons, leaves me frustrated not knowing for sure if pmr, all she had to go on, as well as initial gp pre diagnosis, was typical pmr symptons, shoulders,buttocks hamstrings pain on awakening for quite a few hrs each day,of course at 40 and up until 20, pain not quite so obvious, but after what i think was flare from activity day before, have all symptons daily for 4-5 hrs in am, some in eve, i know ive been told over and over to be patient, but when diagnosis not confirmed and pain not controlled completely at 20 leaves me frustrated and stressed, and of course, with only 3-4 hrs sleep each night, nerves on edge most of time, and that,s not solid sleep, interrupted at least twice a night,running to bathroom, or discomfort in shoulders, ?

"Hi, 
I lifted heavy weight while doing exercise at gym that resulted in pain. Got diagnosed by an ortho. X-ray was fine. He told me to undergo physical therapy. Even after 1 month the pain did not subside much.
Ortho then told to go for MRI. MRI showed disc bulge at L4-L5. Doctor told its quite minor and no need to worry. Gave Vitamin-B12 supplement and told to go for physical therapy for one more month.  Do disc bulge pain subside on its own or do disc bulge shrink ? Its been 2 months and the pain has only reduced by 20-25%.
Pain is mild to moderate. Its moderate when I sit for longer period. Pain sometimes raditates to hips and leg. What should I do ?

"I have had PMR for 2 1/2 years. This week I have had a scare with an agonising pain above my right eye that was NOT a normal headache (which I am prone to) and which for 24 hours would not respond to several different painkillers I tried. Aware of the dangers of GCA from this Forum, I went to my GP on Tuesday. I live in Zimbabwe where there is no rheumatologist with specialist knowledge of PMR/GCA, and I told her of my fears. She called a physician colleague who explained the dangers associated with untreated GCA and recommended that I go from my hard-earned 7.5mg daily dose to 60mgs. I did that and within 12 hours the pain had subsided and in another 24 hours had more or less dissipated. But... My ESR and CRP bloods came back normal (which I know from this Forum is possible) and now the two doctors are debating whether this is GCA. My GP is inclined to diagnose sinusitis and has put me on an antibiotic and my optician (so concerned about the pain behind my eye and fearing perhaps a tumour I went to him yesterday) has given me antibiotic eye drops.
i have done lots of Googling over the past 2 1/2 years into our condition, not to mention learning copiously from Forum patient experiences. This is something frowned upon by the medical profession which seems to think it leads to dangerous self diagnosis. I don't have the sore jaw symptom and this together with the blood results put a question mark over the GCA diagnosis.
Is there any other way I can determine whether I indeed have it? If I don't have it I don't want to be back on 60mgs - but if I do I don't want my doctors to be quite innocently complacent and take me off the dose. If they suggest I stay on it as a precaution, do I reduce the Pred in the same way as with PMR, ie painfully slowly?
To complicate my situation, I have for some reason been removed from this Forum's email list and have not received any posts for a month. I have tried re-registering to no avail and am hoping by writing this I will be reinstated. I can't give me email details because this will be moderated, so unless this works I have no way of communicating with my Forum life line at a time when I so badly need advice.
Hence,..help!

"Hello. I pleased to have found this forum.
I am new to this. diagnosed in march, Pred 40mgs and started to get 'symptoms' back when down at 12.5/10 mgs. I am curious to know what you class as 'remission' and at what level people stop reducing and move back up to previous dose?  ie I now have stiff hands/knee joints till mid day which I have not had previously!  I wonder if it is better to go above ie 15mgs and follow the 'dead slow' method or do I ignor relatively 'annoying' smptoms and just carry on?  Do you include ESR & CRP levels in your decission?
LVV? not really sure how symptoms differ from ordinary PMR?  perhaps its just a bit more vigerous
Anyone out there with vigerous palpitations and arrythmias, don't depair, mine stopped after I got below 20mgs Pred'.

"k so much controversy, i was told,by gp, and now have heard many more say, if you have pmr, it will respond to pred, if not then perhaps not pmr, regardless of markers. However as you all know, when gp started me on 40 mg, with no baseline blood work, my pain was alleviated that same day within hrs, however, when i did get to see rheumy 13 days later, her response was, that dosage way to high, any pain would respond to 40 mg ? so right from the get go, unconfirmed, of course(done 2or more years ) chest exray results from my jan physical, and any bloodwork that had been done since i saw gp, also wanted result from urologist report of nov 15th, and then had me drop from 30-20 between oct 25 and to nov 7 when i saw her again, which i am still on,now i did have either flare or whatever on nov 8, which i have been struggling with, as she wants to keep me on 20, she is away now 3 weeks, and told me if symptons subside over wk or 2, try to drop to 17.5, but if not pmr, then what, EORA? so what are symptons for that,  and why did initial dose, down to 25 and 20 for 10 days, manage my symptons, don,t you have pain in small joints, wrist, fingers, ankles etc with arthritis, what i am trying to ask, is what symptons are different, and blood work between pmr and rheumatoid arthritis

"This is an unusual one...... I had a crown fixed a couple of years ago following root canal treatment.  I had low level pain for months and kept telling the dentist who said it would settle down.,... Then I needed a filling in the next door tooth and the pain got even worse.....  So finally the dentist removed part of the filling and found that a bit of enamel from the crown had embedded itself in the gum and it was very inflamed and bled a fair bit when he removed it.  After a couple of days of pain, I was pain-free there - what a relief!  Weird thing is that I am now so used to low level pain that I had just got used to it.... However, I have a feeling that this whole thing probably raised my inflammatory markers and may have impacted on PMR generally.
I don't expect anyone else to have had this particular peculiar problem but...... does anyone have any thoughts on gum inflammation and its impact on pmr generally?
I am seeing my rheumatologist in ten days so will mention this to him.

"I am in my 12 th year of prednisone use. Many years between 10 and 5 on internest instructions. Never knowing about this site I decided to quit while on 5 mg. good for awhile then big flair. Sent to rheumy for the first time with pretty good results with reducing. You can imagine tho how thin and always bruised my skin is. I have had many trips to ER for terrible cuts and skin tears.  But two months ago I had a bad fall while carrying a furnace humidifier and cut my leg deeply by the tin. I was diagnosed with compartment syndrome and had two surgeries to drain leg. I have been going to home care for dressing changes for two months but leg got infected the infection is a bad one and yesterday more surgery for debridement.  Today surgeon told me I had to completely go off pred or it will never heal and I could lose my leg.  Also will need skin graft which wouldn't take if skin doesn't improve by going off pred.  Of course I have no option but to listen to him. He said I can live with the PMR pain for that long which of course is true as I had it for 2 o3 months before diagnosis     My plan is to quit of course and phone rheumy when I'm released from hospital...possibly a week as he wants to check to make sure no more infection before I go home. 
My question for you knowledgable people is this. Do you think methotrexate would help. I've read on here it takes a long time to be effective.

"Hi, I am just starting to taper down from my Preds was on 32.5 now since Friday on 30mg: I saw the rheumatologist and he said I could split my dose if I needed : Taking the higher in the morning and 1/3 afternoon. This is only my 4 day of tapering 2.5mg , but I am finding by late afternoon and night I have pain again. 
Am I not giving it enough time to settle the new dose? I assume it takes longer than a few days to get the inflammation under control. But in 5 days I am to drop another 2.5mg and so on every week for 6 weeks.
Should I give it more time before trying the split dose ? : 
He also said I should take Alendronate on a weekly basis. 
Has anyone else been on Alendronate? I don't like what I read on it.

"I would appreciate some advice.  One day at the end of March 2015, I suddenly couldn’t get out of bed and could hardly move.  I waited 5 weeks to see a doctor and was finally diagnosed with PMR in May 2015 and started on 15 mg of prednisone, which brought relief.  In June 2015, I was also diagnosed with breast cancer and had surgery and treatment for that.  In the fall 2015, I started on an aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, to prevent recurrence of the breast cancer.  I also have been taking synthroid for years for an underactive thyroid.
All was going relatively fine until the last couple of months when I started having bad pains and stiffness in my knees, so much so I can’t kneel, squat or fully bend my knees. My walking is a bit odd and going down stairs is difficult until late afternoon.  My right knee is much worse than the left.  I was down to 6mg prednisone with fits and starts and am now back up to 7mg.  The prednisone doesn’t seem to help the knee pain, but naproxen sodium (an NSAID) does seem to take the edge off the pain and stiffness though doesn’t completely eliminate them.  I am waiting to hear the results of an xray from my rheumatologist. 
My question for this forum is how do you sort the cause out?  Does PMR cause swelling in joints that might cause this problem and if so, why did this develop later?  Or could my garden weed pulling and house cleaning obsessions when I was feeling ok due to the higher prednisone have caused knee problems (I didn’t know I was supposed to go easy though I should have based on how I felt AFTER these obsessive sessions—I just have a hard time letting things go…).  I know letrozole can cause joint problems, but this problem didn’t develop until after I had been taking the letrozole for 6 months.
Prior to PMR, I was totally healthy and active and never had pains of any sort.  Any ideas are welcome.  I’ve learned a lot from this forum and it has been extremely helpful.

"Just wanted to mention that I recently discovered I have low iron. My GP never checks my iron but a specialist happened to do it when I asked her about my hair loss. So now I'm on iron pills (and yes, having side effects from that too).  My thyroid test was ok - she said low thyroid is another common cause of hair loss. 
Dr Google says that if you take your calcium with meals it can block the absorption of iron from foods so you should take calcium between meals. Since the Pred has caused me to have osteopenia I take lots of calcium and had been taking it with all 3 meals. 
I think my main problem is that I don't eat enough meat so I'm rectifying that too. 
Not sure if this will help anyone else.....but wanted to tell you about it in case it rings a bell with anyone. 
Im hoping the low iron is part of why I have had so much fatigue with my PMR.  It would be a bonus if the iron pills increased my energy!

"Hi all,
Last time I saw rheumy he decided to start me on MTX as I was unable to get under 10mg of prednisolone without a flare.  It was interesting that at the start of my pred journey, he stated that MTX was the 'big gun' and best to be avoided if possible... but after almost a year of pred, he changed his tune saying that longterm pred at 10mg was definitely riskier and less favourable than MTX and whilst I may have adverse side effects from MTX, I would definitely get them from pred if I continued at the level I was on.
So I was started on MTX 12.5mg weekly for 2 weeks at the start of October (I guess to check how well I tolerated it) and increased to 15mg every week for the last month.  No adverse side effects.  Rheumy encouraged me to keep trying to taper down from 10mg of pred and my next appointment with him is mid-February.
Well, I know it's perhaps a little early to feel any benefits from the MTX as it can, I'm told, take up to 12 weeks to have any affect... but I've gone into a major flare and have reluctantly been increasing my pred over the last few days.  I've gone up to 20mg again, which is the highest dose I was taking when I started on pred.  But it's still not enough to control the pain/aches etc.  In fact, I've developed a new symptom for me where my buttocks hurt and walking is so hard.  I feel like I need a good oiling! LOL!
So (finally!) to my two questions:
Those of you who have managed to reduce pred dosage when using MTX, what dose of MTX works for you on and what pred dose are you still taking or did you come off it completely?
Also, do you think my plan to continue increasing pred dose by 2.5mg every other day until I get the current flare under control is a reasonable approach?  Or should I jump to 5mg increases?
I am so grateful to all the contributors on this fabulous forum.  I really don't know where I'd be without all the support and information I glean from here.

"WARNING: I feel such a fool. I am on a very low dose of Prednisolone, 7 mgs. I know I am very lucky that such a low dose has eased my symptoms significantly but I ended up in A&E yesterday, accidental overdose!!!!!!!! After the pain 'winning' and begging the GP for steroids for Polymyalgia - I had refused them for 5 months - the improvement has been miraculous. So far so good but I got a repeat prescription this week and wasn't told they have changed and didn't notice that the packaging for two different doses are now identical, 1mg and 5 mgs. What a fool I felt when I realised what I had done...............5x my prescribed dose. I rang the NHS helpline and they were going to send an emergency ambulance as this was an 'overdose', aaagh!!!! We cancelled the ambulance after a 2nd call from the paramedics and my husband took me off to A&E. 4 hour waiting on arrival but triage 'sorted' me remarkably quickly. Thankyou NHS although a GP told me today the NHS helpline, 111 is wasting so much precious money in needless ambulances being dispatched. Note to self: put on glasses and always check.

"I have been past weeks weaning down to 15 on prednisone, having had PMR for over year and a half. Recently developed rash over most of my body--I think from ""Plaquenil"" that Rhem dr prescribed (and have stopped)-- and couldn't sleep despite antihistamines and Benydryl.  My primary doctor told me to take ""40"" mg prednisone each of two days and then ""20"" each of two days, then back to 15.  Took 40 again today and rash grief has almost entirely disappeared.  Now I'm turning to the experts: Although I'm anxious to be off pred., at sudden drop from 40 to 15 in 5 days seems at odds with the ""slow"" advice I've monitored from you folk.  What would you do?

"I present a problem with prior backround to the same GP who seems intent on diagnosing, orders Xray, then after radiology reports no significant change (hips this time), he passes the report to me through online channel with no further intent to find the problem. And this is a nice doctor who has been of significant help in the past with cardiac bypass, PMR etc. 
I can't help but conclude that even if it's a subconcious thing, there is a strong tendancy to ignore medical problems in the very aged patients and devote energy towards those who can be helped with less effort. My main question today deals with the differentiation of the effects of PMR and Pred dosage with symptoms related to OA and similar. I'm sure there are markers involved concerning the nature, location, and timing of pain involved that are very familiar to many of you who have suffered and or have communicated with those who have. Getting down to specifics, my ability to walk any distance pain free has steadily shrunk since march of this year. I have had PMR since January 2014, on Pred since May 2014. Currently at 4 mg and holding. Untill August I was still able to play doubles tennis for at least two hours 2-3 times a week. Then the pain in my quadriceps kept increasing, sometimes both sides, right side mostly at this time. The right quad pain sometimes extends to the knee and calf. It pains on demand much as you would describe vasculitis. Yes, I know. I'll be 86 end of this month and should be happy to get out of the chair. But this is what life extension is all about. These things have answers if the patient or his doctor have the dedication to follow up. This is my follow up instead of give up. I have probably left out some details that would help and will be glad to fill in. If experimenting with a significant increase in dosage for a reasonable time period would eliminate the well known problem of low cortisol, I am ready to try.

"Hi, After waiting over 3 months to see this rheumy, he gave me 20 mins of his time and a tapering plan and said see you in 6 months.
Some history:
Told I had PMR in April 2016, started on 20mg Pred, then month later signs of GCA up to 40 mg of Pred for a month. Started to taper got to 35mg. Then they found I had breast cancer, so since they would give me a boost while under they left me on 35. Had operation on 5th October, all well.
Started to taper again and got to 32.5 then saw this rheumy yesterday. He was not happy I was still on a high dose and gave me a taper plan:
He was familar with PMR etc ( Scottish ) and had himself been on Preds, so knew what it's like.
Click here to view image
Also as of the 15th of this month I start 5 weeks of radiation therapy every day. So I know it will not be a easy time, but I am happy to at last be tapering down.  
HIS PLAN :
On Now 32.5 mg Prednisone I will start on 1st December.
1st December Down 2.5 to 30mg for one week
8th December Down 2.5 to 27.5 for one week
15th December Down 2.5 to 25  for one week
21st December Down 2.5 to 22.5 for one week
28th December Down 2.5 to 2o for one week
6th Janurary Down 2.5 to 17.5 for one week
Then it will be tapering 1 mg for every 2 weeks until I get to 10mg .
Then when on 10mg I will be tapering 1 mg for every 4 weeks and keep going like this.
He also said to go by the calender week.
He also said I should be taking 100mg of Aspirin a day ? which I will talk to my Dr about next visit.

"Hi
My husband had an ablation because of Atrial Fibrillation two years ago and it was a complete success, however, he then developed PMR and has been taking Prednisolone. He is now down to 4mgs and has started having palpitations and his blood pressure is very high. He says it feels as though he is on full throttle all the time.  His doctor has given him a 24 hour monitor and he has to go back tomorrow for the results. His doctor has said that he may have to take pills to lower the blood pressure depending on the results.  I thought I read somewhere that it can take some time for the Adrenal Glands to get back into synch and wondered if that is what is happening here. Is there a test that he can have to see if that is the problem? Thanks for your time. Jackie

"    Hi, it has been a little over a year since I have participated in a discussion on this site. I do not get on the computer often, but I feel that since it helped me when I first got here to this site, a couple of years ago, that I should shed some light on my experiences. I was finally diagnosed with PMR 11 years ago. Blood test never showed any unusual  inflamation, but after trying many things, I doubled my dose one weekend of 20mg pred. to 40. Finally for the first time I felt normal. I call PMR ""tin man disease"" because I think when you have it it feels that you need some human WD-40 to take away the pain. I am currently a 65 yr male, and 11 years ago I suddenly felt like I was 98 yrs and I could hardly move. I won't bore you with all the details, but over the last 11 yrs I have been up and down with pred, even off for over a year. I have never had any side effects that I know of, and I have had two bone scans and all is well. From my experiences I find that if I can stay between 3 and 4 mg that things adjust to normal. I hear other people seem to suffer side efects, but sometimes wsonder if that might be other issues. I recently started tapering down from 4 mg starting in June, 2 weeks ago I was down to 1 and started having pain again in Nov. I have tried over the 11 yrs to come off pred and finally decided that if I feel good below 5 mg, 3 currently, that I am never going to try to go lower. It is not worth it. If you have had similar experiences, with no side effects, my advice is to accept a low dose and stay there. I also used to get numbness and tingling in my hands and arms, diagnosed as carple tunnel, but I think it is related to PMR as it also stays away on a low dose. I hope my experiences help some people understand a little more from someone who has been dealing with this issue for over 11 years. Good luck to all with Tin Man Disease. Low dose pred.= human WD-40.

"This website was suggessed to me for information to find coping skills after I prgoressed rapidly to GCA. I wanted to know about how people coped and learn from their personal experience. I admit I am more frustated now, simply due to what I am perceiving as others seem to related to finding something to accept blame over, something they might have done that has lead up to the horrible medical condition. This is something that even my own GP has used in discounting my explaining what I am feeling, rather than helping me. However, having said that, I do appreciate input, answers and shared experiences. In an attempt to find something that might personally help me with coping. But I am not a believer in somthing i personally have done wrong. Yes, at my age of 67, I do believe I have some well earned aches just from living. But nothing to the level that is so physically debiliatating as GCA. I am now in a three day flaire-up. I am feeling very defeated and tired from no sleep due to the horrific pain. My goodness, the word comfort is so darn elusive, and something I crave...thank you for allowing my vent.

Then in Sept, things started worsening, had an attack of severe pain lower abdomen,sep 5, gradually pain decreased over few days, but saw gp in meantime, wanted me to have xray on shoulder,(was starting to bother me, thought was tendonitis at that time), and pelvic ultrasound on abdomen and pelvic area, because i was going away on fishing trip booked previous year, had to wait til i returned to have all those tests done, returned sept 19, had urine spec, some bloodwork done(don,t know exactly what) and pelvic ultrasoud, external, and internal done. tests came back pelvic ultrasound,showed nothing significant, shoulder showed some arthritis, calcium build up, not enough to cause the incr pain i was having, of course i was having tightness, pain, buttocks, glutes as well then.

"Hello. I'm new to this site. I'm wondering if anyone who has been diagnosed with GCA also suffers with chronic migraines? 
I've had migraines for decades and have been chronic for about 3 years. In 2013 in was diagnosed with polymyalgia, and then GCA earlier this year. The higher dose of Prednisone keeps the pain away, but as soon as I begin tapering I notice the pain returning, especially on my temples. My doctors are relating this to the GCA, not the migraines. It's very frustrating trying to differentiate between the two.
Thanks to anyone who has an opinion. Wishing you all pain-free days.

"So I tapered WAY too fast (from 15 mg to 2.5 mg in one month) . The pain came back on right side butt/hip only so I increased to 3 mg, then 5 mg, then 7.5 mg and finally now at 10 mg within the next month. Have now been on 10 mg for 13 days. The pain is still there but only one side. So today my Dr. said that she thinks the pain is actually coming from my sciatic nerve issue so gave me a shot of pain med to see if it takes the pain away. Is only effective for 24 hours. I am to call her tomorrow to let her know if it took the pain away. If it does, then apparently the pain is from the back issue. If not, it is PMR pain. My question is, is it common for the pain to be only on one side? This is why she believes it is NOT PMR pain. But It actually started out that way, then spread to both shoulders, arms. 
Unfortunately I am dealing with 2 health issues at the same time and they both affect the same area of my body. It's been 2 hours since the pain shot and I still have the same deep, aching pain in my right butt. Almost what I would imagine bone cancer pain to feel like? Guess I will know more tomorrow when my 24 hours is up.

"well my gp started me on 40 mg prednisone 18 days ago,prior to getting my rheumatologist appt, on oct 25th, he tapered me to 30 mg before seeing her, my initial visit with her resulted in some confusion for me, after studying the limited information she had, ie,blood tests prior 2 wks, shoulder xray,ultrasound, prior 2 weeks, and mri had done in july, showing some back issues, she ended with saying, she couldn,t confirm pmr diagnosis, with all back issues etc, could be cause of pain in glutes and hamstrings, and shoulders could be tendonitis ? she needed more infor from gp about me, my history, bone density, lung xray had done last january at physical, more blood tests etc, this has left me nervous, stressed as to what else could be going on with me, she instructed me to taper to 25 x 3 days , then 20 until next visit to her nov 7th, also to get bloodwork done after 4-5 days on 20 mg of prednisone, has anyone out there had this situation, taking a long time to confirm pmr diagosis,

"Hi,
I live in North Carolina so things might be a bit different here, but I liked everyone's thoughts and would like to get some feedback on my situation.
I have been diagnosed with pmr about 6 months ago.  My doctor wanted to start me on 20 but I asked if I could start on 10 and am so glad I did.  Within 3 days I felt 90% better.  Slowly I have been weaning off and am now down to 3 milligrams of prednisone however, I am not as comfortable as I was on the dose of 4 and am thinking about going back up but want to wait another week or so and see if I can adjust.
My diet is vegan and has been for many years.  I try not to touch sugar, certainly not anything with white sugar.  I exercise regularly with weights and walking, etc.  Lately the weights have been really hurting me and we have cut way back.  My question is about weight lifting.. Is it a good thing to do?
Also, is there anything else that can be done for the pain besides prednisone?  My pain is especially in my upper arms and it is hard to get in and out of clothing in the morning... by the late afternoon I am always much better.. I assume that is natural for this disease?
thanks,
Judy

"I have been in treatment for PMR for about a year, undiagnosed for 20 months prior to treatment.  I really overdid it and feel that I'm experiencing a flare.  A friend invited us on a hiking trip.  I had no idea that we would be hiking all day at altitude.  On my way home I was hit with a wave of fatigue followed by a 101.6 fever.  Then came the muscle spasms and pain. The fever is back to low grade after 3 days, but I continue with severe fatigue and a bad case of vertigo.  I was on 8 mg of prednisone prior to the flare.  Went back up to 10mg for a couple days.  Now back at 8mg.  Feeling pretty darn miserable.  Should I go back to a higher dose of prednisone?  Any other suggestions?

"I have recently discovered that splitting my dose (currently 15 mg) and taking half at 7 p.m. and half at 9 a.m. makes a huge difference in my pain levels, both in the evening and upon waking. Yea for me! My primary doctor warns me that taking prednisone in the ""afternoon"" can suppress adrenal function more than at other times and may make it more difficult to taper. Any thoughts, experience with this? I have been taking prenisone for about 18 months and have never gotten below 12.5 mg. Also, have read many posts on the split dose subject and understand that the results are highly individualized. Thank you.

"I am having to get up every hour at night to urinate. It's not just a sensation but a large volume every tie. I've always had the opposite problem of retaining liquids.
I looked it up and apparently it is quite a common side effect of predisone as it alters circadian rhythm.
It disrupts my sleep and my energy level is surely affected by having to wake up at least once every hour to pee which is also confusing as to whether the pain in my legs is caused by PMR or dehydration. I am taking potassium, magnesium and calcium along with the vitamin D.
I've been taking the predisone at 2 am. Would it help to take it at another hour? It's kind of ironic that I take it at 2 am precisely to mimic the natural circadian rhythm of cortisol production.

"I am currently on 7mg Prednisolone having reduced gradually from 20mg in March when I was first diagnosed with PMR. Apart from her slight stiffness, mainly in my fingers, when I first get up, I'm fine apart from feeling extremely tired, physically, and shaky. This usually lasts until around 1 - 2pm. when my energy level starts to increase and by about 4pm I feel, what I would call almost normal. In the evening I usually feel great. Does anyone else feel like this ? or can someone please explain why this happens? It has become gradually worse since reducing from 10mg. My GP doesn't seem to have an answer. Obviously I would much prefer to have the fatigue in the evening rather than the morning which is my busiest time.

"My Ruhamatoligist has me splitting my dosage between morning and evening. He recommended this procedure because i was ok during the early periods of the day but I started cramping up and having vision problems in the evening (GCA). Since splitting the dose I have seldom had any problems except for 3 or 4 days after I reduce my dose by the standard 10% or having too many carbs.
I assume that during periods of normal activity the adrenal gland substitute provided by prednisone is used by the body at a fairly standard rate; however, during periods of stress I also assume that more of the chemical is used which left me short in the evening. Can any one on this forum explain how this really works?
Eileen, I will discuss your reduction method with my rheumatologist but I would like to know if you split you doses.

"imagine a rocky shore. In the morning the tide is out, the rocks are uncovered. By afternoon the tide comes in and covers the rocks. It sometimes leaves some uncovered. Overnight it goes out again and uncovers the rocks.
The amount of rocks uncovered is roughly how much pain/stiffness I have from the pmr.
Inflammation increasing is like the tide going out. The pred reduces the inflammation, the tide comes in and reduces the symptoms.
When we talk about how much pain/stiffness we tolerate I'm never too sure whether its at its worst, in the morning, when the tide is out, or at its least worst, in the afternoon, when the pred takes effect and the tide is in.
I assume the morning.
Stable is when the tide goes in and out the same amount every day. The pain/stiffness is the same as the day before.
Stable and no pain is when the rocks are covered in the morning and the tide is going in and out the same amount each day - difficult to tell as we can't see the rocks. 
Reducing from 3.5mg/day to 3mg/day I noticed that over several days the pain/stiffness level in the morning was increasing a little each day.
As if the tide was coming in less each day, and going out further.
My fingers have been the best indicator for quite a while. Wrist pain was added, and a twinge or two in upper arms, where it all started a couple or more years ago.
Toughing it out in the hope it was ""withdrawal"" was really not an option once things got to the stage I couldn't peel an orange.
So. I considered a few options.
1. do nothing, wait and see some more.
2. Have a high enough dose of pred for a day or two to have the tide come in all the way and cover the rocks completely then return to the 3.5mg at which things would be in equilibrium.
3. Return to 3.5mg and see if equilibrium would be reached after a few days
4. Increase a bit until stable and embark on slow reduction again.
I opted for 2. Particularly since that had worked once before with minor shingles attack.
A couple of days of 8mg, a couple of days of 5mg, then back to 3.5mg/day. So far stable.
Returning to 3.5mg was attractive until I realised it may have been only just enough, that inflammation and pred were in equilibrium. Which would mean not enough pred to reduce the excess inflammation. The tide would come in and go out at its new level, leaving rocks still uncovered.
Increasing to 5mg and slowly reducing as in a normal taper seemed attractive until I thought of the longer time to achieve reduced pain and the longish time to taper all over again.
So, a couple of days of higher pred, to have the tide cover the rocks.
It then occurred to me that if the build up of inflammation due to pmr and the reduction due to pred were in equilibrium, that the tide was coming in and out the same every day then the best equilibrium would be where the rocks were just covered every morning, that the incoming tide would just mean deeper water over the rocks.
Just thinking out loud really. The pred dose to be pain free in the morning when pred is taken may be the same dose at which we feel the same amount of pain at the same time each day.
Perhaps including a comment from some time ago about a medical practitioner with pmr who took a lot of pred for a bit then none for a while until symptoms returned. Basically lots of deep water over the rocks which steadily becomes less each day.
Thus, there may be two parts to pred. One is whether we return to the same condition every day at the same time, that we are stable, the second is whether we have residual pain/stiffness or not.
So, for me 3.5mg may be the stable dose. But I can be stable with a bit of pain or with no pain. Its still 3.5mg/day for equilibrium.
Of course I'm really never too sure what a flare looks like. I think I'm lucky. This was more like a slow smoulder.

"Well, I was taking the powder version of Tumeric daily, for 2 weeks.  After 1 1/2 weeks of taking Tumeric, I felt I was getting some benefit from it as my ankle and wrists seemed to be doing better in terms of pain.  Then I began noticing unusual drying of my skin on my face; to the point it was itching and flaking (even though I was heavily applying moisturizers).  An itching rash began to appear on the corners and partially on the lid of my left eye, forehead and all around my lip/chin are area.  The only change to my diet was the Tumeric.  I stopped taking it and after 2 days began to see an improvement in my skin.  After one week, the rash is almost all gone.  I'm debating as to whether I should start taking the Tumeric again to actually confirm that that was the cause of the rash.  (Not looking forward to the rash again, but that would make my suspicion conclusive).  Has anyone had this reaction to Tumeric?
?Also, I am holding my own at 1 1/2 mg of Medrol and will taper to 1 1/4 mg in a couple of days.  I had a stressful evening last night and thought I was getting sympotoms; however, I calmed myself down and felt better.  (I cannot discuss politics with Liberals - it's a losing battle and I cannot let it affect my health!)
?Lastly, I had a follow up appointment with my Ophthalmologist.  I expressed that I would ocassionally get a sharp pain in my right eye.  He said the right eye was very dry (also can be due to my age) and suggested I use over-the-counter drops for dry eye; which I do use, but not dilligently.  Eye pressure was very good and I did great on the visual test he gave me.  However, he did caution me to pay attention to any sudden loss of vision, temple pain, lasting headaches; which I already know from my Rheumatologist.  He will see me again in 1 year unless I notice any changes.
?Routine Bloodwork next week and follow-up with my Rheumy the week after.

"I have been on predisone 15mg.for 2 weeks now, and before that, I was on some other time release cortisone injections for a week. I had had PMR symptoms since the end of April.
I'm not sure if I started on the right dosis or that maybe I have GCA as well, I've had headaches, blurry, foggy vision that the ophthalmologist said was due to a common vitrious detachment and nightsweats.
I've had to change rheumatologists, my new GP has referred me but I couldn't get an appointment till December 15th, till which time, I'm basically on my own. By that time, I should be starting to reduce from 12.5 to 10. It would be a shame if I had to taper up rather than down which I should be able to do in 3 weeks time.
Despite everything I've learned on here, I'm still not sure if I'm on the right dose for PMR, as so far my symptoms have been on a roller coaster. Some days I can walk normally, even having to reign myself in as I tend to feel like D. Bunny, but for the last two days, for example, my legs seem to be so weak that they buckle when I walk.. very unsteady and constant pain in my leg muscles . I've also developed restless leg syndrome which I experienced during pregnancy but never since.
I read a post on here from 2009 by a member describing his onset of GCA which I related to.
I'm hoping that everything will become clearer when I get the results of my CRP and ESR levels back on Wednesday, they were only slightly elevated before diagnosis.
Dea, you were diagnosed with both PMR and ESH at the same time recently. Could you describe your experience? I apologize if its already on here already . I think I've read all the relevant posts and then I discover something new.

"I have had back pain for 10 years before I got PMR. I assumed that once I started on pred that my back would improve but it's done just the opposite. It is worse then ever. The rheumatologist took an X-ray and said I have arthritis in my SI joint. I also have arthritis in my facet joints according to my pain management doctor.
So my question is do you think that PMR is causing this pain? I first started out at 15 mg and that just wasn't enough so we upped it to 20 mg for two weeks. Then dropped down to 15 mg for two weeks and then 12.5 for two weeks, and finally I'm on 10 mg for four weeks. I know alot of you will say that that is dropping to fast and I know it is but I did what the doc said to do not really knowing any better at the time. I never had any relief from back pain on the, 20 mg so I don't think preds going to work for that.

"ONE quick warning:  if your blood sugar is fine, God Bless You and good luck to you, but if you DON'T KNOW if your blood sugar is fine, get it checked out.  Pred can be alwfully damaging, and sugar is one of its favorite ways of causing it.  And now a word on taking pred at night...
I'd switched over to a night time dose of prednisone, because it elevates blood sugar most strongly in the first 12 hours, and while it still has impact, its much weaker in the second half.
It was a rocky road to success, because it turns out that while i don't eat anything between the hours of 10pm and 8am, my liver is hard at work pumping out sugar like billy-o.   It took me awhile to figure out how to fix that, and in the end maybe I just got lucky.
First, I must eat like a good little diabetic, and I'm getting better at it all the time.
Second, I've figured out that while exercise can draw sugar out of the blood, you've got to stage your eating so that you eat during the day and little at night.
There is an old saying, breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dine like a pauper, and it works, although I generally make lunch my biggest meal.  I have also found that if I finish my smallish dinner by 5 pm and eat no more, that my blood settles down late at night and gets no higher than the 120's, which is safe if above normal.
During the day, I've reached a point where my post prandial blood levels are as normal as any non diabetic even without exercise!  I do have one cheat:  Metformin, otherwise known as glucophage.  I can't be sure if and how much its helping, but I suspect that it is.  Bottom line, the night time dosing is working and my A1C level should be well below six, although its unlikely to go below 5 while I'm on prednisone.

"I was diagnosed with PMR about 2.5 yrs ago and presently down to 5 mg prednisone and may been there for 3 months on advice of rheumy after a flare up when i tried to get down to 4.  I recently had an ACTH and cortisol tests from my endocrinologist even though i am still on prednisone.  The results showed that my acth was 12 and cortiosol 8.  She indicated these were on the low normal side  for someone on steroids and would have been only concerned if the numbers were high.  She does feel i likely have secondary adrenal insufficiency due to the long term prednisone use.  She said i should have a card or med alert bracelet for that.
Has anyone had any experience with these tests? I am little concerned about the validity of tests particularly while on prednisone and what the results indicate if anything.  Any feedback from all you great folks is appreciated.

"Club Swagger  Club Zero   Club Fear
I want to take a victory lap.
I want to say good riddance.
I want the objects in the rear view mirror to be 
           smaller than they really are.
I want the 50 pounds gained and lost in the last

I want to dump my bottles of prednisone.
But this systemic demon has bitten twice!
Damn him for his residence.

Will I ever get my swagger back?
The clouds then lifted .
slowly, weight down, pred down, 
walk, road bike, love
again.
Things I thought I might never have.
Here am I, back, but I keep the little white pills.
Just in case.

"Each time I try to go from 11mg to 10.5mg I will have an increase in my PMR symptoms within 24 hours.
Is this considered withdrawal symptoms in which case I should maintain the lower dose and put up with the symtoms until it eventually resolves ?
Or, is this considered a flare-up in which case I should go back up to the 11mg since it will not resolve ?
Obviously this is important to know since the ""solution"" is very different.
Thanks

"Two weeks ago I was on 7.5mg (down from 10mg 4 weeks previously).
I experienced leg pain and the Doc put the dose up to 10mg again. After three days the pain went. I foolishly went walking around London for longer than I usually walk -- not feeling any pain. The next and subsequent days I have suffered terribly with muscle pain at the top of my legs and cannot walk far or stand for long - have to keep sitting down. I think that I must have overdone it as the Doc has told me in the past that steroids can cause muscle weakness.
Has anyone suffered like this after overdoing it? How long does it take to recover?

"This might be a question of enough general interest to post it. 
Is there guidance on altering dosage of prednisone in order to test whether you're on the correct dose or not?
Let me make it specific. I am on 7.5mg a day of medrol. I've had that dosage for 3 months. I feel that my PMR is not under sufficient control. I am mobile and functional but stiffness and pain are a bit more than I would like. Could I, eg, bump up to 10 mg for a week (say), gauge my symptoms at that level and then drop to 9 mg after the first week and see how that felt? Or is there a suggested process for trying to optimize the dosage?
What I do NOT want to do is change the dosage too much or too quickly.
Does anyone have any experience or have you found any guidance in the literature?

"Hi all. Just wondered if any of you have had any of the following ailments suddenly appear whilst reducing preds. All seem to have happened since I have got down from 25mg 2.5 years ago to my current 13mg (which I seem to be stuck on at the moment).
1. I have started getting what I believe to be arthritis in the middle fingers of each hand, not at the same time but suddenly they start to ache and within 24 hours swell up. If I increase preds to 15mg a day for two or three days it slowly subsides back to normal.
2. Every morning I tend to wake up, get out of bed and within 2 or 3 steps get sudden pain down my right leg from top to bottom (may be sciatic). this seems to be wear off after an hour or so and not return until the following morning.
3. I seem to have an excess of phlegm (sorry) which I have heard can be a side affect of preds, does any one suffer from this as well.
Any advice will be most welcome and best wishes to you all, Dave (tavidu)

Additional tests bore out her conclusion that I do not have glaucoma. I need to go back in 6 months. It was such a relief to get a pass, at least for now.

"Cross posted -  I am new and I am sorry if I am doing this wrong - I responded to a message on a board about the age of diagnosis (<50) of PMR ..  . probably better starting my own thread . . .
 For the past 6 months I have had a moderately elevated CRP level and ESR, pain and stiffness in hips, feet, neck and sometimes elbows - some days it is hard for me to get down the stairs in the morning and I am frequently tired.  I have been tested for Lyme, RA, Hashimotos, Lupus and Vascultis and menopause (all my ovarian function was tested).  Thyroid has been tested several times.   GP sent me to a rheumy.  The rheumy he referred to retired. Found one through insurance who did a CBC, ANCA Panel and UA  (all totally normal) and told me there was no rheumatological reason for my elevations and to get a chest, abdominal and pelvic CT to rule out malignancy and a pair of Birkenstocks.  My ESR was in the 49-55 range (so not terribly elevated - CRP 9-10) (tested three times) and my CBC and UA was totally and completely normal.  Anyhow, I just turned 46 and he told me I can't have PMR because I am not 50.   My GP initially suspected PMR (found out after I shared my CT referral)  and I am now seeking a consult at Johns Hopkins before I undergo the CT. Besides the notion of a screening for malignancy being scary - the CT seems sort of unnecessary at this point - given the fact that I show no other signs of malignancy at this point. It is very frustrating and I can't help but to think that the percentage chance of me having PMR, despite my age, is greater than the chance of having an underlying malignancy. I am just concerned I am going to have to deal with this for the next four years UGH!  How much damage does the actual inflammation do to your body in the long term?  I am not even sure Hopkins will see me - you have to send your records before you can get an appointment.  GP said he is not comfortable diagnosing me because he does not see enough PMR cases.  Sorry for the rambling - just wanted to share with people who may have been through this.

"and my tablets were still in the med box for that day. Too late to take them so I prepared for possible effects. I'm currently fighting OA in knees and hips with something else in thighs that could be my PMR. At any rate I'm forcing myself onto the tennis court for an hour at a time to keep from being permanently in the recliner. It is now the following day and nothing strange in  the way of general PMR symptoms have evolved. I'm just at the beginning of 4.0mg dosage having stayed at 4.5 for about two months. Although I have tried to blame dosage reduction on many of my pains, I cannot be certain because of the other issues such as OA. I am almost 86 and have been fighting PMR for about 30 months. So I am posting this to ask if I should have expected anything unusual in the way of pain etc. or is there a delay involved. Or is it an indicator that I am out of the woods as far as PMR is concerned.

"I thought I'd give an early report of how my sugar is doing since I've switched to night time.  Its only been a week, and that means its too early to say my prednisone (currently at 10mg but reducing to 9mg DSNS) is weaker during the day when I need it.  So far so good, but I believe at least 2 or even 3 weeks will tell the take better.
Two set the scene up, I used to take my pred at 7:30 AM sharp ( I take it at 10 PM now).  I ate like a good little diabetic, and exercised a LOT, especially after meals.  It worked...mainly, but occasionally the carpentry would poke through the upholstery, and I'd get a spike in the 170's or so.  Very naughty when you're trying to keep post prandial blood tests under 140 at all times to eliminate organ damage.
Now, I never have bad morning spikes.  Its rare for post prandial tests to be over 120...very rare, and that means my readings are pretty darn normal.  I'm speaking in mg/dl here as Americans do (normal fasting 75 to 92, post prandial normal just under 120), but take my word for it, my numbers are good, and nothing ANY doctor would take a second look at.  That means my next A1C number should also be good.
Or would be BUT....there's trouble right here in River City.  My night time numbers used to be within normal limits, or at least low enough limits not to cause damage.  Now however, it seems that Pred and my liver are coluding to have a sugar party in the middle of the night.  Initial readings were hitting as high as 170 or so by 4 or 5 AM, settling down to a disappointing, but acceptable 120 by morning.
I've therefore added in a 15 minute treadmill session at 9:45 just before I take my dose.  It helps.  My sugar sometimes drops from the 90's to as low as 75.  Then my night numbers don't get higher than 140 or so.  Barely acceptable, and that's not what I'm working hard for.  So....I'm adding back in a medication I'd stopped taking:  Metformin.  You might know it as Glucophage, but I suppose it has 10 other names too, especially over seas.  Its the first line of defense for Diabetes Type II here in the US.  I'm trying to see now if Metformin can compete with pred at night well enough to bring my numbers a bit lower.
That's it, but I've a final word of caution:  my Rheumy wasn't even SLIGHTLY interested, nor is he still in my blood sugar.  Even though he well knows pred can cause this issue, he left it completely up to me to find out about it, and deal with it, which I ultimately have with my GP.  I know have some...I believe its called...neuropathy in my feet.  Thank you doctor ""I don't care"".  The lesson, take your health into your own hands.  Make sure you don't have a sugar problem from your pred.  Find out what your sugar looks like, and learn what it ought to be.  Why put PMR in remission only to have a heart attack or a stroke, or lose kidney function?

I hope you are all well.
I thought I was, with the help and advice I have gained from this forum.
Diagnosed in May with pmr, down from 15mg to 8.
I have tried hard with pacing and a little acceptance.
However, last Thursday gardening, Friday felt rubbish, Saturday felt fine. . .
From Sunday I have been in agony, legs arms etc.
This has been as bad as when I reduced steroids from 12.5-10.
I don't understand why I felt fine on Saturday to how dreadful I feel at the moment, do I increase steroids back up to 9 as painkillers have no affect.
If I ask my rheumatologist he wil say no to increase and plus I will have to through hell week all over again.

down to 10mg. Started Metotrexate 6 weeks ago and on 20mg.

My liver enzymes have risen and so has my kidney levels.

rule out lupas, rhematic arthritis and other conditions.
My question is what is he looking for and why after 7 months

"Having gradually tapered down to 8mg over about 18 months I seem to be having increased symtoms. Not a flare up but pain here and there. First of all I was having problems with my hands, being stiff and painful in the morning and so I gradually increased back up to 12mg and then down again and am currently on 10mg. My shoulders are not great and are worse at night. To deal with this I split the dose, taking 3mg before going to sleep and 7mg at about 5.00am in the morning. This hasn't worked and I am wondering whether to split the dose more in favour of the evening, or whether to increase the dose again. I am also having problems with my back which my ostiopath says he thinks are do to with PMR because the pain is caused by inflamation (confirmed by MRI). I can only stand for a few minutes, athough sitting down is OK, even on a bike! So, I don't know whether to go back to quite a high dose and really try and knock these problems on the head but am worried that if I do this, whether it works or not, I then have to taper all over again, which will be a real bore, especially if it does not work.

One and a half years ago my PMR started with loaded pain and aching. After weeks, the prednisone seemed to reduce that to constant, daily exhaustion. I was down to 10 pred., but have had flareups and just yesterday SO reluctantly went from 20 t0 25 because of aching across shoulders & arms. Has anyone or a dr. quantified the amount we ""should""  endure, or must we try to eliminate all aching? Also, while taking calcium supplement, has ANYONE seen obvious adverse effects from the prednisone? My mother was on pred. 20 YEARS with her GCA and didn't, but I don't want to try or face that.

I have been last two weeks to physio, had very gentle massage/acupunture, only result beeing I actually got a few hours sleep!
My question is.....I know I have to up the dose again (much to horror of doc and rheumie)  but how come if I up to say 12mg the pain eases, or higher, and then drop quicker to 10mg again it halts the pain, but can start lowering......why dosen`t it ease the pain on the slow method??
Eileen for example, has said she had to up her dose several months ago.....it eased her symptoms, and she was able to drop to lower dose quick again....but why is that....I just don`t understand....what am I missing here.....
I know I have two things going on, but it certainly is more PMR pain.....everyone seems hell bent on getting me off pred......I wish!  would be happy just to be at 5mg and stay there!

I reduced by sometimes 10mgs other times by 5mgs, the longest time I was on a dose 6 weeks ,the shortest 10 days. I have now been on 20mgs. since May. My bloods were still high and I was sent for a PET/CT scan in June which showe no signs of further inflammation. My last Rheum.appointment was in July whrn I was told to keep on 20mgs. I have never felt better since Nov. than I do now. My G.P. recently took blood and has now referred me to a Haematologist because my white blood cells have risen, he says they are 19 and should be 12, I was wondering if anyone else has has had this.

"I live in Australia and his disease is not well known here. I think I have had it for 26 years undiagnosed and this year by June I could not longer do more than walk a few steps and required assistance to do everything else.
I was taken into a small country hospital and a german Dr diagnosed the condition and started me on 50mg of Pred. Great relief but side effects are causing a few problems.
I am trying to get the Pred dosage down and my doctor has given me free rein as he has never seen a case of the disease, nor any of the other 5 doctors in the practice.
When diagnosed my feet were also sore and painful and both hands, but right hand was so badly swollen that I could not bend any joints at all.
In the 90's it was deemed that I had a back problem but they could not see the damage that would cause the pain so it was passed off that I was ""putting it on"". One doctor though, did prescribe Voltaren and I think that may have helped.
I can now walk around and look after myself and have back used of my hands. But joints are still sore and muscles hurt most of the day till I lay flat in bed.
I am down to 17.5mg of Pred, but if l do any activity such as vacuuming or gardening and mowing the lawn, or shopping, I find l am very sore for the next couple of days.
I am 74 and live on my own, and at Christmas time was very active. The disease has always affected me in Australian winters but never as bad as this year.
As no one seems to know much about this over here, can someone tell me, is Voltaren an alternative drug?
Am I trying to get the dosage down too fast?
What is normal?
My CRP and ESR levels have dropped dramatically on Pred.
SIide effects of tunnel vision (no I do not have GCA) bloating, heart palpitations, indigestion are some of the side effects.
Help!!!!

"Currently on 9mg Prednisolone having started at 20mg in March. Virtually no pain or stiffness which is great and energy levels not too bad although I do have to rest quite frequently.  My problem is, that since I reduced to 9mg 2 weeks ago (was previously on 10mg for 6 weeks) I wake up feeling nervous, uptight and anxious and and would like nothing more than to curl up and go back to sleep.  Needless to say I don't give in to this feeling and carry on as best I can during the day in fact I probably over compensate by doing too much as I find that keeping busy helps to take my mind off myself.  I've always had a tendency towards anxiety and panic attacks but since the onset of PMR this has been a lot better, until now.  Is this something that can be exacerbated when reducing Pred and if so, how do other people cope (if they have this problem)?  I can function perfectly normally but inside I'm a wreck. I feel shaky and am also prone to hot sweats, particularly at night.  Any help or advice would be greatly apprecitaed.  Thank you.

"I enjoy reading all the contributions from members of this forum it makes me feel I'm not the only one going through this pmr minefield.
At present I have just reduced to 9mg per day and I am far from being pain free. I have been down this road so many times in the last 2 1/2 years and can honestly say that even on 20mg I am still in pain. The only time pred really worked for me was the first time I took it at a dosage of 20mg. Neither my GP nor myself know how to treat this very painful condition. My GP is sending me to see a rheumatologist at the end of the month to see how to manage it better or to look and see if it might be an altogether different condition.
I was really hoping I would go into remission or beat this altogether but so far nothing! l'm really tired all the time and getting quite depressed too.But having said so I still fight every inch of the way and make myself do things and go out etc. I hope there is someone out there who could give me some advice as to what I should do or expect to do to try and feel better.

"After a suggestion by Nick to help control my blood sugar, I'm migrating my prednisone dose from my usual 7:30AM dose of 10 MG to taking the entire thing at night.  Prednisone elevates blood sugar somewhat, but the worst thing it does is impede muscles and organs from taking up excess sugar.  So the plan is to take my 10 MG at night at say, 10:30 PM, and then by approximately 9 AM the following morning the bulk of the effect will be over with, and controlling my blood sugar during the day could become a trivial thing.
Issues:  Possibly even more difficulty sleeping at night, and what if it stimulates the liver to produce yet more sugar during the night?  I'm also concerned that while I'm moving about I might get a lesser amount of protection from the pred given that I took it the previous night before.  If it works, and side effects are minimal, I can control my blood sugar more easily, and have a more normal life.
To try this out, I'm moving my dose 1 hour earlier each night.  Tonight I'll be woken at 4 AM for my dose.  At this rate it will take me 6 nights more to get to 10:30 PM at night.  I could have staggered the dose in the other direction, but as you'll see below I'm starting in on a nice and slow DSNS to 9 MG, and thought under the circumstances that a sooner and stronger dose while I'm moving the time is better than a longer an weaker dose.
So as I've said, I've also started a DSNS reduction from 10 to 9 MG, and I'm using exactly the one posted online here, so lowering 1 mg is going to take more than a month.  Hopefully slow and sure wins the race.

"For over 2 months I have had a headache on and off, the last 3 weeks its come with neck pain and its so annoying. I have had 2 blood tests at my doctors and both had esr of 29 im a 23 yr old female. I saw a doctor who was a locum and said that wa high for my age and put me on anti biotics as she said i had sinus infection. Yesterday I see the normal doctor who is the manager of the surgery and i havent seen him before because Im worried about a vein/artery on my righ side on my forehead. You cannot see it but you can feel it a bit more than you can on the left side. I have been readin g up about gca and im getting worried. My partner and the doctor said they both feel the same but I can feel it a bit more (raised) on the right side than I can on the left. My doctor didnt seem too fussed about it yesterday but he seemed more worried about my posture and apparently thats causing the headaches. Im more worried about this on my forehead. I dont know how long its been like that it could of been there for ever but Ive only recently noticed it an im worried. Thanks.

I am in 5th year of pred...got PMR for my 60th birthday!....have lowered in past with flares, and always had to go back up to where I started 15mg.....I am down to 10mg now (yesterday).....dr is leaving it to me, told her I`m doing the dead slow method, because rheumie wanted me off fast and always had flares.....because I have fibro as  well....(20 years)...it is very tricky.....
I  now have a lot of  low back/pelvic/leg pain which I haven`t really struggled so much with before...It is difficult to sit stand or walk....
I have been to physio twice, had light massage, and acupuncture....which helps for a few hours, but she is wary of treating me (and I agree) until I am settled at this dose, and we both agree that until we kno what is doing this....lowering/flare/physio/PMR?....it`s seems a minefield to work it out.....but with this pain and fatigue.....I just wish I had the answer!

"I was diagnosed with PMR and TA 6 and half years ago.  Since seeing the consultant then, I have never had a follow up examination and have been attending my GP for ESR results etc.   I have just come of the predisolone and over the past few weeks am feeling quite ""down""...  Im getting stiffer each day and tired all the time.
The problem is,  is this how I should feel?  Will it get better?   My doctor is great but to be honest feel he doesnt know too much about polymyalgia.  The other question is that I have only been on at the most 5mg over the past 5 years and been gradually trying to get off the steroids as Ive been on them so long.
The muscles at the top of my arms are a bit achey but nothing much, but walking about I am in not pain just extremely stiff (walking like a penguin).  I am beginning to think that at my age perhaps I should take a chance an go back on the steroids - cos everything is a bit miserable at the moment.  Any one else been on long term steroids?    Thanks for any input or advice.

"Hi Eileen and everyone!
I saw the consultant rheumy on Monday and she was great. Spent a lot of time listening to my story, asking lots and questions and examining my joints - seeing what I could move and what was tender.
She is concerned that as I had a painful neck and shoulders, then hip and pelvis, then tops of the arms that I may not have PMR. She used ultra sound to scan the ligaments in my arms, and could not see anything much - just a slight collection of fluid in the left arm which is not as painful. The scan is becoming a test for PMR. 
I told her I had read the BSR journal paper on the Bristol protocol and could I please have a week's trial of pred. She agreed, BUT said she was not convinced so did some more blood tests for RA, a CCP which the GP cannot do. Plus I had X-rays of my feet and neck as she was not happy with my limited movement. 
I get the results this week. She said she did not want to treat PMR if I really had an atypical RA presentation, as pred would sort out the pain, but not prevent the joint damage so I would need the new DMARDs for RA.
I felt dramatically better after a few hours on pred- I could run up the stairs!!! On Monday night I was in such pain I thought about sleeping downstairs as I was in such pain just trying to lift my legs.
After 48 hours the pain has gone from my legs, but my right shoulder is bad so I am taking ibruprofen again. I can get out of bed easily, have no morning stiffness, can get dressed easily, I can walk up and down stairs, even pick something off the floor. The only problem is I am so fatigued I have had to go to bed by mid day. I also feeling like I am a bit spaced out. I went into the charity where I am a trustee and could not follow the meeting.
Any ideas?

"I've been dealing with PMR for the past 3 yrs on a decending dose of prednisone (from 20mg to 10mg  to 1.5mg currently). I'm in the throes of a major flare & will no doubt have to increase the dosage. My MD recommended 10 mg but I suggested starting at 5 & see where that takes me first. He's ok with that. I suspect that wherever I end up will be where I'll have to stay for a very long time. I suspect my adrenals are already compromised. I've consulted a nutritionist to see what I can do nutritionally about helping the adrenals heal but I'm not terribly encouraged right now. I'd like some feedback regarding diet, etc. in bringing the adrenals back on line & doing their job!  Thanks much & good luck to all of you out there!

"My chiro says many of his patients with PMR have it burn out between 5 and 7 years!  If I am right I've seen it said here that about 25% of people have it go away by the 5th year but correct me if I am wrong.  In any event I mention this because my chiropractor 'blew me away' with his remark because it seemed to me that one had to be really lucky for PMR to go away AT ALL!  I've had it 3 years and keep trying to taper slowly but back it comes with a vengeance!  I'm at 7 mg of Cortisone now, (it's similar to Prednisione), and yes even with my flares up I don't have to increase it a lot but I really find it hard to believe I can ever get it much below 5.  Have any you seen or heard encouraging comments like those of my chiro, and I don't mean like one or two cases only where the PMR went away?

"It seems we certainly are not alone in people forgetting we are ill, or at least  not taking our usual chores or activities for grsnted. Who has a suggestion that will remind people, especially our spouses, that underneath this facade are definite pains, aches, and/or terrible fatigue without making them angry? There must be a better way than having one's arm in a sling or carrying around a crutch or cane. With Halloween approaching soon, one might readily find sales of Freddy Krueger or Michael Myers masks--but that would frighten everybody including ourselves. I've resorted to simply wearing a Peanuts band-aid on my finger. My wife knows why, and she thereby remembers, and others wonder why an 80 year old guy is wearing a Snoopy band-aid. It works for me (and gives me a chance to share why I idolize everything Charles Schulz has done), but I'm sure you all may have better reminders to those around us without aggravating them?

"Partly in response to Flipdovers ""what I hate"" thread (Hiya Flip), I thought I would go the opposite way and start this conversation.
I have been off sick for one year now. Dx'd in December '15, started on 25mg and now sitting on 10mg for a few weeks before tapering again.
I was wondering if anybody else feels as I do. I dont really mind having this thing. Dont get me wrong, I would much rather it wasn't hanging around, but as I've always been fit and healthy, I knew that as I  reach 60 (this Dec) that I would probably be succeptable to one of the serious illnesses. Well it hit me bad when it did come, but after 9 or 10 months on pred I seem to have a bit of control over it. There are so many things that I could have got (and still could I know) that this one is one of the more favourable ones to have got.
It has changed my life and outlook completely. I try not to look on the negative things and try to see the good in situations now. OK, I cant do a lot of the things that I used to enjoy, running was something that was akin to meditation for me and financially we're in a bit of a pickle but it has given be time to re-adjust and re-align myself. 
I still have my moments when I get fed up with some of the pains and sleepless night etc. 
I dont like being on steroids but the alternative is far worse. When I remember how it felt, physically and emotionally before my diagnosis when I thought I was going mad because they couldn't tell me what was wrong, I find myself sitting, because of the fatigue or aches, just thinking of what it was like a year ago and count my blessings.
Still can't do a press up but I will one day.

"Hi there just thought I would update you how things are going on now.
 I was diagnosed with PMR in July after weeks of really bad pain and stiffness I was put on 15mg predisilone on the wed which I took  at 5pm with my main meal re dr instructions on the Thursday morning 85% of the pain had gone it was like a miracle over the next week the pain had disappeared almost  completely I took this for 5 weeks in total had another blood test inflammation levels were much improved I thought gp told me to reduce then to 7.5mg although people on the forum were saying the reduction was far to much however I took these for two weeks with no breakthrough pain but I had to check something with my GP and she told me I was wrong she had said 12.5mg although I said I had no breakthrough pain she still wanted me to go up to 10mg which I did for a month I have just reduced again and I'm now on 7.5mg all well at the moment except for the side effects although the dizziness and the slight shaking hands have gone sleeping is a big problem although I have switched to taking the pred with my breakfast it has not made any difference to sleeping also I'm fed up of having the headache.
 I made a decision not to take Alendronic Acid that the GP perscribed in the absence of a bone scan to prove  I needed it and which they seem to think I don't need I do take Adcal 2x daily.

"I could not remember when the stiffness around my shoulders and hips started. I got used to the difficult task to put my socks on without being able to bend at the hips, to wash my hair by lifting one arm with the other and change my golf swing to something very short and stiff. Picking a ball from the hole was also a different job. And then it got slowly so bad that I could not turn over in bed or get out of bed, while I was every morning drenched with night sweat. I called my GP and told the symptoms to the nurse. I had to get to the lab to provide blood etc before I met with him. When I met he suspected PMR even though ESR was 27, but CRP was 90. I had all the textbook PMR symptoms. My reaction to Prednisolone was miraculous. I took 12mg at 2PM and was playing golf with a fuller swing than in years at 4:30! Total freedom all at once. I really thought this was great! My GP sent me to the Rheumatologist, but also immediately put me on 10mg Prednisone. Since I felt good perhaps I did too much, but a week later I got stabbing pain in my left chest when breathing in. To the ER and diagnosed with Pleurisy. After 2 weeks on 10mg and extensive tests to try to find an alternative for the PMR, my dose of pred was increased to 15mg. After 2 more weeks still with fever, nightsweats, headache and stabbing pleurisy, but no stiffness or pain in my shoulders I was increased to 20mg. Pleurisy disappeared and slowly (now 4 weeks on 20mg) also the fever and nightsweats are improving. Went back to work and found out the stress does indeed set things off again. So every other day now I still have the low fever, nightsweats and headache. I am now asked to lower to 17.5mg and am not sure if that is the right thing to do.
Has anyone else seen the Pleurisy?

"Since prednisone treatment, my PMR switched from pain to severe, daily exxhaustion. Seems there are no pills for that. Some suggest forced exercise. That's like telling someone with flu to exercise.  I have occasionally forced myself into some chores and nearly collapsed from the effort. The condition is not only debilitating, it triggers bouts of mental anxiety. Has anyone found any form of relief?

"I could use some advice.  I'm seeing my Rheumatologists Nurse Practitioner Friday AM.
My situation:  I was off pred for 1 month plus in order to get rid of a flare up of Epstein Barr.  That's all gone, and I was started back on Sept 6th at 10MG.  That dose has me feeling pretty good.  So much so that I do more than an hour of walking a day.  However,  I do have some lingering pain in my shoulders. 
They want me on a set schedule where I lower 1 mg every 3 weeks.  I already understand and fully BELIEVE that is nuts, and that DSNS is THE way to go.  However, should I be considering upping slightly first to get rid of the shoulder pain, ...its kind of minor, but its real ...or should I just focus on a DSNS plan to move forward from here when I see her? Advice please!!

"I know people here will understand.... I've observed in others that a big part of aging is a series of losses. Now, I've got aging and PMR and the losses are getting to me. I have a strong spiritual life which values acceptance of reality and gratitude for what I have. That's gotten my this far. This morning, though, as I was waking up, I had a pleasant fantasy about a situation in need of help and started developing a plan as to how I could step in and help. That's always been a core value for me, and a great source of satisfaction. Then, reality set in - my plan would necessitate lifting and physical labor that I can no longer do safely. THIS MF HAS EVEN TAKEN MY DREAMS! A line from Langston Hughes, ""Hold fast to dreams, for when dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly."" It didn't help that my love chose today to let me know that my hair is thinning in the back. I started screaming, ""I can't take one more thing!"" But, of course I can. Like I have, and like you all do. It's been a few hours, and I'm getting my emotional equilibrium back, but just want you all to know that I am grateful to have found a compassionate group of people who actually understand. Thank you.

"Anyone have any knowledge or experience with how PMR affects a males PSA levels or vice versa ?
I am a 65 year old male who was diagnosed with PMR in April of this year. Started on 15mg of prednisone and now on 11mg.  Had my annual physical this week and my PSA is 7 ( should be around 4 ). Never had a PSA done previously so nothing to compare this reading to. Now being referred to a urologist for evaluation. 
Started wondering if having an inflammatory disease like PMR and being on prednisone can cause an increas in PSA.  Of even more concern is some studies that I found that showed several cases of patients who were origially diagnosed with PMR that were later found to actually have prostate cancer and the prostate cancer masqueraded as PMR symptoms. When the cancer was treated all the PMR symptoms resolved.
Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

"I have had 4 FBC which have showed some abnormality and I was wondering if other PMR sufferers have had this problem.   My Platelets are High,  WCC slightly High, Basophils High, Neutrophils High, Lymphocytes High, Monocytes slightly low.  Dr. wanting to send me to a Haemotologist, he thinks Prednisone could be causing this, I have been taking it for 17 months now, have gradually tapered down to 8mg on very slow reduction.  Since I have tapered to lower dose I have had these abnormal blood results, when on high Prednisone  50mgs I did not have this problem with FBC.

"Hello all - I have a question about whether my symptoms are normal during tapering.  I'd been on 10mg, tried to taper straight to 9mg - unsuccessful as various aches and pains came back pretty quickly.  I went back up to 10mg until things settled down, then went onto DSNS taper.  All good until I got to 1 day old, 3 days new - on the third day of new (9mg), everything started hurting again.  That was on Thursday.  Admittedly, all the pains weren't nearly as bad as things were at the very start of this journey, but are they part of a normal taper, or it is a sign that I'm reducing too quickly for my body?  
I'm sure I've read somewhere that it's not uncommon for the body to complain a bit during tapering, but the issue is whether things improve over a few days, or get worse.  So I'm confused as to whether to stick it out for a bit longer (how long?) to see if things settle, or if I'm better going back up to 10mg until I get comfortable again and then try tapering by 0.5mg?

"I am about 2.5 yrs into the PMR journey and am a 64 y.o. male now down to 5 mg/day of prednisone but have bounced between 5 and 8 the last few months trying to taper.  My rheumatologist is now trying a much longer taper period and wants me to stay at 5 mg for at least 3 months which i concur with.
?In the past 2 months or so I have developed a newer symtom/issue -  painful burning prickly sensation in both feet which has been quite troublesome.  I reported it to my rheumatiologist at my visit 3 weeks ago and she didn't really have an answer for the cause etc. and suggested it could be plantar faciitis. To be fair to her,  I may not have described the burning painful prickly and somewhat numb feeling I am experiencing but in previous years have had plantar faciitis and know it is nothing like the pain i had with that.  I am going to get back in touch with her about it and wonder if others have or are experiencing such symptoms and may know what could be causing it or what to do about it.  I appreciate any feedback on this issue.  Thanks in advance.

However, once I upped the meds, swelling went down.  Has anyone experienced any of this.  I know that jaw pain is associated with Giant Cell Arteritis but my Rheumatologist insists, I don't have that; I have PMR.

"Hello other members of this really interesting forum.  I am very new to this having just joined and have only so far made one or two comments to other members.  I was first diagnosed with PMR two and a half years ago.  I was put on 20mg a day of prednisolone to reduce to 15mg a day after one month, then 10mg a day after another month and thereby reducing by one a month.  At first the results were almost magical and I felt so much less pain within 24 hours of taking my first prednisolone dose.  I followed my GPs instructions to the letter and a blood test showed that my ESR levels had reduced from 78 to 38.  I was delighted. But the further I reduced the more the pain started to come back. And this has been the pattern over the last 2 and a half years.  The minute I start reducing below about 15mg it all starts returning.  The side effects of predisolone have also been a real worry.  I have put on about 4stone in weight, my eyes are sore all the time, my teeth have been crumbling, I have constant hunger on the high doses and I feel generally miserable and worried.  My GP referred me to a Rheumatologist about a year ago who was most offhand, said he thought I had Firbromyalgia rather than PMR and didn't need to see me again.  My GP and myself did not agree with his diagnosis and still treated my illness as PMR.  I have all the classic signs of PMR with intense pain in the groin area, hips, knees etc.  Everything below the waist mainly.  I haven't really suffered with pains in my arms and shoulders except for the first time I was diagnosed. I have just returned from a lovely holiday and a much needed rest and have been on 20mg a day all that time. But the steroids just don't seem to be working anymore. I am not able to walk very far and am in almost constant pain walking, trying to do the household chores, getting in and out of a car, in and out of bed etc.  In fact almost everything causes me discomfort unless I am just sitting in my chair.  I hate being like this as I have always been an active person, going 3 times a week to a gym etc. But I have been unable to do hardly any exercise since this horrible complaint first started.  My latest blood test on return from my holiday showed that my ESR levels were still 68.  This has prompted my GP to make an urgent referral to a different Rheumatologist to see if we can go deeper into this problem and find another reason why my ESR levels are so high and resistant to the steroids.  I hate being on steroids, I think the side effects are horrendous and take over your life.  Sorry for being so down about this but I would really appreciate other member's opinions and ideas of what I should/could do next. I almost forgot to mention that I am also on BP medication (my BP has risen) and have also been diagnosed with pre-diabetic!

"I used to exercise somewhat often at home until I joined the gym 5 months ago and have been going every week day since signing up.
Something I've noticed is I've had a really bad wrist pain every time I lifted something, or have carried something and it stays for a few minutes. My best relief is to pull the wrist inward (yes this hurts even more but when I let go the wrist hurts a lot less). Another thing that has helped is to lay my wrist down backward, it stops almost all the pain until I lift my hand up again.
I thought this was a muscle strain but I don't think this is the case. I've had a break from the gym for a week before, maybe twice (catching a virus once and back injury the other time). During these breaks from the gym my wrist hasn't stopped hurting the smallest bit.
I've found online that vitamin d deficiency is linked to chronic pain... I'm not sure if what I have is classed as chronic pain or not but I thought I'd mention it. I take one 5000IU Vitamin D3 tablet every day in the morning, including a multivitamin (Alpha Men from MyProtein). I also take 0.7g Glycine (from TPW) occasionally before bed.
It does sometimes feel like a pain that requires my wrist cracking to relieve the pain.
Is there anything I'm missing? Should I buy a wrist wrap to support my wrist in the gym?
Im beginning to get used to the constant pain in the gym, not sure if it's my manipulation of the wrist (pulling the wrist inward) but this isn't normal.
Thanks in advance.

I am having mild flare ups and reduc 1/2 pred every 4 to 6 week which seems to work for me . Wondering when I see my doctor if I should ask to wait until I am of prednisalone before treatment is given ? Incase that is the cause . My reading were always around 130/ 80 before PMR
Under lot of stress at moment .Waiting for Chk on husbands myaloma as he is in a lot of pain and have house on market trying to move because he had always wanted to .

"Hi folks, Mark here.  This looks like the right place for me.  I was diagnosed with PMR earlier this year. I can't recall exactly when because although the pay started in early December of last year, it took some months before I was referred to a Rheumatologist (I had to wait several months for my appointment).
I was put on 20mg of pred and started feeling better, but then I started feeling terrible...mostly fatigue.  Time went by and several doctors and tests later and it seemed I was having a raging attack of Epstein Barr....Mono.  That meant I had to wean off of pred entirely to let my immune system bounce back and put mono in remission.  8 weeks and an unholy hellish amount of pain later and I've just restarted at 10mgs pred.
I also have a sugar issue, but it seems I may have that under control.  One story I'd like to come across here is someone saying:  ""well, I'm off prednisone completely and I feel fine, I'm in remission.  Everything I've read says it happens in 6 months to a year, or 1 to 3 years or some variation of that, but I've never come across any stats, and doubt its been studied much.  Anyway...Howdy!

"I've been lurking, not commenting for a while but I have a question for you.  In May 2014 I had a bad bout of diverticulis which was treated with Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole.  I had a CT scan which showed no abscess but did show the inflamed diverticula.  In October of that year I had another attack which was much less severe.  At the end of November, 2014, I developed PMR which I have been treating, under the care of a Rheumatologist, since then.  I have never gotten below 5 mg of prednisone.  I am also taking Leflunomide (Arava.)  Before that I tried four months of Methotrexate which did nothing but make me sick.  I have also had intermittent bouts of diverticulitis--sometimes treated and sometime self-resolving.  Has anyone else had similar problems?  I know the doc checked me for inflammatory bowl disease as part of my general work-up and that was essentially negative.  Curiosity reigns.  I am getting sick of being sick.

In May he diagnosed me with PMR, gave me a steroid injection and prescribed 5mg prednisone daily. Was doing well on this and it was taking care of the pain. Was back to see him 2wks ago and told him about headaches I've been having on right side in head. He checked for tenderness and asked about jaw cramping. He was going on 2 wks holidays that day but was sending me to get ESR & CRP blood tests done and said he'd look at then as soon as he got back. In the meantime the temple pain had been getting worse and more local, my tongue gott painful one day and horrible taste but eased of the following day, various other symptoms during the couple of weeks. Then yesterday night woke 3 times with pain in both temples and radiating across my forehead, back of head and up to crown, stayed most of yesterday plus felt really ill and generally awful, eventually went away almost completely but back again this morning on both sides, more local to both temples. Got blood results on Wednesday. My ESR was 24 down from 27 in May and my CRP was 7, and had been 7 in May. My doctor didn't want to make a call on Gca and said wait to see what Rhum doc said when he got back from holidays which is tomorrow. My question is this....should I go to see a doctor today, it wouldnt be my own doctor, or wait till tomorrow to see/talk my rhum doctor? I have to say I am worried sick. Thanks for any advice!

I was diagnosed in March of 2014 and in reviewing my pretty precise notes I see that I have basically yo-yoed my way thru the last 2+ years, combatting the odd-ball reactions, i.e., rash, etc and flares. My most recent dose was 7-1/2m for 12 weeks...wherein I ""managed"", but, in hindsight was in more pain than I should have been...unless I just sat on the couch all day. I have stopped the flare with 9m the last 3 weeks and feel as good as I did on the initial first dose. My rheumatologist will not be happy. I am thinking that the 10m for one year might be the magic bullet that helps contain the inflammation and speeds recovery...??

"I asked a question a week or so ago about digestive problems and steroids/ PMR but I guess I' alone on that one. Anyway, I have new question . I tapered off of prednisone a little over a month ago, in addition to all the digestive problems I have pain in both shoulders again and pain in the lower back radiating to thighs, it feels rather muscular. I spent most part of the day in the ER yesterday. They did a CT scan of the lower back and tell me they see a lot of arthritis. In addition to all this wonderful stuff, I am severely depressed and having panic attacks! This is Hell. I see my PCP today, Endocrinologist on Tuesday and Rheumatologist at the end of the month! I'm sick of doctors. Can someone give me more insight to Bowen Therapy?

"July 2014 diagnosed with PMR.  Like most, I was blindsided by this autoimmune disease.  I am allergic to Prednisone and have been taking another steroid, Medrol.  I am down to 2 mg but can't seem to get below that.  I have tried reducing to 1 3/4 a day (yes, I patiently cut the tiny pills) but that 1/4 mg less flares up my PMR.  Yesterday had terrible pain in my right shoulder blade and aching leges.  Went back up to the 2 mg and, so far I'm doing okay.  (I tried reducing to 1 3/4 a few times but each time, I have to increase to the 2 mg).  It is so frustrating because I cannot seem to lose the weight I have put on since I started taking steroids.  Called Rheumatologist and she advised me to stay on the 2 mg until our next visit which is October 3rd.  I want to get off these steroids as I fear it is starting to affect my bone density.  I'm thinking of trying the reduction schedule suggested earlier in this post; New dose, old dose 4 days, etc.)  Has anyone else tried this?

"Hi everyone, Well after getting down to 10 mil of pred and staying for about a week the pain in my left groin and thigh was so bad and I felt the neck and shoulder stiffness beginning to come back that I had to call my Rheumy today.
He told me to go back to where I felt it was tolerable which was at 12.5 so I did and hoping it helps because I was afraid I would get as bad as when first diagnosed. I was totally pain free at 20 mil. back in Feb.
Ive only been the pred since Feb of this year and thinking maybe my Dr started the taper to soon.
My question is if anyone takes their full dose all at once since I take 10 in am and rest in pm and it has been working. I was told that its best this way since the pred wear soff after a certain amount of hours but not sure if this is accurate.
Thank you,
Sharon

"Can back pain be caused by or exercerbated by PMR? I have had all the usual shoulder and hip/leg pain (and hands and knees!) and I had tapered down to 8mg in 18 months. To try and combat the pain and siffness in my hands and one shoulder I have gone up to 11mg (taking 2 at night and 9 in the early morning). However, for a couple of months now I have been suffering from back pain as well. I have recently had an MRI and was told that the problem is inflamation between L4 and L5. The MRI doctor told me that the prednisone probalby masks some of the back symptoms I am getting but on the other hand the PMR probably makes the inflamation worse. My understanding of PMR is that the pain is usually muscular (although in my case this would not apply to my knees and hands) and would not apply to my back, so I'm interested if anyone else has views or experience of this.I had to have cortisone injections in both of my shoulders becasue the predinose was not dealing with it and am wondering if I should consider a cortisone injection into my back.

"Hi everyone, sorry this post may be long but have been away for a while and now need some advice. Diagnosed with PMR & possible GCA in Feb of this year and started only on 15 mil of pred and was a new person, no more headaches no more pain. Two months ago Rheumatologist began a slow taper by 2&1/2 mil for a month, then another 2&1/2 a month later. Im now at 10 mil once at 5am and after two days of the taper pain is beginning to reurn in my upper thighs, groin and neck. I also have a tremendous headache. My appt is on Sept 15th, he has me tapering on my own every month but now Im unsure if I should restart the other 2&1/2 mil that I was taking at 6pm with the first taper or go back to the original 5 mil at 6pm which had me at 100% pain free.
I wasnt to bad at the 12% either but Im confused at what some are saying here, one day at one dose and then a few days stay at another so Id appreciate any info on this tapering method.
 Taking just the 10 mil in am is not working for me.
Thank you all!

"As I understand, the body normally produces approximately the equivalent of 7 mg of prednisone daily.  Also, taking prednisone suppresses the body's production where the adrenals quit producing any.  If someone is taking around 7 mg of prednisone shouldn't there be relatively few side effects since it is really just the same as what a healthy person would have circulating in their systems?

"Hello, new to this group. Have experience to share and would appreciate feedback on my situation. I was diagnosed with PMR over a year ago and put on 20 mg prednisone, which my MD said was a ""low dose"" which I could take for a year. Have learned this was not good advise. The pain subsided but never completely went away. I tried tapering off 2.5 mg at a time, and when I got to 12.5, the full pain came roaring back. My new MD put me on 40 mg to ""blow it out."" Pain left. One morning I woke up with debilitating stomach pain and low fever. It went away after about 4 hours. The next morning I had mild pain and while poking around discovered a hernia. Went to the emergency room to have it checked, they did a CT scan and found diverticulitis ( a hole in my colon) which was allowing bacteria into my abdominal cavity (peritonitis). They said it had nothing to do with the hernia - just a lucky coincidence, because had I not come in, I would have been dead within 48 hours. Everyone was totally amazed that I had walked in under my own power with minimal pain. Apparently the prednisone had masked the symptoms. Surgery involved removing 8"" of colon and putting me on a colostomy bag for 3-4 months.  In the hospital, they brought me down from 40 mg prednisone with an IV version so I left with the equivalent of 20 mg oral. Started tapering off and again extreme pain came back about 12.5 mg. Went back to 17.5 which brought the pain to a bearable level and am now trying to go down 1 mg per week. Have a (first) rheumatologist appointment in 3 weeks. My MD is sympathetic but out of her depth. Glad to have found this site. Thank you.

"Hi All,
My history is that I was diagnosed with PMR in April of this year after suffering for about a year prior. Placed on 15 mg prednisone and obtained a dramatic improvement. Have since reduced to 11mg where I am relatively comfortable. Started the Dead Slow method to try to reduce to 10mg and had no problem until I got to 1day 10mg  2days 11mg. (I was OK with 1day 10mg and 3 days 11mg). This has happened to me on two occasions so I am sticking with 1day 10 and 3 days 11 for a few weeks. I'm thinking the next time I should try to go from 1day 10.5 and 2 days 11.

"I've been taking Prolia (denosumab) for three years with no side effects until my last injection which resulted in horrendous thigh cramps eight hours after the injection. Before my next six monthly injection my doctor suggested I bought forward my dexa scan.  
My results are encouraging:  BMD in the spine has increased 12.7% since previous scan in 2013 (T score now -4.1)  BMD in the hip has increased 5.7% (T score now -1.9). Left femoral neck 0.475 g/cm2 (forget to check how his relates to T score).   
The dilemma I have is:  Do I stick with denosumab, despite a very painful (albeit relatively short lived) reaction, knowing that it improves my bone density? , do I look at alternative treatments?? or do I risk going down the no drugs,  natural course, not knowing if my bone density will continue to improve? 
I visit the gym two or three times a week, strength and weight bearing exercises, walk a lot and go to weekly yoga classes.
I take calcium with boron and magnesium, vitamin K2 and vitamin D3

"Hey guys, I'm a 21 year old who's not very active physically. I've had muscle twitches on occassion like most people do over the years. However, the last couple of weeks I've been experiencing them in my arms, legs, stomach, back, neck, and face. Coincidentally, I have been enduring a great deal of health anxiety over what is believed to be acid reflux. My diet is terrible to be quite honest. I've done some reading online (which probably hasn't helped the anxiety) and have found that the cause can be anything from dehydration-ALS. Now of course I am worried about the worst case scenario. My father was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, so naturally, i fear that it is something more serious than the common causes of stress, anxiety, lack of vitamin intake, and dehydration. I brought it up to my PCP while doing a check up for the acid reflux. He checked the reflexes of both my arms by having me relax and he bent my arm back and forth. I asked if it was possibly due to the medication I was prescribed (ranitidine 150 mg) and he said he wasn't sure. The twitches don't last very long. Usually just a few contractions and then they stop only to come back anywhere from a few minutes to a coupe of hourIs later. I have an app in October with my PCP for a physical. In the meantime, I started on a magnesium supplement yesterday and am trying to drink more water (probably ctually only drink 2-3 bottles of water a day and some sort of caffinated drink during the day) Anyways, if anyone could add some input that would be awesome. I'm in desperte need of reassurance that I'm not dying.

"What I have recently learned may be useful to some PMR victims who experience shortness of breath on exertion.
I am an almost 82 yr male who has maintained a high fitness level until PMR - diagnosed last August but almost certainly affected as early as the previous August. A typical beginning medrol dosage of 16mg/day brought immediate miraculous relief. My aerobic capability returned completely.
As I began to reduce dosage, I noticed in retrospect a reduction in aerobic ""fitness"" as some stiffness of my back also increased. Because the stiffness increased but was still tolerable I paid inadequate attention to the aerobic change. As I reduced dosage further (last low dosage was 3.5mg/day) there was drastic shortness of breath with little exertion. It was not acceptable.
I did considerable online research and found a small number of medical papers noting an association of interstitial lung disorder with PMR. I increased my medrol to 12mg/day and noticed a change in aerobic capability almost as dramatic as the initial (miraculous) relief of PMR on first starting medrol.
Had I not increased medrol I am firmly convinced that my lungs would have suffered irreversible damage.
I believe that anyone suffering from PMR should pay close attention to aerobic capability as they try to wean from medrol. While lower doses of medrol may lower the risks associated corticosteroids they may endanger the lungs. For those noticing aerobic insufficiency I suggest serious consultation with their physicians. But it may be necessary to make your own decisions. In my case two rheumatologists told me there was no relation of shortness of breath to PMR or medrol.
PS, I walked today at a rate of 12min40sec to the mile with no distress whatsoever. And I have been down to 10.5mg/day for 10 days.

"I've been taking LDN (low dose naltroxone) for almost two months now and it has been helping a great deal, so I'm just putting this out there in case anyone has considered it, with the caveat that anyone thinking about it does the reading and research first.   
It's not mainstream and maybe the verdict is out on long-term side effects, which seem to be mild, if any, at this juncture, and how/if it interacts with other meds, and it also doesn't seem to work for everyone but it worked for me.  I'd say I'm about 80% back to where I was pre-PMR.  I have had no side effects, other than interesting dreams.
Because we're all different in how PMR has affected us and some have other conditions in addition to PMR, my situation is that aside from some osteoperosis that has shown up, I'm very healthy and I no longer take prednisone, so LDN is the only medication I take.
I don't want to give anyone false hope, because we're all unique in our journey with PMR and our health conditions in general, but I feel that I've begun to get my life back and I'd like to think that others will have that same experience.   But, again, do the research.

"I was diagnosed with ostearthritis in the hip 3 years ago - but because I developed PMR around that time I have never experienced any pain from the hip due to it being masked by the steroids. However, 2 weeks ago my Prednisolone strength was reduced to 10mg daily from 15mg. I am now experiencing terrible pain in my hip and leg ( due to the arthritis which I was totally free from before.) I am sorely tempted to up the dose!. I am due to see my doctor next week about this. Cannot take any other anti inflammatory drug whilkst on the steroids. Would be interested to know if anyone alse has had this trouble?

"So, 2-1/2+ years into PMR...numerous attempts to taper down to 7m recently, from 7-1/2m. Eileen recently suggested that maybe it sounded like 8m was where I should be, bass in the information I posted. Well, I finally admitted to the flare 4-5 days ago and upped my dose to 8m and found some relief. Today was a stressful day with my daughter (major eye issues), so I decided t take 9m.
it is evening and I am pain free! I have had major foot, leg pain and other niggles for the past year...mostly at 7-1/2m. Does this mean I really should be at 9m and pain free?....or should I taper directly back to 7-1/2m and tolerate the bearable pain? I feel so much better!

Is is that unusual or do most of you have these as well?

"I was diagnosed with PMR Dec 2014 and am in second round of course of Prednisone after symptoms returned upon completion of first.  Presently on DSNS method transitioning to 3 mg. and am feeling well over all. About 6 weeks ago developed an intermittent ache in last two upper molars but only upon biting down.  Both have old root canals.  My dentist, who I have made aware of my long term Prednisone use, took XRays and examined my mouth and can find nothing wrong.  His opinion is that my sinus cavity dips low near the roots and perhaps my sinuses are causing the pain.
it comes then goes away for a few days, then returns.   I am beginning to wonder if perhaps there is an upper jaw problem, caused by Prednisone, that may have not been apparent on the XRay.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?

"I'm 62 years old and newly diagnosed with PMR. It was tough to hear that it wasn't something that could be fixed by a swift course of antibiotics and I think I was in denial for the first few days. But after researching and looking into alternatives to prednisone, I've come around. Armed with more knowledge, this morning I took my first dose of 15mgs. The doc had originally prescribed 20mg and we settled on 15mgs after discussion. I plan to up it to 20mg right away if the aches don't cease and I'll let you know how I get on.
On my learning curve, I have found this forum immensely helpful. Thank you all so much for sharing your experiences and good advice. From you, I've learnt to think of this as a chronic condition that could go into remission in two or three years if I'm lucky. I've learnt to be vigilant for temporal artemis and GCA. I've learnt reducing the prednisone will need to be done very, very gradually. I've learnt I'm going to need to take steps to combat the negative side effects of prednisone so I have some lifestyle changes to make. And very importantly, I've learnt I'm not alone.  
I'm a writer and video maker by trade. I've never been very physically active but I've always been busy and worked hard and the impact this might have on my work is a big concern for me. The last couple of months of aches and fatigue have been very difficult.
But I'm starting today with a positive frame of mind and it's largely down to this forum. I've found the stories you've been willing to share so helpful and if I can get my energy levels up, I plan to vlog about my experiences with PMR. I'd just like to pay forward in case my story can help someone else, as you've all helped me. Thank you so much.

"Just as things were getting better, getting off the MTX and planning a few days away in a nice hotel, I end up in hospital with pneumonia! Is there no end to the tripwires someone has put in my path!
Mrs O and Flip Dover already know of this, as we've been in touch outside the forum.
It hit me without warning. I'd had a very busy week with a couple of hospital appointments, art class and family get together the weekend before, but I went to bed Thursday evening feeling fine. Woke in the night feeling ill. My GP came the next afternoon and called the ambulance. By then I was feverish, very low blood pressure etc, but no symptoms of a chest infection.
I was admitted to hospital with a CRP of about 130, temperature of 40°, high lactate score etc etc.
I spent a week there while they brought the infection under control. Of course, my immune system being so compromised, my body needed all the help it could get to fight the infection.
I came home Friday evening (today being Monday) and have only been out of bed to go to the bathroom so far. I have another week on a double dose of antibiotics.
I've no idea whether this had been simmering in my body or whether it just happened within a few hours.
On a slightly different matter, a nodule was discovered on my lung a while ago when I had a PET scan. My Rheumy told me it was nothing to worry about, but when I questioned it again at my last visit, she said she would talk to her colleagues about it. In today's post, I've received an appointment for a detailed scan mid September.
I don't think it picked up on the x rays I had in hospital.
So, I'm lounging in bed at the moment, sleeping a lot and getting plenty of reading in!

"hi all,
 I woke up Wednesday from a short nap with sever shoulder pain in both shoulders.  Couldn't imagine what from.  I had been having slight frontal headaches all week but thought maybe this was allergy related, I never get headaches.  I decided to go to my local Er and the dr. Only gave me a test for possible tick Bourne illness but he said it seems I may have PMR and did give me pain med and a shot of torodol.  Not feeling that this was enough I went to MGH yesterday and got chemistries done.  Very high inflammatory markers which I never have.  The scariest part is that I seem to have all the symptoms for PMr, but I also have so many other health issues and I'm a only 62!  One of these issues is an eye problem which I cannot ever take steroids for or the problem can also cause blindness,  I am between a rock and a hard place.  Possibly need steroids for PMR and to,prevent temporal iritis but am. Im not supposed to take them due to central serous retinopathy, the other eye problem.  
I haven't yet been diagnosed with PMR and may be getting ahead of myself, but I really think I do.  I have appt. with pcp this week and my opthmologist.  
I am am very scared of going blind!  In the meantime I just took pain med. so I have some relief.
thanks everyone for listening.  Anyone else in the same shoes, unable to use steroids?

Am so unhappy and overwelmed with all the medication I have to take.
And now I have been assessed ""well"" and unable to claim ESA after scoring ZERO points in the assssement,
I know this is very common and the usual appeal has to be made.
Has anybody ever been successful?
They also said they did not receive the form I filled-in to claim in the first place!!!!!
I dont know how to gather the strength to bother anymore. My position seems doomed from the get go. 
None of the tests at the assessment were relevent to PMR and I said this but they did not listen.

"Hi everyone, still learning stuff after 18 months of this rollercoaster.....
From the very start I've had really sore spots (mostly in my legs) that I don't really notice until they throb and start hurt, and then I rub them - sometimes they are so painful I could cry - they burn when I touch them. I know, simple solution - don't touch them - but I am almost compelled to rub them - hard! One of those pleasure/pain situations.
They are slightly swollen - I do wonder if it's inflammation build-up.  they are usually in my calves, thighs and inner knees.... but I also have them on my upper arms and elbows. They come and go quite randomly.
Any ideas?  is it part of PMR? Fybromyalgia? Myofacial pain syndrome?

"Hi, I am just reading that a lot of people take their Pred early mornings.. I was never really told or explained on a good time or what time would benifit me better except to take it early morning because it may keep me awake at night. So early morning to me is like 10am.
I am on 40mg a day now. Would it be better to take it like 4am etc, and if so why?  and I usually don't like to drive when I do take it....  so some days if I have a morning appointment, I don't take it until I get back, early afternoon. Will this be messing me up ?, because even on 40mg a day, sometimes I just don't feel it works as well.
I am due to have a breast operation in 2 weeks: And after that I would like this all sorted: I have PMR AND GCA  for about 3 half months now, started on 25mg then went to 40mg because of the GCA.
My Dr wants to start lowering soon.

"I finally saw my rheumy yesterday, following PET scan and temporal biopsy.
The side effects of MTX have been getting steadily worse over several weeks to the point where I was either sleeping or resting. It felt as if my body was giving up. I have also nearly lost my voice, it sounds as if I have a bad throat infection, although I don't, my voice has just gone.
The end result of my consultation was that she told me to come off the MTX as the side effects were just too severe. I'll continue with the folic acid until I see her again in 4 weeks time. I'm so relieved. I really wanted it to work, but it was leaving me unable to function. I will continue my taper of the pred unaided and hope for the best. Currently on 22.5mg for another 2 weeks, then down to 20mg. 20mg and below is where I've had problems in the past, so we'll see. I'm 6 months down the line since I started MTX and that further forward with the GCA, so maybe, if I'm lucky, I'll be able to reduce better.
As for the nodule on my lung, she will discuss with colleagues. She said it could just have been there all the time, but I pointed out that it wasn't there when I had an x-ray before starting the MTX. Funny how I have to point out the obvious!
The biopsy had shown no giant cells, - again not expected, but the surgeon performing the biopsy told me the artery section looked unhealthy and withered. Again, rheumy will investigate further.
So, I'm feeling optimistic, although exhausted, that I will be off the MTX now.

"that inflammation is the by-product of PMR and the whole reason behind taking the drugs! It’s not so much about treating the disease, but reducing the long term effects of inflammation.
That it's the process of trial and elimination in working out what drugs will work for you that’s so horrible, but at least the meds can be stopped at some point if they’re killing you.
When I read the risks (including morbidity) associated with uncontrolled inflammation, it’s pretty a frightening scenario.

"I've been taking pred for 5 months now following PMR diagnosis in March 2016. I am 50. Started on 15mg, went to 40 then 20 then 15 then 12.5 within 4 months and was fine. Dropped to 11mg but was in pain again and went up to 12mg. I am still stiff and sore in hips and shoulders. I have gained half a stone, which is a lot for me as I havalways been petite, and have a big neck and face which brings me down. Just recently I have been low and tearful and wiped out.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in Sept.07 after suffering 8 weeks of agonising pain in shoulders and neck,weight loss of around 1 stone and extreme tiredness. GP prescribed antibiotics, painkillers then laterly anti-depressants!(which I didn't take)Felt a nuisance visiting so often but was desperate to find out what was wrong with me as I have always been fit and healthy and was reduced to a wreck because of the pain.My blood pressure kept going down to the point of blacking out on several occasions and still my GP was unhelpful.I suggeted to him it may be PMR on the advice of a friend who's father had had the condition but was told it doesn't affect people under 50!!(I'm 49) After finally seeing a consultant at the hospital and having blood tests done I was told that due to the high sed rate (135) I most likely had PMR!!!and was put on 20mg prednisalone a day.Within a day I felt much better, and the pain went away which seemed like a miracle!!After three weeks my dose was cut to 15mg and over the last couple of weeks I have had pain in my neck and shoulders though nothing like it was before and felt tired again. I don't know whether it's best to put up with this to stay on a lower dose or to up it again for a while.Someone with more experience of this condition may be able to offer some insight into this. I don't want to take steroids for any longer than neccessary due to the side effects which are worrying to say the least, so would like to get onto as low a dose as possible as soon as I can but I'm terrified of the pain coming back as bad as it was before.Would be glad of advice from fellow sufferers of PMR.

He asked what symptoms bothered me the most. I explained that everyday tasks caused problems. Things like drying my hair, my arms ache and feel heavy. Walking up stairs causes pain in my calves n thighs. That's when he said it didn't sound like PMR.
My question is does anyone else suffer like this?

"Hi all. 3 months ago I was told I had PMR, then 3 weeks after that GCA : I have been on 40mg of pred now for a month for the GCA; Blood test this week. My levels were going up and down, I still get pain on 40mg a day, not as much.
Last week I had my annual mamagram done, called back for a core Biopsy, today I was told I have a early stage of DCIS which is a non invasive cancer. So back to my Dr to arrange a operation, it is treatable with a Lumpectomy, only day surgery. 
My question is, has anyone else had to have surgery when on high dose of Pred, I am on 40mg, will I have to go off it for the surgery? they say I should not leave it longer than having it done within 4 weeks.

"Hello there, I was diagnosed with PMR on 10 June. About a month earlier I couldn't move my neck and went to my osteopath rather than my GP. Rather than improving though, another part of my body would seize up during the following treatments. I was also exhausted. Having googled, I had a good idea what the problem when I finally saw my GP. I began the Prednisolone on 2 July, 15 mgs. My ESR was 44. 
Maybe I should add I'd reluctantly been on Simvastatin for 15 years and stopped it to see whether it could be responsible for the PMR. The jury's out! 
The thing is though since starting the Prednisolone, I feel so much better in every way. I'm doing chores I've been putting off forever and have much more energy. 
Is this fairly normal? I really do think it was coming on for quite a while as I'd seen my GP in March when blood tests proved inconclusive.
I would welcome comments.

"I have been on 11mg for a month or two and doing relatively well. At the beginning of July I decided to try to taper to 10mg using the suggested slow method. Saturday and Sunday ( yesterday and the previous day ) were my last two days of taking one day old and one day new ( 11mg and 10mg ).
Unfortunately, I woke up yesterday with depression, anxiety, loss of interest in things, brain fog and slight increase in pain and stiffness. I felt so ""out of sorts"" that I never got out of bed or got dressed. Today I am feeling the same way and am very disappointed in the position I am in and concerned with what I should do at this point.
I went back to 11mg this morning and was thinking going forward rather than going back to 11mg every day, I should go back to taking 10mg every third or fourth day so as to maintain whatever gains I made during this past month.
I would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.

"I was diagnosed one month ago with PMR after having symptoms and problems for 9 months.  Extreme stiffness in hips/thighs and later it developed in my shoulders and upper arms.  Also had swelling in my hands, wrists, feet and ankles as well as pain in knees and elbows and lower back.  Started prednisone of 20 mg a month ago and will continue with that dosage for 3 months before I start to taper.  However, at appointment yesterday, my specialist is now questioning whether it is PMR or RA.  He said that while the prednisone has dramatically improved my symptoms, he feels I am having some atypical symptoms of PMR - mainly hand and feet swelling as well as other joints not usually involved in PMR.  Because of this and because of my age (50 years old), he is doing further testing for RA to make sure the diagnosis is right. I have previously been tested for RF and it was negative.  He also said that even if it is RA, the prednisone would also have improved symptoms for RA as well.  Never realized how difficult it would be to get a clear diagnosis.  I have been having problems for 10 months now.

"I posted the other day that I have been ill for some time, 2+ years, and the relief GP actually diagnosed PMR just over 2 weeks ago, after 4 days of prednisolone 20 mg I had 80% relief plus of pain and she upped my dose to 30mg and I had my already arranged rheumatology appt this week, he says it isn't PMR as I'm 53 years of age and my ESR is 36  and was quite cross with the situation. On Friday he told me to reduce my dose immediately to 25 mg and see the GP as planned Wednesday.
Since Friday I have got the pains creeping back in across the shoulders the skin burning sensation I used to have, can anyone relate to this situation please.
I was elated in a way that the GP had helped my pain as I find working with it soooo difficult 12 hour shifts with no breaks most of the time 2  a week, even pacing myself if possible through them flattens me for days at home, that I can't do anything on my time off. Now I feel despondent again as I have pain on this reduction and the GP is leaving in August. 
Has anyone any situations they know of similar, and what should I do?

"Hi,
I was diagnosed with pmr in May and reducing steroids, down to 10 mg.
I have had amazing support and information from many of you, as I am in denial most of the time and still think I can be super woman.
I have however tried very hard to pace what I do, so Sunday, and Monday did very little in the way of tasks, as I wanted to finish floor boards on Tuesday.
Old property gaps in floor boards, so armed with filler I agreed with myself I would only do 6, this took a couple of hours all ok.
This morning felt like I had been hit by a truck, arm, legs, hands hurt, so tearful spent most of the day in bed.
Was it too many boards or to few days resting before hand.
This I know is trivial considering what others on this forum are going through, just feel so sad, I have wasted a beautiful sunny day in and out of bed.
I so hope this gets better.
Hope you are all well.

"I have just been reading ""clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica"" and here too they seem to distinguish between stiffness and pain.  The authors seem to believe PMR people should suffer stiffness, especially morning stiffness,  but not pain, although ""aching"" was OK for PMR.  It is a very interesting article with a long bit on the differential diagnosis of PMR.  
     I do know there is can be a difference between stiffness and pain: my late husband had Parkinson's and was very stiff, but never complained of pain.  But I was thinking about the people on this forum, most of whom do complain of pain, sometimes ""screaming pain"".  What kind of pain?  How is the pain manifest?
       In my case, it got to the point that a simple shoulder massage was unbearably painful.  If  you pressed on the muscles in my arms, it hurt.  For awhile I tried trigger point therapy and that helped:  press on a muscle knot and it will resolve in a couple of minutes and go away.  But after awhile that didn't help and I couldn't find muscle knots to press.
Is this typical or unusual?
      I did suffer the ""gel"" phenomena of getting out of a car after 15 minutes and being unable -or unwilling- to move for a minute or so.  But I don't remember stiffness being worse in the morning.
      So I wonder what experience others have.  Do any of you have stiffness without pain?

"I have been ill for a few years now, sent from pillar to post rheumatology, physio appointments. No one seemed to have joined any dots with my problems.
Dry eyes, mouth, blocked saliva ducts, dry mucous membranes, painful joints, getting worse and worse, fatigue to the extreme.
the doctors said physio and rheumatology, they did X-rays DEXA scan, they said, oh you have osteopenia, and mild poly arthritis, but the symptoms were so severe, it just didn't add up to me. My bloods were ok apart from borderline hypothyroid, on repeat they were normal. Although thyroid antibodies are raised.
My job is 13 hours a day to get up out work and back 2-3 dayside/nights a week, many days I couldn't walk properly, sleep or rest either but kept on going as no one could tell me what was wrong, I thought it was all in my head, a menopausal nutcase really. I tried not to complain, but it was clearly on my face I could see my deterioration, no one ever commented.
recently, on 2 holidays I could barely walk the pain in my whole body was worse than ever, I couldn't move, felt like a block of concrete and my head pounding, no normal paracetamol/ibuprofen worked, no doctors would give me anything else, as they had obviously made their minds up I was a fake, or so I felt.
But in April, May and June I was ill had 2 weeks off work and worked the days I could the rest of it. Went several times to the doctors, oh you have sinusitis, or sore throat or D&V all repeating itself, again and again. Antibiotics not really effective. Bloods this time showed raised ESR and in 5 weeks an appt with the rheumatologist, so again I was left to struggle.
I went to the hospital, bloods repeated and one test for sjrograns syndrome positive, left awaiting my fete, will see them this Friday again.
3 days later I couldn't walk, my head pounding especially when layed down, I went to see a relief GP, who started me on 20mg prednisolone daily, some effect but now on 30mg daily as she wanted a better effect, things have started to settled but my spine still very stiff, and of course feel dreadful on the steroids.
now worried I have GCA as well as my undiagnosed possible PMA went on so long undetected.
sorry for rambling but this is pretty much my history, it helps to write I suppose so thank you for stating with me on this first post.
as I said it's all mew to me.

"I had pain and stiffness in my legs and hips last year and was told by GP it was most likely due to menopause and 'just getting older'. I kept saying I felt like I'd been hit by a truck every morning upon arising. Three months ago I started to get dreadful left hip pain and stiffness, an ultrasound showed tendonitis in top of hip and thigh. I also have tendinitis in my left elbow. Strong pain killers did nothing, couldn't get out of a chair without great pain and started to use an elbow crutch. I insisted my GP trial me on pred and within 48hrs all pain gone!! Was only on it two weeks, had to stop due to terrible mood change teary all the time, mouth ulcers and bad cold sore outbreak. The pain in my hip is 50% less now but I developed left jaw/temple pressure pain for two weeks. This too has eased but it's intermittent and left side of face feels sore. I always have a sore scalp as I wear my hair up in a pigtail( lots of thick curly hair). The GP won't give a diagnosis of PMR until my rheum assessment which is a three month wait to get in. Is it PMR/GCA I'm totally unsure!!

"Hi All, 
I'm on 40mg of Pred a day have been for near 1 month, having blood done next week to see how it all is. PMT AND GCA , starte don 20 but put me up for a month.
My problem at the moment is I take 1 x 25mg tablet plus 3x 5mg tablets to make up the 40mg.
On Saturday I had run out of the 5mg so got more, took them. I woke on Sunday around 4am by strong pain in my knees and legs. Later in the morning I took my Preds again, same thing happen Sunday morning, strong pain, and again Monday and Tuesday. But today has also started in my arm again a little and temple headache sore scalp. My knees and legs had not been a problem before. So I look at my tablets, and found that the knew ones 5mg were different. They said PREDNISOLONE 5MG , each tablet contains PREDNISOLONE 5MG ..... ) NOT PREDNISONE)
My others and the 25mg say : PREDNISONE 25mg and 5mg ....
each tablet contains PREDNISONE 5MG AND 25mg .....
My pain is so bad I am wondering if I am having a flare up? or if it has something to do with the change of tablets as it started then. I hope to see my Dr tomorrow in case these tablets are not working for me with the Pred 25mg ones... I don't normally winge about pain, but the last 3 days I have had chronic pain and done nothing but lay in bed because of it. My mind is clear, not feeling down....
Just a thought about different brands of tablets and Genetic brands.

"Hey everyone!
I went to my rhuematologist on Monday for my 3 monthly appointment. I've been feeling a bit poorly (more than usual that is!) so it was a timely visit. It turns out my CRP is at it's highest level ever, so I feel somewhat justified in feeling like crap!
As background: I'm currently on 5mg Pred, 20mg MTX (followed by folic acid), Lryica, antidepressants and BP medication. I've also been taking a fair bit of Panadine Extra (codiene 15mg and paracetomol 500mg). It is believed I have myofacial pain syndrome, and possibly fybromyalgia as well as PMR).
The rhuemy is concerned I'm not responding to pred like I should be -  other than the first week or two on pred I've never felt 'well' - and the MTX has worked as well as it can on me - I've dropped to 5mg from 20mg last Xmas!) so he's keen to try a new drug regime on me.
He seems to think that Tocilzumab, usually only used to treat RA, might help PMR, however, it is a regulated drug here in Australia, worth roughly $10k a year, so unless I'm diagnosed as having RA I can't get it. I also have to have tried the standard treatment for RA (Plaquenil) for at least 3 months. So as of yesterday I've increased my pred to 7 1/2mg and started on Plaquenil.
Day two and I feel dreadful. I'm teary, disorientated and have a funny tummy (that's putting it mildly!). I'm not allowed in direct sunlight, and have to wear sunglasses when I go outside, as the Plaquenil can damage the eyes. I wonder what else these drugs actually do to us? 
I really don't expect the Plaquenil to actually make me feel better so I wonder why the hell I have to take it???

"Hi all, Ihope everyone is doing better.
My follow up from last mail, I have been on the 40mg of Pred now for 2 weeks, the Dr wanted me to take for 4 weeks, so half way there.
I was told I had PMR about 2 months ago, started on 20 mg Pred then when I got symptoms of GCA they put me on the 40mg a day.
My top half symptoms and hips and pain have eased, also no more temple headaches and sore scap. GCA . so it seems to be working for that.
My problems has been for about 3 weeks severe lower back pain, ( both sides of the gluteus maximus ) I can't stand more than 10 mins, or bend over even my bed. The spasm hit hard and I have to sit or lay down until they ease which is usually within a few minutes, but as soon as I get up within 10 mins they are back. Even standing at the kitchen sink I have to bend forward to ease pain. I have had a xray on my hips, all ok. I have had physio, and last week even had my 1st Bowen Therapy, which helped a little, and am going to try again next week. I do not want to take any strong pain meds for my back with all my other meds.
I can't walk more than 15 mins, and going crazy.
My question is"" ? has anyone else experienced severe lower back pain while with PMR and taking the Pred? I would think if it was part of the PMR that the Pred would help also with that pain.? I also have Ostero Arthritis, but that seems to be under control.
My Physio thinks it's tense muscles, but working on them has not helped me much. 
I am seeing my Dr next week and will ask for further investigation, maybe MRI, SCAN, XRAY whatever they do.  
I would appreciate any feedback to my question.

I've gone and got myself 'addicted' to pain medication. Codeine specifically. Initially I took it to help me sleep at night. Sigh. I have myofacial pain syndrome as well as PMR.
No wonder I'm depressed, eh?  Throw in pred and Lyrica (another pain medication that makes you drowsy) and it's no wonder I'm not motivated to do anything - I'm drugged to the eyeballs all day.
I know I need to tell my Dr, I know I need to get off it, but like all ""drug addicts"" the thought of doing so scares the hell out of me.

"Hi, I know everyone's recovery rate is different with PMR but I am getting totally confused.
I was diagnosed with PMR back in February having the full symptoms in my upper & lower body. I was initially put on 15 mg of pred which worked for my upper body yet I was still experiencing alot of pain and lack of mobility in my lower body. Went back to the Dr's in April and upped my doseage to 20 mg.
I am now decreasing per month by 2.5mg as advised. My mobility is slightly better but still in severe pain. The stiffness doesn't fade until late afternoon, cannot excercise because of pain (catch 22).
I can't understand why my upper body has reacted so well to the meds when my lower body is in such pain. Does the Pred cause part of the pain which is releaved when doseage is reduced. I know I have to be patient and go with the flow now but getting very confused! Anyone able to explain please?
Thanks in advance.

"2-1/2 years int PMR....reduced prednisone down to just almost 7m...been tapering from 7-1/2 for last month using DSNS+ method.
Have had left foot issue for last 1-1/2 years...now left knee s a problem. Slight swelling when I am on my feet too much...suspect regular osteoarthritis...or bilateral capsulitis (googled it), which is common with PMR. Do I need to see my rheumy...or just deal with it as another weird ailment of the disease. Suggestions? Thanks!

"Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with PMR around 6 weeks ago. I am a 67 year old female. Developed pain in my left arm, shoulder and neck which over a period of 2 months spread to the right arm. Did not come on suddenly like a lot of people's symptoms. Blood tests came back abnormal and Doctor put me on 20mg of Prednisolone which helped the symptoms but the pain in my left arm did not go. Doctor then reduced dose to 15mg and I was feeling great for about 10 days. Then the pain in my arm came back with a vengeance and now can hardly lift it. Also feeling really fatigued and shaky with massive hot flushes. Not sure if this is the PMR or side effects from steroids. More blood tests this week and see doctor next week, but the pain is really getting me down.   Wondering if the steroid has been reduced too soon. Would be grateful to hear if anyone else had similar experience. Thank you.

"Fcebook reminded me that I posted this last year.  Thought I'd share with my health-seeking PMR friends and, if the moderator lets me, the osteoporosis crowd as well:
Above all, do not lose your desire to walk: every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it ... but by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill ... Thus if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right.

"Been having reflux for 3-4 months now.  ENT says he sees some reddness, but no signs of tumors or other problems.  I've been on omeprezole 40mg and ranitidine 300mg for this period.  Just saw him last week.  Says he still sees some reddness, but since it isn't acid reflux he didn't see any need to see a Gastroenterologist at this time.  To stay on current meds for another 3 mos.  I am currently on 5 mg of pred since beginning of July.  Started at 20mg April of 2015.  Not doing to badly.  I'm running competively and only have any real aches and pains for a few weeks each month when I taper.  Can pred or PMR cause this reflux.  Have also been doing pretty well on an antiinflammatory diet.  Just cheat on occassion.

"I was wondering if other people get the side effects I feel when lowering prednisone.  I am trying to lower 1 mg per month and am having trouble getting past 9mgs.  On my second day of tapering I get all fuzzy minded, very tired and do not feel like doing anything, this continues on for about 1 week, not improving, then I give up and up the dose to 9mgs again. I thought 1 mg would not make such a difference to my feelings.  The pain in legs and arms seem to be quite mild, not troubling me at all, just this feeling of malaise I cannot seem to shake off.

"I'm a 64 year old female, with no major health issues till Feb of this year when one morning after getting out of bed my legs were very painfull, I put it down to doing a major clean up job on the bathroom two days earlier, thought it was just muscle pain. After about 6 weeks I thought I should see my GP as the pain was getting worse. After a CT scan was told I had a disc bulge, no treatment just pain killers, few weeks later was told I had bursitis in my shoulders as I was having mega pain in both arms, two injections later and no relief. A few weels after, had an ultra sound on my wrist as I was having severe pain, was told I had carpal tunnel, another injection but not much relief. Finally went back to my GP (saw a different one in the practice) he sent me for blood test which confirmed his diagonsis, PMR. 
I am now on 25mg of Presnisone (two weeks now) no pain and am seeing a rheumatologist in a few days time. 
The reason for my post is that I have heard and researched Boron and want to know if anyone has or knows of anyone that uses Boron for PMR. I asked my GP who said he had not heard of using it as an anti-infammatory but would look into for me but not due to see him till some time after seeing the rheumatologist.
I don't want to be on steriods for a long period and. I'm taking tumeric, mega doses of Vitamin D, and C.
I would really love to hear from anyone going throught the same or gone through and what has worked for them.
Thanks for reading my post.

"I am currently on 20mg of Prednisone for about 10 days now after a PMR diagnosis.  In 26 hours, all my stiffness and pain was completely gone which is great.  However, I am noticing that my muscles are weak in my arms.  Having trouble doing things such as hanging laundry on a clothesline and drying my hair.  Before the prednisone I was so stiff and had trouble doing this things, but now the stiffness is gone and it's like my muscles are so tired that I am having difficulty keeping my arms up for any length of time.  Is this common?  Also, should I be doing exercises to strengthen these muscles?  I don't see my specialist for another two weeks and was just wondering if anyone else had the same experience.

"Hi, I am based in Australia (Melbourne).  I am 52 years old & diagnosed with PMR almost 5 months ago.  Unfortunately due to other chronic medical conditions, being on Prednisolone long term is not an option for me (any side effect that can happen, did).  It has affected my diet controlled diabetes to the point of being on medication.  I recently had a nasty chest infection & after 3 course of antibiotics, during which time, my PMR pain was somewhat better, have found that the PMR pain is worse again.  We are currently in winter here & it has been colder of late.  A friend suggested acupuncture but after reading one of the forums, it doesn't seem like there is any substantial evidence to back it up.  Without sounding too whoa's me about it all, I really am getting to the end of my rope, my immune system is shot so this chest infection won't quite go, I've had laryngitis for almost 4 weeks, my skin is weakened & splits easily with heat rash from hot sweats & I've got thrush from the antibiotics.  I am trying to learn as much as I can & looking for any & all advice on things that have worked for other sufferers.  Fatigue & insomnia also play a large part in my ability to cope with day to day.
I know the root cause of raised CRP & ESR is an infection - my rheumatologist has not been able to answer me satisfactorily though... why can't they locate the infection, why can't they treat the infection & what wouldn't antibiotics work for it?
My apologies for the length & also the despondant nature of this thread, I am just looking to find answers & help so would appreciate any advice on alternative therapies, other ways of coping, etc.
Thank you, K

"Hi everyone. I was just doing some research on adrenal glands as I am now down to 4.5mgs per day. I know we have all discussed whether stress can trigger our pmr, so I found this very interesting.
 ""The Stress of Life"" by Dr. H. Seyle:.... ""the adrenal glands are the processors of stress in our bodies. A person's stress resistance will vary with the competence of his adrenals. Continually stressing them, finally depletes them. When we become exhausted by life, on a mental or physical level, our adrenal glands often fail to keep up, and illness ensues.""
I had had a very rough couple of years before developing pmr including skin cancer on my face and a financial crisis. It makes sense that, however well we cope with the stress at the time, something in the body 'has to give' at some point when we reach breaking point! I would be very interested to hear your thoughts x

"So I started taking 20mg of prednisone 6 days ago.  After 36 hours, my stiffness was completely GONE.  I even had some improvmement 4 hours after taking my first dose.  The difference is remarkable.  No problems getting in and our of bathtub, getting in or out of car, walking, dressing, etc., etc.  However in my case some things were not typical, such as my age (50 years old), my stiffness was not worse in the morning, and my ESR and CRP were elevated but not really high. Even though I have dramatic results with the prednisone, I worry that it may be something other than PMR in which prednisone is not totally necessary. I am just not 100% confident in the diagnosis and do not want to take steroids long term if this is the case.  Anyone else feel the same?????

"Hi All,
After about a year of not knowing what all my symptoms were related to I was finally diagnosed with PMR in April, 2016. Started on 15mg prednisone with significant relief of pain and stiffness ( not so much relief of the fatigue ). I was able to taper to 11mg rather quickly partially because I was naive on how to do it and luckily it worked out. I have now been on 11mg for several weeks.
Now that I have learned quite a bit on this wonderful site I started to use the suggested slow taper schedule and I am currently trying to wean to 10mg. I decided to try a full 1mg reduction since it is withing the 10%.
I started with 10mg for one day, 11mg for 6 days, then 10mg for one day 11mg for 5 days etc. I am now down to 10mg for one day and 11 mg for 3 days.  
My dilemma is that each time I take the new lower 10 mg dose the pain in my shoulders and hips returns for the day of and the morning after. It is tolerable and I can deal with it but it does return. My question is should I continue with this weaning schedule in the hope that my body will accommodate and I can get to using 10mg full time or is what I am experiencing a sign that I am not ready to taper from the 11mg ? 
Also, I would appreciate a comment on the fatigue aspect of this. Should my high level of fatigue be alleviated with the prednisone along with the pain and stiffness or is it typically a ""seperate animal"" in being resistant and not resposive to the meds ?
Thanks

However, my rheumy agrees that my bone density is good after 2-1/2 years in prednisone, but he still wants me to take the drug.
i emailed him that I had decided not to do that....not because of the cost...$425 for 3 tablets of Actonel, taken once a month. Medicare will only pay for Aldonate which is taken once a week and is $26 for a 90 day supply. I know people, personally who have had real problems with the bone density drugs, which is not to say that some people have taken it and feel it has worked for them. Reading the pros and cons, I was more persuaded by the cons. I hope this decision will not negatively effect my relationship with my rheumy!

"Hello everyone
I have now been told by two Rheumies that my PMR has 'gone' and that my continuing aches and pains are due to Osteoperosis in my lumbar spine.
I am beginning to believe this as I dont have the stiffness and bilateral pain anymore. So:-
Get off the steroids I've been on them for nearly 4 years and am down to 7.5mg
Physio and painkillers for the spine.
I must say I was a bit  upset. With PMR there is always hope that it will get better. With a crumbly spine, you know you are likely to be in pain for the rest of your life. So I went and bought some pink shoes and  felt much better!
Incidently, more for the Osteoperosis lot than here. Apparently Prolia (Denosunab) is the new miracle drug. I have had one dose with no side effects.
So thank you for your support. I have found this site invaluable, especially Eileen , of course. You are all doing a fantastic job for those of us with this painful disease. I learnt much more here than anywhere else..
I hope I won't be back.
Good luck to you all.

"Hi all, I am so glad that I have found this forum!
So firstly, let me introduce myself.
I am a (young looking) 60 year old woman who up untill recently had been leading a very fit and healthy lifestye.
I had been experiencing the odd niggling aches and pains in my muscles and joints for over 18 months, but did not think too much of it as I just thought it was the 'getting older' process that happens to everyone. But in September of last year the pain and stiffness got alot worse and seemed to attack my entire body with vengeance. The pain became unbearable and very debhilitating. I was sometimes so bad I could hardly move at all, and I felt that I had aged 20 years in a matter of weeks.
I eventually got my diagnosis of PMR early in November, having baffled doctors and physios' throughout the month of October with what on earth could be wrong with me.
Once diagnosed, my doctor imediately proscribed a daily 20mg dose of Prednisolone.
Within 24hrs of my first dose my pain went away completely and I felt on top of the world and more my normal self, I felt better than I had felt for years. This drug was a miracle!
After two weeks of being blissfully pain free and feeling remarkably well, my doctor dropped my dose to 15mg. I was still ok, fit and well apart from a slight niggling stiffness in one of my arms and in my neck on waking in the morning. These pains subsided after about half an hour, so I wasn't too bothered.
I told my doctor this and he said that was fine. I had my life back, and as a bonus I seemed to feel great on the steroids, with no side effects at all.
After two more weeks the doctor dropped my dose to 10mg a day (my present dosage) as it seemed I was doing so well.
However all has not been that good over the Christmas and new year period. Just before Christmas I developed pain and stiffness in my back which lasted for just a couple of days. It then went away so I wasn't that concerned, as I knew even on the steroid treatment I was to expect the odd ache and pain.
But sadly things have deteriated further, as for the past two weeks on getting out of bed n the morning I have the most excruciating pain shooting down one of my legs starting in the knee joint and stretching up to the buttock. The pain is so bad I can't put my weight on my leg at all for at least five to ten minutes. As I slowly and painfully get moving, the pain does subside and eventually it almost goes away completely during the day.
However, in periods of inactivity it comes back again, and the whole procedure starts up again, especially in the evenings.
It seems I have to be active and on my feet at all times to keep this pain away, which is not a bad thing I know. But this of course is not always possible.
I have not upped my Prednisolone doseage again so far, as I am waiting for my next doctors appointment to see what he suggests. I am now wondering if the pain is not actually PMR, and could be a side affect of the Prednisolone, as the type of pain I have is slightly different to what I was experiencing before.
Question is, should I wait for my doctors advice, or should I up my dose right now myself?
The pain is really excrutiating and hard to take, even for five to ten minutes. But I don't really want to mess with my doses.
Comments fellow PMR sufferers would be appreciated.

"I am interested in hearing from others about PMR traveling into the hands and wrists.  Mine migrated from my thighs to my shoulders and now into my hands.  Mostly my right hand.  My doctor concluded that instead of PMR i might have late onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA).  Numerous tests within nuclear medicine (I now glow at night) seemed to prove otherwise even though PMR is not ""known"" to affect the hands.
So...I'd be intersted in hearing from others about whether your experiencing swelling in your hands.  One hand?  Both? And someone out there commented on calcium as being a culprit...meaning too much calcium being consumed to offset bone density issues.  Any thoughts?
Much appreciated.

"Hi, I was diognosed with PMR and now possible GCA. My Doctor started me on 25mg a day Prednisone. Then after 2weeks to 30, then another 3 weeks to 35mg a day. I was having blood tests every 2 weeks, which were going up, then down etc. She now wants me to go straight onto 40mg a day for 1 month and then take blood. 
I am having some eye problems with headaches and sore scalp.
I know when coming off the Prednisone you have to do it very slow, but has anyone gone up to a higher dose as fast as this?, and if so what advice would you give me.
It's been 2 days now on the 40mg, 1st day was ok, 2nd day within hours my face was so puffed and I had fluid in my feet bad, and the worst pains all over. Felt very unwell. I know this will pass after  a few days, but my worry is am I going up to fast. I also know that if I do have GCA that it has to be controlled fast, eyes etc are more important than pain at this stage.

"I have gained 20 lbs since being on Prednisone. I was watching what I ate closely at first trying to keep it from happening. Then it just seemed to come on me. . Since at the time I had no real idea about the duration of PMR and being on steroids I thought in a few months when it's over and I'm off Pred I'll get the weight back off. Well now that I know that I could be on these steroids for quite some time I'm wondering if it's actually possible to get the weight off even though I'm still on the Pred. Has anyone had success at this. I'm at 20 mg currently and know it will be a long process to reduce since I've already attempted 3 x and had to go back up even higher than my initial dose.  I've read Pred actually changes your metabolism.  The PMR battle can be discouraging and then to gain the weight too makes it more so. Any comments and thoughts are appreciated from my fellow PMR cohorts!!!

I am now worried that I am not taking anything to protect my stomach from the effects of Prednisolone.  Does anyone know how protect your stomach naturally from Prednisolone without taking a PPI?  I have been prescribed Ranitidine but too scared to take it after the effects of Omeprazole.  Also, does anyone know how long it takes for Omeprazole to leave your system?

"Hi everyone
I have had PMR for 2/12 years and have successfully reduced to 
5mgms I have no pain or discomfort but I have such poor balance
so much so that I have resorted to using a cane. I don't know what to do. Should I increase  or decrease the dose of prednisilone?
I walk for up to 2hours a day in 3 stages so don't overdo it.
Otherwise l am well but my poor balance is really frustrating.
I would be grateful for any advice.

"I was just diagnosed with PMR after 9 months of stiffness and pain. PMR was my second diagnosis. Initially I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. My problems started 9 months ago when I started having pain and swelling in my hands. At the same time I noticed that my upper left were stiff and heavy if I walked or stood on them for a long time. Found out I had carpal tunnel syndrome and had surgery. In March I developed gaalstones which eventually led to pancreatitis. After 12 gallbladder attacks, I finally had my gallbladder removed. Stiffness in legs has been getting worse and now areas affected are legs, hips, shoulders, hands, wrists, knees, ankles. I have some pain but mostly problems with stiffness. Having trouble getting in and out of bathtub, trouble getting up from chair, trouble opening cans and jars, trouble getting in and out of car, loss of range of motion in my shoulder, etc. Etc. Etc. I 50 years old and my ESR is slightly elevated at 28. Starting prednisone tomorrow. Any one have similar experience?

"Hello everyone
My health has been poor for the last two or three years.  Had Breast Cancer and Thyroid Cancer 5 years ago.  Successfully treated but breast cancer meds and fine tuning of thyroid meds took its toll.
For just over two years have had fatigue, pain in upper arms, shoulders, neck, lower back, hips and shins.  Two years ago, they gave me anti depressants and said the pain was down to depression (NO -  I was getting depressed because of pain and fatigue - but doctors don't understand about chickens and eggs.)   No improvement.  Frequent headaches which I felt were linked to pain.  ie   the worse the headache the more intense the pain - everywhere.  I kept trying to describe it as like having migraine pain all over but just got puzzled looks and more ADs.
 In March, fatigue got worse - falling asleep in supermarket queues and other amazing feats.  Also started to lose weight as appetite lessened.  Not too upset as needed to drop some pounds as AD's have piled on the weight (combined with lack of activity).  Have lost 14 lbs since then and same health probs continued.
In May had an awful virus which lasted two weeks.  GP did alot of bloods etc - again.  Have a vampire type relationship with the nurse in our surgery.  All ok except ESR was 60.  Things got worse and worse after that.  Pain excruciating in all same places and daily headaches since then.  GP thinks fibro and cfs and has referred me to a consultant who knows about these things.  Appt a week on Tuesday.  I suggested PMR and he did ESR and CRP again and they were 'normal' (CRP 4 and ESR 25).  He more or less ruled out that as inflammatory markers not high.  He also said PMR gets better as day progresses.  Still on the fibro / cfs route.
In the meantime, oncologists had a panic that caner may have recurred and did an MRI of spine, CT of head (nothing there - I have a so-funny husband), and CT.   All clear.  No nasties but no answers either.
I have an osteoarthritic knee and await an op for that.  Had a HC injection last summer and to my surprise felt so much better pain wise.  
I have been so ill since having this virus.  Today is a 'good day' - first for months with no headache (Yippee) but I know that if I do much I will pay tomorrow.  This makes me question my suspicion of PMR.  Does that have 'good days' or is every day hell.
Intend to put my case to do I see next week but any advice you can give me will be gratefully received.

"I have been reading Kate Gilbert’s book “PMR and GCA: a survival guide. As many of you who have read it and discussed on the forum before, this is a really excellent help for those of us who just started or who have been long suffering with these diseases.
One thing that I noted was that throughout the book she refers to our ‘famous’ corticosteroid as ‘Prednisolone’ – there was not one mention of Prednisone. I initially thought that this was a typo but apparently not.
I checked into it and read that the difference between prednisone and prednisolone is that one is the precursor to the other. Prednisone is activated by enzymes in the liver to turn into prednisolone. Apparently they do have similar uses but prednisolone is more readily absorbed by the body and is used when there is liver toxicity or liver failure involved.
This indeed surprised me as my rheumatologist has never mentioned or prescribed anything other than Prednisone.
It seems from researching the two names that they have many similarities, but there are differences. The chemical structure and molecular weight are different and prednisone is administered only orally, whereas prednisolone can be given orally, topically or injected.
Anyway, this has surprised me and I am now wondering if there is any information that all my “friends” on this forum can share with those of us who have not heard of this before.
And many thanks to you all for your constant helping and sharing with all of us who are ‘laden’ with PMR.

"I was diagnoesd with PMR after I became ill on a cruise in April.  My pointers for inflamation were high and I was put on 20mg Prednislone.  The pains almost went away but I had such a bed reaction to the steroids that my GP put me down to 15mg after a week.  Most people told me it was too much of a drop and i went back to 20 to no avail.  Before the Pred I had intense pain but nothing else. With the Pred i still have some pain which is not as severe but my hands are useles, I keep dropping things...they are tingly and numb,  I am so breathles it is frightening...I have had a chest xray which was clear.  I am having an ECG to make sure my heart is working OK I had a sore mouth a few years ago and gastritis which were both auto immune.  The sore mouth is back and the gastritis has returned with a vengeance I feel as if I have the flu and have a constant tension headache.  I cannot sleep and am so exhausted I feel it difficult to cope. My GP has arranged a head scan and a visit to a neurologist
I saw a rheumatologist privately on Monday. he says I need more tests to rull out other conditions but did listen to me when I asked if it was possible it was the steroids causing these problems. He suggested a steroid injection and me coming off the pills... Has anyone had this injection and how does it compare to the pills?

"I know that there is a lot of discussion on tapering prednisone, and that's where my problem lies.  I've been on prednisone since Nov 2012 when I had c-diff.  I was put on 20mg of prd until Jan 2013 when I lost the hearing in my right ear.  Went to an ENT and he prescribed 80mg of prd for 3 weeks.  Then just stopped as the ENT doc didn't tell me to taper my dose.  In Feb 2013 I had a recurrence of c-diff and put back on prd.  To my chigrin I had another c-diff occurrence in March and April 2013.  May 15 2013 I woke up and couldn't get out of bed let alone walk as everything hurt.  Went to ER and no one could explain my symptoms, but was kept on 20mg of prd.  I went to my PCP and he prescribed all kinds of pain pills and patches, not what I wanted to take.  However, because of so much pain I reluctantly took them.  Found a new doctor in July 2013 and he got me in to see a Rheumatologist at the University of Michigan where the doctor diagnosed me as having Polymyalgia Rheumatica and raised the dose of prd to 40mg with tapering after two weeks.  As soon as I started the tapering all my issues flared up.  Went to see her again two weeks later and she started me on Humira which started to work, however to make a long story short I landed in the hospital 11 times in 18 months where it was decided to take me off Humira and start on Methotrexate and Folic Acid with a tapering of the prednisone.  It is now 2016 and I can't seem to get past 10mg of prd before I have all types of flare ups.  The odd part of this is that no one really knows whats wrong with me as I've been diagnosed with PR, Reactive Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis and still trying to reduce my PRD and can't get past 10mg before I start having all kinds of problems.  I still am on Methotrexate 20mg and Actinol once a week and folic acid 1 x a day.  This is so frustrating as I want to get off of PRD because it has affected my weight upwards as I'm always hungry.  The doctor just says to me would you rather be heavier or in pain.  Stupid question.  I'm now wondering if I have fibromyalgia as when I get these flare ups it's not just my joints that hurt but all my muscles, my entire body hurts and it is very difficult to do anything.

"Hi all,
This may be a bit of a silly question but have any of you been skiing with PMR?
I'm hoping to go next March as part of my 50th birthday celebrations and have just been thinking about trying to lose some of the weight that the Pred has helped me to put on along with trying to improve my fitness a bit.
However, I'm starting to wonder if I'm mad to even think about skiing.
I'm currently down to 10mg of Pred but struggling to get lower (just about to start trying the dead slow method) - I'd like to think I'd be down around 5mg by March (but know that I could still be on 10mg or even higher).
My PMR mainly affects my shoulders so I think I'd be ok skiing - at the end of the day I'm happy to put up with some pain to get back on the snow. 
I just don't want to find that I end up unable to ski after 1 or 2 days (I also don't think my wife would be too happy if she had to ski on her own).
So, any thoughts?  Am I totally loopy to even consider it or should I get myself booked?

"I posted this in another thread but don't want to hijack that thread so I'm starting a new discussion.
I find that much of my leg and hip ""pain"" is under control while on 11mg of Prednisone but I have another issue. When walking I find that my legs, glutes and hip girdle feel very weak as if they are going to ""seize up"" and stop functioning. I find myself having to walk rather slowly since I am just not able to move them quickly......not because of pain, but because they are just not functioning properly.......I imagine it feels similar to someone who had just run 20 miles.
Same goes for my shoulders. If I'm lying flat in bed holding up a book to read, I find that I can't hold my arms raised for too long before my arms and shoulderd tire to the point of having to lower them.

"It is widely accepted that exercise is beneficial - for infants in 'baby gyms' to very elferly people in care homes, for healthy people, and for those with various medical problems. 
But could Osteoporosis (OP) be a problematic condition here?  Yes, we all hear of the value of 'weight -bearing' exercise, but could it also be risky for some of us?
As you all know, I have 'severe OP' in my back but no fractures (that I know of)  so far. Up until  fairly recently, the only exercise I undertook was brisk walking which I was happy was quite safe. But for some months now I have also been persuaded that some 'back strangthening' floor exercises should also be included. Quite simply I'm really scared that in doing these quite tough exercises I will cause a fracture. If then I experience any discomfort after doing these exercise  (and I have) I worry that on my next scan I'll be told about a couple of 'fragility fractures' (ie. no pain) which may set me on a downward spiral . . and therefore the exercising would have been damaging instead of 'strengthening' . . .  
In a nutshel, I'm wondering if I'd be safer just walking or stair- climbing with no other 'challenging' exercise? I'd certainly FEEL safer.  
Am I alone, and weird, in thinking like this??  Any views?

"I was diagnosed with PMR just a couple of months ago.  I have been on 20 mg of prednisone and 15 mg of methotrexate once per week and the following day leucovorin (folic acid)  I have not been pain free at all until today.  I had been taking the prednisone with breakfast.  Every morning I havef been in terrible pain in my shoulders and my writst.  Yesterday I needed both hands to get my coffee mug to my mouth.  I decide enoug is enough.  So at dinner I went ahead and too a 10 mg tab.  I woke up this monring with absolutely no pain!!!!  I took 10 mg at breakfast and plan to take theother 10 at dinner.  I realize that I dosed myself with 30 mg yesterday.  It is now nearly 2:30 in the afternoon and I am still pain free.  I have accomplished more today than I have in the past several weeks including a very long walk.  Am I delusional due to the fact that I had 30 mg yesterday, or is this new plan apt to work????  When I begin reducing, based upon what many of you have written, I will take the lower dose with dinner.  I am in the U.S. and most doctors here want you to go down by 5 mg at a time.  Since I have not been on the meds for more than two months, maybe that will work for me.  Any suggestions???  I do not see my rheumatologist until the 7th of August.  He wanted me to start reducing before then.  I will have enough meds to stay on the 20 mg until then.  I am thining that if this new routine of dosing twice instead of once, I may start tapering in a week or so.  I know womd of you mentioned middle of the ngiht dosing and such.  I know this will not work for me.  I have restless leg syndrome and would never get back to sleep.  Also I need to take the proton inhibitor within the hour of the prednisone, so my plan for breakfast and dinner seems best for me.  I could take the last dose with some yogurt before going to bed if that would be recommended.  Thanks for any help you can give me.

"Thank you, thank you so much.  I posted last evening of my concern with bleeding and bruising with Methotrexate.  I received so many amazng responses that I felt I needed to comment here instead of several individual responses.  Most of you feel this is the Prednisone.  I am on 20 mg, so do hope that as I go down this will be better.   I have had thin skin for a long time, so have had bruising before, the blood blister and bleeding was more of a concern.  I am going to look for the double gel to put on my arms to help this.  Someone asked about the doses of Methotrexate, the folic acid, and the proton pump inhibitor.  I am taking six X 2.5 mg Methotrexate once a week. On the following day I take 1 5 mg. Leucovorin (folic acid), I take 2 X Famotidine twice daily (this is the proton inhibitor Pepsid).  Someone mentioned the low platelets.  As it turned out my primary care physician ordered a test on this.  I had the test today, so will find that out next Tuesday, the 5th of July when I go to see him.  I will not see my rheumatologist until the 7th of August.  I have had no stomach problems.  I am still very sore in the morning, particularly in my wrists.  Today was especially bad as my blood work had to be fasting, so couldn't take the Prednisone until I was able to havae breakfast.

"I am wondering if anyone has had problems with strange external bleeding and bruising while on Methotrexate.  I have noticed a place on my left arm that has had some blood on it.  I do bump into things from time to time, so didn't think too much about it.  This evening, I wiped my hand over it and it seem to just be bleeding for no reason.  I really do not remember scraping this area.  I cleansed it off and dried it thoroughly.  Then in looking at it, I notice that it looks a bit like a diagonal cut or scrape, still don't remember doing anything to it, but the thing that really hit me was a small round red place that looks like a blood blister.  I will call my rheumatologist in the morning, but really want to know if anyone has experienced anythign like this.  I hace only been taking the methotrexate for two weeks (two doses) and I am taking the folic acid the day following.  I hate taking the Prednisone, but I think I do not like taking the methotrexate even more.

"I have taken part in a bone clinic offered by our local hospital.  Last week's two hour session was an introduction to what osteoporosis is, how bones form and rebuild, etc., actually quite interesting, although I kind of knew it all it was interestingly presented and provided a context for what was to come.  Second part that week was a good session with a physiotherapist with all the usual advice about caring for the spine in the way we move, etc.  Yesterday's session was another fish altogether.  The dietitian came across as a shill for the dairy industry, which was most unfortunate.  I asked her about leafy green vegetables and she told me the calcium in them was not very bioavailable (true of spinach or beet greens, perhaps, but not true of other leafies, like kale, collards, broccoli).  Then I asked her about Vitamin K2 but after fluffing about K1 and my attempting to correct her course she said I should refer that question to the rheumatologist, who was our final authority.
The rheumatologist was only there to talk about the medications.  I asked her about vitamin K2 and she said there had been four studies none of which had shown that K2 had any effect on bone density.  There were two things wrong with that answer.  First, it's not hard to find information about Japanese studies which show that Vitamin K2 does in fact help improve bone density.  Secondly, there are other good things K2 does, like protect the body from calcium getting deposited in the wrong places.  The final thing which really distresses me.  I went to this workshop mainly because I'd been told that I'd be given my complete bone report.  Well, all we got was the t-score for the femoral neck, a figure I had already with some difficulty managed to find out more than six months ago.  When I asked about finding out the other measurements the rheumatologist told me that I didn't need to know them.  In other words, today I have no idea what the condition of my spine was last September when the scan was done.  I was really insulted by this patronizing attitude, and I don't know what to do to get more information about MY bones.

"Each week I pre-fill my pill box with all the pills I need to take for the week. I have been taking my 10mg ( two 5mg pills ) of prednisone around 5-6 am each morning and did the same today. It is now evening here and I noticed today I didn't feel well and was wondering what was wrong.
I just went to take out my pills for tomorrow morning and noticed that I accidentally filled each days supply with two 1mg pills which means I only took 2 mg this morning instead of 10mg.  That certainly would explain why I felt like cr*p today.
The question is now that it is evening here and I'm not due to take my 10mg until tomorrow morning, should I wait or take something additional at this time to tide me over until the morning. SInce I will be going to sleep soon I can certainly bear with it but want to do the right thing.
Why do they make the 1mg and 10mg pills look so similar .....very stupid ?

"I was diagnosed with PMR about 14 months ago and was on a high doses of Prednisone (30mg) to control symtoms. I am now down to 9 going on 8 (using dead slow and nearly stop method). I know from reading this forum that reducing the lower doses can be hard, especially as one gets from 6mg and below. Compared to when I was on 12mg a few months ago, when I had almost symtoms,  I am now noticing more - generally stiffer in the mornings, sometimes stff fingers and needing more sleep, but I am happier to be on a lower dose and symptoms I have now are quite manageable. Should I wait until symtoms go away or go back to a higher dose? Should I continue to taper slowly despite the re-appearance of some relatively mild symtoms? What tips do people have when I get to lower doses, especially to avoid a full blown flare up and if this happens how much should I increase the dose? If I do have to take a considerably higher dose to contain the flare up do I then have to start all over again tapering down slowly? From what I have read the thing to avoid at all costs is a flare up. Apart from tapering too quickly (which I should be avoiding by using the DSNS method) is there anything else I should do to avoid a flare-up?

"Hi Everyone,
Been on prednisone for 2 years, 2 months, (but who' s counting?) with one major flare, 
i have been on 2 mg's for at least 2 months, and have not reduced, due to midsection discomfort, which I'm guessing isn't related, but, I'm not sure.
in the last 4 days, I've been feeling shoulder and arm ache and fatigue, both sides, which I recognize as a previous symptom of possible flare.
in the past, I've gone up as high as 5 mg, which seems to take away the pains, but I often wonder if a 10 mg shot, or one week pred pkg. , from the doc, while continuing with the 2 mg., might do the trick, and allow me not to have to taper down, again to 2 mg, over, possibly as long as 6 months. 
Has anyone tried anything like this, or some other way to avoid the long taper, again?
Also, how does one determine amount to taper, other than by trial and error?
So many questions.
I truly don't know what I would do, without this group.
Thanks,

"Ive had problems for over 5 years. Extreme exhaustion...very high blood pressure uncontrolled by meds..left illiac stent due to narrowing of artery 4 years ago. Had a temporary reprieve after stent fitted..but it didnt last long before weakness startedcagain with sudden pain in both legs. Left arm went numb. GP said it was carpal tunnel. BP Shot up and I started having angina pain.
5 years earlier when I wa referred to vascular surgeon for stents...he noted that i had bruits in my neck and a heart murmur..but told me it was nothing serious.
Things came to a head when i could hardly walk as legs were so weak and i wasnt sleeping at night cos left arm was so uncomfortable with puns and needles. I insisted that i see vascular surgeon again and insisted on full body scan. Results of scan showed i have lots of inflammation in arteries in neck and thickening and blockage to left carotid branch which is affecting my arm. They also discovered that my bp is way different in both arms. Left side is normal..right side is near 200/120.
I was started on 60mg pred. Now reduced to 40mg. I am 49 years old.
Rheumatologist sent me for an electrical conductivity test . No idea why..but it showed something wrong with muscle at top of left arm. Havent got full result or explanation yet.
Just finding everything scary right now as rhematologist said i will prob need surgery on carotid artery once disease is in remission and it is really tricky and risky. I have three boys with autism at home who rely on me (16 yr old twins) and a 22 year old. Pred is making me feel so ill. Had a sorecthroat since i started and runny nose. Feel very breathless and terrible sweats. My legs are going weak constantly and last week i couldnt support my own weight. I think it is the pred causing these problems. The good news is..i was wracked with pain in back and hips before i started pred...this pain has gone completely.
I am just so scared right now and feeling very isolated and alone.
It is hard to find anyone with this disease to talk to online. Does anyone get any financial support from pip or anything. I cant claim any other benefits (hubby is a taxi driver) but he is doing shorter days to support me at home ehen im having real bad days. I am getting more aggressive in my manner and starting to sink into a depression. I havent left the house for 10 days. Not feeling well and face is brightvred from pred right now. Hair always looks a mess cos of sweats and i am having difficulty with legs weakness. Rheumatologist only checked my arms with electrical test. I am going to ask if he can check my legs too. I have another CT scan next week to see how arteries look. Any advice or just any sharing of your stories would help.

"Hi everyone, I'd welcome your thoughts.  I was diagnosed with PMR nearly 6 years ago at the age of 55 reduced slowly to 3mg pred and 2 years ago had a flare up from which I've reduced to  4mg, I must admit that work was very busy and the thought of reducing further and starting with the high level of pain again kept me at 4mg.   I have lived with an underlying stiffness and accepted it as part of what life is like. I have lost 21/2 stone  I retired last September and was hoping I could start to reduce following a 3 month holiday in Australia however since I've returned home I'm finding I am waking on a morning with more aches and stiffness in different places from previous stiffness , the stiffness is in the tops of both arms from the elbow rather than the neck and shoulders and although some increased stiffness in my hips more in the knees  -could it be PMR flare again?  
I have been hoping that the PMR would burn itself out and I could one day become free of stiffness, are there people out there that have to continue with pred indefinitely for a long number of years? 
I'm also interested in genetic links in family and wonder if there is any connection, my sister has Cushins disease which has resulted in removal of her adrenal gland, both Cushins and PMR appear to have some links however manifest themselves in different ways. 
Thoughts would be apreciated prior to talking to my GP.

Had a consulatation in March past. Bloodd taken and he advised me to reduce to 1.5 mg per week. Had done that successfully with no drastic side effects. Had a follow up consultation with consultant last week. He asked me if I would be willing to stop meds completely to which I readily agreed. I then asked him what the results of the ESR test were. He said they had come back inconclusive. I then mentioned that I had my ESR  taken within the last two weeks. Result was 49. He then said that was too high and advised me to increase the dose to 3.5 per week.

I started with PMR is July 2014, GP did not know what it was but had ibroprofen and Physio until I found this Formum and politely as possible requested my GP refer to Rheumatology. He promptly referred me to Neurology! eventually saw a sympathic rheumatologist in October 2014 who excluded everything else and diagnosed PMR and put me a trial of 15mg - relief was amazing. Although I had read about the effect of steroids I still could not believe the improvement.
I have reduced slowly and all has gone well until 3 weeks ago when the dropped from 2.5 mg to 2mg. I have stiffened up across us my shoulder s next and hips, I am waking at night with pain. I have gone up to 3 mg but have not improved. I do not want to go higher as I have put on weight with the pred and need to loose it as none of my clothes fit.
I went to GP yesterday and had my CRP and ESR done and a neck x ray - you have limited movement and it feels like it has dropped, I just cannot straighten it.
I have appointment on Friday, and he has asked for suggestions. Should I go to 5mg or 15mg or what?

"Hi All,
I am a 65 y.o. male who was diagnosed with PMR the end of April. I started on 15mg for a week and then, without the knowledge or insight that I've gained since joining this group, I reduced to 12.5mg. Luckily, I again did OK with that for about a week and then reduced to 10mg. I have now been fluctuating between 10-11mg for about a month now with a reasonable and acceptable reduction with aches, pains and stiffness. The fatigue is another story with very unpredictable increases and decreases on a day to day basis. Can never predict if it will be a good day or not with the fatigue.
At this point, what is really concerning to me, is the weight gain that I am experiencing. I am now officially heavier then I've ever been in my life with no end in sight. I am sure this is adding to the fatigue and the general feeling of discontent with myself since I can't properly fit into any of my clothes. I hate this side effect and might be willing to trade the pain for a reduction in my weight.
Is there a specific diet that should be followed to minimize weight gain and help with the PMR ?  Is there a dosage of prednisone at which weight gain typically stops being an issue ?
All thoughts and recommendations would be appreciated. Have a great day !

"I had classic symptoms of PMR for about 3 months before being diagnosed in July, 2015.  I started at 15 mg Prednisone daily and have weaned to 6.5 mg. I'm 54 and was quite active before PMR, sadly that has all changed.  I felt really good the first month on Pred. and was able to return to walking my usual 3 miles a day then I started having pain in my calves so bad I had to stop.  I had never experience this before and discovered it was claudication. I have now been diagnosed with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.  I have no risk factors for this disease and have no other symptoms other that the calve claudication pain. Has anyone experienced this after having PMR and do you think it is related to PMR or just a completely different issue. My doctor is not aware of a connection with PMR but I'm not sure he knows that much about it. I have started walking again and am increasing my distance very slowly, stopping to rest when the pain is bad enough.  This forum is a blessing. Thanks to all of you!

"I need your advice. My situation seems so complex I am setting out the facts simply:
I have had PMR for two years since diagnosis.
I am on 10mgs of Prednisolone having tried numerous times to reduce, each time having been presented with severe headaches, neck and shoulder pain (which I assumed was my body telling me it was not ready for the Pred reduction) and I have gone back my safety net of 10mgs.
I arrived in England a week ago to visit my daughters who live here.
I have come to Rochester to help a friend whose husband is bedridden.
Yesterday late afternoon I began flu-like aches in my neck and shoulders. By 10pm I was almost crippled by pain everywhere: head, neck, shoulders, arms and legs, symptoms I have never previously experienced. This was accompanied by the lightest tingling sensation all over (I do haver peripheral neuropathy but this has only ever been in my feet and calves).
I didnot tell my friend about my condition (I am supposed to be helping her, not the reverse) and spent a fearful night Googling my sympoms - and coming up with scary possibilities.
Is this a flare as I have never experienced? While I have constant dull pain, it is any movement that brings on the excruciating, crippling pain.
As a visitor, I don't know whether to find a GP - or if this could be just a flare and I need to up my Pred.
Would so appreciate any advice.

"I have been on Prednisone for several weeks now for PMR.  I have always had some vision problems as I have Retinitis Pigmentosa.  Now, however, I am feeling that I am looking through a very fine piece of guaze.  My central vision has remained very good over the years.  The RP has mostly caused very poor night vision and peripheral vision is very bad.  Since my central has remained good over all of these years, I have managed quite well.  Now that I am feeling that I am walking in a fog, I am becoming very concerend.  I had cataract surgery in both eyes five years ago.  I have not been to my retina specialist since beginning the Prednisone.  I will be weaned off of it over the coming months as I am being placed on Methotrexolate in a weekly dose. Has anyone had similar problems?  I am hoping that the vision changes will be temporary and go away once I am off of the Prednisone.

"A reply by Dan38665 on another post prompted me to ask this question
When tapering/ reducing your current dose of Prednisone, if you experience pain and stiffness, is it in the same areas as pre diagnosis? Is the pain symmetrical? What new areas of inflammation have you experienced as you reduce that are controlled by an increase in Prednisone?
For me, bursitis like pain in my right shoulder and left knee are new. Pre diagnosis, I had symmetrical pain in both shoulders radiating down my upper arms but, it did not feel like bursitis.
As for my left knee, this old injury ( that I believe triggered my journey with PMR) had a different pain upon reduction then prior to. It was visibly inflamed and stiff and painful
Both of these issues took about a month to subside. But were absolutely relieved after an increase in Pred.
My biggest complaint now that I'm steady on 11mg (since starting on 20mg In Feb)
is back of leg pain. It's more of a muscle ache really. Both legs from buttocks to thighs. Every morning and every evening.
For now, the rest of my pre diagnosis areas or shoulders, neck, groin, hips are all in check.
Let's compare!

"I hope the moderator will allow this post with its links but they are very appropriate in GCA and PMR especially as one of the difficult aspects of both is the chronic fatigue that the medication cannot and does not address. That is something we must do ourselves by lifestyle and attitude adjustments - one thing that rarely works is to work it out by exercise. Although exercise is very useful in PMR and very probably does improve the disease state, increases must be adapted to suit the individual patient and to ensure not causing a ""boom and bust"" state where you feel good and do a lot only to become excessively fatigued as a result. Then you rest a lot - and start it all over again. By pacing you can enjoy a much more even lifestyle and know that you can plan to do something and have a fairly good chance of it being successful.
Every month on the Lupus UK forum they publish a ""topic of the month"". This month it is about going on holiday - and how to enjoy it! One of their points is about pacing yourself so you don't run out of steam - important any time when you have a chronic condition, not just on holiday. They include these two links. They weren't aimed at PMR and GCA patients but the concept is the same - and they are well worth reading:
To learn more about pacing techniques and how to apply them, here are a couple of great resources available online;
South Devon Healthcare’s Patient Guide, ‘What is Pacing?’ – http://www.torbayandsouthdevon.nhs.uk/uploads/24053.pdf
Action for M.E.’s booklet, ‘Pacing for people with M.E.’ – https://www.actionforme.org.uk/uploads/pdfs/pacing-for-people-with-me-booklet.pdf
The second is particularly good - even if it is designed for ME or chronic fatigue syndrome, we too suffer chronic fatigue due to an autoimmune cause. Dealing with it is no different whatever the illness concerned.

"Almost 2-1/2 yrs. not PMR...down to 7-1/2mg, feeling stable.
tried tapering several times in the last few months to 7m, but flared instead. Was good on the 7-1/2m for 8-11 weeks before trying to taper to 7m. My rheumatologist believes I have been on the prednisone long enough to worry about spine fracture. My initial
bone scan at diagnosis was good. He has suggested I take Actonal to preserve bone density because a fracture f the spine would be a huge, life-changing, painful setback. I have read the literature.
i know women who have used other bone-saving meds and have suffered irreversible damage. My rheumy will not insist that I take the Actonal, but he highly recommends it. 
I will have another bone scan in a few weeks. Should I wait and see the results before deciding on the Actonal. I have been taking calcium and Vitamin D all along...and eating well. Has anyone taken the bone-saving meds and not had bad side-effects?

my rheumat does shots but so does my former pain doc who did painless ones before PMR dx. He really doesn't know much about PMR. He thought I should have gone down on pred 21/2 mg every 2 weeks. I sent him PMR education materials. On the other hand my rheum should be giving me my total care even though I think his shots will be painful and less gentle than my pain doc. The pain is fairly well controlled with time release Tylenol but is aggravated by my treadmill and stationary bike. I don't want to get more sedentary.

"Hi all. I need some advice please.
I have had a few scary days. I developed all the symptoms of GCA despite being on 14mg of pred.
(been on pred since last Oct)
I had headache, tender scalp. Pain in my left eye and check bone. Pain behind my ear and a funny feeling in my tongue. Lastly I got a generalised swelling over my left temple. Although I had all the symptoms none were that severe.
Yes I was in discomfort but not in agony and I had no sight problems.
I spoke to a GP who wasn't sure what to suggest. He asked if he could ring me back after he had spoken to the other doctors in my practice.
He called me back the day after to say they thought it best I went up to 40mg of pred as GCA was suspected. The doctor also tried to contact my rhumy nurse specialist (Erica) but couldn't speak to her.
Today Erica phoned me today to say she doesn't think it is GCA. (I have spare blood forms here so took it upon myself to get my bloods done as the doctor didn't suggest it) Erica had my bloods back and said my levels had improved since last time and my crp was at 9 now and my esr at 24.
Much better than before.
We discussed the fact that I had taken 40mg for 1 day before test but she still feels the levels would not go that low in just 1 day.
So question 1 do you think I should stay on 40mg. And decrease slowly if I don't need to be on this high dose or could I just drop back to 14mg.
I know we are supposed to go slow but I have only been on 40 for 2 days.
I have very bad cushings symptoms and I fear what this high dose will do with that...
Question 2. I have been getting pain in my upper arms and legs getting worse as time goes by.
Erica believes it's steroid induced myalgia.
She said my cushings shows I do not tolerate pred well. Has anyone else been told this?
Sorry for the essay but need advise please.

"I am slightly perplexed after a visit to my GP on Thursday.  I had taken a blood-test at my local hospital and the next day I was contacted by my local surgery who wished to make an appointment with one of the practice doctors for the very next day, I managed to get an appointment with my named doctor and as usual I requested a print out of my results (not all to do with PMR).  He said my CRP was 5 (normal range 0 – 7.5) and my ESR was also 5 (normal range 1 – 30) so all well on the inflammatory front.  But under the ESR was the Platelet count of 565 (normal range 150 – 400).  I might also say it was 640 in July 14 just a couple of weeks into starting preds and has been ‘high’ ever since.   He was stumped as to what caused this ‘high’ for 2 years and noted that he would contact a haematologist to query!!   The white cell count is up slightly - 11.9, and neutrophil count - 8.6?
I spend 5 minutes on the web only to discover one cause is steroids?
Inflammation – chronic conditions such as Crohn’s disease, or other inflammatory processes. PMR?
Drugs/medication – e.g. corticosteroids can stimulate platelet production  
Reaction to certain medications, including steroids
Is there anyone else who has a high platlet count with steroids?

"I went to see my rheumy yesterday - I only get to see him every 2 -3  months.
A bit of history: I started on MXT in Dec as I was unable to under 20mg of pred and was feeling very poorly. I saw improvements within a couple of weeks and now 5 months in I'm down to 5mg pred. BUT, not without its own set of problems. Sigh...
My liver function tests weren't too flash a month ago, so I had another one last week - it shows slight improvement. Rheumy said that the MXT often 'upsets' the liver in the early days and that it might settle down again. Here's hoping! I was worried I'd have to go off the MXT and then have to increase my pred again. That would have been very depressing.
What was more worrying is that my CPR is higher than its ever been, even at diagnosis. I fear I've hit that point where the pred is barely able to contain the PMR. So I'm slowing my reductions to 1/2 mg a month using DSNS - which I told my rhuemy about - he was most impressed and was going to read up on it. One more rhuemy being educated by a patient! lol
I have one question for you: just about every med I'm on is supposed to decrease my appetite (except the pred, and I'm on a low enough dose that it shouldn't be a problem) so how come I can't stop eating? AAGGHHHH!!!! LOL

Normally I really try to do an ""every other day"" routine as far as really exerting myself. Thank you for any suggestions.

"My general dr wants me to go to a endocrinologist to get help to reduce the steroids.  I hven't seen this subject on here; does anybody know what happens?  I have been taking 20 mg for PMR for about 2 years.  Whenverver I try to reduce even 1 mg, I get what I think is a flare up and give in to taking it to 20.  My SED rate is usually 40 or above, once about 53.  I have other issues, such as arthritis and fibro.  My dr is also thinking I should try to sleep with a CPAP again (I tried once and couldn't take it, but I plan to try again).  Anybody with experience with these subjects?

"I've been taking 3 mg per day for around six months now, I always cut into a strip of three and place on pots along with my other tablets for the day.   Today I had a strip of 2 and an odd one and realised 2 of them are 5mg, I must have been taking 15mg a day for probably 8 days. Reasoning that these are the only 2 X 5 mg left in the pots so I will have cut up a whole pack of 28 and taken 26 over the days.
how shall I preeceed from now on please.

"I'm really in need of working my body. Now with osteoporosis diagnosis and so much muscle loss and Trocanteric Hip pain back, and other PMR pains still there when my Pred wears off... 
I need to exercise, but I'm confused...
I know, low reps. I should repeat several times a day, but forget. 
I'm about to start PT again for hip and will make sure this guy doesn't make me work out to failure like my last experience, ugh.
I have a video for Qi Gong, but I don't like it as he seems to stay with same motion for so long. But as I type this I realize I could just stop and focus on breathing exercises...ha, answered that question.
My butt muscles are so gone now I struggle to keep pants up. 
I do squat exercises but am I doing enough? I feel fairly strong, but I weigh so little now perhaps it doesn't take much. 
I lift weights for my biceps, they actually look pretty good for a woman, Hee, Hee. 
I know we are all different, when I feel good I try to do a little and I mean little extra, but sometimes I'll have new pain. Yoga I can do pretty well, but do tend to push myself...is it too much? I don't know. It is a gentle yoga class, very slow, I like it,,good teacher.
Not sure what I'm asking y'all but maybe just need to hear what others are going through. Those who still feel pains, what kind of exercises are you doing? Yes, I'm back up to a whoppin' mile walking, but sure would like to do more. 
Do you walk several times a day? I walk a lot around house but does that count? Yes, better than sitting I know. 
So...how much to some of you do?

Question for my fellow forum member, I'm now settled on a tapered dose of 14 mg, happily no problems so far, but I find the prednisolone tablets very hard to distinguish one from the other.
I'm concerned that mistakes could happen, my 5 mg are almost identical to the 1 mg tablet, a very slight difference in size that could easily be mistaken.
Would it not be possible for the manufacturer to add a different colour to each to help us control our daily doses?
I have bought a couple of tablet dispenser wallets which means I can sort everything weekly, this helps but I'm still worried.

"I have been away on holiday and home now for 1 month.  I was wondering if other PMR sufferers have had this constant pain in legs and upper arms.  My Dr has tapered my Pred. down from 36mg to 10mg over 1 month, he was concerned of long term use of Predn. which I have been on for nearly 1 year now. My legs only started to improve yesterday, but still sore, even to touch.  He sent me to a Physio and he more or less told me what I have been doing, walking for half an hour each  day and to keep this up, though I am getting very tired and a bit breathless, especially going up hill.  
I am also wondering if other sufferers have had strange things happen to them with this Predn.   I shaved my legs  7 weeks ago (as you do), and the hairs have not grown back, then I discovered very white down hair growing on the sides of my face, my Dr said this is the Predn.  Also I have had a Moon face for 3 months, which is quite worrying.  I am suplementing my Pred. with Panomax 500m which is a Paracetemol, I take 3 to 4 daily, to help with discomfort.
My blood pressure is normal, though my pulse rate has gone up over 100, the physio was quite concerned as it was 118, this has not happened before, maybe it is the Predn. doing this. I am due to see my Dr in another 5 days. 
My last blood test  ESR was normal, inflammation was very high, that was 5 weeks ago.
I have been reading these discussions, and really appreciate your views on all the different problems that are displayed here.
thank you,

Most seniors never get enough exercise. Mother Nature saw there was a need.
In Her wisdom she decreed that seniors become forgetful so they would have to search for their glasses, keys and other things, thus doing more walking.
And Mother Nature looked down and saw that it was good.
Then Mother Nature saw there was another need.
In Her wisdom she made seniors lose coordination so they would drop things requiring them to bend, reach and stretch.
And Mother Nature looked down and saw that it was good.
Then Mother Nature considered the function of bladders and decided seniors would have additional calls of nature requiring more trips to the bathroom, thus providing more exercise.
Mother Nature looked down and saw that was good.

"I have been tapering prednisone from initial dose of 15mg to current level of 7.5mg over 6 months period. Each time I have used DSNS- short version method ( 3-1, 2-1, etc) and had no issue. As I am approaching physiological level ( 5-7.5), I wonder if there is any advantage to stay above that level  and not engage adrenaline glands, or is it OK to continue with taper to reach minimal dose that would keep PMR symptoms at bay.  Does it make a difference? I have read Bristol paper and realize that they had stayed at 10mg for one year (well above physiological level), I see 10mg as arbitrary number, not a result of any research ( I could be wrong). To me the value is the concept that one comes down with dose  to lower level and then stays there for PMR to burn out...
I would like to hear your thoughts, comments and if there is any research on this subject.

I have very bad cushings symptoms.
His line of thought is that as an immune suppresant it will tamper down the over activity in my immune system which is causing the PMR. In theory to re boot my system???
I haven't read on this forum of anyone else being given the same treatment?
Is it due to my age? I'm 45
He suggested this one over methotrexate but said if I didn't tolerate this I could go onto methotrexate.
I am now into week 6 of aza having regular blood tests and all seems fine.

"I just got over a very very bad upper risportory and sinus infection, which threw me into the worse flare I've ever had; I've been using a cane and/or walker for last 4 days. My new GP (she has PMR) told me treats hers, with what she calls ""steroids brust"", jumping dosage up 5 10 or even 20 mg for 3 or 4 days and then dropping back down to regular dosage; AND she never messes with anything under 5mg, after a month or 3 on 5, she stops taking the steroids completely, and resumes them when the PMR starts up again. She says she sometimes is off them for months, and it works for her. We are going to try this method; she will write prescription for 10 & 20 prednizone, as I need them. The rest of the time, I will follow my RAs instructions. Hopefully, I'll be able to get below 20mg, sometime been unable to do.

I went to a Vanderbilt walk in clinic at which time I received a steroid injection and then started prednisone 20 mgs twice a day=40mg a day, taken last Saturday and Sunday ONLY (prescribed for 7 days). The side effects are horrible and I called to see if I could come off the drug on Monday. They told me yes AND without any tapering, just cold turkey. That was Monday and today is Thursday and I feel worse than I did then. I called Vanderbilt walk-in clinic the doctor returned my call on Tuesday afternoon and told me it was the side effects of the medication and it should subside after 4 to 5 days... why does it seem like it's getting worse? Should I go to the hospital it is sure there's not something else wrong

"I had dropped from 25mg to 13mg on my rheumy's programme in under 5 weeks (far too fast I now realise) and after 8 days on 13 had agonising spasm in my back.  Went up to 15mg immediately and stayed there for 4 weeks, but still with pain in my right fingers and lots of depressing back ache.  So 2 weeks ago took myself up to 16mg and told rheumy I would do tapering myself and much more slowly, to which he agreed.  Have felt so much better on 16mg with much more normalo life.  Hope to be on 10mg by Christmas (after a year of PMR) but rheumy wanted me to be on 10mg by June!! Horrors!
Question?
After 4 weeks would it be better to go 15/16 on alternate days for a week and then try dropping to 15mg for say 3 weeks?
Or would it be better to go straight onto 15.5mg? And stay on that for 4 weeks?
I realise it is trial and error and we are all different, but wonder if anyone else has terrible trouble tapering at this level even though this shouldn't be like trying to drop down from 10mg.  I seem to be very sensitive.  Some people seem to be able to go from 15mg to 12.5 with no trouble.

Also it sounds as if people take responsibility for their own medication, putting it up or down as they see fit....is this so?

"A quick background of my journey.... I was diagnosed with PMR in April 2015. Started at 20mg of prednisone, and except for a short flare at 7.5 and going back to 10 (I was traveling to Asia) I am now down to 4.5 mg with no consequence. I reduced .5 mg every 2 weeks. I had stiff neck a couple of weeks ago, worried it was the beginning of a flare, but after a visit to the chiropractor and massages, it's all better! Here's why I said good news for now! Before I was diagnosed, I had shoulder pain and had an MRI. I have a 100% torn rotator cuff and need surgery! My Ortho said he will not do surgery while I'm on prednisone. So, I've lived with it this year. The good news is, I have no pain because I believe the pred masks it! Well, after speaking to the dr, he said he could do surgery if I was under 5 mg of pred. Well, now that I am at 4.5 ( and will be at 4 by the time I have surgery) he said he could do it. Here's my question.....will the surgery likely cause a flare? Am I crazy to have surgery during PMR? Should I live with it until I'm totally off pred and start to feel the pain again? My activities are all normal. I play tennis 5 days a week and golf 1(I'm retired and living in Florida). I'm so afraid to push my luck! Sorry this is so long, but I wanted others to know there is light at the end of the tunnel! BTW, I have all the pred side effects...weight gain (20 lbs), chipmunk cheeks, raised blood pressure and raised sugar, but am hoping weight watchers and lower pred will help me get back to ""normal""!

So they do whatever will get you out of the office without a big argument. They do have a way with words. My appointment with the Rheumy went that way last Friday. A lovely woman but hell bent on going down down with the pred despite my description of pain and symptoms like when I was first seen for PMR. I am supposed t o be going down to 5 right now and I am doing it the DSAS method until I can make up my mind with advice about this being a genuine flare. I'm sure there are posts describing how to back up and how far to go for how long, but I would like to phrase my question in terms of it being a test. From 5mg up to what to really see if it is a flare of PMR or pred withdrawal. Also if as the Rheumy is trying to tell me it is OS, a nice place to blame anything not diagnosed by positive means. So, how much to go to from 5mg/day and for how long to see if most of the symptoms get definite improvement. If not, how fast to return to 5mg? I know this is a common trap we get into but perhaps the answers will be of help to some others fighting the same battle. I knew it would involve me for a long time.

"I went to the doctor because i had sore knees and elbows after my hernia surgery ( i was innactive for 6 weeks ) & they made me get an ecg (completely normal) and have my blood test for Group A strep which came back positive and the doctor said i had rheumatic fever and put me on anti-biotics. I then went to get a second opinion and the doctor said he doesnt think i have rheumatic fever after a short evaluation and sent me to a cardioloogist. The cardiologist said he doesnt think i have Rheumatic fever either and did a ecg which came back normal. I then went to get a 3rd opinion and the doctor said i do not have it either all though she didnt do any checks just heard my symptoms and listened to my heart. What should i do? The doctor said i had athralgia and the blood test came back with strep, who should i listen too?? pleas help

"Hi all. I am struggling just now. I had been feeling a bit better and my bloods have been showing reduced levels of esr and crp. Since being on 15mg of pred. I am now supposed to do my dead slow drop to 14mg but these last few days I have been experiencing something new and it's very scary and extremely painful.
I have been getting excessive tightness in my muscles (arms, legs, neck....& a lesser tightness around the back of my ribs... Not sure if that from holding myself a bit tight in panic/stress though) from the tightness comes a build up of intense pain then at the peak of the pain my muscle will jerk. The tightness is leaving my muscles sore, like after a severe cramp. Also at the peak of the pain before my muscles twitch or even jerk? my muscles seem to be in spasm my hands want to curl up etc.
My question to you all is this... Is this PMR or down to the drugs I am taking?
I am on the pred. plus 50micrograms of fentynl in patch form. I have also started Azathiapine 3 weeks ago (but have had these symptoms in a lesser scale a few weeks prior to starting Aza)
Please advise. Feeling scared. But not sure to go to seek medical help in case they just say it's your PMR go away stop bothering us lol.

"There is an article on PMR and steroids written by Dr Scurr in today's Daily Mail on the 'Ask the Doctor' page.  The link is below and I hope it doesn't take too long to get passed by the moderators:
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3569818/ASK-DOCTOR-safe-taking-steroids-two-years.html
Pity Dr Scurr didn't take the opportunity to alert people to the linked condition, GCA, but at least our cause has been highlighted and someone out there reading the article today might have a 'lightbulb' moment and an answer for their pain.
Most of us will be familiar with a higher starting dose of steroids than the 10-12mg advised in the article, but I am aware that some rheumies are now of the belief that a lower dose will work....hmmm!

"I previously posted that my rheumatologist doubts this is PMR due to my age, 56, and lack of elevated inflammation markers.  My symptoms seem to be spot on, which is why my GP referred me to rheumatology.  After following this forum for the last month, I tend to agree with my GP - my symptoms seem to be match, except for the morning stiffness. 
While I do experience some extra stiffness following inactivity, I don't feel that I have worse stiffness and pain in the morning which eases in an hour or two.  Mornings seem to be best for me.  My stiffness gets worse throughout my busy day, and pain increases the more active I am.  Or maybe the pain gets worse, which makes me tighten up more?  Whatever, I am best in the morning, deteriorating throughout the day.  
Does this sound like PMR to any of you?  Have any of you experienced this?  Your feedback is appreciated.
Thanks,
Martha

my CRP is 4 and I'm on 7mg of pred, I'd like to reduce by 1mg but I'm waiting to see an endocrinologist as my short synacthen test in March showed that my adrenal glands hadn't kicked back in,,, yet!!,, or maybe they never will!!! I'm due to see my rheumatologist on 16th May and I'd like to try 6mg before I see him to gauge my symptoms!! Should I try it, or would I become very very ill if I have no adrenal function at all???

"Here's a warning! I've been on MTX since early January and appear to have been coping well with it.
At the beginning of March, I began to notice that I was losing my sense of taste. It was a gradual sensation, together with my teeth becoming very sensitive, especially to cold drinks/rinsing with mouthwash etc. Bad headaches, but not GCA ones and having a worse than usual brain fog.
I mentioned it to my GP during a consultation about something else. He dismissed it as me probably having an underlying virus. By then, I was also feeling pretty unwell and very tired, but then I often do. I very rarely feel well, except when I'm on 35mg plus of pred.
Last week, I went for bloods at St George's and asked to speak to a nurse about the symptoms. She discussed with rheumy on duty and I was asked to come in to see rheumy the following morning. My own rheumy was not there.
My bloods showed a folic acid deficiency. I normally take 10mg the day before MTX and its now been increased to 5 x 5mg over 5 days. This was on Wednesday (today being Monday) and I began to feel better by Friday. But, I then took the MTX on Saturday and went into a big black hole. I've been almost unable to move, major headache, teeth and lack of taste again, sleeping through the Easter weekend, feeling weepy and down, which is so unusual for me. During all this time of having GCA, I've never got particularly depressed. Frustrated, yes, but not depressed. These are all symptoms of folic acid deficiency. Rather than wait until today to take 5mg of folic acid as I should have done, I started again yesterday, Sunday, but the Saturday MTX has obviously killed off what little store I had.
I'll see how it goes this week, whether the 5 days of folic acid will give me enough before Saturday's MTX. If not, I'll contact my rheumy to see whether the dose can be increased.
I'm feeling so miserable and upset and angry with the whole thing. Rant over!
But it's something to be aware of if you are starting the dreaded MTX journey.

" I just wanted to share a recent experience of mine in the hopes that it will be helpful to someone out there.   MIne is the typical PMR tale of woe - started at 15mg of Prednisone, went down and up a few times, got discouraged, suffered, cried.  Last winter I got down to 2mg and could barely walk so I went back up to 4 - cried again.   At that point I came out of denial and started to pay closer attention to my diet and was able to wean down to 2mgs.  It wasn't perfect, still had stiffness and general soreness but put up with it because I felt better later in the day.   Last month I went to visit my son who lives in Costa Rica.  Where he lives is a health retreat off the beaten track.   Because I didn't have a car, I couldn't get into town where the tiki bars and french fries were so I had no choice but to eat at the center where I had 100% organic food every day for two weeks - not one gram of sugar, zero wheat products, zero alcohol (well, okay, a beer in town one afternoon), zero coffee and zero dairy.  I also was forced to drink a jungle juice concoction that my son made me every morning containing organic tumeric extract.   By the end of the two weeks I had no symptoms at all - no stiffness, no aches anywhere, not even in the morning.  I felt amazing.   Since I've been home I've continued to be vigilant about staying with a healthy, organic diet and have been able to drop down to 1mg.   I've had three rheumatologists and not one has said a word about inflammatory foods, which is idiotic because there is absolutely a correlation!  So I'm just throwing this out there as hopefully a ray of light to anyone who is suffering and hasn't discovered yet the connection between what we eat and how it affects our bodies and aggravates this dreaded condition that we're dealing with.  It's been frustrating to feel that PMR has control of my life, but I'm pretty convinced now that I'm back in control.  As Martha Stewart would say, ""And that's a GOOD thing!""

"I did not join in the last discussion about response to doctors. I know for sure that my doctor does not care what I say to him. When I was first diagnosed with PMR my CRP was high and my Sed elevated.  Then as time and Prednison dosages went by my blood work only spoke when I had a bad flair, and now never changes.
  All my symptoms went to Jaw, head, cluster headaches--GCA--very bad.  Actually went on Prednisone up to 80mg.  That all was in 1013,14,15.  I finally let myself have the temporal biopsy even though I knew it would reveal little.
What I did? How I coped?
Since I go to the Pacific NW in summer I found a rheumatologist near Seattle. WA.  He is wonderful, he listens, and he says-""forget the blood tests just tell me what is happening.  
The rehaumatologist I have in the SW--Arizona, thinks I make up half of what I say.  I finally told him I know what is going on and when I have a flair.  I think he cooperates with me because he knows I have a 2nd doctor.
I have also received help from a Neurologist doing research in Colorado.  He said take antiviral pills for the GCA and try to reduce prednison.  Dr. in NW spoke with him and agreed to let me try.  I have not had GCA symptoms for almost a year now.  But I have PMR flairs every time I try to reduce Prednisone.
My only point in this post is that one needs a doctor who listens and who knows the disease--or at least wants to---and yes, keep reading these posts as so many people have knowledge.  Always read what Eileen says--she is really on top of it and every time I read one of her replies I want to yell ""Yeah!"" and ""Thank you for listening and sharing wisdom and experience.""
I want to change doctors in the SW but he is used to me insisting on myself and what I experience--I find it a challenge.  I am close to reaching out to anyone in my area if they need help--not sure just how to do this.   
Hang in there everyone.

"Hi  This is my first posting on the forum. I was diagnosed with PMR exactly one year ago. Started on 30mgs Prednisolone and quite quickly got down to 12.5mgs, then had a flare after falling and bruising my ribs. Had to increase dose to 17.5mgs. Eventually got down to 7.5mgs but felt VERY tired and irritable so went back up to 10mgs. My GP is very good and lets me work out my own dosage. I am now on 9mgs doing the DS&S taper. My main problem concerns my memory. I've always had a good one but recently I struggle to remember and have to write things down or ask my husband to remind me. I also do stupid things. I've left the front door key in the lock on 3 occasions, once overnight!!. I've read on this forum about brain fog. Is this what I am suffering from? I'm getting quite worried! Perhaps someone could enlighten me. Many thanks

"I'm mad at my doctor. REALLY mad. REALLY REALLY mad. Is that enogh REALLYS? She and I talked in her office for an hour or more. She was wonderful, let me vent. let me say it all. Gave me the secret code if I need to talk. But I'm still mad.  I'm a nice person, but I'm holding onto this anger. I realized yesterday that I'm actually counting up grievances against here. It's like the worst disagreement with your husband, and you have to look at him across the table over the corn flakes in the morning. So yesterday I started comparing this to Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's paridigm in her book Death and Dying, and the stages. There is denial, depression, bargaining, anger, resolution and acceptance. I think with her, my doc,  I got stuck in the Anger stage. So I have to either give up my anger at her (but I want to hold onto it) LOL, and allow her to be my doctor as she was pre PMR or find another doctor. You gals who said I'm nice don't realize that I can also be controlling and stubborn. Someone said something yesterday on here that got me thinking about this. I have such an edge even if I have to call the office. This is not helping me at all. It was so helpful yesterday because it made me think about my attitude toward her.  My hubster and I talked about it today when we were in the car, and I was really acting like a spoiled brat about her. Time to grow up Elizabeth. But even being able to act it out with him made me realize that it's decision time. Grow up and move on, or change doctors. I think that I'll actually be a grown up, and get over it.  LOL.  I have a friend and when she's acting like a contrite child she'll call and say that she was actually a grown up today. And she'll tell me what she did. Then we laugh about it. So it's time for me to act like a grown up.  If I don't then I have to let her off of the hook, and find a doctor who can help me. I think not calling about the med decrease was part of my acting out. I don't know 'cause I'm just trying all of this out, but it seems like I do need to talk with her. So I called yesterday, and she won't be back until Monday.  Drat, and I go to 5 mg. tomorrow. Way too low.   So I have to call and talk to the covering physician, and I want her. I want my Mommy. Grow up Elizabeth, or reduce your pred and suffer.   Then I can blame her. LOL. Thanks for letting me vent.

"Hello Everyone and thanks for all your openness and sharing of information.  There is something special connecting to people who know and understand first hand PMR and the associated issues with its treatment.
 My GP referred me to an orthopedist when I complained of shoulder pain in one arm.  I couldn't raise it above my head and it had persisted for almost two months.  I had some less severe pain in my other shoulder and behind both knees.  The orthopedist took X-rays and did an MRI and saw no tear in the rotator cuff as I believe he suspected.  Physical Therapy was ordered and I complied, feeling tortured by the mild excercises I was asked to do.  
I know I am aging, 66 male, but had been quite flexible and limber until the onset of the shoulder pain.
Because I am a hobbies the potter, my shoulder soreness was attributed to working on my potter's wheel and sitting on my stool must have been the cause of the pain behind my knees.  When I told them I have been potting for over 20 years, so ""why now?"" They said repetitive use.  I was given high doses of Ibuprofen and when that didn't help a steroidal injection in my shoulder.  That did help and even the other pains cleared up, for a week, then it all came back.
On a subsequent visit to my GP for my annual physical, he listened to my complaints and wanted to rule out connective tissue disorders and did blood work.  Results showed ANA negative and Rhuemetoid factor normal.  My ESR was above normal and he mentioned PMR as a possible diagnosis and offered me a RX for Prednisone.
I never heard of PMR and had a follow up appointment with the orthopedist in a few days so I said I would wait to see what he said.
That evening I read all I could find about PMR and when I woke up the pain was really severe and my hands were hurting something awful. 
I decided I needed relief and called my GP for the RX.  
He prescribed 14 days worth of Prednisone, 10 mg per tablet. Figuring Imwill be seeing my specialist and he can treat me.
Now 
fmy question. 10 mg seems low for an initial dose.  If it is not enough, should I expect relief, but not for a full day, or is it too low to even reduce symptoms?

"well, well, well, saw my Rheumy last week. Today I opened the online portal to see the ""summary of visit"".
I looked at list of my meds and saw a list of allergies.
She told me to eat coconut, but I told her I think I'm allergic, I've gotten rashes and often itch after I've consumed it or even rubbed on skin. So I saw coconut was added to the list.
Then I saw Prednisone was on the list and it said, upset GI.
She never admitted this to me, I've told her of chest tightness since the beginning. 
I'm betting since they don't know what else to do, the doctors did nothing but let me suffer with stomach issues. 
I say this on forum for extra knowledge for others since I didn't know what was going on in the beginning. 
I did wonder when I've read about allergic reactions to Prednisone could be chest tightness.  Lovely.

"I was suffering with severe scalp pain, for many months on & off. Then one day awoke to total stiffness, couldnt move.. groin pain arms etc. Started on 10 mil of prednisone it was like a miracle, pain gone. After two months Dr. insisted on tapering me to 5 mil. Nightmare, pain back within one day & after four days of suffering he ran blood tests and all normal. I had to force him to put me back to the 10 mil and of course pain gone but not to the 100& pain free before the taper. Does anyone here know why the pred didnt work quite as much when put back up?
Also my Rheumy is insisting that since my blood tests were all normal it could not possibly be PMR but that is untrue, when I tell him this he gets upset with me. One in five will have normal results & still have PMR.
He wants MRI""s to see if it's degenerative arthritis but why, even if it is what would the tests prove. If Im better on the pred I would still need it no matter what the MRI showed. He claims it's to rule out other things but the other things are all related to rheumotoid arthritis in one way or the other. I'm so unhappy with conflicting Dr's and their opinions and how they just disregard my symptoms and want to look for more problems. Why not treat what they see and trust that we know our pains, we know our bodies.

I researched these drugs & did not  know they are prescribed for anxiety, restlessness & other things but why would someone suspected of having PMR need a drug like this, maybe to shut us up & not bug the Dr.'s.
I am not an anxious person by nature & I feel that my crazy Dr. is now trying to say my aches and pains are in my head.
This is whats wrong with our medical system, they just want to try & put everyone on anxiety meds even when not needed.

"I have been doing the very slow method of reducing. Had pmr going on 11 years controlled on 10mg of pred. Last August had a flare and put on 20mg. I'm at 10 for 4 days and 12.5 for three. Next week will be 10 for 5 days etc. Had a short spell where it had to go back up a couple of months ago. Saw internest today for other problems and he thinks I should try methotrexate. I have read many reports on this great site. Some taking it with no trouble and others with severe side effects. I see my rheumy on Friday and I would like to go in having all the info I can on this drug. Suggestions please.

"Hi all
Well I finally have a date for rheumatologist June 13th
Being driven mad though have pain in hips, above buttocks, thighs, groins and stomach plus upper arms and shoulders.
At present I am working and trying to carry on through the pain but at night it's bad and lying in bed it feels like I have done a heavy gym workout and all those muscles ache. Again in morning it's bad I was up at 6 and now 2 hours later just starting to ease.
I feel trapped in limbo as Dr won't trial pred no painkillers touch it and I have to wait till June before I can even start a way onto a diagnosis. And to top it off I have calcific tendonopathy in my shoulder which again I have to wait till June to sort.
Do my symptoms sound normal for pmr or am I looking at something else do you think.

"Lately I keep getting dizzy when I stand from squatting position mostly, though sometimes from chair.
I bought a blood pressure cuff machine. Taken before lunch it's been what to me seems low.  I used to always be one of those 110/70 types, before PMR, and when I exercised.
lately lows like 80/66 HR 88, 85/63, 91/68, 101/71 with a surprising HR in the 80s.  This seems new to me.  I can assume this monitor not well calibrated maybe?  But the dizziness causing me to check.

"Very frustrated today.  Background:  Due to symptoms and family history, my GP suspected PMR & possible GCA and started me on 20 mg Pred on Mar 4, even though I had no elevated blood markers and am only 56.  I experienced probably 75 - 80 % relief within a week.  I was able to walk normally, burning pain in shoulder blades, neck, hips, butt almost gone. However, my headache and jaw pain continued, as well as blurriness in my right eye. Had a biopsy and she increased me to 40 mg on Mar 24.  Biopsy was negative.  Referred to rheumatology.
I saw the rheumatologist yesterday. She said I definitely don't have GCA because the biopsy was negative.  (I thought this was pretty common.) She said she strongly doubts I have PMR due to my age and no elevated markers.  She had no answers for my symptoms of stiffness and pain, nor my debillitating weakness and fatigue.  Maybe fibromyalgia.  Maybe I'm not getting restorative sleep.  She referred me to Sleep Medicine and told me to start exercising daily again.  (One of my challenges has been conserving enough strength/ energy to get through my very active work days, where I am up and down constantly & walk 5 - 7 miles each day, so I have not been doing any extra exercise in recent weeks, just some stretching.)
She wants me off prednisone as quickly as possible, so put me on a taper schedule of 20mg x 2wks, 15mg x 2wks, 10mg x 4wks, and then check in with her.  Honestly, I'm a little nervous about this.
And if I actually don't have PMR... a little grouch that I've been on pred at all.  And have a 2 inch scar on the side of my face....  Must say, from what I've read here about tx in the US, I was sort of expecting this. 
Just frustrated.

"As a new patient recently diagnosed with PMR, I am on day five of Prednisone.  I take 15 mg and within about 3-4 hours my pain and stiffness is reduced by 90% or more.  It is truly miraculous.  
However, by around 4:30 am I awake with pain in my shoulders and hands almost worse than before I began the medication.  I take my dose and in about 3-4 hours I am great again.
Is this a sign that my dose is too low, i.e. I am having a flare up, or is this the pattern that others experience?  
Today I thought I might split my dose (10 morning and 5 later in the evening) but the pain was so bad I went ahead and took the 5mg about an hour later.  Perhaps I should have waited a few more hours but I needed relief.
I understand each of us is different but I value the input of others who understand first hand what I am going through.

"Hello lovely forum people. Firstly, I would like to thank everyone posting here for their generosity and time in responding to those of us that are starting on our PMR journey. I am 7 weeks into my diagnosis and taking pred, and have found this forum (and Kate Gilbert's book) invaluable. My question relates to GCA- can it develop at anytime? I am worried that it can suddenly 'hit' and cause irreversible damage, especially if I am away from home on holiday. I have just had to postpone a long haul trip on the advice of my GP and rheumatologist because I have pushed myself too much and am now exhausted. I seem to have received PMR as a 50th birthday present and am having some difficulties changing my busy work and social schedule to accommodate the physical changes. 
I started on 15mg of pred and , like so many before me, it seems, the pain and stiffness relief was almost immediate. Fabulous. However, although I paid lip service to making changes in my lifestyle (I gave up my gym membership), I now appreciate that what I really did was go back to normal. No time off work, two 4 hour plus journeys to (boozy!) 50th birthday parties and a camping and walking holiday, in the space of 1 month, and I hit the deck. My GP was concerned that I was displaying GCA symptoms and increased my pred to 40mg.  I saw a rheumatologist within 36 hours, which is amazing. Fortunately, my ESR is normal and the headaches and jaw tenderness are fading. I did not have any visual impairment. I'm now on 20mg of pred and looking to start reducing to 15mg in a couple of weeks. I'm using the lost holiday time to rest. 
I feel that I have learnt a big lesson and am very grateful that I have so much support. But I realise that I am now feeling anxious about GCA. I'm not usually am anxious person and have been very fortunate to have enjoyed good health throughout my life. I think that it's the unpredictability that worries me. So, does the likelihood of developing GCA decrease as time goes on? Or should I just be alert to symptoms and hopefuly settle into this as I am with PMR? 
Its great  to be able to get all this off my chest, family and friends have been brilliant but it's a big adjustment for them. Particularly as I don't look ill, in fact, just as Kate wrote in her book, lots of people, have been telling me how well I look!

"I was going to ask my Rheumy to order a test and decided to research the test name and procedure. This led me to a reference of the NADF which is the National Adrenal Diseases Foundation here in the US. The part of their extensive material available that i landed on was an article by the director about secondary adrenal insufficiency. I hope the content of a few parts of it that I quote here will bw worth your time. To simplify, before quoting, the references to ACTH which is produced in the pituitary are key to the process. This hormone controls the prodution of cortisol by the adrenals. the following extractions were the most pertinent to me.
""The most common cause of suppression of ACTH is the use of glucocorticoid medications to treat a large variety of illnesses. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that act like cortisol. They include cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisilone, dexamethasone, as well as intravenous, intramuscular, inhaled and topical ""streroids"". All of these medications have an effect on ACTH because the pituitary is producing this hormone in response to the body's need for cortisol.When the cells in the pituitary recognize any of these drugs, they sense that there is cortisone present and therefore produce less ACTH. This ACTH suppression from glucocorticoid medication can be very temorary, prolonged or permanent depending on the dose, potency and length of use of the medication. For example, a few days of prednisone will not produce a significant problem, but several weeks of prednisone at a dose of 10 mg will diminish the cortisol level and the ability to fight a stressful situation. Recovery of the pituitary-adrenal response after use of a suppresive dose for more than one month will take about one month. Generally, this one for one recovery time is typical up to about 9 to 12 months, when recovery will often take up to a year or may not occur at all.""
""Once glucocorticoids have been tapered to below 5mg of prednisone, dosing for stress such as illness or surgery is still needed until there is full recovery of adrenal reserve, typically using a guide of one  month for each month that steroids had been used. The most difficult issue is that symptoms of adrenal insufficiency will be present during the tapering phase, because low levels of cortisol are the only trigger to the pituitary to stimulate the return of ACTH production and the restoration of normal pituitary-adrenal responsivness. The longer high dose steroids were given for a disease like asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica or inflammatory bowel disease, the more likely that individual will suffer from adrenal insufficiency symptoms on withdrawal of the steroids. In addition, tapering off the steroids may cause a relapse of the disease that had been treated, causing a combination of disease symptoms overlapping with adrenal insufficiency symptoms. That is why it is very common for steroid tapers to be aborted, with a temporary return to therapeutic doses of glucccorticoids, followed by a slow attempt at tapering if the primary disease is in remission.""
I hope this is of some interest as it involves all of us. My take is that for most of us, we will be taking some pred for the rest of our lives. I'm sure some of you allready have made this aasumption. The main point is that our GP's or Rheumy's are bent on going to 0 pred when they must know the information I have just quoted.

i will be very careful on the tapering of the Pred. I wil wait some weeks to start going down on the Pred.
Learned the lesson - I can't go down I MG / week as my rheumy recommended.

I am also struggling to reduce the amount of medication I need to alleviate symptoms. I have got down to 10mg of Pred after 3 months. I hoped it would be quicker. The only plus side is that my exczema has gone! I am really keen to know if there is the chance that this will go away and I can stop taking the steroids. I feel fat and awful, I hate my face which is not majorly moonish but is definitely rounder! I also keep getting heart flutters. Is this normal? Any help or advice would be appreciated.

"Well, halfway through writing things disappered. Hoping it didn't post because I wasn't done but If there's a half finished post, that's me.
I've managed to get off the prednisone, nice slow taper and I was doing fine, just a little achey, although nothing major, so I thought I'd be proactive and get a Bowens treatment.  I've never done it before but I've read on the forum that it seems to help a lot of people.  Unfortunately,  I'm much worse since I had it done.  I ache all over five days later.  Is this supposed to happen or does it get worse before it gets better?  Wondering what others have experienced.

"I've been trying to formulate this question for some time. Its not the full story of course but three dimensions is sometimes different to two.
I was brought up in the days when DNA was being explored. Immune systems entered the vocabulary later, around 1975.
I guess at one extreme we may have untreated debilitating PMR. And presumably potential long term damage to blood vessels and other soft thingies like muscles and hearts.
At the other extreme of mostly contained symptoms there's side effects from medication. Which brings its own potential long term damage.
The overly simplistic question is whether there is a Goldilocks spot. Where the symptoms are sufficiently contained such that they are tolerable and the side effects are moderately acceptable and no long term damage occurs.
I've said no damage but possibly a minimum of combined damage from the disease and the treatment.
I haven't added activity as that complicates further.
I suspect we are all making this sort of judgement continuously, either explicitly or implicitly.
The gap in my knowledge is the potential long term damage from the disease. To put it into perspective, I suspect my tendancy is towards suffering a bit of pain to avoid the pred side effects.
Which brings me to the guts of the question. What is the long term damage from PMR symptoms reduced by pred?

"Hello,
I was diagnosed a month ago with PMR & possible GCA following 3 months of stiffness & pain in my shoulders, neck, upper back, lower back, hips, butt, with jaw pain and stabbing headaches in my right temple.  My blood levels were normal, but due to symptoms, by Dr started a trial of 20mg Prednisone for 10 days.  By the 3rd day, I was walking normally again!  Stiffness was much improved, still a small amount of pain.  
Following the 10 days of pred, stiffness and pain returned with a vengeance.  I had a temporal artery biopsy a week ago, and then increased to 40mg of prednison.  The biopsy was negative.  My Dr is on vacation this week, so I haven't been able to discuss further with her.
1st question - If this is truly PMR, should I expect stiffness and pain to be completely alleviated on prednisone?  Or is it normal to to still have some mild pain?   I've been on the 40mg for 1 week.  Initially, there was huge relief, then on the 4th day, I had some mild pain return.  That has remained, and I'm also experiencing new tenderness in the shoulder, neck, upper back areas, that I didn't notice before.  
I'm just sort of confused.  I think that I thought I would take a pill and it would dissappear.  Maybe that isn't realistic?  Any advice or information would be appreciated.
Thank you,
Martha

"I'd appreciate some opinions as I'm close to the end of my tether and don't know what to do.  Not helped by a second very bad night's sleep so, in addition to my body being a mess, my head has joined ranks too.  Marvellous!
My Background:
Had may signs (pain & stiffness in multiple joints) of RA back in March 2015.  Long journey of tests (slow NHS) didn't show lab/scan evidence of RA.  In Sept 2015 I had an intramuscular steroid shot on the basis that, if there was inflammation in the body which wasn't showing on bloodwork, it should help.  It did - like a miracle!  Within a few days I felt better than I had in such a long time... but effects only lasted a few weeks, although I didn't go back to the same severity of my original symptoms.
Went back to see Rheumy in Dec 2015.  Base on my body's reaction to the steroid shot, his diagnosis was some form of inflammatory arthritis so started me on Hydroxychloroquine.  Also gave me another steroid shot to tide me over until the HCQ kicked in.  This time though, I didn't get that miraculous effect from the steroid shot.  I really didn't notice any improvement... and no effect from the HCQ either.
Back to Rheumy at beginning of March 2016.  Based on my lack of response to HCQ and last steroid shot, he dismissed his earlier diagnosis and thought I had PMR.  Told me to stop HCQ (which surprised me, as I'd expected him to try increasing the dosage) and started me on Pred.  
Now:
I was on 15mg Pred for a week.  It made me feel a bit better and I'd say pain/stiffness reduced by 40-50%.  The following week I went back and dosage up'd to 20mg for 4 weeks, then I'm to reduce to 17.5mg for 4 weeks, then to 15mg... at which time I've got my next Rheumy appt.  (Impossible to get an earlier one, as he is soooooo booked up.)
I've been on 20mg Pred dosage for all of 2 weeks now and I couldn't beel lousier.  I'm still dealing with all the joint pains and stiffness (albeit still reduced from my original starting point), but now have what I assume are many side effects from the Pred on top... so I feel worse off now than when I started.  I am SO tired all the time (I thought I'd have more energy being on Pred) and it takes so little to exhaust me.  I had been walking 5miles a day very comfortably in February, and now struggle to walk a 1/2 mile.
My sleep is terribly disturbed, so that adds to the daytime exhaustion, though even if I do have a good night, I'm still tired during the day.  Other symptoms are the feeling of lightheadedness/floating, tingling in hands and feet, irritability, weight gain and the endless urge to eat.  I could cope with all the side effects if, overall, the Pred was helping with the original pain/stiffness, but I feel like I'm actually worse off than when I started.  :-(
Questions:
Could it just be that my body needs more time to adjust to Pred and things will improve?  
Should I try increasing Pred for a few days (just to 22.5 or 25mg) to see if that has a positive effect on the PMR symptoms?  
Should I try decreasing Pred to 17.5mg to see if the Pred side effects get better and PMR symptoms stay at same level or get worse.
I'm really at a loss on what way to go and am feeling at an all time low today.  My husband suggested I ask my GP for some sleeping tablets, but the last thing I want to do is add another drug at this point.
I cannot get hold of the Rheumy to ask his advice.  Besides, he still isn't convinved that PMR diagnosis is correct as he said the symptoms/blood test results didn't quite fit... but he didn't elaborate and nor did I think to ask for details.
Sorry for such a long post.  Any thoughts/opinions on what I should try will be greatly appreciated.

"Hi all,
Hope you're all having pain free days. I had a doctors appointment today to review my latest blood tests. My ESR is still raised and the rheumatic screening (done for the first time) has also flagged up. My doc was already planning to refer me to a rheumy anyway, so these results just confirmed it. I have my referral and I get to go via BUPA through work.
My question though is that for the first time, my GP mentioned RA. This scared me rather as my grandmother had severe RA and I remember clearly how she suffered. Has anyone thought they had PMR and gone on to develop RA or been told they actually have RA and not PMR? I'm not trying to self diagnose, just interested in the experience of others.

"Here I am with another questions for those of you who have been living with PMR long enough to have good practical advice.  I'd be lost had I not found this forum.    Where 15mg at one time relieved my pain  it no longer will so I am now on 20 mg daily.  I still wake up with stiffness all over my body, sometimes the flu-ish feeling too but I am not in the kind of pain where I can barely walk. The stiffness stays with me a good portion of the day unless I use pain medication. I feel the best toward evening then I go to bed and wake up again aching all over again.  It makes me wonder if I am taking enough Prednisone or if I still need to increase it?  If 70% improvement is a guideline then I'm probably there however I've also read that you need to be taking enough Prednisone to be effective.  Should I be free of ALL of the symptoms of the PMR while on a certain dose of Pred or does everyone out there live with a certain amount of symptoms that they just tolerate?  Oh to wake up feeling good one day.  That would be wonderful!!  Thanks to all for your sage advice. :-)

"Hi all,
Had my first rheumy appointment yesterday. My blood test results hadn't got to him, but he saw me anyway and I'm seeing him again in two weeks, once he's seen all my results. He's a private chap as I have bupa through work.
Long story short, he dismissed any thoughts of PMR because I'm too young (39). He's unsure of what's causing my hip and neck pain, so he's given me a cortisone injection in my hip and a course of Naproxen. He did diagnose carpal tunnel in both my hands.
I left feeling confused to be honest. He was a good doctor and I didn't feel fobbed off in the slightest, just puzzled. As my hands started to ""go wrong"" at the same time as my neck and hips, surely the pain in all three is being caused by the same thing. Anyway I'll wait for the next appointment to see his further conclusions.
I did want to ask people's advice on the naproxen though. Any hints/tips etc? I know to eat before taking it.

"Hi everyone, it has been about a week since I was on this forum. I have been doing more research and have a couple of questions to run by everyone. First, has anyone ever tried Serrapeptase, a supplement derived from silk worms? When you read reviews it sounds good but I am very sceptical. Also does anyone remember having any type of puncture wound a few weeks before coming down with PMR symptoms? I wonder if it could be some sort of virus. I work with wildlife and seven years ago a few weeks before the symptoms, I received a bad pucture wound from an owl and when the symptoms reappeared a few years later it was under similar circumstances. Just thought it was worth putting these ideas out there and see if we might come to some possibilities. It just seems that since symptoms come on so suddenly, we should be able to find some common circumstance that happened. Thanks, David

"I have recently gone up to 15mg pred from 11mg due to what I can only assume was a flair. I just suddenly got so much worse and was having trouble even lifting my fork to my mouth at mealtimes. This time I have tried to listen to my body and be generally kinder to myself.
I haven't worked in weeks and have been pacing my daily activities...
My question for all you lovelies is this. When experiencing extra pain do you find your muscles go hard. Firm to the touch?
I had an hour or so gentle walking the day before yesterday and yesterday suffered for it. Last night my legs and hips were just so painful. This morning my muscles were so hard and tight.
I have had this before and a gp said my muscles were in spasm. It's like a constant cramp but it's not quiet as severe as cramp. It just doesn't go away.
Could it be the PMR or could it be the increase in pred?
Hoping you may have some answers for me.

"Hi All
I have had PMR since November but my rheumy wanted to make sure I really had PMR before she put me on prednisone.  Fair enough.  I had one steroid injection in Jan which helped hugely (I went from feeling 2 up to feeling 6 out of 10).  The steroid injection is wearing off as I feel so stiff in my shoulders and hips.  Ouch.  Anyway I see my rheumy on Weds and I am sure she will finally diagnose PMR and put me on 15 pred.  The apt are always so rushed although I see her for about 1/2 hour.  Please help me.  What questions need to be asked?  like what vitamins do I need to take.  Some of you mention magnesium, vit D, etc.  Also what are the measurements they will keep track of with my blood test like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
plasma viscosity (PV)
C-reactive protein (CRP)
I think from all of you with your true pain of PMR and living with it probably know more than the rheumatologists so I will do the dead slow method of reducing pred.  Will I need to take naproxen any longer?  
One last question - did anyone else get nosebleeds on Naproxen?  
A huge thank you to everyone as all your comments are helpful and worthwhile.  I mention PMR to everyone I meet (almost) and it is amazing to find how many other people have it.  Maybe if it is recognized more we could get treated faster which would save alot of pain and frustration.
Once again thank you in advance.

"Firstly apologies to all Scotsman. Some of us on this forum are not having the best of weekends so to try and cheer a few of you up I have a joke or two to lighten the load we all bear with PMR.
I was at the bar the other night and overheard three very hefty women talking at the bar. Their accent appeared to be Scottish, so I approached and asked, ""Hello, are you three lassies from Scotland?""
One of them angrily screeched, ""It's Wales, Wales you idiot!""
So I apologized and replied, ""I am so sorry. Are you three whales from Scotland?”
And that's the last thing I remember.
And then there were another Scotish couple.
An elderly Scotsman and woman, both in their 70's, walk into a sex therapist's office.
The doctor asks, “What can I do for you?”
The man says, “Will you watch us have sexual intercourse?”
The doctor raises both eyebrows, but he is so amazed that such an elderly couple is asking for sexual advice, that he agrees.
When the couple finishes, the doctor says, “There's absolutely nothing wrong with the way you have intercourse.”  He thanks them for coming, wishes them good luck, charges them £50, and says good bye.
A week later the couple returns and asks the sex therapist to watch again.  The sex therapist is a bit puzzled, but agrees.
This happens several weeks in a row.  The couple make an appointment, have intercourse with no problems, pay the doctor, then leave.
Finally, after 3 months of this routine, the doctor says, “I'm sorry, but I have to ask.  Just what are you trying to find out?”
The man says, “We're not trying to find out anything.  She's married and we can't go to her house.  I’m married and we can't go to my house.
The Holiday Inn charges £98
The Hilton charges £139.
We do it here for £50, and I get £43 back from BUPA.”

"Hi, I've been on the very slow reduction method and recently got to where I was reducing from 2 to 1 mg. and then, 1 mg. to zero. 
Surprise, surprise! I've been waking up to severe burning/aching in upper arms the legs. Now it goes away after getting up and drinking some coffee while reading the paper, but every morning starts out the same painful way.
My Q: I can tolerate the pain even though I dislike it. Can I presume once I'm finished with the pred entirely, that nature will allow me to have no pain beyond how it is in the mornings? If so, I can spend the rest of my life (I'm 85) with that pain--just so it doesn't get WORSE.

My my pain is very severe at night the way I explained to him was after a few hours in bed I wake with what only I  can describe as a really deep gnawing pain like something is eating my bones always on right side of back over hip! Excruciating have to dose myself up with tramodol or get up.. He is going to do epidural steroid injections to see if it helps me. 
Be good to know if anyone else feels this and what they have discovered it to be

"I saw rheumatologist on Thursday and he thinks 99% that I have GCA and I have to remain on Prednisolone. He is doing further blood tests to eliminate other infections.  I am worried because I still have background headaches which sometimes go away and sometimes get worse.  I also have toothache.  I also thought that when on Prednisolone you put on weight but I have been losing weight steadily since I went to GP on 11 March with my original symptoms.  Does anyone know if throughout your treatment on steroids you still feel headachy and under the weather.  My family took me to A&E last Sunday as the side effects from Prednisolone were horrendous.  They told me to go down to 40mg and the rheumatologist agreed with that.

"Without going into too much detail. Have had PMR for 2 years. Doing very well with dead slow taper. Must be brain fog. At 9.5, reducing to 9. At 9.5 for 25 days-all is well. Last 4 days only took 9. Don't know what I was thinking. What do I do now to get back on dead slow taper? 9.5 for how many days? Then 9 for how many days. Do not want a flate. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Due to move soon so hope that I gat get a better G.P

"I have been on pred for over a year started on 20 mg. reduced down to 5 then alt of family problems it's flared up again. Got down to 2.5 mg and feeling great then the cold weather and getting my business prepped meaning a lot of outside inside cleaning in the cold weather plus getting over a cold and broken nights from a new puppy! But what triggered it yesterday was a very bitter jealous grumpy 80 old member of the family turning up and being negative to me straight away, got me down and last night I was in agony, could barely move. Stress is definitely a trigger. I am not seeng her anymore she is not good for me so today I am upping my dose to 5 mg and will see what happens. It's so annoying and my husband has been a rock! This all originally started when I went no contact with my mother! The crap I had to put up with the smear campaign all took its toll so I think / know STRESS is a trigger. CHILL :-)

"Hi all. Have recently been diagnosed with plantar fascilitis on my left foot although i have felt some pain ever since I got PMR in June 2014. Since reducing slowly from about 15mg a day of pred (approx 0.5mg a month and now down to 12mg) the pain has got much more severe and at times I can hardly walk. Am ice packing etc but this does not help so can anyone advise if they have suffered from this. Could this be a symptom of PMR and by reducing could it make the pain more severe. I also get shoulder pain but this is bearable. Best wishes Dave (tavidu01)

"Hello,
Has anyone managed to control or improve PMR using alternative methods (diet/supplements etc)?
I have just been diagnosed with PMR. I'm 78 and already have osteoporosis so I really, really do not want to take steroids.
I have had my diagnosis for 4 weeks and and have just taken ibruprofen so far.
I totally understand that the vast majority of people need and take steroids, and are grateful for the benefits, but I'm just wondering if there are any oddities like me out there? My whole life I have tried to ward off problems with a healthy diet and avoid taking drugs.
My consultant has explained that I would need to take bone-protective and tummy-protective drugs along with the steroids.
Many thanks, Enid

The medication need further study and is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate steroids- broken bone osteoporosis and the very frail. The drug is currently used for RA.

"Hi all,
I'm so pleased to have found this forum!! I'm 39 and following a bout of flu (my first), at Christmas, I'm being referred by my GP to a rheumatologist for PMR.
I've had three blood tests over the past couple of months, which have shown increasing ESR and worsening anaemia. I feel extremely fatigued and tired most of the time and I have days where the soreness in my hips and neck are dreadful. It's worse at night, morning and evenings.
I also have problems with my hands - pain, stiffness and ""sharp twangs"" of pain and they sometimes go to sleep/numb at night when there is no pressure on them. I also get pains doing things like driving. Does anyone else have this?
Obviously I'm still to be formally diagnosed so I'm only going on my GP, but I'm still so happy to have found others who maybe in the same boat.

But now, this afternoon, I suddenly have painful ankles and hands!
Left foot has been a problem with PMR all along...but never with swelling in the ankle. I have had a little arthritis in my thumbs for years, but it doesn't usually bother me that much. What is going on? New ""bonus"" PMR symptoms....or maybe rheumatoid arthritis, or ? I am vacationing in beautiful weather...warm, sunny...so it is not the cold. Very discouraging.

I was on the coated type of steroid, but as I cut down, I have to have some white ones. My GP says those will make no difference as steroids change the cells in the stomach, it's not the actual tablet going through the stomach that causes problems. However, when I look around the net, many say the white ones are causing problems. Does else know if the uncoated ones have caused anyone else problems.

"It seems that PMR and pred will fight me all the way. Two and a half years since onset and almost two years since Dx and start of pred. I am down to 6 mg now getting ready with my Rheumy's blessing to drop to 5 1/2. I have the usual set of side effects, if there is a usual set. But two months ago the left hip started giving a problem when putting weight down. Had to stop tennis and even used a cane some of the time for balance. The rest period and some tramadol now and then have removed about 80% of the problem, But then the knees went into pain mode a couple of weeks ago. I reviewed my xray from 30 nov last year ""Impression: Mild bilateral osteoarthritis"" I could bore you with the entire conclusion, but it did not indicate anything to give ny current symptoms. So my post is asking if there is any indication from anyones experience to point to a flare? And how many of you helpfull folks experiment with your dose to validate your suspicions.

Where does the pain, weakness and general ill health cross over from GCA/PMR and prednisolone treatment?

"Following a relapse when reducing meds, and with my markers rising again my GP sent me to the Rheumy, she now wants me to have a arterial biopsy and a brain mri.  Initially I was diagnoes with GCA via an ulstrasound which showed inflamation. Also have the PMR.  So off I went to the vascular surgeon who after looking at all my med records agreed with the diagnosis and went on to tell me that in his experience he has not found the biopsy always confirms the diagnosis especially when I have already started the prednisone, been on it for 3months and am on 45 per day at the moment, but still have pain in my left temple and the creepiness in my scalp.  In his opinion with studies that he has done of the procedure he has carried out there is only a 10% chance that the biopsy will confirm GCA.  He spoke to my rheumy and she still wants me to have it, I have sent her message to reconsider, with no reply.  So I am now booked in for this procedure this Tuesday, I have almost decided not to do it, but would love to hear others experiences on this.  The Rheumy's reasoning for wanting this is that as I am not responding too well with the reduction in meds, she wants to add some other medication to the mix to help.  Thanks Sharon

Saw the rheumatologist on Monday who has now prescribed Methotrexate. He's told me to reduce preds again by 5mg every 2 weeks till I get to 10mg then 1 mg a month reduction.

I was started on 20mg of steroids daily and I had to try and reduce these over a few weeks as soon as I did this,whammmm.....all the pain started creeping back in and life was neginning to become unbearable again. I was then put back up to the initial dose and I am just about to start on reduction again, something I am not looking forward to.

"22nd Dec I started on 30mg pred with high CRP and ESR.  I stayed on this for 6 weeks when my bloods returned quickly to normal.   Then dropped to 25mg ok and saw my highly recommended rheumatologist  on 19th Feb who put me on a programme dropping 1mg every 3 days till 24th March. So in just under 5 weeks I will have dropped 12mg and be down to 13mg.   I haven't had any pain luckily apart from twinges in my wrists sometimes, but all my muscles feel weak and I can only walk 1000 steps daily which is nothing for what used to be a very fit person.    I am having easy physio involving using bands to strengthen the backs of the arms and the hips/buttocks and 1 to 2 minutes on my static bike but it doesn't seem to be working much .  I am wondering if anyone else has been put on a programme such as mine as I have bad fatigue and no energy and have to go to bed and sleep for an hour after lunch in order to keep going normally for the rest of the day.   I know that my rheumatologist doesn't like one staying on high doses of pred for long if at all possible and he said if I felt any pain I was to take a strong pain killer like Naproxen (which I haven't had to resort to)  and not to put the pred dose up.  Having 4 friends who all managed normal lives with PMR as soon as they went on to Pred I am feeling frustrated.  I expect when I get down to 10mg and then take the very slow programme, perhaps my normal energy will return??  That's what I am hoping.  Anyone experienced anything similar with a programme like mine?  I am very careful with diet and look normal.

"I've had PMR for 5 years and treated it for 3 years with Pqrednisone. Started at 15 mg and decreased to 0 the first year. Of course it came back so back up to 15 and this time I stayed at 5 mg. this past fall I had a flare. I was put on a steroid pack for a week and then stayed at 7.5mg until this past Jan byword surgeries after my flare this fall kept me at 7.5. Last week I felt another flare coming. My Rhumy wants me to start Methotrexate this week. He will see me again in June, unless I have issues.
I've read of the side effects. What info can this group give me on what to expect? I want off these steroids!

"I called my GP  a few weeks ago to ask for a reduction in Pred since I was taking 30mg until Mar 30, but c/o of SO many unpleasant side effects. He reduced it to 20mg and made an appt. to see him.  So I went on 20mg. w/ no pain, kept the appt. when he said to reduce to 15mg. on March 15 and see him on Mar. 30.  Two days ago, i started on 17,5 mg. on my own until March 15.  I've had no pain since Nov. 1 when I started on 40mg.for one month.  Before the prednisone,I could NOT function, was very stiffened with LOTS of pain and stiffness.  He said when I get to 15mg. we will have to go much slower.  My lab work has not been far off.  What do you think of my doing a gradual reduction to 17.5?.

"Although my symptoms began a year ago I was not diagnosed with PMR until the end of July when the RA Doctor put me on a 15 mg daily dose of Predisone. Within a week I felt like a totally different person. I thought I had my life back. In Sept my blood work showed my inflammatory markers had dropped to normal range. In three months the Dr wanted me to reduce to a 12.5 daily dose which I did. It only took about 4 days and all my symptoms were back full blown. She told me to go back to the 15 for a month and then try again. Again the same results and I went back to 15 for another month then dropped again. Same results. Only this time the RA Dr doesn't want me to increase the Prednisone but take pain meds to help me adjust to the lower dose. I ask if I can at least try lowering the dose slower she agrees so I go to 14 mg for two weeks then to 13 two weeks then 12.5 then 11 then 10.  I want off the Prednisone as well having had many of the lovely side affects that come with taking it so even though my pain is growing I try to stick with it. I see my primary Dr for pain management. My blood work is showing elevated C reactive protein but my RA Dr seems to think it's an acceptable level.  I start PT, and do a pain education class. Slowly the flu symptoms come back as well many nights sometimes all day. I break down many a morning trying to get up to start the day and often cry myself to sleep at night. I go back to my Primary Dr to see how to handle all the pain. She had put me on Cymbalta in January and I thought it helped some so she increased that. I don't like taking so much pain meds but I have to now to get through the days and nights. She does blood work again and my C Reactive Protein has doubled. I get a call the next day that she has talked with my RA Dr and I should go back up to 15mg a day till my apptmt with the RA Dr which was today. The thing is the 15mg is not subduing all the pain like it did before so here I am 7 months later back to where I started only I now have pain in more places than before. Today the RA Dr says she still wonders if I could actually have RA even though I am not manifesting the swelling in the joints that accompanies that. She suggests adding Methotrexate but I dont like adding yet another drug with its own set of side affects to the steroids until I research it.  I have to increase the steroids now greater than the 15mg a day so I can have a life! I would like to hear any input/experience on the Methotrxate and just on the steroid use for PMR in general. I sometimes wonder if I was reduced too quickly !!

"Hi again...i've posted a few times on here but not for a while. I had changed gp's and after a couple of appointments we seem to be singing from the same hymn sheet. I was in quite a bit of pain and really fatigued so upped my pred from 7mg - 10mg and although i still had niggly aches and pains i was satisfied i'd done the right thing. Over the past couple of months i've had LOADS of different blood tests...the first really since diagnosed...they all came back normal except a liver one which has been looked into and then during the week i was told my vitamin D level is VERY low 25..(docs words not mine) she's told me to wean off pred and alendronic acid as the Vit D deficiency must be to blame as no other test points to PMR...so this week i'll go down to 9mg next week 8mg and so on. I said to her what about the pain and she said pred isn't a painkiller so it won't make any difference, hopefully the vit d capsule i've to take will kick in and i'll feel better. Steroids just make people 'feel' better not make the pain go away. I have a horrible feeling i'm going to very quickly feel awful...i'm trying to keep positive but i don't have much hope

"I've read that 600 mg of pantethine a day assists in the production of natural steroids.  It would therefore make sense to me that you could take pantethine and this would then enable you to reduce the amount of Pred taken daily - has anyone tried this?  Does it work?

"Having Temporal Arteritis there are three years and on Pred, actually I don't have pain on the temples when chewing,neither on my neck, or jaws. Never had sensitive scalp either.
What  bothers me a lot is this feeling if pressure , yes, pressure, not pain as the doctors use to name it.
Is like to touch the table with my orbital area.
I thank in advance for your replies.
Somedays, like this morning the feeling of that was over my entire left eye.
i have flare ups every time my rheumy insists on tapering too fast the Pred.
Again the amount of Pred has to go little by little higher until it reaches the level where Imferlmit is ok.
my rheumy as most part of them follows just the result of the blood test - SED and C RP which were fine a couple of weeks ago, I know that I know , the inflammation is there though!
i would like to ask if someone, carrying GCA have this symptom like pressure on the half part of the face where the affected eye is.
got a higher amount if Pred.
thisbis exactly what is happening.
i was in 9 MG because the flare up I eas on 18mg  until the moment  few bugs minutes agonI took one more MG and finally the symptom of pressure is totally gone!

"I just found there is a list with inflammation factor of foods.
Kind of interesting.  Pre-PMR I was drinking a cappuccino atleast 4-5 times a week and had food poisoning on either pork or stuffed mushrooms from grocery store and was in highly, highly stressful situation when PMR hit, and yes, other stress two years.
I'm wondering how much do inflammatory food play role.
But I wonder if the inflammation causing by foods is over long period of time. Or does it just increase inflammation if already have our wonderful inflammation condition. And do anti-inflammatory foods really bring it down. 
Anyone see any studies or have experience with the foods? 
Search inflammation factor to find list if you want.

"today i went to see my Rhymi after i had some blood tests done.
She was pleased with how things are progressing as all my test came back clear.
I explained about the pains and aches, earaches i was having and she said shre thinks this is a nerve problem , and she did not rule out GCA and told me that if i had severe jaw pain and pain when eating, blurred vision to go to A and E.
Also she said at this stage a temperal biopsy would not help as it can come back negative.
She is really take care of me and i have every faith in her, but sad to say she is leaving, but next time i go i might see Dr Sarah Bingham, or one of the other doctors. I will be having another steroid injection in May for the pain and inflammation in my feet as the Dr,s who gave the last one recommended it one more time.
Sometimes i get the feeling of numbness in my face and lips and jaw, does anybody else get this feeling please.
Also i was told by the doctor to keep lowering my dose of steroid but VERY SLOWLY using the dsns method, (now going to 6.5mg) as she was impressed by the system.

"The first rheumy I saw told me he wanted me to be at 100% before I started reducing prednisone. I've resisted prednisone from the start so I substituted, ""I could live with this"" as my acceptable level before giving up the next mg. I've now been on prednisone for 2 years. I’ve gotten as low as 1 mg but haven’t been able to stay there. 
Here is my question: What does felling 100% mean to you?
My worry is that I’ll get off of it entirely and still be living with a level of pain. In the course of my day, there may be periods of time when I don’t think about my body hurting, but by morning, I’m always stiff and sore. My knees don’t bend fully. I’ve lost my ability to crouch down or to sit on my feet (if you know the Yoga position Child’s Pose, I can’t do that) I have limited range of motion in my neck. Even when I’m feeling “good,” if I evaluate every joint and muscle, there is always something not working fully.
Feb. 18 I got down to 1 mg but within 10 days was in such pain I’ve gone back to 5 mg. Now I’m back at “I could live like this.” Sitting here at my computer, I feel no pain. When I stand up, I have to slowly let my muscles stretch out before I can start walking, then I feel fine. 
Only I don’t want to live in pain any more. I saw on this site about the Dead Slow and Nearly Stop Reduction Plan. It was like a lightbulb came on. I really want to use that plan. I can see how it could allow me to reduce without the weeks of torture as I’ve had each time my body had to adjust to giving up another mg. 
What I’m at odds over is how high to go to get the results I want before starting the Dead Stop plan. I might want to go to 10 mg and feel great before reducing. That’s where I’d like a description of what 100% looks like for you. Thanks for your help.

"I started with foot pain over 18 months ago whilst on 7 mg of pred,
the poditrist was going to operate on bunion which had dislocated my second toe.  My doctor refered  me to orthopaedics so that I could have the op in hospital and have a pot put on to prevent any accidents whilst doing my caring role for my husband.    After many months of appointments,  x rays and ultra sound the consultant has said 'the ultra sound is has shown fluid retention on the 2nd 3rd and 4th metatarsal phalange all joints on the left side, nothing on the right. 
X rays show a mild degree of hallux redid us, the right worse than the left.   I think a lot of the pain is due to the the PMR which she is known to have and she is on steroids, a small dose of 3 mg.'
I went to the doctor to ask how to manage the pain but she is saying my PMR is under control at 3 mg, not to increase.  I don't want to put up the steroids either, as in the begining of said foot problems I was on 7mg and with the decrease it hasn't got any worse.   I am finding  it difficult to walk, stairs particularly coming down them is very difficult.
Im having a PIP fusion and an extensor tenotomy on the toe which turns out is not dislocated but a hammer toe.
Any thoughts for me please
Any thoughts about why I'm in so much pain? The orthopaedic letter all looks to be mild symptoms, I'm getting worried that the pain is never going to be controlled, I've already been off work for a year, maybe I'll never return, I'm 62 yr old.

"I am 2+ years into PMR and thru ups and downs have learned the hard work of tapering slowly (Eileen's method). I tapered from 7-1/2m to 7m just over two weeks ago and I am having pain, issues, so I have decided to stay at 7-1/2 a while longer (I had been at 7-1/2 for 6 weeks). So when I went to my written ledger to record my dose and progress I noticed that back in March-May 2015 I had spent 43 days on 7m!!! BUT, my records indicated that those 43 days were somewhat miserable. So, I must go for the pain free dose, longer, rather than get distracted by tapering...correct?
This prednisone has scrambled my brain! Thank you for any comments.

"I have PMR & GCA, diagnosed early December, 2015, started on 75mg for 3 days, instant relief, then went back to 60mg for a month, still travelling well, apart from side effects, then down to 50, still OK.  Saw a rheumy and she wanted me to go down to 40 one month and 30 the next month and so on.  Dropped to 40 had a flare up, so with advice from you guys went back to 45 for 2 weeks and then 40 for 2 weeks.  Not so good.  Blood tests showed that my markers had gone from 12 back up  to 39, and all the pain in my head, jaw etc, neck and shoulders hips etc came back.  GP has put me back onto 50 for 3 days and then onto 45, this is my second day of 45 and not so good.  Still a lot of pain from the PMR as well.  I note that you usually do not have to have such a large dose for PMR, but mine is still acting up on 45.  I am back to have a blood test in 2 days, to see if the meds have lowered the markers. My GP has spoken to the rheumy (whom to be honest I think I knew more about GCA than she did), about this flare up so will be seeing what they want me to do next week.  Anyone else had this experience?  Thanks

That was only way I could get out of bed in morning and it worked for me. Cut evening dose too fast and all pain came back.  Now I'm tapering down from 40 by  2.5 every 7 days. I'm okay but now I'm at 10mg night and 12.5 mornings.  Doctor said To try and get to 15.  How slow should I taper from 22.5 to 15   I know from posts to go slow and don't be impatient. We all ant off pred but I do t want to start this taper from high dose again by going too fast.

"Hi all
I'm looking for some help here. I've searched the message boards for the answer to this question with no luck.
I'm newly diagnosed with PMR. Today marks the 2 week point of taking Prednisone. 20mg = 10 mg 2X a day.
I must say it has been a life saver from the pain. Other than some issues with my tongue and taste I've had no side effects.
However, today I woke up with blurry vision which lasted about an hour. It was unnerving at first as I thought maybe GCA. But, as I had no headache or jaw issues I thought ok. Off to work I went
Here's the problem: by 10:00am blurry vision is gone but, I'm nauseated, dizzy, shaky, weak, lethargic and feverish. No headache but my head feels very heavy. Really not well. I came home.
Is it possible it has taken 2 weeks to feel side effects of Prednisone?!?! or do you think perhaps I've caught a bug with lowered immune system?
I'm supposed to take my dose now but, really can't eat a thing. Prednisone has been a God send to me reducing the dibilitating pain I had.
I'm hoping it's not the case. Thank you in advance.

"I have been diagnosed with Helicobactor Pylori and severe gastritis.  I have just reduced to 71/2 pred am also on metoprolol, PPI and ranitidine.  I had the same problem 13 years ago and was very ill with the treatments to eradicate, both the triple therapy, then the quadruple therapy.  
This time  I have been told I am to have 5 days of 2 antibiotics followed straight away by 5 more days of 2 different antibiotics + the PPIs and bismuth.   My worry is, how will all these extra antibiotics interact with the pred ?   Is it likely to have an even worse effect on me than the last time when I wasnt on the  pred ?   I would be grateful for any insight and advice on how to deal with this.   I also wonder if anyone else has had the same problem.  My doc thinks the steroids are to blame this time. 
I was also on Propafenone for my arrythmia but was taken off it as I developed hepatitisi which is apparently a rare side effect. So my liver is recovering from that as well.
I would be grateful for any advice on Pred with antibiotics - and has anyone had similar problems ?  Thank you

"Not been on here for some time, although I do get a lot of E Mails which I read with interest. About 18 months ago I was diagnosed with PMR, and went through the usual Preds and then decreasing them etc: Last year I was really ill, had alsorts of tests, lost a real lot of weight, and was in terrific pain. I was so bad my family were really concerned. To cut a long story short I had to go and see my COPD consultant, and mentioned I had quite a bit of chest pain, and he started to ask about my prior bout of PMR. I went to my GP who started me of on 15mg of Pred. Within 2 days, like before I was a different person, my pain had gone, and of course my appetite increased. I decreased to 12 - 5 after a month, within 3 days of the decrease my pain started to return. I am now on 10mg, have been back to GP, who wants me to carry on at this dose, as she is not happy on putting it back to 15. I am supposed to decrease in 1mg every month until I am off them. At the moment I am in so much pain it is really stopping me doing much at all. I really would value your comments, as I can't understand why I have to come off them when I am in so much discomfort.

"I was diagnosed with PMR and Temporal Arteritus early December, 2015.  My initial dose was 60mg for 2 weeks which mostly controlled my pain, except in my left side hip area and thigh.  My doctor did not think this related to my pmr, but it did improve over those 2 weeks and my bloods were down so I went down to 50mg, which was holding OK.  I was then put down to 40 from the 1st of Feb and within 2 days the pain in my hip returned and my temple pain reappeared but not as bad as before.  I have now put my meds up to 45, this is the 2nd day and there is some relief but only minor.  As it is early days for me I would welcome advice and information about what to expect when lowering prednisone.  My rheumatologist has given me a program whereas she wants me to drop down 10mg every month to get back to 10 per day and then start dropping it by one.  I imagine that this is a recommended procedure but that everyone is different.  Before treatment I was at the stage where I had blinding headaches and extreme pain in my arms and I could not use my legs very much, had to get a walker to get around.  I am now moving, but still with a lot of discomfort.  I was wondering if the pain in my thigh could be from the Temporal arteritus and if I should get scans done of my main arteries in my legs to see what is happening.  Thanks Sharon

"I have general questions on those 3 above.  Recently I have experience side effects ( I think) from the above medication and would like to decide if it is worth taking anything in addition to prednisone.  Side effects are mainly with stomach and lately with cramps in the leg muscles. First I had constipation for month or so; lately it is soft stool, and frequent bathroom visits.  I think side effects are caused by complete change in the bacteria culture in the intestines killed by antibiotics. What also does not help is PPI interfering with mineral absorption and ( most likely) causing low potassium and magnesium levels and thus muscle cramps.
So:
- How often are antibiotics and PPI given along with prednisone?
- How necessary is PPI if I take split dose, 5mg each, and with lots of yogurt?
- After taper, at what level of pred one does not need antibiotics and/or PPI?
I have my monthly appointment with rheumatologist this week and would like to prepare for it.

" I have recently been diagnosed with GCLA. After being discharged after one visit at Kings Mill Hospital because my blood test shewed no inflammartory markers. I was seen at Chesterfield Royal Hospital and diagnosed with the above. At both places I was displaying many symptoms and visual problems. I thought at first I had started with a left sided migraine but it continued for two weeks with scalp and temporal tenderness. I was sitting with my eyes closed because of problems focusing but the first Doctor ignored my symptoms. I am now on 40 mgms of prednisalone and visual problems improved very quickly.
I was treated by my GP in the past for a similar attack but not as severe and was given Prednisalone prophylactilly.
I am having a Temporal Biopsy in the next few days though these are not always positive. I had another test similar to the one for colour blindness and was shocked that I could not see the figures in the spotted circles. I'm not sure what this is called. I scored nil for left eye and 13 out of 15 for the right eye.
I have problems with Polymyalgia as well and flare ups occasionally.
Despite this I am a very positive person and try to enjoy life as much as my age will let me. I am a young 79 year old.
I think having this sort of attitude can help a lot to ease pain because life is for living.

"I have been reporting here on my being able to get away with skipping one day's dose weekly, then working my way toward only every other day at 5mg.
This was a very big step from the previous month's 5mg per day.
Since I often awoke in pain in the middle of the night following a skipped dose (then having to take 2mg just to get back to sleep), I've adjusted my dosing to 3mg taken daily, but taken late in the day for least disruption to my sleep, i.e. minimal symptoms (like ear-ache and severe shoulder pain) during the hours that were most problematic.
I've experienced some mild fatigue, but not too bad. And by now I seem to be rid of wrist-pain flareups, which previously resulted from lowered dosing.
Still dealing with ribcage pain, most noticeable when sneezing, but that is one of just a few remaining symptoms that are defining a minimum effective therapeutic range of prednisone.
I've had to moderate my exercise duration due to very cold weather, but still doing a minimum of one hour daily, combined time spent cycling and running, plus some light barbell lifting within my steadily-increasing range of motion and loading.
So in summary, it seems that a minimal dose, taken so as to target the most troublesome time of ""day"", is allowing me to taper at a faster rate these days.
For background info, it has been exactly two years since my pmr symptoms first came on intensely within a couple of days. I began treatment @15mg/day after a long three months, and reached 5-6mg some ten months ago. I was stuck at 5-6mg/day for many months but finally have broken free of the 5mg level and am feeling good, with quite-tolerable symptoms.
I will follow up with any more changes in my progress!

"I'm 71, and I developed PMR three years ago and tapered steroids over a year's time for the shoulder pain, but after that time I seemed to gradually develop morning stiffness/pain in my fingers such that I couldn't make a fist until mid-morning. This settled into a managable level but for the next year, but, two months ago I had a flare of PMR with elbow, shoulder, and hip pain and I went back on prednisone (now needing 20 mg/day to control those symptoms - vs 10 mg the first time).  The finger joint pain however has gotten worse, and now I don't have full painless motion until mid-late afternoon!  There is no visible swelling or reddness in these joints like I'd expect if I had RA.
Supposedly, in PMR, the joint pain is from tendon sheath edema as well as joint inflammation but apparently there are no erosive changes like those seen in RA.
My questions are:
a)  is this finger pain/stiffness typically seen in PMR? Seems weird to me, especially with other symptoms controlled.
b) what's the natural history of this finger joint pain - will there be any long term residual?
c) should I be upping the prednisone dose to see if I can get more relief?
d) should I be considsering methyltrexate?
My doc doesn't know the answers to these questions.

"Diagnosed with PMR Nov. 2014, and put on 20 mg. of prednisone daily; 8 tablets - 2.5 mg. (20 mg. total) of methotrexate 1 x weekly; 1 mg. of Folic Acid - 1 x daily; and Actonel - 150 mg. - 1 x monthly. Did well, felt good, little discomfort, and then started the tapering of Prednisone and down to 10 mg. I tapered to fast, had a bad flare last March, and back to 15 mg. and felt good again. Then back to a very slow tapering. This past Nov. 2015, my rheumatologist said that I had moved into RA, and added Pacquenil - 200 mg. - 2 x daily and to continue tapering  the prednisone with the hope I can get off it. Now I have occasional stiffness especially in the shoulders, and legs and thighs. 
I have finally worked my tapering of the Prednisone to 7.50 mg daily and working on trying to get to 6.25 mg.daily.  The stiffness in shoulders, arms, thighs, and legs keeps getting worse as I take less Prednisone. Just wondering if anyone has experienced this as they tapered Prednisone, or if it's the RA or PM? Also can you have RA and PMR both at the same time? My rheumatologist says that I have moved from PMR to RA, but my major complaints are the stiffness in the shoulders when raising my arms, and stiffness in my thighs, and legs which are PMR symptoms.

"Recap -
I was struck with PMR in late January 2015 and diagnosed March 3 2015.  Had two 40mg  (?) kenalog (long acting cortisone) shots, one in my left shoulder and one in my right knee and also started on 10mg oral pred a day.   A few weeks later had another kenalog injection in my right shoulder. Then a few months later a repeat kenalog  injection in my left shoulder.  
These injections brought me TREMENDOUS relief.  
Have been reducing the oral pred slowly. Had to go back up after a major flare from the stress of losing my best friend suddenly to a brain aneurysm in September 2015.  
My most recent blood work from about 3 months ago shows everything is no longer elevated but is now within ""normal"" ranges.  
I still have some PMR shoulder pain, but it is manageable.  
I am now down to 4.25mg oral pred per day.  Like so many of you, tapering by even .25mg can make me feel just wretchedly awful for a few days...
For me, I have found that if I can ""tough it out"" for a few rough days, my body seems to eventually adjust.   I have been waiting until I have one week of feeling ""comfortable"" (not necessarily totally pain free, but where I'm managing well enough to get through my daily routine) - then and only then do I taper down by another .25. 
Some .25 tapers have been easier than others.  I have also made other small changes such as eliminating almost all sugary foods (I still allow myself a small treat now and then).   I avoid most all processed foods but do enjoy foods such as a portion of gluten free crackers now and again.  
I have not given up my nightly 2 glasses of red wine.  
What I'm doing may or may not work for someone else.  I feel there is a difference between the lingering PMR pain I have versus what I think is withdrawal/adjustment pain due to the pred tapering.  
On those taper/feel awful days, I do need much more rest. 
I have gained about 15lbs (ugh) but am trying not to worry about it until my PMR is stable. Hoping for remission.  
My heart goes out to anyone struggling with this awful disease.
Sharing in case my story might help someone else.  
Blessings to you all.

"Statins are powerful anti-inflammatories
     I recently read that statins are potent anti-inflammatories. I perked right up and thought to myself that is just what I need.  I had stopped low dose statins when I got PMR just to prevent confusion, since statins cause muscle problems in about 7% of patients.   But restarting statins would require a lot of research.  Not one of my doctors had suggested it.  I am happy to say the results have been very encouraging.
    First, I found that the knowledge that statins are powerful anti-inflammatories dates only from 2002.  Since then a lot of research has been done on whether statins could help other diseases, not just cardiac problems.  So I would have to plough through a lot of research. 
        I remembered Eileen of this forum is down on statins since she had severe major muscle problems and was on crutches for a time.  But still the words “powerful anti-inflammatories” were compelling enough that I really wanted to look into it.  And I am very glad I did.
        I read about a clinical trial of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on 40mg Lipitor (atorvastatin), and after 6 months “CRP levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate reduced by 50% and 28%, respectively, relative to placebo.”  Also the swelling and inflammation of RA was greatly reduced.  This again sounded like just what I needed since my CRP and sed rates have been higher than ever recently, despite all the prednisone.
     In September PMR inflammation went to my lungs and in October I had to go on oxygen for a couple of weeks.  Just feeding the dogs would leave me gasping for breath.  It was a horrid experience.  Not being able to breathe is really scary, far scarier than muscle pain.   Since then I have been on 3 quick high dose prednisone regimens, but they only helped temporarily, and the problems would return.  So I wondered if statins would help my breathing.  More research, and indeed I found that statins help respiratory problems of all kinds. My respiratory problems were interesting because I had neither a cough nor wheezing nor crackles.  My lungs sounded and looked clear, but I could hardly breathe.  That's why they thought it was PMR inflammation in the lungs.
      Next I wanted to know if I could distinguish PMR pain from muscle pain caused by a reaction to statins.  I found muscle pain from statins is more likely to be in the major muscles like the thighs and not in the typical PMR bilateral shoulder girdle area as I had had.  Also the major muscles were weakened, which is not a trait of PMR.  And apparently taking CoenzymeQ10 at the same time as statins can alleviate the statin muscle problem.
       CoQ10 has definitely helped an Indian friend of mine who had to go off statins many years ago because of muscle problems. He had open heart surgery two years ago, and his doctors still wanted him on statins for recovery.  (Reducing inflammation is always important!) The CoQ10 has made the difference and now he is taking atorvastatin without a problem and is playing tennis.
     There was even one study some time ago that said statins might even cause PMR.  OK I looked at that one too.  It was a lousy study.  It was a retrospective data analysis on data collected for another purpose.  There was a lot of data manipulation, and it was the exact kind of study that so often yields spurious results.
     I still had a large bottle of atorvastatin left, and, since I am an incorrigible experimenter, I started it 10 days ago at 40mg. (I had been on 10mg the year before, so 4 pills did the trick.) I didn’t expect it to work quickly, but it has!  My breathing is vastly improved already.  Statins are pretty safe drugs, so safe that I read they are sold over the counter in the UK.  To me statins are an infinitely better idea than the methotrexate my pulmonary and rheumatology doctors wanted me to be on.  (Methotrexate, from what I’ve read, is pretty nasty).
With statins, I feel like now at last I can actually start reducing prednisone and still breathe. I can now hold my breath for 38 seconds ;10 days ago the best I could do was 12 seconds.  Also today I recovered normal breathing quickly; 10 days ago recovery was difficult and slow with prolonged gasping. 
    Now I have to figure out how to tell my primary what I did so I can get another atorvastatin prescription!  She really dislikes my self-experimentation, but this is the first thing that has worked other than high doses of prednisone.  And I have to restart some exercise!  Gladly!
      There currently seems to be a lack of ANY high quality clinical trials of statins with PMR/GCA, but if you have breathing problems in addition to PMR, it might be a risk you want to take as I did.  We know it helps RA.

They also moved  around  affecting left side of neck and head, now, as well as back of head.
After MRI of brain and neck (negative except for old age stuff), a checkup of the eye for GCA (also negative), and a visit to the dentist, who didn't think a tooth was the problem, I am still having head and neck issues........mostly head.
is it possible this may be a new fangled symptom of a PMR flareup?.
i'm totally perplexed and unhappy, and would appreciate any feedback.
Thanks,
barb

"Trivia - I know, but I'm looking for something positive to lift my spirits today.
It has fascinated me for a while that as soon as I started taking pred, the dry skin which I had suffered from for years, did improve and has stayed that way. And my fingernails, which developed vertical ridges about 20 years ago when I was diagnosed with Fibro, have improved no end. Wonder what Chinese medicine would say ?
I just caught up on about a months worth of discussions and am now feeling rather down, or downer should I say. Pred is taking its toll on my health, like everyone else, and reality is, there just aren't any answers out there for us yet.

"Had a rocky start with PMR in October 2014 with an original effective dose of 20 mg Pred, then fell into the hands of a rheumy who set me on a quick reduction path.  Major Flare! Went back to my PCP ho put me back on 20, no effect, then 40 to ""nip it""  Did a reasonable reduction to 30, then 25 then 20 in early 2015; blood tests each step showed markers under control.  After 20 doc recommended 15, but I convinced him that 17.5 would be better, and it's been nearly a year now,  Maybe 3 blood tests, SED and CRP still elevated.  I had another blood test yesterday, cause I see the Doc this week, but I know from my arm and shoulder pain that they're still elevated.  Do we need to go back up to 20?  I hate that. Btw, in the meantime last year, I had a very successful hip replacement,  and undergone radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Hell yeah, getting old is no fun!  This year we need to make sure the cancer is under control, I need two new knees, and I would love to get Past this pain! And I still go to work 5 days a week - for a few hours!  I'm 67, semi- retired.  Suggestions?  Back to 20?

"This was just a fun surprise.  In the states we love to watch Doc Martin and are at the mercy of public television as to what episodes they show or repeat. This past week Doc Martin's diagnoses his aunt Ruth with Poly/GC and I found it very refreshing to see in a TV show!  A previous episode had a waiter who had it but this time Doc even did a biopsy on her neck artery! I LOVE that show.  Then I saw that the PMR charity had done a writeup praising the episode.  I don't know if you all already discussed this or if I can post the link but I found it very interesting:

"So when diagnosed with PMR my ESR reading was 70.  Two months later and its 23.  I understand normal is around 20 or below so that's great.  Quite a drop.
Just to understand clearly - is it the Pred that has decreased the inflamation - rather than me just getting better?  If I were to reduce the Pred is it possible that the inflamation would increase again.  Is it a good indication that I'm on the right level of Pred?  I'm on 9mg, I have some niggles and feel the cold, but otherwise have no pain.

"Just commenting....
It comes and goes. Between shoulder blades.
Amazing, as Eileen has commented on the workings of inflammation.  Last night (this often happens now) I woke up at the perverbial 2:00 (ish) a.m. time frame, upper back just on fire. I get up, go to bathroom, try to shake it out, and somehow manage to go back to sleep.  Then 4:00 a.m.! Awake again! Serious burning back. Ugh...I stretch it a bit, use bathroom...manage to go back to sleep, how I don't know... Then about 7:00 a.m. I awake...no pain.
Interesting huh? 
I know others here with PMR mentioned the same area of pain, so I'll assume PMR. 
Kind of also wondering if my Pred acid reflux is causing this pain, I'm kind of starting to see a correlation, but jury still out.

"Hi all,  I have had PMR for about 3 years.  I am on Pred and down to 7mg for the second time.  Not feeling too bad still pretty tough to get going in the mornings but nothing too horrendous pain wise.  I have been referred to a Rheumy team and they have suggested I try Methotrexate.   I was given a leaftlet and told to have a think and come back to discuss.  My follow up appt was today and I said that I thought I would give it a go but then I got a lot more info about side effects etc and have come away pretty frightened.  Also it appears that I will be on both sets of drugs and all the other stuff that goes with it (stomach tabs, bone tabs etc) for a least 3 months in the first instance and then slowly, very slowly reduce the Pred.   On the face of it I don't see that I have got anything to gain and a lot more potential misery if I decide to go ahead.  I am sat here with the new drugs but I thought I would have a good long think and ask all you lovely people who have helped so much in the past what your experiences have been.   Hope to hear from you soon - good or bad.  Thanks for being there!!

My CPR was  28 and esr normal. They put me on 50 mg pred for 5 days - CRP stil high now 32, esr normal. They found I seemed to have gotten a pred induced disabetes, but did nothing about it.
Can diabetes make my CRP rise ?
After the new flare my pain is different. Now it is more of a sharp pain in the upper back, mostly over the right shoulderblade, and it comes and goes. Does this still sound like PMR or something else ? My stomace is also bad. I do worry about the whole thing,

"I was diagnosed with PMR in August 2014 (after never experiencing any form of serious pain in my life !!) and put on a dose of 15mg prednisone (which from previous posts is not much at all !!)
The dose was reduced by .5mg every 4weeks and I eventually finished with the steroids 3weeks ago.  My rheumatologist is happy with results of blood tests etc. and has confirmed I am in remission (at the moment) !!
However, I still suffer from a little stiffness in the morning on waking, not the same as the PMR stiffness but more joint pain (mainly in shoulder joints) and I notice my ankles and one knee now seem to swell a bit by the end of the day.
I work a full day and my job calls for quite a bit of walking up and down stairs etc.
From watching my diet I have recently lost a fair amount of weight which I gained as the result of the steroids.
The rheumatologist offered me painkillers but I declined as I thought the pain would quickly go completely.
My question is how long does it take for the joint pain to go ?
Many thanks, Lyn

"I didn't realize till I got PMR that my mother in law had it. I only knew that she was on prednisone and had all the rage symptoms. Until I got it my husband never really mentioned it. We live in different cities. Since my diagnosis I feel like a s##t for not taking the time like I do with my mom's health. She does have a daughter who lives in the same town who helps her.
I now am very concerned especially since both mom's over for dinner and mother in law tripped and fell and broke her femer. This was in August and has had a long recovery. She got home in November. Up until this very independent.
She had PMR for years which turned into rheumatoid arthritis and has been on methotrexate weekly which does agitate her. Lately she has had major pain down her legs and in her rumi appointment this week they say this is from osteoarthritis in her spine coming down her leg. So she now has rheumatoid in her body and osteoarthritis in the spine as well as recouping from her fever break so still has mobility issues.
She asked rumi what she could take for pain even acupuncture and he recommended nothing.

"Hi, just me AGAIN....WELL...i think i told you i had increased my tramadol from 100mg in the morning and 100mg at night to 200mg and 100mg...this got rid of the arthritis pain in both my feet and bits and pieces throughout my body but hadn't touched the pain i associate with PMR so i also increased my pred from 7mg to 10mg and although it isn't a huge increase it done the trick. I thought i'd better make an appt with GP to confess my self medication..!! I really wasn't looking forward to the reaction as feel i've been poo poo'd on my pain and stiffness by my regular GP who wanted to reduce the pred even though i was in pain and when i went to see another GP in the practice felt she wasn't helpful either but on my appointment yesterday she was surprisingly fabulous. I went in with my tail between my legs but before i could confess she told me she'd emailed rheumatology for advice on my 'normal' esr numbers...they advised i have a vit D and creatin kinase blood test but told her they were happy if she wanted to refer me, which she's going to...i'd also asked about alendronic acid the last time to which she couldn't tell me anything but yesterday she'd done her homework and advised me to take it and as long as i have a pint of milk a day i don't need to take calcium. SO then i got to my confession...expecting the worst...i told her about both increases to which she said ""i like to work together with my patients as you know your body and symptoms, i'm not sitting here waiting to get you into trouble"" she said if i was taking 10mg pred it was all the more important i take the alendronic acid...which i'm happy to do. So all in all a really positive appointment and i'll be happy to return for follow up appts with her. woooohoooo

"Hello, I was diagnosed with PMR by my Dr in Oct 2014. The only reason she came to the conclusion of PMR is because i had muscle soreness, but most importantly I mentioned that I occasionally get a sharp pain along my temple now and again and she was concerned about GCA. Obviously I want to feel better again, but the thought of taking steroids scares me. Because of this, I haven't taken them, but have instead taken Magnesium and Vit D, along with Devils Claw. I'm not in pain constantly, but I do feel stiff when getting up from a chair etc...
My concern about taking steroids is what damage would these drugs be doing to my body in the future ? I'm a 57 yr old woman, feeling old, where all my life I have looked and felt young.

"I've been feeling generally unwell with the odd chest infection, stress etc since October time. I've been hovering around the 20-22mg pred Mark during this time.
During January, my symptoms were slowly getting worse and I spent most afternoons sleeping or resting. Then I started getting pain in and behind my eyes, across my forehead and in the temples.
I rang my new rheumy's sec at St George's and told him what was going on. He said he would email rheumy and one of them would get back to me. Nothing! I rang again Friday morning and left message on voicemail. No return call.
By then, my hubby was getting in a state about me. I tend to be more laid back and don't want to make a fuss, - silly, yes I know!
So at 10am, we went to our local A & E where I was seen within 5 minutes even though there was a long waiting time. I saw a lovely doctor who spent time listening to me. He phoned the rheumatology consultant at St George's who is the boss of my rheumy there and had a long discussion with her about my treatment.
Although my ESR and CRP were normal, they gave me 60mg of pred, on top of the 25 I had already taken that morning.
By now, it was about 3.30PM and they decided I should be seen by an eye specialist, so the doctor wrote a letter and sent me to Moorfields Eye Hospital A & E in London.
Eventually got there and had various eye exams, bloods, including blood sugar levels, which were borderline and eventually saw a doctor. She founded nothing wrong.
We arrived home at 11pm! Long day.
I now gave an appointment with the senior rheumy at St George's tomorrow (again arranged via the A & E doctor).
Since yesterday, I've had no pain and am so full if energy that I almost feel normal. I can only imagine that the lower preds I was taking just weren't enough and I've been having low level flaring for a while, culminating in the eye/head pain.
I started methotrexate early January, so was also confused about any potential side effects from them, but I seem to cope ok with them.
Anyway, just goes to show that you don't necessarily need to have raised markers to have a flare.

"We all know that various moods, frustrations, depressions etc accompany living with pmr. We are all subject to different subjective pmr experiences however mind altering activity can be a helpful diversion though no cure. This activity can virtually include any activity that takes one's focus beyond this life altering malady....activity that absorbs one's positive and  spiritual energy. Constructive (sometimes uncomfortable) physical exercise helps to keep blood and oxygen moving through both aching and unaffected muscles. Ultimately most of us who try to live with the above within our daily lives seem to do better.
Online there is quite a bit about pmr & stress which is connected to our adrenal glands. check it. this then gets into more about how our bodies work and how our bodies and minds fall victim to the tribulations in life with stress being the trigger.
SO ASK YOURSELF, .IS STRESS CONNECTED MY PMR?   And do share your experience  . think good thoughts

"I have been taking pred since march last year starting on 20mg now down to 7mg. I have osteoarthritis in my knees and right hip and probably in my spine although I've not had it xrayed to confirm my suspicions. Since I decreased my pred to about 11 or 12mg my knee pain and back pain have returned with a vengeance. Last year when we went to Croatia when I was on about 14mg pred I felt great, no pain and was able to walk for hours despite having a broken rib! We go on holiday in may and I'm worried how I'll manage as I can barely walk at the moment. You might think that I'm mad to even consider this but I'm wondering if I should ask my GP if I could increase my pred for the week we're away and then go back to my normal dose as soon as we're home? I need to get off pred as soon as possible as it's had a really bad effect on my diabetes but I know it's going to be some time yet. My GP told me to expect to be on pred for 3 to 5 years. Idea's anyone?

"I am taking 8mg daily for PMR.   I was diagnosed recently with Atrial Tachycardia for which I am taking 150 mg twice daily.  Two days ago my doc increased the dose and take 75mg at 2.00 pm.  I had awful side effects before the increase, but now they have become very difficult to cope with.  He wants me to decrease the 75mg to 371/2 to see if that helps.  
This is really a question for Eileen as I believe she is on Propafenone for AF.  Did you have bad side effects when you first started.  I wonder if it worse because of being on steroids too.   If anyone else is also on both I would appreciate their input too.  I am seriously considering having an ablation because I cannot function like this.  But I am scared stiff of the thought of it.  
Anyone who can help me please ?

The reason I ask is that I have been successfully down to 7mg for a month or so now, but am definitely having a flare. It started in my Elbows yesterday but is now all over. I have had 3 Fractures in the last 6 months. The last one being a couple of weeks ago.
I know People say stress can cause it, well, this has been very stressful.
Also, I realise I will have to go up on the Pred, would it be
ok  to go back to 8 for a couple of weeks.

"I had an interesting experience during the 8 weeks I was untreated and misdiagnosed for PMR a year ago. I am a light drinker, but after 4 weeks of dibilating pain in more joints than not, I decided to go out on Cinco de Mayo (Mexican celebration) and try to numb my pain. From 6 pm to 10 pm I consumed the equilivant of 8 oz. of tequila, 4 straight, 4 in margaritas, with mexican food. Came home, still in pain, went to bed. Awoke @ 4 am, no longer significantly intoxicated, got up, and walked around with NO pain. The reduction in inflammation lasted till late the next afternoon. This temporary reduction in pain and inflammation pushed me to search harder for a remedy. I had lost hope. Please check my bio for additional info, if you like. I have since found additional data that  alcohol users have significntly reduced rates of Rheumatoid. I do not suggest alcohol as a remedy, but I have no idea what the mechanism was that supressed my inflammation. Could this be a path or clue to mitigation of PMR outside of prednisone?? Anyone have any similar experiences? Was it the alcohol, and or maybe the  agave (source plant for tequila)?? It was not drunkeness, there was a definite repression of inflammation. I did not try it again, as I don't like to drink that much. Lower doses (2-3 oz.) did not have the same effect. Thanks in advance, wish I had found this site during that time. Validating information here.

"First, background data which will give perspective:
I'm 65 year old white male living in East Central Florida.
Roadbike, ski, row shells, have generally worked out entire life pre PMR.
Had an undiagnosed full blown case of PMR when I was 52 yo, stimulated by a severe rotator cuff tear.Took 18 months, PMR symptoms went into remission.
At 63, Full Full blown PMR, stimulated by severe physlogical stress, 8 weeks undiagnosed, low dose prednisone gave good relief. started @15 mg, 18 months later, down to 3.5 mg, and for all purposes, feel as though PMR in complete remission.
I gained 40 pounds, during this second round of PMR, and 3 months ago, I felt that I was coming out of the clouds, the veil of illness lifted, and I began to work out and engage in the world again. I'm riding 20 miles per day road bike, feel great, have interest in women and life again. Swager returns. Lost 20 pounds in 3 months.
This is not a victory dance, and I give this information as a data point with these observations:
PMR is a momentus life changing event, and the fatigue and illness, coupled with the pain is dibilitating, even when treated effectively with prednisone. I can only say this by looking back at  how I felt and lived 4 months ago, and how I feel and live today. I had several doctors, including a rheumy say that pred cures PMR, I now say BULLSH*T!. At best, it remediates some of the symptoms to a certain degree, but the underlying inflammation is still present.
PMR is not just joints, muscles, pain and fatigue. It  affected my ENTIRE BODY and assorted and other effects on me. I developed an condition which I called ""old man phlem"" where I had to clear my throat frequently, which dissapeared when PMR remissed. I believe the entire chemistry of my body changed, I believe that PMR is a set of symptoms which accompany vascular and WHOLE body inflammation. I believe it is not a desease unto itself, a set of symptoms resulting from a severe inflamation of my entire body.
I found a rheumy who understood the struggle, most do not. Her support was more psycological than medical, as pred is the only effective treatment that I know.
At my last appointment with the rheumy who said that pred cured PMR, I did my best to discribe what I have said above...so perhaps she would not make the same errors. You can lead a horse to water....
I suppose what I want to say is that PMR is BIG. BIG, BIG.
 And most looked at me like I was a self indulgent faker. And I began to believe that too.
My remission over the last few months was as miraculous as the miracle I felt when I took my first dose of 15 mg of pred.
This in one man's view of PMR.  I write this for those of you that may find Validation in what I describe. I wish all of the best for you,  and hope for your remission!
I appreciate all of your  kind and patient entries on this site, and especially, Thank You, dear Eileen.

Long time since I was last on the site. My GCA is still hanging in there unfortunately - have been on pred. for 3 years now, my dose at the moment is 7,5 mg I also inject Mtx once a week - haven't had much success in getting my dose down and now my liver count isn't looking so good - I have been started on this biological treatment RoActemra a couple of weeks ago. Also an injection once a week. I had hoped that it would be instead of something, but at the moment it is as well as the other meds.
Is there anyone who can share experiences with this drug? It is supposed to be kinder to the body than pred. and mtx.

Not posted for a while as things have been going quite well for me. I am down to 3mgs of Pred a day, feeling in general good health, and I almost have my life back. However, as the title of my thread says, I am wondering if taking Pred can affect your hair.
My hair, although always a little on the fine side, has always looked quite good and never caused me much problem. But I have noticed the past few months or so my hair has become very thin and wispy and not looking good at all.
Could it be the Pred that is causing this? Has anyone else suffering from PMR had this problem?

"I've been on Pred for 4 weeks following a PMR diagnosis. My GP has been great. However, when I told him I've been on the 5-2 diet for 3 years and asked: ""does it have any effect on PMR"" he said very unconvincingly, No. Actually, I don't think he knows.
If you don't know about 5-2 it's called a diet. You restrict your calorie intake to 500/600 calories on 2 days per week. Apart from weight loss it has many other positive effects. My understanding is that this is due to suppression of IGF1, a growth hormone. IGF1, I've discovered, is also a cytokine receptor.
Eileen is a regular and very knowledgeable responder on PMR, so this is probably a question for her! My question is: given the role of cytokines in PMR, is it good or bad to have 2 days a week when a cytokine receptor like IGF1 is being suppressed?

"I have been diagnosed with PMR since May 2014. At that time I remember all body parts ached and I felt tired all the time. I also had muscle weakness in arms and legs. Went the  whole pred route, up and down.
In October I had a burst baker cyst in my L knee and had a cortisone shot. Now l. knee is stiff if I try to bend it too far but otherwise relatively ok. In December terrible sharp pain in r. knee, required a cortisone shot on New Years Eve ha ha. Settled things down for 2 weeks. Now pains are back. 
Rheum says I have RA. I don't ache anywhere else, at least not as bad as before. Little bit in shoulders, but I attribute that to rotator cuff tears (10 years dragon boating!) I am on 5 mg. pred and methotrexate. It's the knee that radiates pain all up and down leg. He won't give me the viscous shot or give me MRI because it won't make a difference. I doubt RA and I don't think PMR is an issue any more. Any other ideas?
BTW, this is playing havoc with my emotional state. I can no longer do those activities (cycling, snow shoeing) that are leg specific.

"I posted in the abdominal forum last week and got some responses, but I'm now swaying more towards this being bone related.
A brief summary:
I noticed that my abdomen looked somewhat distended, nothing too unusual because I get random bouts of bloating with my birth control. I stressed over it a little bit though as I worried that I was pregnant. I did two tests and they were both negative and the bloating seemed to go down for a little bit.
Fast forward a week and I am suddenly constipated, which is nothing new as I have IBS, but I started to worry that there was a connection and I was having cramps/pains too. I bought some magnesium based capsules that are supposed to cleanse your colon. Right after taking these I began having loose stools that seemed dark and I began panicking that I was bleeding. I went to my doctor and he did a blood test and a breath test for a stomach ulcer and I'm still waiting for those to come back. Since then I've still had loose stools (not AS loose as they were) but the stools have become lighter/a normal colour again so I'm not worried about any internal bleeding now.
The pain has continued. It has been every day and it starts on my left side, right below my bottom left rib and travels towards my naval, and is also in my back, right below my ribs and close to my spine. When I prod around my abdomen I don't FEEL any tenderness at all, really, but prodding at my bowels will prompt me to go to the bathroom sometimes. Of course I've been sat Googling everything and everywhere is telling me I have Ovarian-Colon-Pancreatic-Stomach cancer and I should be writing my will, but my symptoms were just not adding up. Today I've been experiencing pain higher up my left rib cage, closer to my breast.
That's when I found someone talking about costochondritis. They were saying that they were finally diagnosed with that after having severe abdominal pain for weeks and they were having diarrhea from prodding around at their abdomen and getting anxious about it.
Last year, at around the same time, I was repeatedly going to my doctor about abdominal and chest pains I was having (I couldn't even lift my arm) and I was finally diagnosed with a rotated rib cage. The pain went away when it began to get warmer. These pains I'm having now have only come about since the cold weather came in too, and I have been waking up with sore knees, hips and the joints in some of my fingers are also very sore. I decided to see if my pain lined up with the 'pain areas' for costochondria and I discovered that my left lower rib is suddenly very mobile and is very tender, and it doesn't actually seem to be my stomach or bowels that are where this pain is radiating from. I have already been diagnosed with hypermobility, TMJ and arthritis, so does this sound like it could be related or due to costochondria? Could the weather be causing these symptoms? If I sleep with two blankets on, making myself toasty in the night, I will wake up completely fine and the pain will get worse later in the day. The other day the weather was very nice and quite warm and I had next to no symptoms all day, and I have only right this second realised the possible connection.
Any one got any theories or advice here?

"I was thinking about PMR and although I am very nearly stable on 10 mg Prednisolone it is a knife edge dose. I still have many side effects from 4 years use of the steroid. In some kind of order they are:-
Muscle wastage, fatigue, lassitude, thinning of skin, easy bruising, cuts which take an unusually long time to heal, glaucoma, dry eye, exacerbated and premature cataracts which necessitated operations on both eyes to replace the lenses, virtual permanent stiffness and loss of motion in neck, constant shoulder and back pain, balance problems and now a recent discovery which I believe to be bronchiectasis. The last manifested itself with a slight productive cough I have had for about a year, with a shortness of breath which is steadily getting worse. Initial exam by GP showed no ‘crackle’, X-ray was ‘normal’ blood ‘normal’, whatever that is. Have seen this GP who gave me a course of amoxicillin (5 days) which did nothing. Then just left me to get on with things, no follow up, nothing. Not sure what to do next. I can see any one of the other doctors at this particular practice and am thinking to see one of them soon; well at least I can try for an appointment, currently 2 weeks!
 Now the latest manifestation…..Shingles. Or to give it its proper title
Herpes Varicella-Zoster.  A particularly painful affliction caused by the chicken pox I must have had as a child. It has affected the left side of my scalp, my left forehead, eye and face; I am not a pretty sight! By the time I knew what it was it was too late for any anti viral medication so will just have to let it take its course. Existing on Paracetamol, Codeine, Neurontin and the occasional Tramadol. All of these analgesics are for a short time only, don’t want to get hooked. Managed to see a doctor reasonably quickly about my eye who sent me to the eye unit at my local hospital, ophthalmologist examined the eye and gave me the all clear, phew!
 On top of all this I have the daddy of all flares I put the cause of this down to the trauma of my new affliction. My immune system is compromised due to the daily use of 10mg. Prednisolone which I have increased to 15 mg. for a short time. It appears that any kind of trauma either emotional or physical will set off a flare.
 I wondered what causes a flare in other sufferers from PMR/GCA and do they do as I do and increase the dosage of steroid and try to rest? Or is there a magical cure I should know about?
 Long ramble I know but strangely feel better for writing it, apologies if you think I’m wasting your time, or a hypochondriac. (I’m not).
 All the best and a rapid relief from your ills

"Please note ""?"" in the subject. I am not suggesting here anything, I just want to share what I have found and get your feedback.
EileenH started me thinking about this? Reading around the forum, it seems that it is the most common to take it in the morning. Due to extended day, I split my dose into two parts, one in early morning ( for me 8am) and one after dinner. But after hearing from EileenH that the actual peak in cytokines release is about 4am, made me question early morning dose. You see, pred takes about 2 hours to peak and it is only in the system 3-4 times longer before it is flushed out.  If we can optimally time our medication to the peak of cytokines release, then the dose ( theoretically) could be less then ""wasted"" miss-timed dose.
I found exploratory study that tried to answer those questions..  What is interesting is that the cytokines release ( fig 1) has two peaks; The highest one is at 4am, but there is a second peak at 9am.  This correlates pretty well with majority of recommendations suggesting taking preds early in the mornings.  I wonder if there is a better way to optimize timing ?  ..
I will tell you my thouths on this... I would like to split the dose and time it for both peaks.  How can that be done? Simple, take one dose before 2am that would be peaking at 4am and do another dose early in the morning, before 9am.  Note: I am already taking my preds in 2 parts... Main dose (now 7.5mg) is at 8am and I was taking second dose in the evening... I decided to experiment to delay second dose later and later.. Last night I took it just before 2am.... I call it ""pred sandwich "" [cool] .... Two cytokines peaks are placed between two doses of pred.
I would post the link to the web site where I found the study from Bristol, UK, but last time I posted  a link, my message never got approved. Please google for title ""Circadian variation in plasma IL-6 and the role of modified-release prednisone in polymyalgia rheumatica"". It was published in Future Medicine , .pdf format.
What do you guys think?

"I was meaning to try a 2mg dose of prednisone this afternoon, down from my recent, daily 3mg. 
Somehow I grabbed the wrong bottle, ended up taking two of the 5mg tabs instead.
So I am expecting great relief, from my mangeable level of symptoms that 3mg/day leaves me with.
I'm sort of kicking myself, but I'm also glad that it wasn't three 5mg tablets!
I will skip tomorrow's dose for sure, and will get in a good weight-lifting workout tonight, even though I did that just yesterday.  I hope that I can sleep normally tonight.
I'm sure that I'm not the only one who has done this(?).

"Hi all,
I have reduced my pred  dosage to 3mg, I visited my gp, and with the results of my blood test  she suggested that I reduce to 2.5mg and to stay on that dosage, she has put this dosage on repeat prescription, and is quite happy not to see me again on a regular basis, if I suspect a flare up is on its way I have to have a blood test straight away, then make an appointment  to see her.
My question is do stay on 2.5mg or do I try to reduce futher??.

He also mentioned methotrexate for the first time. Can anyone give me a heads up on this drug? What I have read online doesn't sound any better than prednisone! Thanks ahead for help, Ann11195

"I now take Rayos, but must receive from Pharmacy via mail.
I relied on pharmacy to refill and send to me automatically, well, they didn't and I didn't call them until Saturday. Monday is a darn holiday so delivery trucks may not deliver. (I know, people need days off, but when we rely on things for health reasons, I dislike holidays!)
So...I could potentially NOT have pills for Monday and maybe Tuesday night!
Should I take my old awful prednisone those nights?
The Rheumy PA switched me over so my mornings might be better.  That didn't change, but my acid reflux is 90% better from the delayed release Rayos Prednisone!!! Yea!!! Yippee!!!
I just fear taking the original prednisone at night. Previously I took with breakfast, but as said, Rayos taken at bedtime.

"Ive just been for an ultra sound as I'm having problems with my feet.
Originally I went to the podiatrist who said I had bunions, on one foot it had dislocated my toe and they could operate on them.  However I was referred to the othopeadics as they put on a pot after surgery, it was felt that because of my caring duties there was a possibility I might have my foot run over by the wheelchair.
The orthopedic surgeon didn't think My foot pain was being caused by bunions and I've had X-rays and today an ultra sound.   It's  all been a very slow progress as I had to have my gallbladder removed and therefore the proposed foot surgery and seeing the ortho guy was put on hold.
Back to today, whilst having the ultra sound I was asked if there was any family history of rheumatic in the family, I explained about the PMR and steroids.  He wouldn't tell me anything about my scan, so I'm left wondering, I've noticed posts on here about RA and as it didn't concern me haven't taken much notice of them.
Anyone  got any thoughts about my situation.?

I have been anemic for at least two years now--diagnosed with PMR in Jan. 2010, and on prednisone since then.
My primary care doctor and rheumy say that chronic inflammation can cause anemia, but it might be something else--pred can cause low blood iron, too....which is why I'm seeing a hematologist tomorrow.

"Hi all. Happy new year. I have been keeping up with all your posts but haven't posted for a while myself. I almost feel a fraud here as the docs say I don't have PMR.
On the recomemmendation of this group I requested a 2nd opinion. I asked to be referred to see Professor Bowman at The QE Birmingham.
Today was my big day. Well the Prof was lovely. He listened really well, gave me a good examination and is following up with loads more blood tests.
I was also treated to xrays on my chest, hands & feet.
Now the downside (again) he went over all my blood results from the last 9 months and said that every result pointed to PMR. But bbbiiggg BUT,
he doesn't feel he can say it is as I am too young! (44) I certainly don't feel to young when I am trying to get out of bed and get moving in a morning.
I have been on pred for few months now after begging my GP. Then refusing to leave the surgery until they listened. My GP agreed to a trial. Base line bloods for ESR & CRP 6 weeks on pred at 15 and then more bloods. Results were amazing and my bloods came back almost within the normal range. Good news my GP has since said I do need steroids.
I am now at 10mg a day but I feel it could do with being higher. Today Professor Bowman said he is really worried about me taking steroids. He agreed I needed them but is concerned about long term use and my age. I got moon face very quickly on pred and Prof commented that he could see pred was already making changes to me that he didn't like.
He wants me to come off pred using the dead slow method and wants me to start another drug.... Either Methotrexate or Azathioprine. I get tp choose.
So my lovely people have you had any experience of these drugs?
Which one would you choose?
I know a name for what I have isn't of too much importance but I was hoping to get a diagnosis today. Not sure how I will get on with holiday insurance etc.. Illness with no name..won't go down to well on the forms lol..

This week is 3 month on Pred for PMR and GCA. Down to 40 mg of pred from restarting at 60mg again in Dec..
So many symptoms have cleared up so that is good. I've been keeping daily drawings of improvements  to show the doctors.

My feet feel like mush can cause me to trip and fall alot. I have a stick shift car but I don't have enough strength to shift gears and use the clutch.
Just wondering if others have had this and if it goes away? I haven't been given to okay to exercise yet until after the  neurosurgery, pulmonary, cardiology, ophthalmology and rheumatology have review all the tests they did before the Holiday...so I will know more in the next few weeks if there are other issues?

"Can't find original discussion on this. I was diagnosed with PMR May 2014. Didn't know about taping, flares or this forum-neither did Doctor. Had flare in March 2015, hand pain only. So bad I couldn't use right hand and then it began to throb constantly. Fortunately I had found this forum and learned hand pain can be from PMR. I thought it was carpal tunnel. Throbbing stopped immediately and pain dramatically reduced within days of upping Pred. Thank you forum. As a note-another PMR patient said her PMR was gone in a year. However she had carpal tunnel surgery on both hands and back surgery. She never found this forum. I have since informed her/my doctor about Eileen's taping and forum website.
  Talked with two ladies who lived with PMR for years without being diagnosed so I am on a crusade to tell others about PMR. Most people have never heard about it.

I havent been here for a few months as Ive been told I have ""another myalgia"" yet to be diagnosed, but not rheumatica.  (Little pain but apalling weakness, I actually use a borrowed wheelchair sometimes to get round the kitchen.)
Im still on prednisolone only 4 mg a day (reduced from orig 20 mh with some difficulty but I am reluctant to increase it again because  (I think) it is starting to do my head in.   I have never taken hard drugs but imagine its rather like this - I start awake suddenly feeling I havent been breathing and am so out of focus mentally, just feel like Im still in a bad dream , Alien!  scary! gasping and with heart thumping.   The feeling goes away within 30 seconds perhaps,  but I am very short tempered my family say, no fun at all for them or me.
Is this an effect of the preds?  When I was first on them I felt like this,   but then for  months I did not.  It restarted just before Christmas on current low? dose.  
I am alone a lot, and really feel quite scared to go to sleep.  Would love to hear if anyone has any similar problem .

"My doctor decided to change my illness to Fibromyalgia. He thinks I did not respond to prednisone as he expected and suggested I use Tramadol for pain. Tramadol works very well for me, but I'm afraid to get addicted to it, I use it only sometimes or when I need to have more energy for some task or trips. I still think I have PMR, I have all symptoms you describe on this board, my pains are similar to yours, but my blood work is normal now. I could not tolerate prednisone when I was just diagnosed with PMR almost 2 years ago and I started taking Zyflamend™ Whole Body by New Chapter (it's based on Turmeric and other antiflammatory herbs). I think it help somewhat me with pain and inflammation. My question to you on this board if you were suggested by your doctor to take Tramadol for PMR and if did taken have you had any improvement by taking Tramadol.

"I was diagnosed with PMR back in December. The entire story is long and drawn out; however, suffice it to say that it is a far better result than initially expected. 
I have an appointment with a Rheumatologist later this month. 
Starting December 17th, my GP put me on prednisone to get me through the holidays. I was on 30mg for 5 days, stepped down to 20 for five, then 10 for five and now one every other day. 
I have to be honest, I have a high pain tolerance due to other medical issues I have had to deal with in the past. Two hip replacements, avascular necrosis in both knees and shoulders among other things. 
The prednisone has allowed me to resume a more normal schedule and get back in to normal activities. The problem I have is knowing the difference between pain from PMR and ""normal"" muscle soreness from increased exercise. 
My strength has returned, and I have resumed hiking and so forth. Still short hikes due to being out of shape. I went bowling last night for the first time in over a year. My legs are sore, feel like muscle soreness, but honestly that was where much of this started to begin with. 
I am trying to get me prednisone intake down as low as possible so don't want to increase just because. When I was reaching the end of 30, 20 and 10mg I started to get anxious and fidgety, which is highly unlike me so reduction was a welcome relief at each stage.
I am interested in what other people’s experience has been around soreness and differentiating between just plain old muscle soreness and PMR pain.
 Thanks,

i have been seeing a hand specialist for over a year . I had carpol tunnel surgery in August . It did nothing for my pain but seems to have added carpol tunnel to the left hand . I had an MRI on the hand last week and am getting an EMG on the hand next week. Has anyone else suffer from this ? My doctor says it's very odd ! I think the next step is opening up my forearm. I would appreciate anyone  sharing their experiences and recommendations on good sites to research.mthanks in advance .

"Hallo all.
I´m a Danish man, and ”only” 47 years old. I’ve just been diagnosed with PMR, by my GP, on the 23rd of December…”Marry x-mas!!
Had the pain moving around since the beginning of November, mostly hips, upper legs, shoulders, upper arms.
First of all, I really fell sorry for all of you senior citizens in here, PMR must be so hard, with less strength than during your younger days!
Luckely I’m fit and have a very high painthreshold, and I believe in getting my body and mind (Placebo Effect) in the best possible position before the “fight” begins. Unfortunately my vitamin B and D and zinc and testosteron levels are at the minimum levels. It would take my 2-3 months to increse all of these levels to normal. I’m willing to live with the pain during this period. I want to balance my body and mind first, before using Pred, and by doing this, I hope to decrease the time period of the disease.
Now my first question is:
Is there evidence that the time period before commencing with Pred, has an effect….
-on the duration of PMR?
-makes it more resistant?
-or makes the disease “bite in” or worse?
Prednisone has only been around since 1952. PMR has been around forever.
Second question:
Before Pred, during the past 10.000 years, did PMR also burn out after 1-4 years(of course with more constant pain)? My question is if Pred works mostly as a pain killer, and without Pred, the desease would burn out within the same timeperiod, by itself anyway?
I know a lot of you will write: “Just take the Pred now!”, but I’m asking for a qulified answer to my two questions. There is a 6 month waiting list to see a rheumatologist in Denmark!!
I have always worn glasses, and 5 years ago I was given Pred for 14 days. The normal 20 years aging process of my eyes, from being 40 to 60 years old, decrease rapidly within only those 14 days. It was irreversible, so I know Pred has a negative effect on my eyes.
All the best in the new year to all of you…..
Thanks…

"Christmas in my house is pure chaos starting early in December, due to a large family that includes 9 grandchildren. I shop, cook, purchase gifts for them. I also just retired, so have been dealing with all kinds of paperwork and annoying one step forward 2 steps back with insurance, etc. The last of the family left this past Sunday and I was just relaxing into my post Christmas calm (I was tired, but felt pretty good, despite it), when I got a phony phone call from what purported to be my health insurance company. They got some information from me (my health insurance number), before I realized that I was being scammed. I was extremely upset. There ensued a 2 1/2 hour phone call with my real insurance company to discuss this issue and also to get me onto their website, from which I was locked out for some strange reason. As I was talking to the IT person, I developed a migraine 'aura.' I used to get ocular migraines, but have not had an episode in 10 years. This aura (both eyes involved) was no different from those I used to have and it eventually faded. Differently from other times, it left me with a headache above the eyes and that now, 24 hours later, is still with me. I took Tylenol (Paracetamol) and it helped a little. The back of my neck is sore. Otherwise, I have not other 'head symptoms.' I am on 4 mg Prednisone for PMR.
So, is it just the stupid migraine or is it GCA? My vision is normal.

"Hi, I'm 37 and was diagnosed with PMR just under 4 weeks ago. I woke up quite sore all over but my arms and hands had seemed to be my main concern because I could not hold on to the steering wheel. After a week of tests my doctor put me on pred 50mg a day. It took about a week to kick in and after that we started to reduce it down to 40mg. With in two days I was in so much pain again. The doctor has since put me back up to 50mg but I have no signs of relief. I'm having problems with what I can do and should do? Example; Do I push through the pain just so I can get dinner ready. Then be in agony for hours on end? Because I can sit there for a day and do nothing and still be in pain. People are talking about exercise on this forum, can u give me some examples? My pain was mainly my arms hands and shoulders. Now it is my calves and feet when I walk. Is this normal? I'm feeling extremely useless. I have had to take time off work just so I can get this sorted and I have young children so I'm not coping well with not being able to some things. I try not to take pain medication if it's not needed but I just haven't had much relief at all. When the pain gets to bad I get quite aggitated and pain relief does not work. So to some it up, if I sit and do nothing I get throbbing pain all over that is bearable. When I do anything like pick up a cup of tea do dishes I get more pain for longer. If I cut chicken pick up a hevey pot. I'm in tears with pain and suffer for days.any kind of advice right now would be nice. Thanks

This great Doc diagnosed me within 2 mins and I took my first dose of pren this morning (15mg per day). Within 6 hours all my pain has vanished. Such a relief. I know I have to take it for 2 years but that doesn't bother me. I have tried to find out if it will affect my alcohol intake. I can find no advice anywhere. One pharmacist said none and I laughed another said in moderation. As Christmas is approaching guess i will take the second opinion. Is there anything natural I should be taking to help the cure. and also to prevent the Osteoperosis? All advice gratefully accepted.

"Hello - new here.  Today the consultant told me that we may be looking at polymyalgia when I described the pain I was in.  I'd originally been seen for anaemia symptoms but scopes & a CT scan haven't revealed anything very much.  However, the level of muscle pain I'm experiencing led the doctor to suggest this possibility.  Went off for more bloods - inflammatory markers and told to come back in 2 weeks.  In the meantime, to take 20 mg of prednisolene a day.
This seems to me to be pretty high when the consultant isn't sure until the blood results are back.  And, as I explained to him, I have quite severe pain in my abdo upper right and occasionally generalised pain in that area. He said that the tummy was another issue and didn't investigate.
I'm thinking of reducing the amount to 15 mg as I am worried about possible side effects when I don't know for certain if it is polymyalgia that I have and, especially, becuase I am worried about the abdo pain. Perhaps I should go to my GP to discuss these worries before making a unilateral decision?  Consultant won't be easy to contact before the 2 weeks is up - and, in fact, he did seem rather dismissive so would rather go down the GP route.
Any thoughts would be much appreciated.

"I was diagnosed with gout a month ago. The sites show conflicting info about what is allowed to eat and what is not. HELP! :
A - just eat a healthy whole foods diet, mostly vegetables - including potatoes/yams/whole grains
B - NO vegetables that GROW UNDERGROUND: potatoes/yams/carrots/onions/garlic 
These are vegetables I usually cook with, so I need to know: WHICH IS RIGHT?
C -NUTS/SEEDS - no, absolutely; this means I took all the seeds out of 2 cans of whole tomatoes in order to use the tomatoes as a base for soup
D - How much/if at all  can I trust the manufacturers of tomato ""sauce""/ ""paste""/ ""ketchup'? DO they actually remove seeds before grinding up the pulp? ARE THERE GROUND SEEDS in canned tomato products?   
E - How many seeds are TOO MUCH? Can I have a couple tablespoons of my 2 homemade relishes - green tomato, and red bell
pepper/cabbage? Both have celery and mustard seeds. Is it safe to remove seeds themselves and still eat foods that were cooked with seed-bearing vegetables in them? 
F - Earlier sites said NO cauliflower. Is that still the case? I often mix 1/2 potatoes and 1/2 cauliflower in ""mashed potatoes""  or in my potato-leek soups. (Leeks grow 1/2 underground. OK -or NOT? )  
G - whole grains - I read NO OATMEAL, NO whole CORN, ???
Is this still the case. Oatmeal, whole old fashioned, is one of my favorite winter breakfasts. And I like to add frozen whole corn or hominy to vegetable soups. How does this affect my usual whole wheat-high fiber breads?  
I am trying to learn how to put the gout diet on top of my type 2 diabetic diet (very well controlled)  but I need more guidance/experience from other gout patients. I stick with major medical sites and medical university sites - eg, Harvard U's site said that a whole foods/healthy/low meat diet is the goal - but that research was about 2005. What's the current recommendations?  
My local hospital has great classes for diabetics, none for gout patients. I need help to get this diet up and running - and I don't mean somebody else's printed out diet/menu plan! I will be glad of any current information you can give me.

"I know, it sounds rediculous! 
I went to to see a rheumatologist for the first time last week, 12 months exactly after my PMR diagnosis. I was in more pain and had more brain fog etc than ever, even though I was on 20mg of pred. I have to say I was more than a little skeptical when he told me to cut my pred dramatically (down to 15mg immediately and 10mg a week later).  I was also VERY skeptical about methotrexate (Eileen, you are partly responsible for this !lol). 
I was also put on Lyrica as he suspects I also have fibromyalgia (also skeptical lol - it's a wonder I believe anything any body says). 
I dont seem seem to have any real problems with the methotrexate,  although I think the Lyrica is knocking me about a bit. Head spins, tiredness, but my head is clear for the first time in 6 months! And the pain in my hips has almost completely disappeared - I could hardly walk last week and now I can move without thinking about it! I walked around the shops for three hours yesterday , and although I was worn out I was ok. 
this could be a case where the pred side effects were mimicking the disease itself. Something to watch out for?

"....those are the words I heard twice yesterday at my rheumatologist appointment.  Fills me with great joy - not. 
In in a nutshell.....yes I have PMR (no doubt in my kind whatsoever) BUT I am prednisone 'resistant'. So the 20mg I'm taking isn't working and it's partly because it's the pred itself that is making me feel worse - the stiffness and fatigue.... I take more because it's not working, and it in turn makes the symptoms worse. I may also habe fibromyalgia- something else to be thrilled about.  
Solution? Reduce the pred dramatically and see if the symptoms reduce and/or PMR symptoms return.  In the meantime take methotrexate and folic acid and Lyrica for the pain.  Seems that rheumies like this stuff! 
So I'm faced with taking methotrexate which will make me sick, reducing pred quickly, which will make me sick and PMR returning which will make me sick. 
The only joy in all this is I'm now officially off work for two months while it gets sorted.  That is a huge relief I have to say.

"Hi.
I'm a 51 year old (male, Cornwall). I was 'diagnosed' with PMR early August this year after at least 3 months of proper symptoms, but can trace back what I would reckon are underlying symtoms for a few years. I was immediately put on Pred 15mg, and the usual 'worked wonders' happened. I have had a steady reduction in dosage  down to 10mg, with a couple of hiccups.
Blood test results have been very good with (CRP?) level of under 1 (mg/L?) achieved this week. This partly due to heaps of green tea, fish, raw turmeric, garlic and ginger I believe (and 3 good sessions of swimming each week) .
I had been taking 10mg for a week (my 3rd attempt). but felt the pain creeping back across the shoulders and in my clavicle and a general malaise and depression clouding my spirit. I returned to 11mg  4 days ago and still am experiencing some heightened discomfort (has improved a bit, particularly after yesterdays swim, the first in a week after having my schedule interrupted).
A question I have at the moment is:
Is this common to have good blood test results indicating that inflammation has decreased significantly but to still experience a flare up of pain? Would I be better at eking (sp?) out the dose longer rather than trying to drop every month? I've had concflicting advice from GP's (I've now settled for one who seems to have a better understanding head on her shoulders).
I'm fairly stoical about the longevity of PMR and the long term use of Pred and am damned if it'll get the better of me, but am still in need of a lot of learning regarding how it manifests and truly what to expect over time and how I can join the dots where my health behaviour is connected to the PMR.

"Hi,  It is now over two and a half years since my PMR diagnosis and starting  the usual Pred. regime. I am now quite well on 3.0mg. and wondering as follows: 
Is there any evidence that staying on a very dose (eg. 2.5mg.), as opposed to reducing slowly (if possible) to zero, would actually be better?  In other words, could a very low "" maintenance"" dose stave off a recurrence? Maybe this is a daft question, sorry if it is.  Just thinking . . . . J

"Hello all. About seven months ago I started feeling weird ""things""in my legs which evolved fairly quickly into severe hip pain. Had X rays which showed ""normal wear and tear"". Pain then started in my shoulders which have always hurt so didn't notice it straight away until the pain stopped me working about a month ago. I now have pain in my knees, hips, shoulders and wrists. I have always been fit and sporty but feel like a 90 year old, I am 59 by the way. Went to a rhuemy who said it isn't arthritis ( which I'd thought myself any way). Gave me a shot of steroids, one in each shoulder, one in the rump. I was pain free for a week then it was back just as bad.My sister in California asked if in been tested for PMR, I'd never heard of it so started googling furiously. Reading about the symptoms, it was like i'd written it down. Went back to Dr who said he tested back in August but tests were ok. He's taken more blood and I'll get the results in the next couple of days. Is it bad that I'm hoping that it is PMR because if I get on Pred and can live without this constant pain and stiffness would be a great Christmas pressie.
Sorry about the length of this post but nobody here realises how bad this pain is but I have an inkling that you people do.
Regards Ron.

"Hi everybody! 
Seven years ago on December 13 I came off pred. I chose that day because it is very easy to remember as December 13 is the day of Lucia - the girl with candles in the hair brightening us in the dark and cold season. Well, there she was at the end of the tunnel waiting for me and ever since that day exactly 7 years ago I have been off pred and have not had any relapses. 
During the past week, the Nobel prize has been given to the Nobel prize winners and many of them stay until to-day December 13. We could read some years ago, one of the Nobel laureates was sleeping in the hotel room and he was awakened by a Lucia with attendants singing Lucia songs for him. Like many of the laureates, he was an old man and he thought he had come to heaven and the angels sang for him! 
After a few weeks of mostly rain, to-day we have 0 C and some sun shine. We don´t have the snow and the cold weather that we used to have when we grew up and celebrated Lucia. But now that I am 78, I am glad that we don´t have so much snow and cold days. 
Who is next to come out of the tunnel?` 
Lucia greetings

"I've noticed most here, once started on prednisone, have said the pain vanished.   Prior to starting prednisone I was in pain 24/7, particularly mornings.   Once on prednisone the pain did vanish, but only as long as I did nothing, the moment I actually used the areas affected the pain returned, always that night and in particular in the morning, the severety and spread of the pain increasing dependant on the amount of activity.   My wrists are always painful; however, after activity the pain gradually spreads first to my forearms, then elbows, upper arms, neck and then right side ribs at the back, dependant on how long I've been active.   Not classic areas for PMR I agree, but not unheard of.   I see a rheumatologist/immunologist for the first time in a couple of weeks so I'm still unsure if mine is PMR - I'd put money on it though as it's the only condition that ticks all the boxes!.    
Am I alone in only being pain free as long as I don't use the affected areas?

"Hi All! I've been plodding along quite well over the passed few months, reducing successfully to 8mg of pred! I get a little bit of stiffness in the mornings, but I whether it and walk it off. However over the passed few days I've been having stabbing pains in one of my thigh bones (femur) it's quite alarming as I've never experienced this story of feeling, not polymyalgia pain at all!! Has anyone else had the same??

"There seems some uncertainty as to what can cause terrible pain at the top of one arm in the middle of the night and when waking (it eases somewhat during the day)- does PMR usually take affect across the whole body? After 2 years of PMR this is a new development, and I think my good GP is a bit puzzled. More blood tests next week- but in England do puzzling 'cases' like me get referred on sometimes? I'd also like any insight into the pain not being uniform across my muscles any more- Thanks. Happy Christmas!

"Since being diagnosed with coeliac disease (ie intolerance of gluten in wheat, barley and rye), at the late age of 65 I thought I had the answer to my autoimmune aches and pain problems. I told my doctors to cross out any references to hypochondriac that they had in their previous notes!
At least, the doctors listened to me and gave me exhaustive blood tests when I developed the pain in neck, shoulders, hands and groin a few months ago and further tests confirmed the raised ESR.
This disease, unlike the others nearly made me feel like giving up but it is amazing what a difference a few days of steroid makes.
Coeliac disease is beaten by not eating gluten and that is well under control with the foods available these days and hopefully I will beat PMR in a couple of years.
From what I have read, late diagnosis of CD can lead to an increase of autoimmune problems later so I was wondering if there was a connection between them.
I'm still waiting for the Psoriasis cure though.

"As i have posted before, I am trying an alternative treatment (in addition to, not instead of pred) to help me through the lower dosages.  I've been getting low intensity light therapy (from a physiotherapist) for about three or four weeks.  My current dose of pred is the taper from 8 to 7.5.  This morning I felt so well, as pain free as I have been been since the initial euphoric month, that I decided to risk taking 7 instead of 7.5.  Fingers crossed (I know enough to go back up if tomorrow I feel regretful about this decision).  But I overall feel much better in myself.  Of course the light therapy isn't the only thing I am doing to improve my health and only time will tell if it has been a key player in my recovery.

"I was diagnosed with polymyalgia 3 weeks ago.  I took 20mg of Prednisilone for the first 2 weeks.  My symptoms stopped immediately and other than feeling like I've drunk 10 cups of coffee most of the time, I have been fine.  I've dropped to 15mg for week 3.  I have some 'irritation' around my hips and thighs, tingling sensations, not pain as such but I assume that reducing the steroids is important so should stick with 15mg and the weird sensations?
I also do wonder why people talk about the pain they have with polymyalgia because, surely, if you are on steroids at the right level there is no pain?

"Hi,
I've suffered from slight joint pain ever since I can recall.  Over last ten years it has progressively got worse until very painful in right knee, right elbow and getting worse in left knee, left elbow and wrists.  Occasionally everything flares up (last time around 5 years ago) and now.  This time fingers are very bad and all right arm is terrible (pain worse than right knee).
Blood tests prior to recent flare up revealed nothing and MRI scan on right knee revealled some arthiritus.  I have full mobility but pain is constant an now at times very sharp.  Doctors have told me off and said to do exercises.  Basically go away.  I'm 5ft 7 and around 10 stone so a very good weight/height ratio.
I have no swelling just stiffness, no deformatity, full mobility, plenty pain, no redness, no back pain, no hip pain and zero family history of arthiritus going back a long way.  To add to my problems, I've now got tingling/pain sensation over the last four weeks (getting worse and also just flared up) in my finger tips and thumbs and parts of my hand.  As I work in IT this would suggest  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome but its come on very quickly over last four weeks.  Never had it before. 
Today I can barely type.  Last week, I was fine!  Something seems very odd here and I can't find any symptoms on the internet that come close to my symptoms for arthirtis or other types of multiple joint pain.  Any thoughts would be really appreciated.

"Hello everyone! I am really hoping someone kind out there could shead some light or even comfort me a bit here. I am feeling a bit desperate now...
The story so far,and I'll try to keep it as short as poss:
I had a period of great stress in April, following a move into a new flat. within days my hands and ankles started to hurt to the point that I couldn't walk to the bathroom in the morning and hands felt like they'd been clenched all night (and still do). I had some severe cold sweats where my clothes would be soaked in minutes, severe sore throat and a thirst like i have never experienced in my life (I'm a 36 year old female from kent) and severe tiredness. I quit drinking alcohol and smoking and over about 2,5 months of rest the symptoms almost went away apart from the stiff hands and occasional fatigue and a shakey feeling where i need to lay down. 
Now 2 weeks ago a sore throat started after another period of stress and some alcohol and cigarettes (two nights out), the sore hands are worsening, my sore ankes are back, i have a severly sore throat with white spots on the back of my throat, severe fatigue and some thirst and itchyness around my eyes, but not as bad as before. 
My bloods have been taken over and over and I have had a CT scan and ultrasounds of my liver, pancreas, womb. It came back that I have some low level of inflamation in my bloods, elevated liver enzymes, high cholestrol and a small amount of fat on my liver and kidney stones.
I am a healthy weight, eat a very healthy diet and exercise moderately. I get sun and also take a vit d supplement along with folic acid (as i am trying to get pregnant for the first time), milk thistle, borage oil and a probiotic daily. I had glandular fever as a teenager, very badly and I also have a family history of auto-immune problems. Mum has mialitis of the spine, auntie (mums sister) fybromyalgia and nan has sjogrens syndrome and both nans have arthritis. 
If anyone can relate, shed some light or advise, I would be incredibly grateful. It's seriously getting me down.

Although short notice, if anyone either living in the area or close enough to travel would like to attend our PMR/GCA group Christmas buffet lunch on Tuesday, 1st December, please contact me as soon as possible.
Although we have quite a full list of members and their partners attending (47 in all), the Council who own our venue have just been in touch to say they have made an error with our booking and are moving us to a much larger room, hence I find I am able to accommodate more people, although up to a limit of course due to short notice for the caterer.
Our venue is Chertsey Hall, Heriot Road, Chertsey, Surrey, KT16 9DR. There is a public car park opposite the venue. Arrival/registration will start at 12 noon, with buffet lunch from 12.30pm, for which the cost is £6.00 a head for members and £8.00 a head for non-members. Lunch will be followed by a raffle and a quiz. Carriages at 3pm!!
If you would like to join us to share your experiences and gain support from others with PMR/GCA who understand, or simply to take you minds of this pesky condition for a few enjoyable hours, do get in touch with me asap by sending me a personal message (can't post the email address or this post will disappear for moderating) to register and reserve one of the few extra spaces available - you can be sure of a very warm welcome.

Was put onto 50mgms of Pred for 3 days then 25 mgms for 3 days then 12.5 mgms for 3 and now I am back at 10mgms. Whilst on the higher dose of Pred I felt great from the PMR point of view . Mind you watched TV all night due to pred insomnia.  Before the asthma episode I was managing Ok on the 10 mgms. I have given myself the 2 weeks to see if things would settle. 
I rested up during the 2 weeks and now decided it was time enough to resume my normal but PMR restricted life. Now that I am back at 10mgms I am struggling with the PMR. Thigh and shoulder pains, finger swelling. Some difficulty going up stairs and getting up from a sitting position.The asthma issue has resolved. A couple of questions. Could the Asthma episode have been the precursor to a PMR flare? Could it be because I came off the higher doses of steroids too soon? Do I up the dose of pred till,I get symptoms under control again. Your help would be appreciated.

"Hi all, I wrote on here a few weeks ago about having had a hip replacement in August. After the surgery I was on 10 mg prednisalone.  For the past four/five weeks I have been in terrible pain with the muscles in my leg I had surgery on.  I put my pred up to 10 mg then 11mg and it did get rid of the flare, but after about three days the pains came back. I up'd it to 15 mg and again the pains went away.  I was having physio on my leg so I asked the physio if it could be the surgery causing the problems and he said he didn't think so as the leg seemed to be progressing as it should. I then visited the consultant who performed my hip surgery and explained to him.  I also had X-rays and he checked them out and said it wasn't the hip causing the pain and that it was probably a flare of the pmr.  
In the last week I have had terrible pains again in the hips and knees. The problem is I am not seeing my Rheumy until January and I am very tempted to put my pred up a little bit more as it gets rid of the pains.  I am not keeping and am having night sweats.  I feel so miserable.  The pain goes away after I have taken the pred early hours of the morning but come back around 6.00 pm to 7.00pm every night.  Could anyone please give advice.

This time I sat with a GP who agreed with my request for the scan but then went on to aggressively insist that I agree to take the AA, saying to me ""YOU WILL BREAK BONES"", and ""YOU WILL GET OSTEOPOROSIS"".
This week I received news of my DEXA scan results, I was asked to telephone the surgery so that a GP could discuss it with me. This GP was quite sympathetic when I told her of my refusal to take AA. Even with this result, rightly or wrongly I told her, I am still against taking AA. These are the results she had given to me .  
   Spine total  L1,L2, L3, L4.   T score -2.3.   Z score 0.1      Osteopenia
     Hip Neck                         T score -2.6    Z score -0,5     Osteoporosis
     Hip total                          T score -2.4    Z score -0,6     Osteopenia
The interpretation being that I am Osteoporotic. The Hospital recommended AA.
However, this GP was more understanding, did not insist on my taking AA, but went on to suggest weight bearing exercise such as walking etc., also prescribed be chewable calcium tablets after I explained my past difficulties taking other forms of calcium tablets.
I would much appreciate all comments please, as of course I have to wonder if there is any possibility of my improving my condition, once I have 'hopefully' come off the steroids.

"My rheumatologist would like me to change from methyl prednisolone (medrol) to prednisone. I sense that he prefers prednisone because of availability of low dose pills.
I know that Eileen had trouble with medrol and improved greatly with prednisone and I wonder if others have experience with change?
I seem to be doing well at reducing my dosage of medrol - currently at 12mg a day. I wouldn't mind changing to prednisone if were comfortable that the change would not cause problems. 
For those who have made the change - was it done all at once? That is, did you change from (say) 12mg of medrol to 15mg prednisone? Or did you mix the two gradually until full change or what?
Eileen, have you done any research on this?

"I don’t mean just your name, but do they know exactly what has been going on in your ‘medical’ life since they last saw you ? Every appointment that you have (three to six months ?), they have several hundred other patients between your visits, all with different problems, and all changing their conditions and problems between these widely spaced visits. I don’t think they really remember in detail what is going on, since they first saw you, in precise adequate detail to do the very best for each patient.
Another example is your yearly physical (if you happen to have a yearly physical) – does your doctor do much more than the regular check and look at last year’s results unless you have a real medical problem they are regularly dealing with ? Usually that’s all they do, but they don’t look back to see how this is related to the last 10+ years which would show trends for future potential medical issues.
I never realized this until I ‘got’ this long term disease – PMR – all the other things I previously ‘got’ were kinda’ quickies, one shot issues, in relation to the years of medical need for PMR.
I honestly think that if I had not been lucky enough to have discovered and be ‘trained’ by “Patient” and all the great Forum brains, I would not have had the necessary knowledge and multi-person information to deal with PMR and get myself down to the drug (pred) level that I’m at by just going to my medical professionals.
An example that we all know, from the lack of patient information, is the high speed taper that many doctors/rheumatologists propose, because they seem to think that they had better ‘cure’ you right away or you will think they are not competent. So flare after flare is so common due to this attitude, and they often don’t record these in detail, until somehow the very slow taper is identified to be necessary, and how slow should it be ? – and I think that this determination is often via the patient’s information and not the doctor’s research into the patient’s records of the previous 2-3 years. Maybe I’m being a bit ‘tough’ on the docs but I think this is a common discussion point.
Anyway, what I do is to make my own medical history for each doctor in the form of a chart and give them a copy each time I go for an appointment to show what has been happening since I last saw them. It is very beneficial for PMR due to the changes that occur between medication dosage, blood test results and how I am actually feeling on a day to day basis – ache and pain wise.
My rheumatologist really likes it and finds it so much easier to make decisions and potential future medication plans and wants the format to be able use it for other patients that she has to allow her to really understand what has been happening throughout their consultation periods.
Likewise, a couple of other doctors that I go to, my urologist and GP, want the similar charts for the histories I make for the issues that they are dealing with.
Regardless of the way you keep your medical history, I think that it is very beneficial when going to a doctor appointment to have detailed information of your history that shows on one page or so what is going on in your medical life for the reason you are seeing them (including exactly how you have been feeling between appointments) and not to rely on your doctor reading back though years of thick paper files (in some cases electronic these days of computers) – which I’m sure they do not have time to do for each patient.
If anyone wants to see what I do for my PMR chart, send me a personal message and I’ll forward an example to you.

"Ultimately each of us makes the final decision about changing or not changing our dosage of prednisone. I want to learn how YOU decide.
For example, do you tolerate stiffness so long as it doesn't cause ""too much"" pain when getting out of bed? Or do you take enough prednisone that there is NO pain associated with standing up off the toilet?
What do you consider to be symptoms of ""too much"" prednisone?
Do you base your decision on laboratory measures in any way? 
Or do you simply follow your physician's orders?

"ok, I may be backing up a bit here. But I'm just so tired every day...
I've already mentioned all this before, but I haven't seen anyone say other meds really helped them besides the nasty but goody Prednisone.
Rheumy has me on Plaquenil (Hydroxchloroqine) and DMARD Sulfasalazine.  Said it takes 4-5 months to kick in, but the Sulfasalazine I think is making me SO tired!  Not take a nap tired, but brain tired.  Every day now.  I thought it was my thyroid, which maybe it is, I just switched to Armour, or I'm on Pred. 5 mg and holding, but still 75+% pain in mornings. But getting hard to function daily now.
What I'm asking is I know several folks here are on DMARDS, but has anyone heard it really helps PMR??? Pain that is. I don't know if I have any other RA, nothing comes up testwise. So I question is PMR really a rheumatoid condition? Or I feel I just developed bad Tendonitis and bursitis in all 8 places. Or did the serious inflammation create the Tendonitis and bursitis and is that RA?  And are we still concerned about it damaging our joints like RA does? Is that why I'm on all these other meds? 
Sorry I'm confused still. Maybe it's my brain having a set back, ha.

Hello everybody ! I have been reading with interest all comments. I find it very helpfull and conforting to know that I am not alone in suffering these horrible never experienced before pains...I am 87 years old, and this PMR hit me suddendly one morning, as I woke up. I could not get up,
and the pains were terrible. My arms, from the shoulders down to my finger tips. I never had to take pills or medicines before. So, I was quite active, even redocorate my bedroom, and cut the laurel edge araund the garden. I worked hard all my life. Now, this curse has got me !....I was taken to the hospital emergency, and there, they all were amazing. They plugged me on ECG,took temperature, blood pressure, blood samples...and told me I was going into the acute medical ward. They took me to have an x ray. Then to the bed. There, 3 doctors came around and asked lots of questions. I was then taken down to xrays where they took about 10 other xrays of my body, including one down my throat !....The next day I was put on 20gms Predisolone, and a Gastro bloker. and was given a LARGE....injection in my tummy...to prevent blood clotting.....I was allowed to come home because I have my husband and family taking care of me. I am now wanting to come off Predisolone, because I feel so unwell and unsteady. I walk with a stick, to prevent me falling. I was taken ill in July. From 20mgs of Pred. I have cut down to 6 this week. Am I cutting down too quiclky ? I am worryihg about cutting down, but want to get rid of Pred as soon as it is possible. Any suggestions please? I will be so very grateful. Thank you all and wish you to all get well. [/i]

"It turns out my fever and chills are not just a flu. Had my levels checked yesterday and got the dreaded call from the Rheumy today notifying me that they are sky high on 20 mg of Prednisone. He increased it to 50mg and have to recheck levels on Monday. Said without a doubt that because I haven't responded to 20mg I also have GCA but that a biopsy would probably be a false negative now because of the Prednisone. So here I sit frustrated and angry because if the first rhuemy in Sept had not brushed this off because of my age, who knows I mightened be a sufferer of both conditions today. Thank God for the wonderful Rheumy I have now. Even gave me his cell number because He is concerned. Now that's what I call service. Koodos to the Kaye Clinic in Edmonton.

"We all communicate so well on this great ‘Patient’ website and share our PMR miseries but I think that we should also be sharing more of our “happiness’s”.
There is a branch of medicine that addresses the state of mind influence on our physical health called psychoneuroimmunology. It deals with the influence of our emotional state such as stress and nervous system activities on our immune functions. Studies suggest that mental states such as stress can influence health and how subjective moods connect with the incredibly complicated physiology of the nervous and immune systems.
Many of us with PMR feel somewhat ‘separated’ from others (family and friends) who just don’t understand what we are feeling both mentally and physically.
I am sure that stress and loneliness push our immune responses in the wrong directions, shaping our ability to fight PMR disease. I think that the medical professionals that deal with PMR and similar diseases need to try to generate greater understanding of how the immune system and nervous system interact.
I think that “happiness therapy”, including regular doses of humor and specific ‘fun’ things that each of us personally enjoy should be one of the most important issues proposed by our medical professionals and not just how ‘rotten’ things are and will be.
Rheumatologists know that portions of the nervous system connect with immune-related organs and response to stress can suppress parts of the immune system and, over the long term, lead to damaging levels of inflammation. They know all about this from studying the immune molecular messengers such as the stress hormone cortisol and the immune messenger proteins called cytokines. But do they talk to us about this ?
Another ‘big’ factor is that lonely people who may be less likely to eat well or to visit their doctor regularly can have upregulated genes related to inflammatory response, whereas sociable people tend to generate the opposite.
Most of us are driven only by our own feelings, and our happiness depends only on our personal feelings. If these feelings are adverse, we may become very stressed. But if we care about things beyond ourselves — community, politics, etc. then stresses tend to be of less concern. There seems to be enough evidence to suggest that emotions contribute to health.
So – “Don't worry, be happy” and “Be sociable” are very important factors for all of us with PMR.

"I’m sure this has been discussed before, but I can’t find it.
I believe Prednisone has a fairly short lifespan in the body - half-life of around 3 to 4 hours.
My question is - if the drug is being absorbed by the system during that period, does drinking large quantities of water, coffee, etc. have any effect on the quantity of pred that is absorbed versus the amount that is “flushed” out ?
I drink a load of coffee and water in the morning and throughout the day (no alcohol ‘cos I take methotrexate !) and living in a warm to hot climate (Southern California), drink water all the time when outside working or walking so as not to dehydrate.
Any medical news on this topic ?
Thanks, Dave

My Gp reduced it again to 10 mg and all my symptoms have returned (although not as bad as they initialy were). I have been put back up to 15mg again, after three days on this dose I am still aching. Any and all advice much appreciated.
If anyone has any dietary advice that too would be appreciated

The tests have came back mostly ok...though my inflammation number is 16 and my albumin level is 34 which is JUST on the low side...i had a nosey online when i came home and one of the causes for low albumin can be chronic inflammation...i'd asked the doc if this could be anything to do with PMR and again he pretty much ignored me...it's as though he thinks PMR has no 'real' symptoms...he's now going to get more obscure blood tests (his words) and an ultrasound for my liver...sooooo fed up...!!

"I have been following the posts regarding Prednisone reduction and have used the dead slow method presented on this site to reduce from 5.25 to 4.5. It took me 3 months. Is my calculation or understanding incorrect and could I actually speed it up some? The reason I ask, is that my rheumy, whom I saw yesterday, wants me to go from 4.5 to 4 mg right away and reduce to 2 mg in the next 8 weeks. I am to see her again January 16 and be on 2 mg.
Using the very very slow method, I have not experienced a flare and would like to (obviously) continue to avoid one. December 6 is when I was diagnosed 2 years ago and put on 20 mg. Since then, my ESR has been normal on the doses I have been on.
The rheumy cited the various and sundry bad side effects of Prednisone. The worst side effect, so far, is that my skin is very thin and hair started to break/fall out about 1 month ago. She also brought up the issue of potential infection due to compromised immunity from Prednisone. My BP is normal, I have not gained weight, my cholesterol is still good.
So, the question is, is this slow method that I found on this site based on a 1 mg reduction or 1/2 mg reduction? What I mean is the old dose, for example 4.5 and the new dose 4 or would it be old dose 4.5 new dose 3.5??
1 day new dose, 6 days old dose
1 day new dose, 5 days old dose
1 day new dose, 4 days old dose
1 day new dose, 3 days old dose
1 day new dose, 2 days old dose

1 day old dose, 2 days new dose

"When I saw my rheumy last month, he told me that he would see if I could be referred to St George's Hospital in south London. The reason being that I have been unable to get below 20mg Pred without having a flare. I can't take methotrexate due to liver function. I've now been on between 40 and 20mg Pred since last December (having been at 40 three times during that time due to flares).
Apparently, St George's has much better funding than my local hospital and therefore access to more expensive drugs that may help me reduce the Preds. I've no idea what they may be, as I didn't ask the right questions at the time due to my surprise at the referral and feeling a bit unwell.
Anyway, I have an appointment on 18 November, so we'll see what happens.
I'm currently feeling quite unwell/having a flare perhaps. My daughter got married last Saturday and I also had my mother staying with us. She came over from Denmark. The wedding was wonderful, but the stress of the time leading up to it and then having my quite cranky mother here obviously took its toll. So, now I'm trying to relax and am back to sleeping for a couple of hours every afternoon.

Other question... I have also been on Methotrexate for 6 months. Now Dr wants me to try bio logics. I feel like I'm being over drugged and really would like to get off methotrexate. Seems to have had no effect in my ability to drop level of pred. When I was at 5 mg I felt like my pain was under control. All is about getting off the pred. Aren't the biologics equally dangerous?!

I decided to give it a try although I don't usually believe these, what I call, 'gimmicky' things.  And surprise surprise it works.  It's not miraculous, of course, but I think, given time, it will actually help my pains (hips, knees, ankles).  I've tried pain gels but had only slight to middling success.
If nothing else, it is totally relaxing.  Each pad goes on the pain areas for ten minutes, there are several levels.  I use it twice a day lying on my bed, so that is one hour of gentle massage per day.  That can't be bad, can it?

Naproxen - I am apparently taking this anti inflammotiry until I get the results of my gout
Omeprazole - This is to help any effects the Naproxen apparently may have on my gut
Amlodipine - this is for my blood pressure - before I started on predisilone 2 years ago I was taking 2.5mg of Ramipril but in the last 6 months my blood pressure is getting higher and higher to the point I am now on 10mgs of ramipril and my blood pressure is still high so the GP has put me on these tablets as well( rather worried that my blood pressure hasnt come down with just the ramipril especially as I am now only on 6.5mg of pred and looking to start a reduction down to 6mg - I use Eileens very slowly slowly approach and find it works for me)
I would be so grateful if anyone could advise me and I look forward to hearing from you

Now I am seeing posts about splitting doses, which I understand, I think, is for people who find a once a day dose doesn't quite see them through 24 hours.  Is that right?  The other idea, new to me, is dose skipping, where you completely miss a daily dose, as an attempt to accustom the body to less pred.  How many people have found that procedure helpful in getting their dosage down a little faster?  Or does it have no effect overall, or the opposite effect of triggering the return of symptoms?

"I am reducing from 81/2 to 8 mg pred.  Feels like I am having a permanent   panic attack.  Fast heartbeat, strong tingling in legs and feet, dizzy, stomach problems, restless, shaking, exhausted.    I have just been diagnosed with A-Fib and am waiting to go to fast track clinic next week, so worried about that too.  Is it the pred causing these symptoms of excess of adrenalin?  Also if Eileen reads this, can you give me some advice regarding the A-Fib please, as I remember you saying you have it.   Thank you

About a week later I had a server head ache. when to emergency, blood still ok CT scan no problem one doctor said it could be Temporal Arteritis but see your GP. I saw him the next he may be but not likey. I was put on anti infammatory and 292 for the pain and a prescription for prednisone 50mg more blood work next still ok. 5 days later the anti infammatory and 292 where not do any thing for start with prednisone GP then up to 60mg. 9 days later I started to cut back 55mg.

"I'm wondering how much sleep do you get?
Frustrated when the scientist or medical society say we should get or need atleast 8 hours a night. I've always functioned better with 6-7.  Now days I'm lucky to sleep 2-3 hours then get up to pee then 2 more hours, then up, then 2 more.  Sometimes I can't get back to sleep so I'm awake for 2 hours in middle of night.
I often wake from the new pain in my should blade area or the pain in my middle back. 
When I decide to get up for the day and try moving around, go for walk, then I get tired again. Yesterday was good day since I could go back to sleep after my pee breaks, so I was able to function more, but back to the ole ""did I do too much for my PMR to handle""?

"There has been quite a lot of discussion about pred being a risk factor for developing Type 2 diabetes. Another factor with pred is the weight gain. Both are, at least in part, due to the way pred changes how our bodies metabolise carbohydrates and store fat. One of the things I (and others on the forums) often say is that cutting the amount of carbohydrate in your diet will help avoid the risk of both (maybe not entirely but to a great extent) and, if you are unlucky enough to develop diabetes, will also help you manage your blood sugar levels better meaning you should need less medication and you may even find you don't need any at all.
Today there is an article in the Daily Mail about the same things I have been saying for some time. It isn't often I recommend health articles there but this is one worth reading. I'd give you the link but it might disappear so if you look online in the Daily Mail for this article under Health you should find it with no bother.

"Diagnosed Dec 2014 started on 20 mg pred and was reduced to 2.5 by the beginning of Oct 2015. I have complained for months about the pain but each time I complained because it was effecting mostly my wrists and hands both rheumy and GP diagnosed me with Fibromyalgia. For the last 3 weeks the pain has now gone back to my shoulders and is so bad I hardly sleep. Went to the Rheumy yesterday for 6 month check up and found that the blood test done in July my CRP wasup to seven which was an increase from previous tests. I dont know why my GP told me they were normal. Well I lost it. Told them to go on this site and rread up on some of the treatment plans in UK and to start listening to my symptoms. When the nurse said you dont get pains in your hands and feet with PMR I totally lost it to the piint of yelling at them. Sorry for the rant. The then proceeded to tell me that some people dont make it to zero and they are on Pred for the rest of their life at a low dose. After months of pain they put me back to 5mg for 3 months. Whats wrong with these doctors in Canada that you have to fight for everything. My questions are. Is 5mg enough and how long does it take to work and is a CRP of 7 very high. Joanne

"Thanks to everyone on this site.  I have only had one other post from a couple months ago, while I was waiting for a diagnosis. My old Rheumi was not a nice person and didn't think it was PMR.  He told me to get a second opinion so he would have someone to agree with him.  I did, liked her and switched Rheumis.  With new bloodwork she has confirmed it's PMR.  If PMR typically burns itself out after a couple years, have I served part of this sentence by white knuckling it for 21 months? That would be nice.

"I am quite desperate over my headaches. As I write I have a heated pad round my neck, as i feel that is where they emanate from, while lying under a fan in 31-degree heat.
I am on the slow pred reduction - moving really slowly and now going from 7 1/2 to 6mg while taking seven weeks to complete the reduction - after PMR diagnosis 16 months ago when I was started on 40mgs. Heaches have plagued me always, but never like this year when no medication makes any difference. Fearing a brain tumour, I have had referrals for MRIs of my brain and neck. The first was clear, the second showed age related wear and tear.
I have had deep rock heat massages of my neck, which initially helped but no longer make any difference. I go to yoga classes where I gently exercise my neck. Actually while doing the class, I seldom have a headache. I come home and it's back.
Do you think this is PMR related? Is it because of the pred reduction? I have struggled so hard to get my pred dosage down because of horrible side-effects, but even at 20 mgs a year ago I had the headaches so I am loath to increase the preds. On the days when I am on 71/2mgs there is no difference to my headaches from when on 6. Likewise when I was on 15 or 12 or 10 which suggests not related.
I am not sure if my general fatigue is PMR induced or just a side effect of the head and neck pain. Have hesitated to write this for months because I don't see how my whinging can help, but if any of you have advice or have dealt with similar problems I would love to hear from you.

"I wanted to post my question to Eileen on the open forum in case others are having this problem...and I have not seen this problem posted recently, particularly Eileen's answer (from 2 years ago!).
3 days ago I tried ""dry needling"" for my calves and feet because of tightness and pain. I. Had immediate relief, leaving my legs feeling a little ""sore"" like it would a day after yoga. At my last visit my rheumy mentioned that I may be borderline temporal arteritis and PMR. Also, for three weeks recently I had pulsating on the left side of my neck...that is now gone. I am 19 mnths into PMR, doing the slow taper, taking 7-1/2m
daily. Tried to taper to 7m but only lasted one week on the taper plan before the legs and feet became too much of any issue, together with arm pain. Is the prednisone treatment for PMR the same if I have GCA manfested in my legs but not my temples? Is Peripheal vascular disease and/or claudification a seperate issue, or part of the PMR/GCA?  Afraid of trying the taper again if it is GCA in my legs. My legs are better if I drop them over the sides at night...whch you indicated was typical of peripheral artery disease (?)...but I know the PMR issues are all over the place on any given day. I dont thnk I have explained this very well...sorry. Thank you for any thoughts or comments.

"I know it’s not something we all like to think about or talk about, but I have noticed that my “head” has changed a bit during the two years of my PMR. My mood and cognitive abilities seem to have changed during corticosteroid treatment with prednisone and I’m not sure if is it just because I’m getting “older” – or is it the drugs ?
Reading all kinds of different things in papers, books, etc., it appears that the neuropsychiatric effects of corticosteroids are very complicated, unpredictable, and can be severe and identified across many aspects of mental and social disorders.
There seems to be a commonly used term - ‘steroid psychosis’, which describes a variety of specific conditions related to the results of taking corticosteroids and these include mood changes, anxiety symptoms, cognitive impairments, and behavioral changes.
During the many appointments that I have had with my doctor and rheumatologist, the ‘mention’ or review of steroid psychosis doesn’t seem to have come up at all, until I brought it up as a ‘passing’ question of interest. And the response was “so what condition of the psychosis do you have and what are you concerned about”
Wow !! How do I know – apparently it’s not the job of the rheumatologist to pick that up this topic early in the doctor/patient relationship and investigate potential issues with appropriate questioning!
So who should we go and see to find out ?
So what should we do to improve our understanding of potential and active corticosteroid-induced effects ?
What is the result of taking prednisone and how do you know if is the prednisone causing the problems or is it just “getting old”. Most of us with PMR taking prednisone are not youngsters.
Eileen has already mentioned all kinds of abnormalities of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis - and I understand that these HPA issues can result in mood disorders – is that a common result of taking prednisone and is it described as steroid psychosis  ?
I think that one of the best ways to know what might be happening to your “head” is to ask family members – they are the ones who would notice the mood changes – and my not be ‘chicken’ to tell you about yourself ! I know that I have indeed had some ‘mental’ cognitive changes over the last few years and a bit of mood change when PMR things are not so good and although I see and feel these impacts, others have not wanted to mention any changes they have noticed, unless it ‘bothers’ them, I guess.
And again – is this aging or prednisone ?
I know most of us don’t like discussing how our “heads” are functioning, but I would like to hear other’s thoughts on this matter.
Thanks, (reasonably sane) Dave

"Most of my PMR/Pred based pain and stiffnes areas have been upper legs hips, back, neck. I have somewhat learned to deal with them other than the differential diagnosis problem with the spinal stenosis making it difficult to know what you are treating. In this case I have started a knee problem on the right side which comes on at night and now needs therapy at night such as heat or ice pack to get back to sleep. I'm looking for experiences with knees to separate a real joint problem from good old PMR or overuse and of course old age, which includes me trying to stay on the tennis court until they carry me off.

"I'm trying to survey those who have lost weight since their pmr symptoms began.
Did weight loss occur before or after beginning treatment with corticosteroids such as prednisone?
Are there any differences in your condition from what you feel is the norm for patients here?
My own 10Kg weight loss seems to have all occurred in the 3.5 months before my treatment started at 15mg pred, at age 54. 
I had tapered to 5mg in just under 10 months, but I have been at this 5-6mg sticking point for the 8 months since I got down to 5mg, with symptoms now limited to my chest/ribs/collarbone region for at least 5 months now.
I have remained relatively active throughout, but had really slowed and with severe symptoms before treatment bagan.
My much-reduced weight has been extremely stable for over a year now.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in December, 2015 and started on 40 mg prednisone which rapidly tapered to 20 over two weeks.  The pain resolved rapidly, miraculously.  My ESR went from >100 to 30 in a week and CRP from 7.5 to 2.3.  In the following months I continued to taper but whenenver I drop below 7 mg of pred I have a flare.  My ESR and CRP have stayed very slightly elevated with minimal increases during flares.  This summer my Rheumatologist recommended trying Methotrexate to which I reluctantly agreed.  After four months, my ESR and CRP have actually increased significantly and for the first time my kidney function is slightly decreased.  (I was at 6 mg pred but increased after the labs to 10 mg.)  I will be going off of Methotrexate--thank God:  It made me sick for a couple of days every week--but I don't know what other concoction will be suggested next.  My labs for RA have been negative, but I do have some joint pain and swelling.
The week before my last labs, I was under a great deal of stress.  Could that have contributed to the bump up in both CRP and ESR?  I had an illogical hope that I would be well in a year but no such luck.  This is my first year of retirement and while I appreciate not having to go to work, being this sick is a bummer.  
And if being sick isn't bad enough, as a citizen of the US, I have to listen to the crazy ^%$#&^ Republican presidential candidates day in and day out

"For those who have ""successfully"" weaned down to 8mg of medrol a day - or so - what levels of pain/stiffness, low energy, chipmunk cheeks, belly fat, etc. are you tolerating? I realize that it's difficult to give an objective measure of any of those symptoms. Any attempt at describing the levels would be helpful.
I began medrol 9 weeks ago. At the initial 20mg per day my first few days were heavenly.  Absolutely no pain/stiffness, there was abundant energy, marvelous attitude. Then things gradually got worse. I especially noticed lowered energy levels and even much lower endurance level for aerobic exercise. Pain/stiffness, although increased, was not at all bad. As I have tried to lower the dosage, pain/stiffness has increased but is still not limiting my ordinary activities. I have developed the chipmunk cheeks and a round belly. I am on the verge of lowering dosage to 16mg.
I would really appreciate hearing others' experiences from this level onward. Again, are you having to tolerate difficulties in order to lower dosage? And what sort and level of difficulties? Is there any improvement of energy and endurance?

"My pain from PMR seems to be under control with 6mg pred/day and this would appear to be my 'ongoing control dose'.  However when I have no pain i am tempted to exercise and in particular play table tennis.  This probably not surprisingly results in a flare up with painful hands and wrists. Are these flareups indicative of permanent damage and therefore should I now give up table tennis until i have a cure from PMR.

"I mentioned this problem a few months ago but it is becoming an even more serious issue.  I've been on Pred for PMR for over 2 years and over the last 6 months an issue has emerged with my left leg.  During that time stiffness in the left inner thigh and buttocks has progressed now to where I have discomfort most of the time just walking on it.  I get a sense of strain in the inner thigh and sometimes on the outer thigh, often with some pain with most steps I take.  I'd almost use the word 'unstable' to describe the condition.  A recent x-ray showed the left hip to be normal.  I'm now finding it difficult just going from room to room.  My doctor says Pred weakens muscles and possibly this is the case.  I wonder if doing light daily stretches has strained or torn a muscle or if this just another problem resulting from being on Pred.  I'd welcome any thoughts you have or experiences like this.  Is my rheumatologist the best person to determine what is the cause and if anything can be done to treat it?  Is  there another specialist better trained in this area that I should speak to?

"I've been diagnosed with PMR, after floundering around for answers for the pain that suddenly came on a year ago.  Prednizone suprisingly was the clue as I had poison ivy and took it and all symptoms disappeared.  Just recently had to go off it again and symptoms all returned.  I've tried to educate myself on this by reading forums, online texts, the links on this group, and alot that Eileen has posted.  My rheumatologist wanted to start me on 10 mg of prednizone but I insisted on 5 which put the pain ""in the background"".  It did not appear to do enough of the trick so now I am just today upping it to 10 mg.  I note that most recommendations suggest 15 mg of prednizone but I really worry about weight gain as I am so hungry just on 5 of pred.  The pain disappeared on 30 mg (for poison ivy) but that seems way too high.  I hate having to experiment like this.  Is there a good book I should read?  I see my rheumy in two weeks for new blood tests but I want to be well prepared.  By the way, I also have hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, and osteoarthritis.  I try to stick to the Paleo diet but still am gaining weight. I was so active before and I hope to get back to running and mountain climbing.  Gave up weight lifting after 30 years!  I'm 63 and refuse to let this stop me!  Thanks for any input and help!  I love finally getting some answers.

"my very astute GP suggested that since I didn't like statins based on my risk factors I should take some tests. I didn't have symptoms but outcome has been a coronary stent to unblock an artery. In my mind the difference between ""public health"" and ""individual health"".
I've found (even though it was never lost) a 2014 paper that suggests a 2.5 times greater risk of vascular events (heart / stroke) in patients with PMR than normal. Keele University paper using the UK General Practice Research Database. I guess its easy to find anything on the internet to support one's beliefs. So I'm wary. The suggestion of increased risk is consistent with my simple perception that I exercise much less than I did without PMR and lack of exercise is accepted as increasing the coronary risk. My simplistic interpretation of the conclusions in the paper is that the inflammation plays a role.
Something about the way the statistics have been exposed in the paper caught my attention in a way the statistics used for coronary risk factors in general didn't. Perhaps the tightness in the connection between the statistics and the narrative, I could follow and reproduce the argument. Even a chart that included the 95% confidence limits (my industrial experience says I need those limits). The equivalent chart for the general coronary risk factors (age, cholesterol, smoking, etc) has eluded me which contributed to my scepticism.
The coronary rehab is excellent. While the staff are allowing for the PMR there's seemingly nothing explicit in any of the materials (principally of Heart Foundation origin) that relate to any uncontrollables apart from diabetes. Very difficult of course with a group where everyone probably has different complications.
Of course resolving my conflict between ""exercise reduces risk of heart attack"" and ""exercise increases PMR pain"" and ""pred side effects reduce my effectiveness and are unhealthy"" and ""inflammation is bad"" is an interesting challenge. One that we all face in various ways. I have a feeling of more than one rock and many hard places to choose from. :-)
Some days I wish it would all go away, but the wishing well is dry so I just have to get on with it and remain positive. So far so good. And knowledge is power - even if I did gather it after my ""coronary event"".

"Some time ago my GP diagnosed me with PMR which affected my wrists, forearms, elbows, upper arms and neck so he put me on 15 mgs of Prednisone.   The Prednisone didn’t help with the pain so my GP revised his diagnosis and started tapering my dose down and gave me a referral to a Rheumatologist to see what the problem was, I don’t see the specialist until Xmas.
I was tapering by 1.25mgs per week without problems; however, my GP said that was too slow and advised a steeper taper of 2.5mgs, which I followed.   A day or so later the pain in my forearms was so intense I was up for 4 hours with heat packs trying to manage the pain.   Eventually my wife took me to emergency and the on duty Doctor upped my dosage to 25 (no treatment for the immediate pain though).   Next day the pain in my forearms, elbows, upper arms and neck had gone, only the pain in my wrists remained. 
I remained on 25mgs for a week and as advised started tapering down again.   I’m now on 20mgs with no pain in forearms, elbows, upper arms or neck but still have pain in my wrists so I’m wondering if I should have upped my dose to 30mgs to see if the wrist pain improves or should I have stayed at 25mgs for longer.
By the time I see the Rheumatologist (7 weeks) I’ll be taking a much lower dosage and presumably will still have wrist pain.   What I’m dreading is the Rheumatologist upping the Prednisone to a level to alleviate my wrist pain and then start tapering again.
I’m concerned because I have now developed Uticaria, there is a link between PMR and Uticaria so I'm assuming the Uticaria is most probably as a a result of PMR or Prednisone, so the longer I’m on Prednisone presumably the longer I will be scratching all night instead of sleeping.
Any suggestions?

"I'm into PMR for about 14 months now, and started reducing from 20 mg almost immediately.  I'm now at 8, going down to 7 and am struggling.  I'm wondering, if the average timespan for PMR to""burn itself out"" is 2 years, why we should start decreasing dosages prior to this time?  Should we simply hold at 10 mg for 2 years and then start decreasing?

"Hi. Thanks for all the helpful advice on this forum.
I was diagnosed in March 2014 after a huge flare that left me unable to get dressed unaided or bend down etc. I have gradually reduced using the dead slow method. Pain and aches returned when down to 3mg now I am on 1mg working down to zero but pain in arms and legs is continuous unless I take neurofen (no other painkiller works at all.) I am unsure whether to continue Predisolone reduction owing to the increasing pain.
So my dilemma is do I carry on down to zero, take 2 neurofen in mornings (which seems to clear the pain for rest of day) or go back to 3mg where I will be comfortable. The complication is I was diagnosed with osteopenia 3 months ago (after bone scan) so am keen to rebuild bone density without steroids. Also I previously had early morning PMR symptoms for 10 years from the age of 48, so was expecting that aches would go away by midday – this has not happened.
I read this on this forum yesterday, ‘untreated inflammation is very dangerous. It damages cells whether they are muscle or  vein or arterial and many of these cells once damaged can never be revived or replaced hence the excruciating pain we are in when not taking steroids.’
Any comments would be gratefully appreciated.

"I was diagnosed PMR last Fall.   I was so bad I had to fall out of bed and roll just to get up.  Up untill then, I was a dancer, outdoors person.  Hiker, camper, kayak etcc...   I was on prednisone.  My weight ballooned.  I moved on to Celebrex.  My weight continued to go up.   I chose to go off the meds.  I want to lose weight.  However all I want to do is lay on the couch all day because I am in to much pain to do anything.  Walking is the only relief I have.     Does anybody have any recommendations of Natural remedies I can take?     I have been taking Jameson Body Guard but I still need Alieve to go with it.    Now I am not only in pain, but fat and depressed too.

"Hi. Just to cheer up all of you who are struggling, very slowly, to reduce your Pred. and even wondering if it's worth it all.  It is. Two years ago I started on 20mg. and have been reducing since using Eileen's method. It worked really well for me and am now at the 3.5 to 3.0 stage. I don't know if I'll be successful in stopping completely - in my head I've always felt that 2.5 was a really nice dose to be at (daft, I know) for another year - but we'll see.
I just want to outline the improvements I've noticed now that I've reached a low dose:
1) Hair -  has improved, much less thin.
2) Eyes - wavey, blurry episodes have stopped
3) Skin - improved, much less paper-thin looking
4) Depression - early morning for 2 hours has stopped
5) Fatigue - much less tired
6) Peeing - no getting up at nights now
7) ' Pred. brain' almost gone ( just old age now) 
So please see - it'l be worth it in the end. I feel that, even if the PMR returns later on (much later, hopefully), I'll be so much better able to manage it, thanks to Eileen and the other experts (you know who you are) who have been my education and support and were invaluable. Thank you all.
Keep up the hard work. J

"History:
About a year ago I began to have severe (mostly) lower back pain. It felt very much like spasms that I had experienced occasionally for many years. (I am 81 years of age.) But my previous experience was that resting, then activity, perhaps with massage, the spasms would go away and I could resume normal activity. I am normally a physically fit and active person.
The usual approach did not work. The pain increased. I was treated by a chiropractor, physical therapist, massage therapist, acupuncturist, and spoke many times with my primary care doctor over several months. By experimentation I found that there were trigger points that, when acupuncture needles or massage worked specifically on those spots, the pain was abolished, sometimes for days. I researched trigger points and my condition seemed to fit exactly the description. But then, trigger point treatment failed entirely to relieve the pain and I began the classic symptoms of PMR (although I only discovered a description of PMR after another several weeks).
When I proposed to my doctor that I might have PMR he prescribed a Medrol pack that worked immediately to completely relieve my pain. And after only two days of the six day regimen I felt like a 20 year old. But the pain returned one day after the six day regimen ended. So, after a few tests, he prescribed 16 mg medrol spread over the day. Again, the effect was immediate, and I felt wonderful. The morning pain/stiffness was not totally gone, although greatly relieved, so I increased the dosage to 20mg spread over the day.
For the next thirty days I was essentially pain and stiffness free but the 20 years of age feeling decreased. I was, finally, able to get an appointment with a rheumatologist who declared that my PMR was atypical since my lower back pain was accompanied by very few upper back or neck pains and my sed rate and other rheumatoid signs were missing. He directed me to reduce my daily dosage to 16mg. My back pain was only a little more pronounced in the mornings, but I felt very unwell and began to be short of breath with very little exertion. I also began to experience numbness in my hands, some anxiety, heart rate sometimes over 100bpm when not engaging in any activity. Then, when my BP spiked to 200/120 or so I visited the local ER. (My rheumo had gone on vacation without having provided a covering physician.) After several hours in the ER my vitals returned to normal and I was released. I decided to increase my medrol to 18mg a day. I am now reasonably stable but still unable to exert myself very much. I also still have have periods of numb hands. The feeling of unwellness is common. (Another interesting side effect that I have experienced since medrol is slow weight loss unless I eat more than usual.)
Forgive the lengthy history, but I would be interested in hearing from anyone with any similar experiences. Especially any recommendations about fitness,

I have a flare up which puts me back for the whole winter.  Last year I had a terrible time with my arms,wrists and hands (took me months to sort) and it has just started again after arriving home from Cyprus last Sunday, but the one question I have is has it ever affected anyone in the foot as I am having pain just above my 2nd, 3rd and 4th toe and the top of my foot is swollen, can hardly put my foot down. I have had an xray yesterday but it feels like the pain I get in my hands which my Specialist says is pmr and my hand swells the same. My GP says it is not pmr but could be a stress fracture.

"Hi All,
I have had thyroid failure for the last 24 years and been on a steady dose of thyroxine. I have had a few ups and downs and had to take beta blockers for some time to stop shaking. I have been taking anti depressants for the last three years as I couldn't cope with that and menopause, but have been on HRT for the last year and a half as well. It has taken some time to find out I have PMR as well as I thought the pain in shoulders and arms was frozen shoulder which I had previously and the doctor thought my exhaustion was due to the depression, although I am not depressed now!
Does anyone else have PMR and thyroid problems? My thyroid level has shot up, I have a fast heart rate and am shaking again. My doctor phoned today to tell me to cut the thyroxine dose at once. My thyroid level has been high since before I realised I had PMR (I remembered my Dad had it) and the Dr put me on 10mg pred. It hasn't come down despite cutting the dose at the same time as starting pred. I had two good weeks after the pain went away, then started to shake and feel worse again.
I don't get to see a specialist until February and my Drs don't seem to know much (5 of them couldn't diagnose it as my ESR rate is normal) so any insights would be helpful.

"I have gradually been tapering my dose of prednisone and got down to 13mg. At this level, I began to get a return to sympoms, mainly in my legs, with sore knees. In particular, they feel very tight behind the knees. I have had this before when I started PMR. When I was on 15mg a couple of months ago I was fine - almost pain and stiffness free and was able to do nearly all my usual physical activities. I put my dose back up to 15 three days ago and symptoms seem to be reducing slowly although not as much as before. My queston is when symptoms begin to return, how much does one increase the dose? I am sure if I went up to 20mg they would go completely, but then I have to start tapering all over again. Does my situation mean that I need around 15mg to keep my symtoms under control? When I started PMR about 7 months ago I did seem to need a high dose - I was started on 40mg and even at 20 I had quite bad symptoms for a while until things settled down. I had rather hoped that PMR gradually burned itself out and so one needs less and less pred to manage symtoms but it seems that although general trend is gradually downwards, symtoms can return at any time, even when pred dose remains the same. Disappointing. And, is it better to keep at lower dose of pred and suffer some symtoms or increase dose (in my case from 13 to say 17) and have far fewer symptoms?

"I've seen a lot of comments the past few days regarding dose splitting as a way to manage PMR pain or pred reactions.  So far I haven't felt the need, but I do have a question.  Is dose splitting likely to cause any changes in the way the body eventually starts to produce its own cortisol again when reducing pred to low doses?  Have any studies been done to show whether the practise is beneficial, neutral,or possibly likely to keep the adrenals supressed longer?

"I haven't been on this PMR website for a long time. But it has taken a PCP, Endocrinologist, ' Orthopaedics, Nueurologist and finally a new Rheumatologist to give me a diagnosis of PMR. I've had X-rays , numerous blood tests and of course an mri of my torn rotator cuff to come to this conclusion! The torn rotator cuff was what started the whole stiff painful body aches. My rheumatologist said that it wasn't unusual for something like the cuff tear to trigger it, I am on only 10 mgs of prednisone right now and it has helped. Instead of my usual dancing type aroebics I now do a stretch type exercise that I bought on DVDs. It seems to help , I hope I continue to feel better. I wish the same to the rest of you who have this painful condition!

About 1 month ago my hands started swelling and I can hardly make a fist until 8-12 hours after my daily dose of Predisone

Each drop resulted in a worsening of whatever it is I've got (pain in wrists, forearms, elbows, shoulder, neck and ribs at the back)., I came down with a rash on torso around this time but GP advised it wasn't connected to prednisone and told me to decrease dose in 2.5 mg steps which I did. Next day I was woken at 1:00 am by excrutiating pain in both forearms, applied hot compresses and pain gradually abated.

I've been treated for PMR for several months now and down to 7 mg prednisone.  I started a year and a half ago and responded to the prednisone but started to be symptomatic as around 7 mg and the rheumy decided it couldn't be PMR. He decided I had fibromyalgia which made no sense at all!  I argued, but he wouldn't listen and took me completely off prednisone. After months of considerable pain and suffering with nothing to help but naproxin, I changed rheumatologists. I could barely walk when I went to the new rheumy and fortunately she got it right and I'm on my way.
I am miserable that I cannot get going on housework or anything else without just being entirely wiped out!  I get depressed because of this or maybe I am depressed and then get fatigued?  Not sure about much anymore.

"I have been diagnosed with Osteopenia. I am coming up to 70 and have had PMR for 3 years. I have just discovered that I have suffered two fractures of the spine, so after 3 years of pred, and at least another to look forward to , the Osteoporosis Nurse thinks I ought to have treatment. I gather the Zoledronic Acid is an annual drip and Denosumab is a bi-annual injection. I have looked at the chemical structure of these and find that Denosumab is mono-clonal, which makes me lean toward it as I feel there may be fewer side effects. I would be grateful to hear of other peoples experiences of these.

"Second attempt at reducing, 8 days in and the pains are back. I feel I'm almost back to where I started. Stiffness on waking, ankles, wrists and lower back is just ouch. I'm so fed up this morning. I don't want to go back up to 30mg again, the palpatations were too much to cope with. My other half says I'm doing too much. He's probably right. No he IS right. If I really slow down and stay on 25mg will it subside?

"So I wrote a thread awhile ago in which the dr was reducing my prednisone even though my SED rate was going up.  Well, I decided to try his way and reduced this past month down to 12.5.  My inflammation rate went up 6 points, from 45 to 51.  I'm in constant pain which is not relieved by my pain pills very much.  Today when he saw the 51 result he muttered, ""Am I missing something?""  Because he had been trying to get me to believe I was having fibro problems, which I didn't believe, because I've had fibro for years and it never felt like this!  So anyway, he's still too worried to let me go up on the pred. and is starting me on a chemo type drug called methotrexlene (sp?).  Anybody else take that?  Know what I did when I came home today?  I took an extra 5mg of pred just to spite him! hahahaha.

"I've had PMR since March 2015 and started at 20 mg. since then, I've reduced to 7mg starting 2 1/2 weeks ago. Everything was going great until I made a misake with my dosing and put 1 mg pill in my pill box as opposed to a 5 mg pill! For three days I didn't realize it and I got severe pain in my wrists and it started to come back in my shoulders and thighs. When I realized what I had done, I went back to the 5 mg pill (plus 2 one mg pills). Since then I wake up and my wrists are so painful for about 4 hours. My shoulder hurts more than usual, but I do have a torn rotator cuff and need surgery that my dr won't do until I'm off prednisone. Last night I upped my prednisone 1/2 mg (I take 5 mg in the am and 2 1/2 at night) but no difference this morning with my wrists. My question is, should I up the prednisone more? I am traveling to Vietnam and Cambodia next week, I'm bringing extra prednisone just in case! I don't know if my wrists are hurting because of a flare and upping the pred will help, or continue with the 7 1/2 daily and live with the pain in the morning. I am worried about the 17 1/2 hr flight!
sorry this post was so long, but I wanted to tell all!

"Ha! I am so chuffed! I have reached 7.5 daily. That's 8 days running now... Thanks to you Eileen and your DSNS method. Fingers crossed it remains good. No pain just ridiculous tiredness and breathlessness. That I can cope with, annoying as it is.
I started on 15mg in July 2014 after nearly a year without a diagnosis, and am now thinking that it is possible that with this method of reduction I would have been able to come down more quickly, but who knows.... I started DSNS when I was having trouble getting down from 10mg in June. It's been straight forward ever since. Now, I know that it may well become more difficult from now on, but at least I have something to believe in. I am alone in this, apart from all you guys, because my GP isn't interested unless I reduce really quickly, so I don't see her. I arranged for blood tests now and again when I was planning a reduction or I had some pain but they've been normal since I started Prednisolone. She says, of course they are! The amount of steroids you are taking! Oh dear, I was doing my best to get them down.
Anyway, enough moaning about her! I'm doing ok thanks to your help and advice. And right now jubilant to have reached 7.5. Am going to stay on this dose for a couple of weeks more because I am going to Norway to visit my daughter and her very lively Viking boys on Thursday and I will need all the steroids I can get.... Hehe...

"Hello,
Thanks to all of you for the assistance and reassurance your posts provided to me as I travelled my PMR journey.
Over a five year period, I had three bouts of PMR - on prednisone for a year, off for several months, hit again, back on pred, off again for several months, then hit with the third whammy.  I've now been off pred for a full year, have no PMR pain, and my blood tests are normal.  Hallelujah!
However, I am left with a few health concerns and don't know if they are related to my PMR or not, and I'm hoping someone from this group may have dealt with similar symptoms and may be able to help me out.  I have a very tight chest which makes each breath an effort and gets worse with strenuous activity.  This problem started before I finished with  prednisone.   I'm still hit with with bouts of sudden-onset fatigue, and suffer from hot flashes (not related to menopause - I'm well past that), usually occurring in the wee hours of the morning. I also have frequent  drops in blood pressure (eg 83/42) which result in light headedness.
I've been thoroughly checked out by both a respirologist and a cardiologist - lung function and sleep apnea tests, EKG, stress test, echo stress test, and cardiac catheterization.  Very minimal things detected but nothing to worry about, and nothing to explain my health problems.
Other than these concerns, I'm slim, fit, eat well, exercise regularly, don't smoke, and drink only a glass or two of wine per week.  Can't think of any lifestyle changes I could make to improve my health.
Doctors aren't sure what's causing my problems, and I'm hoping someone from this group may have dealt with similar concerns and found an explanation.  I will appreciate any leads you can offer me to regain my health.

"I am needing input from those with the experience and knowledge about our disease.  I am struggling right now.  Need help with the next step and ideas about if what is going on is normal for PMR.  I had a pretty good flare this summer and waited at least 6 weeks before I realized that's what was going on.  At the end of August my doc jumped my preds from 13 mg to 20 mg.  Had relief within hours then I wasn't quite as good the next day.  Continued to have stiffness in my hips, muscles in my upper back down my arms, but the most painful thing was the pain in my right groin, going down my quads and in the trocanter area of my hip.  Before upping to 20 mg.  could not lift my foot to get dressed etc.  After 20 mg my leg improved but I still have the stiffness and pain.  In addition, the tiredness, fatigue and continued lack of energy has been overwhelming.  I know some of this could be from the prednisone.  I did not realize I would be so impacted by PMR.  Even though the preds have helped the pain in most parts of my body, I still have all the stiffness which, comes and goes, and severe fatigue.  Have found I am VERY sensitive to Prednisone. I can't clean my house or do much of anything without my back and arms becoming stiff and sore.  My dear husband does all the cleaning, laundry, dishes etc.  I do a very little and then have to lie down or rest.  I try to walk once a day if I can.  I usually go about half a mile and it takes me about 25 minutes.  Usually nap once or twice a day for 2 hours each time.  When at 13 mg before the flare, I had a few days where I didn't have to lay down at all and was feeling pretty good on those days all things considered.  I have been diagnosed since January, 2015 and have had maybe 3 or 4 sporadic days where I felt pretty good and knew there was light at the end of the tunnell.  My sons, ages 46 and 48, don't understand why there isn't something else besides prednisone to help.  Have been uncuccessful at explaining why there isn't.  After a month back up at 20 mg, started the DSNS method.  Dropped to 18 mg for one day and then back to 20 mg. and this sent my system reeling.  I am having severe memory problems, processing problems, finding the right words to express myself etc. Double and blurred vision are worse with higher dose. Doc thinks it's the prednisone but just had me have a CT Scan to rule out anything else.  Help....What is my next step?  And thanks to all of you.  Linda

"My rheumatologist (Mayo clinic trained) wants me to add 10 mg of hydrocortisone (which I believe is equal to about 2.5 mg of prednisone) to my daily dose of prednisone.  I am still to taper the prednisone. 
To me, that means that if I am taking 13 mg. of prednisone, then adding the hydrocortisone increases me to a dose of at least 15 mg. of corticosteroids.
She said this is the more natural version of cortisone and that it has fewer side effects.  I am hesitant to add the hydrocortisone to my 13 mg.  It makes no sense to me.  It has the same side effects listed as the prednisone does.  I have asked her why, and she only says that it works differently and so I should not worry about it. That answer is not acceptable to me.  Does anyone have any information on adding hydrocortisone to prednisone in treating PMR?  I have not seen it mentioned anywhere else. 
By the way, since I have so many side effects from the prednisone, I surely don't want to take another medication that has the exact same side effects listed.  I am hoping that as I taper down the side effects will lesson.  I hope I have explained this issue correctly so that it is not too hard to understand.

It is low impact, and at the time I had thought it would be perfect for me, as I need to lose weight, and have a desk job, and NEVER exercise. I will be seeing my Dr. in 2 days to discuss the PMR and see what he says; but do any of you think I will be able to go back to this class eventually, or will need to find something easier, like walking to do for exercise? I was only in my 5th week of classes when I started getting sick with the PMR; but it was so much fun, and with proper eating ( I am diabetic), I was losing 1 pound a week with the classes. Just curious as to what exercises, if any you all do? Thanks.

"I have experienced this condition for over 18 mnths now, and feel I would have been in a terrible situation if not for prednislone. It is managable with this drug and I think I am over the worst. Doctors are not much help as this is a grey area in medicine and at present time not that much is known, My wife and I diagnosed the condition and had to plead with the doctor for a blood test which showed the inflammetry markers confirming we were right and he was wrong. I finally stopped taking the pred and started to try ibprofen here and there. This worked for a while and then had pain at night again, but managed to cope with it. I have been self medicating for a month now taking one or two mil of pred. I am now coping and back to some light weight training as I was an athlete. I participated in olympic freestyle wrestling and weight training for many years, but do not think it had any bearing on the illness, as my mother had a history of reaumatic and arthritic complaints and I believe it to be handed down with the genes. I hope I have been some help to others in the same situation. Regards Peter Jeffery

"Hi everyone,
My name is Kelly and I have just been diagnosed with PMR after a year of pain that started in my L thigh/hip.  The pain changed this summer and it is now in both hips and my right arm.  The arm pain is excruciating at night.  My mom also had PMR and was diagnosed at age 56.  I had my first elevated Sed Rate, 34 and CPR >14, in 2013 but I didn't have pain then.  At the time the elevations were not looked into.  My most recent tests are SR of 47 and CPR of .98.  Bilateral hip x-rays normal.  I was finally started on Prednisone on 09/06/15 at 20mg but have yet to see results. I was supposed to taper to 10mg starting tomorrow.   I expected to feel better already.  My question is this...are there patients out there that take longer to respond to the Prednisone in the beginning?  Everything I've read seems to show that most people have a dramatic turn within 48 hrs.  My GP is keeping me on the 20mg for now.  She is trying to get me in to the rheumatologist ASAP, current appt isnt until Dec 1st.  Hate my insurance, but thankful to have it at all.  I have now had this pain untreated for a year, and it is like nothing I've ever felt before.  I can't even straighten my left leg anymore.  I am going to PT as well.  Any advice from you pros out there would be most appreciated.
Thanks so much!!!!

"I cannot believe what these steroids are doing to me now! I will try to be as delicate as I can to explain my latest development. A few days ago after visiting the bathroom, I noticed, what I can only describe as a pile of coffee granules in the loo. This rung alarm bells, so I googled it and found out that as I suspected this was actually from internal bleeding somewhere. Somewhat apprehensive, I managed to book an emergency appointment with my surgery. Couldn't see my usual dr, so a tad emarassing having to explain details! Anyway he thinks it was due to my gastritis. He tested my iron levels which were not too bad for me (12). If it happens again or I start coughing up these granules I have to go straight back. Anyone else had this happen and if so, what was the outcome? I must admit I thought the dr was quite blase' about it. Hope everyone's having a 'good' day. Debbie

"I've been suffering from headaches for over 8 months now, been to GP God knows how many times and have been given 5 different medications. Seen a neurologist who was no help whatsoever! I googled my symptoms and temporal arteritis came up. Went back to my GP yesterday and told her I think this is what I have. She didn't really believe me as she said I'm too young to have it (I'm 25) Anyway she agreed to send me to have my bloods taken. The next available appointment isn't for another 2 weeks! I've been reading up about it and have read that it's important to start treatment straight away. Surely I can't wait 2 weeks for a blood test? I've suffered everyday for the past 8 months and can't bear to wait any longer! I just need to feel better again, and by reading other people's stories it looks like the tablets make you feel better almost straight away!

"Hi all. I was just doing a bit of research online when I came across an article I thought might be of interest to us all. Apparently, although doctors have known for ages that steroids reduce inflamation, they didn't know how they did it! Recently a Dr Li and team have discovered the answer. This means that work may finally be able to start on finding an alternative to Pred, without the side effects! Great news, although probably too late for us! Hopefully our children and grandchildren may not have to suffer, in the unfortunate event of them needing steroid type treatment. If you want to read the article, I googled 'steroids new research' then selected 'medindia' then 'new trick steroids use to suppress inflamation'.

"With Polymyalgia have you experienced weakness in the muscles of the inner thigh of one leg in particular?  I have had PMR for 2 years and the last number of months have had off and on stiffness in the buttocks and weakness in the inner thigh muscles of one leg.  Lately the inner thigh muscles has been very weak and I'm limping when walking on it, almost as if it won't support me.  I am amazed at this development as up to now I have stiffness but nothing like this.  I'd welcome any experiences or advice you may have here.

"Hi everyone,
I haven't been on the forum for a while, but would like to post a positive message, which I hope is encouraging to all of you.
Some of you might know that I am an Archer and at the beginning of August I took part in 'The South West Challenge' which is 8 days of archery across tough terrain in Devon and Cornwall.  Due to my PMR, I only managed to complete 4 days, spread out over the 8, in 2013/2014, but this year I managed the whole 8 days and won in my class.  Over the 8 days we walked over 60 miles, mostly on very steep slopes and through woodland and shot about 60 arrows each day, sometimes more.  Out of the 150 archers that took part, 4 of us have PMR, 2 of which are men and the other lady and myself are 55 and 52 years of age.  I got through this by pacing myself and relaxing in the evening, with plenty of sleep and not too much alcohol! The best bit is that I still felt great on day 8 and continued to feel good afterwards.
Shortly before doing the Challenge, I saw a different GP who has been a breath of fresh air! He has a very good understanding of PMR and GCA and supports a very slow reduction of Prednisolone.  I was due to start reducing to 4mg daily, but he said as my body was going to be under more stress, it would be best to stay on 41/2 mg while doing the Challenge.  Just having this understanding and support is enough to make me feel better in itself.
I am now settled on 4mg of Predisolone.  I have days where I feel those rumblings of PMR and fatigue, more than others and my muscles are not yet up to full strength, but generally I feel pretty good and hopeful for the future.  I have lost about 10 lb's in weight and at last my ankles are not as swollen. I keep as active as I can, but also look after myself and have learnt to say 'No'....well sometimes anyway!
In your darkest moments, when trying to cope with PMR/GCA, keep in mind that things really can get better and there is very, definitely, hope x

"Hi. Been a long time since I last posted but do follow all posts regularly. 
My question relates to my new GP as, having moved to Banbury from Harrow back in Jan this year, I have been experiencing a rather 'unsympathetic' attitude in my treatment. I am 18 months post diagnosis and was doing very well until my move, which triggered a massive flare. I have since come down from 20mg to 10mg but never really got rid of the pains in my upper body this time. They are tolerable though...just!  I was recently seen by a rheumatologist who confirmed my diagnosis despite GP thinking I was too young at 56 now 58. Rheumy thought that some of my shoulder pain was down to rotator cuff (suggested this to GP!) and offered steroid injection as physio not helped much. However, I asked to have this done at my local hospital rather than have an hours drive into Oxford. He said that my GP would need to refer me, which I think I may have trouble with as he ruled it out before 'because I am already on steroids'. According to him as my blood results are normal (have been since initial diagnosis) I am in remission (or do not have pmr) hence the drive to wean me off them. Fortunately the rheumatologist has confirmed and agreed to a reduction plan of 1mg a month. So I have some ammunition at least. But still the relentless reduction to zero! Hence my question at the start of my post. Sorry it has taken so long to get to! 
I have an appt to see my GP on Tuesday at his minor surgery clinic with a view to having the injection (kindly booked by the reception desk) but feel I have a battle on my hands to convince him either way about my treatment. I have even taken in posts from this site plus the Bristol paper, but he refused to read them. This is the 2nd GP I've seen in the practice and both have the same attitude. I don't know what else to do except change practice, which would involve greater distance to get there and may be just as hostile.

"its nearly three years and down to 7mgs of Prednisolone and Naproxen. Then Doc says must stop the Naproxen as its better to up the Prednisolone to 10 mugs . . . .
A year ago I was referred to the Rhumi and using Eileen's method got down to 8mgs but as I have OA the lower the Prednisolone the more the OA in my back showed so Naproxen was added to the mix! It worked brilliantly and I got down to a pain free 6mgs. But the came a pill review and my Doctor was really anxious about Prednisolone and naproxen and stopped me to paracetamol, which did nothing but leave me in pain so I put myself back on naproxen and went back to the doc. Blood tests showed my markers right down to my lowest ever. I was having no Polymyalgia rheumatica [PMR] pains just terrible back pain like sciatica. The doc insists I must stick with Prednisolone only but can't go over 10mgs but no more naproxen.
i am doubled over with pain and am going to ask to see the rhumi again. I ha declined MX.
i believe the Polymyalgia rheumatica [PMR] has really subsided to needing less than 5 mugs a day but only if topped up with Naproxen for pain cover.
What can I do . . . . sounds pathetic but the pain is a huge challenge, especially when I was doing so well.
I know I'm not alone so what thoughts are there.
Thanks, David

"Hi all, couple of weeks ago saw doctor with agonising stiffness and pain, doctor thinks it's PMR. Put on 40 mg per day of steroids, pain and stiffness gone in hours.
I'm right age , symptoms text book and the steroid treatment worked dramatically as the doctor described. My blood test has come back clear ( nothing to confirm PMR). The Doctor did say blood tests don't always show PMR, I still feel his DX was right as all the indicators/ symptoms are text book as stated. What do you think re blood test confirmation (or lack of it) ?

"Hi everyone.  Have cherished all the informtion I have gleaned from all of the posts.  I am about 2 years into PMR and currently taking 9.5 mg. of prednisone.  Frequently, I have severe pain in my sacroliac area, which I think is due to a slight flare and the rheumy says it is not.  When feeling well, I have no difficulities at all.  Had a back fusion about 4 years ago (with awesome results), and have been x-rayed more than once and there is no physical problem with the exception of starting of osteo in back.  Guess I'm asking if anyone else is experiencing this or just me.  Since I have other areas that will flare and not just the sacroiliac area, guess I'm really am thinking it is from PMR.

The result I have broken my calcaneus bone where it meets the cuboid bone.

do you think I should continue with the reduction, stay on 7.5 or up my dose considerably and of course along with all if the options his long should I stay on/at any of these options.

My history--I was diagnosed at Mayo Clinic in September 2011 after seeing 24 doctors. I am in the United States and have only had one short course of prendisone for a rash and felt great but have had none so far per my doctors decision. I have had a normal sed rate since being diagnosed.  I am getting in touch with my doctor to see if I have had a CRP test. Im questioning if I have both PMR and Fibromyalgia and am only being treated for the fibromyalgia which puts me on Cymbalta and tramidol.

"Hi
I have just finished steroids which I was prescribed for GCA which my Rheumy said I did not have....
Since finishing the steroids I have been suffering with a deep ache in my shoulders, hips and thighs.  Having been reading this site I thought I may have PMR my doc sent blood for testing and has just told me that there were no inflammatory markers so it could not be PMR.  I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia several years ago but this new pain is different and I don't think it is Fibro.
My question is this:  Can you have PMR but no inflammatory indicators in your blood, and if so what's the best way forward with my GP.
Thanks so much

"I am a patient suffering with the polymyalgia RMT syndrome since this last April. I received a 15 mg prednisone treatment from the begining and now reduce to 2 mg. My condition was chronic and I thought that I can never move around like a normal person again, but now I almost have no pain and left is just ache in my body which I can deal with. Recently I received 3 times of Qigong therapy treatment and pratice Qigong which is particularly designed for this type of problem. And I found it gives me a big improvement. I think if the improvement continue in the same speed, I probably can be out of the prednisone in 2 months.

"I am 67 years old and several months ago was diagnosed with polymyalgia. Started on 15 mg but had bad side effects with physical anxiety like pounding heart, shaking etc.I am now taking 10mg prednisolone daily which seems to be almost controlling the symptons. However, my legs are quite painful at times. I am uncertain what to do. My doctor says I can try taking 5mg and 10mg dosage on alternate days to see how I manage on this. I get days when I am extremely tired, like today and it is a struggle to do anything. Howevever, tomorrow I may feel better! I make myself take the dog out daily otherwise I feel my muscles will not function and I will be worse. I have no stamina - is this normal? I have also put on 7 lbs in weight and have quite a double chin which is very depressing. Am trying to keep positive but it is difficult. Are all these things normal?

"Hi all,
Well I finally found a Bowen Therapist and this is what I found out when I talked to her on the telephone.
1.  She did not know about PMR -- never heard of it.
2.  She did not know of myofascia pain syndrome, although she knew what myofascia was in general.
3.  She is not a masseuse (sp), nor does she have any related experience.
4.  She stumbled across Bowen therapy because she was in pain herself and thought it might help her (it did), so she wanted to help others.
5.  She's been helping people for about 5 years.
Should I beware of this person, or is this typical of Bowen therapists?

I told them I wasn't there for drugs! 
Well...I'll be dang if he didn't almost immediatly say, take this drug... And we will do anesthesia injections... I said I'm on Prednisone, and he said oh...well don't take that drug take this drug...Geez, didn't he read my medication list!!! 
So... He gave me Lyrica and generic Duloxetine (Cymbalta generic).
anyone trying this for pains other than our Polymyalgia pains? I took it once before for 6 weeks (pre PMR), made me so tired. 
I'm not so convince more drugs are then answer.  Feel doctors just try them to see what works, but with all my Prednisone side effects I really don't want to add more to mixture!!!!

"Hi, I was diagnosed with PMR about a month ago, ESR level was 47 which came down to 37 after two weeks on prednisone.   GP tells me I should be OK in about six weeks.   Don't know where these doctors get their information from, certainly in my readings I haven't come across anyone who had such a miraculous recovery..   Prednisone (15mg) helps but only as long as I do absolutely nothing.   NSAIDs take the edge off the pain but I can't take more than a couple of doses before I become nauseated.   Supposedly there is no apparent cause, I had an elbow arthroscopy about four months ago which led to an infection and then the PMR shortly after, no brainer for me.    PMR affects my arms mostly:   wrists, forearms, elbows, shoulders and neck, and of course any activity like riding my bike and the whole body gets involved, .   I've found if I do anything more strenuous than brush my teeth the pain at night and in the morning is excruciating, some mornings I need help to dress myself..   So now I guess I'll be stuck in an armchair for the next few years.  
I'm also a diabetic (oh joy) but have worked out an insulin regime which requires doubling/tripling my insulin to maintain BGLs.depending on time of day, my GP doesn't get too involved with my diabetes control unless I ask him to, he believes I have it under excellent control.   Also don't see a specialist for the same reason.  
Previously in defence for most of my life I led a very active life: cycling, kayaking, sailing, walking, running, weight lifting and working in my well equipped shed designing and constructing things (something I enjoy immensely), but now I'm down to just the one activity - armchairing, ain't life wonderful.   I'll be seeing my GP in another 5 weeks or so at which time he expects my ESR levels to be in the normal range, from my experience so far I'm assuming after the ESR levels normalise I wiil still have the pain for a few years to come.   I also suffer from OA of hips, back, neck, shoulders, elbows, etc, at my age (64) and with my skeletal condition I don't have too many good years left, not too sure I can handle this, or more to the point I'm not too sure I really want to,- this is just not a life I'm interested in!   Thanks for reading, hoped it might make my feel better venting - it hasn't!

"My unresolved hip pain which was alternately attributed to PMR and tendonitis has been clarified following two MRIs. I have AVN in both hip joints, one collapsed femoral head and osteo arthritis. This may or may not be caused by Prednisone. The three predisposing risk factors are excessive alcohol use (not me), long term use of steroids (i'm going on 2 years although never over 10 mg and very gradual reduction) and of course, ""idiopathic.""
I am facing two hip replacements in the near future and am pretty heartsick although looking forward to a reduction in the debilitating pain and hopefully a good outcome and the ability to resume activities I enjoy.
So part of my message is the reminder (which I know you all know) that Pred is not a benign drug at all and can create a cascade of serious problems.
But here's my current hitch. i have been at 5 mg since May and the surgeons don't like to operate with Pred on board as it creates greater risk for infection etc. I reduced to 4.5 two days ago. My hip joints are the big deal at the moment-- I don't know if some pain is PMR or not.
I see rheumy tomorrow.
HOW do we assess stability/activity of PMR?
Do you continue Pred with dx of AVN if that is causing it?
HOW do you treat both conditions?
Is there any thing at all I can do to speed up reduction of Pred OR the activation of Adrenals?
What are the tests that the rheumy should be looking at?
I am worried I will go through these two surgeries and still have pain and disability and no way to treat it. Thank you for your thoughts and encouragement. I have followed what I believed to be pretty sound medical protocols and am feeling pretty heart broken.

"Hello, I have been diagnosed with polymyalgia 4 weeks or so ago. Symptoms had been creeping on for several months and got so bad eventually I got my gp involved. Despite bloods coming back clear, he felt polymyalgia was the cause. I was given prednisalone 40 mgs. Within 24hrs I could walk, climb stairs, dress without pain. It was remarkable. After one week the dose was reduced to 35mgs as I was pretty hyperactive and experiencing several bouts of arythmia and palpitations a day. Although he didn't know of these symptoms as a side effect of the drug, he decided it was the way to go. The palpitations all but disappeared within 3 days as did the hyper feeling. He then asked me to reduce to 20mgs. Suddenly the muscle and joint pain returns. I put myself up to 25mgs to see if there was any improvement but to no avail and as each day passes it gets a bit worse. I'm not due to see him until next week, but I'm wondering if he has reduced too quickly. Consensus of advice appears to be that very slowly wins the race. Would be grateful to hear your thoughts

"Hi
My husband has been diagnosed with PMR and is taking prednisolone, 12 mgs. a day.  He takes 7mgs in the morning and 5 mgs. at night. In the morning he feels tired, fuzzy in the head, with aching and weak legs and a higher heart rate until about 3pm. He usually just falls asleep in the morning until the symptoms get better. Does anyone else feel like this? Thanks Jackie

"I have been impressed by the level of knowledge and willingness to share advice on this forum.  I have been battling an undiagnosed illness over the past 19 months. PMR is now being considered.  I will try to keep this concise, but I can see that many of you have also experienced  prolonged diagnosis stories. 
Here is my background and relevant medical history. I’m 54 and have been very active my whole life. Had C3-7 spinal fusion in 2008 - herniated discs and bone spurs from an accident.  Raynauds for the past 10 years.  Diagnosed with late stage Lyme disease in 2009.  Contracted Lyme in 2008, very ill for 7 days with 104 fever, even photographed the rash. Lyme has been treated several times over the years with 6 weeks of antibiotics and once with 3 weeks of IV antibiotics.  Since 2009, Lyme type of illness knocked me down once every 3-6 months for 1-2 weeks. 
Current illness started February 10, 2014.  It had felt like I was starting a round of Lyme symptoms, due to increased muscle pain and fatigue.  I then awoke in the middle of the night with stabbing pain under my shoulder blade and could not move the right side of my body.   This was unlike anything I had ever experienced.  I couldn’t even take a breath without the stabbing pain.  All of my muscles were painful, twitching and in spasms.  I thought that my spinal fusion failed. Saw my spine doctor.  He ordered MRI.  Then new symptoms of night sweats, migraine, fever, dizziness, eye disturbances and GI problems started.  The pain under my shoulder blade migrated to the other shoulder blade.  The new symptoms now seemed to point to Lyme. 
I tried to see my Infectious Disease doc, we refer to as Dr. House.  He couldn’t see me for 3 weeks.  I then found a “Lyme specialist” who could see me.  She had me go on an anti-inflammatory diet, immune system supplements and Chinese herbal antibiotics.  I finally got in to see Dr. House.  He felt that my Lyme disease had triggered PMR and GCA, the treatment is long term steroids and I should see a Rheumatologist.  The Lyme specialist reminded me that steroids are terrible for Lyme.  Back to Dr. House.  Let him know that I was feeling somewhat better with the supplements and diet.  Decided to continue treatment with Lyme doc but keep PMR and GCA in mind. 
The fevers and night sweats finally subsided after 4 months, due to Lyme doc treatment or just the course of the illness.  By November, my symptoms shifted to be primarily severe muscle pain in my quadriceps, shoulders, arms and trapezius.  I also had nerve pain in my hands and some dizziness and fatigue. My muscles had atrophied significantly.  Back to spine doctor.  He ordered MRI’s of neck, back and brain.  Nothing significant on findings.  Referred to Rheumatology and then Neurology. Spinal tap, autonomic testing and multiple EMG’s.  Neurology now feels that I should go back to Rheumatology.
Here are the results of this medical saga.  Blood work – initial sed rate of 48, C reactive protein of 4.8, slightly anemic, elevated liver enzymes, low insulin 1.6 – some blood sugar issues.
EMG showed bilateral carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve entrapments.  This 2 hour EMG from hell really flared my symptoms.  I ended up in urgent care and requested a steroid burst.  The burst reduced symptoms by day 3. 
I’m not a fan of the young Rheumatologist I was assigned.  He was immediately offended that the Infectious Disease doctor would suggest PMR when it’s outside his specialty.  That’s the way it always works when I watch Dr. House.  A good Infectious Disease doctor has to know a lot about every type of condition.  He also feels that at age 54, I’m too young for PMR.  My sed rate and C reactive Protein were initially elevated, but were normal when last tested in December.  Didn’t agree with my research that PMR patients very often have Carpal Tunnel.  I asked him to give me his opinion or even a short list of what this could be.  Not one suggestion.  He is tapering me off steroids and then will run repeat blood work.  I have never been so frustrated and miserable.  I just want this saga to end.

The stage i am at now is between 9mg and 8mg, when i went to see the rhemy she said not to do it in half doses, but 1mg full dose, but i find this is too much, so i am continuing to do it this way, i know she has her reasons for me to come off pred (she needs to find out what is wrong) but i think doing it too quickly in my case is not the answer, so we shall see, i know some of you when you get to s certain level feel this also, i understand when we get to 7mg our own cortison has to kick in and this causes problems so i will see what happens then.

"Beginning to feel like a bit of a hypochondriac.  A few weeks ago I noticed veins in my right arm and hand really (alarmingly) bulging, a little in my left but not as bad.  Put it down, then, to my weight loss, that the veins could be now so much more prominent.  But reading about vascular diseases makes me wonder.... is this a symptom worth mentioning to my GP?  Is it common?  Is it a pred side effect?  Or am I (hopefully!) just being a hypochondriac?

"Hey all, I’m so glad you are all here to come to for support.  It means that I have some people in the world who understand.
I wonder why my rheum. Dr. is trying to convince me that the pain I’m feeling is fibromyalgia.  Why is he changing his diagnosis from Polymyalgia to Fibromyalgia?  Here’s what I want to tell him: I’ve had fibro for 30 years and know what it feels like.  Then about 3 years ago I got this extra pain, a firey pain in my shoulders, arms, hips, legs.  My general dr. sent me to you (Dr. P.) about it, and when you gave me the pamphlet on PMR, the symptoms exactly fit this new pain.  I was thankful for knowing what it was.  And then the prednisone helped me right away.  
At the beginning my SED was 45.  That was when I was not being treated.  With pred. it went down to 20.  Then as I tried to reduce the pred. it went up bit by bit, and then I had pneumonia and the inflammation was much higher.  Since then I’ve tried to reduce the pred gradually, but then at 13mg I had a flare up.  I went back up to 15.  At 15mg my SED is still high at 40 when I took a test last week.  I am in so much pain!  I sleep a lot to get away from the pain, which I know is not good. 
Is it true that this is fibromyalgia, and I‘m wrong to think it is PMR?  Why does he want to change the diagnosis?  Just to get me to stop the prednisone?  What do you all think?

"I have an appointment with my GP next week so want to go armed with lots of info.  Started with pred 9th June 15 mg.  Stayed on this dose for 4 weeks (miracle cure after at least a year of suffering).  Started reduction by 1 mg every week.  Fine until I went to 9 mg.  Symptoms returned although not as severe as before.  Stayed on for 10 days, got worse, so upped to 10 and have been there since ((21st Aug), much better but not as well as I was at the beginning of the treatment. Obviously would like to get down at least to 7 as soon as safely can.  Have found in the forum that idea of taking current dose for 6 days, then reduce for one, take old dose for 5, reduce for one day, old dose 4 days and so forth until the new dose becomes the old dose. Are there aother options?   Would I be better advised to try dropping by 1/2 mg but maybe more frequently?  Should I be considering upping the dosage again (with GP blessing) in order to clear symptoms completely again before trying to wean off again, or is this as good as it gets (which is not bad, I have to say, and I don't seem, so far, to have any major side effects).

"Saw Dr Sarah Bingham, what a lovely lady.
Now after many disscusions and i might had she knew all my previous history even tho we had never meet before today, she has come tp the conclusion 90% sure i do not have PMR, but have had some blood tests done, yellow bottle, green bottle and brown bottle. Also was sent for X Rays on my spine and neck, everyone has been brilliant i must say.
She has looked through the notes regarding (forgive the spelling) the geonodes, which she says his holes in my hips which cause curving in the hip joint, and she thinks this was not PMR related, 
She also thinks my neck and spine is the problem, and so she wants me off steroids as she said some of my problems like eye pain, headaches and all the earaches are side effects of the pred not PMR.
I do hope she is right, as i would hate , as much as i do not like being on pred she is not taking me off for all the wrong reasons, as GCA is lurking around i do not want it to be a problem later on.
So she is happy for me to do the DSNS method at 1mg reduction, and i gave her a copy of it Eileen, as she said that seems better than the one she uses for her patients.
So some good has come out of today.
I would appreciate your feedback on this please, and your comments regarding your thoughts about PMR,

"This article was taken from the CSS Association's site:Reducing Steroids while on a Low Dose & Activating the Adrenal Glands By Marian Mesker
""We are living with a body that's relying on a drug to get enough
cortisol to function properly.
At 7.5 mg. prednisone (this is an average, it could differ from 5 - 10 mg. for different people) the adrenal glands should get activated and produce their own cortisol again. Eventually the adrenals will take over again, but this needs time.
What can we do to support the body and stimulate the adrenal glands to produce cortisol again?
---The adrenal cortex, the outer portion of adrenal glands, needs cholesterol to produce hormones. Therefore our diet should contain fat, both saturated and not-saturated. Although completely avoiding animal fat is unwise in this case, moderate consumption is better. Cod liver oil is especially good as it also supplies vitamin A, which is necessary for the adrenal cortex to make adrenal hormones out of cholesterol.
---Other major nutrients the adrenal cortex needs to do its job are: vitamins B5 (pantothenic acid) and B6 (especially the co-enzyme form of vitamin B was mentioned) and vitamin C. These should be obtained from food sources or whole food supplements.
There is a bloodtest to check this: the cortrosyn (ACTH) stimulation test. They'll draw some blood, then give an ACTH-injection (the stimulating hormone for the adrenal gland to make steroids) and after a while draw blood again. If the test shows that it's needed, the adrenal glands can be stimulated by ACTH injections. It is not very likely that ACTH injections will be necessary, though. In almost every patient the adrenal gland starts functioning   again w    hen cortisone is tapered, it just needs time

"may I use prednisone like aspirin?
I am 70, male, GCA, 4mg with a CRP 1.5 and am currently tapering using the ""Dead Slow Method"" discussed in this blog. I HATE pills and only use them when necessary. During my life time I have used aspirin only when I have had injuries or other sever aches and pains.
I now find myself using pred in that manner, let me explain. in the last 4 months I have had three episodes of temple pain. The episodes wer once in England when I contracted a sever cold, once after 5 days of painting the barn and just Sunday while going through the cleansing prep for a colonoscopy. When these events occurred, I doubled my normal daily dose for that day and continued on. 
In effect, I am using prednisone like I have used aspirin. I pulled the following data from my prednisone prescription data. Has anyone heard or know of an objection to my use of prednisone?
Patients with known or suspected renal insufficiency, including those already receiving replacement therapy require an increase in dosage or reinstitution of therapy prior to, during and for a time following exposure to stress.

"Hi Everyone,
my dr put me on 10mg of pred last Wednesday for PMR, and told me that I'll feel great. Well I don't. In the morning I'm still pretty achey and stiff. It usually takes until the afternoon before I feel better. Is this normal, would this still happen if I was on a higher dose? Some of you said that 10mg is too low to start with, but it seems to be what they do in the U.S. I guess my questions is, would it help to push for a higher dose, or would I still have the morning pain until the pred kicked in? How do you know when you're on the correct dose?
it really helps to read about other people's journey with this, doctors don't seem to have a clue.

My doc increased my press from 13 mg to 20 mg. said to stay at that dose for 3 days then drop to 17.5 mg and stay there for 3 days and then drop to 15 mg. I think dropping 2.5 mg at a time is too much for me. Also, is staying at each dose for 3 days long enough?

Was reluctant to increase back to 20 but my pain and stiffness that returned told me I was overdue to give it a shot. Took my first 20 mg dose at 6:30 AM and by 9:30 AM felt remarkably better. This afternoon my stiffness and pain is a little worse than this

"I have had PMR since 2011 but it was not treated until 2013. In 2013 I had extreme heartburn and chest pain that sent me to ER. I had been taking ibuprofen for joint pain not knowing I had PMR. My exam showed nothing except a high lipase level of over 500
Further exam by endoscopy for a hemangioma on my liver showed 2 small cysts in my pancreas. I have no symptoms of any kind now for 2 years. I was told to follow up in 2 years with another endoscopy.That test is coming Sept. 2. My lipase is still high.

"I diagnosed my PMR after many flares. My GP did not know how to treat me when my Sed rate came back at 58. CRP in normal range. Called prescription of Prednisdone: 60 mg one week, 40 next week, 20 following week. I knew that was not the way to treat it. 60 did not relieve symptoms , so I increased to 80. I know that was not the way to go but felt my GP didn't have a clue.
I have now been to a rheumatologist who changed my prescription to Methylprenisdone 16 mg tablets. I was instructed to take 48 mg. daily. I had reduced my 80 mg to 75mg before seeing him. I felt that was too fast. I started at 54 mg. daily. Was down to 40 but went back 48 mg.
My question: what is the difference in regular Prednisdone and Methylprenisdone? Has anybody taken both and noticed any difference except Methylprenisdone is very much more expensive?
By the way my ""rhemey"" thinks PMR last for 2 years only and since I have had this since sometime 2014. I should be phasing out of this. What say you all? From what I read I don't think he's got a clue either. I feel sometime I'm surrounded be idiots. Might be time to find a new rhumatologist.

"hello.
My Mom, who is 82 years old has suspected GCA. She has already lost vision in one eye, and is waiting for a temporal biopsy, which she will have this coming Monday. after reading about GCA and PA, I am sure she had symptoms of PA two years ago, but was not sent to a rheumatologist by her GP, as she should have been then. My worry right now is that she is not on a high enough starting dose of prednisone given her vision loss. She currently has developed vision disturbances in her 'good eye' now, and does not see the specialist again until Monday when she is scheduled for the biopsy. I am worrying that she will lose her vision in the remaining good eye. Her starting dose of prednisone is 40 mg once a day. She is small; weighing about 100 pounds. Is this a high enough dose to start given the vision implications? I tried to get her to call the doctor and ask, but she says no, she will wait to see them on Monday. (Today is Saturday). 
I'm in a different province so am not there, just talking on the phone. I'm scared
, and feel helpless.

"I have PMR (diagnosed 5 months), Fibromyalgia ( 18 years). Dr says i am not reacting to Pred as I should. I have many new weird health problems come and go. Dr always looks vague about them. Recently I had a very scary 'brain shutdown'. I had no concept of going to sleep, or waking up, but I suddenly did not know where I was, or who I was with. Friends were with us - someone said something which bought me around. They all thought I was sitting there quietly. I believe I was out of it for approx 40 mins. I had no conscious memory of what happened in that missing time, but when told about it I was aware of it. When I told Dr, he said ""now that is a Pred problem"". It does scare me - I have not seen anyone else mention it - I was under stress at the time. He has been really reluctant to refer me on to a Specialist, but has now done so, because of it. Has anyone experience this ?

"hi I'm new to this pmr having just started steroids almost 3 weeks ago, I see rheumatoigist next week to discuss how treatment is working I guess, anyway within a few days the pain and stiffness have gone with the exception sometimes in the mornings my upper back still feels rather tender but I do have restricted movement in shoulders due to frozen shoulders from 7 years ago so that could be the cause of that . I am pleased that the pain and stiffness have gone but I work in a shop and I am on my feet all day by the end I am aching and so tired I could sleep for a week the problem is when it's time to go to bed I struggle to get to sleep and toss and turn all night , I was so looking forward to a good nights sleep once treatment worked , I also find I sweat a lot this is different to the hot flushes I sometimes I get does anybody else experience this and have any remedies I could try to sleep please

"Lets start over. From older threads, there is an optimum time to take our pred. However the longer we are on it, the more of a task it becomes, especially the early morning target. My question is simply does the pred dose last longer than 24 hours so we can be a little sloppy in our timing without starting a flare etc? Local chemist was only interested in getting back to his phone and quickly said 24 hours and you must take next dose. My opinion is that there is a level in  your system all the time if you have been taking it every day. This level will make up for any change in timing.

Then pains in the temple and eyes are less is this because of the pred doing its job or maybe the lower dose suits me better, any thoughts please.

"Hi all. I have been given steroids as a trial. 10mg for 2 weeks. (alrhough I upped it to 15 myself after 2 days) I responded quite well with the fatigue gone and pain reduced after 2 days. But pain still about 60% so upped it to 15mg.
Pain improved over the next few days down to around 30% started sleeping much better. Not in pain all through the night.
Then I started to become more active. I tried to return to work. I worked 4 hours non stop on my feet. I started to feel really ill. Light headed and my leg muscles felt like jelly. I had a sleep and when I got back up and tried the stairs to go down, the backs of my legs felt like they were trembling
Now 2 days on if I try to stand for more than 30 mins I feel really rough. Today I had to finish an order and I tried to push myself a little futher than I should. Again I felt positively ill. I had pain in my thighs like they were on fire. I got clammy. Hot sweats. Severe headache and pain across my face (cheek bones).
I know I should be resting and not working but I fear I will lose my bussiness.
I was wondering if anyone else has had this?
I am starting to think maybe its not PMR?
Advise please.
Now I have had a sleep the ill part has passed just got muscle soreness now xx

"Hi all,
I've been diagnosed with PMR for about 13 months, and have been on decreasing dosages of prednisone ever since.  I started at 25 mg per day and am now down to 9 mg per day.
For several months, I've noticed that a few of my finger nails had white lines, or even areas of my nails that grew with the propagation of the nail.  Only one or two nails were affected.
But recently, I've noticed an increase.  Now, 6 of the 10 fingers have white areas on the nails and the areas are larger and larger.
I'm wondering if this related to PMR, prednisone usage, or if it a symptom of another underlying issue?
Any ideas?

"  I had been tapering from 13 mg. to 12.5 and actually feeling less pain and fatigue for about one week - yea.  Then my husband had two emergency health issues in less than 2 weeks which caused me great distress (emphasis on the stress). 
Yesterday, out of the blue, I started to get severe pain back in my neck, upper back and shoulders - I haven't had that severe amount of pain since this PMR started last November.  There is no reason that i can think of for the increased pain except the added stress and worry about my husband's condition.
Why does stress cause increased pain?  I really would like to know the scientific reason if there is one. .  the concepty just boggles my mind.
Today I increased my prednisone dose by 1 mg, and that took me back to where the pain was under control, more or less; and my pain has already diminished.  I probably should stay at this higher dose for at least a week - Yes?  Thanks for any comments.

"Still trying to discern if my pain is flare of PMR or tendonitis, bursitis/ or both due to overuse injury in May. My rheumy believes it is not PMR flare because my sed rate etc. is normal. (and also cuz going up to 10 didn't help at all) I am on 5 of Pred and 15 Meloxicam split into two doses q.d.(yes, I know these are contraindicated together)
Pain is pretty bad and often feels like PMR--no shoulder involvement this time--thank god-- but hip flexors, groins, sometimes glutes, often trocanter......I have a pelvis and hip MRI scheduled for next week. My question is: could it be PMR even if labs are normal (if so, why would rheumy think that test is diagnostic?) I guess if MRI shows NOTHING, then we know and I will have to up the dose of Pred. If it shows some polytendonitis then how the heck will we treat this? Eek. I have done everything I've been told to do and then some. I am on an anti inflammatory diet-- no grains, no dairy, no etoh, no sugar-- which is certainly not hurting me but I also don't see an improvement. Prednisone is causing some depression at this point too which feels both biological and also obviously the effect of chronic pain and immobility. I am trying to be resourceful so that I can ask the right questions when I see rheumy 9/6. What would you guys do?

"It's been a while since I posted.  Thinking of each of you daily and hoping you are all doing well as can be expected...
Rhemy wanted me to go on methotrexate.  I declined.  She wanted me to start reducing 1mg of pred every 3 weeks instead of every month due to my history of bad reaction to oral pred.  
So 3 weeks ago I went from 8mg daily (where I was pretty pain free) to 7mg.  Since then...The pain has been horrific in my wrists and shoulders.  I decided to try to push through it.  
Yesterday I went down to 6mg.  Yesterday was awful,,,then I woke up this morning feeling almost ""normal"".  I scrubbed floors, multiple loads of laundry, shopping and overall normal stuff.  It's 9:45 PM and I'm really tired but not feeling like I was hit by a train (like I felt the entire 3 weeks of going from 8mg to 7mg).  
Don't know what tomorrow will bring.  I suspect I will feel the effects of my overdoing it today.

"As a 56 year old female,1 year post menstruation I suddenly experienced severe pain in my hips trying to turn over in the night. Symptoms quickly got worse spreading to my shoulders and upper arms and my joints seemed to be snapping and cracking so bad in the mornings. I thought this was the next stage of the menapause following on from hot flushes and adrenaline surges. I searched the Internet to see if anyone else had experienced these symptoms during menapause and found many posts with similar symptoms. After an appointment with my Gp he suggested I may have poly myalgia and sent me for blood tests. Esr was within normal limits but Crp was raised in double figures. He suggested I start prednisone to confirm diagnosis but I was really reluctant to test the drug as I knew I couldn't just stop taking them and preferred to take ibuprofen which I could adjust according to need. However i was concerned as I ibuprofen was necessary for pain relief at different amounts but at least daily for the previous 6 months ! ( retired nurse with reluctance to take drugs unless absolutely necessary !) I asked the Dr to check my hormone levels and found my  oestrogen levels confirmed menause. After discussion with my Gp he agreed to try low dose Hrt with a follow up in 6 weeks. I definitely felt better without hot flushes and adrenaline rushes, also pain in my hips disappeared, more importantly I was sleeping! However, the pain in my shoulders, upper arms and neck continued ( both sides but more predominant on Left side possibly because I am left handed and use this side more readily) at my follow up visit my Gp tested for rotator cuff compression/tear and I agreed to a one off injection of prednisolone into my shoulder . Day 1 I just wanted to sleep, Day 2 I felt really sick and experienced an episode of blurred peripheral vision, but day 3 I felt good and no pain except in my left shoulder when moving my left arm out to the side and above my head and left Achilles' tendon area. Although it's still early days, my response to prednisolone may support my poly myalgia diagnosis and perhaps offer an alternative medication route, more importantly I am back to taking no tablets at all for pain relief! My follow up is due next week .

"Hello all,
I know attempts to self diagnose are not the best and I'm in the process of seeing a neurologist and will see a rheumatologist (but long wait).
I am so tired of feeling like cr*p for years now, particularly when I'm only 33 years old! I would be very thankful for any time you take to read and answer.
Symptoms
My problems began almost 3 years ago, suddenly, I developed a throbbing right temple headache. The worst headache I had ever had and I could literally feel the throbbing sensation like in a vein. The headaches continued but grew less throbbing and more chronic - but with recurring 'attacks' which floored me.
I then began developing jaw pain, not so much strong pain but more like muscle strain feeling in my right side jaw (same as the headache).
Now two years later my neck is an absolute mess of cracking and sounds like I imagine an 80 year old would sound like. I have very frequent and debilitating neck pain and my shoulders are incredibly sore. I have constant lower back pain, knee pain, muscular pain in my hips and arms frequently also. I have gotten two negative MRIs of my lower back and knee - NOTHING to be seen of disc problems. I do have an disc prolapse in my neck on MRI.
I have also had some balance problems now for 3 months which is why I am seeing a neurologist.
On top of that, and maybe the worst, is the extreme fatigue, feel like I don't sleep and is exhausted all day, I have only a few hours of functioning a day.
I also had some positive ACLA lab results, but don't know if that is related to PMR also.
Neurologists look at MS now and some other neurologists considered Vasculitis.
The worst thing is that despite the headache I was in good shape until this latest 'flare up' about 3 months ago.
Things against PMR?
- Young, male, 33 years old
- Low CRP (but high normal (8+) leukocytes for months)
Does what I describe sound like something you recognize?

I've just had a major flare up which started on my face and quickly migrated to my hands, arms, top of chest and now as we speak, neck and shoulders. I can't find too much on this, but it seems inflammation of blood capillaries in the skin can trigger mast cells to release histamine and that's what causes the hive-like rash.
Does this sound familiar to anyone? Thanks and thanks too for all the really useful pmr postings - I've learnt so much from everyone.

"well, feeling a bit silly now after saying last time how much better I felt. I'm afraid it was very short lived as the fevers I was getting just got worse and Thursday eve my temp was sky high and I couldn't stop shaking worse still I was really struggling to breathe. 
Hubby took me to A&E and they kept me in overnight and put me on  intravenous antibiotics. Had all the tests I had previously! The chest X-ray showed it was pneumonia. They kept asking if I smoked, I said why, do you think it's copd? I told them I didn't, only passive when nursing in mental health in the 80s and 90s. As I can't remember the last time I had a cold and don't get bronchitis all the time they say it's unlikely, still said if symptoms are still there after a month I should have a lung function test. Fingers crossed on that one! Have some much stronger antibiotics now and feel like they're shifting things but won't speak too soon! Still feeling pretty poorly and can't even climb the stairs without feeling weak and dizzy, in fact I really can't do anything. Should have listened to my body long ago, no choice now but things could be a lot worse. At least the pmr is behaving itself! See the GP again next Thursday for original tests. The crp level was 7.9 in hospital not sure whether that's normal or not, only knew my esr was 35 at the beginning. I'm pretty new to all this. Hope I have good news next time I post and I can start reducing from 15 again. Should I do it in 1mg steps or be more drastic? Any advice appreciated thank you.

"I’m celebrating my 18 month birthday of PMR and the longer the time since it occurred, the more fatigue seems to be increasing during my days.
When I was on high doses of my medications during the first year, I didn’t seem to have much fatigue, but now as I have tapered down to 5 mg and the pain levels are OK, I can’t function during the day without one or two quite long naps.
Is this typical for most of us with PMR ? Is it the PMR still not telling the adrenal system how to work properly and messing up the body functions or is it strictly the continuing doses of these medications that we are required to saturate our bodies with ?
I realize that we can never actually ‘cure’ PMR – if we are lucky, it goes into remission for the rest of our lives when we have tapered out of the need for prednisone, but does the fatigue still remain with those in remission ?
I would enjoy reading your reactions to fatigue during active PMR or remission.
Thanks - Dave

"Looking for some advice/support.  I have been following this forum for about a year now - extremely helpful.  I started taking prednisone (15 mg) back in Feb 2012  and reduced down to 4 mg Mar. 2014.  Since then I have  tried 3 times to reduce to 3.5 mg. with no success.  The last 2 times using the reduction schedule from the forum.  This most recent attempt I got all the way to a full week at 3.5 mg, then one morning awaken with those same old pains rearing their ugly head again.  During the week of 3.5 mg I incurred a dog bite to the hand - very painful and put on amoxicillin/clavu for 10 days.  The return of the pmr pain happened almost to the day of ending the antibiotic.  I know this maybe just a coincidence and the relapse would have happened as it did the past two times.   What to do?  Go back to 4.0 and if so for how long before trying to reduce again.  Any suggestions?

"3 weeks ago because my neck and shoulders were not good and my blood counts go up and down between 22 and 40 .I asked a different doctor , as mine was away her advice .
Go back up to 15 mg pred , for 3 days . Then drop to 10 mg and stay at that for 4 week .
The first three days were great , then I went down to 10 mg .Since then my neck and shoulder pain have gone back to bad. . Now i have alwayssuffered from Neuralgia and having a really awful time with that now . My view is that the shoulder pain aggravates the neuralgia .
If any of you were in my shoes would you go back to 15 mg pred for three days then drop slowly as I would by .5 mg every 7 days . I had been on pred starting at 15 mg since November 15 . My Polymialgia trip started then .I had got down to 9.5 before I saw the doctor about the ongoing symptoms . Absolutely in despare, not one doctor advises the same .I see a neurologist in a week , but no doctor will send me to a rhumatolagist . When I ask why I am told the condition will work its self out in two to three years .Come on guys some one cheer me up I know you are good at that Carol

"Hello,  I have been using the DSNS technique and have reduced from 15 mg to 14 mg with no pain or stiffness increas. HOWEVER, now I am the second week of the DSNS taper down from 14 mg. to 13 mg. and I now have an increase in overall aches and stiffness. 
I really hate to increase back to 14 mg (where I felt less pain and stiffness) but think maybe I should.  How long should I wait jat 13 mg just in case my body is trying to get used to the 13 mg dose and the pain/stiffness will go away? I am sure that this advice has been given already, but would appreciate an update.  I have had increased pain/stiffness for about one week now. 
I am anxious to taper down on the prednisone because of the side effects it gives me - nausea, loss of appetite, memory loss, thrush.  If I do go back up to 14 mg, how long should I stay on that amount before I start the DSNS taper to 13 mg again? 
I am frustrated that the DSNS taper may be too fast for me!  I feel discouraged since I have been on 15 mg of prednisone for about 6 monts without a succesful taper any lower than 14 mg. Any advice is appreciated.

"I was diagnosed yesterday by a Rheum with PMR. I'm actually not on board with it. Partly because I don't think he did enough investigating before proclaiming the verdict, and partly because I don't think I fit the parameters. Interested in what PMR veterans have to say.
I have a colorful history of mechanical orthopedic problems. Nasty spondylosis in my neck in the moderate to severe range. Lumbar problems. SI joint dysfunction. All of those mechanical problems create muscle/tendon/ligament and pain problems.
The reason I was sent to the rheum is pain in both hands, both feet, both knees. I have a majority of the tender points for fibro. Fatique. Morning stiffness. Sleep problems but not from pain.
I have a history of Vitamin D deficiency. My ESR was normal but my CRP was elevated (12.2) on the latest round of blood tests. My PCP ran blood tests and I was negative on the ANA, rheumatic factor, Lyme and thyroid.
I don't have shoulder involvement. I think that is where this went off track. I have pain and muscle tightness in my neck and upper back but that can be tracked right back to the cervical spondylosis which gets aggravated by my job which is sitting at a computer all. day. long. I don't have range of motion problems except from the mess in my neck. But the rheum is interpreting my upper back tightness to the PMR.
The SI joint dysfunction creates problems with the IT band and the big muscles moving the hip and thigh. It tightens them up like WHOA but it responds to PT perfectly well. Again, I think the rheum is conflating the orthopedic stuff with PMR symptoms.
I can alleviate the pain symptoms quite handily with Ibuprofen. But they pop back again after I stop taking it. I have a bad history with Prednisone and I am very reluctant to take it as a test to see if there is a marked improvement especially because I can get that marked improvement with Advil. The symptoms I can't account for are the fatique and sleep problems.
Going for a second opinion tomorrow. I actually think this is more fibro + mechanical arthritis than PMR.
Would love to hear some thoughts to help me clarify this in my head.

"The last 2 months I've had tightness in my left buttock while on Prednisone.  For the first while I could walk if off but for the last month it is constantly there but only when I walk, and sometimes shifts to the left leg's inner thigh, the result being I find I'm sort of limping.  Has anyone had something like this?  It could be a disc in the lower back pressing on a nerve affecting the muscles in the buttock and thigh, or maybe it's just muscle weakness resulting from the Prednisone.  I'm in a quandry how to tackle it, see a physio, chiro, massage therapist.   I've found that since I've had PMR 2 years ago anyone working with their hands on me greatly aggravates things so I'm unsure where to turn.  Any suggestions?

"I'm 53, living in Canada, and was diagnosed with PMR over six months ago after living with pain throughout my body for over a year.  I was originally prescribed 40 mg of Prednisone to alleviate my symptoms - and it worked wonderfully!  However, due to an existing medical condition (Diabetes) it became obvious that I could no longer take Prednisone!  So, under my doctor's guidance, the long weaning process began - I reduced x 5 mg every two weeks from 40 mg to 20 mg, then x 2.5 mg from 20 mg to 10 mg and finally x 1 mg from 10 mg to 5 mg, once 5 mg's is reached I will see my physician.  
I am currently at 8 mg and am suffering greatly with, what I believe is withdrawal / weaning pain from Prednisone!
My neck and shoulders burn daily from approximately 2:00 pm onward, until I go to bed - 10:00 pm. I feel generally unwell and am suffering from severe muscle cramps in both my legs!
I'm at a loss as to how to fix this?  Unfortunately, it's not an option for me to ""up"" my Prednisone dosage and was hoping someone on this amazing forum would have some advice for me regarding a natural means to reduce my pain, or at least tell me that what I'm feeling is normal and will go away once I've completely weaned from Prednisone?
I'm not used to feeling unwell and to be perfectly honest I'm tired of feeling this way.  I no longer have half the energy I used to have and feel as though I've become a different person.  
I sincerely apologize to all reading this about sounding whiny.

"I was diagnosed with 'atypical' PMR nearly three years ago. After two years I transferred to a different rheumatology department and was diagnosed with seronegative RA by the new hospital and put on methotrexate (now down to zero on prednisolone). At my last visit, however, the registrar thought my symptoms tallied more with spondylathropathy than RA (the mtx had no effect on buttock and back ache) and arranged a spinal MRI. Three days later he rang and told me there was inflammation in my spine/sacroilliac joints, confirming his suspicion.
Before I leave the group, I thought it might be useful for others with ""atypical"" PMR to see this post, given that it has been posited before that 1 in 6 in this group will turn out not to have PMR but some form of inflammatory arthritis.
My initial symptoms in the acute stage were easily confused with PMR - I woke up one day with the body of an 80 year old: extreme stiffness, inability to bend down and do up my shoes, painful buttocks particularly after getting up from chair or out of car. Night sweats, loss of weight, extreme fatigue. What I didn't really have was any shoulder involvement - though after about a year or so I had impingement in one shoulder which was agony. 
Apart from that, however, I never had any of the extreme, agonising pain that others seem to suffer. I would describe it more as debilitatiing stiffness. As my steroid dosage was reduced, I did have bad backache in my mid spine and at the sacroilliac level, and pain in my hips  most of which had bee masked by the steroids. 
When I was put on 15mg steroids I felt so much better - but it didn't feel 'miraculous' until a couple of days rather than a matter of hours as it was for some on this forum. But in retrospect I wish I had insisted on more tests before committing to long term steroid treatment as they might have picked up the spinal inflammation earlier. I realise now that my rheumatologist's impatience to get me off steroids was not just because the medical profession worry about the side effects but because it would enable an alternative diagnosis. 
Anyway it is in some ways a relief to have a definitive diagnosis - though to be honest I envy those of you with PMR: at least you have the hope of it eventually disappearing!

"Hello everyone,
I've had PMR for 5 months now and after a rocky start, with help from members of this forum things have settled down, being pretty much pain free and coping with a variety of exercise. I am now down to 17mg (from 40!) which I take at 6am and then try to sleep for a couple of hours (this suggestion from Eileen helped enormously) but as I went down to 16mg I have developed a strange pain in my left knee. I had also been doing quite a lot of cycling. The pain comes on at night and feels like a very tender area on the inside of the knee. I can locate the spot just under the skin and about a centimetre in diameter. It can be painful enough to stop me sleeping and I have resorted to ibroprofin which helps a bit.  It's quite hard to walk but the pain usually eases off and can disappear completely later on in the day, with no tenderness to the knee at all. This thing is that I had exactly the same symptoms a few months ago with my other knee, but that went away quite quickly. I'm sure this is something to do with my PMR because if the daily pattern and because it happened before but one does not read much about PMR knee problems. I've reluctantly increased my dose back up to 18 to see whether this makes a difference and also am considering a local cortisone injection (I've had this for both shoulders, which worked well). I'm on holiday at the moment and saw a local doctor about an injection. He suggested I take 16mg at night as well as 16mg in the morning! For obvious reasons I don't want to do that. Compared to so many who are far worse off than me this might seem rather trivial but not sleeping at night because of this is a pain in every sense of the word.

"Eighteen years down the line, a 2nd opinion rheumy has given diagnosis of Takayasu's Arteritis and recognised that I need to reduce from 60mg VERY SLOWLY when I'm stable - no GCA symptoms, blood tests are ""normal"", I'm stress free and feeling very well!
I don't think I've ever had a day like that in years.
So can anyone help with how symptom free does one have to be?
I usually experience niggles of temple pain every day, but nothing like a flare-up or an attack. My scalp can feel senstive one day, then have short stabs of pain the next - but again, nothing like a flare or an attack.
Does this mean that the 60mg Pred hasn't calmed the inflammation enough for me to reduce?
Or would a small 2.5 reduction at this level continue to treat the inflammation?

"Good morning, all, from the USA.  I am 70 and have been diagnosed since January, 2015.  Have been reducing from 20 mg and just recently reduced to 13 mg.  Am very sensitive to prednisone.  So just reduce by 1 mg at a time.  Even though I think my pain and stiffness are fairly well controlled by the prednisone, I walk VERY slowly with a cane, not for long distances, and still am very careful about everything I do.  Most anything seems to result in overuse of my muscles.  I rest or nap one to two times a day.  Recently I have had severe pain in my right groin and cannot raise my leg to get in the car.  Have improvised a way to get in the car without aggravating my groin so much.  Thought it would help the muscle or tendon to heal.  Also had to come up with a new way to get into bed. Has anyone else had this problem?  Is it PMR? It seems some new pain is always cropping up.  Thank you to all and have a great day!  Linda

"Was diagnosed with PMR a couple of years ago.  Have had a couple of flare ups since.  Went back on prenisone and things were better.  This flare up Dr. put me on 20 mgs pred.  Went back a few weeks later and my sed rate was down from 31 to 29 so he said I could start tapering the pred.  Went to 18mg for a couple of weeks.  Now I'm on 16mg.  The way he has me tapering will take several weeks to get done.  Well in the mix of all this I find I have a torn meniscus and will see an orthopedic guy next week.

"Hi all,
I am confused.  I recently read here on this forum that PMR is a form of vasculitis, but when I research vasculitis PMR is not listed as one if its forms.
I can understand why it has been said (on this forum) that vasculitis IS a form of PMR, since vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels -- and of course so is PMR.  But if that's the case, why isn't PMR listed as one of the forms of vasculitis?
I tend to think this is important, since vasculitis can lead to vital organ problems if not properly addressed.  I didn't know I had to be concerned with vital organ problems.  I thought I was dealing primarily with blood vessel inflammation of the legs, shoulders, etc.
I'm confused.

I thought I was doing really well but now it seems every time I have the slightest bit of stress or I overdo things I get really bad flu symptoms, still no pain but burning up, no high temperature but on fire all over! 
Went to G.P yesterday as I had difficulty taking a deep breath especially wakes me up at night (no pain) just bad discomfort. She said I might have a chest infection as my breathing was lrestricted and prescribed amoxicillin, which so far haven't made any difference, I also upped my pred to 12.5 GP said to stick at that but hasn't changed anything.

"Hi all, back during the early part of July I posted detail of my being prescribed Alendronic Acid and your suggestion was to request a DEXA scan. I visited my GP who said 'Yes, but you are alright because you are on Alendronic Acid'. I said, 'No, I am not taking it, until I know if I need it'. My GP's attitude then changed. I was told 'You will need it, your bones will be affected by steroids, you will get fractures, you should be taking it'.
I tried to explain that I have had no fractures, even though I have fallen three times recently in the garden. I then asked if I should have had a test in the beginning to show if I had any bone thinning, the GP said, 'we do not normally give test to anyone over the age of 70 as we expect you to have bone thinning'. The GP was not at all happy at my refusal to take it, repeating to me again and again that I must and should take it. and then, and only then, when filling out the DEXA scan request form, asked me if there was any history of osteoporosis in my family, I said 'no, no one neither my mother, nore my grandmother', then I was asked had I had any fractures,I said 'one, leg fracture twenty years ago'. The GP then said that there would be a two to three month wait for the scan'.
The atmosphere was somewhat unpleasant, I was left feeling a little shaken, and upset.

"Hi Everyone, was diagnosed last November and put on 20mg pred, now down to 10mg but haven't been well since 19th July.  I had some kind of fever and slept for 11.5 hours.  Anyway 2 days later my stomach began to cramp and had diaorrea even after drinking water, was off my food completely.  Now I am just feeling a good bit better but still weak and eating normally now.  Having said that, I am still running to the toilet and have just worked out that it's when I eat bread (it doesn't matter if it's brown or white bread.  All comments welcome and thank you in advance.

"I would just like to share as there is nobody here to talk to.
Having a painful day and unable to get comfortable sitting down or moving around. Had full days pred and dihydrocodeine but seem not to be able to move along.
Frustrated as need to be getting organised for a trip away to see sister and mum. However this is the third day where I have ultimately achieved nothing and am running out of time.

"I was tapering quite nicely and got to 18mg when it went haywire. Went back up to 20, but slowly over a week, my symptoms of temple pain, lethargy and generally feeling unwell, increased.
My rheumatologist is away and I'm due to see a stand in rheumy on Tuesday. However, today, having slept all afternoon and feeling absolutely wretched with fatigue and temple pain, I called my GP to ask for an urgent blood test. As luck would have it, she is away, but the young duty doctor wanted to see me as his last appointment.
I went through the potted history and he has told me to increase to 40mg and has requested an urgent blood test for tomorrow morning.
I'm so fed up being back at 40mg! There is no end in sight at this rate.
Will wait to hear of the blood results tomorrow eve. If they turn out to be ok, the 40mg will have been a terrible increase. If the markers are up, well, who knows I did ask him whether I should wait for the bloods before increasing to 40, but I suppose him being young, he wasn't going to take any chances. On the other hand, I'd rather have a GP who takes the condition seriously unlike my last surgery.

"I will try and be succinct. I am gathering your wisdom and help thinking my situation through before calling my rheumatologist. 
To recap, I originally wrote forum back in May following what I thot was a flare of PMR. At the recommendation of rheumy, I increased Pred. from 2 mg to 12 mg over 2 wks w/o any benefit. (I had been on Pred starting at 10 mg very successfully following initial dx in Nov. 2012) At that point, I asked to be seen in the office.
When I got in to see dr., he dx’ed me with Trochateric bursitis and tendonitis following overuse injury (run through airport). He gave me cortisone shot and five days on Indocin (NSAID) Blood work was normal. My improvement was pretty dramatic.
I have reduced back down to 5 mg. Pred and remain on 15 mg qd of Meloxicam. Pred is for PMR and Melixicam (Mobic) is for the tendonitis. They are not two drugs I want to take at the same time for very long and I do have some GI complaints. My dr. concurs but for now I need both.
So, my sx have worsened in the past two weeks or so. I was at the lake on vacation. The location of pain seems to be sometimes trochanter, always hip flexors, groins, occasionally glutes. I am functionally quite impaired, can't exercise, walk with out peculiar rolling gait, etc. You all know the story.  Sometimes I feel like my legs are full of sand (heavy and “logey”) I attribute this to Pred but it may be PMR.
My goal is to know for sure what we are treating. If it’s a PMR flare, I could up the Pred. If it is not, I’d like to stay at 5 or reduce and treat tendonitis more aggressively. I see three possible action steps. 1) get more blood work done 2) Try Indocin again for 5 days and see if we can knock out inflammation 3) weight bearing hip x ray to see if Osteo arthritis is involved much. I know I have some.  What am I missing? Does this make sense? 
As always, thank you for your help. All thots welcome. Gail

"Has anyone on this forum any experience with gout (family or friends)?
Went to my own doctor yesterday and HE doesn't think I have RA.  (Reumy just looked at my swollen ankles and said RA)!!
Years and years ago I had a swollen big toe, very painful, couldn't walk properly for weeks.  Then it cleared up.
At the moment uric acid level is 6 - 7.  Pain in both ankles often excruciating.
Have googled gout and will start diet asap.  Gout forum not particularly helpful.
I know this isn't the right forum for this, but just thought someone may have come across it in family.
Views would be gratefully appreciated.

"Hi everyone,
I'm interested in hearing from people who split their pred dose.
I find I'm really struggling in the mornings - I'm tired, unmotivated, depressed, negative - CRANKY (lol). I've also noticed that when the pred does kick in after a few hours I'm almost manic - it takes half a day for me to settle down enough to concentrate at work (just in time to go home for the day!).
The last couple of nights I've taken 1mg when I went to bed and I've woken up feeling much better - not so tired and definitely not so negative about life in general.
I'm just wondering if I might be better off if I split my dose completely in half to try and smooth out the ups and downs.
I'm currently on 13mg a day, reducing to 12.5mg.
I already sleep badly, with lots of night sweats, so the idea of sleeping badly isn't that much of a deterrent.

However several days ago I developed severe pain in my buttock and right down my left leg - presumably sciatica and wonder if this can be in any way connected to the PMR?

"Hi everyone,
My GP put me on a month's sick leave from work and I took the 'opportunity' to go offline almost completely. I started back at work yesterday.
Thrilled to report that three days after I started leave I felt AMAZING!
Now the question is - it because I wasn't at work or because I was doing stuff that I enjoyed and therefore not focussing on how poorly I was feeling?
I've been able to work like a trojan painting and renovating (a house we have been renting out and are now selling). I did pace myself a little, but still managed full day/s of physical activity followed by a rest day.
I wonder if it's because I have an office job and sitting on my butt all day isn't good for the pain/fatigue. Who knows.
Whatever, I'm just grateful I feel so well at the moment. Started reducing my pred again - down to 14mg and feeling pretty smug again. lol

"Just recieved a note from my GP telling me to come in for my 6 monthly Prolia injection.
I've previously raised the possible link between Prolia (denosumab) for osteoporosis and autoimmune disease on this forum. I'm becomming even more convinced it could be likely.
Is it a coincidence I am just starting to feel better than I have since diagnosis 8 months ago?
- Is it the month off work I just had?
- Is my PMR going into remisssion after only 8 months?
- Or could it be that the Prolia is wearing off ?
Is it a coincidence that i only got sick after I had my first Prolia injection?
Side effects of Prolia include (and yes I'm pulling out all the relevant ones):
- back pain
- pain in the arms and legs
- bone, joint and muscle pain
- weakened/impaired immune system
- fatigue

"Can you  to help others just like you, who are on this journey that nobody ever willingly undertakes.
A Support Group for people with PMR and GCA is looking for Volunteers to help it keep going.  It is located in Cambridge.
 It has been operating for nearly three years, but needs help like yesterday.
Volunteering does not mean you have to work a 40 hour week, more like perhaps 2 or 3 hours.  With meetings currently twice a year.  Some of the members also meet informally, monthly for a coffee and a chat, but you go if you want.
 You do not need to have a special skill, but if you can do basic book-keeping – brilliant.  Perhaps you were an accountant when you were working.
 If you can keep a register of members - all to the good.  Nearly everybody can keep an alphabetical list of names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses.
If you are willing to take the occasional telephone call –  a patient or carer looking for help  - OK you won’t know everything – but you will know where to find out.
If you have any skills into pulling an informal newsletter together – wow.
I know, from experience, that most of you think – or I will be no good at that sort of thing, but hey – how do you know till you try.  You all have experience with computers, otherwise you would not be here reading this post.
I never thought that at 69 I would end up helping to start a support group, but 3 of us did.  Two with PMR and one with GCA.   All silver surfers.  Now 77 and still going strong and yes, we found more people to help, so 6 of us, plus two tea ladies, two raffle sellers and two ladies who keep the record for those attending meetings (record need for Health and Safety) just in case we have to evacuate the building and can count heads.  .
All the volunteers and  have made new friends. 
So, if you are in the Cambridge Area and feel, Yes I could help out,  the more the merrier and the lighten the load and keep it going.
 Send me a PM and I will respond.
PS I looked for an Optimist emoticon - there isn't one. grrrrr

Since last July I've been on 60 mgs daily for 7 months, 50 mgs for a couple of months and trying to reduce for the rest of the y
I get so far & the symptoms return.
Each attempt to reduce has been slower than the one before and the best i've achieved was 44mgs a couple of weeks ago.
Then I had to have an emergency root canal on a wisdom tooth & that was followed by a return of symptoms!
After waiting for 4/5 days to see if this really is a flare up & following discussion with 2 very supportive Gps at my surgery, I agreed I should up the Pred for a bit to 46mg. ( the last dose that held the symptoms in check)
After a week there was little  improvement and we agreed that I should go back up to 50mgs.
After 2 weeks,on 50mgs there is still no improvement
ESR started to rise slowly 2 weeks ago from 5 to 14, then 16,.2 days later on a repeat blood test ,CRP remained normal at 4.
Another week later (today), ESR is 26, CRP is still 4.
Symptoms bearable but present.
I think this flare is unresponsive to the 50mgs & I may have to go back to the begiinning again at 60.
Have I got this right? Has anyone else experienced this kind of difficulty?

"Recently, a new doctor, over the telephone, without ever having seen me, and whist making out a prescription for Prednisolone for which I had requested, added to that prescription Alendronic Acid. The detail accompanying the prescription told me to take each 70mg dose one each week.
I have been treated for PMR for the past 3 years, currently on 6mg, reducing very slowly as I can down to 5mg, my next target.
Can anyone offer any suggestions as to what considerations needs to be thought about before I begin this medication. I do not, as far as I am aware, ever suffered from osteoporosis, and there has not been any osteoporosis in my family.
On checking with my regular doctor once again per telephone, she advised me to take it, although she herself had not ever in the past thought to prescribe this medication for me. I ask if tests I could take that would indicate the need for this medication and she said ""NO"".
I consider myself fairly fit, I am 74 years of age, I weigh 8 1/2 stone. and am very careful with diet, although, I have found it difficult to take calcium supliments, having had an allergic reaction. Thank you, anyone!

"Just prior to taking prednisone my heel (underside and center of heel) starting hurting me. Before that at night both heels would feel uncomfortably tender. 
The myofacial therapist I have seen said maybe my arch was falling relative to the first problem and probably I should make sure not to tuck the sheet and blankets under the mattress to avoid putting pressure on my feet. She said  maybe I needed an arthopedic insert for my shoe and go see a podiatrist which I haven't done.
However, the problem has diminished as I continue to take the prednisone.
Has anyone else had these kinds of foot tenderness issues?

"Have any of you had experience with using hookworm to dampen the autoimmune system and reduce the symptoms of PMR?  Evidence seems to be accumulating on the effectiveness of this in treating other autoimmune disorders.
When I was first diagnosed, I assumed I’d have to take some prednisone for months or years and everything would be dandy.  However, based on the experiences of those on this forum, and my own overwhelming fatigue, I am getting less optimistic.  I would welcome a few intestinal fellow travelers if this would allow me to avoid both chronic inflammation and the side effects of long-term use of prednisone.
For information on this, you can google “hookworm” and “autoimmune,” or look for the program on parasites.
I’d really appreciate any information anyone might share on using this approach for PMR.  Thanks!

"Has anyone had any experience with deep muscle manipulation therapy known as myofacial therapy?
At the onset of my symptoms, I had such treatment. It seemed to help but the effects didn't last long. The treatment is painful but the goal is to release knotted up muscles.
Recently I had a session hoping to clear up the muscles in my leg that were making me limp so badly that I was about to use a cane. Then I got a new rheumatologist, diagnosis & prednisone. I'm pretty sure the meds cleared up the leg problem. Thoughts?

"I'm new to PMR and this very helpful forum. I understand now what a huge range of conditions PMR suffers have thanks to this forum.
My PMR diagnosis was just confirmed in early July after getting symptoms in Nov 2014 and going from doctor to doctor. I thought I had Lyme Disease.
Before symptoms hit, I had a regular daily routine of stretching, yoga postures, light weight lifting. I need to lift weights because I also have osteoporosis. I also walked 45-60 minutes most days and occasionally went swing dancing. I'm 68 but have those genes that make me look and feel lots younger.
My chiropracter and husband are driving me nuts saying use it or lose it but my physical therapist and new rheumotologist (3rd one and she is good) say don't overdo, just do what you can. 
I can see from the forum my situation is not so bad but I need help getting focused on how to exercise so I don't end up with what seemed like pulled mulscles in my leg like I had just before I started prednisone. It got so bad, I was thinking I needed a cane. Now I'm moving around fluidly but when I get tired, I start limping.

"Hi I havent been on the forum for a while as it is so hard to try and cope with PMR and work full time and having a stressful time to boot!!!!
Anyway I am sorry to bother you all out there but wondered if any one can give me any experiences they may have had from taking magnesium malate.
I have bowens therpy regularly - thank goodness a complete god send and I would recommend this to everyone who has PMR - but only last week my therapist advised me to try magneium supplements in my diet but when I have researched this there are so many different types.
I think it is Magnesium Malate I need not just for my PMR pain( which is quite under control at moment - taking 7mg prednislone at mo and not reducing at all due to all stress I have at mo) but I also have a lot of back pain and find walking very difficult at the moment I am also sleeping very badly and have so much fatique it is getting boring lol
Dont know if it is relative but despite eating very healthily - plenty of fresh veg and meat I just cannot loose weight and am quite swollen - also dont know if this is relative but I have just had to have my blood pressure tablet doasage increased due to having high blood pressure.
Sorry to sound such a mess but just wondered if anyone could give me some advice.
Thanks for your time in advance x

"I am a 70 year old male. I developed GCA in early November 2013. In May of 2014 I had a relapse with vision loss.
In May of this year, my ophthalmologist recommended that I have an A1C test because my retina had a shadow on it. I had the test last week and the result was 5.8 which means that I am a border line diabetic. My Mean Blood Glucose was 118mg/dl and I had not had anything to eat for 10 hours. The A1C test measures your average blood sugar over a 2 or 3 month period.
My questions to you are:
   1. Have you had an A1C test?
   2. Have you had an ophthalmologist examine your eyes.
Using excel I routinely chart the following values, the figures below are monthly averages. I believed they were good for a person my age and gender.
MNT SYS  DIA    BPM      WGT. CRP   PRED        BMI
Apr      122      75      70    188.0     4.6.   9
May      118      72      72    188.0    3.8.   8
June     116      73      73    186.4.   4.6    7
July     116.      73      73    186.4.   1.9.   6.        23 measured
I have returned to a strict low carb way of eating. As for pred reduction, I droped .5mg every two weeks during the 4 months listed above. Unlike people with PMR I start suffering aches in the eyes and temples areas when the pred dose is not enough. I spent most of June in England, Wales and Scotland and had to increace the dose by 2mg for the first two days. The weather was the same as Colorado Springs and Atlanta. Cloudy and Overcast.

Also I have been unable to complete a routine smear test Four times because of internal muscle pain.
The last attempt I was prescribed valium to relax me  but  still when it came to the crunch I begged the nurse to stop. Just after this, I fell into PMR agony especially in the pelvis and groin.

This morning when I got up, the outer side of my left thigh was a bit sore.  It is still sore or should I say an ache and sometimes it's throbbing.  I haven't taken any pain relief yet.  Could this be the beginning of a flare or withdrawel from pred.  If it is a flare, would it be both my thigh muscles?  When I am out walking (which is not that often) it's always my left calf muscle that pulls and I have to turn back.  All comments welcome and thank you in advance.

Went to dentist to have bi-annual teeth cleaning and usually I'm am complimented on how good my teeth look.  This time she said I had a lot of plaque! Asked if I have dry mouth?  I didn't think so, but I told her my nose is always dry now thanks to Prednisone.  She said many medications cause dry mouth and said I better brush my teeth 3 times a day, drink lots of water!!  I could easily get decay, infections, and more.  WOW!!!  Thanks Prednisone!

"Does PMR/GCA occur mostly in light complected people/blond hair blue eyes?
Could it be  that light complected people for some reason are more at risk not because of their ancestry but just because they are light complected and of course their ancestry would also be a contributing factor.
Does it occur in all races?
Here in the States we are mostly a bit of everything.  I remember being the only kid all through school with light blond hair and blue eyes and neither my mom or dad or any relative had my coloring except for one sister and brother who had brown eyes. 
i myself have light blond hair, light skin and blue eyes.

"Hello again. I know I have already posted today about a different subject but as the one query has nothing  to do with the other I thought I would be greedy and do two! Right, I have been getting severe pain on the top of my right hip bone. It feels like it is badly bruised (it isn't). It is at it's worst when I get up after sitting for any length of time (half an hour or more). It then wears off after walking for a few minutes. Does anyone recognise this as part of their PMR pain or is it something unrelated? I am due to get an appointment for a dexa scan any day so maybe this will show what is up. I am also getting dreadful knee pain at times which the rheumi thinks is osteo-arthritis although I think it feels more like nerve pain. I am having an x-ray on this tomorrow. When this is bad I can't walk for about ten minutes, then it eases up and is ok to put my weight on.
I went for my second gastroscopy yesterday (first one showed severe oesophagitis and an ulcer). Good news is, the ulcer is gone. Bad news is, it was caused by a 'sliding haiatus hernia' which was hiding under all the inflamation! Anyone else got this? Apparently that is what is causing the gastric reflux disease. Not sure if this is down to the preds or just a coincidence that I got it just after starting them (Jan '14). Sorry if this post sounds a bit confused and rambling but to be honest that's how I'm feeling at the moment! Take care everybody, Debbie

"Hi everyone. May I ask. how many of you if any, have lost weight while on steroids, with the slimming world diet? I have now been sticking to this 'food optimising' for two weeks and have only lost 1lb! I realised that I wouldn't lose tons like non pred taking people but am extremely disappointed all the same.
Now my query is that this diet contains quite high carb consumption. You are told to fill up on potatoes, rice and pasta as well as meat and loads of fruit and veg. As we all know, a low carb diet is more pred friendly so I wondered if this is why I havn't lost weight? Trouble is, I find it is the easiest diet I have ever been on! I have checked and double checked that I am 'doing it correctly' and I am, however I am never hungry. The only thing I miss is a sandwich (bread is very restricted) and cornflakes which are very high in 'syns'!  I am hoping that if I stick with it, the weight loss will kick in sooner or later! Any thoughts gratefully received. Hope you are all having a 'good' day, Debbie

"Hello! I have just had my first experience of PMR...or so GP diagnosed. Over a couple of days, I developed muscle pain pain PAIN equalily on both sides my buttocks, groin, hips and thighs and bascially what I would call my ""undercarriage"" altogether!! Also my upper arms and shoulders.
Pain increased and i could barely walk, sit, bend.etc...
We suspected it was Fibromyalgia and was given tramadol and pregabalin, which had little effect.
Then GP gave me blood tests and results said that I had a very high indicator of muscle inflammation and the symtoms convinced her that it was PMR.
Was given Pred. prescription and the pain dissipated blissfully. Two weeks later am still on pred but can feel the ""saddle-soreness"" returning.
GP said it was unusual for a woman of 46 to get PMR but not unheard of.
Can any of you wise people help me?

Is it due to a lack of clear diagnosis and treatment? Is it due to threatening disability that causes anxiety and depression? Is it poor sleep and tiredness which is attributed to Prednisolone? Is it the difficulty of a definite dosage titration to prevent ups and downs of the illness process? Is it the doctors who can be inadequate, scornful or rude? Is it that the action of the prednisolone itself causes increased stress responses which have a knock on effect?
If you have any ideas about this, it is useful to share them because many of the above, and other suggestions equally as possible, can be addressed.

I am a relatively well built, 67-year-old male whose weight is somewhat normal (but redistributing).  I've been on prednisone for about a year, and amongst other noticeable symptoms I know am developing man boobs.
Is this caused by the the prednisone or something else?
Ahhhhhhh!

"Thought I'd ask since Ann mentioned on another post, and we can have some ideas from all consolidated here.
I enjoy words by a Eckhart Tolle, live in the now... He also says we are not the pain... And much more, I highly recommend his reading and videos.
However, my ego and conscious takes over and I forget his wise words of living.
oh! I heard a good one...instead of ""be happy""... When in pain, yeah, no... But ""be Happiness""... Puts another spin on a mind set.

"Hi, am not long back from drs.  New dr., my own gp has left.  I started pred on 12th November last at 20mg pred.  I have been reducing very gradual from that period and was at 10mg on 1st June.  Was told by  new gp today that I must reduce 1mg per month.  I was not a happy bunny so we agreed that I would reduce 1mg every 6 weeks instead of 1 month.  Apparantely Consultant Rheumy who is ""an expert""  and the medical profession knows best and (my words) I should do as I'm told.  I am fit to be tied.  Had PMR undiagnosed this time last year or maybe before that but was only diagnosed on 12th November and have had no flares so far.  All comments welcome and Thank you in advance.

"Hi all.  I have a dear friend who is 77, and some years she had PMR in the worst way.  The dr (who is also mine) said she had the highest SED rate he'd ever seen.  She went on Pred. and gradually came down to 5 mg.  She also started eating non inflammatory diet and gluten free diet.  Well, I'm 100 pounds heavier than she is, and I eat fairly healthily (but can hardly exercise), and the PMR won't go down even on 19 mg, which I've tried to get used to this past month with the ""dead slow"" method you have.  I'm still in pain in my arms and shoulder too too much.
Anyway she called the other day and gave me a lecture on giving up milk, bread, etc. and told me ""you won't get well until you try.""  Is it really that successful - the diet - or is she just lucky?  
Besides PMR I have fibromyalgia, major depression, and arthritis.

"Or is it the other way...two steps forward and one (tumbling) step back?
Just a warning, and a little moan.
Saturday I walked around the shops. By the end of an hour, my right foot was painful, but I made it back. Sunday, we decided to do a gentle Nordic walking for about half an hour or so. Fifteen minutes into this gentle amble, my right heel became really painful and we turned back. I was struggling badly with the pain in my heel by then. By the time we got home, I was unable to put pressure on my foot.
I spent the weekend crawling on my knees to get anywhere, as the pain was excruciating.
Monday I had to go to the surgery to have a BP monitor fitted, unconnected to the heel. I struggled in with the help of husband. The next morning, today, I managed to get appointment with GP before BP monitor was removed.
She diagnosed Plantar Fascilitis, ie inflammation of the ligament in your foot, in the underneath of my foot.
The reason I'm posting this, apart from feeling sorry for myself, is that it can be caused by exercise in people who do little or who are overweight, just like me at the moment and particularly in people over 50 or so.
The pain is bad, but the exercises I was told to do have certainly helped and even after one day of exercising my foot, I'm feeling better and don't fall over with the pain like I did last night getting out of bed to go to the toilet!
So, beware! Exercise gently and wear suitable supportive shoes. I've now got some gel supports in mine.

"I am skeptical.  For example, cataracts are due to age.  Mine had nothing to do with prednisone.   I have had thin skin for 20 years at least.  Every medication out there causes gastro-intestinal problems.  Crankiness and irritation may be due to age and feeling horrid.
      The trouble is you can't test prednisone because it is the only treatment for PMR.  There are no good controls.  One of the biggest problems of medical research is that once a treatment becomes the ""gold"" standard, it is unethical to not treat.  For example, if triple bypass surgery or hernia surgery is the standard, you cannot withhold that treatment just because you want to do a study.
      I have just been reading a bunch of really lousy studies that claim there is an adverse event dose response for prednisone, that the higher doses of prednisone cause more and more severe side effects.  These studies just brush off the confounding factor that higher doses of prednisone are given for more serious disease.  Consequently there is not way to distinguish underlying disease and the prednisone dose.
     So those fancy meta-analyses, confidence intervals, etc.,  mean absolutely nothing!
     Yes prednisone may cause severe side effects, but we just don't know.

 repair duly carried out painlessly, I'm not in too much pain from the dentistry, but have new pain - face/sinuses/ears/headache/eyes - possibly from the dentistry, but maybe a GCA reaction to the ""trauma"". I'm taking Co-codamol for a couple of days on Dentist's a\dvice.

"for the past year i have suffered severe pain and stiffness in my upper legs, thighs and upper arms. i have been referred to a rheumatology and hav at last got an appointment for july. my Dr repeatedly gave me pain killers of all description which rendered me unconcious most of the time. my husband had to do everything for me and i felt so bad i thought about  suicide. i did not feel comfortable telling the Dr this but in hindsight it was when the Dr   actually seem to take me seriouslly . at first she thought it was fibromialga but looking on this site i realise people with this had good periods and bad periods .i only had bad periods and it never gave up. i then said to the Dr who thought it could be pmr and after blood tests she agreed to check out with the hosp cosultant  who agreed to let me have prednisalone. i got the tablets on friday and  overnight a miracle occurred, from my husband getting me in and out of bed, up and down of chairs, washing my hair under the shower, drying and dressing me,  to me  getting up showering and dressed, going out and walking going for lunch and some shopping.  I  felt so elated I cried when I met people I knew, telling them of the miracle . I was started on 15 gr after 3 weeks my Dr reduced it to 12.5g  I noticed the drop I felt more pain and stiffness than when on 15. Last week she dropped me to 11g I am still stiff and sore but manageable. However I do have horrendous sweating and can be very tired. I thought I could put up with this as it is preferable to what I had before but it is horrendous, I am soaking wet, feel like my whole body is on fire and yet my skin is really cold. Is this normal and is there anything that will help and is the Dr reducing at a proper rate as it scares me to go back  to were I was 2 months ago. This is the first time I have gone onto a forum so I beg forgiveness if I make mistakes. I don’t know if I get messages back or not so here goes and thankyou in advance to any one who can give me any advice .ps I am going away for week end first break for a year so I might not be able to respond  till mon xx

Next doctor visit is the neurologist to discuss my expanding peripheral neuropathy, which is now beyond my head and face to my tongue, mouth and legs. Not sure the cause, but noticed it a week or so after biopsy for GCA.
I did get a clean bill of health from my dentist whom I visit every 4 months now. He says my teeth are fabulous. They should be since I brush them 2x every day, 5 min each time with a sonic tooth brush, then floss. Totally freaked out about what all these meds are doing to my teeth: Prednisone, LMWH, gabapentin, you name it, i'm on it.  It was nice to go to a doc and hear good news for a change. 
oh the fun of it all. It made celebrating my 54th birthday so much fun, lol. I did get a panini maker from hubby and kid, which was totally cool. Even though I only eat solid food for dinner (and can barely taste anything due to the neuropathy) I did want a panini maker and it's totally cool. they should be government subsidized :D.

"Hi all, haven't been on for a while as we have had a few small problems unrelated to PMR etc. Over the past 9 months I have tried to reduce preds from a high of 25mg and am currently at 13.5mg (now 3 weeks since my drop from 14mg). The itching etc that I was getting every 4 to 6 weeks has stopped completely which is great, but once I dropped below 15mg the aches in my upper arms and lower legs have increased significantly and I am now scared to drop any further. I wouldn't say that it was painful but I now find it difficult to raise my arms above my head and I find walking makes me much more tired. I have been dropping by 0.5 per month for the past 3 months and was ok at 15mg althought I had the odd ache here and there, so can anyone advise if this is normal or should I simply stay at 13.5mg for a few months and see how things go

"This is my first message on this forum, although I have been reading it for a while and greatly appreciating the wisdom on the forum, especially from the wonderful Eileen!
I am 59 and was diagnosed with PMR a couple of months ago, having had the usual symptoms for a couple of weeks. At first, sciatica was suspected (only one leg was affected)  and I had an MRI, then I got the painful shoulders, particularly at night.. After resarch on the internet I went to my GP and told him I was sure I had PMR. As both my CRP and VS were raised and my symptoms were pretty typical, he agreed and immediately gave me an injection of Prednisone and then put me on 40mg. By the time I saw a Rheumatologist I was down to 25mg (reduction of 5g every three days). I was usually pretty stiff and sore in the mornings until about midday and then onwards could function reasonably for the rest of the day. He put me down to 20mg and gave a tapering programme. However, I had a nasty flair up and my GP put me back on 40mg and I started all over again. Things settled down ( still stiff and painful in mornings - some worse than others) and I got down to 20mg when I saw the Rheumy last week. He was concerned about still being on a high dose and wants me to start on Methotrexat to work with the Prednosone to try and get the dose down. . I see very ltttle about this drug on the forum. My GP was not keen on this as he said that Methotrexate was another powerful drug and he suggested that I try and reduce Prednisone first from 20mg and if this does not work go on to the Methotrexate . I have tried to go down to 17.5mg but symptoms are worse - painful right shoulder at night and . I have particular problems with right shoulder and right knee and odly the trigger finger on one hand. Aslo the inside of my knee feels bruised - skin is tender to touch. My Rhemy says my symptoms are not typical and maybe I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. This is because I have problems with my knees in the morning - flexing making walking slow and painful and I only have problem with one shoulder. However, I see on this forum that there are many varied symptoms of PMR. Like many, I had an active life before all of this. I live in Switzerland and am a Swiss mountain guide. I am a teacher as well but have been off work since all of this started.. My Rheymy also suggested acortisone injections into the troublesome joints. Any advice on the Methotrexate, injections and whether my increased symptoms are prednisone withdrawal or PMR?
Thanks

Would be very interested to know if this loss of focus/ dizziness is typical, induced by pred.  or by the PMR .  Its disconcerting !

"i have been recently diagnosed with PMR and for the past couple of  weeks I  have been having sporatic mild headaches mostly on one side of my head.  Two rheumatologists were not overly concerned and the latest referred me to a neurologist for further evaluation however he  will be watching it closely.  
For those of you with GCA what were your first symptoms?
thanks.

"Hello to all. I haven't been on this site for awhile due to some horrific side effects of preds. I would like to ask you all some questions if you don't mind. I I thought for awhile I had gotten some relief from the shakes the dizziness and anxirty. The feelings I can t breathe and just some wierd things. As I post this I am shaling 
so badly and feel as if I could scream or just run or just die. For a little while most of it subsided now it came back with a vengeance. Is this normal??? When I stand I feel as if I will faint. Monday is my day for tapering down. I hope this calms somewhat but afraid it will not. I am sorry If I sound weak but right now I am in one panic mode but I stay that way even in my sleep. Please if you could help me. Thanks in advance,

"I was diagnosed with PMR in December 2014 and am now tapering off of prednisone.  (I started with 40 mg and am now at 6mg/day.)  I have had a couple of mild flares which sent me back up to 10 mg and then back to tapering from there.  For the most part, i think I am doing pretty well.  My most recent sed rate was 19--down from >100--and my CRP was 9--down from 44.  My problem now is intermittent, profuse head and face sweating.  I have scanned past threads for information but as most threads are wont to do, they get tangled in other important discussions.  Is this something many of you have experienced?  WebMD says it is a ""rare"" side effect.  Has anyone discovered anything to relieve it?  (Other than wearing ice packs to garden!)  I am 66 and otherwise relatively healthy.  Thanks in advance.

Good news, I have a  new Rheumatologist in Orlando who lists PMR as his number 1 specialty.  I had been to him several years ago for my knee which is good because he is not accepting new patients.  Also, right before I called they had a cancellation for tomorrow.  Otherwise next appt. Is October.

"i self diagnosed after I was told by rheumatologist in Florida almost a year ago that there was nothing he could do for me and referred me to a pain management doctor.  Long story short and 7 months later when I returned to him after a blood work up he admitted when I saw him the first time I probably had the beginning of PMR.
i can't seem to find a doctor either GP or rheumatologist familiar with this condition.
i started on Prednisone 20 mg about three months ago.  Overnight I became a new person.  I felt wonderful.  In a matter of two months I gradually went down to 10 mg. where I was not great but OK. When I went to 9 I had a flareup and was put back on 20 mg for two weeks- then dropped to 15 for a couple weeks.  When I went back to 10 after two days the fatigue and lower back pain returned but no discomfort in my upper body.  
Its a weekend so I put myself back to 12 and 13 with no results.
in the meantime I developed a mild UTI and got meds for that at walk in clinic.
im thinking about increasing to 15 to relieve the pain because the last time I had this problem and called rheumatologist his nurse told me to go to 20 but he later told me that he didn't believe it was a PMR flareup but something else perhap because the pain was only in my lower back, groin and thighs and
this time the pain is in the same area.
i would like to know if the flareup can strikethe lower body which is where it originally.  
Also the rheumatologist originally told me the feeling of fatigue is not a symptom of PMR.  My GP knows even less.
id just like to share this experience with those who understand.

"Firstly thank you all for your support and for the words of wisdom  you send to other sufferers.  The occipital headaches I have had every day, worse in the morning, for the last two years vanished a week ago. 
I started taking the pred at night, against my docs wishes as he said I would be hyper with it - never any sign of this for me, and over time they are gone.  I have been taking my pred at night for 3 weeks now and the difference is amaging.  I do have temper flares but no worse I think than before, frustration at not doing the things I want to do and could do before, and they pass quite quickly.
Many days I was unable to function without zomiltripan to bring the 'migraine' type headache undercontrol and usualy the pain would last 4 to 5 days and started to be back to back with one day relief inbetween.  Over the past week I have had a 'normal' for want of a better word frontal headache due to stress.
I feel that the inside of my body has loosend up to and I am able to bend and cross my leg over my knee, that is a milestone for me.  And though I am dizzy and liable to fall anyway the pred hasn't made it worse.
I see my specialist tomorrow and I hope the bloodwork is good.  Just wanted to share my good fortune and the importance of keeping a diary of your conditions.
Love to you all

"I have just turned seventy years old,  and had PMR for roughly two years, and manage quite well. My biggest problem, and it really is a problem is that I have absolutely no energy at all. I waken about 6am, and for the first hour I feel fine, and active, but go down hill quickly. I don't even feel like going out either to shop or visit my friends. I get my shopping on line, and would rather email, than visit people.
I am just tired constantly, and although have some aches, I am not in pain.
Does anyone else feel like this? I would just love to feel like doing something.

I'm relieved to know that hands and feet can be affected, as that's not something that is in the leaflet from Drs and mine have bee sore for 2 years! Do you know if the length of time being ill equates to the length of recovery time? I've been going back and fore to the Drs for 2 years and since last september practically ever other week as I was very nearly crippled. I was at my wits end because I know they thought I was a bit neurotic, eventually I asked for a copy of my medical notes and before I had a chance to study them properly a locum Dr listened to my symptoms from top to toe and said PMR.
My next appointment is on Friday so I'll try and pluck up courage and ask for an increase to 20mg as you suggest it may be needed since I work in a shop and it's quite exhausting at times.

"This forum has been a godsend for me. Was diagnosed with PMR, May 2014. GP was wonderful in diagnosis. However, in March of 2015 I reduced too quickly. Right hand pain hit me so bad I had constant throbbing. Went to 40mg Predisone and it got rid of constant pain. Some aches when using-not bad. When to new rheumatologist. Sent me for blood work and lots of X-rays. Found no arthritis. He immediately wanted to put me on Methotrexate to get me off Predisone. Picked up the perscription and first line in information said ""warning-side effects my be fatal"". Doesn't say that with Predisone. Read forum and decided to follow ""dead slow "" reduction instead. I'm on 20mg, 10 mg am and 10mg pm. Four days ago I took 10mg am and 7.5 mg pm, and now 10, 10 for three more days. Question? After this how should I reduce. 7.5 mg am or just work on pm reduction? By how much? 
Dont know what I would have this without your help. Would probably have had hand surgery if I hadn't read that hand pain happened with other PMR sufferers. Have a little hand pain? One 200mg ibuprofen and I can play golf and tennis with no problem.Thanks again

"It is my understanding that the ""stress"" hormone cortisol regulates the body's immune response, preventing the sort of over-activity that is PMR.
 That said, and knowing that prednisone mimic's cortisol's regulating effect (taking over this function in fact), what might we conclude about the the root causes of what would seem like a simple case of inadequate cortisol production?
Could it be that too much cortisol-producing stress causes the sort of glandular insufficiency that sometimes afflicts the adrenal glands (adrenaline) and pancreas (insulin)?
Having just learned that this cortisol is produced by the adrenals (in response to ACTH production by the pituitary), this has me wondering how much that a crtisol insufficiency (as associated with consumption of caffeine and sugar btw) is related to PMR?
I'm thinking that there is perhaps a 1:1 relationship here, and with the fatigue aspect of PMR being the adrenal side of it, and with the cortisol-producing function of the adrenals being the other side of it.
I plan some alteration of my caffene and sugar intakes, noting that my onset of PMR concided with what were (and are) lifetime highs of caffeine consumption for me, yet surely there are other things that can effect the adrenals in their production of both cortisol and adrenaline, and so also worthy of study.
And to think that, at one point, I was increasing my caffeine uptake in order to combat my feelings of fatigue!
Opinions, anyone?

" My left buttock area has become increasingly stiff in the last 2 weeks and after a downhill walk yesterday I'm hobbling like an old man!  I've been on Pred for 2 years for PMR and at 10 mg for about 2 months and unable to come down.  I've mentioned this before and had hoped things would settle enough to go lower but in the last 2 weeks the stiffness went into the buttocks/hip area, especially the left buttock.  It has gradually grew stiffer each day and last night a 4 block walk with my wife in a hilly part of town caused me real discomfor and sure enough today I'm hobbling like an old man.  I want to immediately increase my Pred as this appears to be a classic sign of a flareup.  I figure I'll go slowly increasing it to 12mg then if need be increase it 1 mg a day until I hopefully see a lessening of symptoms.  If the discomfort is growing worse I'll consider jumping it quickly to 15 if not higher.  From there I figure the 'dead slow approach' will be instituted.  Any advice?  Had you had a similar flareup?

"My gp diagnosed me with PMR about 5 months ago. I started on 20mg and after a month went onto 15mg. The problem is that I am in almost as much pain now as I was pre pred. The pain has grgradually increased over the last 3 weeks or so. I am having monthly blood tests and my gp said that my esr has only come down slightly. The pred has also caused a huge increase in my blood sugars and although my meds are being increased almost weekly there has been very little improvement. If they can't be controlled with oral meds I will have to go on insulin. Before starting pred my diabetes was well controlled with metformin. I'm now on 4 different diabetes medication!
I'm now thinking that it may not be PMR, I have had fibromyalgia for 12 years. The thing is the pred stopped the pain in my knees which have osteo arthritis and also in my back and hips. Is this normal and why has the pain come back? Advice please!

"Could i get someting off my chest.
Before my doctor told me i could have pmr, i was having problems walking without pain, bone cancer was ruled out, and then my doctor did blood tests and said they were higher than should be, so she said pred was the only medication that would help.
After reading the leaflet i went back to her, because my sister has bi-polar, and my mum developed mental [problems when my dad died suddenly.
My doctor said they would monitor me and told my hubby to watch for signs, 
My worry is if i had to increase my pred (due to GCA, which i do have symptoms - pain over forehead, temple pain, cheek pain, and a cough)
would they be able to treat me, and i know my hubby would not be able to cope.
Yes i know there are people worse off then me, and i thank god when i wake up on a morning and have another day to look forward too.
I have learned a lot from this forum, and all you lovely people are helpful, i am coping a lot better now and do not panic as much.
At the moment i am still reducing from 10mg to 9mg, and find some days are better than others(if i do too much i suffer, and i know thats my fault)so the next day i rest more.
Well i feel better for talking about this, and i have talked to my doctor who is very understanding about my worries, i feel as if i am in a catch 22 situation.

"Yea, I read on this great site a few days ago a comment by Eileen that lack of magnesium can cause muscle cramps.  Made me stand up and think.  I also read this week that Proton Pump Inhibitors like Nexium can cause low magnesium in addition to diuretics, and I take both.  For the past  couple of days I had also been suffering severe cramps in my upper left arm (heart attack? but no other symptoms) and in my right thumb.  And recently my  diet had been rather poor and I had been eating peanuts which have no magnesium rather than almonds which have loads of magnesium.  So I sat down and made myself split  pea soup, a pretty good source, and had 2 large bowls, and the cramps have not returned!  I am just about to go shopping for almonds!!  And maybe some magnesium tablets.  Since low magnesium can cause heart attacks, it is at least conceivable that the left arm pain was one.  So thank you all!  Yes, California farmers, keep watering those almond trees!
p.s. I accidentally posted this first in RA rather than here.

"I saw my Rheumi Consultant again this week. I had been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arhtritis but my symptoms and blood tests all pointed towards PMR. My GP agreed and I started on 20mg Pred the beginning of March gradually reducing to taking 13mg (actually down to 12mg as of today).
My Consultant is still adamant I have inflammatory arthritis and not PMR. Two reasons - PMR should be controlled at 10mg Pred maximum and my CK blood test was 34 so there was nothing wrong with my muscles.
She wants me to start on Methotrexate now and carry on reducing the Pred.
I'd appreciate any comments. To be honest I haven't any fight left in me, so I'll do as she says and see what happens, but if that pain comes back I'll go bananas.

"I wanted to update the group in case my experience might be of help to anyone else.  
I got hit by the PMR train in January 2015.  My worst pain was shoulders, then hips, and some pain in my knees.   I was officially diagnosed with PMR in May 2015 based on my symptoms, test results and exclusion of other diseases based on test results. 
My rheumy suspected PMR early on.   Because of severe side effects due to oral Pred given for allergies 30 years ago, I dug my heels in and refused to start on a high or moderate dose of oral Pred.  I agreed on March 4 to accept a 40mg  kenalog (cortisone) injection in both my left shoulder and right knee. 
Within a few days, my hip pain had subsided completely.  My left shoulder pain and knees were greatly improved. Rheumy said there was a systemic value to the localized injections.  Within a couple of weeks, it was clear the benefit of the injections was wearing off.  I agreed to begin taking 5mg oral Pred.  It helped but was insufficient to manage the PMR pain that was returning.  
So I agreed to up the Pred to 10 mg, and asked the rheumy for a localized kenalog injection in my right shoulder about six weeks ago, as my right shoulder had continued to give me the most pain.  
I am am happy to report that as of right now, I am still 99% pain free.   Rheumy had me go down to 9mg the first of June.  I had a couple of weird days (about the 3rd/4th days of the taper) where I had some discomfort and bad dizziness but it passed after a few days.  Rheumy had warned me that as I begin to taper, ""your body will talk to you and not in a good way.""  I took a couple days off work during the taper to let my body adjust, and that seemed to help.  
For or the record, I'm 59 (will turn 60 this year).  I have tried to stay as active as possible.  I'm not running any marathons but do try to get in 2-3miles a day.  Some days I do and some I don't.  But I feel it helps me stay balanced.  
To to all of you - my heart breaks as I understand the pain you are in.  I wish you all a pain-free and peaceful day.

He put me on 20mg of prednisone for 5 days and redone bloods.  crp came back at 8 (normal), so he told me that's a positive for PMR and started me on prednisone 20mg for 7 days then told me to drop to 15mg, blood test after 1wk 15mg came back at crp12 so he put me back up to 20mg for 1wk, another blood test , crp 8.6  back down to 18mg this time for 1wk crp 9. so now he said he thinks I have atypical PMR ??? and wants to wean me off prednisone and send me to a specialist which will take about 3-4mths to get an appt
he has said to take
18mg for 1 wk
15mg for 1wk
10mg for 1wk
7mg  for 1 wk   then have blood test.   today I am starting to get all my pain back and am sooo confused, can anybody shed any light

"I have been on prednisone since January for PMR.  I am currently down to 15 mg.  It seems my side effects from the prednisone come and go.  Is that what others experience?  My swollen face is better on some days and blown up like a balloon on others.  Same thing with fatigue, water retention, and all other side effects I experience.  I just figured when the side effects started to diminish they would continue to diminish but have found that isn't so.  Anyone else have this problem?  Thanks.....

"My shoulders have been agonising so I decided to try what I call reverse posture.  This means the opposite of everything I was ever taught:  rather than tuck my butt in, I stick it out; rather than pull my tummy in, I arch my back and stick my tummy out.  Then I can let my shoulders relax backwards without effort and let my arms hang down.  I look up. The pain is much reduced and sometimes disappears.  I can even sit this way, although I feel like a dwarf with short arms! 
    I have a far out theory why this may help:  I was taught north European posture; my mother used to nag me about it and even my dressage teacher taught me this posture.  Perhaps this is why PMR is prevalent among northeuropeans and not other ethic groups.

"Hi, I was diagnosed with this condition a few years ago in my left hip. I was given a steroid injection in my thigh and to be truthful, I completely forgot about the pain. I still get niggly pain, but nothing I can't cope with. In January this year, I was diagnosed with it in my right hip and was given a steroid injection in March. It worked for a couple of days, but after that, the pain is worse than before. I am due a follow up in September. Painkillers don't seem to help at all.  Any other sufferer's out there? Thank you.

"Hi all. After suffering from acid probs since being on pred, I have now undergone a gastroscopy. The doctor took acid reflux in her stride but when I complained that all my food tastes of plastic and my voice has gone funny (I can't raise my voice to make myself heard and after saying two or three sentences I have to 'catch' my breath) that she sent me for an urgent referrel. I expected them to stick one of those balloon things in my oesophagus and that would be that. Oh no! Apparently, I now have a stomach ulcer, gastritis, oesophagitis and suspected Barretts disease! They have changed my stomach meds and I have to go for another scope in a few weeks. Now, my question is this: With these new ones, I now have ten 'conditions' (I won't bore you with the list)! Do I 'win' the gold medal?!!! Has anyone else got this or should I not be blaming 'poor' old pred for everything? Feeling somewhat overwhelmed by all this. Hope you are all having a 'good' day.

"Have had PMR for almost 18 mos. Gone from 10 mg down to 7 mg using the Bristol regimen. A few weeks ago I had a bad taper down to 6 mg...lasted 2-1/2 weeks..went back up to 7 mg on the advice of this forum (Thank you!). This past week has been stressful and I am more than fatigued. Sore in all the PMR spots, weight of my body too heavy to sleep at night, night sweats. Could I have flu, complicated by PMR?  Or could I possibly relapse back to the beginning?

"Hi, 
Can anyone please point me in the direction of the thread for reducing prednisolone. I found it once by chance but am blowed if I can find it again.
I was diagnosed with both PMR and fibromyalgia last year and was put on 10mg prednisolone which was increased to 15mg. I reduced down to 9mg and was then increased to 15mg. 2 weeks ago I was increased to 20mg (for 2 weeks to get the inflammation under control). This tied in nicely with rheumy appointment yesterday who said I can now reduce again.
The rheumy has pretty much left it to me and said if I get a flare up or become unstable then increase back to the dose I felt okay on.
My GP on the other hand makes me have blood tests every month and increases or decreases the prednisolone going off my blood test results though I only reduce by 1mg every month.
I now feel the fat face and weight gain are dragging me down so would really appreciate someone pointing me in the direction of that sensiblr reduction thread.
Many thanks

"My journey of PMR has been a scary one !
The advice and tips that I have received from this forum have helped so much on my bite sized road to feeling 'me again' ....well that might be slightly exaggerated .... But I am certainly feeling better in myself     
I have like others ,thought I new better and have tried to reduce my pred on 4 occasions with disastrous effects !!! 
I started on pred at the beginning of April 20 mgs and following medical advice did try to reduce by 5 mgs ...... Following Eileen's advice and that of others this was far too much . On my other attempts dropping 1mg at a time I can go no lower than 17.5 without the awful sweats returning within 12 hours , thumb,toe and hips flaring up again .
I have also been unfortunate and have fractured my foot .... 5 weeks ago ...went over on my ankle... The ligament popping caused the fracture !!! 
10 days ago I fractured a vertebra in my spine trying to pull my washing machine ....loud crack ..back to dependency upon others !
Despite these setbacks my awful symptoms of PMR boney pains and awful muscle pains and weakness appeared to improve greatly by about 80 % and do not feel ill within myself.

"Hope all my fellow sufferers out there are feeling in good spirits . I have not been in touch because I find my pains here and there are boring me let alone everyone else . However as usual I find comfort in moaning to you all because you understand . Since my weekend in A and E with chronic head pain ,and the first doctor I saw did not know of PMR or prednisalone which I explained were steroids ,I can see where some of you are coming from when you say PMR is little understood .
After my awful weekend ,and finding that even morphine couldn't ease the pain , when I was discharged I was told that it was thought that I had multimigrains caused by a mixture of PMR and ostioatheritis in my neck mixed with the trigeminal nerve pain which I have had for years .
Now I am wondering what is going on .My crp ? Level was only 22 this was May Day weekend . 5weeks before it was about 35 and I felt ok .Now my last blood test which I had last week was 40 . My neck shoulder pain is nigally and when I turn some Times I get shooting pain through my neck to top of my head , Can PMR cause this . The doctor at the hospital sujjested I get a second opinion from a neurologist which my doctor has arranged . Have an appointment in two months .Even though my crp level is raised my doctor has told me to stay at the pred level I am at which is 9.5 until my next blood test in 5 weeks .i feel I should perhaps go back up to 10mg .They did do a CT scan when I was in hospital I assume for GCA and I was found to be ok . But feel as though my life is in the lap of the gods , and I hope one of them doesn't sneeze . Sorry this note!! is long winded , but sympathy and tea would be nice , please

"Since Feb this year Ive been on prednisolone for PMR, reducing from original 15mg to 12.5.  I felt awful, went to our GP and he put daily dose right up to 20mg daily.  I was a bit worried at such an increase but he said to try it for a week, see if I felt better and come back to him .
Couldnt get an appointment with him, so 10 days later I saw the doctor again saying I felt no better, well - maybe very slightly better but shaking so I couldnt carry a cup of tea and very dizzy.  GP said I hadnt been long on the higher dose so I chould cut the preds down pretty fast, like 2mg evey week.,  Ive been doing that for  ten days and feel worse than ever.  I can cross the room but with 2 sticks, and I lean on the table / sink/ whatever to do anything one-handed.  
  My GP isnt at all confidence inspiring, I went back to see him but he's reading ""what to do"" off the same internet sites I read the night before.  I could finish his sentences for him.  (Cant blame him; they cant be experts on every bloomin' ailment)  
I wont get to see the hospital rheumo specialist for another month, and frankly dont think I wil be walking  a month from now! 
I'm a bit desparate. Should I up the preds dose even tho' my GP still advises rcutting back?
Should I shake out the piggy bank and try to see a private Rheumo?

"I was diagnosed with PMR in October 2013. Responded dramatically and well to Prednisone beginning at 10 mg. and slowly tapering over 18 mos. to 2 mg. My life was normal, including aerobics, walking, lifting weights etc. The s/e of pred were minimal and I was looking forward to being done with the meds although in no big rush. Returning from vacation to FL last month, where I had been very active and pain free, I had a couple of close connections in airports and ""speedwalked"" in sandals for long strenuous distances. The next morning I was in pain again, nearly as bad as the intital bout. [I have no pain in my upper body this time for which I am incredibly grateful but the pelvic girdle region is very bad and I am unable to walk more than 100 yds (on a good day)] I actually think I may have a bursitis type thing in my right hip + PMR, both triggered by this ""injury."" The pain in trochanter is being treated with ultrasound and rest by  my PT and is improving but the rest seems pretty variable from day to day.I felt like I was improving yesterday for example and then today woke up in misery. Rheumatologist put me on 2.5, then 5.0 and now 7.5 for a week each and only now am I showing any signs of improvement--and these are not breathtaking. I am also taking 7.5-15mg of Meloxicam, which I never needed with Pred the first go around. Naturally, I am devastated by this development; I didn't know you could relapse from PMR which I know see is not uncommon.  I am freaking out that I am not responding to the Pred like before and I am also worried about the higher dose and the time on the drug etc etc. My question is should I be considering an even higher dose or if I stay patient at 7.5 will it work just more slowly than before? Is the slower response to Pred predictable because I""ve been on it so long? Rheumatologist. seems quite casual with prescribing of Pred but doesn't offer much else. I feel like he is sort of letting me dictate the tx course and what I need here is some guidance/reasurance and help with discerning best practice. Access to doc is limited; I am really just communicating wtih a nurse weekly. These forum has been the most helpful resource I have found, frankly. I am trying to stick with the practical reality of my situation but the emotion and ""the stories I'm telling myself"" as well as the inability to move are really creating a secondary depression. Thank you for any thoughts that might be germane.

"I don 't kndonow about anyone else but I am beginning to find far too many
contradictory medical/drug treatments being quoted here for PNR. Probably because of the now international quality of the forum. In UK we do not have the choices offered in US or even Australia and most doctors here are not clued up with PMR at all... let alone the different medications talked about.
I hate this debilitating condition it has messed my life up for so long now. However I am beginning to hate even more the crnkiness of people who think they may be suffering from it when they have a touch of 'rheumaticsor even a bad hangover',so that it turns into the controversial equivalent of what Chronic Fatigue Syndrom was a few decades back before it was recognised I have a diagnostic letter from a specialist dated 2008 when I was suffering all the symptoms and more. I was eventually diagnosed with Graves disease and a 75% blockage in my left heart area.After a stent and some Thyroid medication I sort of recovered but in the diagnosis the words 'possible Polymialgi rhematica / GCA were listed...no one ever followed this up. Only two years ago after a fall from a great height did this thing really manifest itself in full bloom. I meet many who say they also have the condition...and many more who know someone with it... however I have never met anyone having to deal with the symptoms I have  nor anyone else on Prednisolone so it appears that it has become the 'tired people's disease of choice' just like Chronic fatugue Syndrom.
My neighbour who is 85 has PMR but does not take Pred he works 12 hour days as a farmer.... My daughters mother in law claims she has it but does not take Pred...but she also gads about like a 20 year old so a bit of a puzzle... when I can't even brush my hair without pain...

"I have been working on PMR reduction with prednisone and methotrexate for about 16 months and after a ‘flare’ about a year ago, I have been on a slow ‘taper’ from 20 mg pred using a 5-10% reduction of the medication monthly over that period.
Now I am just tapering from 4.5 mg to 4 mg.
Generally all the thigh, shoulder, hip and shoulder girdles pain and ache levels seem to be maintaining a fairly uniform and bearable background level that has allowed me to keep the taper going at this rate (currently 3-5% medication dose).
But – one big issue that is really bothering me, and hasn’t followed the overall body pain reduction, are my HANDS.
The pain in the hands is not like carpel tunnel – it is in all joints of both hands from the wrist to the furthest finger joint.
Both hands are almost locked up in the morning and need constant flexing (which is painful) to allow me to open the marmalade jar ! The flexibility and pain level does improve slightly toward the evening but is never gone completely.
I have checked the Forum for similar conditions and haven’t found anything specific – I was wondering if others have this specific condition or is it likely that I may have some other Rheumatic condition that is ‘tagging’ along with the PMR ??
Thanks ahead,
David

"My Rheumatoid Arthritis has been well managed since diagnosis a few years ago with slow onset, mainly in my hands and fingers. I am on methotrexate 2.5 mg. once a week and hydroxychlor (Plaquenil) 200 mg. X 2 daily.  Recent SED rate was low (25, down from 28), but 10 -11 weeks ago I begain complaining of symptoms that suggested to me that my RA was advancing, including typical PMA shoulder, hip pains, fatigue, and what I presumed was mostly job stress related depression.  The rhuematology clinician that I saw then gave me a 6-day prescription for predinasone which significantly improved these symptoms.  However, as I also have IBS, and had gone off regular laxatives (Linzess), I contracted a painful constipation episode.  About 3 or 4 weeks ago, the symptoms of neck, hip, shoulder, sleepless painful nights, etc. returned and caused me to complain during my regular appointment with rheumatology Dr.  I was diagnosed with PMA and started taking low grade predinazone (Rayos 2 mg. x 1) last night, which, with regular stool softeners, I hope will help.  However, I also started having shooting intermittent pain behind my right eye about 2 weeks ago and thought it was a sinus condition at the back door, since I am outdoors in my garden much of my free time and thought pollens and molds in the dirt were triggers.  Since having my eyes checked back in February, the opthalmologist suggested that the constant blurry spot in the inside corner of my right eye that seemed to be a recurrent floater needs to be monitored in my next appointment, as the previous year's tests that they give to look for visual abnormalities ( monitoring for RA drug interaction) suggested I might have a slight blind spot in that area.  The temporal headache I am having is sporadic and shooting pain with some minor headaches accompanying it.  I mentioned this yesterday and she suggested that I could also have the beginnings of GCA with the PMA.  Having just lost two friends to brain tumors, I am fearful and want to stay on top of this.  I will take the samples of Rayos that she provided me with for another week or so, and if the temporal pain subsides, then we know the medicine is taking care of it.  I hope not to have to increase the level of predinasolone, but whatever works will work.  
What I am curious to know is...what is the connection to my RA diagnosis or is it just a concurrent accident?  Interestingly, due to my profession as a historian and being keenly interested in my ancestry, my family DNA haplogroup gives us a good inkling that our English ancestry goes back to prehistoric origins in Southern Norway.  I just read about the studies linking Scandinavian heredity to increased incidence of PMA.

"Hi to all
I've been so ill for so long. Years later sevete fatigue and pain have won over my life. My gp stayed me on low dose of 15mg to be reduced to 7.5mgs. So far they have helped with my pains and um sleeping less. But my muscle weakness is still very bad.
At least I can get out of bed and get dressed now. I can comb my hair and if im careful I can do a MINI grocery shop ie loaf of bread and chunk of cheese. Anything else would be to heavy.
I'm so grateful for the help but would like to ask her if she could up it a tad more. Reason being is I'm alone and nothing gets done if I don't do it. Hence I'm in a mess. Soooooo IF she could up it for a little while so I could have longer physical strength for a few months to Carbost all my lovely things to fix up my home then I could pay for a cleaner to help me with everyday chores. I just don't want to sound rude to her as I know she's looking out for the terrible side effects this could have on Mr.

"Welll the lab results came in the mail today.  .C.-Reactive Protein was 0.3
and the ESR was 7 
I'm taking 6mg of Pred. but still don't feel great.... especially with the fatigue, which can be very inconsistent.  Some mornings start out good and then by the afternoon I'm so beat it's crazy or the other way around.  Out of bed my legs and arms feel like they will fall off and are difficult to move and this can last all day. Occ. I still can experience some shoulder ""achyness"" and neck aches.  Also the tooth ache also comes and goes !!  I don't understand the inconsistent days of bad and not quite so bad.
  The only comment from the physician was ""neither of which showed significant inflammation""  Not exactly sure what that means...I guess it's not like you are either pregnant or not !!!
  Hope everyone is having a tolerable weekend.
All the best,  judy

"I don't have GCA & hope I never do, but I've read of many instances here on the forum of people who have PMR that suddenly develop GCA. I know that my rheumatologist told me when he first saw me for PMR, that if I suddenly lost the vision in an eye or got a severe temporal headache to get to the emergency room immediately. As I was getting packed today to go to our lake cabin that is no where near a hospital, I wondered what I would do if I suddenly lost my vision in an eye and knew it would be hours before I could get to a hospital emergency room. Is there a protocol for this? Would I just gulp down 50-60mg of prednisone?? Points to ponder.

"After a couple of crappy weeks following at 2.5mg drop from 15mg to 12.5mg I decided to go back up to 15mg two weeks ago.
At the same time, but unrelated, I got quite ill - not gastro, but the same result if you get my meaning. I did post on here seeking advice.
Because of the high likelihood of developing a second autoimmune disease, and the well known link between gluten and PMR, I decided to cut out all gluten - and dairy - which follows eliminating all sugar (other than fruit) and seed oils (omega 6 polyunsaturated oils) back in January (you might well ask what there is left to eat!).
So now I feel GREAT! All the bloating, moon face, fat neck, pain, fatigue - you name is - has compeltely gone!! It's a bloody miracle!!
My dilemma now is - which one has made me feel so better????? :-)
Firstly I'm reducing much slower - 1mg at a time and I'll see how that goes.
Secondly, in a month or so I'll reintroduce some dairy back into my diet and see how that goes too.
A question however, how many of you have tried gluten or dairy free and felt heaps better?

"My internist checks my CRP (and other bloodwork) for the annual physical.
I had some tendonitis in my mousing arm before I had PMR symptoms in May 2013. CRP 2.4.
During the worst of PMR prior to diagnosis, the CRP was 15.4. The rheumy at the time misdiagnosed it as being Fibromyalgia and put me on 700 mg Gabapentin. I also was going to acupuncture regularly. About a month later the CRP was down to 3.2. I was still having pain and realized that my symptoms really did not match those of Fibromyalgia and I found a new Rheumy December 2013. She told me it was PMR (symptoms were stiff hips/groin, inability to get out of bed, sleep, climb stairs, able to lift arms, inability to turn neck, etc.) and put me on 20 mg of Prednisone and the result was amazing: pain gone in a few days, flexibility back except for a frozen shoulder, which eventually resolved with PT and yoga.
Continued with acupuncture and lowered 300 mg Gabapentin at night and tapered Prednisone to 11/10 mg May 2014. CRP measured 0.8 and still pain free.
May 2015, on 5.5 mg Prednisone, 300 mg Gabapentin, less frequent acupuncture: CRP 2.9 and still pain free.
SED rate normal since I started Prednisone.
Question: Since I have no PMR symptoms, why is the CRP elevated? My other bloodwork is normal (except for a slight elevation of LDL, probably from increasing my cheese consumption for Calcium).
Thank you!

"Yesterday I started with a pain in my buttock and was convinced it was sciatica.  I have had it now and then over the years and it has always gone with diclofenac after a couple of days.  I did not have a good night with it last night and as today has worn on it is excruciatingly painful. I have only been taking paracetamol for it.  Even when I pull my my jeans it is AGONY!!!!!  As though raising my arms is sticking a knife in my right buttock.  QUESTION!  Does PMR make sciatica much much worse OR could this be a flare up although it is much worse than the pain I had in my buttock pre diagnosis?

"hi
i need help understanding what my body will feel as I continue reduction in predinsone.  I'm presently at 5.5 mg but physically able to do so much more than just two weeks ago. I can garden for two hours and walk for 45 minutes and the fatigue seems to be lifting.
I was diagnosed two years ago in May, had one flair. My CRP has returned to normal. But I'm two years older so I can't tell age from PRM.
In the recent past, I've been slowly reducing by about one mg/2 mos. Because my body is functioning better does this mean I'm going into remission? What do I need to be aware of, as symptoms as I still want to take care og myself? How long until complete remission?  I understand relapse is possible so I want to take it slowly, but how slowly. The prednisone has done it's damage.
This is so uplifting but I'm also aware.
Thanks barb

"I thought I should tell you a little of my journey with PMR because I was not treated with the “traditional” amounts of prednisone. 
When I started on prednisone my arms and shoulders were agony to any touch and very weak.  I had been suffering with undiagnosed leg issues for 10 years.  Problems walking any great distance, doing stairs, getting in and out of vehicles.  Upper body was too painful to sleep in a bed.  I slept in a lounge chair. 
 I’m one of those individual with raised inflammation markers.  My ESR/CRP levels and Prednisone at the start of treatment were:
20 mg    March 11/14                      41/169.9
25 mg    March 14/14                      78/43.1
40 mg    March 18/14                      15/0.4                 
I had some relief at 20 mg, perhaps 30%.  The increase to 25 mg a few days later helped a bit more, but I had a complete melt down with pain on March 18 with increased weakness and pain encompassing my neck and upper back.  I couldn’t lift a single dinner plate into the cupboard.  I couldn’t get in and out of my sleeping chair without help.  Toileting and dressing were agony.  I was ready for a walker, raised toilet seat, and homecare.  Twelve hours after increasing to 40 mg and I was pain free!  Felt better than I had in 10 years! A new woman.  And it happened on my 65th birthday! 
Unfortunately, I was tapered down too far too fast and had a relapse 2 months later.  I had to return to 40 mg, but never returned to the euphoric pain free me.  My lead legs came back and I’m living with them again.  But that’s another story.  I have now tapered to 14 mg and am hopeful that I will be able to continue with gradual drops.  Over the last year of tapering my ESR has ranged between 9 and 12; and CRP 1.3 to 4.6.  Although my ESR reading last week was 6, it’s still in the normal range.
The fact that it took 40 mg to get things under control has worried me on many occasions.  Particularly when Eileen suggests that if things aren’t controlled at 15 or 20 mg, it may not be PMR.  I respect Eileen’s opinions and value her input and recommendations more than any medical practitioner I have dealt with re: PMR.   However, I read all of the forums regularly and based on comments by Eileen and other sage advisors, I believe that several things MAY have dictated my need for higher levels of prednisone.  First, the issues I’ve had with my legs for 10 years was determined to be undiagnosed PMR. So, PMR already had a good hold on me.  Second, the significant and painful involvement of my neck and shoulders may indicate that GCA, without temporal involvement, may have been lurking, and lastly, I was about 40 pounds overweight on diagnosis.  All of these things may have resulted in a need for a 40 mg start.  My symptoms were, and are, so typically PMR. 
Just thought I’d share my experience.  We are all so different.  Of course I have all the wonderful side effects…moon face, thick neck, widow’s hump, sensitive teeth, weight gain, fatigue, fuzzy brain………..

"I'm confused!  I've noticed a few times here people have mentioned that their doctors have said their CRP was normal and the inflammation was under control, so why do they still have pain?  A few months back my CRP was in the low normal range and I still had discomfort as well.  I can see where a very high CRP would 'ring alarm bells', but my impression is that I am the best judge of what dose of Prednisone to be on and will make my best recovery using the 'dead slow approach' suggested here.  I also want to ask about those days I experience tremendous fatigue after a busy day.  Is this a manifestion of PMR, Prednisone, thyroid, or adrenal issues, or some combination of them?  Reading the posts here I notice fatigue is particularly prevalent if one is overly active. It appears as though PMR and Prednisone are major contributors here along wiith the inflammatory process likely being irritated somewhat.  I'd appreciate your comments here.

"Hi Everyone, It's like winning the lottery (not that I have) but I was able to do a 20 min walk today.  The first in a very long time.  I have tried twice before and only got a short distance because of calf muscles pulling/aching and my son was with me just in case I needed his arm.  He came with me today and I was so over the moon, just a slight pull on the left calf and I sat on someones window sill for a tiny rest but then continued.  No one knows what this means to me (or maybe you do).  Having a choice is good but when you have no choice it's terrble.

"Hi all, I just have a question about the weight gain of prednisone.  Since taking it for a year and a half and having to go up on it a couple of times, I've gained 25 pounds and now weigh 250 (I'm kinda tall).  For the first time yesterday I bought a 3X pair of jeans!  So, now I'm going to try to cut down on the calories and snacks.  My question is, with the weight from pred. does that mean I won't be able to lose weight easily, since I'm still taking a big dose 18mg a day, trying to gradually cut down but having so much pain.  What I mean is: does the weight of pred. stay on you, as long as you take it?  Or can you lose it before?   Sounds like a dumb question now...haha

"Hi fellow sufferers!
I am so glad that I have found this forum, because reading through some of the discussions, I feel a little reassured that I am not alone in experiencing the affects of both the PMR and tapering of Predisolone.  
The biggest problem I seem to have, is the attitude of my GP, who I think like many others, don't really understand PMR, or tapering of Prednisolone.  I was diagnosed with PRM last May, after suffering with it for months before.  I started on 20mg of Pred' reduced quickly to 17.5 and 15mg and then by 1mg every 4 weeks, religiously since then.  I am now down to 5mg, but have been struggling with some really bad days, especially more recently.  Over time I have worked out for myself that there is a relationship between this tapering and how I feel but all my GP is concerned about is that the inflamation is being kept low and getting me off the Pred' as fast as possible. He also insists that I should not be experiencing any PMR symptoms at all while the inflamation is being kept in check!
I recently had a check up at Rheumy' and the consultant said I should now reduce the Prednisolone more slowly, especially in view of me experiencing such dreadful fatigue, headaches, hot flushes, and those particular PMR pains etc, but my GP still argued with that.  I am of course taking the advise of my consultant.
At least I now know that I am not alone in experiencing all the various nasties and I can tell my family that I really am not going mad!......oh...and I think....tell my GP where to go!

"I am going to sit down today and record the tapering schedule, along with reminders and warnings about reducing. Seems to be a fine line between prednisone withdrawal and the PMR...and, in my case, the ""emotional"" decision that strives toward reducing the prednisone (despite everyone's warning!). January 1st I had been on 10 mg for about a year and that day reduced to 9 mg using Lodger's (similar to Eileen's) regimen. After 45 days I tapered from 9 to 8 mg. After 29 days I taoered from 8 to 7 mg, but spent the first week wondering if it was the right choice...but it stabilized! After 43 days I went from 7 to 6 mg. for 19 days...struggled most days.
Read the advice from the forum...thank you! Went back to 7 mg two days ago.....dont know yet if it will be enough to ""catch"" the flare.
Question: Shiuld I stay on the 7 mg for 4-6 weeks if I feel ok....then reduce by .5....using Lodger's regimen?...or do something else?
Guess I got a little ""cocky"" from January to April....should have highlighted the forum's warning about the new obstacles as the. dosage gets lower! Thank you for all your support!
P.S. Only explanation I have for the variant in the amount of days on the taper is that I was going on how good I felt....?

"Two nights ago I can't find medicine for my gut and I know it's in the house. I turn the house upside down and can't find it. Finally I figure out it's in the car, so I head out in the evening to check the car (in my slippers and bathrobe) only to find out it's raining. Naturally I parked the car outside instead of in the garage. I get in the car and start searching. I lean over the armrest to dig in the back seat and I hear this loud ""pop"". I don't move and think (insert favorite expletive) ""omg, I've cracked a rib!""  I trudge back thru the rain (without medicine) into the house, where I have to share the news with husband who is busily packing for a business trip, the one I swore he could go on because ""everything was good"". So now I tell him, yes, I may have cracked a rib, but still, everything is good. I show him on the internet (multiple sites) that the treatment for a cracked rib is just otc pills or prescription pain pills (which I already have) and there's no need for the hospital because I can breathe just fine, he doesn't leave til morning so if there are changes, blah, blah, blah, I'll call my doc the next day, etc. 
So, no changes, just same pain, so I send him off. I call my doctor's office the next day, late morning and leave a message, They get back to me and say, hold tight, we'll talk to the doc. Eventually they call and the doc says get to the clinic NOW and have this bloodwork and set of xrays done. I'm like ""sure, as soon as my daughter and I finish lunch"" because she happens to have the day off. She sighs because this is yet another day ruined due to mom's illness. I swear to her it will be quick and it was. we head back home and resume our day (she's painting) when we get a call from my doc freaking out because my d-dimer is off the charts (crp isn't back yet). Get to hospital now, suspected clot. I'm like, what about the cracked rib? Forget the rib!
Well as those of you with children know, there is no NOW. 2 hours later I'm in the hospital emergency room, after packing my daughter for an overnight, making her lunch for the next day because she has dietary issues, and finding a place to dump her for the night. I get to the hospital, park in the wrong place, go into the wrong doors, can't find the emergency part, end up having to go back out, find my car, drive to the emergency front doors and park (I'm blaming gabapentin for this stupidity, though topamax may have had a share of it). They take me right away even though it's busy and I spend the next hour filling out forms and trying to explain why my doc thought it was so important that I come to the emergency room. Eventually, after I've paid (yes, this is America) , they decide to run the same tests plus some more, a CT scan, etc. The only obstacle is that i have no veins. 4 different attempts to find a place to put in an IV fail (IV for CT scan has to be above wrist). They stick one in the hand to get blood for the bloodwork and then give up, telling the doc she'll have to run a different type of CT scan (apparently more expensive and longer). I tell them to keep trying, I'm game, so they send in Troy, who finally finds a vein in my forearm that works. Oh the bruises! meanwhile I finally get my IV and CT scan. More delay (thank goodness I brought a book and embroidery). 
Of course, husband knows nothing of this. I figure, why worry him when there isn't anything to tell him? I'll wait til there's news. I was going to tell him when he called between plane flights but that's when he shared with me that a friend called. One of this best friends from college has been given a diagnosis of malignant brain cancer and has been given a few months to live. Nope, I figure my news can wait.
Eventually the doctors come back in and share with me the news. Apparently I'm suffering from a ""chronic PE,"" one that's been there for who knows how long, but it didn't develop overnight. Prescription is LMWH in mega dose 2x a day, see my GP and hematologist (and I have one because i have Factor V leiden!). They didn't feel I needed to be hospitalized, thank goodness, because I was breathing just fine, ECG was good, etc and everyone wants to save money. Eventually they let me go, and I'm due to see my GP the minute she gets into the office this a.m. Best part, ER thinks I did crack a rib but it's not showing up on the xray (after all that calcium/vit d/magnesium I've been taking too). 
Hilarious note: the entire time I'm in the ER, the nurses blamed Prednisone for everything. No vein? Pred. Fractured rib? Pred. Possible PE? Pred. and Factor V leiden. Now these are all legit, but it was just so comforting to hear someone else say it :D.

Once again last night i had pain over my eyebrows and my eyes were stinging, earache, and pain in the neck (so i am , i have been told) it is scary when it is a night time, and i know a lot of you do suffer with this, i think because i am reducing it worries me more, should the pred be helping to ease this on 10mg at the moment, or am i just worrying for nothing.
I really think it is one of thoses weeks were i am having niggles  as last week it did not seem so bad. Just wanted to talk about it with someone who understands. Sorry

"When I was in my 20s I went to a fabulous Indian resturant with my then boyfriend (couldn't remember who it was to save myself) and my brother and his current girlfriend (ditto). We ordered a banquet for four. It was the BEST thing I'd ever eaten. It was so good that we decided we'd get ANOTHER banquet! And the we ate it. All of it.
Not surprisingly, the staff were amazed.
Also not surprisingly, as I lay in my bed that night, my stomach hurt so much I thought I would die.
I was so full the skin on my stomach was stretched to it's limit (clearly this was before I'd had a baby!).
What has this got to do with PMR? My stomach feels the same way - it's been getting worse for the past two weeks and I can barely stand having my pants on.
I'm not the thinnest person in the world but neither am I extremely obese (ok, well, just a little bit obese lol) but now my stomach is distended to the point I am waddling like I'm pregnant.
I know that bloating is a side effect of pred, but this is rediculous! Could it be 'just' the pred, or should I consider that my immune system has gone completely insane and I'm now intolerant of gluten/lactose/fresh air??
This is driving me NUTS.

"Is there a correlation between PMR and those who have had prior histories of immune (auto or otherwise) disorders ( including but not limited to asthma, skin rashes or symptoms, systemic, arthiritis) I wonder about  patterns.
As I have mentioned, I think many times the beginnings of PMR are stimulated by stress and trauma. I wonder if there are commen auto immune markers or conditions which are precursors to PMR.
I have had chronic eczema (Dyshidrosis), hands, backs of knees and elbows, since a child, and vitIligo since the teens, a skin condition which causes spontaneous skin pigment loss, sometimes partial repigmentation occors. Less noticable on light skin.
Gosh, we tell all here, don't we?

"       Here I have this common, painful, debilitating, treatable disease and I can't find rheumies in Michigan interested in it.  I looked up  the rheumatology faculty research and interests at the Univ. of Mich. and all I found was lupus, RA and scleroderma. I did find some rheumies that were more promising at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, although GCA was more interesting to them than PMR.  Still, that was a closer interest.   I wish I could fly to Scotland or Bristol!!..but my medical insurance wouldn't pay for the consult even if I paid for the flight.  Probably couldn't get the prescription filled here anyway.  So I am thinking I should call the Mayo Clinic.  Any other ideas?

I'm a 60 year old woman who up until now was exercising 6 days a week. This exercise included using free weights and aoerbics. I saw my GP and she started me on levothyroxine for borderline hypothyroidism . I was on it for a month before I quit cold Turkey. I immediately lost 5 pounds and also was diagnosed with a full width rotator cuff tear! After the tear My other shoulder started to hurt and for some time now I've had tight hip flexor pain,front of thighs/ and pain behind my knees,this is all been exacerbated since the rotator cuff tear, I was having trouble getting up from a sitting position, and rolling over in bed was killing me! I saw a Rheumatologist , he is testing me for all arthritic conditions and autoimmune disorders.

Recently the brain fog does not seem as bad, however, the pain is a little worse in the night sometimes (cold, wet weather?) and worse in the a.m. I have been taking a couple of tylenol a few times a week to help with the stiffness, rather than up the dose of prednisone...ride it out. I remember the caution about tapering too soon, the relapses. Mentally I am better at 6...but not sure about the pain...it is manageable. Thank you for any comments or suggestions.

"Just an FYI, as it might help some of my fellow PMR travelers.
Am scheduled for cataract surgery on June 2 (left eye) and June 16 (right eye). 
Had an appointment with Rheumy today. She suggested I double my dose of Prednisone on the day of and the day after surgery (in my case I will be on 5 mg, so doubled = 10 mg) then on the third day to drop back to the 5 mgs.
She is happy with my sloooow rate of reduction, which is about 1 mg every 6 weeks or so at this mg level. She said that although I had passed the critical 7 mg level vis a vis my body kicking in, she felt caution was the way to go.
Concerning the base of my thumb arthritis/pain/groan/ouch issue in my Rt (dominant) hand: she did an ultrasound and while seeing the ultrasound, shot my joint up with steroid and gave me a hard brace to wear for a week.
Told me to return in 2 months. My SED rate is 2 (normal). I have those done monthly.
Still on Gabapentin (300 mg at night). Rheumy says it stabilizes the mood, among other benefits. I must say, I sleep through the night 7-8 hrs.
She insisted on exercise and in my case it is rowing, which I do for 3 kms 3 x per week on a Concept II Rower. This is a non impact exercise that I have been doing for a number of years. (We own a rowboat, so to keep in form, I need to continue.) I have no problems with this. I also do yoga stretches every day. And I walk and garden and walk around the office.
Counting down since December 2013......

"I see my dr. tomorrow and I'm concerned he will want to add MTX to my Prednisone because in the last 2 month ago my CRP was its lowest ever at 1.3 and now has gone to 7.3 and 7.6 on a test two days ago.  I have been on 9 mg of Pred for over a month but I admittedly dropped from 12 to 9mg over another 2 months.  My CRP readings coincide with increased morning stiffness and the duration it lasts.  From what I've read here with the 'dead slow' approach it appears I've dropped too fast and 9 mg is too low for me.  I expect tomorrow my family dr. will push for me to introduce Methotrexate but I want to ask for another chance to introduce the 'dead slow' approach.  I'm concerned he'll say we've tried this 3 or 4 times already and the Pred is not working. I'm hoping the approach Eileen and Mrs. O have outlined will work for me and will try to get my dr. to go along with this, after all he's the one I need to keep writing the prescriptions!  I would start by going to 10 mg for a few days and see how I feel and if there's no improvement go to 11 and slowly increase until I'm comfortable then get another CRP.  Even when my CRP was at 1.3 a few months ago I wasn't totally pain free but certainly doing better than I am now.  Might any of you have advice for me as I go into tomorrow's meeting?

"I wish I could send a photo of my massager. I paid £100 for it at the health and vitality show and it has helped me immeasurably and was suggested by a doctor. PMR, like GCA (which I also have) is caused by, recent theory suggests, poor blood circulation to the muscles and joints and I am sure my massager increases my blood circulation (so the information leaflet states). I can feel it doing me good by energising me. The anti-inflammation gels and creams can be rubbed in to a selected area, such as the individual shoulders, etc. I have spoken to a doctor who visits people in care homes who told me that this is how they treat their patients with aching, weak or painful muscles and joint pain caused by any kind of diagnosis, therefore avoiding prednisolone, Vit D3 + Cal, regular blood tests, reduction schedules, DEXA scans, etc. Why are these non systemic remedies for PMR not more well known I wonder?

Doc put me on 15 mg and morning One I felt so much better. Reduced to 12.5 a month later and by month 3 I asked to go up to 14 mg.  Since then zi reduced by half mg every 10 days. At 12.5 i felt as awful as pre-preds and have been told to take 20mg for last 4 days.  Felt no better, so GP tells me to reduce to 15 mg right away and "" in a few days"" down again to 12.5.
 It all seems chaotic and I am not sure my GP has seen much PMR.  Anyway I still have no pain, just weak and useless, shaky and poor balance.

"Dear All
A question arose on another website re Heberden's Nodes
”[color=indigo:72a9d329c3]I just found out today from the doctor that I have Heberden's Nodes. The top joint in the fingers have a lumpy look and I thought it was the beginning of RA. He said no, it comes with age, and his wife has them also. Told me to go online and look them up. It says that these are from osteoporosis, which I know I have from the prednisone. I am taking Vit. D and calcium now. I never had these till this PMR hit, and I attribute it to the pred”
[/color:72a9d329c3]
I have had Heberden’s Nodes for years - just did not have a ‘handle for them’.
In the Sunday Express Magazine this week an article by Tony Mayo who has osteoarthritis was published. I tried to find a link but no luck.
However this is the gist of it.
[color=darkred:72a9d329c3]“ Litozin, in research done by Dr Kaj Winther of Frederiksberg Copenhagen 80% of arthritis sufferers reported significant pain reduction after three weeks of Litozin. Studies have also been done in Norway.
The Sunday Express Magazine in the UK, A Doctor Rosemary Leonard says \""there is good evidence that Litozin can help reduce pain and stiffness in patients with osteoarthritis, and there is also evidence that it might help with RA.I do recommend it to patients but it is expensive\"".
[/color:72a9d329c3]
Litozin is made from rosehips and is a natural product, it was developed for horses.
.
However I do now have osteoarthritis in the knee.
I have found glucosomine (developed for horses - (1500mg per day) works for me. As my Rheumy says, does not work for everybody - so I count myself lucky and the difference is quite noticeable.
Has anybody tried Litozin? And what do Vets know that we don't.

"Hello,
I wonder if you have ever experienced this? I was diagnosed with PMR in december 2014. I started with 15 mg of prednisone and my doctor increased the dose to 20 mg in January. I began my withdrawal 17.5 mg with decreased 1.15 mg thereafter. At 16.25 mg, I felt very bad psychologically (depression, panic disorder with fear of losing control). I was scared! This morning I rose to 17.5 mg telling me that I might be decreased too fast. I try to slowly diminish. Have you ever felt a psychological malaise trying weaning?  I feel better than yesterday but I feel fragile in my mind.  Thanks for your answers !  Have a nice day !

"I am posting this just to provide an update something hopeful for those suffering.  If you search my limited previous posts you can get some more background.
I developed PMR about 21 months ago at the age of 48.  I am a male living in Canada.  My GP suggested I might have PMR, but referred  rheumatologist refused to diagnose me with PMR due to my age, despite all other potential causes of my pain and stiffness being discounted through extensive testing.  He would not prescribe pred without that diagnosis - he did at one time prescribe a drug commonly use for nerve pain - even though I did not have fibro symptoms. 
Pain and stiffness was the worst for the first 8 months or so (could barely lift my legs off the floor when sitting, could not lay on my side, and could not get on the floor to play with my child).
Prior to PMR I was in excellent physical condition, and a regular attendee at a crossfit gym.  I will also add that I had experienced inflammation of the carotid artery that went away on its own over a week or so, a while prior to PMR symptoms. I can't help but think there is a link. My PMR first showed up as extremely stiff hamstrings, followed by stiffness and pain in the neck and shoulders.  It tended to change in severity over these locations over time.
I treated myself with 800mg of ibuprofen daily, which I would normally take at about 2:00 in the morning.  Many say ibuprofen has no effect, but I could not have gotten through those days as I did without it.  When I did not take ibuprofen, the stiffness was much worse, I would then take some and it would improve, so I know it worked for me.  On the other hand, acetominophen had no effect.  I was very mindful during this time of any potential stomach issues, and was extremely sensitive to any pain I thought could be related to GCA.
I began to improve slowly but steadily after about eight months and reduced ibuprofen gradually to 200mg per day.  About 4 or 5 mojths ago I switched to naproxen (220mg/day), and this worked quite well, maybe better than ibuprofen. 
I will add that in my own desperate search for natural cures I used mangosteen juice and pills, and pycnogenol, but I stopped taking those a month or so ago and don't feel any different, so I can't confirm thye an had any effect on symptoms. I also took about 1800mg high quality fishoil daily (only over the last 6 lmonths or so). 
My blood tests showed consistently lower levels of CRP as my pain and stiffness lessened.  If I recall, it was about 12-14 when I first felt symptoms, and was around 4 or so when I began to feel significantly better.
My last rheumy appt was about two months ago.  I told him I was feeling significantly better.  He basically stated that whatever the mysterious illness was, it solved itself, no more appts needed unless symptoms recurr.
I now have some pain and stiffness in upper hamstrings and occasonally in my shoulders, but shoulder flexifbility is no longer a problem - I can lift my arms over my head no problem, whereas in the beginning, not even close.  I do not normally take any ibuprofen or naproxen now. 
I am very hopeful my symptoms will go away completely as time goes on, and not return or get worse. I also wish everyone with this condition a speedy recovery. 
Thanks also to everyone who contributes to this blog.

"I have been on 7mg pred for over 2 months and have always felt tired and fatigued.  The last few days I have started having aching and pain in my neck, shoulders, arms and upper legs.  Also my hands and fingers.   my right wrist became hot and slightly swollen and painful.  I am hoping that Eileen and Mrs O will read this and be able to advise me if I am having a flare up.  I do not want to increase my pred unless i really have to as I get so many side effects.   I would be very grateful for your advice and also from anyone else who is going through the same thing.  I am waiting for my latest blood test results because my vitamin D is borderline at 45.   Thank you in advance for your help.

"maybe a silly question - when my leg swelled up Doctor suggested a couple of days of 25mg pred then back to 6mg. Not long enough at higher dose for side effects or need to re-taper. Occasionally I do things which aggravate muscles so I relax for a few days. Has anyone tried very short term increase in dose to preempt any effects from increased activity?
Not a recommendation. Just wondering.

"Hi
I have been on pred for pmr for 2.1/2 years, started on 40mg and am down to 9.5 this morning. My bloods are apparently normal, so no reason not to reduce pred. The trouble is I have now got a very unstable spine, keep 'slipping' discs, so painful, almost worse than the original pmr. I am pretty much unable to do anything, my back goes into spasm when I cant breathe. My rheumy has signed me off with the decision that remaining aches and pains are arthritis related and a referral to the pain clinic. The physio has given me some help and feels that it's the long term steroids that have left my muscles unable to support the spine adequately. Has anyone else had this problem?

"I remain confused as to what is going on with me.  I know that many of my PMR symptoms are well controlled by the prednisone, but the stiffness and pain I have on each side of my spine from below my waist to my shoulder blades puzzles me.  At first I thought it was something other than PMR, then thought it was PMR.  Now wonder if it truly could be a flare of PMR.  Am on 15 mg of pred and afraid to go down.  My doc has given me 1 mg tablets so I can reduce by .5 mg to 1 mg when I decide to.  Even just sitting typing this post has my back starting to stiffen and throb.  Don't see my doc until July.  Yesterday just picking spent blossums off my petunias had my back aching.  Can't seem to do much at all involving any bending.  Sometimes just walking makes my back muscles, ribcage muscles stomach and abs tighten and get stiff and I get out of breath easily.  Yikes!!

"my doctor refuses to give me charged Prednisolone. Having been on them for eighteen months I am experiencing some nasty acid stomach symptoms after taking them early in the morning. It gets worse as the day goes on. I gave up Omneprazol because that too was giving me really nasty side effects... Worse than indegestion ! Today I emptied a capsule of the no longer wanted Omneprasol slow release beads and put my Prednisolne tablets inside. I took it with the usual early morning lactofre milk and dry crackers..... After two hours I still have none of the usual burning pain or acid throat that I normally get from this.... Let's hope it does not affect the action of the Preds but hey! Hopefully I am going to have a nice day.
i feel that my doctor refusing to give me coated tablets is cruel and if this experiment works I am definitely going to take that and many other complaints to whoever might listen.

"have been on pred for 9 months started at 15 now down to 8, for the last couple of months about 5pm when cooking supper have awful pain in my hip buttock area, told rheumy about it, he did not really comment then on saturday out of the blue pain so bad and this time travelled down to my foot, could not stand on it at all, rested until monday morning no better phoned rheumy, he was completely booked up phoned hip specialist as had have this same thing happen before being diagnosed with PMG, he was puzzled as had not been feeling well had stopped taking statins as felt my joints hurting a lot, he x rayed hips they were fine, I told him I had the same thing happen 2 years before when in Florida had injection and it was goe within 5 hours, this time he really did not know but said it obviously could be PMG, he organised me to have steroid injection immediately as I was in a wheel chair as the pain was unberievable, but if I went in a crouch position and tried to walk the pain was gone but the moment I stood upright it was terrible, after the injection he told me it would take a week or so to reach its peak, it is slightly better today, I am so lucky as I belong to Bupa so get seen quickly, really dont know how I would cope under normal circumstances. Phoned Rheumy sec to ask him if I should upp my dose, she phoned back and said no but to wait a week or so and see how  things go, do you think this was a flare?

"Hello
Not really sure if Im in the right place but here goes..
I have suffered with hip pain since a child they click, was told they weren't developed properly, sometimes i have to retract my leg because i feels if I go any further forward something will snap, when this happens I get an extreme sharp pain.
I am now 33 had two children which was an experience when in child birth not being able to extend the hips very well.
The last couple of years I have now developed lower back pain, knee pain along with flare of knuckle and elbow.
I have good days and not so good, the last couple of days have been awful, bought on by a simple cold, it seems to hit me with all its force.
I have been back and forth to the doctor but they wont even give me anything for the pain apart from paracetamol/ibruprofen which does nothing anymore.
I have seen a physiotherapist at the hospital who got an mri done of the lumbar spine and saral iliac joints T1 T2 and stir sequences, additional diffusion-weighted sequences of the sacro iliac joints....
this was the results (or lack of)
The lumbar spine series incorporates the D8 thoractic vertebra down to the sacrum taking the lowest fully mobile disc space to be L5/S1.
There is normal bony alignment with no evidence of abnormal marrow signal or significant osteophytosis. The discs are unremarkable throughout. The conus lies at D12 and returns normal signal.
There is no convincing evidence of diffusion-weighted abnormality or significant sclerosis to suggest sacroilitis.
The uterus is incidently retro flexed.
Conclusion..Unremarkable lumbar spine and sacral iliac joints.
So I am left in limbo really as I dont know what is wrong and this shows nothing.
I have pain everyday which I cope with but when a flare up comes then it really does effect me, the pain is unbearable, I cant do anything apart from cry.
The latest one started mid back down to lower back the whole of it, breathing hurt, I couldn't ease it with any position, it went into the hips, mainly up in the groin and then progressed into the knees. Made me feel so sick.
I cant explain well enough really, but it is pain but a constant one not a shooting pain but constant, it kind of feels like labour obviously not contractions but always there.
I just dont know what to do, and feel the doctors dont believe me.
Does anyone have any insight/idea?
Sorry if this isnt in the right place but because i haven't been diagnosed with anything I dont know where to turn to.
Thanks for taking the time to read x

"morning everyone,  figured out I made a really big mistake...  Yesterday after feeling like a feather could knock me over for such a long time ...I thought I was feeling alittle better.  Decided I needed to move some.  I decided to walk on my t-mill. Did an easy 20 mins...did have to push but thought I was just giving in to this extreme fatigue.  Well this morning  as usual I have to walk the dogs !!!  I walk them several times a day. BUT this morning  I could barely get my legs moving plus my arms feel like they're falling off!!
I don't even feel like I'm making sense this morning, my head is foggy . What a fool I am !!  
Well I guess all I can do is wait for this to lessen and hopefully be able to move alittle better later today.  My friends think I just need a change ... Need to get out more... They really do not understand that I can not just walk around the stores and shop as they love to do.  
I do a quick food shop and come home rest and then try to cook something...   Sorry to go on...   Thanks for your support.

"Got a call from my rheumy today that it's now officially official - I have PMR.   After discovering this board, I was certain of the diagnosis weeks ago.   I guess I should be thankful that she is very thorough and ran tests that ruled out RA, hepatitis, STDs and cancer.  
I was very resistant to taking Pred due to severe side effects I experienced 30 years ago (for allergies) until she could absolutely tell me that it was def PMR.  I've been on 6MG oral after receiving localized injections on March 4.  I hate the effects of even that low dose.  I feel puffy and swollen and agitated and like I want to cry all the tIme.  I sleep an average of 3-4 fitful restless hours per night.  
Doc insists I have to start 10MG beginning tomorrow because of the high WBC, sed rate and high CRP and the inflammation that shows clearly on the MRI on my shoulder.   I realize this is still a comparatively low dose, but I'm feeling really down because I feel the more oral Pred that I'm required to take, the more I will ""need"".  
I walked 6.39 miles today on a beautiful trail with waterfalls and wildlife.  I took all last week off work and rested and slept and exercised and tried to de-stress.  
I keep thinking I am too young for this awful crap and this d!%# disorder should just leave us all alone and go away.  
I only read stories of people who are suffering terribly with PMR/GCA.  Sitting here at 10:00 PM tonight (my own pity party) I feel quite miserable.
Does anyone ever get over this and get back to 'normal'? I cannot imagine feeling like this for many more months or years to come.

"I was reading another post and helenemiles and Eileen were talking about pain in their big toes. Since I've never posted before and those comments caught my attention, I thought this might be a good time to share my personal PMR journey. I've read so many of yours and they've helped me, so maybe mine will help someone else know they aren't alone either. Speaking of toes, my first symptom (in hindsight, because at the time I couldn't figure out what was going on), was sudden onset severe pain in the base joint of my left big toe. That lasted a few weeks, and during that time, while out on a walk, my left calf cramped up. At least I thought it was a cramp, but it never went away. After 3 months & numerous trips to the doctor, and not finding out what it was, it eased up. Then my big toe joint suddenly started hurting again. I thought I might have gout or something, but x-rays & blood tests for gout showed nothing.  Then I blew out a disk in my back and ended up have a fusion a year ago in January. After surgery I felt great and was doing wonderfully on my rehab, even walking 3 miles a day 5 wks post-op. Then I went to bed one night feeling fine, and woke up not fine. The pain in my calf muscle was back and way worse than before. Then my neck, left shoulder and muscles in my upper left arm started to hurt. I felt like I was falling apart. My back surgeon suspected a blood clot, but an ultrasound showed it was okay. I had MRS's on my back, hip, and knee and an EMG on my back and leg and everything came back negative. I was beginning to think I was going nuts. I started PT and nothing there helped either. My PT found a big knot in my calf that would NOT go away no matter what. He and another PT he consulted with thought it sounded like a myofascial problem, but it wouldn't respond to anything & it was horribly painful. Also during all this, I started seeing my chiropractor for my neck & he couldn’t tell if this was coming from my shoulder or neck, as both seemed to be involved and all the muscles in both were spasmed up. With chiropractic they gradually felt better, but still came and went some. Those didn’t hurt as bad as my calf, so that was my first priority to treat. Then suddenly, last July, the pain in my calf slowly diminished and went away over the course of a few days, but at the same time I developed bilateral groin pain. That became so severe that I couldn't even stand to wear underwear because even the touch of the elastic was more than I could bear. Then the pain starting in my upper leg muscles too. I ended up in Urgent Care because I couldn't stand the pain, and they had no idea what was wrong with me. I think they were trying to find anything to do for me, so they put me on a Medrol dose pack thinking it was probably still stemming from my back. By the next morning I was feeling pretty good and I had a good 4 days, then it all started back in again and in addition, my hips and buttock muscles were also stiff and sore. Then about a week later my right shoulder joint started to hurt and then the upper arm muscles too. I was noticing that I hurt more when I went to bed and for the first couple of hours after I got up. I had NO appetite, and I would spend most of my nights up walking the house because it hurt too much to go to bed. During all this, I tried to do my normal daily walk, but I was kind of shuffling because I hurt so much, and I caught my toe on a root and twisted my left knee and tore my medial meniscus. This was just about more than I could take. I'm a VERY active and physically fit 58 yr. old woman and I felt like my life was crashing in on me. I was so sore everywhere that I scheduled a therapeutic massage. Normally I LOVE a deep massage, but I could hardly stand to have him touch my muscles and I don’t think there was a spot on my body that didn’t hurt. He couldn’t even figure out why I was such a mess, but he worked on me for 2 hrs. and had me come back for two more massages. Each time I came in, I was in just as bad of shape as the time before & it was horribly painful.  I finally gave up and decided that they weren’t going to help me. I didn’t know what to do to get relief at that point because I didn’t know what was wrong and if I told anyone I was sure they would think I was a crazy hypochondriac . A few days before my pre-op appt to have my knee repaired, I was sitting at home one evening and I suddenly felt like I was getting sick, kind of nauseated, chills & fever, and then the weirdest thing I've ever felt in my life happened. The pain in my right shoulder migrated across my collar bone and into my left shoulder too. I had no idea what was happening to me, but it was very scary. I tried to go to bed, but I couldn't lay down for more than a few minutes due to pain, and when I tried to get up, my arms wouldn't work and it would take me several minutes to be able to even roll over and try to get up. Again, I walked the floors all night. Through all this I literally went for 2 wks with no sleep, I lost 10 lbs., and I looked like death. My pre-op appt for my knee surgery was the next morning, and I told my surgeon I didn't know what was wrong with me and he suggested I make an appt with my GP as it sounded like some kind of myalgia to him. By the time I left his office, I could hardly lift my arms to drive my car. I stopped at my GP's office on the way home and made an appt for the next afternoon. That evening I got up from our couch to go to bed and I couldn't move my arms more than 6 inches from my body. I couldn't even get undressed to go to bed, but I couldn't lay down anyway. Finally at 3 AM I woke my husband up and had him take me to the ER as I was getting really scared. Even after telling all this to the ER doctor, he thought I had rotator cuff syndrome in my right arm and had overcompensated and got my left one involved too. Duh!!!!  I told him I was sure that wasn't it because I was running a low grade fever too for the last few days, and I’d done nothing to hurt my shoulder. Regardless, he still thought that was it. He couldn't give me any anti-inflammatories due to my upcoming surgery, so he gave me a steroid injection and sent me home still in pain. I was sooo upset!  But wait, after about an hour I realized my shoulders didn't hurt as much and my groin pain was less. Within 4 hours, I couldn't tell anything had been wrong with me. At this point, I had never even heard of PMR, so this didn't make sense to me at all. I went to my doctor that afternoon & I told him I actually felt fine right then, but told him about what was happening. He had some labs drawn and called me the next day to tell me my sed rate was 53. (When my groin pain was at its worst, my sed rate was only 9). He said to come in as soon as I felt up to it after my surgery and we would discuss it. Since all my symptoms were returning right before my meniscus repair, I made sure I was in his office 3 days after surgery to see what in the heck was going on. I had Googled high sed rate to see what that meant and saw PMR as one of the things causing it and looked it up and discovered it was me, so I had a little idea of what the diagnosis was going to be. He started me on 20 mgs Pred on a Friday and I was in to a rheumy the next Tuesday. I didn't respond real well to the 20 mg, so he gave me an injection that day to give me a boost and said to call in 3 days. I was still feeling muscle and joint pain, so be bumped me up to 40 mg and I got immediate relief. Of course, I got every Pred side effect like a VERY upset stomach, my eyes went goofy on me, etc. Got into the eye doctor immediately to make sure we saw no sign of GCA, and have been back again because the eye focusing stuff has continued to be a problem, but now that my pred dose has gone down numerous times, some of that stuff has eased. From about the time my shoulders were affected, I developed the most crushing fatigue I've ever felt. I think I've taken about 2 naps in my lifetime, and all I could do was lay in a lounge chair with my body feeling like a lead weight, and sleep. Luckily, this has eased too and I can at least go for my daily walks, but I learned very quickly that a day of activity means I'm good for nothing the next day. I've always been a night owl too, and now if I don't get things done by about 3 PM, it's not going to get done that day. My social life has definitely gone to pot too, since almost all social functions are at night and by then I don't even want to go. This whole saga started 18 mos. ago and my diagnosis was 7 1/2 months ago. I still have problems that ebb and flow, but I'm learning to deal with it and just trying to be happy I don't have cancer or the MS that my younger sister died from. Having some pain issues in my neck now and in the muscles between my neck and shoulder. I've been listening to all of you and found a Bowen therapist here and have had two sessions. No great results yet, but the muscles have loosened up some.   Sorry to be so long-winded, but I've been lurking and just reading everything posted for a while to get familiar with how this forum works. You have been my best source of information through this whole ordeal and I'm so thankful I found you, since I don't know a soul with PMR. It would be a very lonely journey without reading post and saying ""My body is doing that too!!""

further tests have shown that I have a condition called Haemochromatosis ... A genetic disorder which causes the to absorb an excessive amount of iron from your diet .
 Her initial investigations from blood only has led her to conclude that there are no signs of rhea motion arthritis for instance .
i am being referred to a haematologist for assessment and best treatment options.
I have not fully researched this condition , but I do still feel that I have presented with symptoms of PMR .
my Dexa scan is on the 13th May , MRI scan of lower back and pelvis 29th of this month .
from the info I have looked at briefly I'm not convinced that this condition would of attacked my body in such a way .......

"I have had PMR for 14months. Started on 15 mgms prednisilone pain free since then. I had a flare a month ago and had to increase dose to 10mgms from the 5mgms I had reduced to. My main problem is poor balance. I do walk every day.
My other problem is driving...I have always been a confident driver
now I am not so keen , and sometimes have a panic attack. I
just pull in when this happens. Don't know if this is caused by
PMR  or a side effect from the steroids. Anyone else have similar experience?
Thank-you for reading

"Morning,
i am am hoping that someone may be able to provide some feedback for me if possible.
i was diagnosed last October ( I am now aged 50) and initially I was off work until mid January. I then went back to work on a phased return until I was doing a five day week. 
Unfortunately that hat has not lasted very long and I away signed off again two weeks ago and due to return to work this Tuesday even although I do not feel any better.
my first question is, is this typical of others with this condition, I'm worried that it might be me not trying hard enough or am just lazy ( until I got this nobody could ever say I was lazy)
my second question is, does anyone else find that in the morning it can be sore to walk because of really bad pains in the feet and hips ?  In addition I find that until the afternoon my neck and back are also painful.
any feedback that anyone can provide would be appreciated. 
Thanks, George.

"okay, now that i have my right foot in a lace up boot because of Posterior Tibial Tendonitis-it really, really, really, hurts- I need to decide what pain killers to take. My docs seem to think tylenol is nifty, but it doesn't do squat for swollen, painful tendons. I might as well go to the local faith healer. so here's my question: I noticed that NSAIDS and prednisone have ""moderate"" interaction warnings, which is probably why they suggested tylenol (and prescription vicodin). I'm probably especially prone to it given i'm still on a liquid diet due to the prednisone and already suffer gastrointestinal issues, etc. no sense adding to the volcano.
I'm wondering if any of you folks take NSAIDS with your prednisone and whether your docs warned you of the possible interactions. I have to admit to having cheated and taken a small swig of my kid's children's ibuprofen bottle...couldn't stand the pain any longer. so sad. I just wanted pain reduction without going to sleep (vicodin knocks me out).

"As some of you know, I've been seriously thinking about my work and whether I should retire.
Well, I made the call to my boss on Monday and am now officially retired, or at least I will be on 25 May when my notice period ends. I won't be going back to work at all, even though I have no sick certificate (thanks to lack of care at my surgery and I will be changing surgery as soon as I've had my blood test there next week).
I am just going in to work for a formal goodbye (oh dear, I don't like those formal presentations and tearful goodbyes) and a handover with new person in due course. Lunch with a few colleagues next week also.
Funnily enough, I'm ok about it, sort of. Having been at home for so long, work is quite removed in my mind. I'm also really going to concentrate on my painting, something other artists have really encouraged me about, having seen some of my work and I've booked a 14 week course of 3 hours per week, starting mid June. By then, I hope to be feeling more relaxed and fit to go out more. I'm really excited about being able to develop my skills and am busy networking online.
So, overall feeling good about being retired. As a friend said to me, be thankful that you had that wonderful job, it was a special experience.

"Hi Everyone,  I was so tired this moring I was sorely tempted to cancel my drs. appt.  Anyway, it was to see how I was getting on with A Acid, which I haven't taken.  So that was the so called ""new medication"".  I didn't get off to a good start this morning, I was so tired but I pushed through it and drove to drs.  My appt was 10am but they didn't have me on the system at all for appt.  Then I had to wait ages and ages, then after an hour I was called by the locum dr.  The so called new medication was to see how I getting on with A Acid and then I informed her that I wasn't taking it and the reason why.  She told me the pros and cons and that there were 3 ways to take it.  The weekly one, or a daily one or a yearly one through a drip (that may not be right, as I was too tired to listen)  She was nice enough and told me that the steroids would definitely lead to osteoperosis even if a dexa scan was taken and bone density was normal, because of the long term use as well as the high dose.  I told her I would considerate it sometime when my dental work was finished.
It's either take the AA to prevent loss of bone or don't take it and let PMR damage the muscles (I think) I was just too tired to care about what she was saying.  She gave me two websites to look up - this being one of them and another electronic medicines compendium (PIL) Patient information leaflet.  Just thought I would keep you all in the loop about the new medication which is not new.  Is anyone on this AA?  What is the dosage? Also woke up with a red dot in my left eye.  She said it was subduc (I cannot think straight)  Sorry to disappoint anyone about the not so new AA.  Any comments welcome and thanks in advance.

"Hello all,
Having just finished helping our youngest daughter move, I spent some time last night wondering about why I felt the way I felt during the move.
I was a very active, energetic, and fit person until I contracted PMR.  I'm a 67 year-old man and am trying to be as active as possible in spite of the PMR.
Yesterday, before prednisone ""kicked-in,"" I think I scared everyone with my huffing and puffing.  I was better in the afternoon, but in the morning I was exhausted and out of breath -- A LOT.  So here is my question:
If the pain of PMR is coming from an inflammation of the blood vessels, and if that inflammation swells the blood vessels and therefore restricts flow, are we endangering ourselves -- especially our hearts, by exercising?
Thanks for your input ahead of time.

Having started to slowly reduce the Pred I'm happy to say I'm now down to 30 mg a day ( not low I admit) and this seems to be ok for now, I have had no GCA repercussions but have had a few Pred side effects, mainly my lovely chubby cheeks ( good job I wasn't skinny to start with) and I get the shakes now and then!
But I have managed to return to work ( I have a fantastic head teacher) completing a full week, I have to admit by Thursday I was feeling tired and Saturday I did sleep a lot!!
I do think I am one of the lucky ones at the moment having read some horror stories about Pred, my doctor just said to me that I'm lucky Pred is my friend and I seem to respond better than many on it , so I am feeling great full just now

whatever. I give up. I mean I haven't worked out except on the wussy little trampoline and I do it for  10 min at a time, at most 3x a day. And I don't jump (heartburn), but I step. And I have the proper shoes, blah, blah, blah. I haven't even been back to the gym since last week's ""first trip to the gym"".  So sad. And so somehow I managed to strain it (thank you prednisone! I read it makes you more susceptible to this type of injury).  At least, according to the stuff online, it doesn't appear that I have ruptured the tendon.

I don't know whether to taper to 14.5 mg or to 14 mg prednisone as my first taper.  I have all the guidelines from the forum to help me with the timing of the taper, and I know that I shouldn't reduce by more than 10%.  However, I want to be really cautious and make sure I don't have increased pain returning as a result of a taper.  Would it make sense to decrease by only 1/2 mg at a time?

"As you all may know, Prednisone and I haven't had the best relationship. Since I was diagnosed with GCA with my biopsy Jan 2, 2015, I've pretty much hit every side effect that you can have. This trend has continued now that I've started tapering. I'm on 45mg now and have developed some new and weird symptoms that I'd like your opinion on.
First one to pop up were a series of tiny red spots on my legs, which then spread to my arms and torso. They vary in size but they're no bigger than 4mm (roughly a bit larger than 1/8in) and they're flat. They don't itch. At first I thought they might be some sort of skin infection, so i used an antibacterial soap but that did absolutely nothing. 
I've also had extra swelling around my eyes and my eyes are running day and night. 
I feel nauseous at times, but haven't thrown up anything except this morning I threw up my prednisone (and rightly so!) I took it again and it stayed down. 
I'm still on a mostly liquid diet (protein smoothy that I make) and I eat one small meal at dinner ( this is due to the heartburn caused by the prednisone). At the moment I now have what I'd call borderline diarrhea (not quite diarrhea but almost). This started when I moved from 50mg to 45 mg. diet hasn't changed. still the same lovely protein smooties.
I've had no symptoms of my GCA (yay!)  I'm wondering if this is just ""normal"" for some of us tapering from prednisone or whether I need to see the doc.  
have I said how much I really hate this drug?

"I want to thank everyone for their kind and helpful remarks concerning what I wrote about this.
My seriously depressed daughter was paying for psychotherapy until she used up every bit of her savings, retirement funds, etc. But then, remarkably enough, her fine therapist said he would see her for nothing. And he does and she likes him a lot, and I'm very grateful for that.
She was on antidepressives for a while, when she still had money to pay and was seeing a psychiatrist for the pills, but once the money ran out, so did the psychiatrist visits and pills. (I don't think she ever missed him or them, which is good.)
Luckily, I also have an excellent psychotherapist for visits which are free to me because of Medicare, thank God. She is tremendously helpful and I am trying hard to deal with the hand that has been dealt me. I live in a Co-op and some time ago wrote to ask if the monthly co-op fee could be held back for a few months until my daughter is able to find a job. I keep hoping that will be within six months...................The co-op people have not yet answered, and I need to inquire why not. I will do that.
A lot of appreciation, again, for all your help and concern.

"I think serious stress is at the root of many if not all PMR diagnoses--I know it's true in my own case. I'm trying to deal with stress as I engage in slow, slow reductions of pred, but it's extremely difficult. The stress is largely caused because I am becoming poverty-stricken resulting from a severely, clinically depressed grown-up child quitting her job and moving in with me. She is unable even to look for a job and obviously has no income to contribute to the household.  It's a tough one, at my age of 85. 
Any others out there struggling with massive stress underlying PMR?

"Hi All,  I have not been able to talk or listen alot lately~  Too many doctors appointments! lol  Unfourtunetly its true!
 I went  to new Rhuemy here in Florida, He dosen't think I have Pmr, and has cut me down from 4mg  2x a day of Medrol, to slowly come down 1mg....about 8 months till off.  He also sent me to Physical therapy 3x a week. Too help my VERY weak upper arms.  He thinks that my sed rate was not ever that high?  It was 32 at its highest.  I don't know the difference you use in Britain~   
 Then I went to allergist, who told me a plan to come off this medrol in 8 weeks!  so He can do allergy tests?
 Now I have to have the full Hystroctomy next tuesday. Done by the new Davinci robot.
Then I went to My gp/regular Doctor, who said you have to come off the steriods now, in order to have this surgery, they don't want me to have an infection/low immune system. He said just do 8,7,6,5 etc in a few weeks you'll be off them.
Do you beleive all this!  Anyway, does anyone know if its ok to have this surgery/ or any, while on steriods?  I am in last stage before cancer sets in, and need this done now.  Today I go see Gp again, will get New blood results fro Lupus, Lyme diseae, etc, they are testing me for everything.   I also Had x-rays of both shoulders, and will learn about them today too.
 also I have been on this new diet plan who promises to beat this auto immune disease.  Its called Auto immune Paleo Diet.  Has anyone ever heard of this?  They say PMR is all caused from eating incorrectly and I have a leaky gut!
  I am so confused about everything!  Worried too about surgery this tuesday the 28th.
 Im hoping Eileen and you all, can please try to answer all these questions.  I really do appricate it, Thank u all, and Bless your hearts~  Marie

"Eileen has said many times that about a quarter of people get off Pred in about 2 years, about half take 4-6 years and about a quarter take more than 6 years (or remain on Pred indefinately). 
Recently in the Thanks To All topic Charlie44644 said that stats give about an 80% chance of being done with PMR in 2 years. 
I am wondering about the source of these numbers?
As my GP is always trying to rush me off Pred it would be helpful if I could give him the research papers about this so that he would be better at letting me go my own pace.   When I was first diagnosed he told me I would be on Pred for just a few months so he is not comfortable keeping me on it, which is now almost 2 1/2 years.

"Having answered Snapperblue's discussion 3/4 days ago, as follows:
""Hello.  I too have only recently been diagnosed, and therefore coming upon this site and reading yours and the other comments has been very helpful.   For several months my very painful hips, neck and shoulder have been put down to arthritis, as I already have had this in knees and feet for several years.  However, the pain and stiffness was getting so bad that I drew sketch diagrams of my body and marked clearly in red where all the pain was and showed these to my GP.   He straight away suspected PMR and requested blood tests, but these were not very conclusive.   However, on 07.01.15. he started me on 15mg Predisolone, and led me to believe that I should be feeling wonderful in a few days!   After 4 days, I must admit I did feel a lot better but one week later, 14.01.15., my pain is back with a vengeance.    It is most encouraging to read that the commencing dose of 15mg  is not strong enough for some people - so I shall report back to my GP, and see if he will increase it.    Many thanks.""
Now, having received some very helpful replies from several people, in particular Christina66394 and EileenH, I have decided to start my own discussion.
I must admit EileenH that having started on the Pred, and feeling better, I have not ""overdone things"", but equally well, I have just carried on with my normal life without trying to pace myself and rest more.
I went back to  my GP, Christina66394, and he has increased the Pred dose to 25mg, which I  started on yesterday.   (So, 15mg from 7 January, increased to 25mg on 17 January).  I must admit the stiffness is considerably better, but I still have quite a lot of pain around my hips and top of thighs.   However, I have had the pain for a long time, so, in my opinion, I can't really expect the inflammation to disappear overnight - can I?
I have also found all the discussion regarding weight gain and diet of great interest.   Like Christina66394 I have been more than 3stone overweight for probably 5/6 years now, and therefore am hoping that the Pred will not increase this even more.   I think I must investigate ""inflammatory foods"" online, and endeavour to start myself on a diet cutting down carbs.
Also EileenH, I was very interested in your comments about balance and PMR.   For a long time my balance has not been good, and I thought it was simply because I am overweight.   Now I am wondering if it is yet another of my PMR symptoms - which to my mind seems more likely.
I really appreciate these discussions, and am so pleased I found this site.  Thank you to everyone who has answered me, and please keep giving me the help, advice and comments.   I am a ""new girl"" in the PMR diagnosis, so need all the help I can get in managing my condition.

"I have GCA & have started reducing Pred from 60mg for the 2nd time since October/November 2014.
My Rheumy was trying a longer plateau - (July >  October 2014)  on 60mg this time as my current GCA is a recurrence (with more severe symptoms than the previous attack.- 2011/12.).
I reduced to 50mg just over a week ago after i month back up to 60 again and 2 weeks completely free from GCA symptoms.
I experienced 6 days of, what I assume were, withdrawal symptoms - ordinary headache/fluey feeling/ stomach discomfort/loss of appetite and fleeting pains & twinges echoing all the original pain & discomfort of GCA. symptoms..I have felt well for the last 2 days, but still having twinges & ""echoes"" in all the same places as the original symptoms.
Can you feel my anxiety from where YOU are?
Has anyone else experienced this, especially the milder versions of the symptoms?
I'm wondering if the inflammation is still there - and if 50mg is enough to calm that down whilst I wait for things to settle before making the next move?
This has been one of my main concerns over teh last few years. I've never really felt well on the tapering down & am trying to avoid a repetition of that. 
I felt well before tapeing to 50 this time, only concerned that I felt the symptoms returning afterwards, even though they were much milder and occasionally.

"I'm new at this PMR thing.  Diagnosed in March.  Have had days where I feel ""almost"" normal.  Then get kicked back to feeling like a train wreck.   
Now I have this swollen vein at the base of my right thumb where the pulse is.  Looks like a small marble and is sensitive to touch.  I have neck/clavicle/shoulder movement pain that gets really bad on the bad days.  Is this the PMR or something else?
Im taking only 6MG Pred a day which I know is quite low, I feel it is a trade-off to have some bad -day PMR pain and discomfort in exchange for the lesser Pred side effects (which have been severe for me in the past when used to treat bad allergies). 
I hate this.   I just want to feel like ""me"" again.  
I'm so sorry for all of you who are struggling with this.  If I'm feeling this miserable, I can't imagine what you are going through.

So then we get home and I realize I have a cold-it hits me like a bus since my body is exhausted. Still, I had things to do, right? No rest for mommies. Easter coming, lots of preparations. Then one day I’m preparing dinner and I sliced off the tip of my index finger while cutting carrots. More body trauma. On the plus side, I think all the gabapentin I take for my neuropathy really helped control the initial pain. So then I spend about a week in real pain, drugged up, refusing to look at my really ugly, icky finger. Btw my 10 year old saved the hacked off part and is “mummifying” it naturally in colorado’s heat in my living room-so gross. I’m now off painkillers for the finger, it looks pretty good now and is healing.
Throughout all this I decided I wasn’t going to back off my tapering schedule. I’d held off while traveling, but felt I should taper upon return. Yeah, smart. So it didn’t really feel “good” tapering from 55mg to 50, but hey, I felt like crap anyway and was on vicodin so …
I’m now on 45 mg. I went to the gym to “work out” for the first time this week, which consisted of 45 min on a treadmill (walking pretty gradually up to a max speed of 2.6mi/hr-whew!). I did not feel worse than before I got on the treadmill, other than my bruised ego as I watched much older people blow past me in their physical endeavors.
I do have a few questions about a few weird things that have cropped up, but I’ll post them separately.  I look forward to catching up on all that has happened the past month-hope everyone is okay.

"Had booked a telephone call for today with the GP, who previously signed me with no problem, as my certificate ran out yesterday. She promptly called, sounding rather frosty.
I explained that I needed to be signed off still, New medication being considered, flare recently etc etc. Well, she told me there was nothing on my file from rheumy to that effect and as I was a PA, instead of sitting at home, no doubt making cups of tea, emptying the dishwasher etc, I could just as well be at work!
I tried to explain again, thinking she had forgotten I have HAD, but no, she said that in fact she would have to sign me back to work, and I must realise that sick certificates are legal documents (not sure about that one!).
So, I have left a message with rheumy' s Secretary, asking him to fax the surgery telling them I need to be signed off. It's enough to make me weep, or scream!
The trouble is my rheumy us due to be away and I'm not sure exactly when that is. Will give it until tomorrow.

"DJ Green, S Muller, CD Mallen, and SL Hider posted online on November 4, 2014
Objectives: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the commonest inflammatory disorder of older adults. Although not part of the recently published classification criteria, patients with PMR frequently complain of fatigue. We compared consultation for fatigue and sleep problems between individuals with and without PMR.
Method: Consulters receiving a Read-coded diagnosis of PMR at nine general practices between 2000 and 2009 were matched by age, gender, general practice, and year of consultation to four patients without PMR. Fatigue and sleep problems were defined using Read codes. Cox regression was used to determine the association between PMR diagnosis and consultation for a fatigue/sleep problem.
Results: In total, 549 PMR patients were identified. Their mean (SD) age was 73.9 (8.6) years and 71% of the participants were female. Prior to the index date, 33 PMR patients and 80 matched non-PMR patients consulted with fatigue (0.43 vs. 0.25 consultations per 10 000 person-years, p = 0.006). PMR was associated with significantly more multiple fatigue consultations in the 12 months before PMR diagnosis [hazard ratio (HR) 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–3.08]; no significant difference was seen in rates of consultations for sleep problems between patients with and without PMR.
Conclusions: PMR patients were significantly more likely to have had multiple fatigue consultations before being diagnosed with PMR. Given the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines seen in PMR, this fatigue may represent a prodromal phase prior to consulting with more classical musculoskeletal symptoms. This suggests that clinicians should consider PMR as a potential diagnosis in older patients consulting with fatigue.

"PMR or not PMR ??
I had my appointment with the rheumatologist this morning who despite the registrars thoughts 2 weeks ago is not convinced that I am presenting with PMR ....... 
The contradicticting factor being  inflamation levels (not sure if that's the correct technical term ) was back to normal , but this could be as a result of the steroids !!
My age !!!!! This I did find a little hard to understand , as we are all do very different !! 
my bodies response to pred within 24 hours and the dramatic deterioration when reduced from 20 to 15 within a 24 hour period . 
Now bit of a mystery of which I am left feeling more helpless and alien like !!
she has ran more detailed bloods : thyroid function , liver function , repeated vit d' vit c , FBC ...
MRI of my lower back and Dexa bone scan 
she also wondered if early menspsuse (2011) completion could be a contributing factor , or viral infection !!!!!
help .......
all I know is that I feel rubbish ... My body has changed , the symptoms have crept up over time ... Crashed 2 weeks ago 
pred has made a dramatic difference in the pain to my elbows , deep shoulders and back .
i am now exhausted , learning to go with the flow ,and manage the muscle pains that have gripped me following the completion of the most simplest tasks .... So frustrating ... Like doing an hour weight lifting just lifting the kettle !!! 
have booked a session with a Bowen therapist for Thursday as I hope it will help with the neck and lower back pain that that I has been lingering .

"Im sure I've missed the important questions about side effects that I'm asking about today, but I do need to update my thinking and attitude. 
As one gets their dose going down from the 15 range to under 10 and to the range where the glands are asked to contribute, is there a visible reduction in some of more disturbing problems such as in my case when hand tremor makes it hard to hold a fork still or write a good signature. My other bothersome one is the protruding upper abdomen. My weight gain is minimal. Of course depression and irritability are a now and then I could do without. Generally I consider myself fortunate compared to what some of you endure.

"We know that Giant Cells in GCA causes inflammation of the arteries and we know that we don't know the cause of auto-immune illness. However, there needs to be more research into finding inflammation in the muscles, if there is any, because it would appear from new research that the inflammation in PMR appears to be in the joints because they cannot find inflammation in the muscles. IN GCA they have found in autopsies, where people have left their body to medical science, that even 10 years after first symptoms, Giant Cells are still present in the arteries. I don't mind leaving my body to medical science but there seem to be very few studies that offer this information.

"like a billion people have said before, I am so happy to have found your site. I'm 53 and was a happy active person who went to the gym 3x a week (though plump), an organic dairy free vegetarian, blah, blah, blah. This Christmas 2014 my 10 year old has the flu, I get what i think is the flu and boom, that's the end. she notices a bump on my left temple and for some strange reason I actually went to the doctor, probably because the headache i have isn't at all like my normal migraines. December 30, the doc says, ""steroids and biopsy now"", so Jan 2 2015 I went into surgery. Confirmed GCA. Steroids have hit me hard. Within I couldn't walk. Acute Corticosteroid-induced Myopathy, severe Reflux and inability to eat, racing heartbeat, and about 20 other side effects. I'm now on a smoothie diet. Working on my own and with a PT, I'm now able to walk a bit. Dietician has helped with the smoothie. GCA pain is still coming and going, but the prednisone has triggered some neuralgia/neuritis so that every single nerve is flaired on my head, left and right side. So the doctors have prescribed Gabapentin, an awfully ""fun"" drug. Tremors, shaking, hard to focus, eye problems, on top of the prednisone issues, yes, I'm a mess. Fun, fun, fun every day! Oh and both cause edema, sleep issues, memory issues. I'm lots of fun to have a conversation with these days.

This doesn't make sense to me, as I decreased by 1 mg at a time 3 years ago. Her reasoning was that my sdimentation rate and crp came down more quickly this time. I think this will be a disaster Eileen what do you think? She mentioned I might not have PMR . She is a nurse practioner in practice with the rheumy. I just cut my dose to 10 mg and have more pain than before. Aching cramping sensation in left shoulder, biceps,left firearm, and across upper buttocks--sacroiliac area bilateral. I am so confused. I thought the purpose of the Pred was to bring these values down and control pain., I told her today I would go to 7.5 but I don' t feel good about it. Thank you. Pat

It is really upsetting I am feeling absolutely drained and despondant. I work from home mostly so I can care for him but he makes this very difficult. Without the work I could not pay the rent or bills even though we have a small subsidy....Sorry to moan and be miserable but there is no one else who seems to care or understand....even my own children have no idea how awful this situation is.I have recently been put in touch with a 'buddie' group who will find him a friend which may give me an afternoon a month of relief... however even that would be marvelous!.

"hi, I haven't been to my GP yet as I hate going to the doctors but I feel I now need to after reading all of your letters.  My pain started probably 12 months ago with a deep pain in my left upper arm on moving when I woke and easing during the day. Could not raise it above shoulder level. I now have aches and the same pains in both upper arms and neck muscles and across my shoulder blades, again easing during the day and increasing again in the evening. Strangely I don't know if it is depression but I am beginning to get so bored and although I do a lot of craftwork and painting, I just can't be bothered. I am also weepy. I don't like moaning but I feel better by just discussing it.

"Hi, i was diagnosed a few weeks ago and have been on 15 mg of pred for 21 days now. The pain was excrutiating and got better to begin with but I now have started getting worse pain gradually coming back. My joints are burning hot and im very sore. I have 3 kids, 3,9,11 that keep me very busy and to be honest I struggle to do the basics at times. Mornings are the hardest as Im in pain and have restricted movement but the meds seem to kick in after lunch but I am then struggling to stay awake, often laying on the floor snoozing while my toddler watches tv, before having to pickup the older kids from school and do the ferrying to the sport activities. Are there things I could be doing to help me get through the day a little easier. Im not sleeping well at all and rarely sleep longer then 2 hrs which doesnt help my mood. I dont want to be a grumpy mum but its tough and I dont want my family to suffer as well. I am considering cutting out sugar all together and maybe even trying the paleo diet, anything that may help get me through. Im a the waiting list to see a rhuemy but that will take a while. Any suggestions on issues such as managing sleep, pain and how to better function would be greatly appreciated.

"I am quite happy with my new young female GP. Should one have both?  Can a GP take over with the necessary ESR/CRP blood tests?
  I had seen my Rheumy for nearly 10 years, and he is very busy and gives me less than 15 minutes of his time. Also, he usually wanted me to reduce too fast when I had a RA flare.  Of course the flares became more painful when I was diagnosed with PMR by my GP.  The Rheumy doubted the diagnosis initially. 
He belongs to a big Medical Center here in Portland, OR. where they are very regimented.
I feel I get better care with my new GP. 
Luckily I found this very informative and caring forum.

"So, I had my much anticipated first appointment with the Rheumy today. I'm not sure what to think. She's not too convinced about the PMR diagnosis. Says I'm too young and should have been well by now if it had been. Also do not think I have GCA (age). They have ruled out the ANCA-vasculitides and SLE with blood tests.
I asked about the possibility that it might be Takayasu's instead, and if they would consider a to do some imaging of the arteries. She said she will check my history with a team meeting later today and they would decide how to proceed. Might not be of much use to do that now as I have been on pred too long. Perhaps the only way is to go off the pred all together, wait a few weeks and THEN take new blood tests and do an MRI/CT/whatever. She will contact me next week to let me know.
I feel a bit ""homeless"": back to square one. Hope it's alright with you that I stick around the forum for abit even if I might not have PMR after all. Frankly, I need the your support. Oh, how I would love to have something treatable.

"Apparently the Daily Mail could be some use to us! If you are in the UK this might be of interest to you:
""The Daily Mail is writing an article on GCA, focussing on the need for a quick diagnosis. We realise this is a painful subject, but if anyone has had experience of the problems caused by late (or mis) diagnosis (i.e. sight loss), and would like to share their story, please can you let us know? You can call Sophy at PMRGCAuk on zero three hundred, nine nine nine, fifty, ninety. We want to use this opportunity to create more awareness of GCA, and hopefully persuade the NHS to be more proactive in educating GPs - improving treatment outcomes as a result.""

"Just wanted to say thank you to all who have responded to my messages.
To answer a few questions:  I was sort of Dx'd and started on Pred.  However when I strarted reporting the weakness and because my blood work did not confirm PMR I believe the Rhum. did not believe me.  He referred me back to my Primary or he said ""see a neurologist"".  I will not return to him.  I went back to Primary and felt that she too was not convinced it is PMR but at least she renewed the Pred.  I tried to manage on 4mg a day but couldn't.  She (Primary) I feel reluctantly agreed to 4 mg twice a day; which I am now doing.  The pain is under control except the tooth ache ( saw a dentist,,, no problem with teeth).  My biggest challenge is the overwheming fatique.  I'm not really wanting to increase the Pred.... concerned with the side effects.  Primary says it could raise my blood sugar as well as other effects I have read online. 
  Really not sure how I can handle this if it goes on for years... which I have read.  Thanks again for alll the thoughts.  All the best to everyone.

"Following having to go back up to 40mg Pred after flare up, I saw my rheumy this morning. He had previously told me he thought methotrexate might be the only way for me to get to a low Pred dose.
We discussed it, and also Azathioprine as an alternative, although from reading the two leaflets about them, they seem very similar. Will have to do some research.
Before we decide, I'm having a chest xray and a special blood test Inc TPMT level.
Because I have a fatty liver, it's even more dangerous to take either and would need even more monitoring.
As for tapering, he asked me to try to reduce to 35mg for a week and then to 30. He will send me a tapering plan after that, as he will be away in a few weeks time.
I see him again on 14 May and we will then have the discussion about what meds to take.
I mentioned Prof Dasgupta and he knows him of course and said he was the leading light in PMR/GCA.

"Dear all,
I've been ill 19 years (since age 25) and was dignosed with ME/CFS many years ago. I am now 44 and living in Sweden.
Last summer I had a turn for the worse and together with everything else I could no longer stand for more than a few minutes at a time (weakness and pain). I decided to apply for disability (again). After a scare with a(nother) terrible GP (it's all in your head), I ended up two months ago with a young doctor who immediately said she thoght I had PMR and prescribed prednisone.
It has been a journey since. When I first read about PMR nothing fitted (I'm way too young, have (and have had) many more symptoms, lack some of the others) but as I have read more and followed this forum I have become more and more convinced it's really vasculitis: PMR and probably GCA/TA too. Suddenly everything is coming together. It's just such a relief to finally have been properly diagnosed with something that has a treatment.
Speaking of... I did not react to 30 mg/day but with 40 mg after three weeks it was like lifting a veil. Suddenly after almost 20 years I woke one morning rested. And I could think! I would get up in the morning and just LIVE a whole day. It was amazing for two weeks. And then it passed, and now I'm as bad as usual. I'm still better in some ways (mentally) and falling asleep lots faster, but I am ever so exhaused.
I have an appointment with a specialist next week, but I am so scared. I know it's irrational, but the fear that I will be met with contempt or mistrust is just overwhelming. I am so scared they will say they can't or won't help me. That my GP is wrong (as I do not fit the typical criteria) and that further investigation is useless and that they won't prescribe medication that could help.
It would be too much after having ""tasted"" health after so many years. It would be so cruel. People have assured me that if properly diagnosed and treated I will be completely symptom free. It's almost too good to be true.
I am sorry for this rant, but I really do need all the support I can get and I've seen how wonderful you are with each other. The waiting and anxiety is drivning me crazy.
Thank you for this group, it has helped me lots already.
Love,
Marie

When I asked if we could wait and see....it was NO.  I will find out what I need to know from my GP eg: dexa plus which proposed injection......I only hope I start to feel better, and the Rhemy is right, by me lowering the steroids.

"Today I went to see my GP because although I am managing my PMR symtoms reasonably well I have had the most appalling headache, jaw pain when eating and general pain i my head, scalp ear and back of the neck. I have dizzy spells and worsening tinnitus. I cannot wear my glasses for more than a few moments because of pain I cannot wear my hearing aids for the same reason.
I also had a UTI due to the fact that I have to use catheters and that occasionaly happens.
After sorting the UTI. We discussed the headaches.... Doc said I should not be on such a high dose of Prednisolone 18mg at present and slow reducing as advised by Eileen on this forum. He prescribed alendroic acid again saying I had osteoporosis. I told him I do NOT and he checked back at my test results which showed I had mild osteopenia which was fairly common given my age of 72. No treatment was recommended on that test.
Trying to bring the subject back to headaches Doc told me to go and have my eyes tested ! he also told me to wear my hearing aids to stop the tinnitus. He prescribed a high dose of co-codamol to control the headaches. He avoided any mention of GCA even though back in 2013 that was the immediate diagnosis of my problem with PMR as well.... They gave me 30mg Prednisolone for that which certainly fixed the PMR and the headaches...which were nowhere near as bad as now.
I went tosee the Doc just after Christmas after suffering the headache for 3 weeks after a horrid bout of flue lasting 5 weeks. Was told the tinnitus was age related and because I am partially deaf... my brain was acting up!! the headache was likely to be from sinus after the flue..... I do not have sinusitis or anything like it. I also asked if I could have coated Prednisolone because I was getting a sore tum with the uncoated, I was told to take Omneprazol again which I had stopped due to very bad palpitations and other nasty side effects which stopped immediately I ceased the omneprazol. He refused the coated tablets. I asked for my updated prescription... left the surgery and went to place the order at the desk... Doc had forgotten to put any Prednisolone on the prescription. I had to wait for him to re-do it... when he sent it back he had reduced my daily dose from 18mg to 6mg now that is a drop I have no intention of making. I know the advice will be to change doctors, however it is not possible for me in this area. Any other thoughts on how I can get some sort of advice/help in this case?

"Hi to everyone, got the floors down and doors on, no stress on my part.  I haven't the energy to get stressed.  One thing that I am finding very difficult is my short term memory also trying to find certain words when I am in conversation, it can be so embarassing and very very frustrating.  Is this PMR or the effects of pred.  Would welcome any comments and thank you in advance.  I know we all can go up the stairs for something and when we get there we cannot remember what it was we went up for, or even another room.  But I am finding this is increasing more and more.  I will be in the kitchen at the sink and maybe need a saucepan but as soon as I move and go down the kitchen (it's not that big) I have forgotten what it was I wanted.  Please someone tell me that this is a symptom of PMR or pred.  My mother had dementia and my grandmother and I know this is NOT dementia but sometimes I wonder, but just for a milisecond.

"I was diagnosed with PMR last July, I originally thought I had strained my arms or suffered from stiffness due to old age I am 72. One day I could not get out of bed or even get dressed I could not even get my foot up to the door step, the pain and stiffness got progressively worse.  I was given 8x5ml pred which made a huge difference and I felt really much better and could move with ease. I am now taking 10ml which keeps my fairly even, unless I do too much then the next day I am suffering with stiffness of the limbs. Taking a naproxon tablet sorts me out, and unless I over do it I keep fine. I guess I am luckier than a lot of people who seem to have awful symptoms. I hope that eventually I will recover.  Reading the forum has given me answers to my questions, and it us good to hear other peoples stories. Unless you suffer from PMR you just don't know how it effects your life.

"I have a wonderful chemist who is very supportive and pro-active in looking after his customers.
After my husband picked up my latest prescriptions for me, the chemist asked that I come in for a consultation this morning.
We went through all my meds, when I take them, general health etc.
What came out of it, which I want to share, is that if you take omeprazole, you should take it on its own very first thing in the morning. The acid in your stomach is then clear of drink, meds etc, and it will work so much better. I have now put my tablets by my bed so that I take it as I wake up.
If you happen to also take Alendronic Acid, which has to be taken on an empty stomach, take that on your chosen day, and take the omeprazole when you have a period during the day between meals. As its just one day per week you take the AA, it's more important to get that into your system.
He spent about half an hour with me in his little consulting room, all at his own suggestion. What more can you ask for! (Well, I could ask that my GP Practice was just as supportive, but that's another story).

"I have had PMR for the last 3 and a half yrs. So far, I reduce Prednisolone on a weekly basis by 1mg. My GP almost allows me to self medicate with his overview. If I get a flare up, I up the dose, and then reduce it weekly thereafter.
For the past few months I have been having problems with my left hip. It is very painful, and, I can hear and feel a lot of clicking in the joint. The pain is mainly centre to rear. My GP says he doesn't think it is requiring a joint replacement, and is reluctant to send me for an x ray, becuse of the high dose of radiation involved.

"Am in a quandary about reducing my pred dosage. Have had too many other problems going on requiring help from my GP so PMR does not seem to enter the picture. I started in April 2014 with 30mg prednisolone and eventually decided to reduce the dosage using the suggested method obtained from the Pred group ie 7days 10mg 1 day 9,6days 10mg 1 day 9 etc.  Am now reducing in halves and have reached 4 days 6 1/2 one day 6.Apart from my unrelated problems and feeling pretty tired a lot of the time the PMR does not appear to be causing much of a problem. Am wondering if it would be safe to reduce by 1mg instead of 1/2? Am anxious to get it down as quickly as possible because I have gained almost 3 stone in weight while taking it and am having great difficulty in reducing the weight. Also have apparently developed diabetes and have been told to exclude sugar etc from my diet. On top of that have had a bone scan for suspected problems - all it seems attributable to the pred. Would be grateful for any advice.

"Have had a terrible 3 days. Out of the blue Tuesday night had what I think may be a huge flare. Could not turn over in bed. My teeth were chattering due to the pain. Sore all over. This is the worst I have been. I can't identify anything that may have set this off. I had upped my pred to 15 mgms about 3 days earlier as I wasn't comfortable. I developed a cough on Monday. Had blood tests done on Wednesday included CRP.  Last night I could not sleep had some increased coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath which necessitated me having to sit up in a chair all night. Felt very unwell had a fever too. Over the time I have been on pred I have had this wheeziness and shortness of breath before and am wondering if anyone else has had this problem. I saw GP today who has started me on Antibiotics and wants me to increase the prednisone to 25 mgms for 1 week. I am really worried about doing this as I don't want the wheezing etc to increase if it is the pred. My previous CRP was 8 the results from today for CRP is 85.the highest it has ever been.  Now I understand that it could be high due to the chest infection. But I personally think the wheels have fallen off and the PMR  has flared up. 
Really appreciate your input and experience with pred and wheezing and shortness of breath. I do feel rather fragile and am confined to bed with this bug.
Thank you for your help

"I'm currently on 25mg Pred for GCA. Before I was diagnosed at the end of last year, I was on a maintenance dose of 2.5 for PMA, and as I had some pain in my shoulders then, increased my dose to 5mg.
I'm now on the higher dose and have have had a fair amount of stress due to various things. The thing I'm asking about is, can PMR rear it's head at the level of Pred, or is it GCA? Is my pain in the shoulders and severe lack of muscles in my legs, to the point I can't really walk much, caused by GCA/Pred or has the PMR come back? I know that at the level of Pred I'm on, it shouldn't have, but it feels like it has. The pain across my shoulder feels very much like PMR.
I have had a fair amount of stress lately, but would have though the Pred would have taken care of it.

"After 4 weeks back up to 60mg, I feel so much better and my pain has almost g and I'm waiting forone. I saw a Urologist today who ,s pretty sure that MTX WAS responsible for eGFR crash and Kidney pain I experienced before rheumy temporarily stopped it. A week later my eGFR had risen 10 points.
All bloods (except kidney ones) are now normal or near normal and I'm waiting for rheumy to contact me with instructions,
I've asked him if I can try reducing again WITHOUT the MTX. Urologist has asked me NOT to take it whilst investigations are carried out next week as he feels there's something causing haematuria at the levels I have in my samples. Haematuria also lowers eGFR significantly. So I feel I've been given an opportunity to bargain more effectively with rheumy.
Rheumy hasn't replied yet to my requests - he went off on a mission to consult colleagues and consider other condition with similar symptoms to GCA.
I know I have GCA - it just doesn't fit his idea of what it says in the books. he lost a chunk of my trust at our last appt when he suggested that I should consider that I was making myself anxious, therefore the symptoms could possibly NOT be GCA. I have considered it - properly ( I'm a qualified Psychodynamic Councellor) and I feel betrayed that after all I've been through with him as a caring & helpful rheumy, he destroys it all with this careless and ill thought out, throw away comment.
My thoughts on reducing from 60mg would be to try in 5mg drops for a month at a time and providing I feel well and the symptoms are being managed, move down another 5mg. Rheumy suggested 10mg last time & it was too quick for me.
Do I reduce to the next level in one go or would I introduce the new dose gradually like in the lower doses?
Has anyone else on the Forum experienced difficulty reducing at the higher doses?

"i am new to this site as of about an hour ago--already I have learned a lot.
i live in Minnesota in the US and am 64 years old.  I was diagnosed with PMR in late November last year and started on prednisone by my Internist and referred to a rheumatologist.  The initial high dose (40mg) tapered quickly to 20 and I am now on 6mg for a month and will reduce one mg/ month through the summer.  
My inflammation markers (sed rate and C Reactive Protein) are almost back in the normal range but since I reduced the pred below 10 mg, I have had a persistent ache in my right buttock.  My pain started originally in my hips and thighs.  The Rheumatologist doesn't think the pain is related to the PMR because it is only on one side.  Does anyone else have experience or opinion on this?

I love traveling in our RV and camping in state and national parks with my husband, hiking, walking our Basset Hound, do needle work, attend a water aerobics class, read a lot, etc.  
My first symptoms developed in September with stiffness and pains in legs, thighs and lower back.  Internist thought it might be the Simvastatin and Zetia for lowing cholesterol that I was on, and took me off those,  did multiple blood tests which only showed high muscle enzymes, and put me on heavy dose of Naproxen. The follow up blood test showed the muscle enzymes had dropped.
Then I had an HD flu shot on September 27th, and things got so much worse to the point I could barely walk; terrible pain in my arms and shoulders to the point I could not raise my arms up over my head and barely hold a cup of tea; terrible pain in the backs of my thighs to the point I could not sit down for any length of time and ate meals standing up; severe fatigue; no stamina, etc.   My internist tried Tramadol, Gabapentin, and Lyrica which did nothing, and then put me on prednisone which was a miracle, and I could function and was pain free. He had also tested me for Lymes' Disease, Fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, West Nile, etc. etc. During this time I was also sent to a neurologist who did an Electromyography (EMG) & Nerve Conduction study (NCS) which showed no problems, and also had a CT scan of the spine which showed very mild arthritis.
So now off to a rheumatologist.  After her round of blood work and x-rays on my back and shoulders, she diagnosed me with Polymyalgia Rheumatica, with the flu shot possibly being the “trigger” that sent me into full blown Polymyalgia Rheumatica.  She had me do four prednisone infusions (250 mg. each) in two weeks; put me on 15mg of oral prednisone; methotrextate 2.5 mg three tablets together once a week; Actonel 150 mg. - once a month; and folic acid - 1 mg. daily.
After my second visit in early January she increased the methotrextate to six tablets together once a week; and stepped me down to 10 mg. of prednisone daily, and is still stepping me  down with the hope to have me on 5 mg. of prednisone every other day by my next visit on March 4th.  I'm presently (Jan.26, 2015) at 7 & 1/2 mg. of prednisone daily and struggling with additional stiffness of thighs and shoulders, and no stamina again. I've been on this the past four days and every days more symptoms coming back.  So last night I took the full 5 mgs instead of 1/2 of a tablet, making it back to 10 mg. for the day.  This morning was so much better!!! Not sure I'll make it to her hope of 5 mg. of prednisone every other day by March 4th.
Finding this site and forum has been awesome.  I've barely scratched the surface reading the posts, but have already learned so much the past two days of reading.  I know this is long, and promise shorter posts in the future.

"Hello all you wonderful people.
I've been diagnosed with PMR since last July and on prednisone ever since.  I used the gradual withdrawal method to get down to 10 mg/day and have been at that dosage for about 2 months.
But after coming back from a business trip last week, I think I'm in the midst of a significant flare-up.
Here's my question:  I'd rather NOT increase the dosage to deal with the flareup and just wait for it to simmer down on its own.  But is that possible?  Can the inflammation simmer down on its own or will I have to increase the dosage to deal with it?
Thanks all!

"I was diagnosed with PMR a year ago & have been on pred & all has gone pretty well.  Prior to this diagnoses, about a year prior, I had joint replacement on my left ring fnger & now am due to have it on my right ring finger.  Joint is swollen & very painful.  Just did bllod tests which were well within the normal range, but rheumy said that this is decidedly not PMR, which I kind of knew.  He ordered an MRI & is going to do further blood work.  Just curious what could you have in conjunction with PMR.  Could it be RA?  All of my fingers are a bit stiff & clumsy & wrting is difficult.  I would love to avoid more surgery if possible.

"I'm waiting for the results of a biopsy to ascertain if I have GCA but having read the posts on this brilliant forum, I'm now wondering if I also have PMR.
I was diagnosed by my GP with Fibromyalgia a few years back as I was suffering painful areas (shoulders, hips, neck, knees) I've been taking amitriptyline 50mg at night to help with pain and Pramipexole .88mg to stop relentless restless leg syndrome, both have helped but now I'm also waking in the mornings with terrible pain about armpit level across my back, it's painfull to turn in bed but after I've had a hot shower and moved about some it did start to lesten but is now carrying on through the day.
My Mother suffered with PMR and I wondered if it is hereditary?  I spoke about this with my GP but she said as I was already taking Pred for the suspected GCA a blood test would not be helpful.
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

"I apologise if this is just a repeat of other posts gone by, but it's really hard to search through old discussions....
I also apologise if this is just a newbie question....
The thing I don't get yet is how come people still get pain and fatigue etc if you are taking pred? If you are taking the appropriate dose then why are you still suffering? I thought the whole idea was that you take the minumum dose to control the symptoms. I understand that you might/will get flare ups but surely it's just a case of increasing the dose and not just putting up with it?
I am still adjusting my dose and had a flare up last week because I dropped it too quickly, but I get that. What I don't get is why people are suffering when it seems a simple fix to up the dose when you get a flare up.
Or have I just missed the point?

"Hi all,  this is getting old but I'd like a little advice on my next decrease.
HIstory:
Diagnosed in March 2013 - put on 20mg pred (white tabs)
- my GP had me reduce to quickly and by the time I saw my rheumy in May I was having a flare and he put me back up to 20mg
- I had joined the forum by that time and realized I needed to decrease very slowly which was also the suggestion of my rheumy (although he would have done it a little quicker)
- by the end of July 2014 I was absolutely thrilled to begin my last decrease to ""0"".
-I guess my body definitely wasn't ready for that move. I had had a very stressful week (wasn't supposed to be but ??) and I started with the stiffness and then the pain began.  I knew it was a flare and tried going to 1mg for almost 2 weeks, then 2 for a week then back to 5mg where I stayed until October.
- in Oct 2014 I decreased to 4mg using the DSAS method which I continued on successfully until January (even through travel and surgery).
-In January, after all the busy holiday time was over, I tried to decrease to 3.5mg still using the DSAS method.  I made it to the 3rd week and had my worst flare yet.  I was stiff and in pain and got pretty angry about it.
- I increased back to 4mgs - that didn't work so increased to 5mg for 4 or 5 days and that didn't work so decided to blast it with 10mg (on the advice of our wise women). 
-I have been at 10mg since Jan 29, 2015 and I'm going to begin to decrease to 9mg.  I was going to use the DSAS method but I've been reading that some people can do alternate 10mg and 9mg to see how it feels and also some do 10mg for 3 days then 9mgs then another 3 days at 10mg and see how it goes. 
-considering my history, I'm really afraid of going to quickly but would dearly love to get to 7.5mgs at least because of the side affects.  
- FYI, I have never done a decrease if I have symptoms of inflammation.  
Sorry for going on and on but I thought it might help if you knew some history.
I would so appreciate your thoughts on this.

"Dealing with pain since mid Dec.  At that time only shoulders.  Had MRIs on both shoulders and showed many partial thickness tears in rotator cuffs and surrounding tissues.  Sent to Orthopedist and got cortisone shots in both shoulders.  Worked for about 2 1/2 weeks.  Also have been on PT.  I'm a very active 68 year old man, but my PC got suspicious and thought it might be PMR.  He started me on 20mg pred and symptoms started getting relief pretty quickly.  Just had confirming lab tests.  Will be seeing a Rheumatologist at end of April.  Tried tapering to 15mg but pain started returning,  How long does it usually take before tapering can really begin?

Then today my hips and upper thighs hurt as though Ive pulled all my muscles in my upper legs and I have had to resort to paracetamol. But I did have to do loads of stuff which involved carrying and walking - yesterday for about 1.5 hours and today the same. I had no choice as I had no help - could it be that? I dont want to go back up and as I say I was fine until I did all this walking. The paracetamol are really helping but its still there waiting. Anyone experience this if they do too much?

I have been hovering around 6/7 for a few months, but I have never really got rid of the pain.  I put up with pain.  So many people have the most awful, incurable, illnesses that I feel guilty moaning about my discomfort.
The thing I want to know is:  how many of the a-typical PMR patients on this forum have similar difficulties after so long.  My blood results yo-yo, never completely in what is considered the 'normal' range.

"Once she opened the letter I told her that Rheumy had prescribed A Acid and told her I would not be taking it.  I told her I would take responsibilty for making that decision and would consider in the future after a Dexa Scan, she couldn't understand why he hadn't sent me for one.  Not to worry she couldn't make out the dosage he wrote, so she is waiting on a letter from Rheumy.  
She agreed with me that if and whem I may need A Acid then I will take it but not before Dexa and not until after the dental implants are completed.  So all in all I am pleased.  Will be reducing from 15mg pred to 12.5mg and see how I go, will be doing that Monday or Tuesday.

"Hi everyone had problems this week but first in short my history, Pmr started two years ago on 9 1/2 mgs of pred finding it hard to reduce. Five years ago I had a few chest pains nothing was wrong just slight changes in my conarie arterys was put on 75mg aspirin and atorastatin 40 mg also on 100 mg thyroxine and adcal. On Monday I had chest pains they traveled up to under my tongue they were so bad we sent for paramedics they wired me up not overly concerned at all after 40 minutes she gave me four 75mg each aspirin and in five minutes all pain had gone, because it was the heart I had to go with them to hospital for a blood test six hours after the pains started it came back no heart attack thank goodness, so my questions are does anyone think this chest pain has come with the prednisalone or possibly my arterys have got worse I'm quite breathless when doing things like going up stairs cleaning up etc, problem also I cant get to see cardiologist for at least two months my doctor has requested an angiogram when I eventually get to see him. I simply hate taking pred but like everyone here we can't live without them. Feeling sorry for myself at the moment I'm 53,working, life is getting harder and harder has anyone any clues what has happened to me. Family history in brief mum died age 39 heart attack dad died aged 64 heart attack things aren't looking good are they. Sorry to be depressive.

"Hello, I am writing this morning because I'm tired of having to fight  and I need to have people they understand  !! I saw another endocrinologist yesterday and it was a meeting to forget. He gave me a sermon on prednisone and side effects from even the death !!!! He gives even questioned the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica my family doctor did and that has at least 35 years of medical practice by referring to an internist !!! I felt for him polymyalgia it was perhaps in the head! Another endocrinologist who wants to wean myself prednisone quickly! Upon my return home endo, I went on the website where patients give their opinion on what doctor and more than half felt the exact same thing as me, or that it is imbued with itself that he does not listen to the patient etc. This morning I decided to take another appointment with my family doctor and discuss with him if he can make me look endocrine blood tests every 6 months and if problem I see an endocrinologist. I know very well what a too rapid withdrawal and I do not want another too rapid withdrawal. I started to decrease prednisone, but I do it very slowly to the beat that my body can take and especially avoid a reccurence of PMR. Thank you very much to read me !

"Something of a set back for me. As some of you know, I have been doing a gradual return to work following diagnosis of GCA just before Christmas.
Last Thursday, a couple of people in the office, including and especially my boss, came into work with colds/coughs. By the middle of the night, I knew that I was getting a sore chest. I got worse (I was at home in bed) and was admitted to hospital Sunday as my heart rate was far too high due to lack of oxygen. An xray showed a nasty infection in both lungs. The long and short of it was 3 days in hospital.
I already had an appointment with my rheumatologist today, so my husband dragged me to see him. The rheumy had been away and hadn't been aware that my GP had allowed me to go back to work, albeit on a gradual return. He was very unhappy about that, as he said he had told her that I should not return until I was on a stable dose of Pred. I am currently on 25mg, having tried to manage the tapering myself due to useless GP. I had a good discussion with rheumy about tapering by 2.5mg only over a period of time.
He has now signed me off for a minimum of a month. Of course, the lung infection needs time to clear up as well.
My husband then did what I should have done myself at the beginning of my GCA journey and called the doctors surgery and told them that I need to be under an experienced senior GP from now on as the GP I have been under has been incompetent and this is the last in a series of errors she has made which could have had serious repercussions on my health.
Tomorrow I will call the surgery to see one of the senior partners who is well regarded. I can then hopefully begin to feel I am in safe hands.
I'm feeling really rough, the infection and the double dose of antibiotics are taking their toll, but at least I feel optimistic that with the change in GP, I will be in better hands, - watch this space! :-)

"Started by feeling faint and unwell. Couldn't eat anything. All food tasted bland like cardboard. Same evening I was shivvering and feeling really ill. The headaches started the next day. Very severe. When I stood up I couldn't move until the pounding stopped. Saw my GP 3 days later and he told me to go for a blood test the next week. Nurse took blood and results came back 4 days later. I'd suffered for 2 weeks by then. GP rang and told my hubby to get in for a prescription quick and I had to take 40mg Prednisolone immediately as it was a medical emergency.
I'm 54 so I didn't think he took me seriously enough considering that I could lose me sight with this. Reduced my steroids to 30mg last week and I went for a new blood test today. Results will come next week.
Today I went to the emergency dept at local hospital due to severe chest pain that radiated round my upper back and jaw. ECG showed no heart problem so it must be the Temporal Arteritis. Read today on internet that it can cause heart attack if those arteries are affected or a stroke.
Had tender scalp with this but had it before without headaches over a few years. Still getting headaches now too so I'm hoping GP is giving me strong enough steroids.
Since starting this I'm a bit dithery and weak. Don't know if it's the steroids or the condition. It's worrying, painful and a nuisance. Hope it doesn't last too long. :roll:

"We all experience pressure in our lives. Stress is the feeling of being under excessive pressure and unable to cope. Though not an illness itself, stress can contribute to conditions, including high blood pressure and high cholesterol, that cause serious illness if allowed to go unchecked.
Excessive pressure makes us feel threatened and our body responds by producing a surge of the hormones adrenaline and cortisol – the ‘fight or flight’ response – which can trigger the production of cholesterol to provide the body with energy and repair damaged cells. Cortisol also creates insulin, which stimulates sugar production. In recurrent stressful situations, an excess of cholesterol is produced and sugars are repeatedly unused, eventually being converted into triglycerides and other fatty acids. And so excessive stress becomes a threat to heart health.
Common signs of stress include problems sleeping, loss of appetite and difficulty concentrating.
You may feel anxious, irritable and less confident. You may become more quick tempered or experience headaches, muscle tension or pain. Some people feel the urge to drink or smoke, believing it will relax them. If you’re not sure what’s causing your stress, keep a diary of stressful episodes over four weeks. This will help to identify what triggers your stress, how you operate under pressure and how to develop better coping mechanisms.
There may be little you can do to prevent the causes of stress but you can learn to handle it better. There is no single method that will work for everyone but some common techniques include:
·             Relaxation. Techniques such as yoga and tai chi can help to relieve the emotional and physical symptoms of stress by combining deep breathing with muscle relaxation.
·             Exercise. It won’t make the cause of your stress disappear but it can clear your thoughts and help you to deal with your problems more calmly.
·             Healthy living. Make sure you have a balanced, healthy diet and get enough sleep each night. Don’t rely on alcohol, smoking or caffeine to help you cope. They will leave you feeling worse in the long run.
·             Organisation. Good time management can mean re-evaluating your work-life balance. Prioritise your workload, concentrating on the tasks that will make a real difference to your work.
·             Positive thinking. Focus on the pluses in life and things for which you’re grateful.
·             Time out. Earmark some quality ‘me time’, to help you relax.
·             Emotional support. A strong network of friends and family can relax you and give you a different perspective. Doing things with friends and talking things through can help you unwind and may help you find solutions to your problems. Talking about your stress may help identify the cause and develop coping techniques.
·             Acceptance. Changing a difficult situation isn’t always possible. If this proves to be the case, accept things as they are and concentrate on things you can control.
If you’ve tried self-help techniques and they don’t appear to be working, go and see your GP. They may suggest other coping techniques or recommend counselling. If your stress is causing serious health problems, such as high blood pressure, you may need further tests or medication.

"Hi everyone
As posted previously, I had my biopsy on 24th March and was discharged without an outpatient appointment.  Today I received an appointment with a rheumatologist for the 22nd May, is it normal to wait this long for the results.  I am worried about what may be happening with regards to blood levels during this time on Pred without any checks being made and I have a reduction plan of 5mg every 7 days until I'm down to 15mgs from 30mgs.  I've read on this site that many people suffer flare ups as they try to reduce but I haven't been told what to do if that happens.  I feel like I'm out on a limb on my own, it's a bit confusing and scary.
thanks

"Hi,
I've been having back and hip pain for months and months now and after X-Rays and MRIs still have no idea what is causing it, I am due to see my GP again next week and hopefully be referred for more.
I have a very tender spot on my spine between my shoulder blades, specifically an area of bone that hurts to touch and causes a lot of pain when I lean forward or move my shoulders/shoulder blades back. It's a dull, quick pain that almost feels like a lump or something rubbing but it is always in the same spot/area. Pain killers don't seem to make any difference and it's getting worse.
My hips are also causing me a lot of pain. If I stand still and thrust/move my hips forward, I experience a sharp pain in both hip joints/groin that sometimes jolts down my bum. It stops me from stretching and being able to fully flex my legs. I can feel this whenever my hip is being pushed forward, the pain doesn't seem to occur if my hip is resting or 'sat back', I can stretch my legs very well, but if my hip is forward then the pain is extreme and almost feels like nerve twitches are stopping me extended.
The easiest way to describe an example of this pain is by standing still and moving my feet out as if I am trying to do the splits - almost as soon as I start stretching the pain in my groin and hips starts.
Another example: if I lay flat on my back (with my knees up and feet on the floor, hands down by my side and legs slightly apart) and try to lift my bum off the floor and thrust my hip upwards, the pain starts. It seems like the pain is most apparent whenever my legs are further apart but different movements/stretches are causing the exact same pain. Generally stiff and painful. But if my hips are not under pressure, then I have no pain or stress in my groin joints when walking or doing regular things.
It'smaking me feel very fatigued and anxious! 
I was tested for a gene that increases the chance of having Ankylosing Spondylitis, but this, other blood tests and all my scans came back fine according to my doctor. I'm a 24 year old, generally healthy male and I'm eager to figure out what's going on and how I can relieve the pain.
Any ideas?
Thanks, 
Chris

"Distinguising features of GCA: Joint pain in jaw, pain in temple area, tenderness across forehead above eye, tenderness of scalp and possible hair loss, ear ache, ringing in ears, neck discomfort (carotid area). Reduced or fluttering pulse in temple.
Requiring immediate specialist attention: flashing lights, double vision, blurring, colour change.
Possible physical disability due to Polymyalgia Rheumatica: aches and disability due to rstriction of movement in both shoulders and/or both hips. If arms are affected, the patient cannot lift their arms above their head.  
Possibly raised CRP (and ESR) but this is not a diagnostic test as to the level of inflammation or the danger that vessel damage could occur or contribute to, or increase the risk of having a stroke, heart attack or dementia. Low CRP and ESR might be an indication that vessel damage has already occurred and extra cautions are required.
First line treatment: Presnisolone. Problems associated with this drug - increased risk of infections, delayed wound healing, diabetes, weight gain, fluid retention, muscle wastage, increased blood pressure, irritation of the stomach, bone thinning, mood changes.
Anxiety and depression also associated with these conditions.
Not got so far as stating the blood tests which should be given but DEXA scan once a year is on his list, regular blood pressure of all 4 limbs, testing 5 pulses, diabetes monitoring. Also supplelement are suggested though not got that info either.

"Hello all,  Had a bit of a scare last evening, I have GCA/PMR since 2012
had a few blips on the way that most people have with that condition.
Had excellent help on my last flare up problem, which Eileen suggested I may be dehydrated, and being on holiday I think I was, drank lots of wAter and felt sooo much better,
Anyway, (still on hols)  had a lovely day out sightseeing no less tiring than anything I normally do , felt great all day, got back in the evening, had a cup of tea (only 3rd during the day and 1 coffee) which I normally have,
but relaxing with my tea, suddenly these palpitations started, quite sort of pounding ones, that went on for about 40 mins  quite scary. 
I am on 4 Pred a day ' take BP tablets for about 10 years (which is white coat syndrome) at home it's normal, but at the surgery it  shoots up. Also a disposable aspirin.
Slept ok and feel ok this morning. I am home next week so will chk it all out, but does anyone else get palpitations?

"I find it extraordinary that even professionals do not seem to understand the difference between Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) and Temporal Arteritis (TA) and confuse the two.
When Arteritis exclusively affects the temporal artery, it is described as Temporal Arteritis. This can cause blindness, deafness, stroke and increased risk of dementia. 
However, what is described as GIant Cell Arteritis can affect any artery in the body causing inflammation, narrowing, etc., and can cause vital organs to be starved of blood and can lead to long term and serious disability or death. 
Because the giant cells are often not found, despite the dangers of looking, the disease should really be described simply as 'ARTERITIS', that is inflammation of the arteries. 
This would avoid some of the confusion that exists around this illness which is the most common form of vasculitis, ie inflammation of the blood vessels.

"Due to GCA I was prescribed 60mg pred. last Sept. the symptoms of the infection disappeared very soon and due to horrific side-effects my rheumatologist advised I should come off the medication asap - if possible in 7 months.  I managed to get down to 25 mg and then the symptoms of GCA reapprared and I had to go back to 30 for a while.  I am now down to 12.5 mg, trying to reduce to 10mg over a period of 7 weeks but feeling very tired, confused and like a zombie most of the time.

"first visited gp dec 2010 with severe pain and stiffness in muscles of legs and hips, upper body ached but not too bad, was told had back problems and prescibed pain killers, over the next month pain and stiffness spread to every muscle in my body bar my head, thank god. returned to gp end jan 2011 and was immediately diagnosed with pmr, 20mg of predisolone given and within 12 hours pain free. in may 2011 my hands became stiff and swollen and unable to open jars etc, very painful, gp referred me to a rheumatologist as he suspected rhuematoid arthritis, appointment within 2 weeks and yes diagnosis correct,now on 15mg methotrexate which after about 8 weeks relieved pain in hands, got down to 10mg prednisolone without too much bother.
but have been unable to go maintain lower dose for any length of time, have actually got down to 1mg but within 4 days am in agony. i thought i was beating this pmr but i am afraid it is beating me at moment.
very down, weight gain awful, at least have lost moon face for the time being.
i have had lots of support from my doctors surgery and my rheumatologist.
will try again to reduce steriods but at a slower rate, have problems with pressure behind eyes and constant water infections which gp puts down to steriod side affects, in jan and feb 2012 have appointments with various hosp departments to try and sort this out.
i did feel quite alone when first diagnosed and frightened as the pain was horrific but after finding this website and reading the forum feel more confident that one day i will beat pmr, i do realise that rhuematoid arthritis is different and is incureable but seems to be controlled by the methotrexate at moment. i was 63 when diagnosed.

"had a very good appt with rheumy last Monday. I was well prepared with question/suggestions and knew better what I was talking about thanks to this forum.
he's concerned about Myopathy as I've been on 40-60mg Pred since last July - apart from 4 weeks on 30/25mg.
As I'm on 60 mgs at the moment, I'm contacting him next Monday as to how I am and he'll lower the dose if he feels it's right. My blood tests are Ok apart from CRP - 109 and ESR 38. He did say though that the blood tests aren't a definitive indicator of wellness & my symptoms have to be noticeably improved.....which they have been only for the last couple of days.
I broached the MTX  (temporarily withdrawn). I was picking up from here and from my own reading that it doesn't play a proven significant part in the treatment of GCA - his reply was that it hasn't been disproven either -mainly because there isn't a relaible body of research/trials to provide information/results.
He MAY ask me to consider trying MTX again when I reach 40mg & downwards but at a lower dose (7.5mg).
However he was taken with my suggestion of Tocilizumab and also explained about there being Botanicals we could also try. (I need to find out more about them).
We're going to move VERY slowly down, even at higher range, this time.
to address the muscle weakness I, had an assessment with an injury rehab specialist this morning and had a very short, gentle session concentrating on thigh & upper arm muscles (all have claudication).
I will be supervised over the next 3 days and assessed again as to how the session is helping  - or not!
rheumy has also asked me to see a physio for assessment to be placed in the pain class at my local clinic -(Pilates based  /individually tailored) . That's happening week after next.
onstantly) high 
re my maybe Kidney problem (CRP -107 & low GFR - 38) - Rheumy has written to my GP requesting a referral to Eurology Clinic to have Kidneys checked - he's not convinced that theMTX is responsible for the above and swollen legs & feet.
All in all I feel we got through a lot at the appt. he knew about all the research info I took with me and knew all the other rheumies involved. He worked with Pros Kirwan for many years and although he did,t know The rheumy supporting Chertsey group, he was very pleased I was going to visit the group next month.
Phew - that's enough for now. Onward & Downwards for the umpteenth time!!! 
Thank you to everyone who gave me the information & confidence to take this latest step and play a bigger part in the appt. .....and my future.

"Hello,  Would someone with experience be able to help me with  a problem that I have?
Last May I was diagonsed with Pmr/Giant cell and RA all on the same day of seeing a Rheumatologist.  I had really bad shoulder, arms neck and shoulder pain.  I was given 60mg of prednesolone and they pain was gone within two days.  The headache which felt like a ""hammer drill"" was just on one side.  I really do not know if this was Giant cell as I did not have a painful jaw or blurred vision I did have a pain on the side of my head which made wearing glasses uncomfortable.  Is this enough symptoms to justify having to have 1500mg of IV and high steriods plus 20mg of Methotrexate. 
You see the problem I am having is that all my blood readings are perfectly normal the biopsy (which was done 5 months into steriod treatment) was normal the only so called evidence is a ultrasound that showed slight inflammation on the temple and under the arm and a MR Scan on my hands that show a lot of joint erosion.  (Rheumy say RA) , could be Osteoarthritis couldn't?
I am having a real problem coming to terms that I have Giant Cell and RA, I really do think that they have it wrong and that they are covering themselves just in case it ""maybe"".
In the last three weeks I have stopped the Methotrexate and are coming down very very slowly off the steriods.  I feel fine! so could someone please advise me am I doing the right thing.  My Rheumy doesn't know that I have done this and really need to find out if they have made a mistake because their diagnosis condemns me to a life time of toxic drugs and bad side effects.  I would be really grateful for any advise you could give to me.

"All doctors can easily find out information about even rare illnesses. If a doctor fails to diagnose a serious illness, such as GCA (which is a medical emergency), and the patient's health is permanently damaged, the patient has a right to complain, to received an explanation or apology or sue for financial compensation. 
I make absolutely no apology for insisting that doctors provide adequate care to their patients and not leave them, as I was, in pain - and considerable justified anxiety - for 5 months with insufficient medication to prevent damage to blood vessels.
There is no excuse. 
I know the NHS is in financial difficulty but the Ombudsman who deals with NHS complaints has been declared 'unfir for purpose'. 
There are many oprganisations which support patients to claim their rights to responsible medical attention, such as Healthwatch, the Patients Association, Pohwer (which is a £9 charity which exists exclusively to help patients to complain about bad NHS treatment).    
The consequences of a failure to diagnose and properly treat GCA are long term very serious disability and it angers me immensely that it is being brushed under the carpet as though it is something that might only cause loss of eyesight.

"My dad has had temporal arteritis for more than 10yrs now. He has been treated with prednisolone and latterly also methotrexate too. He has never been able to reduce to less than 12mg steroid daily.
On thursday morning he had an event that occured within 2hrs of being fine whereby my mum found hin collapsed and shaking, totally unresponsive verbally though not unconcious.
He was transferred to local hospital by emergency ambulance.
There he continued to be unresponsive to all stimulus, non verbal and vague.
He was also incontinent, pyrexial and chesty.
Immediate treatment with iv fluids and paracetamol then work up of bloods and ct brain are allegedly negative.
We are awaiting an urgent MRI now but two days on he has become gradually more alert and coherent but with tremor and headache. The headache was prevalent on becoming awake as he was post ictal following the event.
His only active treatment now has been with 30mg pred now and he states that the headache and tremor and weakness begin to recur as they wear off after approx 5-6hrs.
Docs on the ward today were going to discharge him but as he has not had the promised MRI or had definitive diagnosis we declined to take him home.
The only suggested diagnosis has been possible TIA?
They havent even asked his neurology team to be involved.
Do you out there think there is
Any other diagnosis to consider?
We are right to insist he is scanned before discharge?
Should see his neurologist?
Being too precious?
Should i be doing anything else?

"My wife recently developed what is believed to be Polymyalgia Rheumatica, although this is not confirmed by ESR tests and steroid treatment failed to have any effect over a period of 7 days.
With the doctors scratching their heads we are wondering about herbal treatment; you can't stay on opiate pain killers for ever. There's a treatment called Rheumeton available from New Zealand. Any one tried it?

"Hi. I am new to the forum and would welcome any feedback from people with similar experience.
I have been taking Prednisolone for PMR for 3 years, gradually reducing the dose till I am now on 3mg. Although I have felt fine all the time I have been taking the tablets and have had no flare-ups, the CRP readings when I have a blood test nearly always show some level of inflammation. This has happened whether I've been taking 10mg or 5mg or the current 3 mg.The last CRP reading 2 weeks ago was 24 (I don't know if that's high or medium!) and a letter from my rheumatologist suggests that I may need to increase the steroids when I see him for my next appointment. Does anyone know whether it matters too much that there is still inflammation in my system? I am not aware of it, I am active and have very little sign of any aches and pains so I wonder if it would be reasonable to try to come off the steroids and see whether the inflammation stays the same, or would it be better to raise the dose of steroids yet again, which I would do if inflammation might be dangerous. I will see what the rheumatologist says before changing anything, but I would be interested to know what other people think.

"When I started this trip on the PMR trudge in November 15.After a few weeks when the pain had subsided I felt reasonably good .i started at 15 mg and now down to 11.5 .Occasionally I get the variouse withdrawal ache and pains when dropping pred at half  mg every 2to 3 weeks ,but I am surprised that I feel so drained .I thought after the initial withdrawal that I would feel reasonably back to normal until the next half mg drop .But to day by day I feel as though I am walking through slow drying cement .Does there come a level when I will get some energy going again as I think I did upto a couple of month at the beginning of all this .I sorry to bother ,who I feel are now my friend but feel so tired today and weepy ,hopefully will feel better tomorrow..Due to see Docter 4to 5 weeks for next blood test result but wonder if it's all par.for the course or should I check it out.

"Finally had my heart surgery on Monday morning. All went well thank goodness and am now home on the road to recovery with not too much pain. I was on 12 mg prednisolone as I had a flare at Christmas and had to up the dose from 9 mg (PMR/GCA Feb 14). I took my pills in with me, including Digoxin but had difficulty with many of the drugs I was given. It was a very busy hospital with ever changing staff and drugs always arrived at 10 am, all in one pot, no food, no Digoxin and only 10 mg prednisolone! More stress came from that issue than anything else! Anyway, I tried to discuss my drug concerns with many nurses and the pharmacist but none would help. This is my prescribed list = Aspirin od, Furosemide od, Lansaprazole od (all night stomach cramp),Ramipril  (avoided so far)paracetamol and codeine 30g to 60 mg as well as pred and Digoxin.

"for those of you who didn't read my previous post re. Pred and stomach ulcers, I will briefly recap. My GP thought I had PMR so put me on Pred 15mg for a week and I was back to 75%nomal but had dreadful heartburn despite taking 40mg oh Omeprazole which I have for the past 10 years as I have had two previous perforated stomach ulcers due to Zollinger Ellison Syndrome. GP wouldn't continue with Pred and referred me to a Rheumatologist. On the first appointment he did lots of blood tests and gave me an injection in my bum which was miraculous. Saw him last week and definitely PMR in his opinion. He told me he would repeat injection four weeks from the first one. 12 days on from the first injection I have pain returning but more worryingly have pain in my stomach and vomiting something which resembles coffee grouts. I know this all too well from previous ulcers. Spoke to my gastroenterologist who told me to up Omeprazole to the maximum dose and NEVER to take Prednisolone or any form of steroids however they are administered, unless I have a death wish. How the hell (excuse the language) function without any medication any thoughts please please please

Ihave no signs of gca -head pain -blurred vision etc .do you think i could just ride out the strains without going up on pred only although before looking after  hubby i was not pain free but i did not have brain fog and not as much fatigue .am i explaining it properly !!!i hope so  -help!

"hello, I have GCA/PMR since November 2012 and have been reasonably well ptrtty much after the first month on 60mg, and slowly reducing after blood tests (although I know they aren't terribly reliable). I ami presently down to 4 Pred a  day which I have been doing on Eileen's slow reduction advice,, been on 4 for the past 5 weeks, and felt fine, walking, swimming, perhaps more wine than I have at home, (holiday) but not more than 1 or 2 glasses a
day.  Perhaps the headaches could be sinus, also get like a neuralgia ache in jaw, 
but I have had such a bad day today?  I am on holiday, and perhaps being away, I may have panicked a bit, but not normally like that.
I woke with really bad headache which was sort of all over head and behind eyes, wobbly legs,  tried to ride it out, went for walk, which was ok but once back headache, aches & pains mostly headache came back. Went to bed for the afternoon, slept on and off, legs like jelly when I got up, thought I would pass out if I stood up, really frightening.
drank a lot of water, feeling bit better,  but never had a day like that before. Perhaps because away from home it's more worryuing.  Question is Shall I up my pred?

"My symptoms started after Christmas in 2010 and I steadily went downhill over a period of 5 days until I could no longer get out of bed by myself, nor get off the toilet or a chair. I cried in my husband’s arms the night that he had to use a gait belt to help me stand from the bed and even then it took me a couple of minutes to start walking. I was eventually sent to the E.R. where they ruled out Guion Beret and a pulmonary embolism (clot) in the lungs. My CRP was 58, but my sed rate has not been elevated.
The E.R. sent me back to my PCP who decided to try a high dose of steroids. She put me on 60 mg/day for 5 days only, her theory being that she wanted to zap whatever virus was causing my inflammation (too bad my problem eventually turned out to be PMR). My husband says that I nearly bounced off the bed after the first dose. By day 2, I was walking without any help and feeling well! This lasted the 5 days, but on day 6, with no steroid, I crashed. My daughter had to convince the weekend on-call physician to let me have some steroids until Monday.
My PCP kept me on 40 mg for 2 weeks until I saw a rheumy. I am fortunate to have a good rheumy who treats me symptomatically, rather than relying just on blood tests. I have a great PA in the office that I see regularly and the rheumy usually sticks his head in at the end of my visit to just touch base with me.
I had a lot of fatigue initially, but that seems to have decreased or I have learned to adapt. Speaking of adapting, I cannot do without my high toilet seat, shower chair, and 2 canes that keep my gait straight. I have the terrible moon face, buffalo hump, cold sensitivity in my mouth, and some tearyness from the steroids. I cannot stand for more than a few minutes, have advanced OA in my right knee, pain in the left hip and right lower leg (both probably due to my FM!). Even with all of this, I have good days, many more lately.
I was started on Lyrica for the FM pain about 10 days ago and that seems to be helping. I was able to stop taking the Tramadol at night. I use ½ tab a couple times a week if I need to take the edge off the pain. I am finally down to 18 ½ mg of Prednisone, having had a flare-up recently and a temporary dose increase.
I am a 64 year old female, live in Colorado, USA and am very active with my hobbies/interests (which I already put in another post).
I am already enjoying the many posts on this site and feel welcomed.

"Hello everyone,
I have always had shoulder/neck discomfort for most of my life. I put it down to tension and poor posture. Last summer it got much worse and then a couple of months later appeared in my groin/pelvis too. Dr diagnosed PMR.
I successfully dropped from 15 to 7mg pred, but shoulder aches reappeared, I've persevered and now down to 5.5mg, shoulders getting bit worse, REALLY tired, but no pain in groin as yet.
I know this is something I should be asking my Dr, and I am about to get an appt, but jst thought I would run it past you all. 
Would you try upping the pred or carry on a bit longer to see how it goes? I'm not in excruciating pain, just strong discomfort.
Thank you all so much for listening. Pam.

"as some of you know I was diagnosed a few months ago with PMR. Can't take Pred because of previous stomach ulcers which had perforated. Had an injection from my Rhematologist depo me drone which was magic, another two weeks ago and a third today. He suggests rather than cutting the dose down ,, 120 mg I space then out further apart to gradually reduce the dose, I feel brilliant on them and no side effects. He worked out that over two weeks I am currently having about 9 mg a day.  He is going to teach my partner how to administer them so I haven't got to go to hospital every time for them if we are away and they run out. It's administer as needed but this last one lasted 4 days longer than the previous one. So far so good

"Hi everyone!
I got diagnosed in October last year (2014) at age 51 (and they say this is an 'older person's' disease!) Since then I've taken a really good look at my lifestyle and really, it's no wonder I got sick.
I've battled with my weight most of my life and I had a period where I really did drink too much (not any more). I even went to the drastic measure of getting a lap band in 2008 which, of course, only helped in the short term as I really didn't change my eating habits.
So, since the beginning of this year I've committed to change. I've been doing a LOT of reading/research into processed food and the amount of sugar that has been introduced into modern diets, which not surprisingly correlates with the extreme rise in obestity since the 1970s (think High fructose corn syrup hitting the US market in 1973). The literature indicates that there is a direct link between sugar intake and inflammation (as well as a lot of the other metabolic syndrome conditions, diabetes, heart disease, obestity, high blood pressure etc)
As a result I've cut out ALL crap - no processed food, no sugar, no 'pretend' fats and oils and managed to lose 5kg whilst on pred!
WOO HOO (currently on 10mg daily but symptoms are flaring again with the latest 2.5mg reduction)
Is anyone else eating 'clean'?
Have you noticed a difference in your health, particularly in regard to your PMR?

i have had all the bloods done Eileen asked about, and the doctor said all ok, and i have made an appoinment to have them done again in two weeks and will see after that. to discuss how i fee.
2. i have chronic utrica thats what all the problems with the swelling around my eyes and the itiching and the rash, she has given me something for it, so we can on;ly wait and see how that goes, but i feel better.
3. There is a 12 month waiting list for chapell allerton and she agreed it is the best hospital to go, so in the meantime she is going to moniter me and keep all the tests upto date.
4. I think my hubby was amazed at the doctor who said i really feel for you Margaret  this is a terrible illness, and no you are not panicking for nothing
a little understanding goes a long way. 
On our way home he said to me so now you know not to panic!!!!!, 
i do think he thinks his nose is out of joint, but time will tell i told him no more shouting at me and try and understand if i am restless or cannot sleep its my body doing all this to me.
she agrees about the reduction and has given me 1mg, white tablets, she also said reducing by 2.5 is not acceptable.
At last a doctor who understands.
thank you all for your support, and no matter what hubby says i will still keep on this forum for i am learning more and more.
Going hopefully to leeds to get the book on self help.
Hope you all have a good painfree day.

But the shaking and tiredness has come on since taking the the pred.I feel confidence slipping away .

I can move with some discomfort once I am out of bed and I can sit without much pain.
I called my doctor and she prescribed a muscle relaxing medication which made me sleep, but getting out of bed was still VERY painful.
It could be the height of the bed and the softness of the mattress which makes getting up and out of it very difficult.
I am on 15 mg of prednisone which does not take care of the pain.  I tried Aleve which helped some.
Eileen, please can you give me some advise and counsel?  Thank you!

"Hi
I have been down at 10mg since the end of January and have not felt as good. I saw the registrar at the hospital today and he agreed I should go up to 12.5 mg for a month and the reduce to 11.5mg, then 1mg a month.
He said if I have problems reducing again then try methotrexate. He was horrified by the Bristol protocol and the idea of 10mg for a year. He said that could cause necrosis of the femur.
My bloods were within normal range now. 26.7 before I started then down to 13 when I was in diclofenac three times a day ( with the side effects of tummy pain and diahorrea) then 0.6 when I started at 15mg of pred, up to 0.7 on 12.5mg and 2.1 on 10mg. I had no pain after a week on 15 and then in 12.5, but since I have been on 10mg I am having hip pain, difficulty walking up stairs, getting dressed and sleeping. Reg did not think my CRP moving from 0.7 to 2.1 was significant!
I am resting as much as poss and only working part time.
Any ideas?

"Hi all,
I've been diagnosed with PMR and have been on prednisone since July of 2014.  I'm currently on 10 MG/day.  A few days ago, I was clobbered by the flu.  Fever, cough, aches all over, chills and painful to move my eyes.
The fever has finally lifted, but I still have substantial achy feelings when I move my eyes.  I also have pain in my left temple.
Given that I have had the flu, I am assuming that the discomfort is flu related -- even the discomfort in the temples.
But reading about GCA scares me.  What do you think?  Should I continue assuming that the symptoms are flu-related or should I go into action and start taking the high doses of prednisone ""just in case?""
Just looking for some advice.

"So very glad Elizabeth got the proper medical cared from what I have read on the internet along my journey since last September 2014 GCA can be very dangerous if not treated quickly.  It started with pains in my right shoulder which then spread to my other shoulder and lower back buttocks and eventually the backs of my legs.  By mid October my husband was dressing me to go to work.  I went back to the doctor who thought I had Fibromyalgia and gave amytriplene. By the end of November I was in such bad pain I went back and doctor ordered blood work.  CRP levels were 60 and he diagnosed PMR put me on 20mg of prednisone and referred me to a Rheumatologist.  The prednisone made me feel better right away.  The prednisone was reduced by 2.5mg every two weeks until 10Mg and then 1mg per month.  Since I have been of 9mg a month I have had terrible pain and stiffness in the tops of my hands and feet which made it impossible to work.  I have now been off for a week.  The ultrsound of my hands showed there is no RA which I am thankful for.  Alot of pain has now also come back in my  lower back hips and buttocks and upper arms.  The Rheumatologist advised that my CRP levels are normal and did the trigger point test.  Advised that pain in the hands and feet are not a symptom of PMR.  He advised I may have Fibromyalgia and referred me back to my family doctor.  My family doctor does not think I have Fibromyalgia and the Rheumatologist didnt put it in his note so I am now not getting paid to be off.    I am very frustrated with no diagnosis and next appointment is in 2 months.  I have been following your posts since this started and wondered if anyone has some suggestions on what to do next.

Unfortunately I got got upset and was in tears with the receptionist who was very pleasant, she then said that she could get a doctor to ring me back today and see what they think. I just want my query regarding PMR to be taken seriously and not just brushed off as the doctor I saw this afternoon did. I don't want PMR, but if I do have it I want to try to lessen the horrible pain that I'm suffering with. If it's just that my fibromyalgia is getting worse theni will just have to live with it.

"      I kept  thinking about a recent discussion of frequent heart rhythm problems on these pages  among PMR patients.  I have had plenty of heart rhythm problems myself- too slow (35bpm) for a long time, cured by a cardiac ablation, and then too fast (250bpm), cured by a big electric shock.  I kept wondering if these electrical heart problems were related to my muscle cramping.  The common factor is electricity, or to put it more precisely, faltering electrical systems.  
       So I looked up ""inflammation and electronics"", and was I surprised.    I read an article in the NY Times ""can the nervous system be hacked?"" written only last year.  So read the article, it is really exciting stuff. Just  google ""hacking the nervous system"" and you will find it. They have put Rheumatoid Arthritis into remission with a nerve stimulator on the vagus nerve in the neck, no drugs at all.

"I have had fibromyalgia for over 12 years and have over the years felt that my condition has worsened not improved as I had hoped. For the last few months I have been in increasing pain and feeling rediculously tired . The fibro obviously causes both of these symproms but I can't cope with the severity I am suffering now. I could sleep 22 hours out of 24, I have no appetite at all and when I do eat a little I feel bloated and full. Do you think I could have polymyalgia rhumatica along with the fibromyalgia? I also have an underactive thyroid which isn't well controlled and also type 2 diabetes. Any advice would be welcome. Thanks D

I know i panic and feel stupid, but i am still learning from you all, i suspect so is my doctor.
it is a beautifull morning here in seahouses, yesterday i did more than i should have walking, did not want to spoil my hubbys holiday, but today i will tell him what i can do and what i cant. 
His reaction when i told him i thought i had done too much was we are not going to go on any more holidays. of course that did not help me, but i think it is hard for him to understand that one day i seem ok and the next all hell is let loose.
Hope you all have a lovely day take care,

still trying 7.5 pred.
trying nettle tea for the itching as i wondered if i might have an allery as my eyelids are puffed up in the corner and i know this can be a sign, as i had a very made case of hives 8 years ago. My whole body swelled up in big blisters, could not eat for 2 weeks and was on amino acids.
It worked.

"Have been on 12.5mgms for about 2 months reducing down slowly but I keep getting pain in thighs  hips and shoulders. (difficulty sitting and standing and getting in and out of car), I have increased the dose up to 15 mgms for a couple of days (reluctantly I might add) pain settles for a few days then comes back. Wanting to know what constitutes a flare? How long do flares last? Should I start back on 15mgms and do the Eileen reduction? I am just a bit confused as I am not sure why I am not settling. I don't get as tired as I used to. Get about 3-4 hours in the morning when I can do things like washing, cooking (if I feel like it) then become a couch potato for the rest of the day.I haven't been sleeping during the day like I used to.I have developed quite severe sciatica since my last post and am taking Lyrica and Tramadol for this. The sciatica is heaps better but not entirely gone. Still have insomnia also thinking about splitting pred dose to see if this helps. Would like some advice on times to take split doses.My GP lets me do whatever I want with the pred. My last ESR was 34 and CRP was 8. it has been reducing down from 26 since first diagnosed 2 years ago. Thank you for caring and sharing. Look forward to your responses.

"About a month or so ago both of my shoulders started to mysteriously flare up, though in different ways, and the problems don't seem to be in any hurry to go away.
Many years ago I think I threw my shoulder out from constant ball throwing day in and day out through winter and summer for my 5 - 6 dogs, to a point where I eventually could barely throw at all and took to hitting the tennis ball for them with a golf club - I thought at the time that I'd developed a torn rotator cuff, but never really did anything about it. Over the years it hasn't bothered me over much unless I do a fair bit of throwing again.
Well here I am at age 55 and suddenly the left shoulder has really become exruciatingly painful when I lift my arm up or out under stress. Examples? The other day I was dropping off a book for my daughter at the library and simply stopped at the collection box to put the volume through the slot. The combination of the weight of the book and the tension of stretching out with the arm set off the pain. Same happened again a couple of days again when someone threw a frisbee at me and without even thinking I lunged up to grab it, only to double up as this awful searing pain shot through my shoulder, like someone had just stuck a poker in it. Even today, while dropping off my wife at the airport, when I reached out through the car window to grab the parking ticket at the boom gate entry I couldn't manage it - my son had to reach over from the window behind me.   It doesn't seem to be muscular, because normally if you've pulled or hurt a muscle the pain eases off the instant you release whatever tension or pressure is inducing the pain. With this it doesn't matter if I put my arm straight back down - the pain just screams out at me for 15 - 20 seconds before it slowly subsides. My right shoulder has also developed issues, though in a more minor and different way. The pain seems to get triggered if I move the elbow about in certain directions while down or lift the shoulder as if shrugging. So the question is, am I suffering from something like bursitis, is it a rotator cuff issue, or altogether something else? Thanks in advance.

Was sent to Endocrinology by another dr at the practice and that was 8th January, they referred me to Rheumotology at Musgrave part hospital.  They in turn referred me back to RVH hospital to see the same Rheumy.  There is a 6 month waiting list for urgent appointments.  So diagnosed in November past with PMR and have yet to see a Rheumy.  Not to worry I will keep on reducing  the preds myself every 6 weeks.  Maybe it's a good thing - time will tell.  Any comments welcome and thank you all for keeping me right.

"Hi, I've written here before and got good advice which I haven't followed very well, mainly because my dr has a heart attack if I come in and havn't gone down on the prednisone.  Anyway, lately I am in so much pain I can hardly stand it.  Though I have fibromyalgia, arthritis, depression, the pain feel like the PMR kind of pain - my shoulders, arms and legs on fire with inflammation.  I had pneumonia in January and my SED rate went up to 46.  After the pnu. was gone it went down to 36.  Is that low enought that I shouldn't be feeling so much pain?  I think I'll go have a new blood test tomorrow to see if it is high and that's why I'm so miserable.  I am taking 12mg and have for a long time.  I can't bear it!

"I have had PMR for 1-1/2 years and was down to 9 mg of predisone and my rheumatoligist wants me lower and lower but I won't go as quickly as he would like. I don't think I'm a popular patient. In February I came down with bronchitis and my GP put me on an antibotic and had me take 40 mg or pred for 1 week, 20 mg for 1 week and then 10. Bronchitis is gone but pleurisy has arrived. My goodness that is painful. My GP has put me on 750 mg of Levoflaxiacin (Levaquin) and 20 mg of Pred. Warning on pharmacy paperwork says the two together may rarely casue tendon damage. Should I be very concerned? Also how do I reduce the Pred now? My body must feel like a yoyo with all the up and downs of Pred dose. Hope someone knows about this drug.

"Happy New Year to everyone
I have been back from Lanzarote since Sunday but havent felt like posting as I came back from a very good holiday with a Suntan , a sore throat and a bad cough !!
The plane going out sounded like a Doctors waiting room in January I have never heard so many people coughing !! and 3 children behind us sounded as though they had whooping cough !! So I was prepared but luckily the throat didnt start till Friday I am a bit paranoic ( I admit ) about catching bugs as I dont want anything to upset my reduction programme This week I have therefore cancelled all outings and rested a lot and the only extra aches have been where I have been coughing a lot A couple of friends I should have seen turned out to have spent Xmas ill so I was lucky
As January was such a bad month for me last year I thought here we go again back to 15mg !!! but so far so good and should be completely on 3.5 within 2 weeks on my own individual reduction plan ( My husbands eyes were glazing over when I explained it to him !! Or perhaps it was all the extra alchohol on holiday !! )
Ive another week to go before my blood test so hopefully all germs will have gone by then
Its taken ages to catch up on all of the posts (when you have a woolly head ) but hope to be joining in again now
Best wishes to all for a pain free New Year

"today was one of those days where you wake up and you know it's just going to go on forever. Woke up shaking and it wouldn't stop. Snow made the drive to my daughter's school absolutely horrible, then I had to drive one of my cats to the vet because he apparently believed he was a kitten and not an 11 year old and sprained/pulled a tendon. All of this on a day when I was clearly having a very shaking body day-had to use a cane. Given the schedule, I had to delay my pills in order to drive, which my head did not like (no driving on gabapentin).
Then zoom downtown to the Rheumatologist for my visit. my health has improved since the last visit, but then again, it pretty much had to. The doctor encouraged me to speed up my tapering of prednisone (jumping 10 mg at a time instead of the 5 mg i'm doing currently), but I said I was happy going very slowly, thank you. She reiterated that she'd work with me on my schedule but I could jump if I want to. *sigh* I think she wants me to jump 10 mg lol.

"A little bit of history... I was diagnosed with PMR 2 years ago. I slowly dropped down pred to 5 mg ( split 2 1/2 ea am and pm). I am also on Methatraxate 5 tabs 2 1/2 mg once weekly with 2mg of folic acid. I tried x 2 to drop by 1/2 mg but only up to go back to 5. I feel like my symptoms are worse since I did that. I have always dropped by 1/2 mg, can't tolerate any more than that. I'm not sure if I should try increasing dosage as I am far from pain free. Now these heart palpitations have me concerned and will see Dr shortly but ask your opinions out there.nis this common? I'm from the US...is this new medication available here? Really don't think anything changed since using Methatrexate but Rheumi wants me to continue. Any opinions or suggestions greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

"After suffering with rotator cuff injury for last 5yrs,  De Quervains in left thumb(cortisone injection) lots of Physio, I decided to join gym beg. of August. Had a great induction session which triggered hamstring strains. This got steadily worse and my Physio said something else was going on in my body. Saw GP 3rdNov14 for blood tests - was diagnosed with PMR 17thNov14, put on 15mg for 4 weeks. Saw GP 15thDec who suggested I then reduce to 12.5 for 3wks then 10mg for 6 wks.
I had withdrawal pain for 5/6 days then all ok at 12.5.
Started reducing to 10 on 6thJan (10, 12.5, 10, 10, 12.5, 10, 10, 10, 12.5, then 10 for rest of month. Withdrawal pain did not settle so I went back to 12.5mg on 3rdFeb. Still struggling with shoulder, inner thigh and back of knee pain intermittently.
I feel that I need to knock the inflammation down so I took 15mg this morning, but I'm not sure of my next steps - do I try 15 for a few days then back to 12.5? Or do I alternate for a few days?

"hello, this is my first time so please be patient. I'm worried to death about my hubby. He has just been diagnosed in January with PMR. On pred 15 mg at first, and he was greatly improved. But after three weeks they reduced the dose to 12.5 then another three weeks down to 10mg. He's now as bad as ever!! Can't sleep at night because of shoulder pain. Tried topical ointments but nothing seems to help. He is 57 and in full time work, but this is causing him problems when trying to do his job. Should he still be in pain like this? Is it normal and something he just has to put up with? The doc told him to take paracetamol if still in pain. Any help would be gratefully received. Thankyou

Steroids thin the skin, I know that.  Also mentioned about a terrible ache in both calves  muscles when I put trainers on and try to walk a couple of yards.  She asked was the ache in both calfes and I said yes, her reply was then it's not achilles.  She is going to chase the rheumotologist up as I haven't seen one yet.  It was endocrinology who made the referral to a Rheumatalogist so gp is going to chase it up.  I feel I am going it alone, other than this website, I would be totally lost.  My gp is good she was off when I was going for pain relief and was still undiagnosed and then diagnosed by a locum dr. in the practice.  I am at the end of my tether, I cannot even go for a walk, I know it will pass but it's in the meantime that's grating on my nerves.  Thanks in advance folks.

"Sorry to keep posting on here but as others have said before, it's s great to be able to talk to others in the same predicament.
Reading the postings this thing both scares and depresses me. You may remember I am unable to tolerate Pred becaus of Zollinger Ellison Syndrome.    I saw my GP yesterday who suggested I ask the rheumatologist about taking Cortsone Sparing drugs as a replacement. Does anyone have any first hand experience of these? I know you mentioned something before Eileen.
Funnily enough I now have a urinary infection too (the reason for going to the GP). Also a huge cold sore. I guess this is to do with the immune system.
as some of you may know I am due to get married on 18th April. I was so down earlier in the week I seriously contemplated cancelling it. My poor fiancé has become a semi carer overnight and gone is the lady who loved entertaining, world wide travelling, dancing the tango, walking and partying. I really feel given the fact that he is 7 years younger than me, he should be given the chance to be with someone who can do all these things. He says he's fine with it but I suspect he doesn't realise that it's not something that will right itself in a few months. I think he really can't understand why I go to bed in the datpytime for rests then go to bed in the evening so early, wake up in the middle of the night and wander around the house trying to alleviate the pain.  I've tried not to mention the P word but it takes over your life.
Sorry for the rant.

"Hi everyone well i saw my GP yesterday for blood results and review. He said i have no inflamation maybe some iron deficiency. I suggested PMR and he said as i was now taking 15mg of pred any pmr pain would have gone and my pains had not ( my arthritis). He has reduced my pred from 15mg to 5mg from today, as i have only been on that level for 2 weeks.
My pain which is sometimes unearable at best very painful, my areas are knees, thighs  back, neck, ribs and between my shoulder blades. perhaps i was hoping that my pain was pmr so i could take pred and get some relief. now it looks like the dreaded fibromyalgia or arthritis is to blame, for which there is no cure for either. so really fedup with this continuous pain i thought i had found a solution.
NB. I also suggested could i have adrenal fatigue, as my symptoms seem to match up, he is looking into that. why do we have to do all the investigating surely thats their job. sorry to go on.

"I saw my rheumy consultant on Thursday. He has decided to cut my Pred dose by 5mg weekly from 40mg, so 35 this week, 30 the next week etc, until I get to 20mg. Obviously, it will depend on my ESR and GRP, currently stable at 27 and 7.5.
I'm concerned that the drop is too quick, but suppose at this level, they want it down quickly.
Also been put on Alandronic Acid as of this Saturday.
Signed off for another 3 weeks. Maybe when I get down towards 20, I'll feel able to cope with part time work.
When I was monitored for PMR, my then consultant always cut down much more carefully, like 2.5 over a month.
What do you think of the quick reduction?

At present I am waiting for a diagnosis of some description, had my bloods done today but they only tested immunology, rheumatoid factor and fbc.
Symptoms are severe pain in both shoulders, neck, arms and lower back with aches in both legs and hands and also stiffness. No swelling at all. Doctor said it could be spread of osteoarthritis but she didn't think it was and suggested PMR which I googled and all my symptoms fit except my age as I have just turned 46. Am in so much pain I could cry and just want a diagnosis and some pain relief. Pushing a buggy is agony, even walking wears me out and makes me ache so much I don't think anyone understands unless they are in constant pain
Thanks for reading.

"I started noting signs of PMR about a year ago.  In July I was finally put on pred - 10mg and uped to 20 in September.  Recently I have been brought back down to 10mg and the pains have gone way up.  Over this past year I have, from the frustrations with getting to the problem as well as the effects and side effects of PMR I am becoming depressed, crying at unusual times and many other signs that I know are a part of it.  Additionally I am getting angrier and angrier, suprising myself at the mental road rage I feel or anger in business and personal situations I never felt before.  What I would like to know is what others are doing with these feelings.  I am beginning to understand that there isn't much one can do about PMR but wait, but the physical problems and the inability to work at my profession are hurting me and those around me that I love.  Would appreciate any insight or positive help I can look to.
Thanks

"I finally had my Rheumatologist appointment today and he does not feel I have PMR- Even though I have had a reduction in pain on prednisone, my SED is still 79 and my pain is inching back up, which in combination with other health factors and familial history, he feels is more indicitive of RA, or Chrones. He is tapering me QUICKLY to enduce a flare so that he can examine me when I am in pain. I am not looking forward to this. The prospect of Chrone's is upsetting as well, as my aunt passed away 8 years ago from Chrone's related complications. He also kept saying Lupis, which is what I have felt all along, but then kept going back to RA or Chrones. I just don't know what to think.

"Hi all~   I had a terrible weekend.  I'm not sure if its considered a flare up.  All I know is I have been reducing my medrol.  I was at 8mg.  Then 7mg for 3 weeks, then down to 6mg, for 3 weeks.  Then it hit me like a ton of bricks!
  I could hardly move, every joint hurt sooo bad.  Even my toes and fingers, which has never hurt before.  I have to say I ate bad, a few days before this...hamburgers ice cream, etc.  So I called my rheumy, who told me to go back to 8mg, 4mg in am and 4 mg in pm.   I also took a couple of pain pills over the weekend.  I slept alot, but feel 70% better today.
  Eileen , you are so right about pacing yourself, I had family visit me for a week, ( I live in florida, and visitors want to come all the time)  But it just stresses me out, and takes so much out of me, showing people around, etc.
I have learned from all of you, that I must take breaks, not to carry heavy bags, and know that this medrol needs to be taken at my comfort level.
  My questions are, why did it take till 6mg to come back with a vengence, or was it a combination of visitors, stress, and lowering all at once.
also , I will be going to new dortors in a few weeks/ change of insurence.  Why didn't prednsone work for me?? this medrol I heard is 20% stronger than pred.  They had me at 10mg of pred, reducing 1mg for 2 months, and it never seemed to help me.  I guess I am wondering if I was at a higher dose of pred.  that I would be ok instead of medrol??
  This weekend has taught me, this pmr, is not going away soon.  I have to wrap my head around it, that its here to stay for longer than I thought.  I have been diagnosed oct/2014.  so it hasn't even been 6 months yet.  But I know I had it for at least a year or two before that.  I never had problems before I moved to florida, 4 years ago.  I am originally from Chicago, il.
  do you think the weather here in fla. with all its humidity has something to do with pmr? 
 also would physical therapy help with my dwindling muscles?
Eileen , you say a low carb diet has helped you lose weight.  Can I ask you what you avoid eating, and waht a typical meal is?
  thank you all for listening, I don't know where I would be with out all your advise~ sincerley, Marie

"I have been on prednasone since July, 2014.  My dosage since september has been 20mg.  The pains are basically gone but the side effects that I have will not let me work as a tennis official.  The sides are no energy, no taste, poor sense of smell and, of course, a feeling that I have just had a giant meal without eating anything.  Over the last 2 months my eyesight has gotten blurry and I have had double vision.  Not all the time but off and on abut 40% of the time.  Last month we gradually cut down the steroid to 10mg.  Eyesight is slightly better but the lack of energy, sleepiness, and the other sides have remained the same.  Does anyone else have these side effects and how do you treat them?  Any help would be appreciated.

I have researched garlic and it doesn't seem to state any place that garlic would help an inflammatory condition. We have a new Mediterranean restaurant here and they serve a plate of garlic. I go at least once a week and have that plate garlic, so I think I'm craving garlic and eat it. Something in my body must be missing that garlic is replacing. Any thoughts? Thanks Barbara

As the day goes on, the pins and needles in the hand remain and sometimes part of the hand 'locks'. I am on 5mg of Pred a day. He wondered if this be contributing, but gave me naproxin (also take omeprazole), thinking it is more likely to be the tendons inflamed. So far there is no change.

"I have GCA and I am at 11mg for the third time. Before my last visit with my Rhumatoligist I suffered from a sever cold! My CRP level was 13 and I was advised to stay at 11mg because any infection or high stress could cause an increase in CRP. In addition, before the my last CRP only an hour had passed before the test and thus my question, ""Will taking pred 3 hrs. before a blood test lower CRP blood level?"". Here are the facts:
Prednisone is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is then converted to its active metabolite prednisolone, by hydrogenation of the ketone group at position 11, in the liver. The preconversion biological half-life of prednisone is about 60 minutes.
Prednisolone is excreted in the urine as free and conjugated metabolites together with an appreciable proportion of unchanged prednisolone. Prednisolone has a usual plasma half-life of 2 to 4 hours.""

"Diagnosed 6 months ago started on 15mg Prednisolone now down to 9mg and reducing 1mg monthly. A bit of early morning leg stiffness but no big deal. My maiin concern is that I am a T1 diabetic and the prednisolone means I have had to increase my insulin intake drastically and my blood sugar levels are often high and not consistent - I can cope but it's not easy. Does anyone have any advice. The next concern is weight  gain, initially I lost almost 2 stone. Most of that weight has gone back on but where will it end? Will I continue to gain weight on the prednisolone? I have been trying hard to cut carbs and diet but it has had very little effect. Any insights?

"After having a  flare up, I've increased my Predisone from 7 mg to 9mg.   The PMR symptoms are mostly okay now.  Can manage during the day with some irritations.   However, I'm now having other symptoms.  I get a headache within two hours after taking medication in the morning.   I'm also slightly dizzy and my lips tingle.     This never happened before, even when I was on the original dose (almost two years ago) of 20 mg.   Also, my PMR symptoms don't change once I take the Predinsone.  They are the same from the moment I get out of bed and onward for the rest of the day.     My blood pressure may be increasing?   In Dec when I saw the rheumy it was 138/88.   That was an increase from previous tests.    Anyway, what suggestions?   What might I do reduce the reaction?  Any help appreciated.   I'm now keeping a diary to watch exactly what happens each day.   Also, reduced Predinsone to 8.5 this morning.

"I have been on prednisone since May 2015 and recently reduced to 10 mg/day and attempted 9 mg/day but have been suffering from some flare ups and the return of significant muscle aches and pains in the upper arms and shoulders/neck that we are all too familiar with. Once again raising arms above shoulders and getting dressed is difficult at times particularly in the am.   In addition to these muscle pains over the last month or so I have developed a very tender right elbow where it is very painful to lift anything heavy and to even hold anything tightly in my right arm.  I am suspecting that it might be tendonitis from the prednisone and wonder if others agree or if others have suffered from these type of pains.  In contrast to the normal muscle aches and pains which i know are related to the PMR,  the elbow pain is sharper and more acute.  Seeing my rheumatologist next week so want to discuss with her along with some recurrent stomach pains (another issue) which I also suspect may be due to prednisone.  I appreciate as always the great feedback from this forum.

"I read a comment on the forum yesterday or today- and I can't find it at the moment- that qigong helped.  So I looked it up on youtube and found qigong.  It looks like there were lots of good videos, but the one I watched was the ""8 simple movements of qigong for beginngers"", a 10 minute video, by jake mace. 
       My lower back had been bothering me for a few days, and his 2nd exercise stopped the pain, even though my version of his exercise was rather pathetic- he bent his knees 90 degrees; I managed maybe 45 degrees!. 
      Later the pain came back, I did that exercise again, ""immortal twists the body"" and the pain again vanished.  There is a lot of stuff for tightness and the shoulders, so I attempted those too and generally felt better in a short time. 
     So I plan to add qigong to my daily routine and my thanks to whoever it was that said it helped.

"This subject became part of a discussion I had on shingles but I thought, since this is a different topic, I would start a new discussion.
A brief history:  I have been on pred for over 2 years, I was down to 4mg and started the DSAS method (which has always worked for me) to 3.5.  I got to the third week and realized I wasn't having pred withdrawl and that a had flare started. I went back to 4mg (4days) and when that didn't work went to 5mg.  When that didn't work, and on the advice of Mrs. O and Eileen I went up to 10 mg to try and give it a kick.
Mrs. O said that she had to go to 10mg at one point because of a flare and after 2 weeks then went to 7.5 and 5.  My question and concern now is that I have been at 10mg for 3 weeks and have only felt like I did at 4mg for that last 5 days.  I really want to reduce from 10mg but am afraid it may be too soon. Help!!
I'm going to Mexico in 2 weeks and I was thinking that I would just stay at 10mg till I'm settled there but then I've been on that dose for so long will it affect my reduction?  Travelling hasn't bothered me in the past even at the 4mg.
I had a CRP this week and it was only 1.8 so not showing any inflammation.  My rhuemy, who I saw yesterday, suggested I might want to try Pacquil as a helper to reduce my pred.  I really don't want to take any more drugs.  Already on meds for BP, cholesterol and glaucoma.

"I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia 3yrs ago, after many years of pain. I am now considering Polymyalgia rheumatica. I am almost 65yrs.
I have bilateral severe groin pain with the right side worse. Have had groin pain for 30yrs x-rays indicate mild Osteoarthritis. Orthopedic specalist said hip in reasonable condition he has no idea what is causing so much pain. Rheumatologist says its ""Widespread soft tissue pain"" he does not like the term ""fibromyalgia"". Pain specalist says ""due to lack of any other diagnosis its probably fibromyalgia""
About 3 yrs ago this pain increased almost overnight to a severe pain in my groin. The pain wakes me at night it goes from groin along the front of my thigh then into the knee. I can lay on my rightside pain free for about 20mins then this very severe pain starts, I turn over to my left side and the right side still hurts, turn onto my back and pain improves however lately even on my back it takes a very long time to improve maybe now about 30minutes. I always wake stiff and sore in several places but maunly hips and fingers. It takes about an hour before I feel better. Recently I have been waking up from my sleep with pain in my hands, the knuckles in my fingers are stiff and painful they feel swollen but dont look swollen. I do not feel this is related to the fibro problems.
Wondering if anyone else has this and could it be Polymyalgia rheumatica. I just want some relief from severe night pain instead of being told its fibro and there isnt much we can do to help with the pain. I cant believe I can have this much pain and there is no help.
Thank you

I am increasing my preds from 5mg up to 10mg 2 days ago and am trying 15 mg today. my problem is and always has been knowing what is fibro and what is something else, ie. new pain, or diffrerent pain or something just not right, which the drs seem to dismiss and put everything down to fibro.
By the way the only pain relief that has worked on my fibro is prednisolone which i was given last year for a flare up and worked almost straight away, actually i asked the dr why inhadnt been put on them before!

"Hi everyone.
So glad to be back online after 7 weeks..but feels like a lifetime away! Flare seems under control and pred down from a high of 25mg to 16mg (first week at lower dose). However, still in some discomfort over shoulders and down arms but bearable. Have good days and bad depending on weather. Very cold and damp here in Oxfordshire at present! Probably goes for much of Britain lol.
Currently reducing 1mg per week although new gp wanted 2mg reduction and to be at 12mg by now. I said that the pain needs to settle before any further reduction should be attempted. Hence the compromise. I still feel that this is going too fast and I need time for pain to settle before reducing further. Am I being reasonable or just a wooss? By the way I have only just printed off the link to the Bristol programme for pmr, but have yet to show him suggested reduction plan advised due to internet problems. I am not due to see gp again until Mch 9th.

"I have been reducing pred very slowly (1/4mg) every two weeks. although I get some wthdrawal aches and pains, they last onloy about a week and are manageable. Once it evens out I did the next step. So, I am now down to 10mg of Pred. 
My problem though was that the hip, thigh and groin pain retured last October. After being dismissed all the time from my GP - I finally insisted on an xray. It showed mild osteoarthirits but he said, no more that you might expect for a woman my age...not sure if that is correct as he said most of us will have some aged 64.
I have asked for a scan, feeling sure I had bursitis and at last he has agreed. However, I began Bowen therapy on the advise of Eileen. It has made such an incredible difference. Each week the hips feel more and more comfortable. I could not cross my legs and now I can...however, it is still sore but would say 80% better. I have a few more sessions to go.
I have also (again on Eileens advice) started a low carb regime. I wonder if carbs in fact cause inflammation as I am not sure if this has also helped.
I shall stay on 10mg for another 2 weks and then do 9.75 and then 9.5...slow seems to work for me so far.

Then, a few weeks ago I noticed that if I stroke my lower forearm the pain becomes excruciating. So this sounds more like nerve damage to me which is confusing. Anyone else had anything like this? Secondly, I have now developed a very painful left  ankle/heel. It feels like a bad sprain although I can assure you I have done nothing energetic enough to cause injury! Any ideas?

"I really need some advice. A few weeks ago I started getting severe pains in arms, shoulders and legs which came on almost overnight. I couldn't move my arms in bed or roll over and getting out in the mornings it was like I had aged 20 years. Well you all know the symptoms. Could hardly get off the loo or downstairs. All the usual symptoms. I saw my physio who I have been seeing on and off and he thought it could be Polymyalgia. My late mother had had it too. After a blood test at doctors he has put me on Prednisolone for a week to see if things improved. Reading the contra indication it seemed like it was a no no for me as I have a rare condition called Zollinger Ellison Syndrome that means I produce excess Gastrin and therefore stomach ulcers.

I am on 40 mg of Omeprazole for life to safeguard another ulcerI also have osteoporosis although this hasn't caused a problem.

My experience is so much like BeckyL's I had to try seeing if I might learn some things. I have never had a spontaneous remission and it has been almost 9 years. I was in 3 serious car accidents and my doctor believes the trauma from these or perhaps a bout of Mononucleosis in 1983 may have been my trigger. When he checked my sed rates, the fact that I have persistent anemia, have had intractable migraine since puberty- all of these things together gave him my Dx of PMR/Fibromyalgia. He put me on 10 mg of Prednisone and I was a new woman. Since the original Dx I have had shingles once and have developed Lichen Sclerosis. I use Percocet and Flexeril for pain and stiffness and only usually at night and I hate taking these as I don't like chemicals but gave into them out of desperation. I tried Lyrica,Neurontin...quite a few drugs and have preferred just the Percocet- one or 2 at night and occasionally the Flexeril when really miserable, more than the daily pain. So many activities have been curtailed and I am 58-just- In January, (the 31rst). I care for my 2 grandchildren (ages 7 and 3) very often, since birth and it usually requires a couple days to recover after seeing them but I wouldn't refuse for the world. I have found heat (heating pad, hot baths, showers)my best friend- often more effective than drugs for relief. I also find light massage helpful- too deep and I am in agony. I still try to be active- walking, occasional bike riding, dancing, occasional lifting very light weights ( I find it near inpossible to rebuild any muscle mass- but the endorphins from exercise help me feel better). I was in school to be a Medical Assistant/Phlebotomist and though I completed and had a license to work I never got a job which is a mixed blessing because physically I doubt I could handle it.
Does anyone have pruritis(full body itching, sometimes intense, especially at night- wonder if its a side effect -drug related?
I have needle like pains frequently all over and warm tender spots throughout which I understand is inflammation.
I got shingles about 6 months ago and had some recurring nerve pain afterward.
I have been experimenting with some natural therapies like Pain Rx by High Tech Pharmaceuticals and Zyflamend with little effect.
I take Tumeric, fish oil etc to help with inflammation. Right now I am down with flu and it's been pretty ugly- been sick for 18 days now with a side of pink eye,tonsillitis as secondary infections.
I welcome advice and any further ideas for Tx. I am glad for this forum to read there are others who are successfully battling the ugliness of disease with me- helps with the loneliness of looking ok but suffering underneath and in an odd way it gives me hope.

"Hi everyone, I am looking for some advice or reassurance as I have not seen a Rheumy yet.  I was diagnosed with PMR 12th November 2014 and started on 20mg pred.  Seen consultant in Endocrinology on 8th January (who has referred me to Rheumy) she said to reduce pred down to 15mg.  I seen my gp the following day and told her it was too big of a reduction so I went down to 17.5 and I will be reducting this Saturday down to 15mg.  I am hoping to reduce every 6 weeks by 2.5 or less depending on how I feel.  It just feels like a long time without seeing a Rheumy so am more or less going it alone.  Thanks in advance for any replies.

"armed with boundless energy fueled by the daily preds I attacked the overgrown patch of self sown tomatoes and picked them before they fell off their stalks.
A couple of pin pricks on my shin which I vaguely felt through the slightly tight, slightly unfeeling, slightly less sensitive than normal skin and simply brushed off unthinkingly. None of my usual pathetic rush to the soov (lignocaine +) to stop any swelling.
So here I am. Two days later with an oversize bit of leg. Swollen and hard down the side of my shin and calf. About mid way. About 20cm (8in) long. Stiff to walk with. And the large (3in diameter) red spotty blotchy patches from the previous couple of insect bites have come back. My world is ending. Though the swelling is now reducing.
Not to mention the itchiness. Driving me madder. And the tube of soov is nearly empty. Too late for antihistamines and I don't like them anyway.
Probably an ant bite. They breed them tough in Aus. And of course every little reaction and bit of pain now gets blamed on PMR or Pred.
I don't know what I'd do if it was something serious like a paper cut .....
Some days all that's left is to laugh.
Tomorrow I'll wear trousers instead of shorts to pick more tomatoes. They are really a lot more tasty than the shop ones.

"Hi,  I am trying to get to the bottom of a long list of issues my mum has had since being diagnosed with PMR. She was put on steriods but was only on them for about a year and a half. She no longer takes them and just manages with her PMR. However since then shes has gout, shingles, what she calls a rash all over body apart from face that is horribly itchy and peels and also terrible water rentention in her legs. Does this sound familar to anyone. All the pills the gp has given her have had bad reaction (seizures) so I am really keen to work something out for her. Thanks

"I'm trying to shift my body from liquid foods (a smoothie a day) to solid foods but I have quite a few obstacles (reflux that feels like I'm swallowing hot coals for instance). All that aside, when I do chew food, it hurts the side where my GCA is the most dominant, which is the side where they did the surgery. My surgery was January 2nd. The site has healed but every time I put my jaw together I get a pain shooting up into the temple. The pain lingers after eating, so i have this really horrible headache. the headache then triggers the cranial nerve neuropathies and we have fireworks in my head.  Eating is not a joy. 
I wonder if anyone else with GCA has had pain chewing/eating and exactly when that pain stopped for them (if at all). I just assumed that 6 weeks after surgery it would be done with. I'm on 65mg of prednisone and my Rheumatologist treats this as not the original pain, but as a side issue that is for the most part ignored. I've had this pain eating since the beginning of the diagnosis.

"To repeat background info as an aid: 1st symptoms, Jan 2014. Diagnosed PMR May 2014. Current dosage pred, 9/10 mg. Current age 84. 
First, my apologies to the ladies on this forum most of whom suffer more than I and have many different reactions to both the disease and the meds. I know that my problems may not resemble yours. 
I am today seeking some information regarding PMR symptoms in lower extremities as opposed to same symptoms caused by claudication. The claudication is well known to occur in the aged and eds up being caused by the same inflammation due to decreased blood supply. I found that I was so getting accustomed to the 2 to 3 level pain which we call ""stiffness"" that I failed to put it in perspective as a treatable leftover of wrong dosage or early tapering, or of a different problem, claudication, which is also treatable and more positively diagnosed. Right now I am halting the dosage taper untill I can get a reading from a vascular specialist if possible.

"I was diagnosed with PM over 2 years ago.  I was 64 at the time and it hit me like a brick.  I went to bed feeling like a young woman and woke up feeling like a senior in a lot of pain.  It took a month before I was properly diagnosed and put on Prednisone.  I was on Prednisone for 2 years while gradually decreasing the dosage strength as recommended by my specialist.  I was off prednisone by last October and did not feel any pain at first but it gradually returned.  I can tolerate the pain most days and I do not want to go back on Prednisone which I am told is the only drug that can take away the pain.
I stared to experience numbness in my upper leg (between knee and hip) which, although not terribly painful, it prevented me from sleeping, etc.  It felt like it had gone to sleep.  I would massage it and put heat on it and gradually I could get to sleep.
This symptom has now gone but I am experiencing a ""funny"" feeling in my head which at times feels like blood or liquid rushing down my skull.  At other times it feels like little bugs running around.  it is not constant but a few times every day.  Naturally I am worried and want some answers.  
Because we all shrink as we age, I wondered if this was causing a pinched nerve in my back or base of my skull so I was sent to a orthopedic surgeon.  He checked me out and said that he did not think so and explained that sometimes the protective vertabrae around the spine shrinks with age and can cause pressure on the spine.
My concern is that the leg and head feeling are only on my right side.  All this to say, I originally wanted to know if there are others out there that basically still have the same pain although less severe after your doctor says you are well i.e. you blood levels are back to normal.  The pain defnitely mimicks the original pain but is tolerable.  My worse is in the groan area when I get in and out of the car.  Help, please.  Am i alone in this situation.
I am scheduled for a Catscan next week to see if there is anything to be concerned about.

Like a lot of blokes in their 60's I also suffer with OA, and to cap it all I'm living with the aftermath of shingles. As you can probably immagine, life can be a bit of a pain at times.
My question is this.....How do I distinguish PMA pain from OA pain (they are easily confused, well my doctor first diagnosed PMR as OA till I insisted on blood tests) from PHN pain. They all hurt but one pain is very much like another and I'm finding it a bit tricky jugling the medication.

"My 2nd attempt to reduce from 8mg to 7.5mg failed again. I stayed on 8 mg for 4 weeks and was feeling pretty good. Reduced to 7.5 mg and was not bad at first. Slowly over a period of 3-4 weeks the shoulder pain and neck pain got worse and worse. I have always had mild swelling and pain at the base of my neck even on 10mg plus prednisone. The rheumotologist never seemed to concerned about it. During this period of attempted reduction, I also was far more active dealing with snow shoveling, etc.
I decided I had had enough of the pain and went back up to 8.5 mg for a couple days. Then down to 8 mg. More snow shoveling, etc and the pain still pretty bad. Neck pain especially bad. I went up to 9.5 mg yesterday and the shoulder pain is far better. Neck pain is still about the same.
My questions are -
1. How long should I stay on the increase dose to handle this flare?
2. Has anyone else had neck pain(swelling at base of neck) that prednisone doesn't really help. During all my work up last June, xrays showed ""mild scoliosis"" at the base of my neck. Is it possible the neck pain is more connected to this than the PMR.
3. If neck pain is PMR related - is ice or heat better for relief. I have always used ice but just wondering...
Thanks for all responses and thanks for this forum. I read it religiously like probably everyone else who has this condition.

"I have another question about tapering the prednisone while I have a sore foot. I just taper from 10 mg to 9 mg during January and it went well. The opinion of this forum was to continue on 9 mg and not attempt a further reduction because of the navicular bone issue in my foot. I have read literature that says prednisone can reduce blood circulation to your joints, but prednisone should also be helping my injury, right? I saw the podiatrist in December...no fracture...and will see him again in March. Could the prednisone have weakened the bones in my feet, together with overuse, to cause the injury? Sorry to go on and on..have had the bad foot since November...been ""off my feet"" for over a week, icing and resting it. Thank you.

"Hello.  I have come to a place in using prednisone that is causing me to wonder what to do next.  I was taking 15 mg. of prednisone for about one month - it finally diminished much of my PMR pain so that I think it was working at that dosage.  However, I then developed Thrush in my mouth and had to begin treating it with nystatin liquid (I am in week two of this treatment).  After this outbreak I lowered my dose of prednisone to 12.5 mg. because that is the next step in the UK protocol treatment and I wanted to lower my risk of getting more fungal infections.  
At 12.5 mg. the PMR pain slowly increased in my body so I assume that 12.5 mg. is not enough to control the pain or that my body has not adjusted yet to that dose. This is my first problem. Ordinarlily I believe the answer to this increased pain is to go back to 15 mg.  However, there is a complication with that amount of prednisone that has me concerned about going back up to 15 mg.
 I have noticed another problem arising.  I noticed that I had herpes simplex outbreak in my nostril a few days ago, even after lowering the prednisone dose,  and now this morning, a herpes cold sore developed on my my lip.
What to do about these infections vs. pain control with prednisone?  I assume the prednisone is lowering my immune system so that these viruses and fungi break out.  Has anyone encountered this type of problem?  Taking the prednisone may lower my pain, but is it setting me up for worse infections?  What to do ?
Thanks to anyone who may offer me a direction.

"I am appealing to anyone who has been lucky enough to wean completely off Prednisone, for, at least, a while.
i am currently on 1/2 mg, for almost 1 month.
i am considering dropping to 1/4 mg, instead of stopping suddenly, and enduring unwanted consequences
i am not the same person I was, prior to PMR.
i don't have a lot of energy, andcan't paticpate in the sports Ive always loved.
 I am unstable, now. I don't walk a straight line, unless I focus, whereas before, it was natural.
Has anyone else experienced that?
 However, am not in any PMR pain, that I experienced initially.
i'm sure part of this lack of energy,slowed movement and motivation, is induced, in part, by age(74). Sarcoidosis (an auto immune disease), and lymphoma. Could PMR also help to create this change?
i am anxious to take one of these nasty illnesses, off the list, and the others are incurable.
it would make me feel that I have a little bit a lof control over my life.
any input would be appreciated.
i can't rely on doctors. They  don't always know the answers. I would rather get my responses from those who have suffered with this illness, and are willing to share and suggest. I have so much more trust in your knowledge.
i don't know how I would have gotten this far, without all of you.
thanks

"Don't misunderstand my title . . . it's no joke. It's life-changing, challenging and one big, often misunderstood battle.
My story is recorded in various posts over the last couple of years. Yes, I'm two and a half years in. Started at 30mg and worked down to 7.5mg. 
I saw the 'Rhummy' a few weeks ago and my blood test showed 3 (whatever's) so it is pronounced that the Polymyalgia rheumatica [PMR] has probably gone and I'm signed off and returned to my GP. I'm also told I seem to know what am doing with managing the Prednisolone and unless I go over 10mg the 'Rhummy' was happy to leave me to my own devices.
But having had to increase to 10mg in the lead up to a very traumatic Chrustmas and onslaught of personal pressure I got down again to 8.5mg. But the old symptoms are returning, so worked on the principle that it was most likely steroid withdrawal I perseved, covering myself with pain killers. But now some 14 days on thise symptoms still stay and I want to go back to 10mg and get some 'peace'. But if I do I know I have to come down again.
The ' Rhummy' has said he is not bothered if I stay on 10 (I assume forever!) but that's not the best answer unless he knows something I dont.
i suppose my question is ""Do people stay on 10mg for really long periods""?
Thanks everyone for being so great!

"Hello.
My husband was diagnosed with probable giant cell arteritis in November He has had several spells of facial pain and ultra sensitive scalp (not even able to touch hair without pain). One time also severe pain in the ear as well. This was put down to ear infection ???. However when he had what we thought was a virus as he had high temperature shivers shakes but no other symptoms in November we finally had to go to doc as pain was so bad he did not shave or want to brush his hair. Saw a trainee GP thinking it was neuralgia but she was concerned and ordered a blood test.
Had next day call from her to come in urgent.
Bingo ESR 68 & CRP 139. contacted the rheumatology next day then called to say get to surgery for scrip for steroids (40mg to reduce every month) and apt with hospital on Friday. (Biopsy ordered but cancelled twice) but 2 wks later tests well down after 7 weeks tests back to normal levels. We are so grateful that she picked up on this as we are sure that was the cause of the severe ear pain last January. If this is correct he is soooo lucky his eyes were not affected.
Oh his weight is up 6kg since end of November. :cry:
Thanks for reading.
Have any of you had similar symptoms early on. When ear infection diagnosis was made they were stumped by the scalp thing. But specialist said it could well have been caused by GCA

"Hi everyone, I was at the hairdressers today and she asked me had I noticed my hair thinning.  I hadn't noticed because I have very fine hair anyway but she did remark on it.  Would this be the pred?  Also these hot flushes, I am well past the menopause and even in this cold weather I rarely put the heating on it's as if I have my own built in thermostat which seems to on max most of the time.  My heating bill will be a lot cheaper if this keeps up.

"Saw my doctor yesterday my bloods have levelled since last time ,so we have decided that I should try to reduce .5 mg for a week or so then if all has settled to try to drop another .5 so that by the next blood test the middle of March I would have gone to 12mg of pred from 13 . She has also given me calcium tablet and a tablet I take once a week for the bones ,and to help with neck ,head pain Anotryptolin to take at nights .
Was a bit shocked last night to find that some of my nails while filing them disintegrated down into the pink area ,and are quite sore .Wish I had asked for calcium earlier .Am not a milk drinker or lover of yoghurt ,so anyone new on this eventful journey and who doesn't have dairy products please remberance the need for calcium .Also next blood test will involve a check on the chances of a  diabetas blood level indicator .So hopefully my moaning and groaning will not be coming to you all for much longer . Will be trying to go the Chertsie group in a couple of weeks which will make me realise how lucky I am to have this PMR just in the upper body as i realise reading this forum so many are much worse of than me

"i wanted to thank ""lodger"" for his reduction plan...it has worked beautifully...no problems! I reduced the prednisone from 10 mg to 9 mg and feel great. The instructions are to wait 2-3 weeks before going to 8 mg. Can I try 8 sooner than that? I have read about the dangers of tapering too quickly. Appreciate the input of all of you on this forum!...good advice! Thanks you.

"Thanks to everyone in their replies to my first post.  It has been such a blessing to find this site and have input from others in the same boat. You folks in England, Scotland, etc. are so lucky to have support groups for PMR. So far in my internet searches I have found no support groups in the USA or any forums.  I ordered Kate Gilbert's book which I have been reading and also one titled "" The Polymyalgia Rheumatica Patient's Source Book"" by Stephen Trutter, MA & Sue Feher, MD (Ed.) which I haven't started. Great info in Kate Filbet's book!! Hopefully more knowledge about this disease will help me understand  what I'm going through and how to cope.
I did see my regular doctor, an internist, on Monday for the first time since my diagnosis on Nov. 24,2014.  He was  the one who referred me to the Rheumatologist, and pulled strings to get me in quickly with only a two week wait.  Usual wait time is two to three months.  Here in Memphis, TN there aren't many rheumatologists and only two will see Medicare patients, which I am at age 72.
He was pleased with my progress, but did say that if I continued having difficulty with the prednisone dosage reduction to go back to the 10 mg. if needed instead of the 7 &1/2 I'm presently taking. He also said to give the 7 & 1/2 another few weeks to see if things would settle down, before going back to the 10 mg.  I'm also on Methotrexate 2.5 mg tablets, 6 tablets once a week at the same time or 15 mg. dosage.  Also I think part of the problem with not really pain but more discomfort especially in the thighs and fatigue I was having may be due to overdoing it physically.  He told me to pace my self better and to rest more.  Which I'm not good at doing but definately learning to do now.  I have started going back to the pool and just walking in the pool and doing a few reps of the aerobic exercises I did in my water aerobics class. I stay for 30 min., and I guess I may be overdoing it there as well.  Sure feels good to be doing something physical again, but I do seem to pay for it later. So ny plan for now is to stay at 7 &1/2 mg of prednisone for the next week to see how things go
One question: Do the doctors or rheumatologists in England use methotrexate?

"Thanks again for the warm welcome. 
yesterday I went in for my Endoscopy and all they found was an absolutely lovely digestive system. The thinking is that the prednisone (*sigh*) is the culprit here, triggering my peripheral neuropathy again and affecting my esophagus, thus triggering the burning sensation. Since I'm already on Gabapentin for the other Peripheral Neuropathies (namely the fireworks in my head), I should be covered. Just in case, they're changing up one of my reflux medications from omeprazole  to pantoprazole and keeping ranitidine. 
Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this neuropathy of the esophagus and whether it went away as the dose of steroids lessened. 
I find this latest thing particularly irritating as I'm trying to eat solid foods again. We have a family trip to Italy planned soon, and I absolutely refuse to sip my stupid banana smoothies and watch my family eat fabulous italian food while I sit there taking pictures. It's bad enough it's hard to swallow, i have no normal taste buds and no normal sense of smell (thanks, Prednisone!). Food shouldn't burn on the way down. 
would love to hear from others who may have experienced this particular weirdness.

"I was diagnosed with PMR in August 2013 (at age 64).  The pain came on quickly both in hip area and shoulders.  Had high inflammation in blood test.  My GP sent me to Rheumatologist but had to wait for months for appointment....But, he diagnosed it immediately.   Anyway, started with 20mg of pred.  Worked down to 10 mg very quickly and then slowly over the last year have gotten to 7mg where I have been for more than six months.  I was on Methotrexate  for awhile but had severe palpitations and headaches.  Rheum stopped that.  Two months ago, he started me on Hydroxychloroquine to aid in reducing the pred.  I had severe diarrhea so I've stopped.   In general, I feel okay and Rheum has tried to tell me not to worry too much.   But, he is trying to work with me on getting pred. down.
I am so thankful that I have found this forum.    I just, today, started the slow reduction process suggested in this forum.  But, I'm cutting it to 6.5 (from 7) instead of a whole mg. (ie one day low, six days reg dose, etc.).
 Anyway, I wish input on these side medications and how helpful they may have been for others.  Other than side effects, do they help?
And, I have also been trying to follow an ""anti-inflammatory"" diet.   When I do that carefully, I think I feel better.   But, not quite sure its the diet or just the pred working very well.   Does anyone have experience with this type of diet?  The Rheum has no ""information"" on whether this helps PMR symptoms.  But, he says its healthly, so can't hurt.
Thank you all for being here.   So helpful.

During this time I had to do a test on a running machine for a test on my heart because I was having trouble breathing on standing up after having been sitting for any length of time. Of course the maching showed that I did marvellous because I was on the predisilone. :roll: The specialist wont know this if he doesnt read what drugs I was on :!: I am just suffering my second dose of Polimyalgia and feel lousy with pains around my chest and in my legs and also coughing up some muck from my chest.

"I had arthroscopic surgery on Nov 18th on my ankle and a couple of weeks ago developed a rash on the outside of my ankle fairly close to one of the incisions.  It is only about 1 1/2  inches square in area and started by being very itchy.  I couldn't/can't see it very well because of the location but must have scratched it fairly hard and although it didn't bleed it scabbed over much like a mosquito bite would.  It is healing very slowly and sometimes gets itchy again. I now have pain in that spot and it hurts to lie with the side of my foot on the bed or sometimes when nothing is touching it at all.  I usually heal very quickly, even with the prednisone, and I can't quite figure this out.
I've also read a report done that says recent research has shown people with shingles are at a considerable risk of having a stroke because of the affect of the virus on blood vessels and that antiviral medication should be given as soon as possible. When I checked on the internet it says antivirals shouldn't be given to people taking immunosupressive drugs like prednisone.  FYI I am 65.
If anyone has experienced anything similar to this I'd love it if you'd share.
Thanks,

"Hi all,
Rather than repeat things I have posted before - which anyway would miss the contributions from others - I thought I'd put this under a new heading so you can look for yourselves.
If you type \""alendonic acid side effects\"" into the search box at the top of the page and then choose the \""arthritic/bone/muscle\"" selection which says there are 12 hits (I think) you will find all the posts we've had mentioning alendronic acid and problems with it. I have discussed the reasons why doctors are so keen we should take it (in my opinion, pressure from big pharma) and several people have reported having muscle and joint pain when taking it which has resolved once they stopped taking it.
I feel the bottom line has to be that, whatever the average GP (or rheumatologist) says, it has become a controversial drug which can be of use in certain circumstances (established osteoporosis) but which has been introduced as something which can be used to prevent something without any thought of the wider picture when used in very large numbers of people over a long period of time. Whilst uncomplicated and proven osteoporosis may well be a field where it should be used, in the presence of certain other diseases the situation can be very different. There is a parallel situation with statins. There is no doubt that very high cholesterol levels pose a risk - but the widespread use of statins to lower cholesterol levels that are only slightly raised may also have other effects where specific concommitant diseases are present. They too may cause muscle problems and some have been associated with the subsequent appearance of PMR.
As far as I know, there are no long term, large scale trials looking for interactions with other ailments - and whilst the clinical trials usually pick up the most serious side-effects, the numbers are relatively small. There is a scheme in place for reporting what are called \""adverse events\"" after a drug has been approved but it is well known that 1) doctors don't go to the lengths of filling in the reports and sending them in and 2) all too often the patient is not taken seriously when they say \""this medicine is making me ill\"". Just think how difficult some of us have found it to find anyone to take them seriously about PMR!
Enjoy your reading ladies (and gents if that applies) - I hope it answers a few of the questions that have surfaced over the last few days. If not - ask again and I'll go away and look for specifics :lol:

"HI people I'm writing this for my girlfriend, after being in constant pain for the past three years after some extensive research I find myself here so I'll give you a brief history.
Girlfriend is 18, 4 years ago, she fell down stairs breaking a few ribs, ever since then she has been in constant pain with constant throbbing pain in hips back and sides of body. This is a daily pain that doesn't really ease with pain killers.
Over the past 2 years she has had a CT scan X-rays which showed nothing, has been given different prescription drugs again with little results and now is under the care of a foot specialist because she has one leg longer than the other. This specialist has said this isn't the cause of the problems she faces and has recommended an MRI.
The doctor has said himself he doesn't know whats wrong with her.
After reading various threads on here it would seem like the most likely cause is PMR but how do i go about getting a diagnosis and trying to convince my girlfriend and her doctor this is what is wrong with her or even get testing for this.
My girlfriend is in her final year of a-levels and this has had a daily impact on education but shes struggled through and managed to get a place at UNI to study diagnostic radiographer but shes so down at the minute she doesn't want to go to uni because she knows she wont cope, so I'm desperate to try to get her the treatement she deserves so any advice anyone can give me I would be greatful to hear.
Many thanks in advance

"Hi all, this has probably been answered some time, but what should one do about a persistent cough from a lingering cold while having asthma and taking prednisone for PMR?  I woke up coughing last night so hard I scared myself.  I thought I was coughing up my guts!  I took two puffs of my emergency inhaler to help.  I have been using the inhaler up to 3 times a day as this cough goes on - I wonder if that's OK.  Does the pred. make my cold/flu worse or my asthma worse?  Any insight will be appreciated.  I'm reluctant to go to the doc, but I may if it keeps up.

"Yesterday a rheumatologist diagnosed me with GCA and, in an attempt to remove any threat to my sight, put me on 60 mg of prednisone immediately.  He based this on the PMR symptoms and some visual symptoms.  I posted about this yesterday.
He advised me to see my eye doctor.  She did not see anything at all in my visual symptoms characteristic of GCA.  She was surprised and disturbed that he made this significant diagnosis without more blood work and a biopsy.
Now that I have been on the prednisone, though only 2 days on 60 mg, the inflammation will be gone and there is no way, she says, we will ever know whether I really had/have GCA.  
She will talk to him today to see if he had any other information she does not know about.
I'll trust my GP to sort out the best thing to do.  I certainly am not staying on 60 mg of prednisone a day longer than I have to!
Good news but confusing!

"Unfortunately, I am under different consultants and surgeons due to conditions of my heart as well as GCA/PMR and they all seem to disagree with each other and I find the stress just exacerbates the pain and flares. Every appointment is a struggle! Blood tests from GP was told 'normal' then had to collect my CRP (raised to 17) from the hospital. Heart op booked for 5 weeks and then not because angiogram not done - the hospital lost the letter. Anyway the angiogram was done on Friday with 3 days warning for which i had to increase from 9mg up to 12mg as pain increased excessively, solely down to stress, I'm sure! All went well with clear arteries but had to be injected with valium twice - lovely at the time but not so good a day later. CRP down to 12. GP wants to talk to me tomorrow about raised CRP, I think and Rheumi wants me on methotrexate or leflonimide on 3 February! He doesn't consider the heart a problem despite the cardioversion in April and open heart surgery looming! I despair.

"Hello, I would like to know if you al ready had the injection each 6 months of Prolia ( denosumab ) as a replacement of Fosamax ( alendronate )? Had you problems, big side effects? Thanks to the advance for your answers and your help.
I promised to Eileen that I will make a follow-up because I had written a comment in the beginning of december because my endocrino suspected that I suffered from PMR but she did not treat me adequately. She gave me the hydrocortisone while the PMR is treated with the prednisone. I saw my family doctor and he took care of my PMR at the rate of 20 in the daytime. I was happy because it is one of those who believe that the weaning of the prednisone has to be very slowly made. For some, they will have to take one 5 mg in the daytime for the rest of their life. With his opinion(notice), we shall envisage no weaning before 6 months. It thus is to say that I get much better and I am feeling very confident with my GP because he know PRM and how to treat it.  I talked to him about Pred and osteoporisis.  He said:  It's true, but you must take Pred for a while and treated you to prevent osteoporisis as much as possible.  It would be preferable never taken Prednisone, but unfortunately, in certain cases, one needs.
The prednisone has changed my life !!

"I had a scan shortly after commending steriods two years ago and was found to have slight osteoporosis in spine and ostopenia in the legs and hips. I didn't want to take alendronic acid until I knew for definite that I needed it - and though my original rheumy said there was ""no point"" in having another scan as results weren't that reliable, my new rheumy agreed with me that it would be sensible, as long as it was on the same machine. So I had one today, two years on and though I can't remember exact figures I had lost something like 18% from my hips and legs and maybe 8% from my spine.
I now accept that I have to take the dreaded alendronic acid. The technician said that research in to broken femurs when stepping off kerbs etc were in people who had been on it for 20 years and jaw necrosis in those with cancer. She had been working there for 20 years and was a strong advocate of the benefits of alendronic acid - she also said the once a week drug had much better effects than the less potent once a month one.
Has anyone on the forum had good experience with alendronic acid? And are there any alternatives perhaps not available on the NHS?

"I have been taking Prednisone for 25 months for PMR. My GP (in Canada) doesn't know much about PMR and rushed me to get off Pred so I went from 20 mg to zero in 11 months. Of course I relapsed and luckily discovered this forum. I restarted at 10 mgs and quite easily but carefully came down to 4 1/2 mgs and have been at this level for over 9 months. I've tried several times to reduce to 4 using Eileen's slow method but about half way along the aches start up. 
Currently i I see my GP about every 6 months for my Pred prescription renewal and CRP blood test and I will see him soon. Should I be asking him to refer me to someone who can check my adrenals?
And if it is an adrenal issue, would that mean I would take a second medication or just stay on Pred for the long term?

I'll stay as long as it takes but I'd like to know at what dosage and how long it takes for some of the side effects to leave. I'm speaking about things such as memory problems, tremor, purpura, balance loss, etc. I'm sure I won't see any improvement at 10, but it would be nice to look forward to loosing some of the worst when I can get my dose smaller.

"Have had PMR for 2 years and am down to 3mgs since Jan. 1st.
T
oday my scalp on part of one side is very tender when I touch it plus rather stiff neck on same side.
I thought my vision was a bit fuzzy over the last 2 or 3 days and put it down to too much computer and telelvision. 
The pred reduction to 3mgs has not been great and I have suplimented with paracetamol when pain was bad, usually a couple of hours before pred. dose which I take at 8pm ish with supper.
This has made life managable.
Please can anyone help and tell me it can't possibly be GCA.  I don't have a headache?

"Hi my granddaughter has chickenpox which have appeared today, I am currently on 7mg of pred.
I have been taking it for just over a year reducing from 15mg last Feb, I read that anyone who comes into contact with chicken pox whilst taking pred should contact their GP, I have had chicken pox as a child.
I realise it has something to do with the immune system being low and should I contract the virus it could be severe.
Just wondered what can be done if anything ?
Do I wait and see if I contract it or should I be seeing the doctor as a matter of urgency ?

"A week after my 60th birthday in October my GP quickly diagnosed PMR. By this time I could not sleep at night and the burning in my arms and legs was so intense I could not raise my arms and had most of the typical PMR symptoms.
The GP gave me a hefty steroid injection and overnight all my symptoms went away as if by magic (thereby confirming his diagnosis) but I became hysterical and 'psychotic' on steroids. After only two weeks my symptoms returned with a vengeance so I was prescribed 40mg prednisalone but became quickly pyschotic again.
After two visits to the rheumatologist I have been prescribed methotrexate and folic acid as I can't tolerate steroids. I believe this a treatment for Rheumatoid arthritis for which I have no markers. After 7 weeks my ESR is down as is my PCR and white cell count, showing less inflammation, the general malaise has vanished, I have got my mind back though I still have some pain in my shoulders but each week that is receding.
I have been worried about the toxic effects of methotrexate but am assured by my GP that it is less 'dirty' than steroids and seem to be tolerating it well.
At the moment I am also taking 5mg prednisalone and also the antinflammatory Celebrex.
Yesterday I saw the rheumatologist who has advised me to start weaning off steroids and all the rest so that in a few weeks I will only be taking methotrexate and folic acid.
I would advise anyone to explore the methotrexate route. My rheumatologist was reluctant to prescribe as he thinks it does not work with PMR but my symptoms are classic and it is working. His get-out yesterday was to say that it did not seem to be Rheumatoid arthritis but a 'reactive arthritis' (PMR?!). I am thinking that he is collecting statistics to write a paper and I do not fit! My GP has assured me it [i:c95f5154ba]is[/i:c95f5154ba] PMR.
For me this seems to have started with a shocking cough/cold virus from last year - May to July - followed by shingles (July) and then PMR (Sept/Oct). This has followed a couple of extremely stressful years.
Lastly I also take the herbal remedy Milkthistle to support my liver with the methotrexate and this helps a lot.
I am dismayed to read about how long some of you are still suffering but
am so glad to have found this site and to be in contact with you all as I have felt very alone with this.

"I just saw a rheumatologist who diagnosed GCA (temporal arteritis).  I have posted in the last 2 weeks about my continued PMR symptoms with 15 mg prednisone and reduced symptoms with 20 mg but with a couple of quite  bad relapses.  I did not think GCA was in the picture because I did not have tenderness at the temples or scalp, headache, or blurred vision.
However, I did have very mild headache, just behind the forehead and unlike my usual headaches.  This was barely perceptible and nothing I'd even have considered taking an aspirin for.  
I also had eyestrain from reading- again nothing I'd had before but no problems with seeing to read.  I had a slight problem with little blind spots where I'd seen something a little bright- like the reaction to a flashbulb, but in response to sun on a white car or even on the floor.  I had one 15 minute event with a large blind spot in the lower left visual field and ""swirling"" vision and spotty vision in the center of the visual field.
The rheumatologist explained that the temporal artery branches after the temple area, with one branch going to the eye and others to the scalp.  He says I probably have arteritis in the branch to the eye- so no inflammation on the main artery or other branches.  So I did not have the ""typical"" headaches or tenderness in the temples scalp.
 I'm writing this to alert or remind people that GCA can occur without the classic signs and that even the SLIGHTEST visual disorder or headache should be reported.  Thanks to my GP, I was diagnosed with PMR immediately and he set up an appointment with a rheumatologist right away.  When I had the ""relapses"" and visual problems, he got them to move up my rheumatology appointment by 2 weeks.
As usual Eileen was right on top of this, suggesting I might have vascularitis in another vessel!
So now I just have to deal with 60 mg prednisone for quite a while!  Ick!  I'll have an infusion of Reclast to prevent worsening of my osteoporosis. The doctor predicts an unhappy several months of side effects.
Thanks very much to all of you who posted in response to my concerns in the last few weeks!  I greatly appreciate your kindness and your willingness to share your experiences and information.

"I just came upon this: ""The association of malignancy and PMR is well recognized.. . . ."" and ""Small-cell vasculitis in the elderly should always prompt a search for malignancy. . . .""
I didn't know this--at any rate, the site I read in this connection is a case study of a 73-year-old woman first diagnosed with PMR but who died some months later of B-cell lymphoma.
Here is site information if you care to read: 
http://www.nature.com/nrrheum/journal/v2/n12/full/ncprheum0352.html
Interesting that my primary physician, when I last saw home, said I needed to have an abdomen/pelvic CAT scan--obviously looking for cancer. I told him I couldn't put my arms over my head for the CAT, but that I was going to a rheumy who would probably put me on pred. The same doc also said I should have another heart test (name of which I have forgotten this second).
Now I am one week into Pred. 15 mg. and I have a rheumy to go see in three months, as taper continues and concludes. However, soon as I can I intend to go see primary doc again and begin the things he recommends.
Good grief but things get complicated. Any ideas, anyone??

"HI you all, I finally saw a rheumy and wondered if I should have warned her that I have a very good memory and am quite good with numbers before we talked.  More details below. But then I became puzzled, so I am glad I didn't challenge her but merely listened.
      She had an extremely narrow definition of what a PMR diagnosis needed.  I remembered how often you guys complain about your rheumies, and wondered why they dislike that diagnosis so much. 
         She mentioned a study done there where people were asked to choose between living 10 years longer in pain, or just 1 year longer without pain.  She said 80% of the subjects in the study chose the 10 years in pain.  I immediately chose the 1 year! Then she talked about ""the awful side effects"" of  prednisone.  Could that be why rheumies don't like the diagnosis?  The thought that most people, apparently, would rather live longer with pain?
       Many so called ""side effects"" of pharmaceuticals are really due to the disease or other confounding factors, not the medicine.   For example, cataract occurrence is largely age related, so to say that prednisone causes cataracts may be the result of a very poor study that did not adjust for age. As any epidemiologist will tell you, there are lots of crummy studies out there!
         In my case prednisone had absolutely nothing to do with my cataracts, they developed long before.   And it has nothing to do with my bruising as she thought: I have had blue spots caused by enthusiastic dog toenails for 20 years, long before any other problems. 
     In her narrow definition of PMR, she seemed to think one needs a sed rate in the 80s at least (mine was 37).  So my statistical mind asks whether that too is a false correlation. Surely, since there is no definitive test, it is just a matter of opinion. She also noted that I described pain and tenderness rather than stiffness, and thought I should have described stiffness.  There's a difference?? And I had butt pain rather than the hip pain she thought I would need.  So she was not convinced of the diagnosis despite my ""dramatic response"" to prednisone.  She said nothing about what else it might be.  So maybe that is the big question we have to ask: if it's not PMR, what could it be.  Fortunately she was not opposed to my continuing on prednisone, though she wants to get me off it in the long run.  That is a reasonable.  
         Then I remember she said PMR occurs equally in men and women, but of course it doesn't.  Women get it twice or 3 times as often.   Also the rate of PMR is increasing in Britain.  So my hypothesis is that they have stopped giving women HRT and that is causing the increase.  Both sexes lose hormones with age, but women lose hormones earlier.  So this might well account for gender differences as well as the late age of onset of PMR.   
     Rheumies have a lot more training in the subject that I do, at least I hope they do, and I would really like to understand their opinions more than I do.  Too often interesting scientific papers are not available without an expensive subscription to the specific journal, or a trip to the nearest medical library.

They said 30% of PMR patients are eventually diagnosed with something else, and talked about the necessity of ruling out other diseases that mimic PMR.  They also did not think that response to prednisone was a good diagnostic for PMR, but they liked ultra sound studies that look for bursitis.

"Hi - sorry I dont post much. I do follow lots of posts though.
Anyway...long story shorterned. Whenever I tried to reduce more than 1/2mg a month, i got quite bad withdrawal. But some time back my rheumy wanted me to try 10mg one day and 12.5 the next which was coming down from 13.5. I got severe pain in hips, groind and upper thighs so went back up which the rhuemay agreed to (Dr. Quick who wrote the Bristol paper). 
But the hips have remained the same which are very stiff in the morning and not very comfortable all day. My bad back also plays up a lot with painful vice grips in buttocks and lower back. 
I was sent for a pet scan and felt sure it would show inflammation in the hip area...but, it did not? So I wonder if this is a seperate issue for exampe pain related to the back. Its wild because I can feel the inflammation or at least the stiffness and pain.
Its unfortunate the PET has showed I have emphasemia so very depressed about that

"I got this as a pm this morning. It speaks for itself:
Dear Eileen, I hope you are well.
You have not heard from me for a year but as you used to be a very frequent contributor I hope you will still get my message.
I can not remember how to write a message to all, that's why I am sending it to you and hope you will make it accessible to all.
This message is important because it is a message of hope for all who are suffering as I have suffered.
Yes I am using past tense. 
You might remember that, after having had breast cancer twice, I woke up one morning unable to move because of excruciating pein in my whole body.
I was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica and treated with prednesolone (25mg) which made me very very sick. Beside putting on 20 KG fluid, I became half blind, my hair fell out and every organ of my body played up. I also needed additional Morphine patches for the pain.
After a year I refused to stay on this dreadful drug and got slowly down and took only morphine patches instead.
My body recovered, I lost the weight and my hair regrew.
After using morphine for a year I woke up one morning and felt no pain. I went cold turkey from 35mg down to 10mg morphine and was fine. After 2 years the
polymyalgia has disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.
So, to all of you, don't lose hope! I have been through hell and backwards and came out like the phoenix from the ashes. Praise God!
My very best to you Eileen and to all who are suffering.
Elisa
i would like to emphasise that Elisa used morphine patches only because pred caused her very severe side effects - it really isn't a real alternative for most of us and I do know some people found even morphine didn't cut the pain of PMR. It also does nothing to reduce the inflammation which is also causing damage.
I've posted it to show that PMR can and does go into remission. Elisa was lucky in that it only lasted a year - I had PMR for 5 years pre-pred and it never burnt out! It's always difficult to tell while you are on pred - but last time I tried to reduce to 5mg something was still there!

"Hi all and a Happy New year. just wondered if anyone can advise me on a decent over the counter anti-histamine to help relieve itching and rash caused by Hives. After a flare and withdrawal pain early last November by having to drop from 21mg to 10mg in 2 weeks my doc advised that the rash etc was Hives. I had to up my pred to 25mg but have since reduced to 18mg. As soon as I got down to 21mg the rash appeared (2 weeks ago and mainly on torso and arms) but the current doc supplied Atarax 10mg do not do anything to help apart from help me sleep for a cople of hours as they knock you out. I have been told that anti drowsey anti-histamines are better. I am hoping to reduce further by 1 or 1.5mg every other week and get down to 15mg or less and hope that the hives goes away. Has anyone got any suggestions or suffers from something similar. I realise this is only a small issue compared with others and know I am lucky just to have hives at present but even this brings you down. Good luck to everyone in their quest for a cure.

"I am a new pmr patient (one week), taking 20 mg. in four separate 5 mg. doses each day. It has given substantial pain relief, to be sure, and I think I would like to go on living with a bit of pain, rather than having the doctor try to lower the dose for more pain relief, which seems to be standard.
Is lowering the dose quickly, more and more--is that standard operating procedure? I can tolerate the level of pain I have now, but before I got the pred, it was unbearable, for sure.
Any thoughts would be appreciated...................

"This was a bit of a surprise as i don't remember what he said being discussed at my appointment! My son came with me and feels the same so maybe not just my 'brain fog'. I was diagnosed by GP in Feb 14 with GCA/PMR with 40 mg pred.Reduced to 9mg by Dec on instructions from GP and Rheumi. He agreed it was PMR in Dec but by then I was suffering from much pain in hips, shoulders etc with raised CRP. The letter states he advised 20 mg for 1 week then back to 10 mg. Appointment with specialist nurse in February by which time I have to decide, apparently, between taking Methotrexate or Luflonomide! I am afraid I ignored his advice (due to heart issue worries) and increased to 10 and then 12 mg. Have split the dose with 10 mg am and 2 mg evening and awaiting new blood test results, hopefully by tomorrow. if I can get CRP down then can I refuse the other drugs that I don't wish to take? Pain has definitely lessened.

"Sorry not to have posted for a while. Everything was going so well. I started at 15mg then reduced after 6 weeks to 12.5mg.Had virtually no pain about  a week in, apart from when I went down with a cold. I seem to have colds about every month at the moment. I went down with another one between Christmas and New Year. I rested felt better but the sore throat and cough has lingered. I woke this morning and the hip pain is extreme. I am due to reduce, should I wait until I feel better?
BTW, I got an NHS dexa scan at the local private hospital. My bones are in the green zone with a score of 1.3, so I am well and truly above the -1.5 where the BSR recommend I take AA.
I also prioritise what I need to do, I have cleaner now and she also changes the sheets. It makes a difference! I hear Eileen's voice in my head, ""Even if you are feeling so much better, do not over do it!"".

My doctor got me an emergency eye appointment next day, and the eye specialist said it wasn`t GCA, but probably the steroids.  I still have terrible blurred vision, drained and of course can`t drive and feeling quite house bound.  It`s a feeling like not wearing glasses when needing to!  has anyone experienced this, or knows that steroids can do this.  I have been on them for 3 years now, and never had this problem before.  Also having Fibromyagia  as well, I cannot tolerate medication (not even Adcal) but didn`t have a choice with the Pred.  Any ideas welcome thank you, as I don`t what to do about it!!

"Just a heads up that Holland & Barrett have a penny sale on and Manuka honey is on there. Today I bought 2 tubs of 24+ Manuka Doctor for the price of £28.95, so a saving of £28.95, buy one and get one for a penny.
Beware that they may not stock on the shelves, but behind the counter, as it is apparently their biggest shoplifting item!
Manuka honey is great as an anti inflammatory and general well being honey. I take a spoonful or two in my tea daily. It's expensive, but I think it's worth the money.

"hi...haven't posted for a while...couldn't get into the website...couldn't get my password via email!?!  Anyway...last communication I had a response from Eileen and lodger suggesting a ""staggering"" taper to try and get to 9 mg from 10 mg. I have tried on a few occasions to taper but was miserable. My doctor was going to start me on Methotrexate on February 1st. I have read about the methotrexate and was terrified. I started the tapering method suggested by lodger....and I am on Day 11!  Thank you for all the support! I wasn't sure how long I could stay on 10 mg because I don't know if the start of PMR is from the first symptom...or if you count from when you are really ""disabled"" with it...?

I'm feeling very shaky, weak, slightly removed from the world and with awful night sweats, - I'm having to change my nightie 3 times a night!
My question is, - is this caused by the level of Preds or is it a symptom of GCA?

"Hi everyone, I had my first appointment today since diagnosis of PMR  in November and am currently on 20mg pred.  Was at endocrinology today and after taking some details and examination I have been referred to Reumatologist (which should have been in the first place).  Consultant I seen today suggested I go down from 20mg to 15mg but to work it out with my gp (who I have an appointment tomorrow afternoon) to tweak it up or down just to see how things go until I see Reumy.  Is reduction of 5mg too much at start.  I know everyone is different.  I shall just have to wait and see how I fair but am going to ask my gp tomorrow to prescribe me 1mgs of pred, so I can manage not to drastically.  Also gound out today that ESR rates also goes by age it does not have to be below 10.  Apparantly 19 is fine for my age, only turned 60.  Any enlightment will be welcome.  Also a thanks in advance.

"After nearly 2 years with Prednisolone and Methotrexate I was finally getting the Prednislone down to the maintenance dose of 5 mg daily - the light at the end of the tunnel was getting closer... unfortunately my blood tests showed that this wasn't the case. Prednisolone dose is now set to 10 mg daily and the Methotrexate that apparently doesn't work for me is now to be dropped and I have to start with Mycphenolatmofetil - seems to e to be a pretty serious drug - with some possible drastic side effects - I already have various side effects from the 2 former mentioned drugs. Am just feeling a bit fed up with the whole process right now.
Anybody out there have any experience that they can share?
By the way - I don't have GCA in my head - it only presents itself in my body - I have no pain - a blessing for which I am very grateful and also I haven't turned 60 yet, so as I understand it I am younger than most who have this ailment?
Any input would be very welcome - especially if anyone is being treated with Mycophenolatmofetil.
Thankyou.

"A short while ago I mentioned I seemed to be developing a Hernia in the left groin area and wondered if it was pred related. since I have so many other conditions in addition to PMR.Athe time I was trying to reduce (as it turned out too quickly) and had got to 4/5 mg..Also I was feeling 'out of sorts' and depressed. After reading many posts on here 10mg didnt seem so bad after all.I upped the dose to 10mg,Result is that the swelling in the groin has all but gone.Was it really a hernia or was the flare targetting that area of my lower interstine.My depression has also become quite manageable.
This PMR thing is really sometimes a bit of a mystery.

"hi everyone,
pin November I had a total hip replacement on my left hip.  As I have had pmr for almost three years I have been up and down the steroids as most of you will understand.  Obviously my immune system is shot so a few days after the surgery I was found to have a deep infection in the hip and had to have it taken out.  I am now on a six week anti-biotic course and am waiting to go back into hospital to have my hip joint redone.  I saw my surgeon a week ago and he said he was going to write to my rhemy and ask him to completely take me off the steroids as it was not good having surgery whilst having no immune system.  Of course I said that it isn't that easy when I have been trying to reduce for the past three years.  He didn't seem to think it was a problem,  all he is concerned about is  me nor getting another infection.  Of course this has totally panicked me.  I am now waiting for my Rheumy to contact me as well as waiting to go back into hospital.  Can anyone tell me if they have the right to just take me off the pred without my say so.  My Rheumy isn't very sympathetic to my pain as it is,  all he ever says is that he wants me to reduce at a quicker rate than I am ready for.  I am following the slow reducing schedule I have seen on here.  I am on 12 mg at the moment going down to 11 mg,  it's a slow process but it works for me.

"Hello I was diagnosed with pmr 6 weeks after onset of aches and massive dwellings eventually I had blood tests, esr and crp rates of 95 and 97, you can imagine the pain I was in, not being able to move, sleep, wash or eat much.
I was put on 20mg steriods which worked immediately I tried to reduce slowly but getting to 10mg it came back in wrist and elbow areas so it was upped again. That was in February, I have now got down to 7mg but have some sack like swelling on my foot just below my toes.
I wondered if anyone has experience of this due to pmr, previously for me this area has not been affected.I am going to the doctors tonight but I am a little wary of them just upping my steriods.
My esr levels were down to 8 then crept up to 10 and 2 weeks ago they were 18, my doctor said it wasn't a sign of the pmr but maybe something else is happening.
Any advice for me please, this is my first time posting, but this forum has helped me to come to terms with this condition and handle the reduction of steriods in a sensible way. Thank you

"Hello
My name is Michael and I am 69 years old. I see a rheumatology consultant, but apart from diagnosing PMR, we don't seem to progressed very far in terms of managing pain relief.
He has put me on Methotrexare, Prednisilone and Co-Codamol. I'm not soft by any means, but the pain is with me all the time, sometimes reaching a high point say 5/10.
I don't think that he liked me asking him so many questions on my last visit, but I wanted to move forwards.
I've had injections in my shoulders which didn't help and have had a high dosage of 8 steroids per day to for a week tocombat a chest infection.
I've tried Fleiseq?, which didn't work for me and The only stuff I can find which provides some relief ere, ""Perskindol'"" from Amazon and microwaving a wheat pack.
My wife says that I always moaning about being unwell and my elder son, who is a Mental Healty Crisiis Social Worker says that I have emotional issues, so consequently I don't discuss it with them now.

Eileen was so kind to refer to the problem a while ago.  My question is, should I continue with Physical Therapy.....or consult my GP about a possible MRI to find a solution about the pain.

"I have become very depressed.Like many of you I have a lot to contend with and my depression gets worse for no apparent reason. This is my second year on Pred.I did tend to rush getting to  a lower dose and this makes me feel worse,though it's not so much the pain,which is bearable,it's a general feeling of malaise.When I was younger I could cope with any amount of stress but now the slightest thing sets me off.Its like a cloude descending and I just cannot shake it off.I did say for no apparent reason,but on analysis,it is somewhat event related.
I got down to 4mg and seemed to be coping.Then even my eyes started to ache(i have Glaucoma) and felt very very listless.In desperation I upped the dose to 8mg and my eyes and general malaise have improved.
Anyway I;m rambling!! Is this depression PMR related I wonder or is it just me??

It makes no difference if I am in or out or at home or abroad.
We have changed all the bedding and carpets etc.
I have seen the specialists and had the xrays and nothing can be found.
But every day at some time I have the attacks.
It is usually worse on a night and I rarely get a full nights sleep having to sit up to help counter the attack.
I am also on inhalers of all kinds,  and really am desperate for help.
We read about non acid reflux and mentioned this to the specialist who grasping at straws prescibed medication. I am already on medication for acid reflux to counter the problem caused by taking Prednisone for so long.
My GP then overruled  giving me it so another failure.
I obviously have tried increasing the Prednisone but no better.
Any help would be appreciated as I am running out of ideas.

"I have been on 7.5mg prednisone for PMR since mid October.  Well, right before Xmas my heart was racing. I thought I could ignore it, but after a couple of days I finally called the GP and they said ""get thee to the hospital immediately"", so I went.  I should have gone earlier!!  Anyway, they gave me a shock and my heart rate returned to normal and the next day, Christmas eve, I got on a plane and flew to see daughter, her spouse and grandkids.  
     My hopeful guess is that the cause of the episode was 2 diuretics on top of prednisone.  This made my potassium too low.  One of the docs said I should be on a potassium sparing diuretic.  If my guess is right I won't have a problem in the future if I get the diuretic he mentioned. They also put me on diltiazem to prevent the racing heart, and increased my thyroid medicine.  Nothing ever hurt by the way, but I have been more out of breath since then, which bothers me. 
     In January I will see a cardiologist for a  post hospital check, (my former cardiologist, who diagnosed my PMR, just moved to NY City) and, finally, my first visit with a rheumy. 
      So I am wondering if, in the regular monitoring you guys talk about, if potassium is one of the things they look at?  What other tests do they run for you in the UK?

As a nurse he does actually listen to some of the things i say(forgive me as i didnt know anything about PMR, only what i have learned in the last 12 weeks). My question is what is the research ,studies, thoughts etc about diet, exercise, rest, environment. Do certain things help because at the moment my dad thinks that if he just keeps going (quite fit,retired joiner so forever meddling, does way too much lol) that will be best. He has just started taking all his steroids as a morning dose thanks to the forum advice. I would like to give him words of wisdom about other aspects of the illness that could be considered.

"Hello I am a newcomer to this site and just wondered if somebody could possilbly help me.
I was diagnoised with Fibromyaglia and M E  around 4 years ago. I was pretty healthy at the time, but have a viral infection and was left with this diagnosis by the doctor and a specialist in Fibro. Over the years I have gone from tramacet to tramadol and finally slow release oxicodone for the pain. About 3 months ago I started with a very stiff neck and pain in my actual arm joints, shoulders and hips, even with my slow release morphine I cannot get rid of this pain. I went to the doctors and was deemed to have hardly any vitamin d, I have had a intense vit d spray for 2 months that hasnt done much.
Last week I had to go back because this pain has got so much worse, the doctor now says he thinks my Fibro has turned into Polymyalgia.
Repeat blood tests have been done but Im not sure of the results yet as I cannot get an appoitment until 15th January, but I do know the vitamin d was still adsent.
Over the last 5 days my arms have been hurting so much I can hardly brush my hair, I also have pain in my knee joints. I have had a look on the internet (as you do) and saw this forum, so I wondered if anybody on here has the same sort of problems. Thank You Diane

"my father is 88 and has been treated for PMR a for the past 4 years. He is currently on 17 mg of prednisolone after a flared up of his PMR and COPD exacerbation (he has never been a smoker but had chronicasthma), he also had  a small MI 10 years ago. At one point his GP had him on 60mg of pred. He sees a rheumatologist(last time it was a specialist nurse) about every 6 months. He also discovered that he had silent bilateral ruptured Achilles tendons! He is mentally very agile and sociable but loves walking and cannot go very far and only on the flat.
He has never been offered any other treatments for the PMR. He has serious proximal leg muscle weakness and therefore struggles with steps and stairs. 
I have several questions.
1. Is his weakness due to the steroids?
2. How good is methotrexate (or other treatments for PMR?
3. How dangerous and effective are other treatments?

"Hi. Back in October,  I think had a flare whilst trying to reduce from 9mg to 8mg. At first I thought the pain was just withdrawal symptoms and just got on with things (am in the process of moving house). However, the stress levels rose dramatically due to incompetent solicitors and threats from developers. It's a long story so I won't bore you with the details other than to say that finally commonsense prevailed and it was agreed that I could exchange
on19th Dec and complete on 6th Jan. however, I am now left with constant pains in my shoulders and arms which is not relieved by the pred. Currently I
am taking 15mg and have great difficulty in raising my arms above my
head/reaching out front/ and gripping things. It is now having a huge impact
on my life (dressing, driving, packing). I would increase dose but do not think I have enough supplies to carry over until I can register with a new gp (am moving to Oxfordshire from Harrow). Current gp not interested any more as I am moving away. Happy for me to stay on 15mg but no more. Suggested I take up light exercise instead. I have been reading all the recent posts about methotrexate and worry that new GP may prescribe something I do not want to take. Also, that new GP may not even understand PMR anyway. Is there a way of vetting doctors surgeries? Probably not. But I live in hope. It's all I have now.

"In my recent post about fighting an arrogant Ruemy, I mentioned his putting me on Methotrexate 10mg/week. I took the first dose on the 17th of this month and had some blood tests done on the 19th that were pending from the Rheumy and other specialist. I just looked at the results this AM and found my blood glucose having shot up to 131 after being perfectly normal for a year (4 tests). I immediately started a new search for correlation and did find it as a side effect. What is just as interesting is the complete lack of PMR as an indication for the use of Methotrexate. To be sure I am not using the very harsh drug and will be dropping the Rheumy. My GP can do as well as he for certain.

"2nd appointment with rheumy today and what a change from last time when he was grumpy and suspected fibromyalgia which is 'all in the mind'! He was very sypathetic and understanding - which was refreshing. GCA/PMR diagnosed by GP in February. Prednisolone 40mg prescribed with great relief but followed by heart problems. Have now reduced to 9mg but with raised CRP and much pain. He said definitely PMR/GCA and suggested increase to 20mg over Christmas then reduce to 10mg and wants me to take Leflonomide. Have no idea what that is but looked up side effects and wasn't enamoured! Previous suggestions by him and GP was to keep reducing 1mg a month but when CRP raised to 14 GP said to stay on 9mg and not reduce. CRP now down to 12 on 9mg so I am tempted to suffer a bit at 9mg as I think an increase now could affect heart (largeASD tachycardia risk awaiting op) and don't fancy Christmas in critical care!

"Lots of information on the site and I have been reading a lot. My initial diagnosis of PMR back in June was questionable from my GP who then referred me to a Rheumatologist. Me ESR(9) and CRP(4.4) were both low but the onset, type and location of pain and the immediate relieve from 20 mg prednisone seemed to confirm it for the Dr. Lots of other tests, xrays, body scans, lyme disease etc. All negative except for some arthritis in an AC joint and mild osteo in my neck.
Can it really be PMR with those types of numbers? My latest bloodwork shows ESR of 5 and CRP of <2.9. and="""" vitamin="""" d=""""><9).the dr. put me on 50,000 units vitamin d  once a week for 4 weeks.
before this whole thing started i had developed some new allergies?? to foods especially cheese products. after the pmr diagnosis i read about inflammatory foods and cut all milk cheese, ice cream :-( etc. from my diet.

"Some recent posts touched on areas very close to my concerns about GP's and Rheumy's attitude towards their patients when confronted with good data obtained from an outside source. I have become spring loaded when it comes time for a checkup with my Rheumy, knowing he is going to reject my ideas on the treatment plan and insist on schedules and meds that do not really fit.
On the 16th this month my checkup was started with a young female  Rheumy doing the leg work of collecting current info from me and listening to my current condition and dosage. I related that due to old symptoms coming back when getting down to 8mg, I had reverted to 10mg. Then after that info had been relayed to my regular Rheumy he came in and began a systematic lecture about the dangers of being on a 10mg or higher dosage for very long. First was the bone density factor, then the osteoporosis tendency and finally the danger of being turned down or delayed for major surgery. And to make it all worse he talked me into a 10mg/week dose of Methotrexate, with 1mg of folic acid/day for bone strength, and a bone scan yet to come. Any new med brings new side effects to deal with, and although he is saying that I won't see any effects at that low dosage, he is not me.I am already taking Vit D and calcium. I did not want more medications on top of the lot I am into. I remind you that I have only been on pred since middle of May this year and really wanted to stay at 10mg for awhile after having returned to that dosage. I tried wqys of insulting his narrow minded approach but was only reminded that ""This is what I do for a living"". 
Please repeat the straight story about Methotrexate regards it's ability to control PMR symptoms while trying to reduce the dosage. And what about Osteoporosis as a factor in using pred?
I am tired of being bullied by people in the medical here in US. They really think they are God. There are maybe 350,000 doctors in this country and they all think they are right. ""Please dont blind me with the facts"".
Thank you all for being there and have a great holiday.

"Hi I've had PMR for 4 years and for the last 4 months I have had sciatica which fingers crossed seems to have receded, I saw my rheumy last week she is insistant that I reduce pred altogether as she is convinced that the PMR has gone in remission (blood tests etc). Trouble is no matter how I reduce pred slowly or otherwise I end up feeling tired and giddy she wants me to reduce down from 9 mg (my present dose) 1mg every 2 weeks which I said was impossible. I have posted on here and on healthunlocked lots of times so everybody is probably sick of hearing me.Wendy

"As a recently diagnsed PMG individual, I am finding I cannot get my prednisolone dose above 10mg/day. If I try to increase it my BP rises significantly and I also get palpitations. My BP has never been an issue before taking prenisolone. For the 1st few weeks my symptoms seemed to be well controlled by 10mg but that control is already less effectiv. My inflammatory markers remain very high but I am working on symptom control rather than a focus on them. Has anyone else had such issues re steroids and hypertension? If so did you find another soliution? If so what was this?

"Halllo everybody!
After 3 1/2 years I have come to realise that I am a perfectly ""normal"" PMR sufferer.  Up until I found this site (about 3 months ago) I was alone.  I had this very disabling illness,  I didn't understand it, it wasn't improving, and I didn't WANT it!!!    Now, after reading all your stories, (some of which are truly awful) I realise I am one of the ""lucky"" ones.  Also, I now have people I can laugh/cry with, I have pen-pals all over the world and I am beginning to understand this peculiar illness.  Thanks everyone!
Have a great Christmas and a pain free 2015.  (I heard some of you groan then!!)

For months I have had one, and I have changed my blood pressure tablets three times, thinking it came from them (I had trouble getting the right tablets when I started taking blood pressure tablets 33 years ago!).  This morning I read this cough can be a side effect of prednisolone.  Lovely, I'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future!!!

"I started having excruciating unfamiliar pain in my left upper back last January. GP prescribed Lyrica and Tramadol. Pain went after 3 weeks, but painful area of skin remained 'numb' like and sensitive as if the nerve endings were exposed. Eventually all symptoms went away until April when the pain returned on my rights side. I had muscle spasms in certain 'vulnerable areas (IBS type abdo pain on right and a muscle that 'spasmd' for no apparent reason since turning 50 ish) a very tender area at back waist level and, again numb like exposed nerve skin at the painful areas. Also pins and needles in my hands.CRP was very raised and slight anaemia.
Specialist diagnosed polymyalgia and put me on 20mg prednisolone. The relief within 2 days was miraculous. My bloods all returned to normal then, when I got down to 12.5 mg pred 3 weeks ago, the pain returned in my left waist area plus the numb sensations. My GP thinks its neuralgia and prescribed amitryptiline. Hasn't done much so far. Am still taking 12.5 mg pred.
Anyone had similar please?

"just a thankyou to all who share their experiences.
I'm a fairly fit 65 years. Its my first anniversary for PMR! I was in Nepal when symptoms appeared. Just driven through Tibet. Part way through driving from UK to Aus. Excruciating pain, limited arm movement, limited walking. Struggled to climb into and out of cab. Involuntary screams - that isn't me. Vehicle maintenance took a hit. I couldn't even change a fan belt. The pain from contortions while stopping a near electrical fire still haunts me. No real opportunity to shorten the drive so carried on through India and Myanmar to Malaysia. A couple of weeks on a Thai beach, swimming every day, didn't help. No potential for reliable diagnosis. The local doctors were more used to typhoid and malaria. A bit scary really as independent travel can be quite demanding without additional obstacles.
April in Australia before diagnosis and relief. The day after landing. I've been lucky with doctors. Now down to 5mg/day pred. Under control as long as I don't do too much in the garden - three years of growth to tame. The change from 3 years continuous travel to a sedentary stationary life is interesting and not without stress. We needed a rest.
I'm also extremely independent. Not used to needing help.
I've fortunately avoided lengthy depression from the pred. Just a few short lows, and I've enjoyed the longer highs. Been surprised by sudden mood swings. Wondered at short term memory loss. And so on. I was offered some work which has kept my mind occupied, but at times its been a struggle to concentrate.
Reduction in pred has been appropriately slow. The pattern of reduce a bit followed by flare up for a few days could become an impediment. Lots of excuses for not reducing. But I think I'm lucky to keep finding a balance between pred dose and stable condition. Just enough stiffness, pain and numbness to remind me but not enough pain to inhibit me. Flare up in a different place each time. Last one I was unable to grasp anything due to pain in fingers.
I've always had chronic headache and in the last 25 years back and leg pain (leftover from op). The pred is masking other problems nicely. Another excuse for not reducing.
So I write up the line in the diary the night before and simply take less as planned, even though everything I know says don't. A bit of resolve needed.
I've had Hashimoto's Syndrome for a few years. But basically I'm relatively stable, steadily reducing the pred dose, living with the pred side effects. Still a long way to go, but getting there. My cup is more than half full.
Probably all ""text book"". But most of the understanding I have of my condition and management of the pred has come from this group.
So thankyou again for all the help. Happy Christmas to all.

"I am a 52 yr old male and have been dealing with pmr for 2 1/2 years.  Initially my  pain was in my hips and legs and eventually  moved into my shoulders.  I have been on prednisone for 27 months now at various levels.  My latest taper brought me down to 2mg.  I am currently experiencing pain in my sternoclavicular joints and across to my ac jt on the left side and have a little swelling anterior to my trapezius muscle in the hollow area above the clavicle.  Lifting my  arms is difficult and causes pain in my sc joints and on the left side across to my clavicle. Also when lifting my left arm I have pain that shoots up the side of my neck and behind my left ear.  I called my rheumatologist and she moved my dose to 4 mg which has helped some but still having some pain.  It is worse with inactivity which is consistent with the pmr but just wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms as I am a little concerned that it is unrelated to the pmr. I appreciate any input.

"On December 13, 2008 I stopped taking pred and have had no flares since. The reason I chose to say I stopped on December 13 is that it is a date easy to remember as we celebrate Lucia, the queen of light. I was at the end of the tunnel and Lucia was waiting for me with her lights! So there is a light at the end of the tunnel also for you!
I was lucky not having a bad pain all the time. It took me 3 ½ years to reach the end, and especially  at 5 mg I had to wait for a year due to fatigue. After waiting that year I found out a tapering method with one day new dose, two days old dose and repeted this, and after a week I took just the new dose. I tapered 0.5 mg at a time. Slowly does it. After many had tried this method, especially ElaineH has improved the method for those who still cannot taper without pain by lengthening the period before going over. This can of course be done in many ways but you can follow the ElaineH scheme that she has written on this forum many times.
When I started to follow this forum in 2005, there was not very much information other than what the doctors gave you – and that wasn´t very much. I am glad that this forum has helped so many during the years. On the Northeast forum, we have a Club Zero for those who have come to the end of tapering pred and reached 0. I think it is very valuable that also those who are off pred still continue – at least once in a while like me – in order to encourage those who are fighting to reduce and are in pain. Besides me I can mention some in this forum that also belong to Club Zero – MrsK and Mrs O for instance.
Keep on fighting but very slowly!
If you want to get more information about celebrating Lucia in Sweden, look at https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/lucia/    
From a German friend I received a paper clipping many years ago. Som funny looking persons in white dress wearing what looked like a cross but was a star on a pole. The police in the USA thought it was members of Ku Klux Klan but were released after an explanation about celebrating Lucia.
Every year, the Nobel prize laureates spend about a week in Stockholm and they usually stay over the Lucia day. It was told some years ago that a very old Nobel laureate thought he was in heaven and saw angels when the Lucia and attendants woke him up with singing the traditional songs. Those who stay in Stockholm for that day are celebrated with a Lucia and attendants

"I have hit a Prednisolone barrier. Following Eileen and the Forum's advice, I have followed a slow pred reduction from 400mg, reaching 15mg at the end of October. All was relatively pain-free. I dropped to 12.5mg on two occasions in mid-November, a week apart. That had minor pain repercussions. Then suddenly, before the next scheduled reduction to 12.5mg, I was felled by a deluge of back, shoulder, neck pain and headaches. So I abandoned the reduction plan, remaining on 15mg all this month. However, I can't return to that pain-free period. The pain and discomfort are with me from late evening until the following midday.
This has been a huge disappointment and am not sure where to go from here. I'm aware of the stress factor in PMR and wonder if this set-back could be as a result of my selling my home and the current exhausting and often frustrating preparations involved in setting up another?
I leave for the UK next Thursday for Christmas with my children, and the thought of this 20-hour journey does nothing for my headache!
Fellow-sufferers, do I battle on at 15mg and hope I will eventually return to those pain-free days on this dose, or do I accept defeat and up the dose? I can only get 5mg tablets, so can't try an increase of anything less than a halved tablet of 2.5.
I am only six months into this horrible journey with no illusions of the long road ahead, but feel such despair when reading posts of successful reduction programmes - and humps being hit at a halcyon 4mg...
My thanks in advance for your suggestions.

"Just hypothesizing:  read BBC online a minute ago and one theory for Rheumatoid Arthritis increasing in women recently is that there are lower hormones now in birth control pills.   So I am speculating that lower hormones in both men and women could be behind PMR , --we are generally older people with fading hormones-and I wondered if anyone had ever tried to treat it with hormone pills.

"I am new, My endocrinologist has just informed me that my pains shoulders, hips,and sometimes ankles could be PMR.  I see an endocrinologist for a follow-up post radiotherapyfor a cerebral tumour which can bring hormonal problems in the short or the long term.  The first time I saw her, she spoke to me about a possible surenal insufficiency coming from the surrenal glands or gland in the brain which does not send the good signals to produce cortisol.  I passed from 40 Mg to 7.5Mg of Prednisone in 7 months to take Hydrocortisone 25 mg/day.  1 1/2 month afterwards, I started to feel pains with my shoulders initially, then hips, ankles. I take now 30Mg of hydrocortisone/day.  I am a little better, but certain days I am not really functional.  Feeling of fever, pains, tiredness.  I read that the PMR could be due to  a low cortisol rate.  Do I wonder if my endo ask me to tapper Prednisone too fast ? Did you have blood tests to measure your cortisol rate while taking hydrocortisone to know if it were the good dosage?  Me not and  I have doubts. I see that the PMR is treated with Prednisone.  As my endocrinologist only aims at making me decrease hydrocortisone and possibly stop it, She did not prescribe me any tests to confirm PRM and cortisol level.  I thank you very much for your opinion, experience it could help me !  I think it is better to see a rheumatologist for PMR ?

"Thank you Mrs.O for all your helpful advice in dealing with PMR.  I have found out so much more since finding this group.  I was diagnosed with PMR about June this year and still wonder if the change in my BP medication a few months earlier might have triggered PMR.  However, I am thankful that the crippling pain and swelling cleared after the first few days on 15mg Pred.  The sudden ability to do tasks I had been struggling with was an enormous boost tho I now see perhaps I should have taken things slowly.   I had even given up driving as the pain in my hands made it almost impossible to open the car door or turn the ignition key.
I am now on 10mg.  A blood test a few weeks ago did show a small increase in inflammation but as I had a cold at the time and no flare up of the pain I stuck to the 10mg.  I would like to try reducing again and the idea of alternating say 10mg with 9mg sounds a good start.  I will see what my doctor says when I see him on 22nd.

"Hi Im new here. Im 59 years old, and was recently diagnosed. My CPR and Sed rate have been elevated ever since I can remember. I had a first episode when I was in my 20's. I periodically would have episodes, they would slowly go away. There were some years when I was ok. At some point when I was working a lot I started getting extremely bad cases, I was so tired I had a hard time even keeping my head up. I could not lift my arms to brush my hair. I do have a back and neck injury from age 16- horse fell on me, so I assumed some problems were from that. I suffered a lot for years with extreme pain in muscles, deep pain. My scalp and nose get tender when I get an episode. Fortunetly I saw a good Dr. who even though most of my autoimmune tests were negative tried me on prednisone. We tired a small does and tapered off.. I felt somewhat better but when I lowered the dose it came back. Then we did ""bursts"" 40-60 mg. for one week and taper slowly off after 2 months. OH my ,, it worked, for first time in many years I got a break from everything, miracle. I had to have 2-3 treatments a year. Then after a few years I didnt have so many problems.,. I am diffinetly sensitive to sunlight and almost for sure I get an attack/episode every spring. I know this is not usual for this.. My doctor said we do not know what it is ,e xpcet it is a autoimmune disease that responds to prednisone.. I wouldve killed myself if I did not have prednisone. I do not drink , smoke, Ilive a healthy life. The only thing that makes me feel ok, is prednisone. But I have to take at least 40 mg to start to knock it all the way down.and keep it down. Fortunely I have only had to have 1-2 treatments a year for the past 5 years. If I over exert myself , it can bring on a long lasting episode. Recently I saw a new GP and she gave me the PMR diagnosis. Im not 100% convinced. But maybe I am an anomoly. Lately Past year I have been having extremely painful spasms/contractions in my major muscles of my legs , and when I bend my arm and am carrying something, a stabbing, crabbing pain in my biceps (makes me drop whatever I am holding) Id like people to describe their pains or limitations all the internet sites just say the exact same thing. To me when I try and lift my arm it feels like opposite pressure. Like to go up some muscles are opposed and pull the other direction, or like there is no blood in my arms, that kind of fatique,, if I keep trying to hold them up , extreme pain. same feeling with my leg muscles.. If you ever ran a marathon to point where there is pain then no control over muscles that is what happens.. When I am extremly tired and try and make myself continue walking,working, I fall down, I have hurt myself a lot that way. My joint ligaments, tendons tend to tear easily . When I feel sick my vision gets blurry , I get constant headache - often times I will have a slight fever.. when I am having a bad episode.but all goes away when I take prednisone. I also have trouble swallowing when I get very tired and sick /choke. When I take the prednisone, itis like magic... miracle drug for me. I have gained a lot of weight, but the relief from my disease is worth it. Would like to hear other people who have similar symptoms.Other things I deal with are 2TKR, neck surgery, 3back surgeries, asthma,copd , arthritis,type 2 diabetes, and a few other things. thank-you!

"My doctor was very resentful that I knew more than she did about my illness. No patient should be expected to diagnose themselves but this is the case with many patients, especially those suffering from Giant Cell Arteritis who are dismissed by GP’s when they should be referred to a specialist. Even doctors, when unwell, see another doctor for diagnosis and medication. No patient should be expected to prescribe for themselves either, especially without access to previous health conditions, blood test results, scans, etc., and without medical training and experience. Telling your doctor how to treat you is a shocking indictment on the training of our medical practitioners. It is necessary to campaign to receive better treatment and you can do this in several ways. PMR and GCA are often referred to by high ranking specialists as being a condition of 'the elderly' - a disrespectful and illegally ageist term which can mean 'over the age of 50'! If you are unhappy with the treatment you receive from your doctors, contact your MP, the Health Secretary, your local Healthwatch. Each magazine for GPs and hospital doctors covers a number of illnesses and should cover autoimmune illnesses more often that they do but because they have little to offer in the way of expensive drugs, they are swept under the carpet. I have been shocked that GCA, which can result in stroke, heart attack, dementia and other very serious life long disabilities, is dismissed unless someone has a headache in their temples. This is because if someone does have pain in their temples, they can go completely blind, and this can result in a legal claim for damages which would affect the doctor. GCA can stay in the arteries for at least a decade after the last symptom has disappeared, causing lesions, weaknesses and artery damage which can affect vital organs. However, it is impossible to prove after the event, that any artery or organ damage was caused by GCA. I probably have artery damage due to misdiagnosed GCA and I am very angry about this indeed.

"I am a 66 yr old male with reasonably good general health, except for osteoarthritis, mostly below the waist!  My PMR journey began with a visit to an orthopedist in Sept. to discuss my knees and hips. He wanted to eventually replace both knees and right hip (left hip is a 20 yr old still-viable artificial) but also took note of significant inflammation in his X-rays. He asked some questions, and I described the mysterious pains ( to me) in my arms, shoulders, and stiffness in my hips. He sent me to the lab, which showed high CRP and SED rates, so he said I needed to see a rheumi. Couldn't get an appt. for 4 weeks, but in the meantime my GP, also seeing the labs, and noting no typical visible RA symptoms in my joints, postulated PMR and put me on 20 mgs. PRED. Results as expected. Rheumi confirmed diagnosis, and started on very quick reduction. In 3 wks, at 10 mgs, had my first flare, which was like I'd never taken anything. Rheumi said back to 15; GP back to 20. I went with GP and and a few days later, still with little relief, he cranked me up to 40, with good results. Now also on something for the bones, and working a much more gradual reduction.
I have found many answers on this forum already, for which I am grateful. Have a few questions, too. 1)does caffeine play any rôle in the delivery or efficacy of PRED ?  2) The rheumi also put me on Cymbalta for osteo pain; I'm sure if I can discern any benefit after 30 days (I also take 3000 mg Tylenol daily).. And experience with Cymbalta as a pain med?  Thanks.

"I am interested in seeing how others deal with what must be part of the ongoing path!
M Prednisolone intake is now after two years down to 7.5 but the lower dose has unleashed what was there before. I have had to start taking my oxetetracycline as Rosecrecea shows signs of returning and I know it's not alcohol but it does not stop those I know having a dig! Then eyes starting playing up and I need to use Blephagel most days. Then the big one backache kicks in with a vengeance.
None of these were evident at 10mg but all poking their heads up now. . . . I am pretty sure the PMR is down to only needing 5mg but if I move down I know the back will become unbearable. Tennis, that's what did it and did it well. Long before PMR I was having regular 'sports massage' which works for a few days then all gets knotted up again. I've squashed the lower disc and got a bit of a spur on one bone. 
Taking a a wrong move starts it . . . Then the muscles go into spasm and that's it for the day.
What am I asking?  What painkiller do I put with Prednisolone and how do I manage this second but old problem?
Firgive the spelling!

"hi,
new to this board, frustrated, and hoping I will be lucky enough to get some feedback that will lead me to make correct choices.
diagnosed with PMR, in May, of this year. 
I was in a wheelchair, by that time, because local doc's thought it had something to do with my lymphoma, and couldn't get beyond that.
a shot of Pred, 20mg. Had me up and about, in 20 minutes.
since May, 12th, I have been tapering every3-4 weeks, and at 5mg, I tapered 1 mg. down, at a time. At 2 mg, I tapered by 1/2 mg,  and stopped, 2 weeks ago, altogether, 
After 8 days, I felt a little bit of discomfort in shoulders, a little overall weakness, heavy legs, and called my Rhuematologist.
he was appalled that I had gone off, and wanted me on 3 mg's immediately, for an unknown period.
instead, I hadCRP, ACE, etc., which showed a small amount of inflammation.
however, that can also come from my Sarcoidosis, or lymphoma.
by the time I saw him, this week, I was much better, almost normal.
he recommended I go on 1 mg. for 6 months.
yesterday, I took 1 mg. pred., as he suggested.
my joints, my neck, my lower legs, began aching, in an hour, I became unstable on my feet, and tired. My legs were heavy, etc.. I felt a kind of malaise settling in.
rheumatologist says that's normal, and it would go away with time.
i think I'my screwing with my body, and upsetting whatever balance it's achieved.
i took 1/2 mg, today, but am afraid of starting again, especially on 1mg, since I haven't had that much for at least 6 weeks.
Is there anyone who has gone off pred in 6 months, and not gotten the PMR back?
Anyone who did get it back, and what did you do, and how long did it take to come back?
anybody with any ideas or suggestions, I appreciate your input.

"I was diagnosed about 4 months ago, but know I must have had this a few years ago. I have a very high pain tolerance and found ways to get through pain. I have had back surgery years ago when I was pretty young. Fusions and lots of nerve pain. Later, had breast cancer and surgeries, then thyroid cancer. But I am strong and strive to do my best. After thyroid surgery 3 years ago, I just never felt well  again.My pain got to the point that I felt like I couldn't go through this anymore... I was in severe pain all the time. Seen many doctors, many diagnoses ,treated for gout,Rheumatoid arthritis and now PMR. I have been told that I probably had Hashimoto's disease before my thyroid cancer as my thyroid was so very small it was so scared and small. Anyway, now although I have no thyroid, I still have hasoriginhimotos but no thyroid , so my auto immune disease  turned to a diagnoses of PMR.

"I am in Mexico and due to adding a week to our trip will be out of my 1mg pred. by this Sunday.  I didn't realize they wouldn't have it here (only 5mgs)
 I will check with a few other farmacias but thought I'd get the advice from our pros before I'm stuck.
I have been on 4mg for a month and even through arthroscopic surgery on my ankle couple of weeks ago and subsequent physio every day after day 5 I have had no symptoms of PMR other than being a bit weepy
I do have some 5mg and I was thinking of cutting them in half and going to 3 1/2 mg using 1/2 of a 5 and one of my 1 mg.   I know this is straying from the very slow reduction plan that has worked so well for me so if anyone has any other options I'd be happy to hear them.
I will be home on Dec. 13th and have pred waiting for me at the pharmacy. They gave me all they had before I left so owe me.  I have lots of 5mg that I carry ""just in case"" and thirteen 1 mg.
Thanks, Diana

"Hello all especially the usual helpful lot. I only seem to come on here when I need advice - sorry!
I have had jaw aching and painful to open wide for 2 days. Just on left side. No headache except I did wake up this morning with both eyes aching around the rims. No other symptoms.
I've just re-watched the Youtube of Prof Dasgupta talking about the symptoms and how one problem is patients themselves not referring themselves in time and how some people don't even recognise jaw pain as a red flag symptom.
The question is, should I get myself to A&E (which seems to me to be over the top ) and start 60mg Pred right away???
I keep thinking that it's probably something simple - but should I be taking action?? I don't want to go blind.
Do you always have systematic symptoms as well like fever?
Many thanks as usual

"I then started with pain in my left shoulder 8 months ago, followed by my neck.  I have been refered to physio, hip specialist and then back to physio.  I have had steroid injections in my hip and shoulder which did not make no difference.  I have seen a rhumatolgist who said because all my bloods are normal and xrays show nothing he couldn't find anything wrong and prescribed pain killers.  I have recently become worse and now my right side seems to be going the same way. My knees have also started hurting on going up or down stairs. My fingers seem swollen in the morning but this gradually goes down. I am seeing a rhumatologist for a second opinion.  I wondered if it was Polymyalgia Rheumatic as I seem to have some of the symptons but not all of them. Is it possible to have this conditionwith normal bloods and xrays. I would love to hear from anybody with any ideas.

Doctor started me on the infusions of Acterma and really spent want me on the prednisone, so I end up hurting so severely, call doctor he puts me on a 3 week prednisone, feel better and start hurting when done with prednisone and it is a merry go round with doctor , so each time I go on prednisone it doesn't seem to work as well. Anyone else going through this? Maybe after a few more infusions I might start feeling better. Pain is severe, in tears with pain and can't walk with it.

"Hi, My blood pressure went up to 175/94 and higher, both last night and this morning, but went back to more or less normal but still fluctuating 2 hours after I took my 2 diuretics and accupril.  I will see my doctor tomorrow but she wants me to reduce pred from 7.5 back to 5, at least till I see her, and take more lasix today.  I also had and still have a headache and increased problems breathing. 
    But I always have problems breathing due to stable but still problematic bird breeders lung disease (from raising pet chickens, geese, etc), so it doesn't worry me that much. (I no longer raise birds- hence the stability).
      I have only been on 7.5 mg pred for about a month and begun on 5 the month before- different from most people.  5 mg helped, but 7.5 mg was really good.  Well, she is a good primary doctor so I will do what she says, but I hope she doesn't keep me on 5mg.  Temporily I don't mind and it does help somewhat.  What would you guys might suggest. Wasn't there something about don't decrease more than 10% at a time?  that would be 6,75mg, not  5 .  But my pills are 5mg.

"I am a soon to be 58 year old male diagnosed with PMR back in June. 20 mg Prednisone was an overnight miracle. Tapered by 2.5 down to 7.5 around Aug but had problems there. Dr.(rheumotoligist) then recommended a slower taper of 1 mg every 2 weeks. (Actually I think I recommended it to her after reading this forum). Started that from 12.5 and got down to 8 last week with few problems. I went to 7mg  two days ago and woke this AM with some solid discomfort. Not full blown but obvious.
Do I try to tough it out through this potential steriod withdrawal or  should I go back up to a no pain level? I am fairly uncomfortable and would hate to get worse.
Should I go back to 8 and hold for 4 weeks plus or up to 9 to knock this down solidly?
I have read many posts here recommending slower tapers below 10 mg but I was doing well and would love to get off this stuff and it's side effects.
Appreciate any thoughts.

"Hello all, I am a 53 year old female and have had PMR like symptoms for the past 7 months. Acute onset and with symptoms many describe on this and other forums.  Joints affected are both shoulders, pelvic girdle, both knees and right wrist.  Arms weak.  (Prior to this I have had right frozen shoulder which began August 2012.  I now believe my left shoulder became frozen in July this year tho it took me a while to realise it was more than the 'PMR').    I have been trying to treat the condition by natural means - acupuncture and chinese medicine which has succeeded in bringing CRP down to normal tho PV remains high at 1.98. Haemoglobin still abit low at 112, globulin raised at 42, albumin slightly low, immunoglobulins IgA 6.8, IgG 17.7.   The new consultant rheumy believes I may have RA and has suggested methotrexte tho I only once gave a weak positive reult for rheumatoid factor.  Recent ultrasound results state I have right wrist synovitis and tenosynovitis, mild left extensor tenosynovitis, acute on chronic tendinopathy of right supraspinatus tendon and bilateral acromioclavicular joint synovitis.   My question is how do I get a positive diagnosis for RA as opposed to PMR?

"Hi, this is all new to me but I am grateful for this forum as I am finding out a wee bit at a time about my condition PMR.  I attended Endocrinology for mysterious weight gain about 10 years ago and a Professor noticed how thin the skin on my arms were.  Anyway lots of tests have been carried out over the years and everything came back normal.  I knew there was something wrong but no one could find out what it was.  I would go once a year just for a review and was discharged in June this year.  My gp (my own gp has extended leave) is referring me back to Endocrinology and when I asked him why he said that I was too young to have PMR, I am a very young 60.  I didn't believe him for one minute and felt very unsettled about this when I got home.  Has anyone else ever been referred to  an Endocronologist?  I have never been on steroids and as I said this is all new to me.  Would be grateful for any information.  Thank you.

"Just had a most enjoyable afternoon at the Surrey PMR Support Group held at the Chertsey Halls and organised by Mrs. O and hard working friends, to celebrate the upcoming Christmas. Excellent buffet, scintilating company, (I won a prize in the raffle, Hurrah! my long suffering wife will love the Milk Tray).  Sadly only 4 men, 3 with PMR and 1 enthusiastic follower, (Husband of the lovely Beryl) the rest ladies. 40 odd attended. My thanks to John and Ewa for putting up with me.
Must say that over 3 years of membership of this support group the information I have gleaned and the help and support  I have received have helped me no end in understanding the condition I have, (PMR) and how to deal with it. Yes, I have made mistakes, two of which have landed me in hospital for a short time. And yes, I have been hospitalised also luckily for short times because of falls but consider myself very lucky to have such good friends and also albeit late to have found this site.
Once again the real reason for this post.

"Hi, I've been reading this for over a year and finally putting my own query forward! I've done the same thing on an Ameriacan site which is also helpful/good: arthritisinsight.com
I'm 51, female, diagnosed last year after fairly classic symptons: unable to lift head off pillow, unable to turn over in bed, thighs and buttocks tender, feelings of flu etc. After various visits and a change in my usual doctor I got sorted with a great GP who then referred me to a rheumy, six days later (brilliant NHS) I was being sorted. Started on 15mg steroids and most of symptons went..... but others came and my GP was obviously considering other things. My worse sympton is the muscles in my throat are affected, giving the feeling of a lump in the throat (I don't have a problem swallowing thank goodness), this has been for the last nine months and is horrible. Also get a burning around the ribs which I think is inflamed blood vessels, had blood in my pee on two occasions, acute pain in chest when I sneeze, had cold hands and feet (mild Raynauds disease).... I have a positive ANA (blood test) and a negative RF. The rheumy took me off steroids after 3 months on 15mg in case they were masking something nasty... loads more blood tests, CT scan and ultrasounds of kidneys.... all ok (ish).
I haven't gone back on the steroids, I manage on 75mg diclofenac a day. My rheumy thinks what I have \""represents\"" polymyalgia, and my GP thinks I have Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease (UCTD). This means I have the symptons of a CT disease, ie lupus/polymyositis/RA but I don't have the diagnostic criteria!
So, is anyone else in this no-man's-land? Is anyone else's throat affected by pmr? My gp hasn't come across this little delight in other pmr patients. I just have to wait and see what develops and in the meantime try and deal with my throat problem and feeling as though I'm seventy. I also am getting my head around wanting it to be PMR rather than waiting for it to develop from uctd to an actual ctd!
I do tons of research (time wasting on the computer!) and find the new national site a real help. Today is good tho!
Best wishes all....

"hello everyone,
i first used this site some 2 weeks ago when after 16 days at 8 mg I believed I was experiencing a bit of a flare up. I went back up to 9 mgs and after 1 day I no longer woke with pain in my neck and after a week all the pain in my hips and upper arms had all but gone. I had my 6 monthly appointment with my rheumatologist and asked if it was possible for me to decrease by 1/2 an mg when I reduce instead of the usual 1 mg most consultants prefer. He was most agreeable and has recommended I try the following programme:
1 month of 9 mg one day followed by 8 mg the next day and continue like that for 1 month, then the following month take 8 mg for the month followed by 8 mgs one day and then 7 mgs the following day for a month and so on. Has anyone else tried this method and if so how successful was this way.
i also asked if I needed to be on alendronic acid and he was happy for me to stop taking it given I'm only 53 and he said that he only prescribs alendronic acid for his very elderly patients and if I'm happy taking calcium, magnesium and vit d supplements then that's ok. I'm felling very happy at the moment and I'm really hoping this reduction programme works

"Hi all,
I've had PMR for almost a year, diagnosed and treated with PRED now for about 3 months.  I'm on Eileen's slow reduction program, going from 15 to 12.5 mg.
Almost immediately after going on the PRED, I started having problems with one of my shoulders, not being able to lift it over my head without some pain.  These past few days, it has gotten rather severe.  I can't even reach out to a toll attendant on a highway to give them the toll.
Looking up the symptoms, it seems like this might be a rotator cuff issue.  So here's the question:
Can PRED make us more susceptable to tendon problems (embrittlement)?  I would have thought that the PRED would have helped any rotator cuff inflammations, but then I remembered that I severed my achilles tendon a few years ago after a podiatrist injected me with a shot of cortisone.  The surgeon said that the cortisone embittled the tendon.
Again, does anyone know of any linkage between prednisone usage and tendon embrittlement?
Thanks all,

GP feels I do not need to do any blood tests really as I had some before strting treatment, just go on how I am feeling. Previously I had normal ESR, but CRP of 18, 23 then 26 at beginning, middle and end of September - he told me it could just be because I had had a cold, he failed to take into account the acute morning stiffness, night pain and inability to walk! I googled my symptoms and found this site so asked to be referred!
Should I have a blood test before I step down, and then how often? I am due back at hospital in March.
Next, as I am only 50, I do not want to take Alendronic acid. The consultant says I need to, as 1 in 3 post menopausal women get osteoporosis. I am a non smoker, drink only in moderation, have a BMI of 24, do not have a family history of fractures, and am not post menopausal, so do not want to take it ""just in case"" as 2 out of 3 women do not! Apparently my hospital prescribes steriods for 2 years and then does a DEXA at the end of the treatment period.
The BSR guidelines for PMR state that bone protection should be started if the patient is over 65, and if under 65 have a DEXA scan. If starting dose of pred is above the standard 15mg, then start AA.
Consultant has refused scan, GP has said if I do not take the AA he will not be responsible if I have a hip fracture, and he is documenting this in my notes. GP will write to consultant requesting scan and hopefully mentioning BSR guidelines.
I have been labelled a stroopy patient!

"I often advise others on the forum that if they are in pain they should up their medication to compensate. I now find myself in a similar position where I am undecided as to what to do.
As per my discussion last week, I had seen my doctor three weeks ago regarding a rash and he advised that he could not do allergy tests whilst I was on such a high dose, so asked me if I was prepared to drop from 21mg to 10mg in two weeks, this I did by dropping 1 or 2mg per day.
During this time although the pain began to increase the rash and itching had reduced (once below 15mg) and I was advised that the rash was almost certainly hives but would be checked out at my next visit, but in the meantime I should up my dose to a suitable level to control the pain that I was now in.
I have been on 15mg since last Tuesday and feel so much better but my legs feel weak and I have very little energy. The worst part is that my shoulders and arms ache quite a bit until the preds kick in 4 to 5 hours later.
Could this be a reaction to dropping down so quickly and am I still suffering withdrawal or should I up my dosage still further. It seems to be getting worse by the day but could probably live with it for a while but would appreciate your opinions.

"Hi all,
I have just decreased my dosage from 12.5 to 10 mg and the nightime and morning pain are quite serious.  The nighttime and morning pain did not appear suddenly after going from 12.5 to 10.  The pain has been slowly increasing ever since I went from 15 to 12.5 mg -- but now it's worse than ever.
I'm on demand this week (working) and am wondering if I should take 5 mg in the AM after breakfast and then another 5 mg in the PM before bed.
What do you think?

"I had gotten down to 9 mg after 9 months of reducing prednisone, but when I went to 8, everything went bust and all my pain came back.  So I went back to 10, but still I am suffering so much pain in arms, legs, ankles, etc. that I can hardly bear it.  Pain eats up my day.  One morning I was so desperate I took an extra 5 mg so I was up to 14, and that day I felt better and could shop.  I went down to 12 for the next two days and I'm hurting.  What is wrong with me?  Is it still PMR?  The doctor hates me to go up above 10, so I haven't mentioned it to him yet, as I'll try to get down to 10 again.  Is it better to feel bad and try to bear it or to sneak a higher dose of pred?

Now 10 months later, after carefully and slowly tapering the dose I am now on 7mg, but, during at least the past 4 or 5 months I have notice my hair thinning all over.

"HI there...as you can see I'm new to the discussions forum. After having aches and pains over the past few months, I've had a blood test to determine inflammation. I'd be interested in any comments re pre-diagnosis: what were you experiencing and how it was dealt with my the medics. I found out about PMR by searching for blood tests for inflammation and the symptoms do tally with mine. In a way I'm hoping something does show up from my blood test because I feel as though I'm not been taken seriously. Thank you.

"Hiya all. I was diagnosed with PMR last May but have changed doctors since then. 2 weeks ago my new doctor advised me to drop my dosage of preds down from 21mg to 10mg within 2 weeks so that he could test me for a skin allergy that had erupted a few weeks earlier when I dropped from 22mg to 21mg. He also advised me that in his opinion I did not have PMR as I also had severe pain in my legs originally and as far as he was concerned PMR did not affect legs. After dropping from 21mg to 15mg the first week I must admit that I did not feel that bad, just a few aches, however half way through week 2 and dropping 1mg a day the pain and aching joints slowly kicked in big time. By Sunday I was almost bed ridden until the remaining 10mg I was still on kicked in.
I saw my doctor yesterday expecting an argument but straight away he backed down, appologised and said that he had misread the notes on screen and accepted that PMR can affect the legs etc. He is allowing me to make the decisions as to pain management and my dosage and has suggested that he thinks the rash and itching is Hives as after I saw him last, he checked up and concluded that my rash was identical to the ones on the web that I had suggested. We are now at peace with eachother and working together and I see him in 4 weeks time. In the meantime I have up'd dosage to 15mg a day and hopefully things can settle down. The moral of this is, we are the ones in pain so do not give in to doctors that try and tell you differently and fight your corner. Good Luck

I had arthoscopic surgery yesterday on my ankle.  Not a big thing just cleaned up a couple of bones that had grown extra bone and was impeding the bending of my ankle.

"Hi am reducing down to 3 1/2 mg of prednisone next week. I was diagnosed with PMR October 2013 started out with 15 mg and now down to 4  I can say not without any pain. I believe that you will have some pain till this PMR goes into remission. What I want to know is what can you take the days that you are experience pain and stiffness ? I will be seeing my doctor on Friday and would like to know what can she give me to help me with the bad days I'm experiencng. I am also a diabetic and prednisone has done havoc on my numbers and that is another reason why I want to get off the Prednisone. Also I am due for my flu shot and I am worried about getting a bad flare. As I know someone who did. This PMR for me all started 10 days after my flu shot last year. I am afraid that I will go back to the beginning of this PMR if I get my flu shot. Has anyone had a flare after receiving their flu shot this year ? Also I never gained any weight while on the higher numbers of prednisone and now that I'm on 4 mg I'm gaining weight and my diabetic numbers are up and down what could cause that ? I think my body is so messed up from being on prednisone for a year. I live in the US and they seem to do things alot differently here where PMR is concerned they went you off prednisone as soon as possible. Need advice.

I have been have lots of pain in my jaw area, and also it hurts to open my mouth wide , but I thought it was TMJ. I get headaches around my temples. If cold air blows on my forehead it gets really bad, like when the car air conditioner blows on my face. My scalp can get very tender, but main thing I notice is my nose cartlidge is very tender the same time my scalp is . Does this sound like GCA? New to all this, but since my dr. doesnt seem to know a lot about it, I live in a rural area and go to a nicenurse practitioner., she did refer me to a GP who gave the PM diagnosis. I had already been put on periodic prednisone for espisodes of muscle pain fatigue, tie up. for many years, the PM thing is a new thing I am learning about, happy to meet all of you,..

"I've been on steroids for two years - and have been under pressure to come off them from the rheumatologist for twelve months. This is not because of the possible side effects per se but because my symptoms have always been 'atypical'. But there are no signs of LORA and negative ANA/ENA panel ( for Lupus?) Having found pseudogout crystals in my knee the rheumatology registrar wondered if it could have been that ""all along"". That, despite the fact that pre-pred I had no swollen, inflamed joints just stiffness and aching in hips  and legs.I didn't get a swollen knee until I was eighteen months in to the medication- raising the more obvious question:could it be related to the pred?
Anyway, I have now transferred to another hospital and am much happier with the care. The rheumatologist there also wants me off pred as soon as is reasonably possible so that they can see what is going on. 
I can see the rationale for coming off pred - it could be masking other problems  - though I do wonder what tests can be done that couldn't have been done before....
Given this reason, should I just battle through and ignore warning signals that  the dose is too low to control inflammation? I have reduced from 5 to 4 over the last six weeks or so - but feel much better on 4.5. At 4 I have really bad lower back ache and deep gluteal pain. If I carry on at this rate I anticipate spending Christmas supine - but in a way it would be worth it if I could get a definite diagnosis. And maybe the back ache is a worrying sign that it is not PMR?

Started 8 mg on the 27th October following excellent blood test result but this time after about 4 days have developed pain in my neck and right shoulder blade (I'm right handed) and now both hips. The pain is completely liveable with but it's still pain that I know is there. What should I do? 1. Have rheumatologist appointment at end of November so should I just hand on till then.
2. Put up with pain - it is nothing more than a mild discomfort and maybe my body will get use to the new level and work its self through.
3. Up my dosage to 9mg again for a while then try and reduce again
i'm 53 and healthy other than the PMR. I also take alendronic acid and omeprazole, but I just want to get off these drugs Asap.

"I have read the problems that people with PMR experience during a pred reduction relapse so I decided to document my experience with GCA.
Since my reduction to 20mg the side effects of GCA after a pred. reduction seems to be a headache behind my left eye and along the left temple. I only reduce 1mg at a time because every time I reduce I end up with the headaches for four or five days. I have found that if I reduce my reading and take my pred in the following manner I survive semi-comfortably. In the AM I take the fill daily dose of pred. and in the PM I take 650mg of aspirin. The PM aspirin allows me to sleep until 6 AM when I start developing a headache.  At that time I take the full dose of pred, put on heavy sunglasses and two hours later my headache almost disappears. Now that I am at 11mg I'll NEVER reduce more than 10% at a time, I NEVER start the next reduction until I do not have a headache but that's just me. I wear heavy sun glasses when driving and any time that I am in the sum.

"I saw an opthalmologist in August, as I was having trouble seeing. Happily it was NOT GCA, but cataracts. He advised surgery in 'about 6 months time.' At that time I was on 10 mg Prednisone. I mentioned that I would not be off the Prednisone at that time and how would Prednisone affect the healing, etc. I also mentioned I would be tapering. (I have successfully tapered to 8 mg at this time). He told me that Prednisone helps reduce inflammation and I would actually be better off on a higher dose. He said that they give steroid eye drops to reduce inflammation. I saw my rheumy yesterday. She advised my continuing with my slow rate of taper. She also told me that the Prenisone slows healing and I should wait to be down to 5 mgs of Prednisone before I have cataract surgery. The earliest that this could happen, at my current rate, would be April or May of next year, as I intend to slow my taper of 1/2 mg per month as I go on lower doses (10% reduction scheme). In the meantime, I am having trouble driving at night (giant halos around the headlights of oncoming cars). Am climbing into the computer to write. Can't see details without squinting. So: wondering two things: Which of the Drs is right? Since I can't taper faster, how fast do cataracts get worse? Thank you in advance. (BTW, I will certainly get other opinions, before I let anyone slice into my eyes).

"Im curious what you have as side effects of prednisone and what you do about it.
For me, I initially loose weight and my skin gets wrinkled from reduction in swelling . But when I start to go off, my appetite goes crazy, I over eat, andalso start to retain fluid..
Solution- I try and notice and not eat as much avoid olives, and salty things especially at night.
When first starting the pred. I cant get to sleep.
After Ive been on it a few weeks, I get delusions of feeling fine.I think I can do things like I used to before I had pain and limitations on my endurance. That also translates in keep me away from my credit card. When I feel so much better I get so many things I want to do, and like Ive been freed from some heavy weights and bondage, but itis an illusion,. I CAN do more than usual on the prednisone, but if I do it I get a big back lash.. Solution, I put signs up on my computer reminding me I am under the influence of prednisone not to trust myself.. think twice before buying anything.
also, my daughter is on the look out and can tell when I might be over doing it. I was a work oholic before and always was physically active,...
Now over doing it just makes me worse and sick.
OH and a big one,,, NEver take prednisone on an empty stomach especially larger doses.. I always split my doses up throughout the day.. I have a much better reaction to them.
also, when coming off prednisone do it REAL SLOW, easier than a relapse. toward the send when Im down to 5mg. I cut a light slice off and gosometimes a week,, and then go down slower.
This much easier to go on bursts than smaller dose for longer periods of time.. even at a lower dose.. its like the body has withdrawels.
take care everyone,

I know a bit about some medical things, but what are the symptoms of osteoporisis ?    I have pain sometimes in my neck, but otherwise I feel fit. I also dance and have been doing this for many years, which is supposed to help your bones as it is weight bearing exercise.

The headache has continued (low grade) above the eyes and yesterday evening my eyes started to feel very sore and stinging. I do have dry eyes which I use stuff for but am starting to feel jittery about the possibility of GCA especially as, at a recent talk by Prof Dasgupta, he stressed the fact that symptoms can be quite slight. I don't have pain in the temples or scalp tenderness or jaw pain but eyes still stinging. Can any of you wise people put my mind at rest?

"Hi all,
I've been on 12.5 mg of prednisone for 6 weeks (15 mg for 6 weeks before that), and it's time to decrease to 10 mg according to all the advice I've read on this forum.
However, in the past few days I'm feeling pretty raw, especially in the mornings and especially in my upper thorax regions.  Painful to even breath deeply.  By noon, the pain is usually gone (at least 75%).  I'd say that my condition has been slowly drifting to this state over the 6 weeks -- not getting better but very slowly worse (especially in the AM).
So here's my question:  should I simply go down to the 10 MG a day, or should I continue at the 12.5 MG?
In general, I don't know how to handle these reductions.  Should I (we) go by the book, or go by the body (feelings)?
Thanks for all your help (all of you).  By far the best such group I've ever joined.

"Wow, only a month ago I could not even use a ""nu-step"" machine for 5 minutes without cramping up. I walked out of the gym that day a very unhappy lady, and that is what inspired me to complain to my cardiologist, the one who came up with the PMR diagnosis.
The nu-step is a recumbent elliptical machine which is very popular with all the physical therapists in this area.  It does both legs and arms while one is sitting down.  Today I lasted a record 40 minutes on the machine- to cheerful Celtic music.  So my question is about ""taking it easy with exercise"".  I did build up to these 40 minutes and nothing is sudden.  But how cautious should we be? 
    My biggest surprise/slight worry is the improvement  in my knees.  3 years ago a top surgeon said he would replace my right knee as soon as I lost 20 pounds!  But I did not lose 20 pounds and still have that bad right knee.  But it is so much better now that I am both on prednisone and exercising that I am amazed.  I may soon be able to walk up steps without a rail to help me up.  I haven't done that in several years. That would be fantastic. Does anyone else have results like this?  (I still have to be extra careful with my shoulders however and exercise them far less.)
     I still don't like the prednisone ""feeling"" and I am really looking forward to getting used to it.  If you remember, I am the one who started on 5mg and have gone up to 7.5mg, which I know is different from most of you.  I can't imagine how you could tolerate a higher dose than that for any length of time.  For most of the last month I have felt unpleasantly wierd.

"I was misdiagnosed in 2013 with exclusively PMR and placed on a low dose of steroids which were quickly reduced so I have been up and down with flares and remissions since. However, I have always had difficulty sleeping but now I am falling asleep, on trains, whilst reading, and am afraid to drive. I sleep for all sorts of times, maybe a few minutes to many hours. I am wondering if this is caused through GCA, has anyone else this problem and any ideas the cause and treatment?

"So letter from rheumy to GP just said assume PMR if good response to steroids. After 12 hours of pred I could bounce up the stairs, the previous night I could not walk up the stairs or undress myself.  A very good response in my opinion. 
After 4 days I did not need any additional painkillers. I do feel very fatigued and have to take care not to do too much, or I just flop.
After 2 weeks on pred I am falling asleep at 2300 and then wide awake by 0200 not dropping off until 0530 then feel dreadful when I have to get up at 7am. I have an afternoon rest. I now have burning down the sides off my thighs. It goes when I have pred. So should I reduce after 3 weeks ie on Tuesday or should I wait a bit.
Any advice on sleeping? 
Thanks for reading this far...

 I have GCA and was diagnosed with it 10/13. In May of this year I relapsed my immediate reaction was to apply warm compresses to the temples, stop reading, drink more water to stop constipation and to go back to 60mg immediately.
I am now down to 12 mg and the Dr. has me reducing 1mg every two weeks from 15mg. In fact, since I started reducing from 25mg I have never reduced more than 1.25mg in a two week period. 
Everytime I have a headache I get worried. The first time these started I resolved the problem by purchasing a new, softer pillow (memory foam). This past two weeks I found that the headache was caused by new glasses so I am now using my pre-GCA glasses.
Are warm compresses on the temples OK and a recommended action?
any other words of advice from the members of this FORUM?

"I've been on 12.5 mg of prednisone now for 6 weeks.  Before that, was at 15 mg for another 6 weeks.  That helped my PMR symptoms wonderfully.  But about 5 weeks ago I developed a severe cough -- I think it was viral.  Lots of mucus, etc., runny nose, itchy eyes, etc.  I ended up with laryngitis.  Ever since, I've been struggling with a tickle in my throat, a very dry cough and borderline hoarseness.
Unfortunately, my job requires me to talk a lot.  I'm a seminar speaker and have been especially busy these last 5 weeks.  In a lot of planes for long periods of time.  I've been drinking lots of water, sucking on a lot of hard candy, taking long and steamy showers -- all to no avail.
I wrote to my doc and he said it'll go away on its own, but it isn't.  Is it time to go to back to the the doc, or are the tickle and hoarseness a potential side effect of taking prendisone?

Is this a special time to take it easy?  Does this go away with time and you awake feeling normal?  My initial response is to lie down.
Prednisone is turning me into a morning person.  I was never ever a morning person, but now I can't sleep.  So I get up for awhile, lie down for awhile (especially when the wushy head strikes), and repeat.

"Hi all. Had my first appointment with rheumatologist yesterday with highly predictable result. He thinks I may not have PMR at all but Fibromyalgia! I explained to him my 'journey' since being diagnosed in January. He said that on 15mgs of Pred, I should not be having any pain at all. He also said that my original response of 50% pain reduction was not dramatic enough to indicate PMR. He has asked me to immediately cut the the Pred to 12.5 per day and then to ten by the end of a month. I told him that I had tried to cut the Pred three times (the last time exceedingly slowly) and had to return to 15mgs every time due to severe pain returning. He told me to ask my doctor for a tablet called Duloxetine to take while I reduce. I have never heard of these. Has anyone been given them and what happened? I will try his suggestion (as, like all of us, I would love to come off of pred) but I am certainly not looking forward to it! At the end of the appointment he asked me what I thought and I told him that I knew what he would say beforehand due to reading lots of accounts on this forum. He looked highly put out and said 'Well at least I,m predictable'!
Also yesterday, I had my appointment with the cardiologist. After another ECG which still shows 'peaked p waves' he told me this is most often caused by lung problems, so another round of tests to go through, starting with a twelve day heart monitor being fitted this Friday, a spirometry test also later this week and then a CT scan over the next couple of weeks. Apparently two possibilities: Pulmonary embolism or COPD. Lovely. What a choice! Anyone else had any of this. Not sure if it is anything to do with the PMR/Pred or if it would have happened anyway. Oh and sorry to harp on but does anyone know if there is a link between eggs and acid reflux? Had the worst attack ever on Sunday morning after eating an egg sandwich, even though i am now on 40mgs of Omeprazole daily. Sorry, a bit long winded but had to get all that off my chest!

"I am an 82 year old male. PMR for 2 1/2 years. Started pred @ 20 mgs. felt so good, was as high as a kite for two weeks then gradually and of course inevitably came back down to Earth. Have learned a lot in those years. Now on 12 1/2 mg. pred and am totally locked into that regime. Have tried over time to reduce the pred by as little as 1/2 mg. per two weeks but never managed to get below 11 1/2 mg. Have tried Methotrexate, Leflunomide (lost 1 1/2 stone over three months) and Mycophenolate to no effect. All these over 3 months each. Now starting on Azathioprine. Side effects of preds included loads of muscle wastage, trouble walking, back ache, loss of balance, both eyes glaucoma, both eyes rapid advance of cataracts, which have now been operated on and new lenses implanted. Gout (Ouch! VERY painful) Atrial fibullation and bad bruising and very thin and fragile skin. Have just started Warfarin, my INR is 1.1 the target is 2.5. Stopped aspirin, maybe this will help the skin being so fragile and the bruising. See a rheumatologist every 3 months, have regular blood tests, last one according to rheumy showed ESR & CRP as 'normal'. I took this as not elevated. Have a blood test chit for Vit D, Vit B12. Take alendronic acid weekly and calcium carbonate with Vit D twice daily, got a little sun this year so Vit D levels should be ok. Was reading somewhere that a Vit B12 deficiency can give symptoms apeing PMR. Anybody know if this is true?
Also and finally does anybody have any new advice to give this wretched old guy as to how to reduce the pred.

"I've been thinkin again.
I've been diagnoised initially with ""undifferentialed inflammatory arthritis,"" and then after sharing some information I received on site with ""PMR.""
My symptoms disappeared almost immediately within 12 hours of taking high doses of prednisone (am now at 12.5 mg/day).  I was told, and have read that such an immediate successful response to prednisone helps confirm the PMR diagnosis.
But is it conclusive?
What other conditions with the same symptoms might respond equally as well to rather high doses of prednisone?
I hope I'm being clear with my question.

"after being on pred for a year now and having many problems as everyone does, I have felt so much better for the last few weeks I have done things I've not been able to do for a long time. 
I was able to do a few hours volunteering at the school I used to work at as a teaching assistant. Much of this made possible by being treated by a lovely Bowen therapist. I had much more energy and had reduced down to 10mg.
i was just thinking about reducing again after a month on that dose when things changed.
I was feeling very emotional, very stressed for no reason and having irrational thoughts. I saw my GP about my prescription and she took my blood pressure which was high. I am now recording it for a week before returning  to see her.
i didn't have high blood pressure before. Has anyone else had a similar problem?

"I live in the US, and my doc originally diagnosed me with ""undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis"" until I did my own research and found that my symptoms seemed more specific to PMR (started in shoulders, went down into my back and legs, happened within days, and responded almost instantly and completely to prednisone).
However, in reading all these posts I do wonder if many of us fall into that broader category of UIA).  I'm wondering if the UK even uses the phrase ""undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis.""
From the literature here in the USA, 40-50% of patients with UIA go into spontaneous remission (sound familiar)?  But 30% of patients with UIA end develop rheumatoid arthritis.  The HIGHLIGHT is that those people with UIA need to be on the constant lookout for rheumatoid arthritis because its treatment goal is to stop its progression.  The sooner a patient knows they're dealing with RA, the sooner they can start treating it.
1.  Does the UK acknowledge the existance of UIA?
2.  Might some of the people on this forum fit into that broader category (maybe even myself)?

"Apologies in advance for the length!
I work at an ice cream parlour, needless to say I do a lot of ice cream scooping and end up doing A LOT of heavy lifting.  About 8 weeks ago my wrist, elbow and shoulder really started hurting. It was a dull ache when not moving and whenever I lifted or twisted my arm it would be a terrible shooting pain.
I found a knot in my wrist which I massaged out and helped with the wrist area. As most of the pain hadn't gone I went to my GP and he gave me Naproxen and CoCodamol. 
I then took and week off and relaxed it, in which time the strain led to both sides of my neck and my glands went up. I had a sports therapist come and massage several other knots out of my back and shoulder blades. Which helped some areas of pain but my elbow persisted. 
I went back to the GP and he then gave me more Naproxen and Tramadol. 
I had another two weeks off doing stretching excercies, light yoga and plenty of baths. I also did hot/cold treatment recommended by the sports therapist. Most of the pain remained in that period if I did not take the Tramodol. 
I feel as though I needed more time off of work but I would not have been able to pay my rent on the sick pay provided by my employer so had to return to work.
I have been back at work for about 5 weeks now and have had mutiple appointments with the sports therapist. I haven't been back to the GP and he did not even touch my arm so I haven't a clue how he knows what's wrong with it. I have however been taking the drugs to help me get through the painbut I do not want to be dependant on them forever and still do not have a diagnosis on what is actually wrong. 
A few things have been suggested as being the problem, RSI, Tennis Elbow and Nerve damage. 
Really what I'd ike, is for someone to be able to assess me properly and to be able to actually tell me what the problem is so I can take measures to fix it. I feel as though it is getting worse again and do not want to cause myself any permanent damage. 
Can anyone thing of a type of specialist I would need to see to help me?

I have asked my Rheumy and he said he didn't think so but I don't have much faith in him to be honest.  I have also been suffering from knee bursitis for a couple of months and I don't know if this is because so the hip problem I have.  I would be grateful if anyone has any comments for me to ponder.
thanks in anticipation

"Hi all
Can anyone offer advice on whether it is worth having the flu jab (and/or the pneumonia jab) when you are suffering from PMR and taking steroids. As PMR affects part of the immune system logically this could effect your immunity to fight the flu from within. I have been offered both jabs by my G.P and having never had either of them before I thought it wise to ask first. Hope someone can assist. Dave

"Hi all, I've been trying to follow the dr's orders to reduce my prednisone.  In Aug. I went from 10 to 9 and after a few days got used to it.  But in Sept when I tried 8, I started having pain flare-ups.  I tried to keep at it to see if I got used to it, but everything got worse and worse.  So in desperation I went back to 10.  Now I've been a week on 10 and the flare up won't subside.  I'm in so much pain in my legs, hips, arms, shoulders.  Could it be something else?  Isn't there anything that helps beside pred.?

"Two weeks ago possibly diagnosed with PMR by my renal consultant.  I have renal failure.  It gave me a glimmer of hope as the pain I have been suffering is excruciating and this has been getting worse over 6 months.  Had MRI on. Ankle only which showed I had been walking about with a broken ankle for months so I have a high pain threshold.  However this pain is different because as well as the symptoms imentioned in the forum I get shooting pains down my thighs like an electric shock and I stumble and let out a yell - severe pain.  How I have not fallen I have no idea.  I was a very active person until 6 weeks ago, swim every morning, yoga twice weekly, tai chi and walking.  This had made my life unbearable.  Put on 20mg prednisolone once daily and find a very little relief-that was 2weeks ago.  See a rheumatologist next wed. so hopefully will get some answers.  I cannot go on.    Does anyone have these shooting pains down the thighs?    Please help

"3 Weeks ago I suffered loss of sight in my righy eye, for around 2 minutes. I saw an emergency Doc at a walk in centre, who straight away thought it was GCA. She consulted with the local Hospital via the phone & another colleague. They decided it was a TIA & NOT GCA. I think they made a presumption about me as I have type 2 Diabetes, stage 4 Renal Failure, High Cholesterol & high Blood pressure. The next day I was sent to Hospital, where I was told I would have a doppler scan of my carotid artery, a CT scan & an ECG. This never happened, I only had an ECG. They said because of my weight, they wouldn't bother as I would be unsuitable for surgery if they found anything, so got sent packing with some information on TIA. I know I still had a sort of stroke in my eye, but no one bothered to give me a blood teat to rules out GCA. I managed to get a Doc's appointment on Thurs, told her my concerns of GCA as I was suffering these awful, distressing headaches. She did a blood test. The results came back yesterday & low & behold my ESR was 97, when in fact should be around 17. My other half had to get to the surgery in half an hour before they shut for the weekend to get me started on 60mg of steroids. (Prednisolone) They said I will get a call early in the week to attand the Rheumotology dept. This took 3 weeks to eventually diagnose GCA, with my perserverence, which I think is disgusting. I am already very overweight & am worried about weight gain with the steroids. Can anyone tell me what to expect taking these please & how long before these awful headaches will abate? Many Thanks x

Lately though I'm pretty sure they have grown and I have very sharp, nerve like pain in my right and and I have also noticed one on the corner of my foot. ( like the bottom knucklebit of your big toe but on the side.) that's also hard and feels like bone. Iv the same very sharp pain from that to.

"I am to reduce Prednisone from 9 mg to 8/9/8/9 starting tomorrow and am wondering whether this is a good idea at this time. (My rheumy had wanted me to drop from 10/9/10 9 down to 8 and then after two weeks to 7.) I balked at that and she agreed to 10/9/10/9 for several weeks to 9 and then 9/8/9, etc. ). My last SED rate, a month ago, was normal and am feeling quite well. The reason I am balking, is that a difficult work situation over which I have no control and which cannot be changed, has left me in a lot of stress, so that I am not sleeping. I wake up at 1:30 am after 3-4 hours and cannot get back to sleep. I start work at 8, work full time and have a very full life, otherwise. So, should I wait until I have mentally and emotionally  adjusted to the new situation at work before I reduce the Prednisone? (Hoping I can get my hed around it fast: trying yoga and other stuff to calm down the spinning thoughts in my head).

After weeks of agony and dozens of tests.It was bliss as within 3 days all the stiffness and pain sup sided. I have been on 15 mg now for 2 month and would have been on that under his direction for some more month to come.

"I have written before under Newly Diagnosed. Something puzzles me about all this. I have suffered for a really lot of years with arthiritis, particullarly my back and hands. I was diagnosed a few weeks ago with PMR and am on 15mg of Pred. It was like a miracle, all my pain dissappeared. Now after a month my pain has returned with a vengence.
Dr wants to put me on a tab for osteoporosis, which I am not too keen about, would much prefer to have a Calcium supplement, and to have proper scans to see what I am dealing with. I dont doubt for one minute that it is PMR, as I have a lot of the symptoms, night sweats, aches and pains etc: (which I have had for years), night cramps, swollen ankles etc:
I am getting away from the title here, is it at all possible to have had it and not known about it? Over the years I have had physio, cortisone Injections, and acupuncture for the pain. Myself I feel yes I have PMR, but could I be dealing with something else as well?
Your feedback will be appreciated.

"Hi everyone, I have been diagnosed for approx 7 weeks, and am on 15mg of Predisinole. Originally I went to my GP for my arthritis which had got quite unbearable, particullarly in my lower back and hands, prior to this I had started to get pains in my upper arms and shoulders. Hence my GP's investigations and diagnosis of PMR. The first few weeks were like magic, all my aches and pains dissappeared, I was cut down to 12.5mg, but had to go back to 15mg, as I was getting twinges again. Now I am back with my original back pain, which I think needs investigating. (What does anyone else out there think?). I have no doubt that I have got PMR, I have terrific night sweats which are awful. From what I have read about this it doesn't seem very good. My GP is wanting to put me on a tablet for Osteoperosis, but having read all the info on this, the side effects are putting me off. Really could do with advice and feedback please.

"Hi
I have had bad shoulder and neck pain and stiffness since the beginning of July. I took ibuprofen for two weeks as this has worked before for me and then rang GP as I felt I needed Physio. ( I had meningitis when I was 28 and physio helped lots and since have had lots of neck injuries which physio have fixed.)
The receptionist said there were no appointments and to ring the next day. I was in so much pain and could not turn my head to see out of the drive when I needed to drive to work, I felt needed to do something, so rang Physio, said I could self fund and was seen the next day.
My neck and shoulders were solid. I had very limited movement. I had physio 2 a week and my neck felt better BUT then I got really bad pain  in my hips and thighs. I had difficulty walking, was very stiff in the mornings but better by lunchtime. I have really bad hip and thigh pain at night and wake with the pain. By end August physio was worried. 
The physio checked me for MS as my mother was really worried by my walking. I went to the GP who said he thought my walking was fine and did not know what was wrong with me. He asked me direct what did I think was wrong with me ! I did not know apart from I am in so much pain some days I cannot get out of bed or in the bath or get dressed!
He did some blood tests and they came back as a high C Reactive Potein. The normal is 1.5 to 5 and mine is 18. He said that we need to do the test again and then he would refer to rheumy if still high. 
An hour later he asked me to return to see him as he thought he ought to examine me for Guillane Barre syndrome and kept asking me about my breathing. I have a friend with GBS so know about it. Friend went into hospital 6 months ago and is still there! GP decided to ring on call neurologist who said do an urgent referral and I should be seen in 2 weeks. 
So I have sat at home and panicked! I have checked Internet for Guillane Barre and my symptoms do not fit.
I found PMR and it fits. Should I be bold and ask to see rheumy and ask for pred? Or should I see neurologist and wait and see?
My pain and stiffness are so bad I cannot do so many things. I have good days and bad days. 
I am female and 50. 
Apologies for a very long post. Thank you in advance. Forum is wonderful. Jane

"Hi all
I was diagnosed in january 2014 with sudden onset PMR. I am a 57 year old female who up until sudden onset was a fit and healthy person. I woke up one morning and the pain was everywhere, couldn't move to get out of bed and it was very scary. I started off on 5mg prednisone which did nothing. GP upped it to 20mg and the pain lessened. At least I could raise my arms. The GP I went to said I had to come off prednisone quickly but everytime I got to 10mg the pain became intolerable. So went back to GP and am staying on 15mg for the next few weeks then downing the dose by 1mg a week.. Over the last couple of weeks the pain in my hands and arms has been really really bad to the point it brings me to tears. I have not been without pain since january, sometimes a dull ache but other times full blown pain!!! I have found this forum so helpful in understanding that PMR affects people differntley. I have made appt to go back to GP next week with the hope of referral to a Rheumatologist to see if there is more going on. I sympathise with everyone who has PMR as it is not easy to live with and it can get you down. I find after having an active day the next day I suffer for it but am learning to work through it. Thanks to those who commented on homeopathic remedies, was very helpful. I have a full massage once every three wekks and have found this really helpful. Also having a sleeping tablet once every three days as least aloowed me 2 good nights sleep a week. So thanks to all I really appreciate this forum.

"Hi Everybody, I posted some weeks ago to know if anyone had any experience of Acupuncture helping PMR. I seemed to have been told by so many people \""Oh you must try acupuncture\"", so I did and have been 4 times now. So for anyone thinking about it here are a few do's and don'ts.
Make sure you go to someone reputable, the British Acupuncture Council seems to be the major British supervisory body.
Be clear what you want. I tried an alternative health clinic first.When I phoned asking whether acupuncture helped PMR, the receptionist said that I would be offered a free 15 minute appt. with the Clinic's Director. Nice women, but she then said I should first try \""bio-energy healing\"", later maybe acupuncture. It's very hard to get yourself out of these situations! So I paid her £50 to have her wave her arms about (no actual physical contact). I later realised that she was a business woman who basically let rooms in her premises to other therapists and it was actually in her interests to see patients herself. Also I felt very wary about seeing anyone who might steer me towards Chinese medicine as there had been some pretty adverse criticism in the press about this. Do realise that it is quite hard to resist when someone tells you that you need something!
So I found someone I was happy with, working in the local physiotherapy clinic. Very gentle, not pushy. We would see how I felt after 3 or 4 sessions. I had had PMR for sometime and it was systemic so not likely to have an instantaneous healing. I said I wanted it to help with the side effects of steroids, and reducing the dosage, and maybe any particular pain. The last it very clearly has helped. When I have been with specific pain, one week with knees, another with neck and shoulder, it did help. Otherwise it was rather non-specific. I tended to feel better in myself in a rather vague way. Perhaps it was the attention! But one week I was going on to lunch, looking round a cathedral, and also viewing a large exhibition of about 50 paintings. This last I was dreading - the walking round slowly and standing are almost my worst activities! But I felt fine! Anyway, it is now left that I might like to go back monthly or for any specific pain. I certainly didn't feel he was after my money! I did go trying to feel open minded about it. If anyone wants to know anymore just ask.
Have a good day everybody. Green granny

"Hi all,
I've posted here before and get so much from this group -- learning so much.  I have PMR, and am currently at 12.5 MG of prednisone and all is as good as can be expected -- under control at least.
However, I am a seminar speaker and have contracted a nasty cough on Friday.  I'm ""on again"" tomorrow for another 4 days.  I'm ""iffy"" at best.
I do know that most bronchial and throat conditions are viral, and therefore not treatable with antibiotics.  I don't think my condition has gone into my lungs -- mainly my throat and bronchial tube.
Here's my question:  I think I remember reading that there are some conditions we have to be careful about when taking prednisone, and perhaps lung conditions are one of them.  What symptoms should I look for to alert me its time to go to a doctor?  
PS:  I am out of town now, in a place where I am not familar, so it would be hard to find a place to go, although I would if I thought I needed attention.

"Much to my dismay I have noticed that the prescribed prednisone dosage of 15 m for 1 week and then lower to 10 mg by my Primary Care doctor did not take care of my shoulder and lower back pain.  I needed to go up to 15 and even 20 mg to be painfree,  always worrying that the steriods would do harm to my health in general.  I was also diagnosed with RA a few years ago when 5 mg Prednisone would be enough to take care of flares.  
The PMR diagnosis was a total surprise because I was in such pain with especially my right and then my left shoulder.  Any repetitive movement would cause a problem.  I had to quit my exercise class which I liked.  Dreadful! 
I happen to read the informative Patient UK article about SELF-ADJUSTING STEROID DOSE WITH PMR which helped to explain to not lower suddenly....not more than 1 mg for a length of time.
I am still in the informative stage as this is new to me, and I can still hardly believe that this is happening to me.  I had never heard of Polymyaglia Rheumatica before.
It looks like that only this UK Medical Website is informative.  I live in  USA.......
It feels good to talk/write about it......one does not feel quite so alone with this problem if one can share it with others who understand and suffer the same.
Right now my left arm is hurting.....and I need to stop typing.
I feel I have a long road ahead with PMR......
Thank you for your input and caring.

"Cut and pasted from: http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/news/general-news/2014/september/uk-study-shows-new-method-of-switching-off-autoimmune-diseases.aspx
UK study shows new method of 'switching off' autoimmune diseases Published on 08 September 2014
A new UK study has shed light on a possible new method of 'switching off' the cellular process that drives the progression of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and arthritis.
University of Bristol researchers have devised a new technique for stopping autoimmune cells from attacking healthy body tissue, reversing the process and ensuring the immune system goes back to its intended function of protecting against disease.
Published in the medical journal Nature Communications, the study showed how administration of fragments of the proteins that are normally the target for attack can help to correct the autoimmune response. Effective treatment was achieved by gradually increasing the dose of antigenic fragment injected.
The team was also able to find changes in gene expression that help explain how effective treatment leads to the conversion of aggressor cells into protectors. This makes it possible to help the immune system ignore its own tissues, while remaining capable of protecting against infection.
It is thought that this new technique can offer a number of advantages, as it specifically targets the cells at fault, rather than inhibiting the immune system as a whole using immunosuppressive drugs. This current technique can lead to harmful side effects such as infections, tumours and the disruption of natural regulatory mechanisms.
Study leader Professor David Wraith said: ""Insight into the molecular basis of antigen-specific immunotherapy opens up exciting new opportunities to enhance the selectivity of the approach, while providing valuable markers with which to measure effective treatment.
""These findings have important implications for the many patients suffering from autoimmune conditions that are currently difficult to treat.""
A spokesman for Arthritis Research UK said the research by the Bristol team was promising.
""Finding new and better ways of targeting treatment for autoimmune conditions is a focus of much of our and others' research focus,"" she added.

"Hi all. It's been a week or so since I posted as I had a bit of a shock last time I visited the hospital. I went for a routine pre-op check and when they checked my pulse were surprized how fast it was. I explained about the steroids but they decided to do an immediate ecg. This was ' very abnormal' so they repeated it. Still the same. Apparently I have very high 'P' waves. Next day I received calls from the hospital to say that my op had been cancelled and that they were contacting my gp to recommend urgent further investigations. Five mins later I got a call from the gp asking me to go in and see them. They wanted me to have a 24hr egc monitor (having this fitted tomorrow) an echogram and various blood tests (done last thursday). My gp has referred me to the 'rapid response chest pain unit' to see a cardiologist. (So rapid that I haven't heard from them yet and the referral was 10 days ago)! Apparently a lot of the symptoms which I have been assuming were side effects of the pred, are the same as symtoms of heart problems. E.G: Breathlessness,pain that progresses from chest to face (gp diagnosed acid reflux and prescribed omeprazole), swollen ankles/feet, occasional palpitations (doesn't every woman of my age get these)? and dizziness/nausea. I must admit their initial reaction freaked me out somewhat but since my visit to the surgery everything has slowed to the usual nhs pace so presumably things are not as bad as I first feared! Anyway I would love some feedback from anyone who has been through this. I have done some research and found that high P waves can be a sign of low potassium levels (often found in people on 'loop diuretics' which I take to relieve the swollen ankles/feet). Hopefully this is the problem. A lot less scary than heart failure!

My question is am I having a flare and therefore should I increase steroids

"My mum has had PMR for some years now. Been up and down on pred. Her arms are covered in blood blisters and her skin is so thin. She is 79 this year but has always had good skin. Is this a side effect of pred as my son took it for asthma and never had these awful blisters.

"I am trying to pick up the thread of a previous entry...regarding a terrible rash, extremely itchy...on my back mostly...some spots on my upper arms, chest, stomach and inner thighs. On a totally different forum people that were prescribed prednisone developed this rash when they tried to get off the prednisone. I am now wondering if going from 10 mg daily of prednisone, for the PMR, to 9 mg for one month...then 8...could be causing the rash? I am familiar with the fatigue and ""under water"" feeling for the first week of a taper....but am I tapering too quickly, thus the rash? Thank you for any advice.

"I have had PMR for exactly two years (yay happy anniversary to me) and on steroids for 22 months. For the first six months I was happily taking the steroids with yogurt and experiencing no gastric problems but then the rheumatology registrar persuaded me, against my better judgement, to take Omeprazole. ""When you drop dead from internal bleeding, the coroner will want to know why I didn't prescribe it"" were his exact words...
I was down to 5mg steroid at the beginning of the year and dropped to 4mg in May (again against my better judgement as the consultant told me to do alternate days rather than the much more gradual tapering that most of us now do, thanks to Eileen and Mrs O). I had had a swollen knee for about six months (""knees are not involved in PMR"" was all I got from the consultant - you are probably spotting a theme here...)but it got much worse after the drop in steroids and then my calf swelled up and my heel which had been painful became numb - and still is. 
Anyway, to cut a long story short, the registrar finally aspirated my knee and found gout crystals in the fluid. I am about as far from a typical gout sufferer as you could imagine - and I have been on a low purine diet since my husband developed it five years ago - so I found this odd to say the least. And then I suddenly wondered whether the Omeprazole might have caused it. There have been a couple of papers written on the link between Omeprazole and acute gout attacks, so it has obviously happened to other people.
So I am stopping taking the Omeprazole - which I think I should never have been on anyway as I have borderline osteoporosis in my spine and it impedes absorption of calcium - to see if it is has any effect. My question is, should I be tapering off the Omeprazole? My doctor gave me 10 mg instead of 20mg capsules which I took for a week and then I opened the capsules and removed half the dose for 2 days, but yesterday took nothing and had my first ever experience of indigestion.... Nothing that I can't put up with though. Just wondered if anyone who has been through similar has any advice.
Oh and guess what - the registrar is now saying maybe it was gout all along which is ridiculous. I have witnessed gout attacks and know how agonising they are. The first three months pre-steroids, were all about muscle pain/stiffness, tiredness, loss of appetite - not a hot swollen joint in sight!
Sorry this is such a long, rambling post....

"My GP put me on 60mg Prednisilone when I went to see him about a temporal headache which had developped over about 6 to 8 weeks.
NO OTHER SYMPTOMS but the steroids took the pain away and made me feel rather unwell. PV blood was normal. I then saw a rhumatologist, he is not convinced that it is GCA but wants a biopsy (organised for 2 weeks time.) He took me off the steroids and the pain is back. It is not a very bad pain but it is there most of the time. I am wondering if anyone out there has had the same sort of symptoms and were then diagnosed with GCA?. I feel it could all be a bit of a storm in a tea cup but on the other hand I don't relish the idea of loosing my sight and feel I have to proceed with the biopsy. I am 60 by the way!

"Hello,  I wonder if anyone could give me some advise please?
I  have been taking Prednisolone 50mg since May and have really slowly got down to 20mg.  Feel fine accept I have lumps come up either side of my face just between the cheek bone and temple bone.
The lumps seem quite hard and throbbing.
I went to my GP about a month ago and she said that it was nothing.
(she really didn't have a clue)!  What I was thinking that it could be a allergic reaction to one of the other no active ingredigents in Prednisolone. Can this happen and has anyone else had this problem?

"I've had sudden shoulder, then middle back, then lower back and leg pain since March, 2014 (debilitating within 3 weeks).  Doctors did extensive blood work and MRI's to rule out anything else, and then determined that I had ""undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis.""  When I suggested to the doctor that it might be polymyalgia rheumatica, he said ""yes it could be, although it's presenting itself a bit differently."" 
I was in a lot of pain from my neck to my legs -- I couldn't get dressed alone.  Doctors put me on prednisone and within 12 hours the pain was gone.  60 mg/day at first, then tapering down to 8.5. 
At 8,5 the pain came back and now I'm up to 15 mg a day again.
Here's my concern:  when the pain came back it was mainly in my ribcage area -- the stermum, and the backbone behind the sternum. I see stars when I sneeze.  I feel confident it's muscle or tendon related because it only hurts when I move -- not when I'm still.   Shoulders hurt a bit also, but mainly thoratic region of the spine.  With all that I've read, PMA does not apprear in this region.
Even though they've tested me, could something else be going on or can PMA affect the thoratic region of the spine as well as shoulders and hip?
Thanks.  This looks like a great support group.

"I was diagnosed with PMR one year ago.  It started with Pain and severe stiffness in both shoulders.  My knee was very painful and stiff as well.  I had low grade fevers in the evening, weight loss, i felt so down and i had an elevated ESR (96) and CRP.  I couldn't dress, shower or even brush my own hair, I counldn't squeeze the toothpaste or get in or out of bed without help. I also developed pain and stiffness in my hands, mostly around the thumb area. I was finally started on Prednisone 10, which after a week did not help so was increased to 15mgs.  I am now on my 3rd Rheumatologist who started to wean me off the pred.  I am down to 4mgs 6 times a week and 5mgs once.  I tried to go to 4 mgs daily and the pain in my hands increased and now I have developed stiffness and pain in my thighs and hips.  My doctor doesn't think i have PMR, she says I am too young 53, 54 in two weeks.  She first said Psoriatic Arthritis and now just says inflammatory arthritis.  Both ANA and RH factor are negative.  I am so convinced that it is PMR and I don't want to start on arthitis meds.  I reas the posts here and have heard so many of you sya you are experiencing the same symptoms.  I am so depressed right now, I do not know what to do about treatment.  I am suppose to start Supartz for my left knee, 5 injections in 5 weeks, my ortho doc says that is a separate issue.  He says I have OA.  I have had surgery in the past so I know he is right.  Any suggestions, thoughts or ideas are welcome.  I am tired of taking pred with the side effects especially the weight gain (35) pounds.  I am thinking of going to yet another rheumatologist for another opinion.  Thanks!

My rheumatologist says it is inflammation of the cartilage.  It seems much better if I do not drink coffee.  (I miss my little cup of java.)  Orange juice and tomatoes also seem to cause inflammation.  Anyone got any thoughts?

"I have been struggling with PMR since this March, and have only been on prednisone for about 3 months.  Awful pain and agony before then.  Now it's not too bad.  Started at 60 MG, weaned down to 8 MG over the 3 months, but now I'm back up to 15 MG.
Prior to going on prednizone, the docs told me I should exercise as much as the pain allowed, but it hurt too much to allow hardly anything.  I used to walk, strenuosly, about 3 miles a day before exeperiencing the pain in March.
Now, with the prednisone helping with the pain, I started walking strenuously again.  I was actually down to 8 MG when I started walking and the PMR flared almost immediately.  
Here's the question:
I don't know if the flare was because of the decrease (from 60 MG to 8 MG) too fast -- over a period of 3 months -- or because I started walking again.
Last week, feeling iffy but not too bad, I did a 3 mile strenuous walk at 10 MG and the very next day felt awful.  Felt awful the day after as well. Finally went back up to 15 MG and now I'm okay again.
Can exercise hurt me -- actually causing a flareup?

"So first bout of PMR 7 yesrs ago and now flare up after finally reaching 1.5mg pred - so  here we go again ( CRP 145).  Amazing result from uping pred dose - no pain - just normal striffness+ moving discomfort/pain -first in shoulders,then legs,next neck!! + slowness + low mood + fatigue.
People give such good descriptions of their experineces of PMR on this forum and we all benefit from their questions and the relies so many of you give.
Despite being an old hand at this, what I  would really love to know is what PMR is.  If we talk about Flu I can visualise a virus invading the baody and causing havoc ( that little green gremlin that spreads around the body raising tempreatures etc until the white knight of the body defences surround him and kick him out!!- obviousy watched too much  animated TV whilst recovering from PMR!).  What I can't visualise is how PMR affects us - I know it is an autoimmune disease that for some reason releases cytokines which cause inflammation in the muscles.  Eileen's description of climbing stairs with PMR equates to the effort of climbing a mountain, describes how i feel - but why?  I'm not in acute pain now, my muscles work, my brain works (i think) so why can't I move easier - WHY can;t I walk faster - all my movements seem slow and thought about.
My other bg question is the motivation/mood changes.  I change daily, some days being tearful, other days I get out of bed with ideas that I can do things only to find myself still sitting st the breakfast table an hour later. I can;t even do my craft work which normally i'd give anything to have the time to do.
In my pre retirement a lot of my job was spent discussing achievable targets for people so I know how to pace myself - the problem I have is getting going.  Is this lack of motivation the effect of PMR or the steroids.?
Just had a thought perhaps we should have a FAQ page attached to this forum - then poor Eileen , Mrs O etc wouldn't have to keep repeating themselves thousands of times for all the questions we ask!!  Thanks for all your research and replies - you all keep us informed - we in turn do our best to distribute the information to those in the NHS who are interested but just too pressurised to research everything as thorougly as they would wish.  
The old format of this forum when you could run down a list of the titles of the disucssion threads  used to make it easier to review topics that were pertinent to ones questions.  I haven;t quite got used to this forum layout yet - give me time!!

"Hello all
Beev here - sorry I haven't been on here in absolutely ages. Completely immersed in family problems I'm afraid since I retired! Golden retriever also takes up an enormous amount of time.
I am currently on 2.5mg alternate days (i.e. 1.25 a day). For those of you who remember me, I can't take the uncoated 1mg because of stomach issues. I have been on this dose for many months now and don't seem to be able to get my ESR below 20. In the past, I have waited for it to be mid teens before taking a drop but am tempted to just have a go anyway.
I also recently attended a talk by Prof Dasgupta, during which he said that steroid injections can help when people are finding it difficult to reduce. My GP says she knows nothing about this so we are considering a referral to the great man himself.
Any suggestions on this please? I'm sure Eileen will have the answer if she sees this.
Thanks in advance for your help

"Can anyone who has been through the whole PMR journey tell me how they would describe how they feel/know that the PMR has gone and the pain left is just withdrawal from prednisone as the body adjusts.  I was wondering about muscle strength and if that is an indicator ( I have practically none and even lifting a 2 litre milk bottle seems a chore) Also I noticed you mentioned fatigue - is that PMR or a prednisone side effect?  I certainly have that if I do the least little thing.  I am down to 9mg and the pain isn't too bad - little niggly bits here and there.  It seems we can't rely on the blood tests ESR & CRP as I've read other have normal tests but still have PMR - Are there any other indicators one way or another as I don't want to do any more reductions if the underlying syndrome is still there, however I do want to get off prednisone as soon as I can if the PMR is no longer the issue if you can understand my ramblings.

"Diagnosed with PMR in early May and been on 20 mg/day prednisone since then except for an attempted reduction to 10 mg which lasted a day after being recommended by my GP. Since June seeing a rheumatologist who since July also had me taking 15 mg/day of meloxicam.  in August she recommended i reduce the prednsione to 17.5 mg and stay on the meloxicam.  When i complained about the meloxicam causing stomach issues she agreed for me to reduce that to 7.5/day.   Since I have tried this reduction for nearly 30 days i am very concerned about any further reduction due to the following:
*my morning pain and stiffness has not improved and has actually worsened some days particularly in shoulders/neck.
*my level of energy has decreased with fatigue a constant problem; i am still working but finding fatigue to be a constant battle and days off are total rest days usually amounting to major naps.  i think as an aside that fatigue is a neglected symptom of pmr not talked enough about in websites describing symtoms. Also related to that is ""brain fog"" which is also a neglected symtom in my opinion and something i deal with many days.
*continued with meloxicam until the 20th when after several more bouts with stomach issues = cramping, diarrhea,  came home from with upper stomach chest cramps that had me bent over..decided that night to stop meloxicam and stomach issues have abated for most part.
*now the last few nights I have  been having severe ear pain when sleeping- ear feels blocked but then when i touch it and try to ""relieve pressure"" i get a stabbing pain that never felt before that continues....this may be unrelated to everything else such as pmr and prednsione but something i am concerned about ..because of that took a meloxicam last night at bed...made an appt this am back to my GP to check on ears which feel blocked with a mild pulsing sensation ..anyone have problems like this?.
Apologize for getting into all this background of issues but very concerned with any thought of now reducing prednsione to 15  mg/day  with way i have been feeling etc.  Think I am going to just email or call rheumatologist and say i want to stay at 17.5 for a while as i am not sure i should not be at 20 mg anyway.  Not scheduled to see rheumatologist until October.  Also not sure about the need for meloxicam and whether it is any help but with this ear pain thought i might as well try it.

"I've posted before so will do the very potted history . . . .
It's now two years since first diagnosed with Polymyalgia Rheumatica and the first Prednisolone which was like a miracle and I guess still would be if I 'overdosed'. Currently well stuck at 10mg there seems no way forward. I've tried the slow tapper but the first day I drop there is a reaction so I had decided to just take a quiet view and stick at 10mg until the new year and then try the slow taper again.
I'm not uncomfortable at this level and it does not worry me to stay at this level.
But, the Hospital called today as there was a cancelation and I was overdue to see the Consultant. Chatted over my position and he expressed concern that I had become steroid dependant, something that can happen after two years. Whilst the dependency was not something that concerned him in itself it did however at the 10mg level. Get to 5mg 'ish and that would be more acceptable.
So he wants me to go on Methotrexate, starting with a three month course running alongside the 10mg of Prednisolone. This is to be closely monitored by a 'specialist' under one if the consultants (can't remember for what) and will mean blood test one or twice a week. Then after another Rhumi appointment in three months a decision will be made to start lowering the Prednisolone.
The whole thing seems horrific, especially as I have just noticed in an article on this site the following 'There is little evidence for the efficacy of steroid-sparing agents - eg, methotrexate or anti-tumour necrosis factor agents. Methotrexate is the most commonly used corticosteroid sparing agent.'
Any comments and thoughts will be appreciated.

"Hello everyone, it's been a while since I posted on here. Just feeling really down at the moment with various symptoms of pmr, it just seems never ending. Was diagnosed with pmr I'm March 2011 after spending a week in hospital. When I came out of hospital having been put on 40mg of prednisalone. They then diagnosed me with steroid induced diabetes (type2) since then I have been up and down with the dosage of pred and am now back on 15mg. My rheumatologist said I was looking very cushion good and believe me my face felt swollen and the skin tight. My rheum said that this comes from being on steroids foe a long time so he put me on Azathriaprine, this is to finally get me off the steroids. Over the last 6-8 weeks I have been suffering from trochanter bursitis and the pain is getting increasingly worse. I've also recently been diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis, (I know!!!!) So as you can see I'm a bit down with it all and wonder where it's all going to get better. I am only 57 but feel 87!!!. Sorry to go on guys but it helps to let it out.

"I have recently been diagnosed with PMR, at age 57 - symptoms - huge weight loss, night sweats, stiffness/pain in morning, excessive wee-ing (is that last one usual by the way, no one else seems to mention it). My pain/stiffness is mostly in the lower half of
the body - shoulders so far unaffected, touch wood...
I tried the 5 day diagnostic test of 15mg prednisolone, and it certainly alleviated the symptoms a lot and, while keeping an open mind, I am hoping not to have to take steroids. What I dont understand is that if tapering the dose is to allow your adrenals to get up to speed, won't they do that better without steroids in the first place?Just with a lot of rest, gentle exercise and ..... well, time? Is there any medical evidence as to whether people go in to remission quicker with or without steroids?
I know ibuprofen has its problems too, but if I have a reasonably high pain threshold and can manage with just, say, one 400mg dose a day - will I be prolonging the disease in some way by not taking steroids?
I have been managing OK for the last week on this regime. Yesterday, however, I thought I'd see how I did without any painkillers and this morning the stiffness was so bad that I couldn't put my socks on. I put this down to not having the ibuprofen yesterday, but then I had also eaten macaroni cheese for lunch which is full of inflammatory stuff, if we are to believe what we read on the net.... so who knows?
A few more days like today and I'd be on steroids like a shot - but only if I can really understand and weigh up the benefits.... When I made the decision not to go on steroids, I have to say I felt psychologically so much better, just because it felt like I was taking control after weeks of misery.
I would be so grateful for your comments.

"I have had PMR for 3 months been on pred 15mg down to 12.5mg and just recently have dropped to 11mg - I went for the blood tests yesterday and they came back well within normal range so the Dr said the PMR has gone and I can now start slowly reducing the pred.  I know you have said to stay on the 10mg for a year - would this still apply OR do I reduce as low as I can and see how the pain reacts and go back up a bit if it returns as the Dr suggests.  Hearing that the blood levels can be deceptive has made me a bit anxious and unsure.  You probably know what its like I want to reduce as low as possible but I want to do the best for the long term outcome also..

"I am on my third lowered dose day - ie have got to the stage of five days old dose (5mg) one day 4mg and am already feeling the shoulder pain come back which I haven't had for a few months. 
Should you expect to feel a return of symptoms so early on in the slow reduction scheme? It's not debilitating by any means but I wonder if it's a bad sign and means I should go back to 5 mg which was a sticking point previously?
Meanwhile I have been looking in to hyperbaric oxygen chambers - ha! I can just imagine how my rheumatologist would react to that one!!....

"Hi all
Just wondering if anybody can help. For a while now (started pre-pred) I have been making weird noises in my sleep. It is not normal snoring but appears to come from my throat. It does not make much difference which position I sleep in (even sitting up). My partner says it is like sleeping with someone playing the trumpet.... badly! The thing is, my throat has felt increasingly strange (very dry, horrid taste, slightly swollen) since the pmr and It has just occurred to me to wonder if there is some connection? I have tried a few things such as, ice cold water, hot tea, no drink, nose clip...all to no avail. Any serious suggestions would be extremely welcome.

"I was diagnosised with PMR four months ago and was put on steroids which tamed down the symptoms within the typical 48-72 hours. I'm  slowly trying to go down in the doseage. Labs are now normal but I still have symptoms, not even close to as bad as prior to medication but still there. Do any of you still have mild symptoms with normal labs, is that possible? 
The reason I am confused is that I had symptoms for several months before they ramped up to the point I was  in terrible pain and had trouble getting out of bed or out of a chair etc, the normal symptoms most seem to report. At my worst and only until then did my labs register as high and only then was the diagnosis made. My doctor is telling me that if I am having pain with normal labs then it must be the osteoarthritis and not the PMR. My simple question is, do any of you have breakthrough mild to moderate symptoms needingOTC pain medication while still pulling normal labs?

"Hi, I just wonder whether you can still have low esr results and have GCA? I am still awaiting a proper diagnosis. The orthpaedic surgeon I have been seeing has suggested to my gp that I may have PMR or RA. I have the symptoms of PMR and she allowed me preds for one week only. I felt wonderful! I was able to walk well, which I havent done for about two years now. I was getting out of bed and not having to hold onto things. I was getting sleep without being woken with severe hip pain! I went back and asked gpfor some more, excited cos they worked and I was thinking I could go back to work. She said no, not till I have seen the rheumy, as my esr levels were low. I have been told that they still can be low with PMR and the ortho spesh agreed and has written a report now to my gp suggesting I may have this, so I am hoping she will change her mind and represcribe before my rheumy appt next month. The reason I am worrying is that my jaw has been aching for the last week or so and I think I read that this is a symptom of GCA and I am scared of the implications of this without the right treatment.

"Hi, About 5 weeks ago I noticed I was running a temperature from time to time. Told me GP,he got me to keep a temperature chart for a week and took bloods. Bloods showedf inflammation, the following week I showed him my temperature chart and he got me a chest x-ray and took more bloods. X-ray clear, blood still showed inflammationbut it had reduced. GP spoke to consultant who felt things had peaked but to refer me to him urgently. Well, after 10 days my GP was fed up of the wait and I asked if I should go private, that I did and was seen next day. Enough symtoms to diagnose TA and put on 60mg daily prednisone and saw next day by eye hospital, changes noted at back of eye, vision not as good as previously but still ok with my glasses on. Question, do you think I was started on Steroids in time? with those symtoms it could have gone on much longer undected, that I still have vision 5 days after steroids began, is that a good indicator??? Any info would be greatly appreciated, sight loss is terrifies me! I know I also have to think of affect of steroids but at the moment my sight is worth it! I'm trying to stick to low salt, low fat, high calcium (by tablets as I'm dairy free except goats products), high vit D and Risedronate sodium for ostoporosis. I also have MS & Alopecia Aerata, getting beyond a joke now! Any help appreciated.

"I was diagnosed by my doctor 2 years ago as having PMR although it did not show as definate in my bloods. Looking back I had symptoms for several months before a mild fever after which I was absolutelty wiped out.
I took low level steroids for eight months starting at about 8 mg. I felt relatively lucky becuase I had not had it as bad as others. However I am really disapointed as it seems to have returned again after a year symptom free again it is not showing in my bloods but I am being put back on steroids. Is this a common occurance to have a replapse ( and for it not to show in the bloods) and does anyone know if I might have been doing anything to cause it to come back  back?
I am self employed in quite physical work and it had a great impact last time. However there is a feeling that this is the devil I know but would really appreciate knowing others experience as I thought it was behind me and that is not the case and I am not being referred to a specialist to ask questions?
many thanks.

"Hi...back again about the rash!  Since last posting have been up and down, in and out, rash spreading....and ""flaring"" to the point of need ice packs all vet my torso, mostly.  Went to Detmatologist today..sobbing!! Unbelievable....have never done that! She said MEDROL is too weak...told me to wash everything again in ""All"", a detergent with no xtra ingredients.
Gave me a prescription for prednisone starting with 60 mg today, 40 tomorrow, 30, then 20....then back to my regular 9 mg which I take for the PMR. Hard to believe this rash is not connected to either PMR and/or the prednisone...and the suppression of the immune system....? Has anyone had this rash? She said it is definitely a contact dermatitis...not hives or heat rash.
I typically do not have sensitive skin! Thank you for any input.

"Hello Forum...it is 3.30am and I am Sleepless in Zimbabwe and ( so excited I have to share with you) PAIN-FREE! I am the forum member whose prednisolone prescription took me from 40mg to 10mg over a four-week period. After a month of struggling on the 10mg doseage (relentless pain, fatigue and severe depression) I took your advice and yesterday returned to my GP armed with the printed Bristol paper suggested as the PMR-Treatment blueprint by Eileen and some of Eileen's excellent posts. My GP has reverted to 40mg daily and within a few hours of taking the exra 30mg the pain melted away. I had forgotten in a short month what being without pain was like. She is bringing me down fortnightly by 5mg (I know too fast for my PMR friends) but I am delighted right now. So...Viva Prednisolone - even if that's why I 'm so perky at (now) 4am!

"Hi Mrs O
Eileen assures me you are the one to direct a question to regarding diet. Do you have any words of wisdom on the best anti inflammatory diet and if sticking to it will help with PMR in conjunction with the pred ie. helping the prednisolone to work quicker and preventing flare ups at a later date.  Or in your opinion do you think there may be a link to food sensitivities/allergies and these inflammatory diseases and would it be worthwhile getting checked out for food sensitivities.   Here in Aust they cost close to $800 so if anyone has expereince with these tests with good or bad results I'd be grateful to hear about it.

"I have been diagnosed with PMR 9 months ago.  Pain came on rapidly over a weeks time, and started primarily in hips and somewhat in shoulders.  Went to GP and did a prednisone taper starting with 50mg and tapering to 10mg.  Felt better within a day and pain gone in 2 days.  But once done with taper, pains came back within 4 days.  Over the next 8 months I have been on prednisone constantly, as high as 15mg and docs keep wanting me to reduce to 5mg.  I never get there and pain gets bad and have to go up to either 15mg (no pain) or 10mg with some ibprofen to supplement.  Pain in hips has gotten progressively better but shoulders got worse where it was hard to put on shirt or coat and hard to raise arm above shoulder level.  That was 3 months ago.  Now am seeing a Rhumatologist and he now has me on Methotrexate in addition to prednisone.  He did that with the intent on the metho to be able to reduce prednisone to 5mg or less.  Pain in hips and shoulders is nearly gone now at 7mg prednisone and 20mg metho.  But now have pain in both hands in the fingers with pain and swelling especially in morning.  It was OK at 10mg prednisone but not at 7 or 8.  So because of the pain and swelling in the fingers the Rhuemy now says I have RA, and that is why he is doing the metho.  Try 20 and up to 25 if necessary.
My question to all you experienced PMR patients, does all this sound reasonable?  Does pain in fingers rule out PMR now and is RA the correct diagnosis?  My main reason for asking is that it seems to me that the PMR has simply started in some joints, been cured or nearly so in those joints but is making the circuit and traveling to others.  Can PMR affect fingers in later stages.  My ESR and CRP was elevated in early stages but now seems to be in norm at last check 3 months ago.
I appreciate your reponses.  I am a 67 year old male living in USA

"Last week I told you about my withdrawal.
I had not been able to do the drop from 15 to 12.5 without really bad withdrawal. So I did 1/2mg over 6 weeks and was down to 13.5 and 13 every other day. Id get a little aching at first which would subside.
I went to see the rheumatologist and she said i will have to come off much quicker due to side effects and told me to do 12.5 one day and 10 the next. So with faith I did that and the pain came back in my going/hip area, my lower back/pelvic area and biceps slightly. 
I phoned her and she did call back a few days later. She told me to stick it out till I see her but, its impossible as it was just too painful. The worst is the fatigue and feeling like I am coming down with something.
So I went back up to 13.5 where I had been comfortable before and have been on that for a few days but, I am still in the same pain. Its not as bad as when I was first diagnosed but still I feel unwell and stiff and things like getting in and out if the bath means I have to lift my legs with my hands etc.
My GP is calling me tomorrow and I will explain it to him. ny suggestions.

"Hi...I have posted before about this rash. I was diagnosed in March and have tapered the prednisone to 9 mg. Daily as of one week ago, I have had the rash about 4-5 days; it looks like severe prickly heat. The doctor today looked at all my meds, considered some kind of contact with grass..?.....food, soap, detergent, etc. We are trying Benedrl tablets and cream. Has anyone out there had a rash traced to the PMR and/or Prednisone? The itching is driving me crazy! Maybe I should, at the very least, go back to 10 mg pred to see if that helps. The rash is trying to spread...down my legs...across my chest, etc.
all ideas will be considered! Thank you!

"Hi
Name: Paul - Age: 53 - Sex: Male
I have been suffering with pain and fatigue in the areas you would expect and others for 15 years now.
I have had virtually every test there is to have, y specialist bandies about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Chronic Pain Syndrome.
I am currently on 2 x Fluxotine in the morning, 1 symvastatin at night then 4 times a day 2 x tramadol 2 x paracetemol and 2 x ibuprofen 27 pills a day.
I gave up work 9 months ago as i just could not manage it any longer I had a great job too which made it even harder.
On many occasions I have felt the NHS has given up after extensive tests but I have kept on to my local gp as at this time I have no life so to speak but more importantly my partner has no life, we dont go out, sex is getting less and less frequent and some days I dont get out of bed.
Recently I went to my gp and he suggested PMR as my blood tests have showed inflamation for a number of years but not enough to cause anyone to follow up, they always ask if I am getting over anything, my gp has now written to my specialist to see if steriods could be a correct treatment.
6 weeks later i am still waiting to find out six weeks doesnt sound long in the overall scheme of things but it seems like forever I just want my life back. I have spent my lifes savings getting by and need to get back to work for mine and my partners sake I feel ike I am wating her life and my own.
I have some syptoms that make me feel its not PMR I have not lost any weight i put that down to inactivity and I suffer a continuos high pitched ringing in the ears and neck headache, my eye sight seems to have gotten worse this last year but i sort of put that down to working on a computer a lot, but having read up on pmr i am now a little concerned its something else but could i be just imagining these things in hope of a diagnosis.
Any help on symptoms experienced would be a great help and relief.
Thanks

"Hiya everyone. It's a little while since I posted a question here because thankfully I have been feeling good while reducing my preds (which I am on for GCA) I am down to 7mg now however, since yesterday I have had a slight pain in my right jaw joint. My GCA presented in my left temple and jaw when I was diagnosed last Oct.  It really isn't as bad as the pain I had then, plus no pain in my head. Can I direct my question to MrsO and EileenH please. Do you think this could be the start of a flare up. I am going to have  bloods taken tomorrow before I see my rheumy on Sept 2nd. Will they show if it definitely is a recurrence. I do hope it isn't as I really don't want to have to increase my preds!  I know it's really important to do so though and if it is a recurrence then I will do so willingly. Would be so grateful for your advice as I am a bit concerned. Thank you very much. Luv Mary xx

"I have recently had blood tests again and have a low esr. I have symptoms of pmr and discussed these with my gp. I begged her for prednisolone and she reluctantly agreed but only one week. I felt great! I was walking normally, getting out of bed for the whole day where I was bed bound a lot before, just felt so wonderful having so little pain in my hips and shoulders. My blood tests came back normal and she said she cant give me any more and is referring me to rheumatology again. The pain has come back, my hips are crippling me my shoulders are so so painful again and nothing else has worked, just the prednisolone. My orthopaedic specialist may give me one more injection in ten days, vpbut that will be the third and he said 3 is the max so I should have relief for 3 weeks, if previous injections are to go by but after that........i dont know how I can cope any more with this dreadful pain!

"I first had  PR about 7 years ago my legs ceased up and it was painful walking. My GP was good recognised the problem and started me off on prednisone. The latest flare up was completely different and I didn't recognise it as the same problem. I was unwell tired with headaches daily my dr took bloods which showed an esr of 137. Worryingly I started to get a shade over my right eye which I now know to be one of the symptoms of GCA. I was immediately out on a high dose of prednisone which I have now just come off. I think the problem is you get used to no aches and pains so it is a struggle to get back to what you are like at 65 which is my age and get used to the everyday aches and pains. I do worry about flare ups.

"Diagnosed in May after suffering 5 months. In the US the idea is to get the dose down ASAP. For me it was 60mg 1st day, 20 2nd day, 15 for days 3 to 7. Then 12.5 for 2weeks and finally down to 10.  All reductions caused return of symptoms for mornings or longer. Next schedule is 1mg reduction per month. While still suffering symptoms every morning, it occurred to me that the doctors explanation of taking total dose in the AM to coincide with body's natural production, may not work for all patients. 
I divided my dose(now at 9mg) to AM and PM and have not had any symptoms for a week. I will follow the monthly reductions untill there is a problem at which time I'll go on the UK schedule I have read here. Thanks for the info.

"Hi everyone.
I have been suffering with badly aching lower legs. My gp said that even though I am on diuretics (which thankfully have reduduced the swelling), I still have excess fluid in my ankles and feet. My physio advised massaging from foot to knee in an upward stroke towards the heart. I did this the same evening and it did relieve the aching. However, when I got up next morning my lower leg was covered in small bruises! Bang went the massaging, back came the ache! Any ideas anyone?!
Also I have high blood pressure which is not responding to medication. I have been prescribed about six different tablets over the last year but nothing is working. I am currently on Lercanidipine and Flurosemide and apart from what seems like constant trips to the loo and the previously mentioned reduction of swollen feet and ankles, they are still not working. Is this part of the pmr or pred related? Does anyone else have this problem? My partner has (bless him)! bought me a footstool so that I can sit with my feet up in the evening. I have to make sure that my foot sticks out over the edge otherwise my heel burns like mad. Is this normal?
On a positive note, I am now two weeks into the slow reduction plan and so far so good. I know it's early days but I am really pleased to be doing something to take back some control over this weird disease!

"Was diagnosed originally back in 2007 - and although I have never managed to get off the steroids completely I was down to 1 mg daily and was definitely living life to the full - but have always listened to my body and have been kind to myself - resting when necessary but taking exercise and eating healthily - my previous skirmish showed me how to manage my fatigue and pain/discomforts and retain a good quality of life.  Then suddenly last week-  3 days  after a superb family holiday  I suddenly can't move again.  My GP was wonderful - apart from having to get a taxi to surgery and having to somehow sit in a waiting room for over an hour - she managed to get me booked for a blood test that day, arranged a hip x ray just to make sure she wan't missing anything and then upped my steroids to 25mg plus pain relief.  So this time within in 3 days of onset I was having steroids which many of you know is such a relief.  Yes my CRP was 129 (but my hip x ray is  all good) so now i've to to start all over again!! I am frightened and don't know if i can go through it all again - i hate the affect of prednisolone and the restrictions and frustrstions all again.  You were all such as good support system last time - I'd read the forum posts for hours when i couldn't cope with much else, so I hope to gain your support again this time - some of the contributors are still the same I see!!  - hope that doesn't mean you have had relapses yourselves.
Any tips on handing relapses - am I likely to get through this episode more quickly and be able to reduce more effectively.  My family keep reminding me i did get back to normal last time and i will again but i must admitt i am feeling quite low at the moment. Are there any advances in the research and treatment over the last few years.  I shall look forward to any replies.

"Hello
I am writing this on behalf of my wife who is 59 and has been suffering with frozen shoulder and then polymyalgai for 2 years (although recent blood tests have been negative).
After reading lots of useful discussions on this forum, I suspect my wife (who is scared of the steroids) has probably come off them too quickly and relapsed as she has the same symptoms as 12 months ago and a few more like discomfort in her jaw, ear, knee etc.
I would like to help her find a specialist who can:-
- confirm and diagnose her condition (I presume she has polymyalgia despite the blood tests)
- give clear advice on the steroid options (I suspect different steroids have different side effects for different patients so maybe she needs to trial?)
- draw up a plan to help her live with the condition and optimise any chances she has of ever ridding herself of it
Sounds simple, but we did speak to a specialist a few months ago and whilst he was very sympathetic and appeared to be knowledgeable, we didn't get the answers to the above.
We live in Beaconsfield (25 miles NW of London) so can easily get to places such as London, Oxford, Watford, Reading etc.
Can anyone recommend a good specialist who might be able to give us the direction/guidance we need?

"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with PMR in May and am a very atypical suffer. I am male, 59 years old and think I’ve had mild PMR symptoms for about 10 years until a huge flare up in March. I have managed to reduce my dose down to 10mg from 20mg leaving slight aches and pains and weak muscles.
I am concerned about side effects. My two questions are the following. How likely is it to get type 2 diabetes on my 10mg dose. I have tried to cut my sugar intake down to a minimum, this has been hard as I was a chocoholic and still like an occasional beer.
Also 2 weeks ago I had to stop taking Alendronic acid tablets because of eye redness and pain – will my dose of Pred still leach the old calcium from my bones and if so at what rate? I take Adcal tablets to create new calcium. My doctor says because of my age and gender I will be fine without the Alendronic acid, but I can’t find anything online to confirm this.
I am still quite fit, walk a lot and work part time in a fairly physical job. I ignore the PMR symptoms and consider myself very lucky compared to the suffering I read about on this forum.
All the best to you all.

"Hi all...sorry I dont contribute much... do look in and often people far wiser than me with PMR have already given great feedbackor a question I came to ask has already been asked and answered.
As some of you know, my rheumatologist is Dr Quick who co-wrote and co-research the Bristol paper. I am in Hertfordshire so felt lucky she has a placement as the consultant here.
My problem is this.
I struggled with all my drops and so have only been able to do 1/2mg at a time following Eileen’s regime. However, once I was at 12.5 Dr Quick told me to do 12.5 one day and 10mg the next. This would mean I could continue on the gastro resistant, coated tablets.
 Well I have tried for 2.5 weeks and the pain and stiffness are just to difficult…not to mention the return of chronic fatigue and a low grade temp.
 My appointment with her is not until September but I managed to speak on the telephone with her. She said to try and continue for a while and ordered a blood test. Thing is, if I have the white tablets they give me bad stomach pains (cant take stomach meds) but if I eat a massive breakfast with porridge and yoghurt and rice crispies I seem to buffer them okay.
So I feel I should try ½ mg a day…say 12.5 one day and 11.5 the next….or should I go back to 12.5 a day for a week or something and then try?
Dr Quick said perhaps This questions the diagnosis of PMR and I may need a pet scan
Anyone else had one of those?
My thinking is I am just struggling to reduce.

When discussing vitamin D and Calcium they write:-
Rule is - Early AM - Prednisolone (with food)

"Hello
I have been following this forum since November 2013 when I was diagnosed with pmr and have found it most informative and helpful.
I did not start with the more usual severe and debilitating shoulder and hip pain but with feeling generally unwell, generalised aches and pains, high temperature, fatigue, night sweats, poor appetite and weight loss. After 2 weeks of thinking it was viral I saw my gp who took bloods for inflammatory markers. Both ESR and CRP were over 100. I have had shoulder pain for some time but put it down to a combination of renovating our house, looking after 3 lively grandchildren and age (66yrs). I have always been able to lift my arms above my head etc although the hairdryer felt very heavy at times.
My gp having talked about pmr referred me to a rheumatologist because of my symptoms, blood results and my father had rheumatoid arthritis.
I was seen 2 days later privately more bloods were taken to rule out various cancers and an ultra sound scan done. All were clear (sigh of relief) but my ESR was 128 and CRP was 164 and Hb 90.
The rheumatologist felt that as other things had been ruled out that it might well be atypical pmr and started me on 40mg prednisolone for 1 week then 30 mg for 1 week then 20mg for 5 weeks then 15mg. I felt much better within a day of starting the prednisolone.
In January my ESR had dropped to 75 and CRP to 19 and Hb up to 121 all good.
I have had good days and bad days the bad days are usually when I have been doing too much,but I am gradually learning my limitations.
The week before last I was to reduce to 13mg (I am taking Lodotra which costs a fortune but is brilliant) but I did not feel well and my shoulders were very sore (doing too much) and my ESR was up to 86 and CRP up to 33.
I felt much better last week but stayed on 15mg until Monday this week then reduced to 13mg, so far so good.
My gp phoned today to say he has discussed the blood results with the rheumatologist who feels that I should increase my prednisolone to 20mg and go back to the usual enteric coated as he is not sure about the Lodotra.
After discussion with my gp we have agreed that I will continue with 13mg Lodotra and have bloods repeated next week when hopefully they will be down again. Its good to have a gp who will listen and discuss.
I hope I am doing the right thing but would be grateful for any advice.
Thanks
Barbara

"HI
I was just wondering if there would be side effects to the body/organs if the PMR was not treated with drugs. I was thinking exercise may help.  My reason for this is last week I was throwing and walking for about 11/2hrs (90mins) and the pain at first was almost unbearable however I had to get this job done so I kept going and towards the end of that time I noticed the pain had gone.  Think I paid for it a bit the next day but got me wondering.   Prednisone is obviously the drug of choice and I was worrying about the loss of bone density from a long term usage. I have a lot of questions.
1 What is long term usage
2 How slowly should Prednisone be reduced  I started on 15mg 2 months ago and am now on 10mg with bearable pain coming back in  muscle of arm and wrist. Dr said to reduce every 2 weeks - is that time for my body to adjust its own production of cortisone?

"I have been suffering from PMR for about 8 months and am on a decreasing
course of Preds, now down to 12.5 mg.(been higher and been lower)
I also suffer with Post Herpetic Neuralgia (the after effects of shingles) for which I take Tramadol and Amitriptyline.
The problem I have is that as they both effect much the same area of my body, ie. my shoulders and neck how do I tell which of the complaints is causing pain at any given time. The pain with PMR seems to come in lumps whilst the pain with PHN is slightly more precise, but sometimes I don't know which is which.
I have been led to understand that drugs like Tramadol have little or no effect on the relief of PMR.and if this is the case then the pain I'm suffering at present must be PHN.I don't want to start upping my Preds unless I realy have to. I would find it difficult to explain it to my doctor  as the last PMR flare up I had didn't make much difference to the blood tests that were taken at the time.
Any body got any advice?, is it right about the Tramadol not relieving the pain of PMR?

For my part I decided to opt for covering the pain, giving it chance to settle and then head for the long haul . . . . . but out if this comes another serious question and that's about the 'hissy shakes' (I think that was what it was called).

"Hi Folks,
I've been following your advice and re-upping my dose[ (down to 5mg) tried to go to 4mg but symptoms flared big time] but just got back from the endocrinologist who monitors my bone density and he says that it's going down and that it is probably due to the prednisone. I'm in the osteoporosis range in the hip - not the spine yet -just osteopenia.
In any case do you all think that it's time for me to change medications. And if so does anyone know of one that does not destroy the bone density?

"hello PMR/GCA forum, 
Im in shock as last week my dad suddenly lost his sight 
it was eventually diagnosed at the hospital as GCA. sadly he is now blind
my question is: should his optician have picked this up in his eye tests?
Dad was reading the newspaper and suddenly couldnt see.
they went to the NHS optician who tested him and said she would write a letter to his GP. 
3 days later he visited his GP who ignored his symptoms and told him to go home!
thankfully he went to the hospital who admitted him immediately started steroids, but sadly his vision is gone. 
Im sure everyone has sad stories like this to share. 
but i really want to understand if he has been having regular eye tests, should the optician have noticed the eye problems and referred him sooner? he is 85 but very active and generally healthy.
and when he presented with greatly reduced vision last week, is the optician accountable for not telling him to go straight to A&E with a medical emergcency?
can GCA be picked up in standard NHS eye tests? or at least reduced blood circulation of the eye? any ideas anyone?
many thanks all

"I'm eighteen months into Polymyalgia Rheumatica having stated at 30mg (I think weight influenced starting dose). Immediate, miraculous freedom, felt like I could fly! Dropped 5mg after a week - fine, another week and another 5mg and still fine. But the next drop  of 2.5mg saw a return if symptoms.
Back to 20mg and everything well. Fo six months tried to get down but always stuck at 17mg, so stated at 17.5mg fir a while and then tried again.
Suddenly I was good for a gentle drop down to 10mg and felt on top of things. But by now the Rhumi had finally granted me an appointment and he was happy for a 1mg drop per 4-6 weeks.
Git to 8mg and all exploded! This coincided with next Rhumi appointment but a different one who gave me a high dose injection in the bum and said back in 4-6 weeks . . . Actually it was eight weeks before I could get an appointment by which time I had upped myself to 10mg and was on the edge! The same Rhumi then announced that the Polymyalgia Rheumatica had gone and I was suffering from steroid withdrawal and that I should take Amitriptyline fir the pain and push through.
When I told the Doc a few days latter, he raised his eyebrow!
My Doc us brilliant and totally supports me and naturally wants me of the Prednisolone. But I have a Rhumi who says it's gone and a Doc who knows it has not. In fact the Doc got me to have another blood test which showed my markers were on the way up and that something was happening.
i need to be on 12.5mg at the moment to be free . . . Then make a new plan. Today I'm on 10mg and got the invisible shakes with that muscular restraint that slows you down. Nothing seized up and I'm mobile but just don't want to move too far.
So what should I do? What I'm really saying is do I push on in misery or go back up to possible 12.5mg, get happy and start again . . . .

"Been taking 20 mg prednisone for pmr since May and still having morning stiffness and other symtoms so rheumatalogist started me on nightly dosage (15Mg) of melaxicam a couple weeks ago and wanted me to see how that works for a month or may try methotrexate at my next appointment.    Although I think the melaxicam has helped take the edge off my remaining morning stiffness, the stiffnest is still there in the background all the time. More importantly  i have had increasingly daily brief episodes of dizziness/vertigo  and near faintilng since i started taking it - these are usually fleeting and pass quickly but at the same time scary.  Truthfully not sure if these new dizzy spells are due to the pmr, prednizone or the new melaxicam.  Do others have experience with this drug - i note it has some other serious possible side effects which are also alarming.   Not sure what the comparison is with methotrexate but read others take that and may want to further discuss with my rhematologist as she mentioned as this would be the next thing to try.  Thanks for any feedback in advance.

"Hi everyone... Just been diagnosed with PMR and GCA as well as Fibromyalgia. I'd been doing a highly repetitive manual job and the physio initially thought I had cervical spinal stenosis with myeleopathy, irritated be the hunched over and repetitive behaviour while looking down. A very astute company doctor (not my usual doctor) ordered blood tests then did a very extensive set of hands on tests, which was confirmed later on by the rheumatologist. PMR is riddled throughout my fathers family also.
However, I know for a fact that I have suffered from these symptoms before, and just thought I was perhaps a bit 'soft' and would push myself through them with great pain and suffering. Maybe I wore myself out?! My own (ex) doctor used to roll her eyes when she saw me coming, complaining of the same aches, pains, depression and fatigue... Yet would only offer counselling.
I've had irritable bowel and asthma for several years, but in this process have also found out I have Haemachromatosis and a metabolic lipoid disorder that are both hereditary through a defect in the MTHFR gene which has also come through my fathers side... Many offspring in the last two generations have autism features and aspergers which is a result of the MTHFR deletion in the DNA ... The gene that releases the enzyme that breaks down metals in the body, hence the storing of iron etc in the organs and creating toxicity in the blood, especially mercury etc in vaccinations. I read in a long list of symptoms from severe to mild, that PMR and other autoimmune diseases as well as food sensitivities are caused by it. I totally feel like I've been hit with the faulty gene stick!
My fathers side are from Ireland and my mothers from Shetland, and I am a sixth generation New Zealander. I'm told it is a 'white' mans disease of those from Northern European descent.
I've been on 30mg prednisone for two days now, and apart from having a raging cold, I'm feeling almost sprightly.
I look forward to chatting with you all and learning more about self-care, which I've been lacking in my busy family and work lifestyle. (I also live in and care for my elderly father)
Warm thoughts to you all.

Shoulder pain is getting gradually a lot worse, my knees are the same and sometimes go purple for no reason, sore fingers with those hermywotsits on my knuckles, my toes get really sharp pains through them too and random pains that just stay in the same place for a day or two then move on, oh and fatigue! Anyone give me advice? Thank you.

"For the past 18 months I have been living with considerable pain which is severely affecting my quality of life. I can hardly get out of bed in the morning as I am so stiff and in pain and my sleep is very disturbed by painful hips and feet. I am almost 53 and have been to the GP and had blood tests which have all came back normal. I have gone from being lively with a lot of energy and get up and go to having little energy, finding it painful to exert myself, even walking, and am getting quite low about it all. I have put on weight due to my inactivity but do eat ry healthily. My Dad has PMR and GCA which I have mentioned to my GP. How do I get the doctor to listen as I am starting to feel she thinks I am a neurotic middle aged woman. I just want some quality of life back.

"My mum has had polymyalgia rheumatica for nearly 3 years, she was 64 when it started and very fit for her age. The year it started she had 'flu' type symptoms several times, and it was a good year before she was diagnosed and steriods administered. At first she made good progress, but then she suffered an attack of temporal arteritis and was in hospital for a week on high doses of steriods. This was a worrying time because it affects your eyesight. 3 years down the road she is still on steriods, limps very badly, walks really slow, tires easily, and has numb feet. The numb feet is the baffling bit, she has had all sorts of tests and no one is able to give any reason, anyone else had this problem?

"I think I may be one of the lucky ones but I was diagnosed with PMR 5 weeks ago and have been on 20 mg of Pred since then. I feel that I am making good headway on this dose although they do tend to take 4 to 5 hrs to work once taken after breakfast. Pain in my arms and behind my legs still tends to wake me in the mornings and are very achy for most of the morning although nowhere near as bad. Once the Pred gets going I feel very little discomfort in my arms and legs unless I do something stupid and have started to try and be more active. I was a fairly fit 64 year old with no other medical problems before I got PMR but I get the impression my doctor would like me to go up to 25 or even 30 mg of Pred as I still feel pain first thing in the morning, and she thinks this would help with the pain. My thoughts are that the Pred eases the pain not eradicates it completely, or am I wrong. I would like to know what my fellow suffers think who have had PMR longer than I have, am I expecting to much to soon. Best wishes to you all.

"Having been on Pred for six months, i only recently found out that certain foods should be avoided (white bread, processed foods, too much sugar etc). I have therefore been trying to eat more wholefoods for the last couple of weeks e.g loads of fruit and veg., only granary or wholemeal bread, honey and lemon drinks and have cut sugar and fat where I can. Can anyone tell me why, I am now bloated like a whale, am in more pain and keep falling asleep every time I attempt physical activity?! To be completely fair, I did overdo it a couple of weeks ago as my partner had two big contracts to do and I worked with him to get them done. However, that was then and I thought the effects of that should have worn off by now. Has anyone found a way of upping energy levels successfully? Also, can I blame the pred or the pmr for this setback? Is it worth persevering with the new food regime? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am having a procedure done mid-July for an electronic implant for my spinal condition and would like to be as healthy as possible by then.

"Hi I am 56 and was diagnosed with PMR May 2009 but had had my symptoms for 2 years. My GP sent me everywhere but did not diagnose me until a new GP did my blood tests again and I was 75. My GP is monitoring me.
I have always been active going to the gym 3 times a week circuit training twice and running. I asked him if I should carry on training and he said he didn't see why not.
I do a lot of free weights and weight machines and usually the day after I feel as bad as ever. Should I carry on hoping that this will help me or should I do more gentle exercise. I have got down to 7.5 mgs but think I should up them as I still have pain in neck and shoulders and when I breathe in.
I want to get off the pred. as I have put half a stone on in weight, and that is partly why I want to go to the gym. Any advice would be appreciated.

"Could anyone give me some good advise? You see I am in a bit of a mess at the moment and could really do with your help.
I have been having really bad pains in my shoulders, neck, arms and hips. My doctor sent me to a rheumy and dispite having zero negative blood results and a two hour consultation the Rheumy hold I have PMR Giant Cell and Rheumatiod Arthritis (really bad deformed fingers).
I was immediatly but on 40mg Prednesilone and Methotrexate. I have not started the Mxt yet as I side effects are supposed to be really bad.
My Rheumy wants me to take 40mg of Pred. for a month then taper down, I have now been on them for three weeks and are still getting shooting pains in one side of my head and it still feels like a thumping pressure I can also feel my vain swollen.  I do not get a jaw of blurred vision.  Are these symptoms normal after three weeks? 
Since I have been told that I have all these health problems I am having a really bad time coming to terms with it.  I have gone from healthy 51 old expecting I may just have PRM to a nervous wreck who cannot sleep, think. I cannot see much of a future all I see is years of health problems and really strong medication.  I have been told dont drink, eat sugar.  I seem to be angry and crying a lot and thats is not like me.
I sorry to go on about this as I know there is a lot of people who are much worst off than I and guilt is a big thing with  me at   the moment (how many times can you agolise in one day)?

"Greetings from Sardinia where I'm on holiday. Before I left I went back up to 5mg from 4mg which I'd been on for a week or two, as I was not feeling good and my CRP levels had gone up to 14 (which is high for me). My consultant was determined to get me off steroids because she now thinks I don't have PMR (on the somewhat dubious basis that my CRP levels had gone down while I was on 5 and my main symptoms are now a swollen knee, frozen shoulder and pain in lower back and upper arms)
Having stirred the inflammation up again I am not sure 5mg is now enough and as I'm on a boat I'm finding it quite difficult getting out of a bunk bed and generally not feeling as energetic as I'd like on holiday.
I know Eileen takes her steroids on alternate days and I wondered if I could do that while here - ie take 10mg every other day so at least I'd feel good on the first day...
Ideally I'd like to try and keep to 5mg as it worked for me before and I can certainly cope on that when home. 
The consultant wants me on 3 mg by my next appointment in July/August (ain't going to happen!) so that she an do more tests to see what's going on.

It was comforting at first to hear the GP say I am to young to be afflicted with this as both male and just over 50. So I have read through some of the threads and it has helped me already come to terms with my way of life changing.  I was a fully active sportsman until recently, a full active life outside work and an even full on work life......everything has changed even the physical side of my marriage.
I am determined that with some alteration I can lead a near normal life  as possible; reading some of these posts have certainly re focussed my thinkingI had been living in blissful ignorance of this condition UNTIL now.

"Following suspected dx of GCA and put on 60mg Prednisone 11 days ago, I had my biopsy today, it was more than I had expected, an hour in theatre with a local anaesthetic, I expected 10 mins in a treatment room but I guess give what they had to do, it had to be as it was, just as well I didn't know before! So now the wait for the result which I know could not be definitive . I get blood tests on Monday then wait to see GP the following week (he's on holiday) to see how my inflammatory markers are, they were coming down prior to steroids so hopefully with steroids the picture will be much improved. The plan is to gradually reduce the steroids over 18 months. I am trying to stick to complex carbohydrates and limit them and eat more protein in the hope this will help avoid too much weight gain.
This is my third auto immune disease, I have MS, dx in 2001 but had it 15 years without knowing = 28 years, still on my feet so not bad! Then 3 years ago I got Alopecia Areata, where hair retured it's white! Need to wear a wig because growth at bottom back did not return. Now possible GCA! Obviously my immune system is troubled! I can outwardly handle stress but don't seem to deal with it internally, MS onset, Alopecia onset and now this all coincide with times of huge stess, My mum hit the nail on the head I think, some people exlode, I seem to implode. What I can do about it I'm not sure but I think I need to do something or I could end up in more trouble!
The consultant told me that TA/GCA does not normally come back but reading on here that does not seem to be the case. My symptoms were so slight to start with and not things I would connect and tell the GP, one has to be very vigilent to spot this.

"About 7 years ago my Dr placed me on Symvastin because my younger brother ha a quintuple bypass and my maternal side ha heart problems. about a year after starting statins I started experiencing muscle cramps in just about every muscle in my body when I got out of bed in the morning. These cramps persisted for about 2 hours and then I was OK until the next morning. I took myself of statins (the internet is an amazing resource) and my cramping stopped.
I will tell you, that pain and cramps I experienced before GCA and prednisone was very similar to the cramps I experienced with statins. If you are on statins and since we share a genetic desease you could have the same allergy to statins that I have. Discuss this with your physician before altering your medicines. If stopping statins help you, let the forum know. It took me about a week to become pain free but we all know our condition is forever. Damn those Vikings!

"Hi Folks. I’ve been reading your forum for weeks now and truly appreciate all the advice and support you share. I decided it was time to stop being a voyeur and join in. I live in a small community of about 5000 in the Northwest Territories, Canada. We have no permanent Doctors, only locum physicians and occasional Specialist Physician clinics.
Here’s my story…I have had bilateral pain and stiffness in both legs for over 10 years. After walking or standing for an hour or 2 my legs got very heavy, getting in and out of a car was difficult and stairs just plain painful. After seeing many doctors and specialists over the years with no answer I simply preserved. In mid-January my right wrist flared up with pain and swelling. A locum doctor advised it was likely arthritis. A week later, my right knee and leg gave out on me. In mid-February, both my shoulders went. I saw another locum doctor and was diagnosed with strained rotator cuffs issues and advised that the knee was likely arthritis. I was given a booster shot of some anti-inflammatory, a strong anti-inflammatory prescription, and a muscle relaxant. None of the medication helped much at all. Exactly a week later my entire upper body went! Shoulders and upper arms were useless!! I decided to make an appointment with a Nurse Practitioner, a permanent resident of Hay River. No more locum doctors! Best move I could have made. He listened to my horror story, order x-rays of shoulders and knees; increased the strength of the anti-inflammatory meds; and added Tylenol 3 to the mix. The Tylenol helped with the pain, but symptoms persisted. By early March I couldn’t do anything, including lie down in bed. My upper arm muscles and right knee/leg would scream in pain. Then the other knee/leg started going on me. That’s when I started sleeping in my lounge chair. I actually managed to get 5 or 6 hours of sleep. Rather than drag the story out too much longer; over the next 2 weeks I saw the NP on a regular basis. We both agreed whole-heartedly that it was not arthritis! (X-rays showed minor arthritis in shoulders and knees) My body was working against me. All my inflammation markers were through the roof. NP consulted throughout the process with the physiotherapist whom I started seeing, and an out of town specialist. In mid-March I got the news that PMR was suspected. I started that day at a dose of 20 mg of prednisone. It seemed to help initially: however, symptoms returned in full force 3 days later. Dosage was increased to 25 mg. Three days later I had a complete melt down…the day before my 65th Birthday! I couldn’t stand to get out my sleeping chair. I didn’t have enough strength in my arms or legs! Fortunately, my NP called the same day to advise that I had and appointment scheduled in Yellowknife (nearest location of a specialist) 2 days later. Further, the specialist advised to up the Prednisone dosage to 40 mg. As much as I hated to, I upped the meds as suggested in the early afternoon. I was able to sleep in my own bed that night! My 65th arrived. I had slept in my bed comfortably all night and was able to get up with everything moving fine!! Happy Birthday to me! I saw the specialist in YK the next day. He was positive on the PMR diagnosis AND confirmed that leg issues I had been having for 10 years were the start of the problem. After 2 weeks I began tapering down in 5 mg drops. The recommendation was to drop 5 mg every 2 weeks until I reach 15 mg; then taper by 2.5 per month until 10; then monthly by 1 g. I’m now at 25 mg. A few symptoms returned the last 5 mg drop; however, they seem to be fading after 10 days. I’m scheduled to drop another 5 in a few days and am fearful of a further, more aggressive return of symptoms. Thanks to all that I’ve read on this forum, I’m considering a drop of 2.5 and waiting 3 weeks before dropping again, if all goes well. My NP supports whatever choice I make.
Comments and observations welcomed.

"I was diagnosed about two years ago with PMR.  My Internist started me on 10 mg of Pred. decreasing one mg every month.  I instantly increased my exercise.  I went from walking four miles a day to eight miles.  I walk four in the morning and four in the evening.  My pain subsides about halfway throuh the first walk.  My pain went away for a few months then it came back at an increased level.  I then requested to see a rheumatologist as I didn't want to go back on Pred.  At that time, I could't lift myself out of a chair without pain.  The rheumatologist started my on 20 mg of Pred. decreasing very slowly.  I instantly felt wonderful.  I had a sense of wellness.  I knew the Pred. was working.  We continued decreasing the Pred. and when I got to 3 mg. the pain returned.  Since the weather is warmer I added a half hour in the pool to my two four mile walks.   I went back to 10 mg. and am now at 5 mg. but I am in pain every morning.  I recently caught a could and the pain increased drammatically but I have maintained the 5 mg.  I fishoil and added turmeric and magnezium.   I welcome any advice.  Thanks.

"I have reduced from 30mg to 15mg since January. I now find myself getting really tired and achey, but not so much first thing as at the end of the day after work..
When I went to the gp initially I had pain, not stiffness and it ended up so bad that I was in the surgery in tears barely able to walk, lift or cross my arms, sit, drive, turn over in bed, get out of bed, etc. Immediate improvement after pred in 24 hours, miracle after 36.
My query is that now the symptoms that are starting to recur are ones I had previous to the acute few weeks. Pain in both buttocks (prev diagnosed as a back problem, tried physio no success) which I'd had for 18 months, aching in my hands, fingers and thumb bases, neck aching (also put down to a back issue).
Get very tired, but then I'm at work, quite a stressful job but not a manual one - and almost no issue first thing in the morning but struggling in the evening.
Have I got pmr? Due at a rheumy check up tomorrow - I've not reduced the pred as much as he wanted and he grudgingly gave a diagnosis of atypical pmr at the first appointment.
Now I'm wondering if he could be right.
My blood test showed a level of 27 last year, it did drop to 4 with the pred but as 27 isn't high it apparently didn't have significance.
Did I imagine the pain?! Was it something else. Not sure what to think at the moment.
Thanks all

"I was diagnosed with PMS two months ago. Started on 15 mg. & then rheumatologist raised it to 20 just for a few weeks as the inflammation was not coming down as fast as wanted. Did blood work & everything was back in normal range so decreased to 17.5 & now have pain in wrists & fingers. Not sure what to do. Do I stay with the decrease or go back up to 20.

"Hi, all, just feel like asking for support or counsel. I have been in so much pain for a month, trying to keep to just 10mg of prednisone. Now I have a sharp pain in my back ribs that goes up to my shoulder and down my right arm. I don't know if I strained a rib or what. Today has been murder and I feel like crying. My apt with dr rheumatologist is Thursday. Anyway the past two days I went up to 20mg of pred, and after taking it I felt better for awhile, till it came back. I don't think I should take more than 20. I hope I can stand it till Thursday.

"I was diagnosed with Polymyalgia last November, and my doctor started me on 15mg. of prednisilone. This was wonderful as I had no more aching arms and wrists. I saw a rheumatologist a couple of months ago who asked me to go down slowly to 10mg which I did, but now have the pain back in my arms and wrists. I told him that I was very lethargic, and he said that could be due to the steroids. I have no energy at all, and have lots of hot flushes.
Has anyone else felt like this?

"Before using this EXCEL spread sheet, my Dr. would say, ""drop from 40 to 30."" I would then suffer for 4 or 5 days with side effect symptoms until my body got used to the new dose. While waiting I would try to determine if I might be having a relapse. The relapse finally happened and I am now working my way back down from 60mg.
This sheet stops the problem with precipitous drops in dosage causing side effects. If you chart the ADP you will see that the taper looks a little like the tilde character ""~"". I have not had any side effect symptoms dropping from 60 - 40 - 30.

"I have recently had a full blown GCA relapse and after looking around the site I do not see any taper recommendations for GCA sized reduction doses.
Prior to my relapse I reduced from 60mg to 15mg in the standard taper listed on this site and recommended by my Dr.. The steps were 60,50,40,30,20,17.5 and finally 15. Each and every time that I reduced I would go through a new and different side affect for 4 or 5 days. I am aware of Eileen's recommendations; however, I do want to try them on the initial rates of reduction for GCA. The reduction from 40-30mg is 25% while a reduction from 30-20mg is 33%. Does anyone on this site know of a pointer to a medically approved taper for these sizes of reductions?

"Hello, I just suffered a GCA relapse only this time it affected my left eye instead of my right eye. I had previously downlined an article called ""BSR and BHPR Guidelines for the management of giant cell arteritis"" and I have posted the relapse extracts below. In the past five weeks I had dropped from 20 mg to 17.5 mg and three weeks later I dropped another 2.5 mg. My rhumatoligist follows the taper guidelines posted in the document listed above. When I dropped to 17.5 mg I had headaches and had a CRP test performed, the reading was in normal guidelines. After dropping from 17.5 to 15 I had temple aches but no other symptoms. On Monday the 28, I visited my ruhmatologist on a normally scheduled visit and had the a blood test and CRP performed. I noticed on a business trip at 10.5k ft. altitude that my heart was beating 100 BPM. On 5/3 I temporarily lost vision in my right eye while in Atlanta, GA. and following the relapse recommendations I went to 60 mg and I am rapidly tapering down to 20.
Looking at relapse recommendations, I should probably have stayed at 20 mg when I had headaches but I do follow Doctor's orders. Why am I blogging this? I. Would like to see if anyone has had a similar experience and what their Dr.'s recommendation was when this happened.
Relapse Recommendations:
BSR and BHPR Guidelines for the management of giant cell arteritis: treat with the previous higher glucocorti- costeroid dosage.
Headache and jaw claudication: treat with 60mg prednisolone.
Eye symptoms: treat with either 60 mg prednisolone or i.v. methylprednisolone

Flew to Atlanta - still slight temple ache from drop tp 15 mg prednisone - Glass of white wine in the evening.
5/3/2014
Woke up with blurry vision in left eye - felt like temple and eye was swollen took 15mg of prednisone. Binged on sweets cake, rolls, etc in forenoon at reception.
3 pm - almost total vision loss in left eye - took 30 mg of prednisone
(Did serious physical work that took a lot of concentration - lost vision in left eye for 20 minutes)
11 pm - had slightly constipated bowel movement : lost 15% of vision field in left eye. Took 10 mg prednisone
5/4/2014
7 am Slight vision focus problem - 20 mg of prednisone
1:30 pm vision ok, heart rate on 15mg was 90 BPM now back at standard 64.
3 pm took 20 mg. It takes 1.5 hrs to take effect and my eyes are feeling weak.

"Hi, I hope someone can help. So my lower back has been causing me alot of pain. I went to the doctors around 3 months ago. He booked me an appointment at the local MRI with a suspected slipped disc, after a little while my back started to feel a bit better, still stiff and pain when bending over but nothing like when I first did it, I still went for my scan. About a week later, whilst putting my socks on, my back seized up in agony, I couldn't move and my legs went dead (pins and needles etc) Took around an hour before I could simply move, the pain was off the chart.
So the MRI scan has come back normal!! (took 5 weeks for the MRI to come back) My back is better than it was a few weeks ago but still sore and stiff.
So if its not a slipped disc what is it? I've got to wait another week to see my doctor, I'm just super fed up now. I'm a young bloke with no history of back problems. I've tried some stretches etc that I found online, but these seem to make my back incredibly weak when going about my day to day life (almost like I can feel its about to slip or hurt if you get my meaning)
Would appreciate any advice.

"When I was first diagnosed with PMR the doctor gave me a pamphlet, and I read about GCA, and thought I had some of its symptoms - including itchy top scalp, trouble swallowing, gritty blurry eyes, and temple pain. When I took the first doses of prednisone I felt so much better! Besides the pain relief in body, I also felt relief in scalp, swallowing, and my eyes felt so clear I was very happy. But when I told the doctor, he immediately discounted my suggestion by saying, ""Oh, no you don't have GCA!"" He was basing this, I guess, on my 40 number of the ""sed rate"" which wasn't that high, he said. Now I'm on 10 mg a day of pred. my eyes are irritating me and swallowing is iffy. Any info or opinions would be appreciated.

"I was diagnosed with PMR last October, just after I turned 50. The pain was devastating for me as I have always been very active and am generally a happy person. I was referred to an excellent rheumy (Dr Irwin Lim @ BJC health connected care Australia if you want to read his excellent blog and info sheets). I was originally put on 15mg Pred, but flared after a while, so went up to 20. I reduced to 15 again and then was put on 20mg/week Methotrexate in December, with an eye to reducing the Pred. I was afraid initially of the possible side effects of both drugs, but was reassured by Dr Lim that I would be closely monitored. I have now managed to reduce the Pred to 8mg/day and what's better is that I have been able to take up exercise again (step classes and 3km runs). My liver and blood results are excellent and I now feel positive and happy again. Slight side effects of the drugs are a small weight increase (hopefully the exercise will take care of that) and a dry mouth once week. I am hoping to continue tapering the Pred very slowly. I hope I haven't jinxed myself with this post, and I also hope that some of you have the same good results that I have. I can't even think about the debilitating pain I used to experience, without tears coming to my eyes. Good luck & best of health to you all!

"Since an ""appreciable"" portion of pred is excreted in the urine as well as the bowels, the implication is that PMR-GCA suffers need to maintain a consistent morning diet before they take their pred.
What happens if one morning I have eggs, bacon and a sweet roll and the next morning I just have a cup of coffee and a muffin? I believe that this will affect the amount of pred that was absorbed into the blood or excreted by the bowls. The eggs and etc. would mean that less pred would enter the blood stream. It seems to me that the lower the dose of pred one is on would make maintaining a pre-pred diet even more important!
Prednisone is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract... The preconversion biological half-life of prednisone is about 60 minutes. Prednisolone is excreted in the urine as free and conjugated metabolites together with an appreciable proportion of unchanged prednisolone. Prednisolone has a usual plasma half-life of 2 to 4 hours

"I know that one of the side effects of prednisone is itchy eyes. Today I was sitting quietly when the outside my lower eyelids started itching/burning in spots where my eyes were tearing. It struck me that this problem might be caused by my tear ducts excreting prednisone. Have members of this forum read anything that can confirm that tear ducts are one of the body's' ways of dumping prednisone?
In addition my lower eyelids are black and I look like I am recovering from a fight or genetically related to a raccoon. I believe that this is caused by rubbing my eyes because of itchy tears and is a side effect of age and prednisone bruising.

Eileen, I read the article that you recommended which was written by John Kirwan, et al. When I realized the implications of the reduction recommendations contained in this article I was very surprised.
My first symptoms were typical PMR symptoms but after 10 days I also started experiencing temporary loss of vision in my right eye. I was placed on the recommended GCA dose of 60 mg. After 6 months of reduction, I am now at 17.5 mg which is near the pred PMR starting range of 20.mI imagine that more than a few people on this forum have suffered both GCA and PMR.
When you reached the dose where you started to feel symptoms again were the first symptoms that you felt that of PMR or GCA?
I was also surprised that this articles recommended taper time for PMR of 110 weeks.

I used to have a dicky tiummy on a Tuesday morning but this is now on a Monday morning (have been taking them since last September, but only had side effects for the past couple of months) I also feel a little nauseous and have a slight tummy ache when I wake up, I also suffer from quite a bit of wind The symptoms only last for when I first get out of bed and usually only on the one morning and then they go.
Going to see my doctor on 31st March so don't know whether I should come off them.
Just a short note to Eileen - I saw the pred reduction list you typed the other day and I have copied it and when my doctor next tells me to reduce I am going to try your way so thanks for that.
Also I saw a posting about cataracts - should I be advising my optician that I take steroids and should I be going for earlier eye test - I wear glasses for reading but have noticed that I can no longer read anything at all unless I have them on.

"I am on 10mgms of Pred which I take in the morning about 8am. I did try taking it at other times but not sure if the time was effective. My issue is I that I am getting hip and shoulder pain in the evening and overnight. My sleeping is awful not going to sleep till sometime between 2am & 3am. Hence why I take the pred at 8am when I usually wake up. I was of the understanding that you should get almost 24 hour relief
Am I doing something wrong am I still under dosed? Need your advice. If anyonehas any ideas re sleeping I would appreciate it. I know that the prednisone does affect sleeping. I take a temazepam (Very mild sleeping tab here in Australia) but this does not really help. Saw an eye specialist today have got a big cataract in the

"Hi all - I was thinking about a year or so before I was diagnosed with PMR and how exhausted I always felt. I thought it was down to stress at the time.
Doing housework or anything took everything I had and Id have to have regular breaks.
Just wondering if anyone else had noticed this.
I am also aware that if I overdo things now, the pain comes back slightly and I have to rest the next day to recover.
Not sure who remembers my previous post about nausea and reduction. I had gone from 15mg to 12.5mg after 6 weeks on 15. I was unsure if that caused the nausea, but as soon as I went to 15mg it stopped. So I have now had to do it very, very slowly and by 1/2 mg's every other day as advised by Eileen and Mrs O (thanks to both of you) I am now at 13.5 every day and will stay there for another 2 weeks and then go to 13 every other day or even 13 1/4.
My problem is being on these doses so long now. I have buffalo hump and my face is chubby...not moon yet, but definitely chubby, although that could be down to the weight Ive put on
Anyone else have buffalo hump and does it go when on lower doses?

"Hello, my mum was diagnosed 2 years ago with polymyalgia, last year she had an episode where the sight in her right eye was nearly lost due to GCA, this was treated with high dose steroids and over a long period of time she has regained sight in this eye. Last week she experienced changes to the sight in her right eye (reduced sight and double vision) after seeing the consultant and blood tests, inflammation was not diagnosed and possibility of the cataracts my mum has developed whilst on steroids may be the cause. Yesterday my mums sight darkened considerably more, she is feeling nauseous and generally unwell so we went to see the consultant again, but again no inflammation found, awaiting blood test results and an MRI scan date and again uncertainty about whether GCA or Cataracts. The advice we have is if her sight goes completely or just black and white come back in, but I am very worried that this will be too late. My mum is on 7.5 mg prednisolone. Has anyone else experienced this with Gca and Cataracts? Any advice welcome.

"Hi,
I have recently started using a prescription corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies. I know I will need this for at least 6 weeks (so much in bloom right now) and perhaps longer. Do you happen to know if there are issues with long term use of this when on prednisone?
I have been on prednisone about 15 months and am just getting down to the 5 mg level (again, after a relapse in December).
My doctor said there is no problem taking both (but he knows very little about PMR) and the pharmacist also assured me that I could take both (not sure if he fully realizes that I will probably be taking prednisone pills quite long term).
I am awaiting an appointment to an allergy doctor (probably about 3 month wait here in Canada) and I suspect I have an allergy to something like mold or dust as I have allergy symptoms year round now so there is a chance I will be on nasal spray a long time.
Spring is lovely here - but so much pollen in the air!

"I'm new here. My 83-year-old father has extreme weakness in both thighs (evenly) for the past 6 months. He does not have pain, only weakness. He has had stiffness in his neck sometimes and maybe a little pain, but not in the past 6 months. His family practice doctor thinks he has PMR and prescribed 15 mg prednisone per day. At first, it was a miracle and he felt SO MUCH BETTER. But when we try to cut back the prednisone even by 1 mg, he has setbacks (such as falling, extreme weakness). The m.d. sent my father to a rheumatologist. She says he definitely does NOT have PMR because he is has no symptoms in his upper body at all - his shoulders are not stiff or painful at all, he has full range of motion, and he has strength everywhere except his thighs. He can barely stand up. He has severe trouble getting up from a sitting position. He feels like he will fall even with a walker or cane. He also has P.A.D. (peripheral artery disease) and congestive heart failure. His primary m.d. still is convinced he has PMR because the Prednisone helps him so much. Does anyone else have PMR like this? Also, I notice when reading some of your stories you take a lot more than 15 mg per day. Maybe he needs a higher dosage. Right now his m.d. is sending him for a CT scan of his abdomen to view his arteries. If nothing is obviously wrong he's going to speak to the rheumatologist again - because he is so convinced it's PMR. Anyone else have a similar experience?

"I am male, 33 age, 95 kg of weight and had been suffering muscle spasm, body aches and joints and bones pain since November last year. Doctor diagnosed uric acid as it was 8.5 and gave me adenuric tablet for 15 days and that reduced my uric acid down but the pains and aches were slightly reduced and didn't go away. I started taking normal food and not the uric acid prohibited food and now my uric acid is 8.3 and same pains, spasm and aches specially in shoulders, blades, back side of neck, elbow and hip bones. All my other tests like CBC and RA factor and few others are normal and I met a rheumatologist and he examined me in detail and said its not the artheritis and its the uric acid issue. He suggested my uric acid tablet, vitamin A and vitamin D3 injection for drinking. In this whole episode of three months I tested myself for Vitamin D and it was 16. Now I am taking these medicines since last ten days except multivitamin mega man that the rheumatologist prescribed and my symptoms are same. Please advise what to do as I am really frustrated mentally. Please help what should I do

"Saw a new GP who is happy to do more frequent CRP blood tests. CRP from December was 25 CRP from 2 days ago was 23. GP has suggested doubling the pred from 10 mgms to 20 mgms then repeating CRP in a month. My question is if I start to feel better fairly quickly how long before I should start reducing the pred. I have type 11 diabetes and cataracts from the pred and I want to try to avoid further side effects from the increased dose. I will follow the protocols for reducing doses as per previous posts on the forum. I am looking forward to being awake all night!!!!
Eileen should I start a new post or just continue on from the original post if I have an update for the forum?
I saw a diabetic educator today who told me I needed to exercise and take off weight but this of course is a bit tricky if you have pain and fatigue issues. Looking forward to the day when this goes away.
Hope everyone is keeping well

"Hi,
I've just had my blood test results back and they show I have Polymyalgia Rheumatica. I don't think I have it as bad as some on here after reading up on everyone suffering. I'm in a lot of pain in my neck, shoulders and arms all the time but it's much worse at night. I'm not sleeping well because of the pain but I guess that's normal?
I have an apponintment on Monday at my doctors to see where I go from here but the last doc said it would be steroids. I'm really not keen on the idea of steroids as i'm already overweight and if I put even mor on that will bring it's own health issues.
Sorry i'm rambling now but it's good to find this forum with people who understand. Did anyone else worry about taking steroids?

Sorry to be a pain and I know I only asked about Aloe vera juice the other day, and thanks for all my replies I am not going to go down that route.

"Hi,
Having been put back on track by a new doctor (thank heavens for her!). I am on 15mg Pred and I have been signed off work for 3 weeks to give the steroid chance to work on my muscles. I have been forced to rest as I had a chest infection (every cloud etc.). So I have rested for a week and done very, very little.
I am in danger of becoming a couch potato as I am terrified of overdoing it too quickly and going downhill.
I had a feeling that someone gave a link to a paper or a site for the regime for PMR recovery. However I have just sent myself cross-eyed scrolling through all the discussions to find it. It was not all in vain as I picked up some valuable info/tips/laughs along the way. I am still giggling at Mrs K and her SAGA (Sex And Games for the Aged).
If anyone has any advice for me or can give me some links I would be very grateful.
Thanks

"Hi everyone, I haven't sent any messages since January as I have been so busy with work, family and pain.
I was diagnosed last year with PMR and at moment have managed to get down to 7mg of pred, but I also have to take two calcium tablets daily and 1 x alandronic(?) acid tablet on a sunday, the one where you have to sit up straight for an hour, I experience usually about Tuesday a bad tummy but the dr says that is probably the alandronic acid
I have been in so much pain when walking that my doctor advised for me to go for an MRI scan, which is showing wear and tear on my spine and problems with my sciatic nerve, which is probably causing the pain when walking - I can only walk for approx. 5 mins(sometimes not even that) and the pain is so bad I find it hard to lift my feet one in front of the other and I get breathless - surely at 56 I should be fitter than that. I also find that going upstairs can cause the burning sensation in my leg and I have to sit down for a few moments until it eases As for housework well....................... I really enjoy cleaning my house ( probably because it is such a change from when I am at work sitting at my desk all day) but I find after about 10 - 15 mins I have to sit for a few moments and then carry on if I can it is so frustrating. My doctor after the results of the scan has now put me on Co Codomol and I have to take 2 x 15mg tablets four times a day. I only started them yesterday and cant say there has been any difference yet in my pain.
I have also got the ""hamster"" face from taking the pred and have put on a lot weight around my stomach area, my doctor has now told me I have to go on a very low carb diet. He advises porridge in the morning and then for the rest of the day just either salad, fish, lean chicken and veg. I am to have no extra milk(he says I will get enough calcium from the tablets) and no bread, potatoes, pasta(don't like it anyway!) or rice.
I have my breakfast at 5.00am every morning so by 9.00am I am starving and then it just gets worse throughout the day - although oddly enough this morning I had porridge instead of my usual two slices of toast and so far I am not terribly hungry.
A friend of mine says she drinks between 60ml and 120 ml of aloe vera juice every day and she feels great - she hasn't got PMR or any illness for that matter but she says the juice helps with her weight loss and is entirely natural so shouldn't do me any harm. She also says it helps with inflammation.
Has any one else experienced this juice that has had PMR and was there any benefits to it?
I haven't posted any messages recently but I do read the discussions regularly and find them very helpful - especially from Eileen and Mrs O.
Take care everyone x

"I just wanted to say thanks to all who have posted on this site for the valuable advice and insight into this debilitating condition. I am 6 weeks on from my initial diagnosis which took 3 months before that to finally nail it down as PMR. I am 55 years old and an active netball player so other things had to be ruled out before we got there. I started on 15mg of pred and tomorrow will be reducing to 9mg for a month. So far each reduction of 2.5mg has gone smoothly so I am hopeful that this 1mg drop will be ok. I am also taking the weekly Alendronic acid, 2 daily calceos tablets, 2 spoonfuls of manuka honey 12+ active and a daily mini bottle of Yakult light. So far I have not had any serious stomach upsets so have not needed the Omeprazole.
I also have underactive thyroid and take 100mg Levothyroxine daily and need a B12 injection every 3 months. I consider myself very fortunate that the drugs are working well enough that I have been able to continue with netball. I am taking it easy and as I play GS there is no need for me to race about all over the place I can be fairly static.
I am also continuing to take my daily cod liver oil, glucosamine, omega 3 fish oil and odourless garlic capsules all to keep me creak free!
I realise that there is no quick fix and I'm in it for the long haul but considering how bad I was 2 or 3 months ago unable to get out of bed or the bath, creeping downstairs 1 step at a time, unable to dress or undress myself , I'm amazed at the improvement in a short space of time.

"I have PMR-GCA and have SEDs measured as high as 117 and CRP as high as 238.
I also am allergic to Simvastin and the pain I experienced with it was almost as debilitating as the pain associated with PMR. The statin allergy pain was AROUND my angle, knee and hip joints and I also experienced muscle stiffness in the calf, glutei and back. It took two years before this problem started to affect me. After it started to occur, I would wake up with the problems I listed above but was able to work it off after an hour of movement when getting ready for work. I discovered it was statin induced after leaving the stuff at home before one of my international trips and the pain went away!!

"I was diagnosed with PMR July 2012, with ESR 62, put on 15 mg Pred, 11 days passed before I was free of pain. 1 month later Doc reduced me to 10 mg. ESR then 10. Then later to 7.5mg and finally to 2mg by Oct 2013. Relapse started Dec 2013. Doc started to increase Pred. to 6mg.but pain persisted so Doc increased me in stages to 15mg, (pain persisted) so Doc said go to 20mg or even 30mg if pain still persists. Pain is persisting. Meanwhile, a full blood test was done and all came back normal, ESR now 12. Just to complicate matters, there was a moment 12 days ago when for 4 days I mixed up my tabs and was taking only 4 x 1mg, when I should have been taking 4 x 5mg. I am now on 3rd.day at 30mg. but pain still persists.Does anyone have any comments please?
The only other query on my mind is the fact that I was given a Pneumonia jab 3 weeks ago, could this play a part.?

"I had a steroid injection about five days ago - for shoulder impingement - and was told that some of the steroid would 'leak' out to the rest of the body, and temporarily reduce my PMR type symptoms elsewhere (though the rheumatologists are keeping an open mind as to whether it actually is PMR). This has certainly happened - I can walk for hours, no stiffness in morning: I feel like I did on 15mg sixteen months ago.
But my main question is, now that I'm on 6mg will this extra shot of steroid 'confuse' my body. And will it make more difficult to reduce once it wears off?

In February I started drinking vast amounts and passing vast amounts of urine sometimes every

same for at least 3 years.
But the most worrying symptom was a dramatic deterioration in my eyesight.I visited my
optometrist who did a thorough eyetest and I obtained new single vision spectacles but within 3 days of wearing them my eyesight deteriorated further and I felt weak and giddy.She suggested I might be diabetic as I didn't seem to have GCA as I had no symptoms of it. I got to my GP as
soon as possible and had an immediate blood test which confirmed type 2 diabetes with a
reading of 26.0.My last test in June had a reading of 6.1 .My diabetic nurse think my sudden spikeis due to steriod treatment. With medication my eyesight is now improving and I'm less
exhausted .Unfortunately my PMR symptoms are returning as I no longer take steriods.

"I wanted to post what I found on the Anti-inflammatory Diet on tomatoes. This is their summary:
""""Tomatoes, another nightshade veggie, may also help reduce inflammation in some people. (Of course, Dr. Zashin’s advice about what works for you, individually, applies here, as well.)
Juicy red tomatoes, specifically, are rich in lycopene, which has shown to reduce inflammation inthe lungs and throughout the body. Cooked tomatoes contain even more lycopene than raw ones, so tomato sauce works, too—and a 2012 Iranian study found that tomato juice consumption was also beneficial. """"

"Over the past three years, many people have joined this site and going back over past posts can be difficult.
No 1 - There is currently No known Cause or Cure. PMT comes when it wants and goes when it wants.
No 2 - This website is contains an International Survey on PMR and GCA
http://www.quantisurve.com/cgi-bin/pmr.asp it takes about 10 minutes to fill it in. The results are also available and it does enlighten you on some aspects.
No 3 - There is a National Charity called PMR-GCA UK and it will shortly be launched. In the meantime, this site contains the numbers of some support groups and also this website www.pmr-gca-northeast.org.uk. This has loads of current medical information on it and also the latest guidelines for the treatment of PMR (British Society of Rheumatologists) these guidelines are also on their own website and the NHS website.
There are also other articles, re exercise, steroids, Ragnar's drop down regime and people's stories - oh and a list of support groups.
No 4 - Steroids - these alleviate the pain and enable you to at the least maintain some quality of life. They do come with side effects, but not everybody gets them all. So far I have not come across anybody that has had all 82 of them.
No 5 - Learning to go with the flow and listen to your body is essential. This is one of the hardest things to learn as you have been active, busy and all of a sudden a ten ton truck, which you cannot see, has hit you.
It is hard to deal with these two illnesses - PMR and GCA.
This site is the best I have found so far, to ask the daft question, to ask if somebody else has tried this, to ask does someone know about this?
I hope the forgoing is of some help in pulling past strands together.
Good Luck and may your PMR take a short walk of a long pier soon.
In the meantime Knowledge is Power.

"Apologies to the site manager for length of message.
For what its worth, I have previously always used cut onions to remove the smell of paint when decorating.
This Year I am giving Onions a go to combat flu, colds etc. Nothing to lose.
\""In 1919, when the flu killed 40 million people, there was a Doctor who visited the many farmers to see if he could help them combat the flu. Many of the farmers and their family had contracted it and many died.
The doctor came upon this one farmer and, to his surprise, everyone was very healthy. When the doctor asked what the farmer was doing that was different, the wife replied she had placed an unpeeled onion in a dish in all the rooms of the home, (probably only two rooms back then). The doctor couldn't believe it and asked if he could have one of the onions and place it under the microscope. She gave him one and when he did this, he found the flu virus in the onion. It obviously had absorbed the bacteria, therefore, keeping the family healthy.
Now, I heard this story from my hairdresser in AZ. She said several years ago, many of her employees were coming down with the flu and so were many of her customers... The next year, she placed several bowls with onions in her shop. To her surprise, none of her staff got sick. It must work.. (And no, she is not in the onion business.)
The moral of the story is, buy some onions and place them in bowls around your home. If you work at a desk, place one or two in your office or under your desk or even on top somewhere. Try it and see what happens. We did it last year and we never got the flu.
If this prevents you and your loved ones from getting sick, all the better. If you do get the flu, it just might be a mild case..
Now, there is a P. S..... I sent this to a friend in Oregon, who regularly contributes material to me on health issues. She replied with this most interesting experience about onions:
I don't know about the farmers story...but, I do know I contracted pneumonia and, needless to say, I was very ill...I came across an article that said to cut both ends off an onion.. put one end on a fork and then place the forked end into an empty jar...placing the jar next to the sick patient at night. It said the onion would be black in the morning from the germs...sure enough.... it happened just like that...the onion was a mess and I began to feel better.
Another thing I read in the article was that onions and garlic placed around the room saved many from the black plague years ago. They have powerful antibacterial, antiseptic properties.
Whatever, what have you to lose? Just a few bucks for the onions\""
Well, after using Onions for years to combat the smell when painting and decorating - this year I have found a new use and am giving it a go. I have nothing to lose.

"Thank you so much for all your kind support. I will definitely seek another opinion to treat the symptoms of my PMR. I've had it for approximately one year; was started at 15 mg a day, which really cut the symptoms. The doctor tried to cut the dose by 5 mg a month but my body did not respond well to that so she changed it to a 1 mg reduction per month. When I got to 5 mg I felt sort of OK but not great and I thought if I could hold on the symptoms would abate. At that point the doctor checked my ESR which was 23 (normal range was something like 5-20) and she decided to take me down to 4mg last week. Bad idea! symptoms returned big time and I'm back on 5 mg and still feeling the stiffness. Funny thing is I'm sort of afraid to ask her if I could raise it back up to 6 or 7 mg. She keeps warning me of the ""bad"" effects of the pred. Seems like you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.
In any case, I feel much better knowing you're all out there in the real world of PMR (not happy that you have it) just glad that I can get your feedback as fellow sufferers. Also I just began the ""anti-inflammatory diet"" at least my version of it, after hearing how it has helped many of you.
Thanks again,

"I'm so glad that I've found this site. Living in the US I can see the doctor whenever I want (have insurance unlike so many others). Unfortunately the doctor seems to think that my inability to go under 5mg prednisolone a day is a failure on my part. I'm so glad to see that others suggest at least 6 months on 5mg before lowering the dose. My doctor wants to get me off all the steroids by the summer (as though it is some sort of race). I know the stuff has some horrible side effects but without them the soreness is unbearable.
Last evening, after complaining to my doctor that 4 mg seemed to cause a flare of my symptoms, she suggested changing my medicine to another anti-inflammatory drug (not sure of the name) which seems to be the one that causes some very nasty side effects. I'm thinking that I should just stay on the 5mg for a few more months and refuse to change to the other medication which sounds so dreadful.

"Hello,
I'm brand new to this forum and have recently be provisionally diagnosed with pmr.
I am 49 years old and have had fairly classic shoulder and more recently hip symptoms for 6 months. I have been on naproxen with some effect and high dose codeine at night. Diagnosis has been difficult because I am 'too young' and all my blood tests have been normal. Two weeks ago, however, I persuaded my G.P to try me on prednisolone as I had great difficulty walking, in constant severe pain and have been unable to work since July.
After 4 doses of 30mg pred I could lift both arms above my head, could walk normally and generally do much more. I no longer needed codeine every night. My pain was lessened and much more localised, responding to heat and rest (especially in my arms).
It is now 2 weeks since I started the steroids and whilst my mobility and pain are much better, I still have problems and am certainly not symptom-free. My arms are fairly good, with pain after I use them for general housework etc but tolerable. My right hip, however, can be very bad - I cant stand for too long and if I sit on a hard chair for any length of time the pain is awful for hours and I need codeine occassionally.
I had to reduce my dose to 25mg today as my GP instructed but am now very nervous. I've tried to stop the naproxen but went back on it after a few days. Can anyone relate to my experience, is this common? I thought the steroids would take all the pain away? I'm starting to panic because I need to get back to my demanding job soon or I will have my contract terminated.
Even with my improvement my GP was still dubious about the diagnosis, but I would say I am approx. 70-75% better, its just the last 30% that the issue. Am I expecting too much?
Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.
Happy New Year to you all.

"Oh Gosh. What a bad experience I had today with my first rheumy appointment.
I have normal markers but had really bad pains. Within 3 days of taking steroids apart from my hips I have no other pains.
Went to see a rheumy today who gave me a 10 min appointment pulled my arm twisted my neck and didn't take any notice that my blood pressure was 170/110. She told me that because my markers where normal she didn't know what I had and that I will have to come off the steroids 12.5mg tomorrow and bit by bit then stop them. She also gave me a blood test as long as a shopping list (all these test were done within the last few months all normal)
I have been in a constant pain in the past in my arms, shoulders, neck and unable to get out of a chair. Since the steroids my life is wonderful.
I have had some excellent advise from Mrs O Eileen and lovely people but what can you do when your GP is a new trainee and will take the side of a experienced rheumy. Several of GPs at the practice are sheep minded and all are on the side of high inflammation markers.
I cannot bear to return to pain. I am beginning to think that perhaps it is all in my mind!
Do you have any advise for me. Kind regards Jenny x

Spoke with my GP Thursday by phone (really good about knowing that I know my body and manage the condition and not asking for blood tests to prove anything) suggested 5mg until today and if no effect back up to 15mg!!!! Felt so rough agreed to whatever on Thursday and upped to 5mg. I am improved - stiffness reduced but still feel as though I've been weight lifting and the burning in my shoulders & tops of both arms. Very reluctant to go back to 15mg - any suggestions prior to speaking with GP. I only read the forum when struggling for advice (sorry guys)! Advice would be appreciated.

"Hello, I wonder if anyone could help me?
I am 51 and for a long time I had really bad pains in my neck, shoulders arms and back. These pains got so bad I was unable to move in bed or get out of a chair. Last month I went to my doctor and straight away she said that I had probably got PMR. She did blood tests and apart from anemia all results are normal. She wanted to start me on steroids but after consulting with other doctors said unless I had high blood markers she was unable to prescribe the medications. I went to see another doctor and she started me straight away on 15mg steroids. Within days apart from my lower back I am pain free!
My questions are does this sound like I have PMR or could the steroids be covering up another problem. Also if I do have PMR and need to stay on steroids for years, then how can my condition be monitored if I have normal markers? If taking the steroids and most of the pain has gone then why do you think my lower back still hurts? I am so glad the steroids have worked but are really fearful of taking them long term if I do not have PMR. I do hope someone on this site could help me. I feel my doctors don't know very much about this and to be honest do not really care.
I wish everyone who suffers from this dreadful condition love and a pain free life.

"Hi, I'm new to this website, and I like to know if it is normal to have your pains come back when you lower your prednisone ? I was on 12.5 mgs and went down to 10 mgs and experiencing pain in my left hip, shoulder, and hands. I was diagnosed 11 weeks ago with PMR. I started out with 15 mg mgs of prednisone. After 14 days, was lowered to 12.5 mgs and was told to go to 7.5 mgs was on that for three weeks and pains came back. I decided to try 10 mgs and I found out at that does the pains were still there. What I really like to know are you supposed to have pain when you reduce and for how long should it last.

"Hi, I'm 52 years old and have had rheumatoid arthritis for 22 years. I got a call from my RA doctor asking how I was feeling since my sed rate was 39 I believe. I had been having some back pain and reg RA pain but nothing too bad at the time. The pain seemed to get worse over the month of Dec. and I got in to see my family doctor the first week of Jan. He had me have more blood work done and a lung xray. Xray came back normal but bloodwork showed abnormal protein levels. So I was asked to have a serum protein electrophoresis test done to see if I possibly had multiple myeloma.
Also, the first week of January I started having very bad headaches. I don't usually get headaches so I was a bit concerned that the headaches kept coming back (still having them every day but not as bad)
Ok, now before all this happened, I had been decreasing my RA meds so I'm assuming that's why I had a higher sed rate than I usually have. So before I went in to have the serum protein electrophoresis blood test, I took 2 weeks where I took all RA meds that were prescribed to me to see if that would help with my other monthly bloodwork.
So today I went to my family doc as a follow up app't and to see what the results of the bloodwork had been. Was told that it wasn't multiple myeloma. Then I mentioned the symptoms I've been having like the headaches(pain across forehead and temple area), Blurry vision in left eye (right eye seems fine)...as I'm telling him the symptoms, he said no, it can't be polymyalgia rheumatica or GCA because my bloodwork (5 days ago) showed my sed rate at 14. He said it would be much higher like in the 80's to even be considered GCA. Is that true?

Blood tests have bin organised for this week too. My doc told me i did not have it wit sum certainty I'm too young nd he was willing to bet his mortgage on it.
Symptoms include blurred vision which has occurred since before Xmas (last month or so). Pain in
the elbow joints with pins and needles (particularly bad at night) Jaw ache when eating chewy foods. Dull headaches sumtimes severe. The veins In my temples seem slightly tender. Yu cant see them to look but to touch yu can. Last year had a period of excessive sweating. Rele bad dint have to do much for it to come on either. Lean over the car bonnet for two mins and back is killing me. And pain in lower stomach first suspected it was ibs. But now not sure unless it's related.

"Can,t find my original forum where Eileen and Mrs O were so knowledgable and helpful a year ago when PMR diagnosed.
I am down to 5 mg pred and last 2 nights of taking (I still take with supper and not breakfast) I have developed a red slightly lumpy rash on most parts of my body, not face, yet,
The only thing I can think of is the last batch of tablets started 2 days ago were from a different pharmaceutical company.
Tonight I will take 5 1mg tabs rather than the new 5mg and see if it makes a difference.
The rash is still with me this morning unlike yesterday when it went and is hot itchy and I feel slightly sick.
Has anyone out there anything similar happen. I was doing so well being down to 5 mg although many hiccups on the way.

"I am a new ""victim"" of PMR, and am confused over some of the terminology I read about, especially when it comes to the dose of cortisone. Ideally one should get to as low a dose as possible to where the PMR is ""manageable"". But what is manageable? Does that mean that you still feel it a bit but can function quite normally or does that mean that you hardly ( or not at all ) feel the symptoms?
Is "" manageable"" a personal perspective ?

My ESR levels plateaued and my levels are staying at 29 ( this was after a three day course of pred at 35mgs). My Doctor has put me back up to 10mgs which has helped but is not perfect. Apart from my weight, which is another issue, my most frightening side effect at the minute is the fact that I cannot walk any great distance without pain and the inability to lift my feet very far off the ground. Is this normal? Has anybody else had this issue? I am 55 year old and have always been active so this is so frustrating. Even cleaning he house can leave me breathless and in pain to the point I have no choice but to sit down for a while.

I get to the gym each day and cycle at a high intensity for 45-50 minutes. Today my specialist suggested I a take methotrexate and the stiffness I am having at the moment would likely leave plus my CRP which is at 25 would improve. My CRP was 18 in December.

"Hi,
I am a 48 year old male living in Canada.
In approx. July of this year I began to experience extreme tightness and pain in both hamstrings, and my neck.
I assumed it was related to the extensive exercise I had been doing (Crossfit - Weightlifting and High Intensity Interval Training). However, the pain would not subside with rest, and eventually spread to my shoulders. Currently, the pain occurs at varying intensities (worse in the morning) on a daily basis and continues to affect my pelvic, upper legs, shoulders and neck. Some days are not too bad, other days are worse, but still not as bad as many of the experiences I have read on this site and others.
My GP believes this is PMR, but wants me to see a rheumatologist to confirm. All I know at this point from the tests is that my CRP is around 12 or 13. Unfortunately It looks like I won't be able to see a rheumatologist until April, unless my GP can pull a few strings.
I have been dealing with this by often taking 400mg of ibuprofen at about 2am, which seems to relieve the pain somewhat in the morning.
If the pain I currently experience did not get worse, I could possibly live with this and hope that it goes away without taking prednisone. However, I don't want to continue taking 400mg of ibuprofen on a daily(nightly) basis.
Questions:
1) Is there any evidence to suggest that taking prednisone will cause the PMR to go into remission any sooner or later with or without treatment? My GP suggeted that prednisone shortens the duration, but that's not what I get from the research I have done.
2) I there any info on whether symptoms may get worse or better over time without treatment?
FYI, I am aware of the link to GCA, my GP doesn't seem concerned about this. He also says his experience is that most of his patients only need to take prednisone for 6 months to a year.

"Me again,
Previous posts have outlined that fact that I have been suffering PMR type symptoms since July 2013 , but because I am slightly younger than 50 (by less than two years), my rheumatologist is very reluctant to diagnose PMR to and to avoid long-term prednisone treatment until all other potential causes are ruled out. I have since been referred ot a neurologist.
Last summer, prior to any PMR-like symptoms, I had pain in my neck which appeared to be related to inflammation of the carotid artery. I have little doubt this inflammation is related to my PMR -like symptoms. The pain went away in about a week. At the time, after mentioning it to my GP, I had an ultrasound which showed nothing unusual
I have told my rheumatologist about this event. The reason I bring it up is that today I seem to be experiencing this again. Not constant pain, but the area is a little tender to the touch. I also have a bit of a sore neck today ( as it is some days). and a bit of a cold, so the symptoms could be related to either of those. When I experienced it previously, the pain would go away with a small dose Tylenol.
If is sticks around another day or so, I will be contacting my doctor as I am concerned about a possible relationship to GCA. I currently have no other symptoms I could relate to GCA.
Curious if any others have experienced this.

"A week or 2 before Xmas I got a cold, chest and sinus infection that has taken till now to get over. But over that time I seem to now get every few days a weakness in my thighs, together with aching, that will last a day and then go. Also seem to be getting more woozy spells on standing (low blood pressure?) which include one arm going temporarily dead.
Since my diagnosis end Oct and meds of 30mg pred I consider myself to be very fortunate in how well controlled the pmr has been, considering how bad a state I had got into before taking the pred - and I will start a gradual reduction this month.
But don't know whether this problem is connected to the pmr or something else. Because the pred has been so effective I do sometimes forget that this is a condition to manage rather than one sorted - overdoing it is not recommended! But I don't know where this wobbly weakness is coming from.
Any ideas anyone?

"Hi from Australia. Have started reading this forum today and I really like what I have read so far.Diagnosed with PMR March 2013 but had symptoms starting as far back as 2011. I am 62 years old.
Have been on and off the prednisone due to difficulty coming to terms with the diagnosis( am a nurse) and having side effects with the prednisone. SOB, weight gain of 20kgs, Diabetes Type 2, sleep difficulties and now have cataracts. I see aPhysician (not a Rheumatologist) who wants me to basically get down to 7.5 mgs as he considers this to be a safe dose. Saw him 3 weeks ago and was recommended I go back up to 12.5mgms to get symptoms better controlled then reduce by 2.5mgms every week. On reading the some of the discussions it would appear this is too much too soon and I think I maybe one of those people who are very sensitive to reducing doses of the Pred. I asked him about taking the Pred at night and he said no but Isee that your recommendation is 2am which I am happy to go with. I have had togive up work due to the PMR but feel this has been a good thing as I was pushing myself and was becoming very fatigued. Both my GP and Physician have allowed me to alter my pred doses but I probably need some guidance from your forum to steer me in the right direction. Where do I go to get dietary advice.
Thank You for your help. This is a great Forum for silly billies like me who as a nurse think they know it all then fall flat on their face.

"I am so delighted to have found a site that I can follow other patients with PMR, like myself, and to be able to follow your diets and comments. I am 68 yrs old, and diagnosed with PMR just recently
in August 2013. My symptoms started overnight - so weird that I just did not know what happened. Went to bed feeling fine,and woke up that I could barely get out of bed with pain in my whole body and my legs. I thought I must have slept wrong.... but as the days went by, it continued day after
day for almost 2 weeks (taking Advil with not much help), went to see doctor. Explaining to him my symptoms, he saw that I had eczema in my elbows and asked me ""how long"" have I had thiscondition. I have had eczema issues since I was a child - and had NO IDEA that PMR is related to this, as you get older. He told me, ""he was almost sure he knew what my condition was"", ran a lot of blood work and 2 days later told me I had contracted PMR. I never heard of this illness before
(and I am in the medical field). He put me on 20 mg Prednisone and for the past 4 months have been weaned down to 10mg, (however 3 weeks ago, my symptoms returned so now I am back to 20 mg again). He says maybe we went down too quickly.
Reading your stories about stress related to PMR, let me tell you: Over a year ago, out of the blue, I started a series of ""panic attacks"" where I had to be put on B/P medicine and experienced some anxiety - all stress related to my job.... Now looking back, I do think definitely Stress issues in your body must wreck havoc and must have started my PMR condition.
I am so glad to have found you all - and to read your way of improving ourselves to get better. We are all in the same situation and I thank you for your suggestions. I do try to eat a lot of vegetables and fruits, oranges seem to agree with me -I take one in the mornings. Also I happen to love tomatoes, I did not know they were bad.I will go in the website and see what foods are anti-inflammatory
Thank You all so much....

I have since been referred ot a rheumatologist.
To manage pain and stiffness, I had been taking 800mg of ibuprofen at aprox. 1 or 2am every morning. I believe this helps. After my last visit my doctor told me to switch to Tylenol to avoid ibuprofen side effects. I decided to go without any pain relievers to test out what the effect would be.
I went tuesday to Friday wiothout any pain relievers. The result was that my pain and stiffness was off the charts compared to what it had been. My glutes were so painfull that walking was a struggle. On Sunday morning I decided to take 800mg of Ibuprofen - the improvement was dramatic, and I could function much better and was in far less pain. I must also mention that starting last Wednesday I began to take about 6-10ml of Turmeric drops and started eating fish oil capsules daily, also taking large amounts of vitamin D , and potassium supplements. Perhaps this has had some impact (I hope).
Anyway, I realize that I have not been diagnosed with PMR at this point, though I strongly believe that is what I am dealing with, and that NSAIDS are said to be ineffective in dealing with this. It seems to me that my taking them early in the morning does have beneficial impact on what ever I am going through.
Just my two cents on the NSAID effectiveness topic.

"1st post, so please be gentle!
My 67 year old Mother is currently in hospital awaiting a diagnosis for 'weakness' in the muscles in arms & legs which has appeared in the last 10 days or so. The doctors (including seemingly several neurologists) seem to be unable to make up their minds as to whether the issue is PMR or Guillane-Barre Syndrome.
The latest neurologist seems to suspect PMR but I'm doubtful. Everything I've read about PMR states that it's painful! She has no pain in shoulders, hips, knees etc (apart from after a lumber puncture!)
All tests so far have been inconclusive, and I am aware that PMR can sometimes show little blood changes. She's been in hospital for 5 days so far, and I think we are up to the 7th switch between the two (including one in ten minutes today!).
So, my question to you lovely people is whether you can have PMR WITHOUT pain?
Many thanks

"Hi all. I was diagnosed with PMR just after my mother died back in 2010. I found this site and reading the topics posted by the PMR community were a great help throughout this dreadful illness right up until I finally finished taking the steroids last year when I was officially cleared of PMR at last. I generally feel very well and can now move normally and I am free of pain for 99% of the time. However, I still do get the odd 'bad day' where my shoulders and knees are a little stiff and sore. But not that much as to affect my lifestyle. Also I am quite stiff most mornings when I get out of bed. Although I am fine within about 10 minutes of getting up.
It has been said that PMR does go away completely eventually. But I am now wondering in my case whether if it has? And as I mentioned, I am taking no steroids. But if the PMR has gone away completely should I be completely free of aches and pains?

"My 87 year old Mother had Polymyalgia 3 or 4 years ago and was on steroids for about a year. It went away completely.
Over the last 2 or 3 weeks she's had really bad ""electric shock"" tingling in her right arm, from the ""funny bone"" down to her hand and her fingers feel a bit numb. It's worse in the mornings but it hursts her whenever she puts pressure on her hand, eg using a knife to cut her food or turning a knob on the cooker.
She's seen the doctor who checked her neck and tapped the nerves in her wrist and thought it would just go away over time, but it seems to be getting worse. I'm a bit worried as, with Christmas approaching, it's virtually impossible to get her back to the doctor for the next few days.
Does anyone have any thoughts please? It's very different from the shoulder and arm pain she had witht the polymyalgia before but could it possibly be a recurrence of that?
Thanks all.

"I am new to this site and find reading other patients' reports both comforing and helpful.
I have had PMR for ten years but was not diagnosed early. A Rheumatologist put me on 20 mg Pred and the effect was miraculous. As I gradually lessened the dose, the aching began a little. However, I was apprehensive of being on steroids and wanted desperately to lose weight - so I reduced the amount of Pred until I was off it over 2 years.
Since then I have been up and down - returning twice to steroids for relief. My doctor won't prescribe the higher dose so have been on 7.5mg reducing to 2mg which I am on now.
Recently the Polymyalgia seems to be shifting its attacks from lower back to right leg and now to my shoulder. Can anyone else tell me if physiotherapy or accupuncture will alleviate the pain?
For the first time I feel very worried because I have a new little grandchild who I love looking after whenever I am needed. Of all times to be unable to use my arm freely, this is the worst!
I hope to start physiotherapy soon and am looking into acupuncture. I wonder whether trying so hard to stay off steroids is sensible in the end? Would welcome any comments and thank everybody out there to whom I send my best wishes for their own recovery.

"My mum was diagnosed with PMR a few months ago. I have found the posts on this site very informative, and I would very much appreciate any suggestions you may have to help my mum, who is feeling very unwell indeed at the moment.
Although mum has had the more typical symptoms of PMR, such a extreme fatigue and originally some shoulder pain, a feature of her illness seems to be loss of appetite, her food tasting 'synthetic' and frequent reflux, where her food won't go down, and comes back up. She has lost more than 3 stone in weight over the past year, and has become very weak as a result. This usually gets worse as the day goes on, and she feels much better with an empty stomach.
Mum did have some problems with her stomach over the year or two leading up to her PMR diagnosis, and had terrible vomitting over two prolonged periods when she had to take antibiotics. At that time the hospital said she had a hiatus hernia, although when mum has mentioned this to her GP he has not suggested any investigation or treatment for this.
She has tried various medications for the 'reflux' as she calls it, including one the the GP said would push her food through her, but these made her feel very nauseus and she could not continue. She does take Omaprezole twice daily without problems.
When she started taking prednisone, she did not notice the dramatic improvement she had hoped for although her ESR plummeted. There was a gradual improvement in her fatigue and appetite over about three months. Then the GP reduced her dose. At 10mg she seemed to be OK, but then when she was reduced to 9mg about a month ago the eating difficulties came back. She was reduced to 8mg last week and has gone significantly downhill with regard to her ability to keep food down, and the fatigue has increased along with a general feeling of being unwell. Today, for example, all she has managed to keep down is a build-up drink, and everything else she has tried to eat has not stayed down. There are very limited things that she can tollerate, mainly milk and banana, sometimes a little porridge or a build-up drink.
The GP seems unsure as to what the problem is with Mum's digestive problem. I'm so worried about her as she is feeling very unwell indeed at the moment and her weight loss is continuing steadily.
I have come up with some possible causes: hiatus hernia, prednisone withdrawal, PMR relapse. It would be great to hear whether anyone else has had similar symptoms and what caused them.
I am going to the GP with mum on Thursday, and some pointers as to what we should be asking would also be much appreciated.
Thank you very much.

I have to have bloods taken next week as doctor thinks I may have PMR. Thing is, I'm pretty sure I do.
I have had neck, shoulder, back and hip pain for I reckon a good couple of years now. But last fee months it's agony getting out of bed. Hurts to raise my arms and shifting sides in bed during the night is wicked. Funny thing is, I feel better for a couple of hours about 30 minutes after getting up in the morning.
I also get nasty head pains and an awful pain and ache in one of my temples and have had for around 6 years now! So much do that I had s ct brain scan from which the consultant said it was migraine. No way. I get migraines every month on the other side of my head which I'd more of a throb so wasn't sure about that diagnosis.

I'm just so down with this constant every day pain. And I hav. Never Beenon steroids so am a bit scared to say the least,
Any comforting words gratefully received

"Hello
My wife has been diagnosed with PMR. She is a couple of months into the steroid treatment regime - 15mg for 4 weeks, followed by 12.5 for 4 weeks.
When she was on 15mg, she was really good - had very few symptoms. The reduction to 12.5 brought a little pain. She's always been quite active and the enforced ""rest"" she had during the early days of the condition (where she couldn't get out of bed some days) is frustrating her and she went to a zumba class a few days ago.
The day after the zumba class was the day when the dose went down to 10mg. The day after that she had a HUGE relapse with pain levels back to where they were pre-treatment and perhaps even worse.
She has put the dose back to 12.5mg but that's not entirely successful at eliminating the pain. This morning her joints are swollen and she's in quite severe pain.
So my questions are:
1. Is the zumba likely to have caused or contributed to this?
2. Is it unusual to have relapses this severe so early on? We've read lots about people having relapses when they're on 5 or so milligrams, but never on 10/12.5!
3. She's going to put herself back to 15mg for at least a week - are there any problems doing this?
It's difficult to know what to do - her treatment has been organised by a consultant and we're not due to see him again for a few weeks.
Your help and advice will be very much appreciated - thank you

"I was diagnosed with PMR in September 2006 after several months and many visits to my GP. I am desperate to know WHY & HOW I got PMR but I guess I might never know the answer. During the months leading up to my diagnosis there were several things which may have caused or contributed to the condition. Firstly, I was prescribed statins for high cholesterol and I discarded these after just 4 weeks as I was feeling strange. Next, I stopped smoking. I'd been a twenty per day person for many years, stopping must have been a shock to my system. Then I went to Peru, and although I had a wonderful time, the altitude affected me badly. Finally, I joined a gym and began exercising my poorly muscles without knowing they were poorly. My first symptoms were quite mild, ie tingling down my arms and into my hands, also my veins would swell and darken, almost black ( has anyone else experienced this?) Then the pain started, first in my thighs and hips, then moving around to my arms, hands ( not shoulders or neck) I couldn't walk very well and had to lift my legs in and out of the car and bed. Also, I found fatigue and depression were creeping in. My legs are dead when climbing stairs or with any kind of excercise, I can't even vacuum the lounge without my hair being wet with sweat. I started on 30mg of steroids as my ERS reading was 66. Now I'm down to 9 1/2 mg and hoping to reduce soon. I would like to stop the steroids and graduallly replace them with pain killers. Which pain killers work best with the least side effects? I'm depressingly fat with a double chin and huge midrif. Nothing from last year fits me! I have insomnia and sometimes I'm aggressive on the steroids, I MUST get off them. I go to the gym regularly for aquafit. When I'm in the water I feel like I've got my body back, also I feel much better after an aquafit class, highly recommended for PMR. I also walk on the flat for 2 miles twice per week and have recently started pilates. My gym has recently acquired a \""power plate\"" which is a large vibrating plate which excercises your muscles for you. It is reputed to be good for many things including circulation and building bone etc. I've only been using it for 4 weeks but I will report on my findings in relation to PMR in the future. I go to a reflexologist regularly and take Devil's claw (Harpagophytum) for its anti inflammatory qualities. I believe I'm doing all I can to keep my muscles toned while I have this condition. If anyone has any further ideas or suggestions I'd love to hear. But is there ANYONE out there who has beaten this and returned to normal? I'm trying hard to remain positive but after all I've swallowed, undertaken, paid for, researched etc I sometimes feel hopeless about my future. I look like I'm carrying on with my life much the same as usual. I do most of the things I did before, though at my own pace and people can see I've gained weight but don't know I have this illness. The way I FEEL is like a tired and depressed 80 year old ( I'm only 60) and I was fit and energetic before this hit me. Good luck to all you sufferers out there and thanks for reading my moans. Can we form a group to press for more research into PMR? To know a cause would be wonderful but a cure would be even better or even an alternative treatment to steroids

"Varicose veins have been a nuisance for many years and since taking the steroid path (predisolone for PMR recently), ankles and legs have swollen first thing in morning .Medium support tights are donned ASAP on getting up and I keep on the move and raise my legs when sitting - if possible.

"I live in the UK and three weeks ago started prednisolone treatment for PMR. As I would soon be starting a five month trip to Australia and New Zealand, my GP was reluctant to start me on too high a dose, as I would not be easy to monitor. After less than two weeks my ESR rate was down to 25 from 47 and I felt human again, but I still had shoulder and arm pain for much of the time. The dose was increased to 12.5mg and after a week the arm and shoulder pain has reduced further but not disappeared. Should I aim to be completely pain free? I need help with deciding whether to:
-stick with the schedule agreed with my GP which is 12.5mg for three weeks, stepping down by 2.5 mg every four weeks till I return to the UK on 2.5mg
-wait for the agreed two more weeks on 12.5 and if there is still pain, increase to 15mg and then decrease again as agreed
-increase to 15mg straight away for three weeks, then reduce as agreed.
Thanks in advance.

"I''ve been diagnosed with PMR for over 2 months. Taking prednisone for 3 days reduced the hip and shoulder pain. I continued at 15 mg for over a month. Over the past 3 weeks I've been getting bad wrist and knee pain in the mornings. It could be because I reduced the prednisone from 15mg to 12.5 for 2 days. But increasing to 15 and then 17.5 and 20 for 2 days has not reduced the pain. I'm wondering if the wrist and knee pain could be a side affect of taking prednisone. I would appreciate your thoughts.

"I have had it for 4+ years and find it necessary to increase my dosage from 5 to ten and sometimes 15 mg prednisone. If I don't then the symtoms return. What I have read indicates that PMR goes away after 2 or 3 years, with some lasting apparently, indefinitely. When I was first diagnosed, I could hardly walk or dress myself. I lost 18lbs and was terribly depressed. When I broke down in my doctor office and cried I was admitted into the hospital. My doctor in conference with all the doctors in his practice suspected PMR and gave me a large dose of Prednisone. Within 4-5 hrs. I was able to click my heels, not so easy for a 64 year old man. Any hope of me ever getting rid of this?

"I am posting in desperation on behalf of my mother. She is 72 and was recently prescribed alendronic acid, as a preventative measure (her bone density is fine, she does not have osteoporosis) because she takes steroids for polymyalgia rheumatica.
Before taking the alendronic acid her mobility was fine, she was able to spend a day out walking around, do shopping etc. She took 3 tablets, one each week, and after the first she started experiencing pain deep in her buttock, which radiated down her leg. After the second the pain became more severe, and she was finding it hard to walk for any length of time. After the third she started using walking sticks to walk anywhere, even from room to room. She then stopped taking the alendronic acid, realising it must be this that caused the pain. She took her last one about a month ago and still has severe pain in one leg, so bad she is unable to sleep much at night, cannot stand up for any length of time, and is unable to walk very far. She is effectively housebound/wheelchair bound, after having been perfectly fine before.
None of the doctors she has seen have been able to help - she is on codeine and paracetemol 3x a day and gabapentin. The only other thing the docs have offered is sleeping tablets but she is reluctant to take them even though she is desperate to be able to escape the pain and sleep!
Can anyone offer us any hope at all? Any idea how long this poison takes to get out of the system? Anything she can do to help relieve the pain? Please help!

"Hi everyone,
I have been a regular migraine sufferer for 34 years, averaging about one per week. I've been on prednisolone 15mg for a few weeks now for PMR, and not the slightest hint of a migraine.

Anyone else had the same experience?

"I am relatively young to have this was 58 when diagnosed and have had polymyalga for one and half years. Have had quite a few ups and downs but prenisolone gave almost instant relief. I am down to 5mg per day and some days take pain killers. I manage to work almost full time look after my grandchildren and pretty well life goes on as normal. I have tried to reduce steroid below 5mg but am always unwell and have to go back to 5mg. I have been told this goes on for 2-3 years so for now will plod on. I can honestly say this illness has not dramatically affected my life (providing I take the steroids). Keep positive it is not all doom and gloom although saying that I am sure there are degrees of this illness. The most anoying thing is because you look alright people do not realise the pain that you are in. Keep you chin up and try to carry on as normal.

"Greetings all
I was diagnosed with GCA at the age of 62, like my mother was. Unlike her I was very lucky and did not develop PMR as well, and doctors had learnt not to overdo the steroids quite so much. I was offered alendronic acid to counteract the steroid bone thinning but decided not after checking it out further - inspired by noticing a pile of PR material about it on the doctor's desk. After 3 years on the steroids my muscles and tendons were all weakened and I had frequent issues with my knees; I also developed cataracts in both eyes; I don't know how my bone density is as decided not to have another DEXA scan.
Until about a year ago I was on a very low dose of prednisolone and having continuing occasional jaw, temple, and scalp unpleasantness. Because my erithrocyte levels were low I was discharged from the Rheumatoid dept and came off the steroids despite these continuing slight symptoms and have only had two clear relapses since, both minor but definite - including a spell of zero energy, loss of appetite and malaise. On both those occasions I found that taking just one 5mg steroid tab for two days was completely effective.
I do sometimes have minor symptoms/indications of the GCA if I forget to take my daily self-prescribed dose of Uncaria Tomentosa, also known as Cat's Claw. When I forget to take it I am reminded, usually by temple pain which goes within half an hour of taking the capsules. In case anyone here thinks this is crazy, they should check this drug out on medline - there is a growing body of research on it in many areas and it has an extrermely positive profile, notably but not solely as an anti-inflammatory, with minimal adverse effects. No reason to think it actually strengthens bones, but at least it doesn't weaken them (the reason peope with PMA and GCA tend to be prescribed alendronic acid is to counteract that notable steroid effect).So, I just thought this account might be of interest to people here - it would be wonderful to see some serious research with Cat's Claw in this specific area but I don't know how to influence that except by telling people here. All suggestions welcome.

"Hi everyone, I wondered if anyone could give me any input on having bursitis alongside PMR? I tried searching for bursitis using the search function but it brought up loads of posts on other forums which don’t help at all.
My story so far is that after 6 months of suffering I started on Prednisone about 6 weeks ago and reacted in classic PMR fashion, namely that about 75% of the pain disappeared practically overnight and then continued to reduce ever so slightly over the following 6 weeks. The pain I still have left is mainly in my left thigh (hip and thigh bursae), particularly after walking for a long time. Nowhere near as painful as before (I had really bad pain 24hr in both knees, both hips and both shoulders) and not painful at all at night, but a bit of a nuisance and worrying all the same.
Saw my doctor on Thursday and told him all this, and he told me this is all par for the course, and he wants me to start reducing gradually while doing specific exercises to combat what he has diagnosed as trochanteric bursitis in addition to the PMR, but to let him know immediately if the pain of the PMR comes back (I have great faith in him by the way – unlike the first 3 doctors I saw when all this started!). I cut my dose from 15 to 12.5 on Saturday, and have duly been doing my exercises from the exercise sheet he gave me this weekend, and also ventured on quite a long walk yesterday because it was such a beautiful day – trying to take it easy as he has told me to, but I was enjoying it so much I may have overdone it… Anyway today my left thigh is hurting quite badly where the main bursa is located, and I am wondering if it’s just because I have started with my exercises and walking and it is perfectly normal for it to feel a bit delicate, or if it is the PMR pain raising its ugly head because of the reduction in prednisone dosage and I should ring my doctor...
Bit more background about me in case it sheds any light – I’m 51 going on 52 and 2 years into menopause, but am on HRT. I have also had Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis (hypothyroidism) since 2006 so also take 100mg of thyroxine daily, along with the prednisone and calcium.
Has anybody else had this PMR bursitis combo? There seems to be an awful lot about PMR and bursitis on the internet but they don’t seem to be mentioned together, as if they are always two completely separate things. I meant to ask my doc about the specifics, but clean forgot. Would love to hear about anyone’s experiences, opinions or ideas!
Thanks for reading!

"My 83 yr mum diagnosed early 2013 with Polymyalgia. Responded to initial pred dose of 40mg dropped to 30mg after a week and gradually reduced to 20mg Then 8 weeks ago, she had very painful left hip/thigh pain which she did not think was related. Good osteo helped and it went, but 2 weeks ago had similar on right side diagnosed as pos trochanteric bursitis. Dr ordered xray but results not in yet & gave steroid injection with no relief. This pain is much much worse. She had started to reduce from 20 to 15mg. Dr not terribly helpful & said she knows how to handle her dosage ! On reading some forums, I'm wondering if this trochanteric pain means her PM is active and she needs to up her dose of pred. She has high pain threshold, cares for my 96 yr dad & was very active, but this is excrutiating. Any thoughts gratefully received.

"Hello all. I wonder if some of you would be kind enough to assist me...in getting out of the hole I have dug for myself. I am a 57 year old male. Diagnosed with PMR in dec 2010. I was initially put on 40mg of steroid and felt great in a few days. Sadly I did not know the side effects of steroids at that time. To cut a very long story short.. I now have osteoporosis (hips -0.8 and lower back -2.9) and have been on a maintenance dose of steroids of 10mg per day for last year or so. As I didn't want the osteoporosis to get worse and I didn't like the weight gain of pred.. I self reduced the steroids by 1mg per every 2 weeks. It took 5months to come down to zero. At every reduction the pain, stiffness and aches began to return..but my strategy was that my body would adjust and my body would also start to produce its own cortisol. I have been on zero pred for 4weeks now.. And sadly my body is close to seizing up!! I have terrible pain and stiffness in my hips, groins, lowerbback, legs, and left shoulder. Not sure if the left shoulder is PMR or a frozen shoulder as that is so painful and I can't move the arm up or to the side or up the back..
My dilemma is this... I so want to stay off of steroids but my quality of life is so awful now.. Do you think that if I just took 5mg of pred daily that the benefit to my body would be immediate and also the side effects minimal. I have to decide whether to give in and go back on pred..or whether to try to ride it out and hope the PMR burns itself out quickly. My rheumatologist said that PMR can go in 3 years or so. I have not seen the rheumatologist for over 9 months as there was nothing he could really do. I did try methotrexate for three weeks but it made me so sick so gave that up and stuck to steroids. Also can't go to GP to discuss as he was very off with me last time I saw him a few months ago when I asked him is there an alternative to pred without the side effects. I think I read somewhere that there was a new drug on the market (not yet authorised by NICE) that could produce cortisol in the body. The G P was very dismissive of me and said he had not heard of any alternative. I didn't tell him I had just come off the pred.
Sorry to trouble you on this.. But I am feeling terrible now.. And don't have anyone to speak to on this. The depression feel is coming back also as I feel so rough.
Thank you very much for reading this.

"Hi all. I have been a member of this forum since 2011 when I was first diagnosed with PMR. I have not posted for a while as basically I just quietly carried on with the medication and regular blood tests and continued to improve.
Now, according to my GP I am all but cured. Over the past 2 years I have been successfully gradually reducing my steroids, and before Christmas I got down to just 1mg a day dosage and generally feeling well.
Now my GP has instructed me to cease taking the steroids the completely, along with the monthly GP visits and blood tests, which is wonderful! However, during the past couple of weeks I have developed a nasty pain on the side of my left leg right at the top .I have had this pain before during my PMR years, but it is now very troublesome during the night and disturbs my sleep. I am now wondering if it is the PMR returning and that I should go back on the steroids? I would hate to have gone this far with my recovery and it all to have been in vain. However, this pain doesn't actually feel the same as PMR pain, it is more of a dull ache.
Could it be something else and totally unconnected? Do I need to go back to my GP and get another blood test?
Advice on this would be appreciated.

"Hi,
I am from Australia, and I am in the 23rd month of my PMR. I am now 60 years old. This forum has been more help and reassurance to me than any other site I have looked at.
I have been llike many others - spent ages on 10 mg, then ages on 5 mg, thinking I would never decrease any more, but at last it is starting to burn itself out now.
I have been dereasing 0.5 mg at a time over weeks and weeks, and now I'm at 3mg, and ready to drop to 2.5 mg. However, I am suddenly finding myself feeling very tired and exhausted. Fatigue has always been one of the symptoms that affected me a lot, but it was getting better. Now, although my aches and pains have reduced to a bearable level, the fatigue is really kicking in.
I am wondering if my adrenal glands are perhaps a bit tardy in making up for the reduced prednisone dosage. I understand that 10mg of prednisone is about the same as our body's natural cortisone levels, and I just expected that any lowering after that would be fine if it was done very very slowly - which is what i have done. It's been just fine until I got to 3mg.
Does anyone have any suggestions as to what it could be? Maybe I just have to get through this, and I might have to stay with 3 mg for a few weeks more to let my body get used to it.
On an interesting note: My PMR started with a stiff neck and shoulder pain which gradually sprerad to my upper arms and legs. Then it worked down my arms and legs to my elbows and knees and calf muscles, and my neck was OK. Now that it is getting better, it's following the same path in reverse - my arms and legs are getting better, and the sorest part of my body is my neck, where it started. I think PMR is an insidious animal with an agenda all of its own !!

Still hurting a bit, but bearable, and I can walk stairs and pick up objects from the floor, Not in an elegant way though.... :S

"My Dad who is 72 has been diagnosed with PMR just before Christmas and was put on 20mg of steroids. Before this he had been in so much pain for about 3 months, the family thought he was dying to be honest. Although the pain quickly subsided within days of taking the steroids his personality has changed. He has become manic, talking non stop, repeating stories over and over. Then last night he was talking to himself for at least 20 minutes, having a proper conversation with nobody there. If you try and tell him, ""Dad you have just told me that"", he becomes really aggressive. When he calms down he apologizes. He is also taking things apart to clean, but doesn't know how to put them back again. He says everything is dirty. The doctor has reduced his medication to 10mg but he doesn't seem to be getting any better. He will just fly into a rage over the silliest of things. I just wanted to know if anyone else has had these symptoms? I don't want him in pain but I don't know how we can cope with him like this. He's also not sleeping very well at all, he was awake for 48 hours before we convinced him to go to the doctor and get sleeping tablets.

"I asked my Doctor for a DEXA scan and as I seemed to tick all the boxes she sent the necessary forms off for me. When the letter arrived to arrange the appointment I was surprised to see that I had to go to Andover and not Basingstoke Hospital :yikes: I could almost walk to Basingstoke Hospital from where I live! Anyway, not being one to argue (much) I made the appointment for this morning. Its only about 30 minutes away (unless of course you get lost, which we did, but no matter, we were almost an hour early). Its a really small Hospital, no reception, nowhere to check in, no shops, nowhere to buy a newspaper to wile away the hour :roll: I went in on time and when I asked the radiographer why Andover, she said that Basingstoke didn't have a scanner - I was amazed. Apparently they used to send people to the Hampshire Clinic (Private and also within walking distance!) but it proved to be very expensive hence the installation of a scanner in Andover. Anyway, I digress (as usual). It would seem that I am almost the same height as I was at 14 years old (wish I was the same weight :donut: ) which quite surprised me. I was always considered tall in my teens (5ft 7inches in old money) but everyone seems to tower over me now even though I'm still 5'7\"" so this generation must just be taller. I get the results in 3 to 4 weeks, but as I didn't have a DEXA at the beginning of my diagnosis I won't have anything to compare it with. Sorry to bore you all, just had a spare 5 minutes with nothing to do :zzz:

"Hello Everyone out there with the dreaded PMR. I have been back to see my GP today after taking 4mgs of pred for 3 months and now having to increase again. Can't seem to get under this 5mg dose! Just wondered if anyone has been given Methotrexate and Biphosponates?
GP has mentioned these today but I am not keen. Have got to have blood tests tomorrow.
Can anyone shed any light please. I am feeling fed up with myself and now have got a tooth playing up so dentist tomorrow too!

"Had a rheumy appointment this morning, and saw the top man himself who still doesn't accept after 2 years that what I have is PMR. He still insists that I'm too young at 68, and when I said I spoke to people on the internet in their 50's who had it, he said they have probably been misdiagnosed!!! I'm down to 3.5 prednisolone, after being down to 2, and going up to 5mg because of a flare. He's signed me off, saying ""I'm nearly there"" whatever that means, and I'm not sorry, in my opinion it's been a complete waste of time going to see him, I get far more sense from my GP. He doesn't come up with an alternative if it isn't PMR, and just says it could be any number of things including disc trouble!! At each visit I've waited an hour past my appointment time to be seen too, so am quite pleased that I shall not be going again!!

"I have had pmr for nearly three years now, after two years my consultant was keen for me to reduce the steroids altogether. She quoted inflammatory markers - crp 10 and esr 26 just over the upper limit. I was on 6 mg in August when these tests were done in the afternoon. I am always much better in the afternoons would this give a lower test result? I have reduced the steroids now to 3 mg but this is having a huge impact on life. I feel I still have pmr the symptoms on this low dose are almost the same as when I was first diagnosed. My consultant thinks the pains are coming from osteoarthritis as the inflammatory markers are low hence the advice to come off the steroids - could she be basing her advice on artificially low scores because it was the afternoon and the steroids I was taking at the time.

"Hello, I'm a 61 year old man diagnosed with PMR and have had the condition for 2 months. At first I was convinced that the pains I suffered were triggered by Mctimony Chiropactic treatment (gentle spine manipulation and muslce massage) I was receiving. A day after my first session I started getting PMR symtoms though I didn't know what PMR was at the time. My doctor recognised the systoms and said the cause is unknown. I've searched online for possible incidences of back treatment followed by the onset of PMR and failed to find anything. I wonder if anyone on this forum has had a similar experience. If not may be you can suggest where else to post this enquiry.

"Hi fellow PMR club members. Not been on here for a long time. Don't like the new format.
I have had PMR/GCA for over 3 years now. some time ago the Rheumy put me on Methotrexate. Within a month I had had a mild heart attack and became very breathless. After many tests on my heart and constant badgering from me it was decided that I should stop the methotrexate. This really improved the breathlessness, unfortunatly I have lost 25% of my lung capacity, shortly after I suffered an attack of pancreatitis. ( the pain of this was unbelievable ) This was attributed to methotrexate and pred. I am presently on 6mg of pred, the rheumy wants me to reduce to 5mg over 6months and then start on Azathioprine. After the experiences with Methotrexate I am nervous about starting on a DMARD. Have any of you good folks any knowledge of this treatment?
I wish you all a pain free future

"Hello everyone. I haven't posted on this site for ages, mainly because I got confused with using the site. But thought I'd really make the effort and I seem to be there!
I wonder how others get on with reducing the steroids. I am down to 5 mg per day, after starting on 15 mg last October. As I reduce, the symptoms seem to be gradually returning. However, some days are better than others, and evenings are always better than mornings - which I know most of you will recognise. I reduced from 7 to 6 after one month and 6 to 5 after two months. After about a week on 5 mg per day, I found symptoms quite bad, but they seem to be a little better now (after nearly two weeks), and I think this has happened every time I've reduced - except that it's a little worse every time I reduce. I've been advised to stay on 5 mg for two months before trying to reduce again. I just wondered whether others' experiences are similar.
Best wishes to everyone

"Hi, I'm fairly new to this site and found it invaluable. Was diagnosed with pmr in march 2012 thinking I had flu. Was in bed for a week couldn't move much, achy shoulders, painfully arms, hips and back. I have never had pain like it. Was put on 30mg of prednisolone but then presented with diabetes type 2 . Also I have lost 6stone in the last year, although I was overweight it's not how you want to loose it. Now I have to have a liver biopsy for two small nodes that have grown and they don't know why. Checked for cancer and all clear thank goodness!

"I was told I had Polymyajia in February of this year. Doctor started me off on 30mgs a day. I suffered quite horribel side effects. Heart pulpations , seemed to be away with the fairies if you know what I mean. My memory also suffered. Could'nt remember not paying for some goods in a shop, but thought when I got home that I had'nt paid and went back. Seemed detatched from things. I am now down to 15mgs a day, still wake up in the morning with very achy muscle pain in thw top of my arms and shoulders.
The thing I want to ask is, does the polymyajia cause my fatigue, also I am very low within myselfand must admit do have a cry now and then, can't seem to stop it. Or is this down to the side effects of the steriods. I do have alot on my plate, a husband who is quite a few years older than myself and has various health problems that have been on going for a number of years.Before this started with myself, I was always a get up and go person, had to be, this at the moment has semmed to knocked the stuffing out of me. So sorry to go on, would be grateful if anyone could tell me , is it the steriods, or is this something I have to live with while I have got this.

"I am interested to know if any of my fellow PMR/GCA sufferers out there have experienced worsening symptoms when reducing steroid dosage which they have put up with for a couple of weeks rather than increasing again immediately? If so, has anyone found that the discomfort has eventually eased on the decreased dose and how long has that taken, please? Just wondering, as 7 days ago I decreased from 4mgs to 3mgs and the legs have worsened along with a little discomfort in the shoulder area on one side - this is the stage I was at 12 months ago and then continued going up and down between 10mgs and 5mgs for the year, so if I have to increase yet again, I feel I have not improved in the whole 12 months! Have now been on steroids for 2 years. Very depressing and disappointing until I get my head around it again and just accept it! Best wishes to all of you like people out there! The mornings are the worst (can't get my socks on - not good with this Jack Frost around!!)

"Hi all
I havent been on here for a while - the new format has put me off.
You might recall I recently had to increase my pred from nearly nothing to 5mg. I know now that I decreased too fast after that. Have been on 2.5mg for a few weeks and my ESR has gone up again to 24 (that was last week and I think it might be even higher now).I have an increasing neck stiffness. I think I had better put myself up to 5mg again and this time be sensible and do the really slow decrease I did before.
Are you off them now Mrs O? Sorry - I haven't been looking on here for a while so might have missed your posts.

"Hi everybody, I was wondering if anybody could give me some advice please?
I went to my dentist in December 2011 as my ""clicking jaw"" had locked, and was creating significant pain and no movement. Previously I had been supplied with a guard to wear during the night to stop my grinding of teeth (I didn't know I did this) but my dentist believed this is what was causing the clicking, grating and inability to open my mouth more than about one inch.
After the second lot of muscle relaxants he referred me to oral surgery at my local hospital. To cut a long story short - I have had xrays and an MRI scan both have shown significant degeneration on the left hand side of my jaw bone. After the XRay I was diagnosed with having severe osteo arthritis in my jaw.
However, when going back for the results of the MRI scan, I have a new consultant who thinks that I could have PMR as I also get weakness/pain in my joints/arms/neck - which previously had been put down to the fact that I have a prolapsed disc in my neck.
I have also suffered with severe ""tingling"" in my legs which does border on being painful, but my GP has never been terribly worried about this.
I am not sure as to the consultants diagnosis, as I don't appear to be in as much pain (I realise how lucky I am) as some people are reporting, but could this be due to the fact that I take tramadol and anti inflammatory already because of my jaw and neck?
I am 41.
Thank you.

"My PMR was diagnosed in November and I was started on 50mg prednisolone. Pain was in shoulders, arms and thighs.
At 16mg now ,with pain still in arms (trouble doing hair, lifting things amd managing certain movements) and shoulders. Indicators in latest blood tests normal even though I was in pain on the day test was taken.
My GP said that 12-15mg prednisolone would be fine for the surgery but after phoning my surgeon's rooms was told he would like me off the steroids completely.
I do not want to postpone my operation for a number of very good reasons but of course am worried about reducing from 16mg to nil in 3 weeks.
I would be so grateful if any of you kind people who have had major surgery while on prednisolone would let me know of your experiences. This is my first forum posting but I have found this site so informative.
If I can put up with the pain will it do me any long lasting harm? My GP said I will probably have to up my dose after the surgery.
I am just so worried and as well as hardly being able to walk because of the pain in my knee, trying to cope with the PMR and the awful side affects of the prednisolone, of which I have so many, I am feeling pretty desperate.
Thank you and I look forward so much to your replies..

"My wife (72) has been suffering increasing pain over the last several months. The pains are mainly in her upper arms/shoulders and her legs. The pains and associated weakness are worst in the morning or after rest. She has no power in her limbs but the symptoms ease once she is active. She has had blood tests which indicate a (slightly) high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and there is also a marker on her C-protein level. I'm no doctor but it seems that all the indicators point to polymyalgia. In all other respects she is perfectly fit. The GP seems to agree but has made a referral to a Consultant before taking any further action. In the meantime, to aid sleep, which, at the moment, is minimal, the Amitriptyline prescription has been bumped up to 50mg. Does anyone know why a GP seems so unwilling to commit to a diagnosis? I understand that the standard treatment for polymyalgia is steroids and that the results of such a prescription are virtually immediate and dramatic. Is this treatment so dangerous that it can only be undertaken as a last resort?

"My wife, Tamar, is the patient. She has always been prescribed prednisolone enteric coated. (For the past 15 months.) The prescription has just been changed to uncoated. I understand this is a cost cutting directive from the PCT - ""Prednisolone enteric coated tablets currently cost £8.69 for 28 tablets of the 5mg strength. However, the uncoated versions currently cost £1.03 for 28 tablets of the 5mg strength."" Some articles online suggest that the case for enteric coated has not been made categorically. However, Tamar has a history of ulceration, and after 3 days on the uncoated, she has had stomace ache, nausea, and also her blood glucose has gone higher than usual. I managed to persuade the duty doctor to change the prescription for now but will have to take up the issue of a repeat prescription with her GP. Any relevant experience or opinion on this here?

"and I am feeling better in some ways and worse in others. The cancer numbers have gone way down and I am in partial remission once again so it is good.
My CRP is way up higher then it was when my GP put me on prednisone.
The ESR rate is very high too.
I feel swollen and sore all the time. My shoulders and hips and thighs are very sore now and were not on the prednisone.
My TSH is very low and so is my Free T4 which means it is not a thyroid issue but a hypothymus gland or petuitory gland issue. Which means possible tumor.
Okay my GP has all these results but she has bothered to contact me at all. I am going to make an appointment and ask her how I can control the inflammation. If it were caused by Osteoarthritis alone then someone should be telling me this.
It is not the luekemia causing the inflammation because the numbers are lower now then ever. It is only slightly noticeable on the tests. Which means the prednisone did it some good.
Do any of you think I should go to the doctor asking for more help? I am feeling kind of helpless.

"Hi - haven't used this site for some time. Have been battling to come off steroids since diagnosis in 2007 - finally down to 2 mgs - made much better by retirement last year - a chance to listen and respond to my body needs!!
Agree with all the comments about the changes to this site - I certainly could not have gained the support and comfort it used to give me in the early days when all I could manage to do was sit in front of the computer and press a few buttons - just knowing what I was going through was normal to other sufferers, kept me sane. I find it so difficult now to follow what the disucssion is and whether it meets my neeeds - I certainly couldn't have followed it in the early pain brain scrambled days.
Enough of complaints as I realise they are trying to sort things out for us, and it is not the fault of the computer experts that we are not computer wizz kids ourselves!!
My question is, despite being on such a low dose of steroids when presumably I am also producing my own cortisone as well by now - Why do I pick up every common cold and cough that is going? Has anyone any ideas for prevention - someone once told me I should increase my steroids when i get a cold but i don't particularly want to do this as am desparate to try and finally get off them and it has taken me till now to get this low.
Has any one tried echinacea and does that combine well with steroids - one claims to boost the immune system but i thought steroids surpress the immune system - can anyone expain it to me?

"I seen my oncologist today and she got a letter from my rhuemotologist saying that what I have is not PMR as the symptoms and tests results were not typical. When he wrote her it was before he got the x-rays and the bone scan test results back. The bone scan shows arthritis in the wrists and ankles as well as the sternum. I have no idea what the x-rays show. I have Tietze syndrome which means I could have a variety of different types of arthritis. The prednisone has caused all the problems with the CLL/SLL and I need to get off of it ASAP. So it is 1/2 pill a week withdrawel from this point on. I am hoping my arthritis specialist has an answer for me on the 27th of this month so I know what it is. I swear I am in so much pain still and if it were PMR, I should not be. So the GP jumped the gun and stuck me on this horrible drug which has in turn caused numerous other problems. I pretty much have every single side effect it gives. Anyway that is where I stand at this point. Once I find out what kind of arthritis this is I am going to post to that one. I have to go in for blood sugar testing tomorrow as the oncologist suspects I have diabetes from the prednisone. What I still am not understanding is why in the first month of taking prednisone I had most of the pain gone but then it all started to creep back during the second month. I've been on the drug for a bit over three months now and it progressively is getting worse in the pain department. My ribs are killing me. Thank you all for your support through this.

"Hi all
I have just found this new format. I do wish things would sometimes stay the same. Are you all still out there? I feel abandoned as I rely on you all so much. Where are the emoticons etc??? HELP.
I am back on 2.5mg every day now and ESR back to normal. Planning to stay on that for a month then start the slow reductions again.
Did you see my post on old forum Eileen? About my ESR going way down low before suddenly going high?? Any explanations anyone??

"To-day I read in a Swedish paper that Dr Sarah Maddocks, Cardiff has published an article about Manuka honey that shows that this honey can heal wounds that are otherwise hard to heal. As I have read several posts some months ago on this forum about the positive effects of Manuka honey also for persons with pmr, I wanted to share this article. I googled Manuka honey Sarah Maddocks and got a number of sites to read.

Trying to get used to the new format.
I am now on 7 mg, Preds,& feeling better, still have good days & bad ones, aches in legs & lower back, but am able to walk a bit more.
I am sure I read that at 7mg your immune system starts to return , am I right in thinking that?
Hoping the weight will start to go too.

My hubby noticed earlier that I have several white spots on both my outer ears....they are not sore and I was blissfully un-aware of them until he saw them :roll:
I went to the chemists armed with my spanish translation of my history and current meds,thinking I could just get some drops, but when they saw all the stuff I was on they said I really need to see a doctor instead, so am going to the local clinic in the morning.
The spots are white with no redness around them, and no-where else is affected so I don't think it is a reaction to soap or shampoo. I am otherwise well enough and finding the lovely heat very soothing.
Just when you think everything is going along nicely, something else always manages to drag you back to reality :cry: , and as the chemist quite rightly pointed out, I am on 3 medications that affect immunity, so I can't really blame them for being a bit cautious.
Will let you all know how I get on with my new Medico Espagnole :wink:

"I've not posted for awhile because things have been very difficult for me and I am still having pain.
I have heard from others on other boards that it is possible to have PMR and Rhuematoid Arthritis at the same time. What are anyones thoughts about this on this board.
Also my prednisone has been changed to drop only 2.5 mg a month until I get back to 20 mg daily. I am presently at 9.5 pills a day which is 47.5 mg a day for another three weeks then I go down to 45 and so on and on. I have what appears to be weight gain on my face and back of my neck but I actually weigh less. It is frustrating. I also am worried about other side effects due to the high dosage.
The reason the doctors do not want to bring it down faster is because it is also treating my CLL. My splean and many of my glands are very swollen due to the CLL. I look like the stay puff marshmellow man.
I have four more days of work then I am not working anymore as I am feeling so weak, tiered very sore. I am applying for disability. I hope I get it because my family cannot survive on my husbands income alone.
Isn't it dangerous to be on such a high dose?
Also can it make the hips weak? My hips are so sore and walking is difficult again like it was before I went on the prednisone.
Thank you for any advice, help etc.

I've had Polymyalgia for a year and a half. I started on 20mg of Pred and have reduced to 2mg. The only time I experience shoulder pain now is when I taper down too quickly. I tried 1mg but the pain came back. I tried to 'put up with it for 3 weeks but ended up back on 2mg which seems to work.
But for the last two evenings I've had throbbing, aching jaw pain on one side. I also have a slight headache during the pain. It doesn't hurt more when I chew. My eye sight hasn't changed, but I have had a blurry eye for months which specialists can't find the reason for. My scalp isn't tender.
Taking pain killers didn't even touch the pain of my jaw. I feel the pain in my gums but it's not dental because after throbbing in my bottom gum it changed to the top gum.
The symptoms don't seem to fit GCA?

"Hi all.
For the first time in 3 months I was awoken last night by pain in my hands and they were still swollen and sore this morning until about 1 1/2 hours after i took my meds :cry:. Right knee and both shoulders also a bit sore again but tolerable.
How am I supposed to gauge whether this is
(A) because I have reduced the pred by 1mg to 9mgs a day since 8 days ago.....or
(B) Because it is cold and wet here and I always feel worse in those conditions.
I honestly do not know which scenario is causing the increased pain and as my rheumy is very keen to get me down to single figures of pred I am loath to try upping it again :roll:.
I find that I am far more mobile and pain free when I am in the Spanish heat so maybe I should just stick things out until I get back there after Christmas......what do you all think???

I was wondering if I could ask for advice please?
I've tapered down from 20mg to 1.5mg. It's taken me a year. But I seem to be having great difficulty getting down to 1mg. I've been trying for about 6 weeks but every time I get down to 1mg I start to feel very stiff and sore and very tired.
Also, has anyone else had the following problems?
For 6 months my right eye has been very blurry. I've been to an Eye Specialist and even though she said I have a very small cataract she doesn't seem to think that's what's causing my blurry vision. She even tested me for a brain tumour but she has no idea what's causing the blurred vision. My vision stays blurry 24/7 and hasn't gotten worse or better over that time. She knows I have Polymyalgia.
Can steroids cause blurry vision?
Also I seem to have constant cold sores. Would that be due to a compromised immune system due to the cortisone ?

"Hi all,
I had a review with my rheumy yesterday and he decided it was time to attempt to get into single figures with my deltacortril as I have been on 10mgs since July :oops:
I am staying on the same 20mg dose of MTX and the Embrel injections for the RA, so hopefully things will go smoothly, although the consultant I saw felt that I still had PMR symptoms in my shoulders as there is not full range of movement.
I think I have just become used to the way things are now,and because my hands were giving me more bother I hadn't really paid much notice to the shoulders :roll: . I told the consultant that everything starts to become relative....yes I still get pain, but relative to what it was a few months ago it is not too bad. Likewise, my injections don't hurt me at all now as I have become used to them.
The cold weather is not helping matters though....it was bitterly cold here yesterday and today is wet and windy, so I can't wait to get back to Spain......just the little matter of Christmas to get sorted out first :lol:
Hope everyone is staying nice and warm and pain free.

"Considering where I live, capital of Canada for seniors. I am very lucky that I do not have to wait more then a month and half to see a specialist. My appointment is mid January. I am still having pain over my eye and a very heavy feeling inside my skull there. I am having swelling issues in my feet and hands from the prednisone and my muscles are feeling weaker by the day. I do believe I will have to quit my job after Christmas. I really do not see this going anywhere good with the heavy lifting. There is no way to not lift less then 10 pounds in the jobs I do so hopefully EI Canada will still give me benefits once I quit do to illness. I've read on their site that I am entitled to benefits regardless as it is not my fault I got ill. Otherwise I am sleeping way better because the pain is 90% gone. I only have a small amount of joint pain and this headache. I've had the headache so long that it seems to be my friend now. :roll: It is not as harsh as it was without the prednisone but none the less still there.

"Hi
I'm new here, so quick background info. I have had ulcerative colitis for 35 yrs and was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica after a haywire blood test last Feb, which had been masked for the previous 6 months by a degenerative spinal condition.
My super GP put me on high dose prednisolone tabs, all enteric coated, and I am now reducing. Thanks to the tablets, the PMR is recovering well and my UC has been brilliantly calm all year. Was down to 10 mg when I had a nasty UC flare up.
The UC was starting to calm down again - as it does - when my GP decided I could reduce the dosage to 9 mg (1 x 5 EC tab and 4 x non-EC tabs per day). Instant relapse of UC!!
As all of us know, steroids don't leave the body for a long time, and neither do their side effects (I wish!).
But it does mean a daily dose of 9 mg can be averaged out over, say, 3 days and taken as 2 x 5 mg EC tabs one day, 2 x 5 mg EC tabs the next, and 1 x 5 mg EC tab + 1 x 2.5 mg EC tab the next = 10 + 10 + 7.5 = 27.5 mgs over the 3 days (or just over 9.1 mg each day). Then repeat the 3-day cycle (I mark off the correct dosage for the day on the calendar.)
Similarly, as my old maths teacher used to say, to make up a daily dose of 8 mg for example, you could take 2 x 5 mg EC tabs the first day, then 1 x 5 mg EC plus 1 x 2.5mg EC tab for each of the following 2 days = 10 + 7.5 + 7.5 = 25 mg over the 3 days (or just over 8.1 mg per day).
With the approval of your GP and a bit of ingenuity you need never take a non-enteric coated tablet again! Even below 2 mg it should be possible to take 1 x 2.5 mg EC tab every other day.
Of course, IT IS IMPORTANT YOU KEEP TRACK OF YOUR DOSAGE EVERY SINGLE DAY.
My GP tells me he is under pressure from our PCT not to prescribe 5 mg EC tablets if the patient can tolerate the non-EC version, so you may have to get him/her to push for you. But, hey, you could always double up on the 2.5 mg EC tabs which apparently are freely prescribable. (And no, we don't understand it either.)
Hope this tip helps someone else. Best of luck out there

I am on 50 mg of prednisone and it seems to help a lot but I still have alot of pain while at work. I have a job where I stand for 7.5 hours and lift up to 60 pounds. I know this is bad for me and have done all I can short of quitting to make it easier on myself. I am going to ask my doctor to write a note for me so I can be excused from lifting. If that is not good enough then I will be having to leave somehow. Financially it will be impossible to just leave a job. I also have CLL which is monitored. I was diagnosed with that in 1995. Anyone have any insights on what I can expect from this disease. I may also have RA. The pain is unreal at times.

"Hello all
Saw my Doc last week and she prescribed my 15mg daily dose of Pred. to continue for another month (that will be almost 2 months since I started). That's because I still have occasional slight pain in the mornings. This still seems to be improving. But I do still have almost constant lower back pain. It's not usually too bad, just niggling. I've had it since my other PMR symptoms began, but never particularly associated this with PMR, but I wondered if others have it as part of their symptoms. I should have mentioned it to the Doc, but I only had about 5 minutes with her. She's very nice, but I did feel hurried and I forgot to mention the back pain - as we were discussing other things, like any side-effects of steroids, and the bone density scan I was due for the next day.

"Hi everyone
I just wondered if people usually have a drug to protect bones (sorry, I don't know what the drug is called) while they are on steroids for PMR. My aunt had to take steroids for quite a long time due to asthma and now has osteoporosis badly (she's 85). She is taking the drug now, which may have arrested it, but my view is 'prevention is better than cure'. A Doctor friend of mine is keen that I should have this. I shall be having a bone density scan but, presumably, that only shows deterioration if it has already taken place. I understand that there can be problems with this drug, but I thought it would be worth taking it while I'm on the Pred. I'll be seeing my own GP next week and shall mention it.
Any advice?

"Hello everyone
It was so helpful to me to find this site, and hear about other people's experiences with PMR. I was diagnosed about a month ago, and have been on Prednisone (15mg) for about a week and a half. The pain and stiffness is much better. In the afternoons I would hardly know I had a problem. Somehow, I think I was led to understand that I could be completely pain free on the steroids and I've been feeling a little disappointed that this hasn't happened. But I understand from this site that I shouldn't expect too much - and that helps actually.
I wasn't over the moon about taking steroids, especially as it can cause depression. I have been feeling a little 'down' but that is well compensated by the lack of pain and being able to live a fairly normal life again.
Good luck to everyone and thanks for the helpful postings.

My question is this - what would cause absolutely all joint stiffness to suddenly disappear??

Hello dianetheartist
I'm sorry to hear of your PMR diagnosis and worse still that earlier treatment by Naprosyn has led to Tinnitus - I do hope this will eventually resolve especially if, as I know from my friend's experience, it keeps you awake at night.
As to whether the moon face side effect of steroids is \""inevitable\"", most people do seem unable to avoid this although it can vary from person to person. However, the good news is that it disappears as you reduce the dose. A low carb diet can help to keep the steroid induced weight gain to a minimum.
Yes, PMR can and does burn itself out but the real question without a definite answer is WHEN?! For some it can go into remission in 18 months to 2 years and for others it takes longer. I have been on steroids for 4 1/2 years, commencing on high dose 40mgs due to GCA as well as PMR and am now down to half a mg a day.
Others will be along with lots more info for you but meanwhile do hope you continue with a smooth journey to recovery from both PMR and tinnitus.

Had an appointment at the hospital on friday, with regard to the clots I had earlier in the year.
Anyway I had to wear a heart monitor for 24 hrs & the lady doc told me they picked up a couple of blips, need to talk to her again as I cant remember what it was,apart from a leaky valve & some fluid around the heart, was told it was nothing to worry about , as if I couldnt worry!
Anyway she told me to up my bisoprolol from 1.25mg to 2.5 mg , which I did on the sat morn, ,my, did I feel queer after that, so drowsy, couldnt keep my eyes open, couldnt function , just sat in the chair all day till 5 p.m. when I started to feel more myself.
side effects say can cause extreme drowsiness.
So today I didnt take the extra tablet, but still feel out of it a bit.
Will ring the hospital tomorrow to see if I can talk to the doc & tell her what has happened, I am too scared to take them again apart from the 1.25mg which I havent had any problems with to date.
Sorry to drop all this on you lovely people, but to just know I can is wonderful, thank you so much for your time.
I am dropping down quite well on the steroids , just didnt expect this .

I ended up in A & E last night with breathing problems. They said I appeared to have a bad chest infection. They have taken some of gunk to analyse (at last) and in meantime have given me 7 days of Amoxycillin 500mg X 3 times a day. They said I might need longer.
They said I should also really be taking 30mg Pred for 5 days and then revert to my normal dose (2.5, 0 alt days). I practically screamed in frustration and the doc eventually agreed that I should wait until the results of the culture are back. i will see my lady doc next Tuesday.
Well, Eileen, should I take that dose of Pred?? Will I be able to reduce immediately back to my usual dose after 5 days?? or is it different for us PMR lot??
My 88 yr old father who also has PMR, was erecently in hosp with nasty case of pneumonia and they did not increase his Pred.
If the culture comes back without bugs I shall be really worried. Am seeing ENT consultant privately next Wed, but wonder now if thats apppropriate.
We are off to france on 2nd Aug, and am worried about travelling with these breathing probs..
Another thing, years ago I was tested for Alpha 1 antytrypsin gene (to do with chest problems my husband was having at the time - he came up with 1 good and 1 bad (PiMS) and so did I. That gives me, I believe 80% of the stuff and my blood contained 1.2 (1.1 to 2.1 being normal range). I am worried incase acid reflux from stomach has been aspirated into lungs and that has triggered COPD as a result of that genetic fault. (smoking can apparently trigger it). What do you think? Do you know anything about that??
Thanks Eileen

What can I say......Gemlarex have worked for me. I am now on 10mg pred daily and the one Gemlarex. The symptoms are definately still there, but bearable. My Rheumy does not think they have anything to do with it, but I know they are having a positive effect whilst weaning off of the preds. May not work for everyone, but definately works for me.

Anyway, I have managed alongside my doctor's advice, to get down to just 3mgs of pred a day now, and I generally feel very fit and well after starting out with 20mgs of Pred and being racked with pain all over my body last year.
The thing is, since I have dropped to 3mg I am again feeling some stiffness in my upper arms, shoulders and neck on waking in the morning. This usally gets much better as the day goes on and I move around, but doesn't actually go away completely. I have always believed that when you decrease your dose successfully there should be no pain at all befre you drop down further.
I have been decreasing the doses by 1mg every 2 weeks and have been fine, but I am now wondering if I should drop any further while I have this morning stiffness? And do I need to up my dose again to get rid of it?
I am a little dissapointed as I have been doing so well with my Pred reductions in general. :cry:
Advice would be appreciated.

"When you mention flares do you mean that you have been pain free, and now your're not , or do you mean that you have reverted back to how you felt at the very begining, with severe pain in many muscles. I have not been completley pain free since diagnosis in January this year, but it is a bearable discomfort, and have managed to reduce from 15mg to 8. My Esr and Crp had reduced to normal levels within 6 weeks, so cant use those as indicators.

"Well, for all the panic going on in my life - mostly down to Grandson Jake and his eventful life :roll: - I'm still managing to reduce, albeit very slowly. I'd whistled down to 2.5mgs with few problems :run: before his big op, went back up to 5mgs and stayed there for 3 months on the advice of many people on this site who'd had a flare-up. Now I've just taken about 9 weeks to get down to 4.5mgs. My aches and pains today are due to sitting by a Hospital bed for a few days so I know they'll go away after a couple of easy days. I'm thinking maybe I should stay on 4.5mgs for a few weeks - any thoughts on this? I'm in no rush, although it would be good to get back down to 2.5mgs as I know I was OK on that dose before, feeling really quite well most of the time :magic: . Shattered today (for those not on the other site, Jake was rushed back into Hospital in the week so I have been sitting in a hard chair for a while). Nice settee with my feet up and the DVD of the Kings' Speech coming up in a few minutes :tea: :cupcake: !
Take care everyone, have a good weekend,

"Hi All,
Talk about treacle brain!!
I have just realised that I have been dropping preds every month ,by 2 mg instead of one, I was going to do it by 2 halfs each month halfway through the month & at the end.& I have just realised I was doing 1mg every half month & again at the end, how daft is that!!!
No wonder this time I have had 4/5 days feeling rough again , till today when my head has cleared, still very tired & achy,& tearful, but hopefully as the day progresses I shall feel better.
I should laugh really, but maybe I will later in the day.
I have always been on top of things in the past, so this has really knocked me sideways.
I research family history for my friends & need my head to be clear & screwed on properly.

"Hello All
This is my second post, and I hate talking about myself, but thought I would come to you all for advice. I would much prefer to just reply to other peoples posts in a supportive way and hope therefore that this will be my last post about me!!
My first post gave background on me..summarised as having been diagnosed recently with confirmed PMR, although had the problem since Dec 2010. Have been on 40mg pred daily for some time. Had stopped or reduced steroids, on or off over time, in the forlorn hope that the PMR had gone away. Silly me, everytime I took that route the PMR came back with a vengeance.
My Rheumy has put me on a reduction plan to go from 40mg a day to 30mg a day. To then stay at 30mg until I see him in 3weeks time when he hoped to put me on to 20mg a day, where he thought that that level would be my maintenance dose. He said that he thought I would be on that level for quite some time, maybe a year or so, and then he hoped that the PMR would begin to burn itself out over time and I would be on a lower pred dose for a couple of years until the PMR went totally.(hopefully!)
Having read the many posts on this forum I quickly realised just how important it is to be on the lowest dose of pred possible. So rather foolishly maybe, or very stupidly, or downright dangerously, I gave the matter some thought about 5 or 6 days ago.
The rheumy had me on what I will call a 'top down' strategy of lowering the dose from a high 40mg to find a level that would be my maint dose. Which may well have turned out at 20mg daily. I thought that I would try the reverse of that.... I would adopt a 'bottom up' strategy and start on a low dose and flex that up over time to find a level that I could cope with body wise and hopefully would not give too many adverse side effects.
So as of 5ish days ago I started to take 5mg daily and not the 30mg I was on (prev 40mg). I felt awful with terrible virus type feelings, and of course the PMR saw its chance and came back strongly over the intervening days. Whereas though the full PMR originally was in my neck, shoulders, back, hips, thighs, and arms .... over the last couple of days or so it is mainly evident in my forearms, biceps, shoulders, and rear thighs. My forearms have been excrutiatingly painful, and I can hardly hold any weight in the arms as a consequence, even to hold a phone up is too much. And as for my rear thighs, getting out of a chair is becoming very very difficult. So it is clear to me that 5mg is no good as a maint dose for me, so I have upped that to 7.5 mg from today. My plan is to keep it at that level for 3 or 4 days and if the forearms and thighs do not improve I will keep upping by 2.5mg a day (have 5mg tabs which I cut in half) until i find the dose that works. Hopefully less than the top down route which may well have left me on 20mg for a considerable time.
I note from the many posts that it is important to get to as low a dose as poss, and this 'bottom up' approach will allow me to find that level. Obviously as I am in the fairly early days of this dreaded PMR I have to honour my body and find a dose that works. I could easily go back to 40mg which was a miracle cure for me...but I have to balance that with the side effect points and therefore find a dose that may not take away all pain etc but will at least allow me to move ok.
I tried the 5mg as a start point for my plan, based on the points made about the body producing its own 7.5mg level of cortisone.
I feel better virus wise now, so I think that I am over the worst and its now a case of finding my maint dose in a way that delivers the body benefits that I desperately need, without triggering too many side effects of the steroids.
A few questions please:
1 - When I took the 5mg of pred would my body still produce the 7.5mg naturally, meaning that I would have had in me 12.5mg... or would the body only produce the shortfall of 2.5mg. I accept my body may be producing nothing at the moment due to adrenal gland shut down. But as I used to start and stop steroids I hope mine is still working albeit intermittently!
2 - What is the sensible 'tipping point' for raising the steroid dose. Obviously as I was on the 5mg I had no choice but to raise as my forearms were terrible and my rear thighs likewise. But should i keep upping the dose until they clear fully or until they are bearable. Do I cause them long term damage if I end up on 10mg of pred and those muscles are ok but still hurt a lot but i can cope with it...or should I raise the dose until they are very alright!! I dont know if I will damage them long term if I stick on too low a dose for a year or so and the pain and stiffness is too great... versus having a higher dose with the pain much reduced, but risking greater pred side effects
3 - Is 3 or 4 days in between my 'bottom up' raising the dose ok. I knew the 5mg dose was woefully inadequate very quickly as the full force of the PMR returned. I know there can be overlap between steroid withdrawal symptoms and those of PMR..but I know the 5mg is not strong enough. I may well end up in similar position to what the rheumy feels with a 20mg maint dose, but I hope the 'bottom up' route will allow for the lowest possible dose that works to be found. I have mentally set a goal of 10mg as the maint dose which is half of that the the cons feels I may need. I know I will have some pain and stiffness at whatever level I end up on, and it is finding that balance of acceptable pain v side effects.
4 - Am I risking CGA developing by doing this 'bottom up' route and thereby allowing the PMR to gain a stronger foothold, and risk CGA starting also, due to the drive for the lowest dose of pred possible.
5 - I am going to re-start gentle walking etc (felt too bad since I dropped to 5mg, and besides was oh so depressed mentally )... and does jacuzzi type heat help at all. I cant swim sadly but if heated water would help I could do that also.
6- Is dosage affected by size etc. eg I am a 55 year old male, 6 foot 4 inches tall, weigh 15 stone (was 14 stone pre pred ), although I am still in quite good shape visually at least.... well from a distance anyway!! Would a 5mg dose for a lady for example be the same as a 10mg dose for me.
Thank you to all who read this... and I know that by doing a full u-turn from top down dosage to bottom up dosage is not a clever thing to do, aspecially in a space of a day or so. I will never repeat that and will treat the steroids with respect from now on.... though I am still amazed at the obvious problems that people experience from dropping from 5mg over many many months. I will of course honour your experiences and will tread very carefully whenever I can reach that level. I will stick to rheumy advice, and indeed all of your wonderful advice to the letter from now on.
I now ACCEPT that I have PMR, accept that the preds only treat the symptoms, accept that the PMR is not cured by preds, accept that I could have this for many years, accept that I cant self dose the steroids with what I think, accept that I must listen to the rheumy and follow his recommends, and most importantly of all, understand that there are many people out there, especially on this forum that know a million times better than me based on their own experiences, and therefore listen intently to their advice. All of these things I pledge, to my poor little body, to do.
Kind Regards (PS I am still sitting on the naughty step for self dosing!!)

"I come to this site every day and have been wondering why there were no new posts. Working on the automatic, I just glanced at the top entry which, being a sticky, stayed put at 8th Aug. That will teach me to engage the main brain in future.
It looks as though Pauline and Eileen have been having a particularly rough time. Fingers crossed the new drug you choose will do the trick, Pauline. I am still bruising very easoly and am only on 5. I do find it strange that, although my skin is like tissue paper and I only have to brush against a surface to bring up purple patches, small injuries heal amazingly quickly. What are the steroids doing? Not sure I want to know as there is no alternative as my least favourite lady said.
Eileen, you say 15. Does that mean every day or are you still using your ADT regime? The latter, I hope.
I couldn't stand the temperatures your friend and your husband have had. I find it much easier to get warm in cold weather than cool in hot. Today is lovely. Bare arms and able to move without sweating. Three more months, please and an inch of rain a week at night. ( Monty Don's idea )
I remember you saying that it was amazing the difference that even 0.5 a day could make. I'd been on 4 for two months and not doing too well in the pain dept. but fine in myself. Doctor said go back to 5 for three months and six days later pain has halved. Neck pain still a worry but no sign of jaw or eye probs. Reported this and GP reckons it's \""just\"" PMR. I'm thinking of ringing him and asking if, should I get GCA symptoms at weekend ( when else do problems ever crop up? ), should I up my dose and to what level.
Rosemary, glad 5 is working for you, too. How long will you stay there? Have just looked up my first time records and see that I had a glitch at 4 then, too. Back to 5 for two and a half months and then 4.5 for a month, then 4 for a month then 0.5 reduction a month until next glitch at 1.75 but after that minute reductions for the next 6 months and that was that. Can I hope history is repeating itself?
Hope the celebrations were good, Lizzie and that you soon match your bloods!
Hells teeth. Now I see I've clicked new topic instead of reply. Is there any hope?
. Will remember to look down the list in future. Think I've caught up now. Sorry to be so long winded.

"Hi all,
I had my appointment this afternoon with my local teaching hospital rheumatology dept....and guess who I saw :?: .
Only the rheumy I have being paying to see for the past 15 months :roll: :lol:. He was doing locum for the usual consultant :!:
Anyway, he was fine with me transferring, and actually suggested it himself as it gives me access to a specialist rheumatology nurse, blood tests & x-rays etc.
The upshot of my visit was that he decided that we had given the MTX a fair shot and it was not making any significant improvement to my symptoms, so the next step is an \""anti-TNF\"" treatment.
I have to be tested for TB and have chest x-rays etc before it can be prescribed so had all that done today, and spent 40 minutes with clinical nurse specialist discussing which drug would suit best. They are all either weekly or alternate week injections, so it is a bit personal choice and a bit which is the most tried and tested. The nurse told me that most people in the clinic use \""Embrel\"" and that it gives huge relief to the majority of them within 2-3 weeks, so have to do a bit of research and wait for test resullts before making a final decision.
I had knocked my left knee off a cupboard yesterday and dropped a carton of milk on my right foot this morning so, coupled with my usual steroid marks I was displaying a fantastic array of bruises today :wink:
The rheumy just looked at my multi-coloured skin and said that the sooner I was off steroids the better :shock: .
I hardly even notice the bruising anymore, unless very obvious.....all I want is some hands and knees that work with a degree of normality 8)
Hope everyone else is keeeping well and you are having better weather than us...it poured rain here this evening.
Love to all,
Pauline.

"This forum has empowered me with the knowledge I was definitely lacking about this PMR condition. Thanks to all the contributors for sharing experiences and little known facts about this disorder. I live in a small town in East Texas and don't know anyone with this disorder or anyone who even knows anyone with it. I love my doctor, but in 35 years he has only treated it twice and that was with an 80 year old and 75 year old. I was assuming that my experience would and should be different than those two people because I am 58, fit, strong and athletic. I had so many questions and the forums I found in the US were not nearly as educational as this one. I found that I am not unique at all. There is someone out there who has had all the experiences and problems I have. My questions were answered before I had to ask them. I read and reread everything that Eileen has ever said. Thank you so much for devoting your time and expertise to this forum. I have learned that is all about the prednisone. I was floundering with that and learned to just take it slow and easy and that it could definitely be withdrawal symptoms from the pred not necessarily not enough pred and to give it a few weeks to see which it was. I am down to 6.5 as of this week and I started this journey at the beginning of January. I prefer to be in control of situations and have found that with PMR it doesn't necessarily follow my plan and that is ok I guess. I will just keep trying and keep reading your experiences to help me know I am doing the right things. Oh, the Nosilla is Allison spelled backwards!

"I have been a reader of discussions here for a couple of months and like so many others, have found them so invaluable for better understanding PMR and how to manage on prednisone. :D
I was diagnosed with (most likely) PMR in April after having a fairly sudden onset of stiffness and pain in legs and shoulders in February. I could actually manage pretty well on ibuprofen as much of the pain would be gone by early afternoon, but by the time I got in to see a rheumatologist in April, his recommendation was to do the routine we all know so well with prednisone, starting at 15 mg and tapering.
I know exactly when I started feeling the 1st symptoms, because I was at a family wedding in the US last October, and my shoulders were feeling strangely achey. By December, I needed help from my partner in pulling sweaters off over my head etc. Then I got a cold or flu that I couldn't seem to shake off for almost all of January (the classic infection that often seems to kickstart these conditions, it seems in retrospect). By the 1st week in February, it was pains in my legs and behind, and stiffness. I kept thinking it was repetitive strain injury from typing and sitting incorrectly perhaps, bought a new computer keyboard and chair and so on. I went to my GP to ask for a referral to a physiotherapist, thinking I might as well do that through my insurance and she took one look at me and said “that's not RSI” and did about 10 blood tests and referred me to a rheumatologist.
I'm sure that all sounds familiar in bits and pieces to just about everyone here! By the time I got in to see a rheumatologist, I had pretty much diagnosed myself as the one thing that exactly fit my symptoms was PMR. However, I was 51 at the time the initial pain and stiffness started, so kind of on the age borderline, so my rheumatologist somewhat questions whether this is the correct diagnosis. I had my 2nd appointment with him a couple of weeks ago, and he thinks it could possibly be something called sternoclavicular hyperstosis, not least because my collarbone popped out of the joint permanently in March when I was doing little more than tying shut a trash bag. Apparently he thinks that the one condition might have started the other -- that my joints might be reacting in a PMR like way. It's hard to find much information on the other condition, but I suppose it's possible. I also wonder whether all of these things are part of a kind of murky spectrum where it is hard to tell what is actually what–and of course you do wonder whether it even matters! In general, the other condition would probably be treated the same way, perhaps just with NSAIDs.
A good family friend who is a retired orthopedic surgeon–and who has also had PMR!– says he actually saw a lot of spontaneous (no particular reason) clavicular (collarbone) dislocations in women And he didn't think it was that unusual (despite what you read on the Internet, where it is claimed that this type of injury only happens in response to severe trauma, like banging yourself off the steering wheel in a car collision, or being tackled by rugby or football players!). And also, the achey pains and stiffness really seem to be more likely to me to be PMR... And of course shoulder and joint problems are a common complication with PMR. On the other hand, most of my discomfort comes from stiffness and pain in the back of my knees, which seems to be a bit unusual (does anyone else have this?).
I just wonder too if anyone else has ever had their rheumatologists suggest this other condition? A point of frustration is that despite having these suspicions, I haven't been sent for an MRI or CT scan, which I would have thought would have been a priority. I'm actually asking to see an orthopedic specialist anyway because I am a fitness swimmer, and I want to know the best way to deal with having this permanent collarbone dislocation (and also am a little worried about whether the other one would pop out as well) so hopefully, I might get some answers about the joint conditions then.
Anyway, that's all by way of introduction. I have tapered down to 8.5 mg of preds and have stayed the longest at this level as a lot of the aches returned with the taper. this is where so many of the posts here have been so helpful. It is just so hard for me to understand what is normal–and whether I am supposed to be pain free (which I haven't been since I was on 15 mg). I am happy where I am now, with some stiffness in the morning but I can take the dogs out for their morning walk And almost all discomfort except stiffness behind my knees is gone by early afternoon; and there has been weekly improvement to where I am considering another small drop in the next week or so. I guess it is all about finding a personal comfort zone.
I thought I would finally join so that I could say thanks for the collective knowledge and experiences (and occasional needed laughs) which have been so much more helpful than any other source of information!

"Saw my rheumy last week and she wants me to have a PET scan. She said it would show up any inflamation in my body as my blood levels are normal or low.
I did some research when I got home as I knew little or nothing about it. It seems it is used to diagnose some cancers and conditions where other scans were inconclusive. I haven't had any other scans and there was no mention of inflamation in the reasons for referral.
Has anyone else had a PET scan for PMR, or any other reason?
After 8 months I am gradually reducing the pred (now alternating 8 & 9 mg) in the hope of reducing side effects and getting a little of my life back.

"Hi everyone, its been so long since I have posted that I'm sure you dont remember me. I have, however been following all the posts in the last year or so.
I've had a few ups and downs, but I've managed to get down ( at last) to 3mgs pred. My Forsteo injections finished this month (2 years) and I'm still taking the Calci-chew. My rheumy has prescribed Fosamax for the forseeable future and also told me I now have Bursitis in my right hip!! :x This on top of everything else!!
So now to add to pernicious anemia,underactive thyroid, osteoperosis,anemia,ibs and pmr, i now have to try to cope with bursitis!! Sorry, having quite a bad day..
I just want to ask a question and I hope you lovely ladies and gents out there can give me some advice. My rheumy has suggested that,as my esr levels seem to be yo-yo ing and I have to go up and down with the amount of pred I take, I might consider taking mtx.
Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone had any bad experiences?
The reason I ask is that my brother (he has psoriatic arthritis) was put on mtx and thought he was going to die he felt so bad on it and a friend of his who was also put on it thought it was the best thing since sliced bread!!!
Does the effect depend on the person taking it or is it a combination of different drugs being taken at the same time affect the outcome?
Sorry to be on such a downer tonight, havnt felt this bad for a while. Think I'll have a little (well littleish) medicinal brandy and go to bed. :lol:

"Hi Mrs G.
Thought I would reply to your kind enquiry on here as the other site is so busy I sort of get lost! I stayed on 5mgs whilst in Spain, tried a couple of times to go to 4.5mgs but ached all over and didn't see the point of laying on the beach feeling miserable 8) However, since coming back I've dipped my toe in the 4.5mgs bucket and all seems to be well. I tried it once last week and had no reaction at all so will be trying it twice this week. Then I think I'll double my reduction time by doing .5mg over 14 weeks instead of my usual 7. Does that sound a bit whimpish? I'm not in any hurry and I feel so well just now that I don't want to rock the boat. Last time I got to 2.5mgs and felt great until Jake had his op and I went to pieces :lol: Pathetic Nannie or what, but I managed to go no higher than 5mgs. Isn't 5mgs just so comfortable :magic: I've done four days in the garden doing really heavy work, first time I've been able to do that for almost 2 years, so I consider myself very lucky just now. Making the most of it!! I have also felt so much better since I dropped the Omeprazole - I would keep going into a sort of trance and wondered why, but since dropping the Omeprazole it hasn't happened once. Have a lovely day in the field, say hi to my birthday friend and I hope your appointment with the doc goes well!

"Well where did that 4 weeks go I ask myself? Got back last night after a brilliant holiday and a foul journey back (don't try to get round Paris in the rush hour, especially not in monsoon conditions). Handled the journeys well both ways and stayed on 5mgs throughout after a couple of abortive attempts to reduce to 4.5mgs. Laying on the beach, aching everywhere wasn't on my list of 'things to do' while we were away, so soon scrapped that idea. I'll be spending the next couple of days catching up with all the news on here and would love to know how you got on Pauline during your trip to Mazarron. Did you buy? If you did we could be neighbours soon!! One amazing fact while we were away, last year I found out my next door neighbour Jesus had PMR and this trip I find that my opposite neighbour now also has PMR. What are the chances of three people, one Brit, one Spaniard and one French, living withing 10 yards of each other, suffering the same illness? Something in the air? I'm intrigued. The French lady is so poorly just now that she had to cancel her summer trip, so I wasn't able to talk to her personally.

"Thank you for your answers. Now I know I can count on your friendship and understanding. However I still wonder what is waiting ahead.

With 3 pills a day (5 m each) I have no more pain, but my legs are still stiff and walking is difficult and slow. How do you manage? Is a cane necessary? Or a walker? I'd like to know more about your experience. Did any of you recover completely? Is anybody assisting you or is it possible to manage with no help? And what about osteoporosis?
I realize that these are too many questions (sorry!) and that everybody has his/her own story. Anyway I am here, ready and willing to learn as much as possible.

"Somewhere on this site, and I just cannot find it I posted that I was going to take a drop from 3mg to 2.5mg (it was a long posting so I am not going to do it again).
Well, I finally took the drop a week past Saturday and boy did I go through it.
EileenH and MrsO reminded me I had not done the math - it was a 17% drop. Too much in one go so I found out the hardway.
However, by the Friday - back to normal (or what passes for normal) and the drop seems to have worked.
Next time - I am going to do ADT or Ragnar, as 0.5mg to 2mg looks a long way down to me. But I will still 'clear the decks' for the week following the drop.
Oh and I made the 75th Birthday lunch and had a great time.
EileenH or MrsO - I need the math done.
PS I won't lose this post (see title).

"I am scared. My husband died 8 months ago for a sarcoma in his right leg and for more than one year my health was not a real problem, although I had arthritis and osteoporosis. Metaphorically speaking, I became his legs: I was never tired and drove him anywhere he wanted to go. However, some days after his funeral, I realized I could not walk normally. My legs were stiff and I had a lot of pain, that kept me awake at night. I thought it was arthritis, but after some tests I was told I had also polymyalgia.
Now I take 3 pills of prednisone everyday. I hope to get better but I feel to have no future, since I live alone and nobody could help me in case I should need it. So far I manage, but what about tomorrow? Please let me know your experience. Is there some hope to win polymyalgia definitely or will it be my company until I die?

"I have been free from Pred since december 2008. This spring I have felt some fatigue and have gone through a lot of examinations. To-day it is probably 3 months since they started to try to find out what was wrong and I toook a biopsy in my right temple. Exactly six years ago - some days before Midsummer Eve (that we celebrate in Sweden, this year on Friday the 24th) I had my first biopsy in the left temple. That was the final decision that I had pmr and GCA. To-day, the surgeon didn´t think I had any inflammation in the vein where he made the biopsy, and they have tested me for pmr and GCA about three months this time too. I will know in some weeks what the lab says. Somebody asked some time ago about the biopsy. There is nothing to it. I went to the Day Surgery of a main hospital and after a local anaestisia, it probably toook 15 minutes to finish. If the surgeon had found the right type of vein it could have been faster. Now I have a bandage around the head and will take it off to-morrow and just keep the patch for a week. It didn´t hurt at all.
Sometimes, there is a discussion about cutting the tablets and some persons are afraid that the halves or the four pieces won´t be exactly the same size (and strength). Some persons use \""Ragnar´s method\"" and if you follow that, it doesn´t matter if the tablets are not the same size as you spread it out during some days and finally have the full tablet. I used to break the tablets by hand in four pieces.
As I have written before - I think that it is better to be painfree than trying to reduce the pred too fast and possibly get a flare. What is the good thing about lower dosage if you have pain?
I hope that Mrs K is feeling better now that you are preparing to taper to 2 mg. You are helping so many persons by your very instructive answers and I therefore wish you good luck in your own tapering. Also best wishes to your cousin
Ragnar
Good luck all with tapering - there is an end of the tunnel!

"Hi everyone, You may not remember me as it`s so long since I logged on. I told you all last year that my son had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Well I lost him on Feb 28th this year. My brother died last week and I`m at present (with the help of District nurses and Hospice at Home ) caring for my husband who was told there was no hope ten days ago. I find all this hard to put into words but the reason I`m writing is that apart from the horrendous urticaria all over my body, which I`ve had for a year, is to ask if anyone else suffers from upper back pain when they use their arms to do simple things like washing up. I came off pred a few months ago of my own volition as they caused me real problems. Most of the time I can stand the pain but this between my shoulders and round my ribs is agony sometimes and I need to be able to care for John. Hope you`ve all been improving. Shebob

"just been to see my rheumy, well not really, his registra. she tell me she thinks I have psyoratic arthritis and is going to change my meds to methotrexate. I told her I have all the classic symptoms of PMR but does she know better? I am on 7&6 alt days and she says it is too high. I am a bit scared about changing my meds as I am almost pain free still reducing at my own rate and don't want to start back at the begining again. I see the meth. takes up to 12 weeks to work. they won't do a direct change will they or is it a gradual change over

"I would like to offer some encouragement to all you PMR sufferers. This is my first post for over 3 years when I was in despair because of the effects that steroids were having on my stomach. I could see no light at the end of the tunnel. No matter how I tried, I couldn't reduce the dose to below 10mg without the aching starting again and my ESR shooting up. It was over 100 when I was first diagnosed in October 2006! In February this year I finally took my last prednisolone! That was more than 4 years since I began - much longer than the 18 months that I had expected! Over the last 18 months I dropped my dose very, very gradually and after lots of ups and I finally made it. Rather than cutting tablets in half I took a different dose on alternate days e.g 2mg and 1mg. After a month of that I would then take 2mg twice a week and 1mg on the other five days.
I tried to get as much exercise as I could - even when I didn't feel like it I would go for a walk or a swim. Swimming is excellent for PMR and you feel much better afterwards. Aqua-aerobics is also good - the water supports your muscles.
One thing which helped enormously was one of those heated pads - like a mini electric blanket. Sitting in an armchair with that against my back was wonderful - so comforting!
I hope it may help some of you to know that it is possible to recover from PMR - don't despair! A positive mental attitude is also very important in the fight against this miserable disease! Best wishes to all of you

"Hi my friends,
I decided to drop from 23 1/2 by 1 mg, to 22 1/2 ,had 3 /4 days where I felt rough again, but decided to stick it out as it could be withdrawal rather than the return of P.M.R.
As it happens I am feeling so much better, I even managed to wash my kitchen floor today, I am so pleased with myself, how sad is that!!
I even feel like me again,though almost afraid to say so in case I jinx it all.
Next drop will be a half , as I really want to get off these steroids as soon as, but realise it is going to be a long journey.
Just wanted to share this with you, as you have all given me hope, which at one point I really felt that this is it for the rest of my life.
Your stories have been a boon to me.
I see your struggles , & realise they are mine too.together we will overcome this awful condition, & come out the other side stronger.
That is my hopes & wishes for us all.
Love Amycakes.

"A great big hello to you all. I am a new boy!!
I am a 55 year old man from Fareham in hampshire. Until recently I have always been mentally and physically fit, and very young at heart! I worked at a senior Director level in business for many many years and took voluntary early retirement a couple of years ago so I could enjoy life! And then in dec 2010.. an earthquake struck me..well not literally.. in body terms I woke up very pained and very stiff all over. I had no idea what was happening to me, and just put up with it for a couple of weeks. I gradually got worse and worse and was in so much pain that I could barely get out of bed, or out of a chair, every movement hurt, and the extreme pain and stiffness was in my.. neck, shoulders (just like acute frozen shoulder times a 100), hips, thighs, arms, and i felt as though I had an extreme virus feel throughout my entire body (as though my body was under attack), and had stabbing pains in the toes and feet, and at various other parts of the body.
At this point I could take no more. I wont bore you with the details, but suffice to say my GP had little idea what was wrong with me and arranged for lots of blood tests. Most of the results were normal (which I thought was incredible as I was sure I must be at least dying !!), but the standard tests for inflammation were, in the GP words , \""through the roof\"". At least something was wrong then!
The GP referred me to a Rheumatologist. I paid for that to be a private consultation as I thought... I want to be cured by the end of the week please, so if I pay privately all will be quick and well. Yeah Right!!
The rheumatologist referred me also to see a neurologist for lots of other tests, again which I paid privately for (oh how I wish I hadn't done that). The Rheumy consultant said he thought I had polymyositis but would need lots of other tests done first to rule other things out. I had the following tests:
-muscle biopsy
-EMG
-nerve conduction tests
-CT scans of chest and abdomen
-MRI scan of spine
-MRI scan of legs
-more blood tests than your average astronaut would require
and most of which were normal...how refreshing!! The MRI of spine showed signal changes in the spinal muscles, and the blood tests continued to show extremely high inflammation levels. But nothing to confirm what was happening to me. Both the neuro cons and the rheum cons separately said to me, that they were now certain that I had an auto immune disease which was causing a severe....poly... of some sort or another.
Whilst all this was going on, I could hardly move. The rheumy man and my GP discussed the case and put me on 40mg of steroids. Within a few days....wonderful stuff..I could move and was relatively pain free. Yippee I thought there is a god..wow how good did I feel. But I knew nothing of what was to follow. I thought I had been cured, and had no idea of side effects etc. It was worth living once again, and sorry to joke on that point, but in reality during those early weeks I felt so so bad, had no clue what was happening to me, and felt very strongly that I would end it all.
(as sadly I have on many further occasions since). I know that is not the answer but I felt so alone, so isolated, and most tests were 'normal', and had no idea what was wrong with me, and also had no idea that 'I was not alone' and that this forum with the lovely people on it existed.
Anyway, back to my story, and for those that are fed up of reading it already..you are politely excused!! For those that are in it for the long haul.. many thanks for sticking with it!!
To cut a very long story short.. I self medicated with the 40mg steroid dose once I started to put on weight and had more knowledge of long term side effects. Foolishly I thought...maybe the problem has gone away..and stupidly would just stop taking the steroids altogether (predsisolone 40mg daily), and would stop for say a week or so. How very silly and how very naughty. Within days the pain, stiffness etc was back with a vengeance. It hadnt gone at all.
The reheum cons has now said that I do not have polymyostis which is more muscle weakness etc, whereas my problems are inflammation, pain and stiffness of the aformentioned areas. He has fully diagnosed me with PMR (which i had never heard of before), and spoken to me at length re the steroid dose 'rules' etc. He has also said that I will be on meds for a few years at least. He did consider putting me on methotrexate as the immune suppressant and lowering the steroid dose. He has however decided in the first instance to give a maintenance dose of steroids a go to see if that can control the symptoms and only use methotrexate as a last resort. He has decided to trial a reduction of the steroids from 40mg a day to 30 mg a day for a week... and then stay on 30mg for 3 weeks... and then to reduce the dose to 20mg a day thereafter. He feels that due to the severity of my symptoms when not on the meds, that I may need the maintenance dose to be as high as 20mg daily for a year or two, although he would prefer it if my symptoms could 'cope' with the dose being at 10mg or lower which is the tipping point for side effects as the body naturally produces 7.5mg daily. ( wow look at me sounding like an expert..I know very little indeed, this is all based on what the consultant has said to me!!)
All I do know for a fact is... without steroids the PMR is a disaster for me, and I develop such pain and stiffness in the areas mentioned earlier in this note, that life would then be not worth living. But with steroids, a miracle occurs..but why cant they make a tablet with the miracle properties..but without the side effects. Come on drug companies.. sort it out!!
I also accept that the steroids are only treating the symptoms.. and not curing the cause. Which they say is an auto immune problem. Why that happened in the first place they have no idea. They said it could have been caused by a virus, or who knows. Maybe the last 35 years when I was in a hyper stressed business environement, and lived on neat adrenaline, and made my mind full of OCD type behaviour, contributed to the cause, but perhaps I will never know the cause... all I am left with is the PMR now.
In an attempt to try to take something to help the immune system out, whilst taking steroids, I went to an alternative health practitioner, (forgot what they are called now..is that steroids, PMR, or an addled brain!!) who prescribed zincum 200mg tablets. Didnt work sadly. So my latest quest is I have ordered from Spain (oh the wonders of the internet) a natural PMR remedy (wonderful claims made ) some tablets called Gemlarex.Prob wont work either but hey I thought I would give it a try. Also trying some exercise (gym bike, gym running machine, and gym weights ) but that seems to make me worse in terms of pain and stiffness but I must try something.
Sorry if this has rambled on a bit... but I thought I would log my exepriences, especially as you all sound so so nice, and I thought I was alone in this. I now feel as though I have found an all new family, a family that understands and has a shared experience.
I hope so much that I can learn from you all, and if there is ever a local support group ever set up maybe one day I may meet some of you. I wont be negative I promise, I will keep those feelings to myself.. I will be fun, happy and supportive.. and if the steroids havent worked that day I am sure a nice pint or two will lighten the mood!!
Thank you all for being there.
Very kind regards
Rob

"Hi to you all.
Not posted for a while. I know its no excuse at all for not writing, but maybe it's because I am feeling very much better at the moment and almost got my life back.
Since I last wrote on here, I have reduced the Preds to 5mg, and touch wood I have had no pain or flare ups. I seem to be feeling so much better in myself too with each reduction, which is great.
Like many others I would like to get off the steroids as my PMR allows it, but I realise that I could end up taking a very low dose for quite a long time.
I know everyone is different in their own personal needs, but my questions are:
What is considered to be in general a 'reasonable level' of preds to end up taking?
And how long would I be expected to take it for?

"Have just returned from a very frustrating appointment with my GP. He appears to be much more concerned with how the pred reduction is going than the PMR itself. Although I have reduced from 15 to 10mgs in about 5 months, it is becoming harder each time as I appear to have fairly severe withdrawal symtoms. Thank you Eileen H for your very useful post on pred reduction. at least I am aware that it is withdrawal and not the dreaded PMR flare up. Because of this site I was able to tell him that after I get to 9mg I will be reducing by 1/2mg a time. Those of you who have got clued up doctors, hang on to them!

"Hi,
We're off to Spain at the crack of dawn (actually before it cracks, 3am start due to feeling fit and well back in November when we booked the ferry!). Have been feeling pants for two weeks but now feeling a lot better since going back up to 5mgs. Seems to suit me. I managed to get 2.5mg and 5mg enteric coated Pred from the Doctor this time as I think the Omeprazole was making me feel ill - I read the side effects and seemed to be able to tick most of them. Since stopping a week ago I feel much, much better. Coincidence? Don't know, don't care, just feel better!! Yoghurt doesn't quite work for me and if I take the non enteric it feels as thought I have a rodent chewing at my insides. On that delightful note I shall say Adios 8)
Take care everyone

"Hi All,
Havent felt well as I said before ,shortness of breath & rapid pulse rate ,so went to see my G.P. on friday, she referred me to the M.A.U.in our hospital,due to my past blood clots, where they did all sorts of tests, chest xray, e.c.g ,checked for chest infection , water infection etc.
Anyway nothing untoward found, but no reason why I should have been breathless.
The hospital stopped my 1.25 bisoprolol,thinking it may be causing my fatigue, though I know its the P.M.R.
Anyway on Monday I still felt rough, so while at the surgery for my husbands blood tests, I managed to speak with my G.P. bless her she called me into her office & checked me over again.
She thought the lack of bisoprolol for 3 days may have caused the rapid pulse etc.so told me to take it again.
Also said to up my steroid dose .
So took 25mg today.
Will carry on with this dosage for at least 2 weeks maybe a month.
Then a VERY slow drop, by half or one mg.each time.
As you can guess I am very down & tearful, sympathise with you all if you too are feeling like me at the mo'
Thanks for taking the time to read my message.

"Hi Everybody,
Have had a virus or so the doc thinks, absolutely wiped out.
Had no sneezes, no chest infection , no water infection, so what virus I havent a clue.
Temperature was a bit raised, told to take paracetamol.
Had bloods done when nurse called to house, took 3 of them to actually get the blood, I am always trouble with a capital t when it comes to giving bloods.
Anyway most have come back, they said C.RP normal? whatever that means , still waiting on E.S.R & others.
By the way my husband didnt have P.M.R after all, he just sprained his back,are we delighted or what!!
Then he fell in the garden chasing a cat away who had killed birds before, so hoping to extend our net fencing to keep this particular cat out.
So his back pain & now his leg is back again.
I keep telling him he is 69 not 29.but will he listen.
Anyway I am still on 23 1/2 pred, hoping to reduce again soon, waiting to feel better over this virus, at least I am up & dressed today.
Felt really low again , tearful etc, but knowing you are all sufferig too has helped .
Hang in there , I do appreciate you being there.

"Hi all,
I had a review with my rheumy this morning....not a good one :cry: .
Truth be told, I haven't felt great for the last month and I DID limp in as my right knee has been sore for over a week :roll: , but I thought I could cope and at least I was down to 9mgs RIGHT,:? :wink: .
WRONG.....Esr was back up to 22 (4 in Feb) and CRP was 34 (had been 5).
He drew 30mls of fluid from my knee before giving me a steroid injection...I think I had been denying that it was swollen :shock: .
Anyway, the bottom line is that he thinks that PMR may be the wrong diagnosis and that I have \""Inlammatory / Rheumatoid \"" arthritis.
He said my best chance of getting remission and not causing long term joint damage is the Methorexate, as the steroids at an acceptable dose simply will not work, so with a heavy heart, I accept that I will have to give it a shot. I have to get base-line blood test results before I start on it so will probably have my first dose sometime next week, then tests every 4 weeks to make sure all is well.

"It is perhaps 18 months since I last posted on this forum, but I follow all the threads with interest and derive a lot of comfort and many smiles too from the incredibly caring people who post regularly. 69y, previously very fit and active, diagnosed 2 ys ago, I started on 20mg reducing to current 3.5 mg currently, following a version of Ragnars regime throughout the taper. Stressful family crisis sent blood markers up a little last year, so had a temporary return to 10mg from 7mg and then tapered back down. My problem is, although most of the stiffness has gone (I can still play 9 holes of golf occasionally and garden a little on most days), my pain levels have never really reduced that much. I have a fairly high pain tolerance, yet I have needed Cocodamol x 2 four times a day, and recently as a result of being referred to the local Pain Management Clinic, now use Oramorph for breakthrough pain that gets in the way of day-to-day life.
When I was under the care of the Pain Management Clinic the aim was to try to find a form of pain relief that did not depend on medication. They gave me a course of ten acupuncture sessions which did little to affect the pain. I have a TENS machine which causes some diversion when the pain is more achy/muscular, than the spasm/nerve type pain. In the end, they came to the conclusion that in order to be relatively comfortable, I should take Oramorph when the pain breaks through my usual pain medication. I have been using Oramorph once or twice later in the day, on most days, and then I can be relatively pain-free for a few hours. Of course, like the rest of you, I have those wonderful times when for no explicable reason, I am pain free without the need for extra medication, and raise false hopes that the ‘beast’ has gone!
Of course, describing pain to another person is almost impossible, but in essence I have a cape of deep nervy/creepy/spasmy pain around my shoulders, neck and rib area, but with more intensity on the left side often stretching down to my left buttock. Walking around and moderate activity eases the pain, indeed often clears it, but of course soon exhausts the limited energy supply, so that is not a viable solution. The most pain is felt during sitting. Lying absolutely flat is the most comfortable, next to exercising, but when the pain is at its worst is still not sufficient. I have a wonderful chiropractor (who is well up on PMR and in fact initially told me to go and see my GP as she was sure I had PMR) who keeps my poor abused back fairly mobile (the penalties we pay for an active and varied sporting life!). She seems to think the majority of the pain is PMR related and not as a result of mechanical defects.
My GP is also very sympathetic, and recognises that my pain is not reflected by the consistently low ESR/CRP readings (the only time they were in double figures was on diagnosis). She lets me manage the way in which I reduce, as long I as continue to reduce, and is aware of the 10% rule, provides me with a supply of 5mg.2.5mg and 1mg Pred as needed, has agreed that I should stop AA in light of its bad reputation, and makes sure I have an annual DEXA scan. I rather think, she too, is at a loss as to know what to do next, as to get to be pain free, I guess I would have to go back to about 20+ mg and that is not acceptable to either of us, as, however slow I go, anything less than that and the pain reappears (although happily not the stiffness).
I don’t feel so alone now I’ve shared my whinge, so thank you for ’ listening’ and any helpful advice would be appreciated.

"As regulars will know, the last few weeks have been quite a stressful journey and my 18 month uneventful reduction to 2.5mgs was suddenly disrupted! I've finished up on 4mgs (quite pleased with that, thought I would have to go higher) and have stayed on that dose for almost three weeks. The dreadful fatigue and depression (weeping over the death of Seve Ballesteros as though he was my twin brother! :wah: ) have gone and just a few 'background' aches that were there years before the PMR struck. My question: from your experience how long do you think I should stick to the 4mgs? I'm thinking another week then try 3.5mgs on my 7 week regime as before. I don't want to do it too quick, on the other hand I'd quite like to start reducing again. As an aside, when Jake was in ICU I promised him a trip to London when he felt better. Can you believe we went yesterday (just 5 weeks after his operation :doctor: !). Train to London, underground to Madam Tussauds, Covent Garden and The London Eye. I have to admit that by the time we got to the Eye he was wilting but the very nice man in uniform let us go through 'Fast Track' so we managed to complete our day out.

"Good news at the Drs today Bloods were really good and my salt levels were back in the normal range
On 3mg and will be going to 2.5 next I did mention all the things I had read about AA and she did say a lot of people were having reflux and osophigal problems She said the guidlines hadnt been changed yet but she though they might She also said that she has a patient with osophigal cancer who blames it on the AA
Had a great Nordic walk in the sunshine today so hoping I just carry on in ths way
For everyone who is struggling you can get there I am now 2 yrs 5months in and this is the best I have felt so unfortunately patience is sometimes required !!

Cannot find where I found info on Manuka Honey now, so can anyone tell me what its special for?
I believe its something to do with the immune system?
How much do you take of it? Spread on toast or spoonful or what?

"I haven't been on here in weeks so thought I would catch up.
So glad to hear it isn't GCA, Jay D. I agree with the others - change of doc would seem appropriate.
For those of you who remember, i was having problems with a run of bursitis, excess mucus affecting my breathing etc.. Well, I took the antibiotics and asthma inhaler ny GP gave me - the antibiotics seemed to improve the breathing but the inhaler didn't. I have now determined the problem is coming from acid reflux.
The night of the Royal Wedding, my father was rushed into hospital in Plymouth with what turned out to be pneumonia, lack of oxygen in blood, and fluid on lungs from a worsening heart valve condition. He is nearly 88. He is also still on Pred for PMR- has been for years. We had to rush down there and I then took a week off work (difficult in term-time when you teach) as my miother isnt really safe at home - she overbalances.
He is back at home now and quite a bit better but still weak and has gone down to 7 and half stone (not clever in itself).
Would you believe it, the moment I got home after that week, I went down with raging cystitis and had to go to see a GP at the local out of hours surgery (didn't know such a thing existed before). So then had to have a 2nd course of antibiotics in 2 weeks! Interestingly, my chest problem improved substantially after that so i do think I had an infection there - still a bit of mucus but in a different league.
Have been back to work for 2 weeks now but am feeling SO exhausted all the time - partly anxiety about my father probably but I think I am also run down.
What a tale of woes - but that is why I havent been on here! I feel decrepit before my time and want to retire.

"Hi guys, I'm new to this site but have to say that over the last few weeks your info especially about Prednisilone has been invaluable....quite frankly I dont know what I would have done without your comments about lowering dosage etc. Ive been off work for 4 months now but only in the last couple of weeks has anybody put a name to my illness. From very early on I thought I had Polymyalgia but my doctor insisted I did not. After going to opticians and getting specs replaced in November 2010 and having a second opinion in Feb that my eyesight was fine the optician wrote to my doc to suggest I was referred to an Opthalmist because of the pain in my right eye and head. I had a Temperal Artery biopsy which returned a negative result this coupled with the fact that my ESR was only 20 convinced him that I wa suffering from nothing more than 'Neck and Face' pain !! If only!! To cut a lonnnnnng story short he prescribed 15mg of Pred but when this didnt work upped it to 30mg. He told me to take 15mg in the a.m and 15mg in the p.m (before 3 oclock as I wouldnt sleep at night) He failed to tell me that I was only supposed to do this for a couple of days so for 9 weeks I have been taking medication incorrectly Now trying to reduce dose is playing havoc with me..I felt so ill sometimes, as he told me to reduce by 5mg daily with the result I couldnt even get out of bed and couldnt understand why. It was only due to talking to PMR helpline that I found out what was wrong and confronted him with my new found knowledge to which he replied I was supposed to take them all in the a m in one hit. ( he hadnt told me that bit) My concern now is that the pain in my head and eye appears to get worse by the day I have blurred vision double vision and tender scalp but he still says I dont have GCA. Im terrified I'll go blind at any minute but Im sure I read somewhere that if you have this disease there is no pain in eyes. Does anyone know if this is true? After much pleading I now have Rheumy appointment but thats not til next month and the wait is torture. Do any of you PMR sufferers get these horrible pains in head and eyes? I am very scared as it seems no one will take me seriously. My company sent me to private doctor in an effort to help me and the only thing that makes me feel any better is that he said he thought there would be a significant change (i.e I would have developed far more serious symptoms by now if I had GCA. Your information has as I said been invaluable to me ,can any of you reassure me in any way? Im sorry to ramble on but its been a horrible road to travel and I can see that I havent travelled it alone!!
Thank you again for ypor help and advice
Best wishes to you all and hopes for better days

"Started a new thread as this is a slightly different query.
I've just been sent the very good yellow leaflets produced byPMRGCAuk. Lots of good stuff but, to quote:-
\""Gradual reduction to maintemance dose of 5 to 8mg per day(may take several months).\""
I have never had the idea of a maintenance dose for PMR - I just thought that one kept on reducing slowly, and comfortably, until one reached a point where symptoms, hopefully, had vanished. Am I being stupid or misunderstanding something? :? :?

It was hard because my work is working with 3 and 4 yr olds so it is not only mentaly demanding but physically as well. Dropped from 25 mg to 20 mg then to 18 mg, it didnt like it so went back up to 20 mg waited a bit and tried 19 mg still didnt like it. Back to being off sick, muscles not working and back up to 25 mg waiting on an appointment to see the Rheumatologist at the hospital in June.

"Ive been lucky and had a long time on the swings; things seemed to be going very well and the only thing I wasn't looking forward to was a session at the dentist next month! I had the Pred down to 2.5 (for 7 weeks) and the Methotrexate down to 15 and was looking forward to announcing this news to all and sundry.
I went for a routine check at the doc surgery yesterday as I know I will have to have some tooth extractions and wanted to make sure that everything was OK before the event.........it turns out not!
I couldn't see my usual doctor as he is on extended leave (how very dare he) so I chose one of the female doctors and girls! have I hit pay dirt!
She is young but amazingly [i:c2c48675fa]very[/i:c2c48675fa] clued up on both PMR and GCA, knew just what was what and so I know I am going to stick like glue to her in the future.
The only thing I had to complain of was the increasing pain which seemed to be coming from the top of my spine/base of the skull. That has been a tender spot for years and I have always put it down to my dancing days (ballroom dancing does not keep your neck in a good position, or your left shoulder, come to that). At times - and only at times - the pain was radiating up the left side of my neck and up into my ear and jaw but was not a constant problem and my left side has always been the worst, e.g. my left eye has always had poorer vision than the right.
She gave me a thorough going-over and then broke the news to me that in her opinion it was the GCA making its presence felt and that there was no option other than to raise the Pred up to 40mg at least while further tests were done. I was so totally stunned, I hardly remember getting home, but what I had realized was that after last year's little episode, I couldn't do this without making my Rheumy at least aware of the problem. Although she had said she was going to write to him, I felt that the letter might not get there quickly enough!
I phoned the Rheumatology unit and spoke to a very calm young lady who managed to unscramble my somewhat incoherent babble, took all the details and told me one of the nurses would call me back very shortly. Again, I was surprised because she also seemed to recognise the need for speed where GCA is concerned. Bless his cotton socks, the Rheumy himself phoned and it has been agreed that I stay on the 40mg until Mon/Tues when he will call me again to find out what the immediate response has been. Sensible man - I'm hanging on to him as well.
So there it is........whatever happens I am back on the roundabout of Pred reductions (or not) and I have no idea what happens when you've got someone who needs a high dose of steroids but isn't supposed to have them, but I have this feeling that I am going to find out.
At least I am spared the shock of finding out unwittingly what a high dose will do to me. After all this time I know the worst and if some of it doesn't happen this time round, it will be a bonus.
Sorry for the long post, but I'm in need of a little TLC from those who understand best!

I have been to see a private GP who is also an experienced homeopath to try to unravel all my issues.
The huge problem I have with chest congestion, mucus, breathing etc has been put down to acid reflux by my GP but this chap thought it is probably asthma. I am not having any of the traditional reflux symptoms, you see.
He asked me to get my GP to prescribe the brown preventative inhaler (which contains steroid), take it for a month then come back.
What do you think?? He said it wouldn't increase my steroid \""load\"" as it is inhaled.

"This is probably a question to which I should know the answer. Advice, info most welcome.
Three days ago I was potting some tomato plants and gave my back a really painful wrench. There was no weight lifting involved, just using a light plastic shovel to dig into the sack. I know perfectly well that the quite severe pain is not PMR but added to what I already have is really getting me down a bit.
Rest versus movement? I cannot decide. If I sit still for long it's hard to get going; if I potter about then my back aches horribly and it didn't help when I picked up our rather heavy cat to put into his bed-time place.
Have I just been unlucky? Stupid? or are we PMR people more likely to suffer these injuries? All/ suggestions/experiences/remedies/advice welcomed.
Take care all of you. BettyE

My doctor has been very good and is quite happy for me to reduce at my own pace, but believes the blood results are the most important factor, but I have been reading this forum for some time! When you mention relapses do you mean going back to when you couldnt turn over in bed etc. Do you reach a stage when there is no pain at all.

"Hi Mrs G
I dont post very often but I have had PMR for three years now and on steroids for 2 years and 8 months. This time has flown although it has not been without its ups and downs. I only have had it once thank goodness but who knows. I am on 5mg at the moment. Last August I got down to 3.5 and the had a blib and had to go back to 7.5 and it has taken me all this while just to get back to 5mg. Like you and reading the posts I have taken it really slowly in reducing, probably too slowly but I dont want another relapse. I think I may try and reduce 1/2mg every 2-3 weeks obviously depending on how I go. I am still working and I dont think this helps because if I have a bad day instead of taking it easy I have to plod on.
Still the sun is shining and it is going to be a lovely day so we can all enjoy. I enjoy reading all your posts and follow with interest, there are some amazing characters amongst you all and one thing that comes through is that we are all busy people, which obviously hits us harder.

Nothing I would bother with, but I am a little hesitant in going down on preds too quickly. When is the time to take a small drop ? Is it when after a few days or a couple of weeks on one dose, and no more pains are felt in the morning ? You are so wise about all this ! I am NOT going near any of the doctors at my surgery. You seem to know about PMR much more than they do ! I have no blood tests, or anything like that. I am feeling quite OK. All I want to make sure, is, that I do not go down on Preds so quickly, that those horrendous pains come back !....Hope I am not too much trouble...Have a LOVELY EASTER and enjoy how lucky you are in feasting your eyes on such beautiful panoramas....Love.

guess what---I've fallen and broken my left wrist. Been walking on The Roaches in Staffordshire, which are steep and rocky, and waited until I was \""safely\"" back on the road, and went crashing down on the tarmac with my arm under me, (no footpath) It was a single break and was sorted by manipulation. I'm plastered to the elbow, what a hoot---never broken a bone before!! Cannot drive of course until the plaster comes off in 6 weeks oh joy!! I'm such a sure footed person usually, and am really cross with myself, not least because I've now given ammunition to the medics to shoot me down for not taking AA. My Dexa scan at the end of Jan was normal, I take calcium and Vit D supplement, and am obsessive about eating a very high calcium diet. The PMR seems to have taken a back seat btw, I think it's been frightened off ha ha. I cannot speak highly enough of the Doctor, nurses and radiographers who attended me in A and E at the local hospital, for their kindness, care and efficiency. Tell you what, it's amazing what you can achieve with 1 hand and your teeth!!
Hope you are all soaking up this glorious sunshine, and having a pain free day.

"Hi all.
As the title says, just a quick progress update on my Pred reduction from 15mg.
I have been taking 12.5mg (and not 10mg, as my doctor oringinally instructed) for a week. I am feeling ok, very good in fact, and pain free during the day.
However, the leg pain is still there last thing at night after inactivity, and first thing in the morning after sleeping.
That hasn't changed that much, so I am maybe thinking that the doctor is right, and that it may be something else and not the PMR pain.
It's a bit annoying, but if I prgress ok with my gradual Pred reductions and have no pain during the day, then maybe I can live with it.
I think I may do another week on 12.5mg and then try to reduce to 10mg and see how it goes.
Fingers still tightly crossed.

I am starting to reduce from 2.5mg without using the 1mg tablets because of my stomach. I've managed ok from 5 down to 2.5 that way (very slowly - took since October). It means that today, for the first time I have taken NO steroids (doing 2 weeks of 2.5 for 6 days and 0 for 1 day).
I have been feeling a little achey at the top of my arms and shoulders and the top of my thighs all day. I am determined that the PMR will NOT come back but am scared about what I might wake up to in the morning! Is the Pred out of your system after 24 hrs or does some stay longer??

"Haven't posted for while but drop in for a read a couple of times a week. I'm still not on steroids though I've taken a couple of 5 day courses when having to drive a long way or have dental surgery done. The pain and stiffness seems to respond well enough to Neurophen. And I've been feeling good till I hit a blip last week.
In a routine blood check my calcium was slightly high and so was my parathyroid hormone (PTH) reading. On a follow up reading two weeks later, my calcium was still up a little but my PTH was within normal limits.
My doctor ordered a scan at the nuclear medicine facility for next week. I did a bit of digging and found the most likely cause of the blood results is an adenoma (benign tumour) on one or more of the parathyroid glands.
But I wonder could it be somehow connected with PMR? Has anyone else had something similar? Some of the symptom of both are the same.
There's also a connection between high PTH and vitamin D? And I had just finished a booster dose and my Vit D levels are now within the optimal range on the US scale. I'm kinda hoping that's it but even if it is I might only have myself to blame for messing with the delicate balance of the PTH system and calcium because the calcium's coming from somewhere and it's not my diet.
I'd be grateful for any feedback or information anyone has.
What a journey this is. Jill

"I wonder if you poor suffers of thyroid problems can answer a query for me please?
Before being diagnosed with either an underactive or overactive thyroid, did anyone have symptoms such as a dry mouth, on and off hoarseness of voice or swollen glands?
I have finally been for my hospital appointment today to investigate my swollen salivary glands. I was most upset as when I received the appointment letter I rang for confirmation of which consultant I would be seeing and was happy when it was confirmed as someone I knew to be highly recommended. However, I did not see an actual consultant at all but aftebeing sent for a dental X-ray was seen by one of his assistants, a very nice young lady but obviously inexperienced and after examining me she went to relay my answers to her questions to the consultant and to ask him whether I should have a C.T scan or an MRI. I told her I didn't want a CT scan with dye because that, I know, can be harmful to my low filtering sole kidney. An MRI is being arranged but she also queried my thyroid and I have now had a blood test for that.
So this has been going on, as you all know, for three months now and I now have to wait another few weeks before the scan and again for a further appointment (the Appointments Desk wouldn't make the appointment before I left today as they said it was fully booked up!) I queried with her as to whether there could be any link with GCA or, as my GP suggested, Sjogren's Syndrome, but felt I may as well not have bothered because she didn't have any answers!
I'm sorry this isn't a PMR subject but I know some of you are thyroid sufferers and I would be very grateful if you can give me any advice, please.

"Went to hospital today with my sleeves metaphorically rolled up ready to do battle :lol:
He was running an hour late and had students with him :roll: :roll:
One lady came storming out shouting what a rude man he was!!!!! Oh joy :roll: :roll:
I was the last to go in and was with him for some time....... I did let him know how unimpressed I was with his poor management of me with the fast reduction from 15mg to 10mg....did he apologise.... not :? .... after a long discussion on how things had been etc plus I owned up and told him about the Alendronic Acid business where I had thought I was having a heart attack on two subsequent weeks after taking it ( he told me I had done the right thing and stopped taking them!) he decided he was not happy at all with how things were going and requested I had a whole battery of bloods to screen for 'everything' and he requested an appt to be sent for me to have a CAT scan :roll: :roll: When I questioned this he explained he needed to be sure that there was not something underlying the PMR before he went on to tackle my 'discomfort'.
So I have to return in four weeks for the results of everything and have been told NOT to reduce any further and to stay on the 16mg until he sees me in a month.
Also had my DEXA scan today...... three wonderful hours in a hot hospistal with the sun shining outside...... exhausted when I got home and beyond eating at three in the afternoon, having missed lunch. Thankful for the latte in the hospital cafeteria prior to going to sit in his clinic :roll:
Off to climb into bed with my hot chocolate and a book and I presume lights out before too long...... :lol:

"Dear All,
I am a sixty three year old male always in good health and active(but not a keep fit type), 5' 10\"" 11 stone.
At the age of 43 I had acute abdominal pain that was not food related and despite extensive medical checks no cause was identified, I now consider that the problem MAY have been appendix related.
At the age of 61 I decided to introduce some exercise into my daily routine which included sit ups. Weeks after this new routine and over a period of weeks and months I developed pains in my shoulders and knees to the extent that I initially could not take of my jersey over my shoulders and could not rise out of my chair. ( I NOW CONSIDER THAT THESE EXERCISES AGGRAVATED MY APPENDIX) Having taken no more than a few bottles of pain killers over my lifetime I was now consuming maximum doses per day and the debilitating effect left me withe the view that having given the best years of my life to an employer my life in retirement was being stolen from me and I felt cheated.
Blood tests identified problems and eventually PMR was diagnosed and Prednisolone was effective in transforming me to normality. At the age of 62 I suffered an acute abdominal attack that resulted in my appendix being removed ( which was inflamed ) and ALL the underlying niggles of my condition have disappeared and I am confident that my reducing dose of Prednisolone (currently 2mg) will see me completely clear of this condition.
Apart from any thoughts that may arise from this post It would be interesting to identify what proportion of PMR sufferers still have their appendix !

"Last week, my dosage of Prednisolone was reduced fron 7mgs to 6mgs and all was well for three days. I was then hit with a return of the pain in my hips and thighs and could hardly bear to move. However, the pain is not as bad today and I was wondering if this because my body is getting used to the lower dose, although this has never happened before on my trip down from a starter of 15mgs. Anyone else experienced similar?

"Dear All,
As a current PMR sufferer can I suggest a completely unorthodox and in no way scientifically or even quack endorsed by any shape of the imagination a test to determine if you have PMR. If you are currently NOT I repeat NOT on steroids and wondering if you may have PMR I would consider the following test as a POSSIBLE indicator.
The set up.
Arrange to have a large star headed screw inserted into a solid piece of wood and driven fully 'home' to the extent that it would be difficult to drive it any further.
Use a screwdriver that preferably has an oval handle but any one will suffice.
The test is as follows.
This should be carried out initially by a fit person.
Try to screw the screw further into the wood by an increasingly stronger 'TWIST' and then when it is obvious that it is not posible to turn the screw in any further GRADUALLY release the pressure and remove the screwdriver from the screw, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO LET THE SCREWDRIVER SLIP WHILST DOING THIS. The objective here is to demonstrate that the muscle strentgh is good and I repeat try and get as much torque as possible when carrying out this step.
Now carry out the same procedure and try and screw the screw in as hard as you can but then ease back on the forward pressure so that the screwdriver slips out of the screwhead whilst still maintaining the torque when you are exerting the maxmum force and see if you find it painful when the screwdriver slips out.
NOTE, CARRY THIS TEST AT AT YOUR OWN RISK I can state that the excruiating pain will not last very long
Jim.

"Hello one and all
I nearly fell off my chair just now when I opened up my post :thepost: (think I've beaten you to this emoticon, Lizzie :lol: ) to find a letter and form from my rheumatologist asking for input regarding my personal symptoms, experiences and issues with PMR and its treatment including good and bad experiences.
Wow after 5 years I think I'm going to have a field day!
Apparently this is likely to be followed with a face to face group meeting next month with an educational focus.
So, good news, girls! It's so reassuring to know that PMR somewhere along the line is being taken seriously.
BTW, one of the good experiences I will list will definitely be this forum including the wonderful support groups across the country (PMR Fighters especially! :D ).

"Hi all,
Is it normal to feel less pain the more active you are?
I have always thought that plenty of rest was recommended for sufferers of PMR.
With me it seems the more active I am, the less pain I experience, and resting up just makes me ache.
Am I going against the grain here?..Or maybe I really have'nt got PMR at all! :wink:

"I was just diagnosed with PMR two weeks ago. For three or four weeks I had been dealing with severe muscle and joint pain in my shoulders, arms, hips, quads and glutes. The pain was so bad in the morning that I could hardly get out of bed. Then I couldn't shower or wash my hair until late in the afternoon when I loosened up a bit. Even then I could get only one arm above my head -- using the other arm to help lift the other arm. Dressing was difficult and had to give up wearing T-shirts [i:71a240ec32](don't know how the ladies put on those things that have to be fastened in the back?? tee hee)[/i:71a240ec32].
Two months ago I injured my right shoulder when lifting my mom from the seat of my car to a wheel chair. Xray and MRI showed extreme tendinitis and bursitis in three areas of my RT shoulder - but no tear. I have been doing physical therapy for treatment of this. All of a sudden things started to get worse where it seemed the tendinitis had spread. This didn't make sense. Then I noticed pain in my hip joints when getting in and out of the car. One morning after struggling to get out of bed, I couldn't reach the faucet to turn on water to brush my teeth. I thought I was going crazy!
After researching \""muscle/joint pain\"" on the internet, I stumbled on what I thought might be the cause... a possible side effect to taking Lipitor - a statin to lower cholesterol. I'd been on that for a year and a half. I called my internist (GP) who told me to stop the Lipitor and ordered some blood tests to confirm. Those tests (CK and Aldolase) came back normal. My Physical therapist is the one who suggested I see a Rheumatologist because she knew something else had to be going on. Last week I saw a Rheumy. After a pelvic X-ray (showed normal) and a physical exam, he said he needed to run some blood tests. He was pretty sure I had PMR because I had the classic symptoms. He suggested I start on Prednisone - a medium dose of 10mg after breakfast and 10mg after dinner. He said if I started to feel better it would help confirm his diagnosis. In just 24 hrs. I felt about 30% better. After two days I was 50% better. Now after one week of 20 mg daily I'm what I'd consider to be 80% better! A couple of days ago I actually walked on the treadmill for the first time in many weeks. I only did one mile as my hips started to feel a bit sore - but not too bad. Will take it easy for a bit.
At my Dr's followup yesterday he said he was 98% confident in the PMR diagnosis. My blood work showed CRP1 high @ 6.4 (inflammation); ERC or Sed rate was 85. He also said the CBC tests showed I was borderline anemic. My TSH (Thyroid function) and RA (Rheumatoid factor) both showed normal (2.35 and 6 respectively). The Dr. wants me to stay on 20mg/day for another 3 weeks. After 3 weeks he'll run the blood tests again and will hopefully be able to start lowering my Pred dosage. From reading some of the stories on different forums, it sounds like you shouldn't lower Pred too fast. I'm sure not happy about the possible side effects of Prednisone. It does cause me some heartburn (I take Prilosec OTC @ dinner), possible elevated blood pressure (already hypertensive) and eye pressure elevation (I already have glaucoma)... not to mention the osteoporosis risk. I asked the Rheumy how long PMR usually lasts. He said between 6 mos. and 6 years. Yikes!
I'm retired so don't have to work for a living. Thank God for that. Don't know how some are able to keep working with acute muscle pain. It's got to be very difficult. I'm an amateur musician and had to give up playing my horn for awhile because it weighs 10#. I just started back to play and hopefully will be able to continue. I do feel some bicep pain after playing for only 15 minutes.
___________
A few questions...
1) Is it normal to have trouble getting back to exercise? Two days ago I started back on the treadmill and quit after only 20 mins or 1 mile. The next day my hip joints felt like I had run a marathon so I skipped the next day's exercise. Today 2 hours after breakfast (& Ppred) I walked for 30 mins or 1.7 miles... my usual daily exercise. My hips are a bit sore again. I'm thinking it just takes time to get used to exercising again. Is this correct?
2.) My internist (or GP) advised me to get back on statin drug (Lipitor 20mg). He said since my Adolase and CK tests were normal, that the statin couldn't be the cause. I noticed in a survey that quite a number of PMR suffers had been taking a statin to lower their cholesterol before acquiring PMR. I think in was on Elliott's survey, but can't find it now. Is it safe to go back on statins? If so, do you also take CoQ10 supplement to counteract the effects of the statin depleting this enzyme?
Thanks.

"Hi everyone I have to share my experience of the day. This morning i switched on my computer to come in here and read up on all the messages and out of the corner of my eye I could see something moving across the floor. My first thought was \""mouse\"" my second thought \""Vole\"" I jumped out of the chair gave the thing a fright it shot under the TV cabnit. So I quickly shut the living room door to keep the thing in the room, but left the back door open so it it might go out the way it came in. I pulled everything in the room all over the place and could not find the thingy. My chap called an hour later and he ran me to the shop I got a glue trap for the thingy it is suspossed to walk on the glue and then I would take it out in the garden , well this was 14 hours ago and I still can not find the thingy as he/she is not standing on the glue traps. Jeepers I need a drink I will never sleep tonight I am going to make sure I lock this living room door before I go to bed.
The big question is did I see it really or did i imagine it ha ha, I did see it and wish i had not mind you on reflection it is better that I saw it. Better to be on my guard so on a funny note not only have I got the PMR i now have a thingy roaming round here somewhere lol :twisted: :evil: :oops:

"Hello everyone
Everyone will already know that I drink a glass of warm water with squeezed lemon juice first thing which is great for a detox and helpful for reflux as the acid turns ankaline in the stomach. For those of us anticipating indulging in the traditional pancakes today, here is an interesting article from today's Mail:
[u:ff4927b43f]Foods that are better when eaten together[/u:ff4927b43f]
Squeeze lemon juice on today's Pancake Day pancakes for stronger bones.
Pancakes are made with milk, a good source of bone-building calcium. If you produce too little stomach acid, however, the calcium remains insoluble and can't be absorbed.
On average we only absorb about 30 to 50 per cent of calcium from our diet - this is particularly a problem as we get older because stomach acid production decreases with age.
Pouring acidic lemon juice over pancakes boosts the acidity in our gut, and so helps increase calcium absorption.
Lemon juice is also thought to stimulate enzymes and digestive juices in the stomach that can further enhance the absorption of calcium.
So we can all enjoy our pancakes knowing that it is helping those bones as well. :D

"Defining a friend
Hi there everyone it has been a while just wanted to let you know i am doing OK.
I called to see my My friend for a cup of tea and she has a visitor staying at hers so she introduced me etc. It was one of my not so good days lolanyway after a few minutes it was obvious to me that her visitor knew all about my condition so I was a bit miffed about this as I did not even know this person. Because I was not feeling to good they both started telling me what I should be doing etc \""as if they would know\"" They nagged me so much I was nearly in tears so I left leaving the tea.
A few days later I was feeling good so went out in the back garden to cut the grass and do some work there. I did a little then sat down with a cup of tea and then did some more, pacing myself. My friend came round the back and said to me. \""you must be feeling good seen as you are out here working, I expect you do not have PMR whatever that is anyway.
I responded by saying \""well you and your visitor seemed to know all about PMR the other day, what's changed since then? She said well no good me giving you advice as you would not listen.I had to point out that she knows nothing about PMR so is not qualified to give me advice etc.
I don't want to fall out with her but she is driving me crazy and I'm not sure how much more of her sarcastic comments I can take and what I can't understand me is why a so called friend can be so unkind when I am not feeling to well
Ok Rant over I hope you are all feeling well or as well as can be.

"Once again, I feel a twinge of guilt with my good news as so many of you are suffering just now, but I simply have to share it. I have just been discharged from the Hospital :lol: My lovely, lovely Consultant was so pleased with me, she gave me a big hug :hug: My ESR and CRP were 2, although in all honesty, they've never been hugely raised. She said to come off the Alendronic Acid and Omeprazole - I had to admit that I had done this myself and she said she was pleased that I listened to my body and made my own decisions. I'm due to reduce to 2mgs next week and she's very confident that I'll come off the Pred completely. Its never been my main goal, just want to feel well on the lowest dose I can manage, so 'nil' would be a big bonus. I've slowed down even more now as I approach 2mgs, as it really does seem to be better for me. My body hardly notices what I'm up to and I like the feeling of control. I never was a patient person, but if PMR has taught me anything, then its patience :o I do hope you don't mind me sharing this. I just feel very elated after a really stressful week when it was all bad news. Take care.

"Whilst we've been talking about the AA question and mixing up effects and side-effects someone asked about omeprazole (was it you MrsO?).
A speedy google came up very quickly with a list of side-effects and other info from the FDA (the US Federal Drugs Agency) who may not be perfect but are generally truthful.
Omeprazole has listed amongst its side-effects (there are others):
general feeling of being unwell
difficulty sleeping
blurred vision
sweating
confusion
muscle weakness
muscle pain / tenderness
leg cramps
water retention
There is also a warning about longterm use increasing the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures of the wrist and thigh (and somewhere else). They say it should not be used for more than 2 weeks at a time and intermittent use over more than a few months is discouraged.
The last 4 side-effects I've listed are less common and there are other PPIs where they say these side-effects rarely occur - but they can occur.
I'm not saying they shouldn't be used for us - but again, if you look at that list of side-effects - how are you supposed to know if it is the PMR, the steroids or the omeprazole. Has its use been looked at in PMR and similar diseases? And those of you who are on it - for how long have you been taking it? I'm not saying you shouldn't be taking it - I'm very interested to know though.
Whilst I've been reading this last week I did see a comment in a paper that adverse events are known to be grossly under-reported and dismissed by doctors if they are mentioned (I did suggest that). That came up in connection with the fact that my blood tests show a slightly raised cholesterol and I was doing my homework to back up my refusal to take statins! I have found papers that say that, whilst they do have an effect in men, there is no evidence that giving women statins for a slightly raised cholesterol has any effect on their 10 year risk of having a cardiac event or stroke and saying that there should be different recommendations for men and women - and the main review was published in the Lancet in 2006/7. But they are still pushing statins at us like there's no tomorrow. I shall be reading some more! :roll: :wink: One thing I do know is that it has been shown that statins can be causing muscle damage without there being any blood test evidence but if you complain of muscle pain with statins most docs will only look at the enzyme that is supposed to show if there is muscle damage and if it's normal will say no, it's not that.
But think about it - if you have PMR and are on steroids, omeprazole, statins and whatever else, how do you know where you are?!! Our poor bodies - because I'll lay odds no-one has looked at how they all interact.
More to think about - poor steroid brains!
Trying to snow here again - after a beautiful day yesterday! We get a few days of winter then a few days of spring, rinse and repeat! Confuses the PMR too! :lol:
However - further south in Italy there are horrendous floods after 8 in of rain in places,

"Hi all...am starting this under a new thread to see if anyone can offer an explanation :?:
This morning when I put in my contact lenses, my right eye seemed blurred....thought I hadn't it in properly or had put the wrong lens in the wrong eye or some such daft thing, but all was in order :roll: .
As I was about to head to a friends father's funeral, I decided to give it a while to see if it would clear. Driving home, I realized that I could not read the reg on the car in front if I closed my left eye, so I headed straight to my optician as was worried it might be GCA developing :cry:
Now.....here is the REALLY bizarre thing. After examing my eyes and trying another lens, just in case I had a faulty one, the optician was about to despatch me to A&E and said I should take out the lens before going. I removed it....and could see perfectly :lol: Did the whole eye chart thing again, and much to both our surprizes my right eye is now a plus point 5 prescription ie long-sighted, whereas up until this morning I was minus 2.25
My optician has no idea why or how this has happened, or whether it will be permanent as she has never seen this scenario before. I have left a message with my rheumy to update him and see what he thinks as I have no idea if it is linked to the PMR, the steroids or something else...all very strange though :? . I have tried googling sudden changes in vision, but it is all about getting worse rather than better.
So over to all of you...have any of you experienced any sudden changes in vision?
Love to all, Pauline

"Hi all.
When I first started taking Prednisolone back in November, I was told that I would most probably gain some weight. So I was ready for this, and to be honest I would rather have the weight gain than the pain.
I have a slim frame anyway, and as I continued to take it, I didn't really notice any weight gain..that is until now. I seem to be developing a pronounced 'muffin top' around my middle.
The thing is, I feel so good in myself on the steroids, and my appetite is really good..As the title says, most of the time, 'I could eat a horse'!
It seems that I will obviously have to try and address my eating habits. But what do you do when your stomach is rumbling and asking for food most of the time??
Are there many of you out there who have the same huge appetite while taking Prednisolone? Or doesn't it affect you?

"This morning I felt my usual, some sore muscles, but as the day wore on I felt up to washing the windows. My wife is having about 11 of her girl friends over this Friday for her turn in hosting their monthly get-together for \""Bunco\"" — which is a dice game requiring little skill, but a fun time and social event. I'll probably go to a movie to get out of the house. We have a pretty good-sized house, 4 BR, 2 BA, family room, so there are 16 windows. I hate to admit how long it's been since I washed our windows last. I'm probably going to pay for this tomorrow with very sore muscles, but it really needed to be done. When I finished and was washing up, I remembered that today is my first day to reduce my Pred to only 8mg instead of 9mg. Hmm? Maybe I better delay the first day of reducing. :roll:

"Hi everyone,
I've just returned from Rheumatology clinic, and saw the great man himself this time. He is doubting that this is PMR that I have, because, a) I didn't react quickly to steroids in the beginning, it was weeks rather than days, b) I've had hardly any shoulder/neck/arm pain, a little in the beginning, but none at all now for months, it's all leg pain, and c) he said I was a little young at 67 for PMR----what a hoot!!! there are lots of people post on here who are much younger than I. I think he was having a \""senior moment\"" when he said that, although he was far too young!! He thinks it could be viral. He said he's seen a few people recently who have presented similar to me, not quite right for PMR. The doctor I saw last time was more sure it was PMR. However whatever it is , I carry on reducing the preds, I'm on 9mg now and told to drop 1/2 mg a day for 2 weeks at a time until reaching 7, then stay on 7 for 4 weeks, then continue 1/2 mg at a time until I return to clinic in 3 months time. Wouldn't it be good to have a definite diagnosis?!!!
Hope you're all having a good day,
Molly.

"Hello everyone and I hope you don't mind me asking this non-PMR question. Just wondering if any of my PMR friends looking in has ever suffered from swollen glands and sore throat whilst on Prednisolone which have failed to respond to antibiotics?
After seeing two doctors :doctor: (one of whom amazingly visited me at home!), taking a course of Erithromycin (just finished today) and having a swab taken on Friday (results awaited), the only diagnosis I have so far is tonsillitis (had my tonsils removed when I was 5!! :? ). The Dr mentioned that none of my records show such a severe sore throat in the past. I have never previously suffered from swollen glands - they are hard like a couple of golf balls. I am now two weeks into whatever illness this is which started with an inflamed feeling across the very top of the stomach and nausea and blocked nasal passages making breathing difficult (no diarrhoea or actual sickness) - thankfully these symptoms have now resolved.
Apart from the Erithromycin, I have gargled with Paracetamol and salt water, and inhaled steam. I have had to stop all hot fruit drinks such as lemon, orange and Ribena due to a load of mouth ulcers. I have been taking spoonfuls of Manuka honey but still the sore throat and the 'golf balls' remain.
So sorry if I sound an absolute misery - am trying not to be but having been stuck in the house for almost two weeks and having missed out on a few pre-Christmas festivities already am finding it hard to get myself into the Christmas spirit. :cry:
The Dr referred to the steroids weakening the immune system to the extent of it not being able to fight the infection but the last throat infection 2 years ago responded well to Erithromycin and I have been so lucky since then not to even suffer a sniffle. I was on a higher dose 2 years ago so wonder whether that gave more protection than the 1mg dose I am on at present. So many questions, so few answers.

"Hi to Everyone.
Just spent an hour reading all the messages posted since I went to Spain :yikes: Sad to see some new friends have arrived, pleased to see the good news posts and sorry to note that some are still struggling. We've just enjoyed the best February Spanish weather I can remember (first started living/holidaying there in 1984 8) ) and I have to say that winter sunshine should be mandatory for all those suffering from PMR. I wish I had a large home in Spain and could invite everyone over for regular vitamin D top ups. No aches or pains at all while I was away and decided to drop from 3.5 to 3mgs for a couple of days a week with no hassle. It was good to see the daffodils making an effort when we got back, so hopefully spring is just around the corner. :rose: (where's the daff? Really must try and add a few more emoticons to this site!!) Just wanted to say hello to everyone and look forward to my daily dose of PMR blog. Take care everyone.

Today, I received a letter from my GP and Consultant.
Luckily I live in Gateshead and Gateshead Pharmaceutical Group have recently agreed for Primary Care to prescribe Dekristol (pure Vitamin D).
The recommended dose for me, is 20000 units twice daily for 10 days.
I cannot wait to start it as this musculskeletal aching is really getting me down. I have had quite a few 'ten ton trucks clobber me' but this time the constant aching in every muscle and bone has really got me down to rock bottom. I thought the back pain was bad, but at least the brandy helped that - nothing has helped this time.
I now think that I have a vague idea as to what PMR patients have to put up with. I am full of admiration for you all.
I will keep you posted as to how I progress. 'The only way is up'.

"New to the list, & started feeling unwell last July, achy ,tiredness, tearful, not my usual self.Thought it was my under active thyroid, saw doc, took bloods, came back nothing, just E.S.R. slightly raised.
Went back & forth for sometime,as things got worse,finally he said he was 80%sure it was P.M.R.put me on 15mg Prednisolone, then things started to go really weird, woke up twice with rapid heart beat & breathing fast, hubby called ambulance, had e.c.g s nothing , scans nothing , doc said thought my heart was an innocent bystander.
Anyway next time I was rushed in they said panic attack, I am not a panicky person , but try telling them that !
Doc at hospital did say he thought the steroids were not high enough , so put me on 20mg, then had pain in my back near shoulder, doc thought clot on lung, had scans nothing, by now I am almost on my knees, & feeling so ill.dragging myself out of bed to sit on a chair.So weak. Doc there said \""no not P.M.R\"" & stopped the steroids.
Paid to see Rhuematologist, had been having headaches , blurred vision ,& loss of vision in one eye for a few seconds , though seemed ages.he said as my E.S.R. wasnt that high [38] it wasnt P.M.R & didnt pick up on G.C.A either, he referred me to a nuerologist for an M.R.I. scan. again nothing, but this time he said P.M.R. & Temporal Arteritis, AT LAST someone is listening to me!!
He put me on 50mg steroids for 1 week dropping every week to 30, after dropping to 40 it all came back, so doc put me on 50mg again this time for 4 weeks,then dropping to 45, then 40 till I see him again this week.
You wonderful people have given me hope , I have read your letters , & feel there is a light at the end of the dark tunnel, Thank you so much.
I still feel very weak& some days cry , no leg pains now since I took Devils Claw, after 3 days the pain went, I read it does help P.M.R. sufferers.
I have had slight ache in my head , not exactly a full blown headache, but I am hoping its not the Temporal arteritis back again, will know more tomorrow after seeing the doc.
Hope I have rambled on too much , apologies if I have.Just needed to talk to somebody who knows what its like.Thank you

"Hello girls ( and gentlemen!)
Have just gotten back from seeing my doc who is very concerned about what has been going on over the past four weeks.
She has put me up to 20mg and is re-referring me urgently to the hospital as she wants me to have further scans etc as she is concerned that something might have been overlooked.
She has also asked me to have a blood test to ascertain my 'levels' ( cannot remember what they are called at the moment) even though the past two have shown no significant rise in markers.
She will also see me in three weeks time.
She agreed that the drop from 15 to 10 was far too precipitous and that this has given rise to the problems I have been having..... BUT the 15mg are now not controlling the pain....
Didn't mean to but wept throughout the consultation.... she was lovely.... have known her a long time and she did say that I must be in severe pain to even contemplate taking steroids let alone an increased dose!
I am one of those people who have to be absolutely desperate to take anything so she actually voiced this and said she knew absolutely how dire the pain must be to see me weeping and agreeing to take 20mg :cry:
Fingers crossed hospital will see me sooner rather than later...... last year my urgent referral at the end of June resulted in me seeing the consultant at the beginning of October :roll: :roll:

"Hi all,
Some very simple questions for all you 'wise owls'.
I am due to see my doctor tomorro. I am currently back on 15mg of Pred, after experiencing bad leg pain when he (quite wrongly, as I have sinced learned from this forum) dropped me from 15mg to 10mg.
I have been back on 15mg for about a month now, and although things have improved, its all seemed to have come to a halt.
To be honest I am expecting the doctor to drop my dose again when I see him, as getting me off the preds as soon as poss seems to be his goal.
I feel a lot better on 15mg, but I am not free of pain completely, as I still get a some niggly pain every morning on getting out of bed, and last thing at night before going to bed. I find it is better some days than others.
Question is: As I am still getting a degree of pain, is it better that I stay on 15mg and wait (and hope and pray) for the pain to go in its own time?
Or, as I am not seeming to continue to improve, should my dose be put up even higher to blast this leg pain away completely?
Maybe my dosage should not be dropped at all at this time? I am of course a bit wary of doing this as I don't want the pain to come back even worse as it did last time.
I know you are not doctors but your opinions would be appreciated.

"Someone in one of the threads was asking about this - I have used one for years, it was my lifeline when I was working and didn't want to take painkillers - I was fogged enough with the steroids and concentrating took some concentration, if you see what I mean.
It worked well for me - I used it mainly on neck and shoulders where I could locate a trigger point to zap. They are not of much use for generalised aches and pains.
I don't use mine as much now that I am not working, just once or twice when I've been out, but for those years I wouldn't have been without it.
The only thing I have against it is that you can't really use it on your head, which in fact is where I would like the relief most. Scalp and head pain has always been my main moan and still is, but now it doesn't matter if I go wandering about not knowing which day it is. I take both co-codamol and Tramadol for pain, the cocos work on the muscle pain and the Tramadol on the nerve pain I now get (that's a different story).
I find that just lately I have popped in here for a read more and more - just to see what Granny Moss is getting up to! Dear Granny Moss, I hope I am hoping to be the recipient of 'indecent proposals' in 20 years time!
Mrs O, you still sound under the weather with your glands - hope the hospital can give you some help.

"Hello everyone
There is a letter posted in the Good Health pages of today's Daily Mail from an 88 year old lady in Somerset who was diagnosed with PMR 10 months ago and prescribed 15mgs of steroids. She is complaining of not feeling any better, is suffering from numerous symptoms and has already lost the sight in one eye but her GP has declined her request to see a rheumatologist!!!
Top GP Dr Martin Scurr has replied to her letter saying that it is crucial that she has the distinction made between PMR and or GCA owing to the threat of losing sight in her good eye, adding that 40-60mgs daily of steroid would be need in the case of GCA. He suggested that a rheumatologist is the right person to see, failing which she should see an eye specialist asap who he states will \""react to her question with vigour\"".
Just thought some of you may be interested in either getting the newspaper or looking it up online as it is a very concise and comprehensive reply from Dr Scurr - oh that all GPs could be like him!

"I was able to convince my internist (GP) to allow me to stop taking the statin for cholesterol (Lipitor). I had been on half the normal dose (1/2 of 20mg daily) for the past three months. He tried to talk me into taking half of the 20 mg (or 10 mg) every-other day, but I said I'd like to try stopping it altogether since my blood tests were okay. He said ok. (My cholesterol two weeks ago was pretty good at 185 with my good cholesterol (HDL) at 52. I told him I would continue to exercise and watch my diet in attempts to keep my cholesterol level in the good range. Just being off the statin these past three weeks has helped with the muscle pain in the tricep area of my arms. I had described this new pain to my Rheumy and he ordered a CPK or CK blood test to see if the statin could be causing this. That test was negative, but he said that that test is not always accurate and the statin could still be causing this.
This last Sunday (Jan. 23rd) I started on the lower dose of 9 mg each day (down from 10). The alternate day of 10 then 7.5 didn't seem to work for me, so my Rheumy wrote a script for some 1mg tablets. So I'm taking 5mg in the AM, then 4mg after dinner. Hopefully this reduction will go more smoothly. So far so good, but the mornings are the worst. It gets better as the day goes on like expected.
I can see now why someone on this forum got the 5 mgs and 1 mgs mixed up. They are the exact same color and shape, but the 1mg tablets are maybe 20% smaller.

Running barefoot on soft green grass,
chasing the butterflies

Red poppies, daisies and cornflowers,
would make a picture frame

The trees, such easy climb,

The sky was always blue,

And when caught, we'll put it

As there is so much knowledge on this site I thought I would ask this question which has been niggling at me a little bit.
As I have said in other posts, I was diagnosed with PMR in mid November after approx 12 months of varying degrees of pain.
Back in mid October I had a nasty attack of Labyrinthitis (inner ear inbalance) whilst I was at work.
I felt as sick as a dog and the room was swimming, but I managed with a struggle to get home and I was off sick and very poorly for about 3 weeks with much dizziness and nausea. I could hardly get out of bed I felt so ill. You can imagine what it was like with the (yet undiagnosed) PMR pain as well.
I am just about over it now, but still have very slight dizziness if I do any sudden movements or walk too fast.
I am wondering if this attack of Labyrinthitis could be linked in any way to my PMR?
Are there any other illnesses that are linked with PMR?
gilly.

"So many of our group seem to be feeling down and poorly at the moment that I'm wondering if this is the right time or the wrong time to inject a bit of good news.
This time last year I'd been diagnosed for 4 months, I was on 15mgs Prednisolone and feeling awful. I'd missed Christmas completely (where did that go I asked myself). Was cancelling lunch and supper dates, gave up the gym, stopped the swimming. I felt exhausted all the time. I even had to stop going to Spanish classes because the 'treacle brain' simply wasn't functioning in English let alone in a foreign language! I just wanted to stay indoors and make it all go away.
This time this year (I know it doesn't make sense, but you know what I mean!). I'm down to 4mgs Pred, I'm entertaining again (albeit a little less fussy with the food) I've taken up walking instead of the gym (much cheaper) I'm back at Spanish and actually grasped the past tense last week. I enjoyed the company of friends on Thursday and Friday, went to see The King's Speech on Saturday and took my lovely daughter to the O2 Arena on Sunday as a very belated 40th birthday present.
I do hope this comes across as encouragement (which is what I badly needed a year ago) and not boasting. I just feel so sad when I hear how frustrated and poorly people are feeling just now and want you to know that there is light at the end of that rotten tunnel and that you will soon start to feel better. Now, do I press submit or not?
Much love to all

"Well, the other one was getting too long.
Just back from visting Hospital - got there after a phonecall on Friday saying no time to write, can you get here 10.30am Tuesday to see Phsysio plus A N Other at the big hospital, physio is done at a smaller one which concentrates on physio, rehabilitation and pain management.
Absolutely brilliant - two people - one the Head Physio and t'other a Pharmacist. Why here and not small one. Ah we need a skilled hospital pharmacist at this consultation.
Went through the lot, medication for past four years, both prescribed and bought otc. Big laughs. The physio examination - result 'are you sure you are 73 this April'. Hips OK, Knees OK, strength OK. Arteries OK - everything OK. Bone density still OK.
Outcome, as leg pain has gone away for the second time - they decided I was getting to see them too late. So now have telephone number to ring them direct if it occurs again - they will see me within 24 hours of that call, if not sooner.
Discussed Vit D level with Pharmacist - he is going to check it out for me.
We all hope that this second episode is the last one, if not, help is at hand.
I cannot, just cannot fault the NHS treatment I personally have received this past 4 years.
If the current government messes it up when the improvements over the past 10 years are just beginning to come on stream I will be so sad.
Oh and guess what, neither of them have hit 30 yet and they treat me as one of themselves and not as an 'old fuddy duddy'
Absolutely fabulous.

"I have started a new thread which takes over from fiftiesgirl question on the mrsk and Admin thread.

I do not want to push the DVD that PMR&GCA UK North East Support made, but it was made with specific aims:-
a) no jargon
b) medically correct
c) patients as well as Medics
d) target audience - the person with PMR and family and friends to help then understand what is was that was happening to you, the person with PMR and/or GCA.
We all went through a pretty dreadful time when first diagnosed, as most of us had not heard of either PMR or GCA, we left, after a 15 minute consultation and diagnosis and were bewildered. And then discovering there was no known cause or cure was a big blow.
Without this site, Kate, Pam, Jayne, Wendy and Mavis would never have got together and then met other like minded people and eventually helped set up a new National Charity and then Pam, Mavis and Margaret went on to set up a registered Charity in the North East of England.
Without Awards for All and Gateshead MBC and the medical profession located in the North East we would never have been able to produce the DVD.
We would like to issue it free to everybody outside the North East but we have to charge for postage and packaging - money as usual is problematic.
People who have paid the p&p have commented on it and those comments are on the website. To date there have been no adverse comments.
It might just help you to help hubby understand.
Other people on this site have obtained the DVD and they might like to add their sixpennorth.

"Hello everyone, I have just been diagnosed with PMR after 18 months of feeling pretty awful. I was misdiagnosed at first with M.E./C.F.S but my GP was not happy with this diagnosis (bless her) so she referred me to a Rheumy who diagnosed me with PMR (in spite of the fact that my ESR is normal) I was in a pretty poor state when he saw me, restricted movements in my shoulders and hips meant I had real trouble dressing and doing normal things. The diagnosis was confirmed when the IV 120mg steroid injection he gave me produced dramatic effects and I am feeling a lot better now and am being prescribed 20mg Pred for the next 6 weeks and then to taper etc.
I did have an episode of jaw pain when I was eating that lasted about a week and then eased, so I am wondering if I could have or be starting GCA. My GP told me to tell her if it returns.
I also have some other symptoms and I was just wondering if they could be connected. At the start of all this I got a really itchy scalp, I have very weak neck muscles and sometimes find it a struggle to hold my head up for long periods without resting it on a cushion and I also have some trouble swallowing and quite a hoarse voice. My GP has given me some antacid medication as she suspects acid reflux, perhaps due to all the NSAIs I was taking. My arms and legs are also quite weak - will that improve as the treatment continues - I have only been diagnosed a week. Do any of these symptoms ring bells?
I am on a phased return to work at the moment - I am a teacher and have been off work since mid November. I went back for my first day on Friday and by the end of the day I felt pretty exhausted and the pains were back in my shoulders. How long do you think it will take me to be up to a full time return? I am back in two days next week and I am really hoping I can go to four days the following week. Has anyone had experience of working with this in the early stages of treatment?
It has been such a comfort reading all your stories and knowing that I am not alone in all this.

"I'm reducing from 5mgs to 4mgs (two more weeks to get to 4!) and on Sunday I was standing in the kitchen minding my own business when I suddenly had a bout of palpatations :yikes: I've had these before but not for many years and these almost knocked me off my feet. They lasted all afternoon, all evening, all night and most of the next morning but got quieter and quieter as time went on. I have half a cup of coffee with my breakfast and that's it for the day, I don't drink tea, I'm not anxious and I don't have a heart problem (big check-up last year) so I'm wondering if the pred reduction could have anything to do with it. Has anyone else had palpatations whilst reducing at the lower levels? Could it be a withdrawal symptom? If it is then its the first one I've noticed. I decided (in my igonorance :? ) that maybe my adrenal glands were starting up again and it was a rush of adrenaline but I think that's just wishful thinking! Hope everyone is keep well.

I seem to have repeated the same pattern again this year, without the blip, thank goodness, but have never got below 7.0 mg.

To cut a long story short, he finally diagosed PMR when my MRI returned as normal. Within three days of starting 15mg of prednisolone was painfree! A miracle.
I then began researching what this PMR was and was shocked. I am only 59 and have been very healthy to date. ( Apart from oral Lichen Planus for the past 16 tears!)
My physio has given me a programme of exercises and rest, swimming and generally working slowly to get muscles back to where they were at some point in the past.
Have to take, like rest of you, Vit D once a week and other six days calcium. Trying to get myself into a routine with that!
Had to drop my 15mg to 10mg a week ago ( following consultants instructions) and after 24 hours all the horrible pain etc was returning much to my horror. Saw my doc today ( who is now going to manage me!) and she put it up to 13mg telling me the 5mg drop was too great.

"This lady has posted on another website located in Canada for sometime.
Over the holidays she posted this - needless to say I have answered it and got her permission to post it here.
[i:0a13e242de]Hi, I am in Australia and have had PMR for 5yrs. Have twice got down to 2 mg, but that was as far as it went. Always something happens and I have to up it.
Should I complain about the cold in winter in Sydney????? I do not think so.... BUT this winter was cold for us. I got a cold and needed antibiotics and just did not recover. Pred up to 5mg and then 7mg to get me 'back on the road'.
Last week I turned 60, and for me over the 5 yrs I have tried to do with as little Pred as possible, and rest and look after myself, but that does not get me better and that is not my lifestyle to sit back and watch life go by.
I now take 6mg, which allows me to walk my Dalmation twice a day and walk hills and play with my grandchildren and swim and care for my mum and dad etc....
I still get some fatigue, but, for me , if I can stay around this and then taper ever so slowly without losing the lifestyle, then that is me.
Pmr did not go away for me by taking care and standing on the side lines.
Sorry everyone but this is me and turning 60 was a shock , I want to be able to do so much more and this damn PMR is not going to stop me if I only need a this amount of pred and my bones, kidneys and BP are OK.
I had a lovely Christmas and I so wish everyone a wonderful Christmas and New Year.
I also wish you all the energy to fight PMR, and you can feel better if you take the damn Prednisone, and have a Dr and yourself watch out for side effects.
Those with many other diseases do not have the ability to have a drug help them to participate in life.

"Hi everyone,
I've been back to my GP this morning for blood results, all good, thyroid normal, been taking medication in increased doses for almost 1yr. full blood count was normal, and ESR was 9. So far so good, but he tried very hard to talk me into taking Alendronic acid, which up to now I've refused to take, because of the possible horrendous side effects. He's organizing a DEXA scan, but says even if it comes back normal, I should take the Alendronic acid, to prevent possible future bone problems as I'm likely to be taking Pred for some time. My rheumatologist said that with my diet (she asked how much milk, yoghurt etc I consumed) I shouldn't need a bone protector. I'm taking Calceous twice daily, which is calcium and vitamin D. Which way do you jump when there are two conflicting opinions. I want to do the best thing for myself but am quite confused!!
A very happy not so new year to you all. May we all have a fairly pain-free year. Cheers, Molly.

"Hi all friends on this board!
In the middle of December I had been two years off pred. We have just moved to another home and have downsized. I was a bit afraid that the stress of moving and getting rid of old dear things (that we had to) would put me back on pred. But I made it!
As I have succeeded to get off pred, I want to repeat what especially mrs K writes. It is not pred that is the enemy - it is pmr. Pred helps us to stand the pain even if it doesn´t cure us. I am glad that pred helped me to get back to an almost normal life. I am 73 now, so sometimes it is hard to know what depends on age and what depends on other things.One reason I managed to get off pred was the method I used, and I am proud that on some boards they call it Ragnar´s method - to slowly go over to a lower dosage.
I hope that you all get better in 2011. I know there is a light at the end of the tunnel as I have seen it myself. Too bad with the cold weather all over Europe, though.
Happy New Year

"Hi, I'm a 51 year old woman from Australia who was diagnosed with PMR 2 months ago. It literally came on overnight. I woke up one morning very stiff and sore and had trouble getting down the stairs because it seemed my inner thighs had seized up. I was also having a lot of pain across the shoulders which no amount of professional massage could fix.
Luckily it was only 6 weeks before I took myself off to my GP. He started me on 20mg of Prednisone and within 6 hours I could get up from a chair without hobbling like an old (110 year old) woman!
MY GP asked me to reduce to 15mg after a week which brought back most of the pain. I found this amazing site and decided to take matters into my own hands. I went back up to 20mg, and have slowly reduced to 16mg with some shoulder pain but I'm getting used to a bit of pain in the first few days after reducing.
I also have Fibromyalgia and a couple of other auto-immune issues.
I take great comfort from everyone's posts. If you guys can live happily with PMR then so can I!

"Hi Everyone, It`s been ages since I visited the site. Been too wrapped up in worrying about my son (terminal liver cancer) and my husband who`s just had palliative radiotherapy for his prostate cancer.
I think in my last post I was complaining of itching all over- well I still am - since July. After seeing a neurologist and having an injection in the occipital nerve, I decided that since he didn`t think my PMR was complicated by temporal arteritis I`d take a chance and come off the steroids in case they were causing the itch. Well I can`t say I`m without pain but it`s manageable.
Saw a Dermatologist privately who asked no questions, looked at my waistline, drew the blunt end of a biro across it and wrote me out a prescription for tabs. I was in for less than 3 minutes. Saw him again after 5 weeks-no improvement- double up the tabs and see him in 6 weeks! Apart from the fact that it`s over an hour`s drive to him and the cost of the consultations- he has no interest in finding the cause.
So I`m off to a homeopath next !! Hope you are all improving, Shebob X

She came out within half an hour (bless her) and found that my blood pressure had dropped dramatically (the reason for passing out) and as I just could not stop being sick she gave me a jab in the bum (am I allowed to say that here :lol: ). She gave me the glad tidings that it would possibly make the PMR flare up as I was very poorly. No point worrying about that, just wondering whether I should up the prednisolone for a few days or leave it be and see how it goes. Anyone had a similar experience? My reduction has been going so well I don't really want to tamper with it, however, lots going on just now with Christmas round the corner and thinking maybe just stop reducing for the time being rather than up the dose. Any ideas. Of course there is always a silver lining and this one is? The loss of 8lb in weight - almost overnight! I feel like a teddy bear that's had its stuffing taken out!

"Good morning.
I’m new to this forum although had quick look at some of the postings over the past couple of weeks. I m 55 and diagnosed with PMR early October following six weeks of pain and stiffness, thought it was due to gardening originally and went to the osteopath who made no difference whatsoever !
I have a very busy life, work full time in a demanding job and just coming to the end of a very difficult year, both my parents have died suddenly this year, my youngest son has emigrated to Australia and I have had two significant job changes . I am interested what people think about if PMR is stress related? I have gone through the year coping with everything life has thrown at me and not taken any time off work. My GP thinks it is not related - but I just wonder......
My GP is supportive and diagnosed me very quickly when I eventually went to see her – she has contacted me with phone appointments and is very supportive in managing this with me. I started on 15mg of prednisolone for 4 weeks, then to 12.5 for 4 weeks and about to go down to 10mg this weekend with a view to keeping me on the 10mg until the end of February as we are going to Australia for the whole of Feb and we don’t want to be messing with my body then. My next question is can someone suggest some guidance in going from 12.5 to 10 over a number of days?
My third and final question is about the lovely calcium tablets I take daily – I’m sure when I was first reading on the forum I found some discussion about not taking the calcium tablets at the same time of day as the prednisolone as it affects the absorption. Is this the case or is it something I have made up?
Sorry another question – why am I wide awake at 4am every morning – is the time I take the medication related to when I wake up – I presently take my steroids at around 7.15am (after eating), I’m finding the lack of sleep problem – brain starts ticking over and feel I’m going round in circles.
As you might guess I’m just at the stage where I want to take control of this and keep myself as well as possible. Any advice and information will be gratefully received.

"Hello everyone!
I'm new to this site, although I have been reading all posts since more than a year. The reason why I haven't posted before is that I live in Sweden, my English is not perfect, and thought maybe I shouldn't intrude in your virtual PMR-family just like that.... We also have a PMR forum in Sweden, but it is very inactive, that's why I am tempted to join yours! You seem to have so much experience and have always some good advice to give!
A short presentation about me:
I'm a 59 year old woman, born in Hungary, living in Sweden since 31 years, married to a Swede. Since 7 years we spend the Winters (Oct-Apr) in Spain and so it is this time too: staying at a campsite with a big motor home which gives us all comfort we need.
I have had PMR since May 2008 and been on Prednisone since Nov-08. Started at 20 mg and now approaching 3,1 mg. Since I was on 5mg, I use a very slooooow tapering method, allowing me 5-6 weeks to reduce from e.g. 3,75 to 3,1 as I do now. The reason to this slow tapering is a few ups-and downs earlier this year, when I needed to up the dose a couple of times. Since then I decided to have much more patience...
Luckily, it all goes very well now, I have no pain at all and should be really happy for that, BUT.... there are other problems:
Since end October I have had a persistent virus infection (as the Spanish doctor calls it), which gives me unpleasant symptoms. It all started with some light irritation in the throat with some kind of a reflex of cough. I don't cough much at all, it's mainly the never ending reflex. Haven't had any temperature, and haven't felt ill in some way during this period.
Have seen a doctor here a couple of times, he did some blood tests which were OK, and he says it's a virus infection - not a bacterial one (how does he know that?), thus no need for antibiotics. Have also had a night with a terrible diarrhoea - which, according to the doctor, were caused by the same virus... If this weren't enough, the latest weeks I also feel a bit dizziness (not much, but it gives me an unstable feeling when walking or standing). Visited the same doctor for the 3rd time, and he gave me medicine for the dizziness (which \""of course\"" is also caused by that virus!). This medicine, called Beta Serc, doesn't make any big difference, so now I really don't know what to do.
Have any of you experienced such a prolonged problem with a virus? Do you think PMR could make it worse or rather make it more difficult to get rid of? Or is it the immune system which is so poor that it can't fight against that virus? I would really like to have some effective help, thought that antibiotics would be good, but as I understand, they have no effect on virus.....
Would appreciate very much if you could give me your comments on this. And apologize for this long thread, but I wanted to give you a picture about me in the beginning.
My kindest regards to all of you

I did a 15 hour trip to Luxor, walked miles in Petra in searing heat. I drank too much :redwine: and I ate too much :cake: . I snorkelled, I jumped off boats, I swam for hours. I even had a 2 hour bout of 'Gippy Tummy' and as suggested by the Doctor, just upped my Prednisolone by 1mg just for the one day. What a difference from this time last year when I went on a cruise and I could hardly walk. I remember hobbling to the breakfast buffet and having to hang on for dear life while I tried to persuade my shoulders to help me out with the coffee and toast. Do I think I've overdone it and will suffer later? Who knows, I had a fabulous time and will just keep my fingers crossed. Don't much like this weather by the way. Hope you're all keeping well and its good being back with my PMR friends.

"Good Afternoon to all you PMR-ers out there.
As some of you will know I am a long standing Polywotsit and a fairly new Giant Thingy. According to the records I have had PMR now for 11+ years (I think that makes it chronic) and next month will be the 9th anniversary of my original diagnosis. GCA was confirmed a year ago.
I have been on the bottle - er, I mean the Pred, for that time in varying dosages.
During the summer months I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia also and with severe tendonitis. The Fibro is being dealt with sufficiently well at the moment as I was prescribed a low dose of Amytriptyline to take at night. Just for the record I would like to say that this also seems to have helped the CGA possibly by relaxing the scalp muscles? Whatever, the neck and scalp pain I get has been considerably reduced since I started taking it in July.
According to the podiatrist I saw the tendonitis at least is secondary to the PMR.
A quick insert here to say that I have also been taking Methotrexate for a year now; due to long term side effects from the Pred it was agreed last year that I needed to stop taking it as soon as possible. (The saga of that journey is written elsewhere, but my ups and downs were nothing to do with PMR). The MTX has worked wonders, I am currently on 3.5 Pred and have just started a very slow reduction to 2.5. Incidentally, we know that I have another arthritic condition (I am showing varied symptoms) which has been labelled Polyarthritis for want of a better term. The MTX is obviously helping with this as it has not really worsened since diagnosis a year ago. (Ooh, does that make me a double Polywotsit?)
However, as regards the tendonitis, I have reached the end of my tether and would like to know if anyone has any ideas or has seen anything which might help. Painkillers obviously do help a lot generally , but I have one specific bother. The tendon most affected and inflamed is the Achilles tendon and it is very swollen and painful at the point of insertion at the back of my heels - yes, it's the same both feet.
All the shoes and boots I have tried have a stiff lining, seaming or other packing at the back of the heel. I have got a pair of very cheap boots which are soft, but they are also very flat, something I have been told NOT to wear (I did this morning. If I hadn't got out of the flat for an hour I would be sitting here rocking and dribbling).
So, has anyone got, seen or come across anyone else who has a pair of shoes with soft backs AND with at least a small heel? Or a pair of shoes where the back edge is higher than the point of insertion of the Achilles tendon?
Sorry to have taken so long to get to the point, but there are a couple of things in there which some of you might like to comment on!
Best wishes to all

"Hello all!
I was just wondering if anyone read the article in today's Mail On Sunday by Barbara Powell (Babs of Pan's People if you're all ancient enough like me to remember the dancing group on Top of the Pops!)?
This is a two page spread about Barbara's experience of PMR and if you are able to download it I'm sure you will find it very interesting.
Barbara has been down both the steroid and Methotrexate routes and has recently had a steroid injection which she has been told should cover her for the next 3 months or so. Amazingly, she also managed to climb Killimanjaro whilst on steroids! :wow:
There are also comments by Professor Dasgupta who refers to the research being carried out into other steroid-sparing meds and for a blood test to eventually confirm PMR. Professor Dasgupta is the President of PMRGCAUK and, in fact, I have just today sent off my Membership Application Form and subscription to join this national organisation which hopefully will one day come up with more effective diagnosis and treatment if not for us but at least for the generations that follow.
It's so good to see that PMR and GCA is finally getting more coverage in the Press which can only help our cause.
Hope you're all enjoying a good (pain-free) weekend!

"I have just been diagnosed with GCA and PMR after one year of agony. My GP told me to start with that I wasn't 25 anymore and what did I expect at my age! I have spent money on acupuncture and physio as I didn't know where to go next. I am a 56 year old woman who has always been active, until now. However I guess I am so glad that at last I have found out what it is. I just want to say that my heart goes out to all you other fellow sufferers and that what a lovely support group you seem to have going here.

"No, not THOSE benefits.
This may sound really odd but since I have returned to taking Pred. ( as of last April ) I swear that some of my reactions have speeded up. Although my leg muscles are not all that good, my hand/eye coordination seems to be enhanced and not just since having my new specs. Several times I have made timely \""saves\"" in the kitchen which have surprised me. Just wish I could have a game of tennis to really test them out.
Perhaps I'll challenge a five year old friend to a game fitting little shapes into holes against the clock. Have to wait until Christmas, though as it's her present.

I was completely devastated when the doctor said its PMR and had never heard of it. Now just a few weeks on and I now have a fat face and some times I feel a bit low. I think the worse thing is not knowing what will happen. I started off on 20mg. After 2 weeks went down to 15mg, then bact to 20 when pains came back. Now o my second shot at 15 but having a few twinges. I am also worried I may have GCA as I occasionly have aches in temples. I would love to have any comments or advice.

I noticed in a previous post - vitamin D - I think - that red wine and it's effects came up, interesting to note that the effects may be due to pred rather than the illness itself.
I am now way recommending the consumption of alcohol, but, the season is upon us and I though I would share my limited experience:
[b:d89ef15ceb]Wine[/b:d89ef15ceb] feel very stiff/achey the next day, especially red wine
[b:d89ef15ceb]Gin[/b:d89ef15ceb], I drink it with tonic water - moderate amounts seem not to have any ill effects

"Hello fellow PMR sufferers. I was diagnosed mid-september but had been having symptoms for at least 6 months prior to that. My ESR was 93 when my GP started me on 20mg. pred. and within 6 hours I was a new woman ! Lowering the dose from 20-17 was no problem , 17-16 produced a few aches but nothing terrible. On Tuesday I went down from 16-15 and I have 60% of the pain back plus sore eyes and feverish symptoms as before. Is this a normal reaction and does it mean that I have reduced too quickly and need to go back to 16 or shall I hang on in there and expect to level out in a few days ? Any comments would be gratefully received.

"Hello all
Have seen my Dr today and my blood results were good ESR4 CRP4 She had put me in for lots of tests as it was my 2 year review My bad cholestral was a bit high but my good Cholestral was exceptionally low ( I like to be good at something !!) My blood pressure was also better so no tablets for that So I bounced out of the Surgery
I am at present on 4 4 5 4 4 5 and just playing it by ear as I go lower I will slow down even more Its taking me about 6 weeks to go down I mg at present and ( fingers crossed ) feeling OK Unfortunately until you have tried to reduce too quickly you dont know !! I asked about Vit D and she said that she had heard of lack of Vit D causing Muscle ache but judging by my suntan ( Back from Valencia ) I spent plenty of time in the sun and she said at least 30mins a day was advisded I was hoping my holidays might come on prescription !! She is very happy for me to reduce at my own pace
Hoping this lovely weather continues The New Forest looks beautiful at present and I can certainly do without the snow and ice of last year

I am under my GP who diagnosed me and I have every faith in him although after what you have both said if things don't improve I may have to rethink.
I went back to see him today and although the blood test was greatly improved my symptoms do not exactly match. He is more concerned in treating the aches and pains and has increased the steroids to 25mg and signed me off work for another 3 weeks.
He said that he is confident I will get better and the worse case synario (haven't a clue how to spell it) would be I would stay on 5mg for the rest of my life but I will be back to normal mobility.
I am feeling very positive but as they say 'watch this space'.

We went out for a lovely dinner at a Hotel hosted by friends who were married on the Arcadia recently and it was a lively evening the champagne and wine really flowed and I didnt sleep well but put it down to the alcohol !!!!!
That was until I looked at my tablets this morning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I will obviously be careful in future but has anyone else done this before ?
I need Eileen really to tell me how this will affect me I am now a bit worried that if my body doesnt have 20mg today it will start to ache again ??
Very cross with myself as my reduction had been going well I had done an extra week at this level as had a busy week and trudging through the wind and rain with my horses this week hadnt been much fun
I think I will have to follow Lizzie Ellen and put my tablets in a weekly box

"Hoping the cold weather is bearable (if your in northern hemisphere)
I am wondering if my experience is normal:
diagnosed in May
started on 20mg predisolone
reduced to 15mg quite quickly
stayed \""stuck\"" on 14 for many weeks, any reduction was awful
had acupuncture, that seemed to give it a kick and was then able to, by 0.5 reductions, to get to 11.5 and managing to run about quarter or a mile, still dodgy in the morning but picked up in the afternoon
then, two weeks ago I missed one of my 5mg tablets, so instead of 11.5 I took 6.5 - I found the tablet on the worksurface next morning, I had woken at 4am in considerable pain, from then have been struggling, increasing until I feel comfortable-ish but am disheartened to be at 13 and still struggling
Also seem to have developed some new pains, feels like some residual aches, round bones, might even be bones.
Anyone had anything similar?

Well it looks as if this Disease is going to be with me for quite a while.
Whilst I have full confidence in my Primary GP, I am beginning to wonder if there is more to this disease than checks on ESR and CRP.
My last ESR was within normal limits, but my CRP was still high. So now I am into my 5th year of the Hamster Wheel of varying doses of Prednisone, (presently at 5mgms each morning ) and experiencing pain / pressure behind my eyes.
Some days are not too bad but other days are very difficult to manage. I try to carry on each day as it comes, and still do my Volunteer work.
My last visit to the GP revealed elevated B/P..........which to my mind is something to be expected due to swollen Arteries. This of course could lead to a host of other problems (but I do not wish to add more medication to my daily routine )
I wonder if anyone else read the article on Beetroot juice having the properties to lower Blood Pressure. If so please tell more. Would it interfere with the Steroids.....as we know just because something has the word \""Natural\"" as a label does not mean Safe.

He has not shown the rapid improvement you all mention and is still suffering badly in the mornings and is very sleepy until after lunch. He also is quite depressed poossibly from the steroids or maybe from 5 weeks in hospital with all manor of tests before being given steroids.

"Hi everyone I just joined up here yesterday.
I gave up smoking 4 weeks ago because I was getting a lot of pain in my legs and arms etc.
So I went to the Doctor on Monday. I burst in to tears and could not speak, she must have thought \""jeepers what have I got here\"" finally between sobs I was able to tell her all about my pain etc.
She took a blood test and asked me \""could I wait 24 hours so that she would know what to treat me with\"".
I came back to her on Tuesday and she had the paper work on her desk. She said I had Polymyalgia Rheumatica never having heard of this before it was a bit of a shock to me.
Reading all the paper work and the possible side effects of the pills was also a shock. All of this scared me as well. But pills it is.
But it is now Wed evening and the pain has reduced greatly I can even put my socks on ha ha. And I am still off the ciggies.
I personally feel that now that I know what is wrong with me and that there is something wrong with me I will cope with this and do all the right things. It could have been so much worse I could have had something that was much worse than Polymyalgia Rheumatica.
Should I be eating any special foods etc.I eat lots of fish
So I have sort of rested the last two days and this Friday I am returning to my swimming. I am only a slow swimmer but it is very relaxing in the water.
Very happy to find you all

I wrote before (under the name PatC) under another thread about my experience so far - and thank you for your responses. Like all new members of this forum, it is so great to know I am not alone!
I have now managed to see a Rheum Consultant who confirmed GCA and PMA and had recommended a gentler withdrawl regime from 20mg - 1mg every one or two weeks depending how I feel. He says I could be off steroids alogether in 2 to 3 years. I am very happy with this level of withdrawl as I have been on 20mg for nearly 2 months now but don't want to risk the seroius withdrawl symptons I had last time.
He has also recommended Azathioprine to help steroid reduction but I can only have it \""if my TPMT levels are satisfactory\"".
Has anyone had any else had experience of Azathioprine?

"Hi,
My Gp thinks I have polymyalgia, as my symptoms have been going on quite a few months, going worse and worse, till I only go out of the house to get to work (I drive There), I get up two hours before I leave the house, and have a hot shower to ease the stiffness, I wake every morning around 0400 with pain around my pelvis and top of my thighs, and I have to get out of bed using my elbows, which are now really sore as I use them for getting out of the car and settee. I can't empty the dishwasher or get things from low down in the fridge as my hips and back are so stiff, or walk up stairs, or walk far at all. Both my shoulder joints are sore and upper arms, my right one where I use my mouse everyday makes me cry. I have brusitis in both hips, swollen painfull knee, swollen painful calf, tendons are swollen in my hands. I have been seeing a Rhuematologist but they thought I had fybromyalgia and also spondoloarthropothy with tendidnitis.
But I wanted to make sure the symptoms were polymyalgia, forgot to say I am 57 years old, was previously very active cycling, golf and gym, but I also have a lot of other autoimmune conditions, underactive, thyroid, dibetes on insulin, addisons disease, asthma, celiacs disease., I also am anemic and very fatigued.
I take 10mgs of pred anyway for my addisons as i don't produce any cortisol, I should take 7.5mgs, but I havn't been able to manage on that and as the other 2.5mgs have been helping my arthritis till the past few months, they have been letting me take the extra.
My GP has started me on 30 mgs for two weeks to see if it helps, as on friday I could hardly walk and was also starting the symptoms of an addisons crisis where I need more steroid anyway.
I also have facet joint disease in my back, and a facet cyst which is pushing two discs out, so I have bulateral sciatica as well, they won't operate as they say I'm not fit.

"Hi,
I have just been diagnosed with PMR, or so my doctor thinks. After blood tests, and typical symptoms, I was put on 15mg predisolone and told there should be a dramatic improvement within a couple of days. After a week I was no better, so my doctor is now doubting the diagnosis. However after a second week there is a gradual improvement, less stiffness and less pain, which is great. Why it has taken more time to react on me I don't know. I'm seeing a rheumatologist in 4 weeks time, so may get more answers then. Has anyone else experienced a slow reaction?

My ESR was Ok but CRP had gone back up to 23 (had been down to 7 last bloods)so my rheumy feels that I need to consider taking Methotrexate as he does not want to increase the steroids again. He gave me an injection of steroid directly into the right shoulder joint as an interim measure, and it has helped a bit, but he would like me to try 14 again and if I can't tolerate the lower dose he feels that the Methotrexate is worth trying.
he explained all the side effects and the regular blood tests required, and quite frankly, I am a bit terrified of taking it :cry: .
Because I had so many problems with bruising, weight loss and sleep disruption with the steroids i am worried that I will get even worse problems on the methotrexate.
How many of you have taken it, and did it really help or would I be opening an entirely new can of worms???
All advice welcome & if anyone finds my old life....CAN I PLEASE HAVE IT BACK !!

"Hi all!
In the \""Pain on reduction\"" thread MrsK has posted a comment about how she has it on good authority that everyone over 60 should get the vit D level in their blood tested and then said I'd tell you why!! :oops: :lol: I'll do my best and I hope you won't find it too long-winded!
I'm sure many of you have heard at some point that you get all the vitamin D you need from your diet and from sun exposure - I've been told that by my doctor. This is one of the myths I will try to explain here together with why it is important to this group in particular.
It is well known in the scientific and medical communities that low levels of vitamin D are found in patients with auto-immune disease, especially multiple sclerosis and arthritises but it isn't known whether this is cause or effect - i.e. is the disease caused by the deficiency of the vitamin or is the lack due to the autoimmune disease or even has it nothing to do with it at all. Whichever it is, this must have had an effect on the assessment of what is called the \""normal range\"" acceptable for the amount of vit D in our blood. To get a figure for this normal range, blood samples are taken from many people, the level is measured in all of them and then they look at the range of measurements made and take a set of figures which excludes the very high and very low levels and call this the \""normal range\"". Common sense would suggest that if there are a lot of people who have low levels then whilst the range you get after doing this is representative of what is found in the general population, it does not mean that this is the best level for the body to function. The opposite is also true of course - if everybody is very unhealthy and has a high cholesterol level then the \""normal range\"" might be on the high side of what is good for you.
In Victorian times it was realised that the poor living conditions and diets led to the development of rickets - children did not get enough calcium in their diet nor did they get enough exposure to the sun. This combination led to poor bone structure and rickets. Diets were improved, including supplements, and children were encouraged to go out in the sun. Remember the cod liver oil? Before the 1950s, especially during the war, food had added calcium and vit D (in milk, flour and margarine) to make sure there was enough even in restricted diets. At some point there was a scandal when a baby milk company made a mistake and added too much and babies were made ill so the practice was stopped in Europe although it still continues in the USA.
Vitamin D can also be made in our skin by the action of sunlight on cholesterol. You will all remember that we spent a lot of time outside when we were younger and no-one ever told us to put sun-screen on, whatever time of day it was. We ate eggs for breakfast and tea, ate cakes made with flour, margarine, eggs and milk. We had plenty of calcium, cholesterol and sunlight.
In recent years we have been told we shouldn't eat cholesterol-containing foods, we shouldn't go out in the sun in the middle of the day and if we do go out we should use high-factor sun-screens or cover up. The effect of this has been that we no longer make much vitamin D in our skin - using a factor 8 sunscreen reduces the amount of vit D made by about 95%! In addition, the sun has to strike the skin at an angle closer to vertical than it ever really manages in the UK - if you live north of Turin in Italy the amount is less than optimum! Between April and September you get some if you go out with bare arms and face at midday - there is no chance from November to February.
And getting vit D from your diet? You must eat more than 8oz of oily fish at least 3 times a week to get anything like what you need. Other than that there is almost none in our diet in the UK as nothing is fortified - even then you would need 40 tablespoons of margarine or 40 eggs a day to get enough! Oily fish is realistically the only source - salmon, and preferably wild salmon, sardines or mackerel. Fresh tuna has some but much less and tinned has almost none.
And now I'm going to introduce a touchy subject - age! If you are 20 you will make a reasonable amount of vit D - providing you are out in the sun and your cholesterol is OK. But studies on young healthy residents in Boston USA showed that even they had quite low levels of vit D in their blood - low even by the old accepted levels for the normal range. As you get older, your manufacturing company in the skin gets tired and less efficient and by the time you are 70 your body is making a quarter of what it did at 20. Add to that the fact that most older people just don't go out and sunbathe in skimpy summer clothes and you can see that at our ages (PMR is usually found in the over 50s) we're just not producing sackloads of vit D.
You will still get the story from pharmacists and doctors that it is dangerous to take too much vit D as it is a fat soluble vitamin - I suspect they think that that means it is present in all fat, which I've just shown isn't true - and is stored in the fat in our bodies and isn't released if you have too much (on the other hand, if you take too much vitamin C you just pee it out!). Nevertheless, there have been many studies in recent years which suggest that the currently accepted normal levels are far too low and that it is not dangerous to ingest much larger amounts of vit D than we are doing at present. It has been shown that if you boost the vit D levels of the elderly in care homes you can improve their balance and reduce the number of falls they have - and also the number of fractures as a result. A whole range of studies have led to the conclusion that the current normal range of 20 to 45 (I won't bother you with the units) is too low and that at least 50 to 75 would be much better for us.
However - this normal range was established years ago and, as I have shown, there have been massive changes in llifestyle since then which must have had a massive impact on the amount of vit D we have in our bodies. The truth is that for a large part of the population, their vit D level is below even the bottom end of this scale which is accepted by many authorities to be far too low. It is accepted even in the UK that 20 is low and 10 is far too low.
Anyone who is put onto calcium supplements and alendronic acid should always have their blood calcium checked beforehand and this is usually done. This is because if you have a too high or a too low calcium it can make you very ill. If it is high you don't need supplemets - if it is low and you are to take alendronic acid that takes more calcium out of your blood and it might get too low. That must be sorted out first. Nowadays your doctor will usually check your vit D level too - but not always. Some people - like MrsK - have never been given calcium/vit D supplements (AdCal or Calcichew) others find they disagree with them and stop taking them. Or they are taking so many tablets they miss some out. If they have a good diet with dairy products it probably doesn't matter for the calcium - but what about the vit D?
The current recommendations for the over 50s are for a supplement of 400 IU in the UK but some experts believe that we really need to take in about 2500 to 3000 IU of vit D a day. The 2 AdCal tablets you take have a total of 800IU, plus there will be a bit from your diet (depending on how much salmon you can afford!) and in the summer a bit from the sun - difficult to see how you are getting enough, isn't it? Even after months of taking the supplements and living in northern Italy - not far north of Turin and I use almost no sunscreen and go out in the full sun every day in the summer - my blood level just scraped in at 20.
There is a problem in the UK in that high dose supplements are not approved for GP use - although your consultant can approve them. The problem is getting them to agree you need them. Another problem is that the NICE guidelines state that \""it is assumed that post-menopausal women have an adequate calcium intake AND THAT THEY ARE VIT D REPLETE\"". i.e. there is no need to measure their blood levels. I was nowhere near vitamin D replete at diagnosis and MrSK has also just had her vit D measured after demanding it because of muscle pain that she was sure was not PMR - and it was very low. OK - we are just two but how many more of us are in the same situation?
Although we can't get high dose vit D from our doctors - we can get it from Boots. We don't need more calcium but there is a good chance we need more vit D - given the figures I quoted earlier. There are reputable studies to show that lack of vit D is also associated with at least 12 cancers besides the autoimmune spectrum of diseases and there are a lot of mainstream doctors who are coming round to the idea that we need more vit D to live healthily - if I hadn't found evidence of that I wouldn't be writing this. I don't jump on every bandwagon claiming this or that is the cure-all - but in this case both the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic have published work in the field besides a lot of others.
I leave it to you to consider and if anyone has any questions about anything I've missed out or that isn't clear - ask me please. It was a lot but I think it is an important aspect of our PMR journey.
cheers all,
EileenH

"hi guys, i've just found this site and would appreciate any help and advice that you could give.
My mother was diagnosed with PMR last week after having the classic symptoms and having blood tests taken. She was put on a course of steroids and after a couple of days her pains were reduced dramatically. However, four days later and she woke up and was in real pain again. The pain eases off a few hours after taking the steroids.
I was just wondering if other people had similar experiences? Is it normal to still be having pain whilst taking the steroids? She takes three tablets in the morning. I have read that some people have found it beneficial to spread their tablets out throughout the day. Would this be advised? I would be very thankful of any help and advice on these matters.

"Hello everyone –
I have been reading – on various strands - about how different people have been experimenting with diet to try to control polymyalgia. I noted that Jill48 is trying a modified version of the G diet – I have no experience of this personally, though a relative with inoperable lung cancer opted to try it as an alternative to chemotherapy (and enlisted the help of many friends to help with the juicing) – sadly however it was unsuccessful – but her cancer was very advanced.
Anyway – I have been reading a book called ‘Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis’ by Dr G J – a fellow countryman of Jill48 (and an MS sufferer himself). I bought the book for a friend who has been diagnosed with MS. It obviously focuses on diet to control MS, which is another autoimmune condition and I felt that some of the suggestions I read could be equally useful to someone with Polymyalgia.
One chapter is on the role of fats and fatty acids in the diet. It says that fats form the building blocks of immune system chemicals. It suggests that a diet high in mono-unsaturated fat (as is found in olive oil) is neutral for the immune system whereas a diet high in omega 6 fatty acids (as found in sunflower oil and palm oil) promotes the inflammatory response whereas a diet high in omega 3 fatty acids (as found in fish oil, flax(linseed) oil and all oily fish) suppresses the inflammatory response. So – it is felt that increasing omega 3 foods and decreasing omega 6 foods will have a beneficial effect for people with autoimmune conditions. Olive oil – being neutral – is useful for salad dressings and general cooking purposes. It is also recommended that saturated fats are kept to a minimum (though this might apply more to MS in particular). Another chapter in the book gives details of how Vitamin D plays a part in regulating the immune system.
Anyway – I have decided to follow this advice and am now eating lots of oily fish and am using olive oil for cooking rather than sunflower oil etc.etc. I am hoping that as I reduce my steroid dose – maybe the Omega 3 foods might start to take over the role that the steroids play in controlling the condition by suppressing the immune system – it’s worth a try and I like fish!
There is loads more you can read in the book (all backed up by research references) but for a taste of it you could Google ‘Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis’ should you be interested.

"Hi,
At last, I've made it to 5mgs!! As regulars know I am on the slowest reduction known to man or beast :monster: (nearest emoticon to a beast I could find!) I reduce just 1mg over a period of seven weeks, but 5mgs feels like a bit of a milestone! Its still going OK, very few setbacks so far. Went for my flu jab today and was offered a pneumonia jab as well. I say yes to everything. In the last six months I've had: mammogram, cervical smear, bowel screening, kidney function etc. etc. Passed them all with flying colours. If it wasn't for the PMR I could almost call myself healthy :lol:. I just feel I'm so lucky compared to my Mum and Dad's generation. I inherited my Dad's high blood pressure and cholesterol. His went untreated and he died as a result. Mine's just a daily tablet, regular check-ups and carry on as normal. Hope everyone has a good weekend.

"Hello to all,
I had an experience over the last couple of weeks which might be of use for people who are at the stage of tapering off prednisone.
After ten weeks of no caffeine at all, I had a cappucino. That was at 11 in the morning. I’d been up since 3 am but flew though the rest of the day easily, without naps, no lessening of pain but it didn’t seem to matter. I was even able to do shopping that had been beyond me the previous week. It was 10 pm when I started to feel tired.
The next day I crashed and stayed crashed for 12 days. I can’t be sure that it wasn’t a ‘normal’ PM flare which would have happened anyway, but my sense was that it was the coffee. Coffee is a very powerful substance. So I did a little fishing to find out how it worked.
Coffee and other caffeine containing foods, over stimulate the adrenals, which depletes them and reduces the body’s natural production of cortisol. So I’m wondering what would happen if people nearing the 7.5 mgs of prednisone, stopped taking caffeine containing food and drinks until they were off the steroids. Would it kick start the body’s own cortisol production more quickly? Would they get off the steroids sooner. Has anyone tried anything like that?
Funny how it’s all the good things that over stimulate the adrenals. Alcohol, sugar and chocolate do too.
I’d be very interested to hear what those who know a bit more about steroids and PMR than I do might think about this idea.
Go well everyone

"Hi,
I’m new on the forum which I found a couple of weeks ago. Hope you don't mind a ring-in from Australia.
I was diagnosed with PMR early July. I might have already had it for a couple of years but thought it was just the usual muscle pains of growing older. I’m in my 70’s. Then in January I developed a dry cough, which went on for sixteen weeks. During that time I lost quite a bit of weight. The doctor said the cough wasn’t infectious so at the end of April I went on holiday for a camping retreat to a remote area of inland Australia. We slept in swags on a dry river bed but because of the unusual amount of rain this year, the sand wasn’t so dry and I woke every morning icy cold and me and the swag and my pyjamas were always sopping wet.
I returned home, really ill. The descent in the plane sent me completely deaf in the right ear which lasted three weeks and half deaf in the left. The cough I went with had become a lot worse and I had what I thought was flu. I’d also dropped more weight and had severe neck pain and dizziness.
At home the doctor ordered blood tests. My ESR was 91, and I was anaemic. She was concerned about the big drop in weight (which I wasn’t complaining about).
She started me on iron supplements and went on a search for why the inflammation markers were so high. I had two more lots of blood tests. My ESR went up to 92, then 98.
She referred me to a rheumatologist. By the time I got to see the rheumatologist, I had excruciating pain in my neck. It was also in my shoulders, groin and thighs and I was still having dizzy spells. I was diagnosed with polymyalgia. The rheumatologist said that with steroids I could be better by Christmas and wanted me to start on them there and then in the surgery.
I needed to think it over, did some research and seeing the huge number of nasty side effects decided not to go on the steroids but to try an immune strengthening approach which I’m still doing. It’s a tough choice but I’m not ready to go on steroids. I hope I won’t reach the point of not being able to get of bed though it’s been a near thing sometimes.
I started on the nutritional program two weeks after the diagnosis. Initially the areas that were painful spread and got more intense. Every part of my hip girdle and shoulder is involved including the area round the collar bones and in the groin at the base of the pelvis. I was very tired, sometimes I slept for 16 hours a day. On one occasion I wanted to lie down in the middle of the street except I knew if i did I wouldn't have been able to get up.
After 8 days on the nutritional program I had another blood test and my SED rate had gone down to 78.
I've now been on it for 8 weeks and feel more like a normal person though it hasn't touched the pain and stiffness.
Thankfully the doctor fully supports what I am doing and has even done some research for me. She’s told me to be alert for signs of GCA and what to do if I suspect it. I’m having regular blood tests and my SED rate has already dropped 20 points.
Well I’ve rattled on a bit haven’t I? I've got heaps of questions but they can wait.
This is truly a wonderful website, so much useful information and though I wouldn’t wish this nasty little number on anyone else, it’s very supportive to hear that that there are others out there who know exactly how painful and debilitating this PMR can be.
Is anybody else trying it without steroids at the moment?
Best wishes to all Jill48

"Hi, I am now in my 3rd year of the dreaded PMR. It pretty much rules my life, and my dose of prednisolone goes up and down like a yoyo. Just when I think I'm geting down to - say - 4 mg WHAM! the PMR comes back with a vengeance. As you all say the pain is debilitating and as a fitness teacher I manage with paracetamol before class - but what's that doing long term?
I wish there were some more info about why and how long this continues. My doc says it will disappear, but, as I added 1 mg today to combat hip pain, I do wonder if he's right.
One proven thing is - exercise is essential. If you don;t use it, you will certainly lose it with PMR.

"Just over a year ago I started getting aches and pains in my shoulders and upper legs (Thighs). As I am 64 I wondered if I had caught a virus or had a touch of Swine Flu. I have never experienced pain like it. No relief whether I was laying down or standing up. My husband had to shower me, dress me I couldn't lift my arms to comb my hair. Loss of appitite and thoroughly depressed as I am a very active person.
Fortunately my doctor recognised the symptons straight away and put me on 15mg of Prednisolone followed by a blood test. The readings were very high. I still wonder if it was a nasty fall I had that triggered it off.
One year on and although I am not in pain I am still stiff in the mornings. I do feel the weather has a lot to do with it. I'm now on 7.5mg and I'm trying to reduce the dose slowly by 1mg on alternate days. I am assured I will be cured but it might take up to another year.
The problem is I look well and at night could disco all night long! What you see is not what you get.
Has anyone had any pins and needles and a numbness in any area? Part of my left foot feels as though I've been stung by nettles! I've just had a Doppler done today, this is to see if I now have a circulation problem.
Didn't know what pills were a year ago now its, tablets for brittle bones, calcium, tabs to help me sleep. Is there no ending? I try to keep positive and say to myself there are people worse than me. Well bye for now, remember you are not alone!

"Dear All
We have been talking about Methotextrate in various threads.
I thought you might like to know that on the PMR&GCA Northeast Support website under Our Stories, the one by Margaret W (PMR Patient) has been updated. Margaret W has written about her experience \""A Year with Methotextrate\"".
There is also a place on this website we use which has information about metho and there is also a discussion forum like ours on PMR.
https://patient.info/medicine/Methotrexate.htm
Just remember, Metho is not a cure - just like Pred is not.
But, as the old adage says, knowledge is power and it helps if you know more than you ever wanted to.
I will be back with more info hopefully as I have asked a couple of awkward questions elsewhere.

"First can I say what a wonderful support this site has been to me over the last few months. I thought it was time I joined in with my story!
Looking back, I think I have been suffering from PMR for some time but had put the pains and general lack of fitness and mobility to age. Then in March, after a particularly stressful year, I finally retired at 64. One evening at the end of the month, I felt as if a ton of bricks had fallen on my head, mainly over my right eye. As one of those lucky people who can honestly say I have hardly ever had a headache in my life, it was a bit of a shock! But it was at the time when a lot of people around me were suffering from a virus which made them feel giddy and have the head ache so I thought no more of it.
After a few days, I went to the surgery and saw a locum who prescribed pain killers. The symptons got worse and worse, and I remember the following month as a long black tunnel, when I lost weight, had a dry cough, had no appetite, and just wanted to sleep. I went back twice more over the next three weeks and explained the symptoms only to be given stronger and stronger painkillers.
Then I went to my wonderful osteo lady to try to get some relief from my knotted and rigid neck and shoulders. She wouldn't touch me and told me to go back to my GP and insist on blood tests. The GP (grudgingly) agreed to do the tests and the next day, I got a call telling my to come to the surgery immediately. My score was 95, and I was immediately put on 60mg of steroids. The next day was bliss!
I am now down to 20mg but my GP is concerned that it has been 6 months on such a high dose as my SED score has gone back up to 50. I have an appointment (my first) with a Rheum Consultant next week, in the hope of getting me on to Metholextrate. I think she is a bit out of her depth with my problem so it will be good to have some back up.
On reading other stories, I am horrified to think I might have been so close to losing my sight.
Has anyone else had any experience of Metholextrate? I would be interested to know about the switch over from steroids.

mrs K to Dublin Ireland
Well done and you will love Antigua. Check the time difference as you need to adjust your steroid intake time.
I am no mathematician but somebody will be along who is.

Thanks Mrs K...I had not even thought about how the time difference would interfere with the steroids Rolling Eyes . At present I take my tablets about 8.30 am and Antigua are 4 hours behind us, so do you suggest taking them at 12.30 when away?
All advice welcome and hope I don't get stopped by the drug squad at the airport Laughing . I know it is a few weeks until I go but as the weather has got a lot cooler here in the last week I am looking forward to a bit of sun.

"I have always been a keen walker but with the onset of PMR at 65 my walking has been seriously affected. Just before I was put onto the Pred I struggled to mange a few hundred yards. I have now been on Pred for about 4 months and back on a high dose again after trying to reduce too quickly but I can usually manage to walk about a mile a day and sometimes 3 on a good day. I think it is important to exercise as much as is reasonably possible to help to reduce the muscle wasting effects that the Pred is known to have.
I have recently been trying Nordic Walking with great deal of success and I think that others with PMR might benefit too.
Firstly, it exercises the arms and shoulders, and to some extent the neck, which is where my PMR started. Secondly, it takes a bit of load of the legs which is where I am having the most trouble at the moment, and thirdly it is very much easier going up steep hills. The effect is quite dramatic, it’s almost like having 4 legs!
There are several websites which explain the principals of Nordic Walking and how to use and chose the poles. Some parts of the UK even run courses on it but I doubt that this is really necessary. The poles are available on-line at quite reasonable prices but I would advise against buying the adjustable ones. The adjustable part tends to slip, I had to modify mine so now they fixed length.

"My fingers are crossed whilst I type this (a feat in itself :lol: ). After 9 whole weeks of feeling really well after a pretty miserable year, the visit to my Consultant yesterday confirmed my hopes that things are looking up. ESR 5 CRP 2 - she was delighted. I'm staying on my (very) slow reduction and she doesn't want to see me for 6 months unless I have a flare-up. I started back at the gym on Monday, took it very easy and had no ill effects. My last two attempts were dismal failures!! Part of me feels guilty, posting how well things are going, but then I think back to when I felt so ill and I was really encouraged by people who were starting to feel better. I hope my post will help anyone feeling a bit down just now. I know how unpredicatable PMR is and I know there will be setbacks, but I'm making the most of my present good fortune. I asked the Consultant what were the chances of getting off the Prednisolone completely and she said about 70%. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this spell will last (and last).

"Well as promised I'm back to report that I'm off the Prednisilone. After two and a half years I'm finally there. I took the last one almost two weeks ago and so far so good. My only worry is that I am on pretty strong pain killers until I get my hip replacement on 8th October and they are masking anything. I don't think so though because my good leg and shoulders etc seem to be OK. It's so much better to be off the steroids and the weight is slipping away, peach skin and moon face gone (wrinkles back but hey ho!). So for all of you who are now where I was this time last year and feeling like there would be no end to this miserable complaint it does happen eventually so hang on in there and just be kind to yourself until it passes. My good wishes to you all.

I woke at 4.30 one morning this week, the usual horrid stiffness was hardly apparent, I made a drink, went back to bed, woke at 7 with the horrid stiffness all there, as usual. So the stiffness had arrived between 5ish and 7am.
This morning I woke at 6.00 am, that is early for me, again, minimal stiffness, I didn't go back to bed, have been active since then and wondering if this is going to \""catch up\"", if I sit still for more that 15 mins I feel stiff, I would normally anyway.

A month later went to GP who did a blood test and found my ESR was 90.
Started on predisolone which helped a lot cant remember the dose as it was very up and down tapering every time it got below 5mgs ESR went up again. Consultant put me on Methotrexate and started again to taper steroids ESR about 40. Then the hospital phoned to say was I feeling OK because last blood test showed slight liver changes. I got fed up at this stange and decided I'd had enough of tabs and as wasnt feeling bad gave up all meds. Now the aching has got worse again and ESR is at 64 .I am not really too bad in that I have two dogs and walk them every day after paracetamol but not quite as far as I used to.
I would love to know what other peoples ESR are doing and how long they have had this thing.

"Hello
I've recently come across this site and found it very interesting although I haven't read through all the threads yet so forgive me if I am asking something that has already been covered.
I started taking 15 mg of pred in October 2009 and reduced to about 2.5 mg in June 2010 but then got some symptoms back.
I've now come to terms with the disappointment and realise I probably reduced too quickly. I am now back up to 5 mg but still have some aches.
I was wondering if it was better to keep increasing the steroids again until the pains are no longer there and then reduce again or to up the steroids a bit to a manageable level and then stick.
What are other people's experiences?
Many thanks.

"My GP has mentioned several times that steroids help/mask other inflammatory conditions, eg. arthritis. I feel it is because she doesn't quite believe in pmr. She seemed to go along with the diagnosis only after the rheumy confirmed it. I do have osteoarthritis and it may be that is what is giving me lower back problems, besides twisting my back in a fall 6 months ago. It has got gradually better though I cannot walk more than a block (a few grocery aisles) before looking for a place to sit down. I can go farther leaning on a grocery cart. Recently I purchased a light weight folding sports seat that I can sling over my shoulder and sit down when needed.
I have been reducing at 1 mg every two weeks from 15 mg and am now down to 7 mg and feeling fairly well though have little energy. Have felt some pain and stiffness in knees and thighs since reducing from 9 mg. I think I am feeling some pmr because of the reduced dose. Some people describe pain on tapering as steroid withdrawal or pmr flair or blame more activity when feeling a little better. My GP would probably say I am feeling arthritis because of reduced steroid.
Just thought I would mention this as there might be something to feeling the effects of other things more when steroid is reduced. The rheumatologist I saw stated that we all have more than one thing going on.
I am happy with my tapering so far (this is my second round of pmr) and keeping fingers crossed. My GP said again that it was a very slow taper. I felt like telling her of some of the much slower tapers on this site!! No point though as I had just found out that she is leaving the clinic and there is no replacement. Somewhat relieved that I won't need to argue with her when I want to taper even slower (soon) but I will have to look for another doctor. She did prescribe me more steroid.
She told me that my back problem was arthritis and to take Tylenol Arthritis - 2 pills, 2x/day. It didn't help before but may try that again.
Will be back again to let you know how the tapering is going. I read others experiences regularly and have found a lot of helpful advice on this forum. I do feel that foods and spices that are anti inflammatory are doing some good.

"Hola 8) Arrived back last night from Spain having clocked up almost 4,000 miles during the six weeks away. All my fears regarding this holiday were unfounded - I feel so lucky. I felt really well on the journey down, really well whilst in Spain and still feel good :D . I continued with my Prednisolone reduction throughout the whole six weeks as it didn't seem to be effecting me at all and am now down to 6mgs. Most of you will know that I'm on the slowest reduction ever but it seems to be working so I'm sticking with it. My body doesn't seem to notice the 1 mg every 7 weeks reduction (so I'm not telling it!). Seeing the Consultant on Monday week and, apart from my weight (too much of everything good that Spain has to offer :redwine: :redwine:!!) I think she'll be pleased with me.

"I am now 51 and was diagnosed last year. I woke with girdeling in my groin area and unable to lift my arms. I was eventually put on prednison at 50 mg, then weaned down to 20 mg within 2 weeks. My Doctor lowered it to 17.5,two months ago. My Reumy lowerd it to 15.5 and two weeks later to 12.5 and this past monday to 10. I am stiff and have pain in my neck, shoulders and hips, but will hold it at 10 for a few weeks and hope it settles.
I do have a few questions. In the last 3 weeks I have had instant sweating, which is mostly the head and neck. This is even when I am not doing much. It drips from my eye brows, nose and even runs off my chin. Does prednisone cause this? Also my eye's blurr or ache at times, I have had headaches, but I used to have them a few years back. I dont have a tender scalp or swollen temples. I do have degenerated Vertibrea in my neck and the beggining of Osteo...this I blame on the numbness between the shoulder blades. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I sure would like to get the sweats under control. (I had menopause at age 43, done by 49)...so I do know this is different then hot flashes.

I'd tried going down a bit (to 13mg) unsuccessfully and then the flare set in. I eventually gave in and upped the dose to 15, then 16mg and finally 17mg. It was so-so, liveable with but not great.
Two or three days ago I decided to take 17.5mg as that means all enteric coated pills and I'd had a bit of stomach discomfort with taking some uncoated tabs to get the dose.
What a difference!! Two days of feeling pretty good, much less back discomfort (I won't grace it by describing it as pain)! :lol:
So - going down half a mg over two days really gave me gyp at one end of the scale and going up the half mg over two days has made such a difference at the other end. And doctors are suggesting drops of 1mg at a time, doing it every couple of weeks in some cases. I think they need to put their thinking caps on - or maybe their hearing aids in and listen to the patient on the receiving end! :roll:
Just saying!!!!!

I hope someone can help, or give me their opinion.
I am 49 year female and have had increasing aches over the last few years, visited Dr Friday, he asked why had not been before, I said I thought everyone ached as they got older. After listening to my symptoms he said he was going to test for Polymyalgia although I was too young.
I am fairly fit, active with 3 big dogs to exercise, work full time and correct weight for height.
Suffered migraines since I was 10 years old, these have changed in the last year or 2, less violent and more eye temple pain
Neck has always been dodgy since whiplash, 11 years ago
Bad shoulder for 5 years, partially resolved with physio but still nags and really bad if used too much, throwing ball for dogs, overhead use. Both shoulders and upper arms ache regularly
Knees, sore for a couple of years, upstairs sore, downstairs feel they will give way
Hips, last 6 months feel like they are locked after 10 minutes in a comfy chair
When I get up I waddle stiff legged until everthing frees up
Terrible cramps in feet, burning in shins
I am sore in most of these places all day everyday at a low level with occasional more pain in one or other
The thing that sent me to the Dr was I had horrible nauseous head for 4 days, very drowsy, pain would ease for an hour then change position or bend and back again, woke from a nap and left eye vision was very hazy, took an hour to correct, quite a few times in the morning it takes a while for me to see clearly.
I had a blood test Friday, rang for results today, apparently all 9 tests normal. Dr on hols so I have an appointment with him 1 Sept.
Does this mean I definitely do not have PMR, would be great because it seems that you all go through so much to get the condition settled and medication reduced.
Does anyone have any idea what other things he may suggest in the way of tests with these symptoms?
I know it will be opinion only but I would really appreciate that, I need to get this resolved.
Thanks in advance

"Hi All, I just need a good moan ! Iam still itching all over-Have been for weeks. Doc gave me Canesten with hydrocortisone for thrush under the bust a week ago. Rash has gone but it still itches like mad and doc says she hasn`t got a magic for the allover itch and it must be the steroids. So can I stop them ? No. Tried reducing this week but today the head pain started again. So- can`t getout ¬cos my emphysema is playing up.Can`t sleep at night for itching, cramp and restless legs. Cant read much ¬cos my eyes have been sore for months and Doc doesn`t seem interested. Went for an eye test yesterday and optician was horrified at how scratched my eyeballs were. The result of dry eyes which she said were a result of an auto immune disease like PMR. Oh and my moustache has come back !!!
Shall I just shoot myself now? Thanks for listening friends. Shebob :x

"hi
I'm interested if anyone has tried propalis or bee glue as it is also known
I have been taking it for a few years during the winter as it aids the immune system stops colds etc.
hadn't thought much more about since being diagnosed in April this year.
As I was having difficulty getting down from 15mg it occured (out of the blue) to start taking it again I am now down to 13 reducing every 2 weeks
apart from a tolerable shoulder ache I feel quite good.
It is an old remedy from the ancent Greeks and after all polymyalgia is a greek word!!

"Hi Everyone
I was diagnosed with PMR in March and started on Steriods
I have managed to reduce to 2.5 and although I have some pain and stiffness
it is bearable.
My problem is the tiredness I feel completely wiped out most of the time
does anyone else suffer this problem on such a low dose
Thanks

"Hi everyone, I have been reading all your experiences and most of my queries have been answered which I thank you all for. I am now in need a BIG MOAN so hear goes. I have GCA and heart problems and for the last eighteen months have been taking steriods started on 60mg got down to 7.5mg in July which I was pleased about but felt something was not quite right, thought it was the side effects of the reduction in steriods. No such luck, sent for blood test, you guessed it GCA full blown again back up to 40mg ,also given Methotrexate, folic acid, and doubled beta blockers. It was a hugh shock which sent me into abit of a depression which I think was more feeling sorry for myself than anything.
Now I have a mouthful of ulcers caused by the Methotrexate, which the Doc has now stopped and said we will find another alternative.
Feel abit better now I have had a moan. Like all of you the only thing we can do is keep battling on day by day.

"Hello everyone on what I hope is a good day for you all.
Have any of you tried hydrotherapy for your PMR and, if so, I wondered if you have found it of benefit?
I have discovered a hydro pool not very far away where the pool is heated to 34-36 degrees and there are gradual steps down into the water. I've missed the boat regarding cost - it was free for over-60's until last month but the Government has now banned this 'luxury'! It's now £6.30 for 30 mins but they tell me I will have a quiet pool as many over-60's have now stopped going - well there's a surprise! I thought I'd give it a try and see if it helps with the continuing PMR stiffness and my spinal problem which is causing horrid sciatic pain. I will let you know if I find it helpful.

"Hi Everyone,
I have just registered with this site as 8 weeks ago I was diagnosed with PMR. After being in agony for about 3months I am now able to get back to a normal way of life due the prednisolone I was prescribed.
My problem is that neither the consultant I saw at the hospital or my GP have given me much information about what to expect as I reduce my dose or which side effects are serious and need to be reported to my GP. The consultant handed me back to my GP so she could monitor my treatment and I do not have another app at the hospital. My GP organises blood tests every 4 -5 weeks and phones to say these are normal. When I mentioned some side effects and areas of persistant pain she did not seem very interested and said it was a necessary to find a balance between being able to amnage these and taking the lowest does of steroids possible. I have reduced from 25ml to 10 ml in the last seven weeks. I still have pain in my pelvis but can put up with that at the moment after being practically unable to move before my diagnoses.
Other problems I am experiencing are severe cramps mostly in the night, hot flushes, bloating, swolen ankles and a sore mouth. Are these symptoms normal? I feel the sore mouth is caused by the calcium suppliments I am taking and have tried both chewable tablets and effervesant tablets. Do I really need to take the calcium suppliments or would it be possible just to eat a high calcium diet?
I am also having difficulty stopping smoking which was the only advice the consultant gave me. I have not mentioned this to my GP because I am so ashamed. Neither health care professional have suggested abstaining from alcohol and I continue to have a few glasses of wine. Should I be doing this?
I would be really greatful for any help and advice anyone could offer and any insites into what I can expect to happen in the future.
Regards

"Hello fellow sufferers I'm just posting to give hope to those who read all of the messages and wonder if there is light at the end of what seems an interminable tunnel. I have been suffering for 2 years and 4 months and have had some very low points along the way with up and down on steriods (40mg a day at one point when they suspected GCA). However I am now down to 1mg per day and in three weeks time should take the last one. Going down from 10 to 1 mg(drop 1 every 4 weeks) has been slow but sure and each drop has had it's challenges but I found that once I was past the first week of the drop things go better and by the fourth week I was fine and ready to take the next drop.
I am now slowly losing the weight I put on (and this has always been a problem) and the moon face has gone (wrinkles back and so glad to see them LOL). Peach fuzzy face gone too.
I know not everyone on this site has had such good fortune but I know when I was at my lowest I just wanted to know that some people do get through it and get better and so I'm posting this for those who are now where I once was.
Good fortune to you all and hope you are soon PMA and Steriod Free

"Hi Everyone 8) 8) . Four weeks into our holiday and as the Spanish dongle thingy is working I thought I would give you a quick update. We drove 1,567 miles over four days (I was dreading it) but I felt so well all the way. I was full of energy when I arrived and have felt great the whole time since. It’s very, very hot and that hasn’t affected me the way it did last year. I can swim, walk, eat and drink (!) :donut: :redwine: and all this whilst still reducing the Prednisolone. What has happened? I’m not complaining but it’s as though someone just flicked a switch a couple of weeks before we left home. I wake up every morning expecting to feel rough but it hasn’t happened (yet?). It doesn’t sound as though it’s been a great summer in the UK but if it’s any consolation we had the mother of all storms last night and it’s cloudy today. We’ve two more weeks and then have to repeat the 1,500 miles but in one less day, so we’ll see how that goes. My only problem? I’ve put on a considerable amount of weight! When I started on 15mgs my appetite just vanished, as I go down (now on 7mgs) I get more and more hungry, I’m sure that’s the wrong way round!! My very best wishes to everyone and hope you’re all having a good weekend. Lizzie Ellen

"I've read so much on this forum over the last year... what stands out is that most of us feel awful, are hyper at 2am, are hurting and anxious, tetchy and forgetful, overweight and finding exercise near impossible, so I thought a little light humour might help. Feel free to add more...
EXERCISES FOR PEOPLE OVER 50 ... and good information for future use for those who have not yet reached the half century mark.
Begin by standing on a comfortable surface, where you have plenty of room at each side.
With a 5-lb potato sack in each hand, extend your arms straight out from
your sides and hold them there as long as you can.
Try to reach a full minute, and then relax. Each day you'll find that you
can hold this position for just a bit longer.
After a couple of weeks, move up to 10-lb potato sacks. Then try 50-lb.
potato sacks and then eventually try to get to where you can lift a 100-lb
potato sack in each hand and hold your arms straight for more than a
full minute. (I'm at this level)
After you feel confident at that level, put a potato in each of the sacks.
(very suitable for pmr patients!)
An elderly gent was invited to an old friend's
home for dinner one evening.
He was impressed by the way his buddy preceded every
request to his wife with endearing terms such as: Honey, My Love, Darling, Sweetheart, Pumpkin, etc.
The couple had been married almost 60 years and,
clearly, they were still very much in love.
While the wife was in the kitchen , the man leaned
over to his host, 'I think it's wonderful that after all these
years, you still call your wife those loving pet names'.
The old man hung his head. 'I have to tell you
the truth,' he said, 'Her name slipped my mind about
10 years ago and I'm too scared to ask the old biddy
what it is'
There's nothing worse than a doctor's receptionist who insists you tell her what is wrong with you in a room full of other patients.
An 86-year-old man walked into a crowded doctor's waiting room. As he approached the desk, the receptionist said, \""Yes sir, what are you seeing the doctor for today?\""
\""There's something wrong with my penis,\"" he replied. The receptionist became irritated and said, \""You shouldn't come into a crowded doctor's waiting room and say things like that.\""
\""Why not? You asked me what was wrong and I told you,\"" he said.
The receptionist replied, \""You've obviously caused some embarrassment in this room full of people. You should have said there is something wrong with your ear or something and then discussed the problem further with the doctor in private.\""
The man replied, \""You shouldn't ask people things in a room full of others, if the answer could embarrass anyone.\""
The man walked out, waited several minutes and then re-entered.
The receptionist smiled smugly and asked, \""Yes,\""
\""There's something wrong with my ear,\"" he stated.
The receptionist nodded approvingly and smiled, knowing he had taken her advice. \""And what is wrong with your ear, Sir?\""
\""I can't piss out of it,\"" the man replied.
The waiting room erupted.

"Hi everybody,
Just wondered if anyone else had experienced an all over itch. It`s driving me mad , even the backs of my hands are itchy. I had it once before after a COPD exacerbation and at that time it was diagnosed as thyroiditis. But my doc says a thyroid test six weeks ago was okay so she doesn`t think it`s that. The only place there`s a rash is under my bust. I`ve tried Daktarin, Eumax, Teatree and E45 with no success. I`m getting so bad tempered and have been on the old prednisolone for 14 months now and we seem to blame everything on them but I haven`t seen any other mention of the dreaded itch. Anybody else out there ?

"Hello all! I have spent a few days reading all of your experiences and your great advice..what a useful website this is - thank you! I was expecting to be registering this evening as a fellow sufferer as to me, my symptoms seem spot on to what you describe...but my bloods came back today 'as normal as can be' says the doc! Great news in many respects of course, but funnily enough that news didnt make my pains disappear?!?
I told her that I had been reading up on the topic and that it seemed quite common that bloods can come back normal, and some docs will commence steroids as a sort of back-up diagnosis and see how things go over a week or so. She was having none of that and is going to try me on anti-inflammatories...again...sigh! Im to give those a couple of weeks and if they are no good she will refer me to a rheumatologist.
A bit of background to my situation. Two years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy and was thankfully given the all clear with a prescription for Tamoxifen for the next 5 years. Then around this time last year I had reconstructive surgery followed by 3 months off work to recover, and it was on my return to work that I realised that I just didnt feel right. I had suffered the pain on turning over in bed of course following my surgery, so I kind of accepted that and didnt take much notice when it kicked off again long after I was healed. I used to joke to people that I must be getting old (I am 51) as on waking I feel like I am paralised - the shoulders and base of my back...well...yow! I have to get up at least a couple of hours before leaving for work as it takes my body that long to be able to function. Then there was the stiffness across my back - from hip to hip, which has over the last months become progressively worse so that just an hour or so into my shift I am unable to take another step with so much pain. As it is, I am hobbling around all of the time. Much of my pain on walking is down just one leg...I think it is the way I am walking to try and combat the stiffness in the hips? I cant do stairs other than on all fours, as putting weight on that leg makes it feel like it will break in half. I have fatigue, feeling hot a lot of the time (where I used to feel cold all the time). Driving to work is reasonably ok, but driving home is a nightmare...having done a shift I am done in. I only work 5 hours shifts - in a supermarket zapping products. Its not heavy work but I am on my feet a lot. I told the doctor that after the week I have had, I cannot go on like this - things are feeling worse and worse by the day. The blood tests looked for polymyalgia and also rheumatoid arthritis with no sign of either showing up. I have also had x-rays to my hips and pelvic area, again all clear.
I already take cocodamol 30/500's and gapapentin for nerve damage to my arm following my surgery...but as strong as these are, they do not touch the stiffness and pain in the shoulders and hips.
I will give the anti-inflammatories a fair go and hope for the best, but I wanted to say hello, and ask...if these dont help, does anyone have any advice on how can I get my doctor on-side while I wait for weeks no doubt for a referral?
Thank you for being here folks!

She remains in the most awful pain and it breaks my heart to see her like this. She is taking 10mg Predisolone along side the Methatrexate but nothing seems to help. I pray that the 18 month- 2year burn out might just happen but at the moment I fear she will never be pain free. She was a really young 72 year old but now can barely walk and is in constant pain.

I am hoping that it will get to my feet then walk away (some hope).
The pain in my knees continues through the day although not as bad as when I first wake up. It is really annoying as I find that if i walk for anylength of time I pay the price the next day.

"Hi all!
Whilst catching up on reading the medical blogs that make me laugh and keep me reasonably sane (only reasonably, mind :lol: ) I found a link to this post by a doctor in the USA which I thought you might all find interesting and thought-provoking. It is a comment from the other side of the fence, reminding us all about the challenges faced by the medical profession when they meet with us, the patient with the chronic disease.
Many of us have met the doctor who doesn't want to listen, the one who is ignorant of the facts about our little-known ailment, the one who thinks he or she is above God because of their medical degree. Some of us are blessed in having a wonderful doctor who is none of these things and willing to learn from us and the other patients who provide for their own advocacy by learning about their disease.
Musings of a Distractible Mind posted \""A Letter to Patients with Chronic Disease\"" on July 14th 2010 - Google that lot and you will find it. Towards the end of the post he gives a couple of links to more posts as he develops the theme. I recommend you to read them all - for together we are stronger and we should endeavour to find partners in our illnesses who will go the extra mile to seek for a solution to our needs. The end of that journey may be the cure we need for PMR.

I have suffered from PMR for last 3 years. I have gone from 20mg to 3mg. I love this site as you get information and more importantly realise you are not alone. I was wondering how many of you out there have problems with sleeping. I can fall asleep and then wake up with pain in my hip and knee joints, then I have great difficulty in turning over. I was 50 a few months ago and just feel that I'm too young to have to suffer. My doctor who gives me blood tests on a regular basis says the pain has to do with predisolone withdrawal as my esr results are clear. I also have difficulty getting up from my seat but once I am mobile I don't have any difficulty getting around and am able to walk distances and also play golf.
Pretty knackered the next day though. Thanks for listening.

Looking for some advice as feel a bit lost with it all. I was diagnosed with PMR in March 2009 and have been taking prednisolone with no real success as every time i try and cut down the dosage the symptoms get worse so have to raise the dose again, my inflammation levels remain high and work is nearly all but impossible and had so much time off as cant lift my arms, sometimes i cant even get out of bed. My doctor says the steriods should be helping and should be starting to feel better and doesnt know why im not bouncing about, they have advised me to give methrotrexate a go but im not sure has anyone else been on it or can recommend it or can advise me on any ways i can cope day to day which is a massive struggle any help is really appreciated.

"Hi all...Unlike my consultant (known me for 4 months), who assures me I look fine,my GP (knows me 20yrs)was quite concerned about my weight loss and went so far as to tell me I looked mal-nourished !! He feels that I may have developed an over-active Thyroid aswell as having the PMR, as I am totally exhausted after doing precious little and am feeling very warm all the time. He has sent off some blood tests, but won't have results for a few days, so will have to wait and see what they turn up.I have also now developed high blood pressure...another first for me. I really feel like my body is starting to fall apart rapidly, and having read the Daily Mail article I wonder if a viral stomach bug I had back in March kick started this whole sorry saga...my PMR symptoms started about 3 weeks after I eventually got over that illness....so who knows, but it does seem to follow the train of the article.best wishes to all.Dublin

I was started on 40mgs deltacortril (prednisalone) & have been on a tapering programme over the last 6 weeks. I am now down to 17.5mgs & will go down to 15 in 2 weeks if my bloods are still OK. I still have to supplement steroid use with painkillers (Arcoxia & Tramadol) but my rheumy wants to get steroids down ASAP as I have managed to LOSE weight while on them...and I was already a bit underweight for my height !! I am delighted to report that, despite a very gloomy first 2 months with this, I am definately making progress, and have even been able to return last week to my beloved golf, albeit in a buggy with a doctors cert!! The main inconvenience I find with this illness is the unpredictability....one day great...the next not so good...and you really have to pace yourself and listen to your body. I know now, that if I do one physical activity a day, that I cannot do another aswell...or i pay the price the next day !!

I wish I could be back to normal but it is interesting that so many people find it difficult to come off steroids altogether.

"Hi everyone
I have run into a brick wall at 3 mg of Pred. I reduced by 1 mg a month down to 5, then went to 1/2 mg a month doing 5 - 41/2 on alternate days for a week, then the same method down to 3mg where I'm stuck. I have tried 3-21/2 and it's ok untill I stay on 21/2 mg and 3 days later all the old pain comes back. Has anyone else had this problem getting by a certain number? If so how did you get by. My goal was to be off pred completely by the end of the year but now I don't know. I even tried to stop riding my bike to see if I could get over the hump but it didn't help. I can take pain killers [Percocet] and that helps but it's like a trade off. I want to be off all medication. Well at least the sun is shinning.

"Hi all!
I know it sounds a silly question but I wondered if any of you would like to provide me with some anecdotal information!
1. When did your PMR first appear - i.e. what time of year? Summer, winter?
2. How many of you feel noticeably better once the sun starts to shine and is it just once the weather is more cheerful or once you actually start to go outside? When you go out do you ALWAYS use a sunscreen - or do you not bother for short trips outside, e.g. to go to the shops.
3. Those of you who \""go south\"" - do you notice a difference in how you feel with the PMR after a week or so?
4. How often do you eat oily fish (salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines)? If you eat a lot, does your PMR feel better?

"we are very worried about my mother in law, who was diagnosed with PMR about a year and a half ago by her GP, who seems to be the one managing (??) the condition. She had been feeling very tired and achey for quite some time, and then got the dignosis and was put on steroids, which over time she has cut down to, I believe, 7.5mg a day (is that right??)
The problem is tht I dont believe that she has got the grip of the condition, and I am alo of the belief that the GP, for some reason or other, is not doing quite all that he could be.
She has had several bouts of terrible illness, mainly seem to be brought on by eating, and quite often these are high carb meals, which reading on your site are not the best. She then gets terrible stomach problems, and ends up in bed for a few days. She is a farmers wife, think she is about 72ish, and still tries to be very very active - walking dogs, gardening, going to art classes, running a holiday cottage (which involves cleaning and ironing), doing the accounts, keeping the house and cooking for a demanding husband (to whom her illness seems a bit of a nusience), As well as having a bit of asocial life too.
The last few months she has not been right at all. She says the doctor has checked her levels and she doesnt need to change the steroids, and I think she cant work out why she has been so rotten. she seems shakey, even her voice seems shaky, and its as if she is becoming old in front of my eyes. I am concerned that they have not given her any calcium, as she has already had 2 knee replacements, I am wondering if she is also anaemic. They have had her at the hospital and done scans and all the oscopies, and they didnt spot anything. The doctor just said she was eating too much, but then she never seems to tell him the whole story. she is so weak that she fell taking the builders their tea and has been in bed since friday, and when the doctor came she didnt even tell him that she had spent most of the previous week in bed too. She probably forgot as she seems to be getting muddled too.
The only time she has been good was when she went to stay with her daughter in Scotland for a few days, but the daughter has ME so only does a very little amount each day.
Today apparantly she decided that the answer was to move to scotland, as she now thinks the stress of money (the farm runs on a shoestring) is the problem. Personally I believe she needs to get down to the hospitals rheumatology department and get under an expert, and to learn that sh can only do a limited amount each day.
Does this sound familar to anyone. If I can find examples of how people are, even with steroids, I think she may understand better. I think that she thought steroids would make everything normal again.
thank you

"Hi everyone,
Just diagnosed, I am 53 year old woman, had stressful start to the year then this seemed to kick in. I wanted to say how useful I have found these posts, taking tablets in the morning has helped, I was getting a detatched weird feeling about 2 hours before tablets were due, that seems ok now.
Took 20mg for a month, now on 15mg, going onto 10 next week, the adjustment period seemed to be about 2 weeks of feeling odd and sometimes increased pain.
It's the inconsistency that is difficult, I have odd days of feeling close to normal then days where I am quite stiff, there doesn't seem to be an obvious pattern - is this \""normal\""?

"Hi to all that remember me, it's been a long time again, but I am still here and looking in regularly. I have been stirred to action because someone has mentioned metho and that is something I do know about.
First, the house move is over and done with and we are very happy in our new home. It was not an easy time as I was hospitalized just a month before the moving date (I will go into that shortly) and was just plain terrified of overdoing it all and undoing all the good work which the consultant and the hospital had done.
The new home is not properly sorted yet (we are currently having a patio built) but the end of this month should see all the work done and then we can start enjoying the fun bits.
To get to the hospital bit - I started Methotrexate early last November with the intention of getting me off steroids asap, I was then on 5mg daily and had stuck there. As luck would have it, in January I got a severe chest infection and they upped the steroids to 30mg daily as they usually do. That was my downfall.
I had the most awful struggle trying to get the Pred down again - I've struggled before but this was something else! I made it fairly easily to 20mg and there I stuck.........every time I went lower within a few days (even doing it slowly) I had the kind of flare that made me feel 'unprintable'.
I did manage to get down to the 15 simply by putting up with it but I was barely functioning. Over Easter and the week following I was feeling very ill and knowing that I already had an appointment with the consultant for 19th April I put the dose back up to the 20 just so that I could cope with some of the packing and sorting out for a few days.
At my appointment - well, she took one look at me and had me admitted on the spot which completely flabbergasted me. I was given a steroid injection the day I was admitted to help me over the tapering and by the time I got home I was already down to 12.5 daily - no, I couldn't believe it, either. I think also those days when I [i:3a7269fc10]couldn't[/i:3a7269fc10]do anything at home and the consequent release from the stress and tension (from guilt,I think) also helped.
This is the beginning of the 4th week in our new home and I am now down to 7.5 daily and about to begin a very slow taper to 5mg (again - I shall cheer when I get there).
I am now also on the maximum dose of Metho (25mg weekly) and during this last two months in spite of the reductions in Pred I have not had one flare-up even though we were having very exciting days. I have had a few 'off' days of course, but mainly due to tiredness.
It is one of the few drugs with which I have had minimal side effects - nothing worth speaking about - and if it is necessary to minimise or end the steroids completely, well, if you are offered it, it is definitely worth a try.
The side effects recorded are frightening - but then so are those given for Prednisolone (and I have always felt that I have had about 70 of the 82 recorded for Pred). Metho also has the advantage that it can be stopped and started at will if the need arises, no tapering or slow reductions required. As that is so, I don't think anyone can turn down the chance to[/i]try[i:3a7269fc10] it - if you don't try, you will never know!
I hope that now the dust has died down (literally) I should be able to get back to regular postings again, but I have said that before so I am not holding my breath!

"Hi everybody!
I've noticed that a few people have mentioned Pilates in their posts and since I feel that I benefited considerably from the Pilates classes I went to before I was diagnosed I thought I'd stick together a few thoughts of my own and ask what others thought too as there have been a few threads about non-drug coping with PMR.
First a bit of my background: I had the symptoms of PMR for nearly 5 years before I was diagnosed and tried a whole range of physical therapies, both privately and through the NHS, to try and get some relief. I'd been using my local ladies-only gym quite a bit when the PMR started - it manifested itself as agonising pain in my thigh muscles when I tried to use the cross-trainer or bike. Over a period of a few months I realised that I was less and less able to cope with the classes I attended and decided I would have to change to a gym with a swimming pool if I was to get value-for-money. It was a case of \""it's an ill wind that blows no good\"" because by my changing to a gym a few miles away a whole new world opened up to me. There was a pool - where they held an aqua aerobics class every day - and they also had a few different Pilates and yoga classes. I was too scared to try the yoga but I had done Pilates before and found the new teacher was even better - and eventually I did try the Iyengar yoga class which was also superb.
Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates, a German who came to England in 1912 and was interned during the First War. During this time he developed a system of pulley-like machines to allow injured patients to work against resistance whilst still in bed to prevent muscle wasting. Many Pilates studios still use this type of equipment in their training but what is much more often found in fitness studios/gyms is what is called modified Pilates - based on the mat exercises developed by JP. The exercises have been adapted by physiotherapists over the years and former back patients are often surprised to find how many of the exercises are very similar to ones they have been taught by their physios. The emphasis is on strengthening the \""core muscles\"" - your internal abdominal muscles - in particular, and on control. There are no points to be scored by doing more and faster or bigger repetitions of the exercises and you are encouraged to work at your level at all times. When your core muscles are strong it improves your posture which, in turn, helps with back pain, joint pain and, perhaps strangely, stamina.
Not all the exercises are done on a mat, there are also a whole range done in a standing position and I found them to be excellent for getting my shoulders and hips mobilised. Very occasionally we worked with a gym ball (the big diameter ones you can sit on) and I really enjoyed that.
I can hear you saying \""But if I got down on a mat I'd never get up again\""! It sometimes used to take me far longer than the others to get into position - especially a comfortable one - but my teacher was doing a college course in sport science and was specialising in rehabilitation. Her placement towards the end was 4 weeks at Catterick at the Army barracks, working with soldiers after injury. This meant she was particularly helpful to any of us who had health problems and she adapted any movement that proved too difficult or showed us something else to do. She consistently encouraged us not to take any notice of what others were doing but to work at our own pace and level.
Over the 4 years I did Pilates I saw a massive improvement in my posture and mobility - and remember, this was before I was diagnosed as having PMR but had the symptoms! I found it easiest when I had had an aqua class beforehand or some other opportunity to get loosened up but even without that, the warm-up series of movements we did at the start of the class were perfect for lindering the shoulder and hip stiffness.
One-to-one classes are the ideal, I suppose, but they tend to be seriously expensive. However, there are teachers out there who are excellent who work in fitness studios and even council gyms! My gym membership was an off-peak one aimed at the retired - Monday to Friday until 5pm and was very reasonably priced at £35-ish, particularly when you consider that I had up to 5 aqua classes, 2 Pilates and 1 yoga class available to me. In most places an aqua class alone costs over £5 by the time you pay for the entrance to the pool and the class and I won't even think about yoga classes! And I also had the use of the gym (I hated it, boring!) and the pool, sauna and steam room - also brilliant for PMR, I found. I had had lots of physio and 2 very good Pilates teachers who were very interested in making sure they were teaching well and correctly so could tell if a teacher was competent or not - and never went back to a dodgy one, especially anyone who sang the \""no pain, no gain\"" mantra. A good way to go about it might be a few high standard (expensive) classes, maybe with a physio, to start with and then look for something more reasonable at a studio. And judging by the texts I keep getting from my old gym 18 months after leaving to move here they seem to be desperate for custom in the recession and the prices should be competitive!
In addition to the mobility and strength benefits of going to the gym I found that it also gave me the impetus I needed to go out - even on a day when I felt so down all I really wanted to do was go back to bed! If I had a morning class I didn't go to any great shakes getting dressed (by which time I would have been so exhausted I would have to sit for half an hour before I could do anything else). I put on my swimming costume and used the pool-side shower or gym stuff and showered afterwards - with the easiest top and bottoms I could find, no-one cared at the gym! It was much easier afterwards. I made some new friends - but I knew I would always have some company - and that helped the depressive mood of PMR no end. And I definitely felt better!
Has anyone else got any thoughts in this regard that others might find helpful or encouraging?

"Hello everyone
I went to a talk on Nordic pole walking this morning and am due to start an 8-week course in September. Many of you will remember that Nordic pole walking was recommended for PMR sufferers on this site by a Mr A during last summer (I think the thread is PMR and Nordic Walking if anyone wishes to look it up).
Whilst there I met a lady who had PMR and GCA 10 years ago and fully recovered in 3 years. I was particularly interested to hear that, like me, she had recovered from the two conditions as I have heard that it can be more difficult to get off steroids completely with GCA.
My co-ordination was a little out of sync when I tried the poles for a few seconds this morning so I just hope they will be safe in my hands and that I don't poke anyone, but then if Eileen can handle her ski-ing poles it can't be that bad can it?!!!

"I don't want to be boringly repetitive but, in case someone new is reading this I'll just give,briefly, my PMR history.
I am 28 months in to my second bout, the first having cleared completely after three years. That was in 1999 - 2002.
No-one ever queried the diagnosis; I was a classic case.
For some reason a different doctor in the Practice said it would be a good idea to \"" get into the system\"" and referred me to the local rheumatology dept. I now regret agreeing to this.
I arrived in very good time for my appointment and was weighed, measured and had BP taken. Over an hour later nothing had happened and only one patient had been seen. Another patient had the same time as I had for his apppointment and a third was scheduled half an hour earlier. Finally yet another patient appeared and went straight into the Consultant's office. Apparently she ahd been held up in X-Ray
On enquiring I was told that there was a mistake about my appointment time. It should have been half an hour later. This I was able to demonstrate was not so as I had my print out with me having used the \""Choose and Book\"" internet system. I pointed this out and was surlily informed that \""There are sometimes delays.\""
At this point I said I was not prepared to sit in the overheated, unventillated, windowless waiting area any longer. There were now two people ahead of me and the going rate seemed to be about one patient every 40 minutes. I came home having decided this was not a system that I wanted to get into.
Naturally, I let my GP know and said that I did not think thet the RH. Dept had anything to offer me that I was not already receiving from my local, ( beautifully run ) surgery.
On telling my sister who worked in the NHS for thirty years this story she said that she had actually heard said that Consultants' time was more valuable than Patients' and that if they did not want to wait they should go privately. So now we know!
Not only do I resent the attitude but would have no faith in anything offered by such a service

My big problem at the moment is vertigo and a feeling of light-headedness :weird: Is this yet another thing I can blame on the Prednisolone or the PMR? Or, I wonder, is this something unrelated to those two and maybe needs a quick visit to the GP? Anyone out there getting this? Its not constant, but once again this morning, when I got out of bed this morning I almost fell over and have felt light-headed all day.

I'm being rather needy at the moment I'm afraid! Has anyone had the experience of shoulder aches (both sides) and rib cage too? I am at the end of my first week of 7.5mg (after a very gradual slow reduction regime) and wonder if this is the PMR returning or steroid withdrawal symptoms and maybe if I wait a few days, it will stop. I did have a bit of a fight with some luggage which I carry around in the boot of my car yesterday and wonder also if that can have affected it? I don't think my job is helping as I have to carry quite heavy stuff around (in and out of the car).

I have been fantastically lucky so far, as after 2 long months when my most used word was \""Aaaargh!\"" my GP diagnosed PMR as soon as he saw me and gave 20mgs of Prednisolone.After 3 hours Ifelt at least 30 years younger,with no pain at all and the euphoria is still there- my husband finds it a bit wearing!

After2 months I'm now down to 7.5 mgs.
My other reason for writing isthat before I retired I used to be a welfare benefits adviser to people with disabilities, mainly on Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA). Although I may be out of date on some parts, I do not think much has changed in these, so if there is anyone struggling with a claim, I might be able to help. The way the forms are filled is absolutely crucial. If you have been refused AA or DLA don't be put off asking for a review - in my experience most first claims fail and most reviews succeed :lol:

"I would be most grateful for any help and advice. At the end of February I started to get night sweats, slight nausea and the most awful pain in my neck/shoulder, making it extremely difficult to turn over in bed or move my head. The only relief was to get up. After a couple of weeks I noticed at night not only was my neck and shoulder painful , but my lower back and hips started to ache. The pain in my shoulder and hips does start to ease during the day which is bearable, but it seems to be most painful when my body is at rest. I have been to see my G.P. on several occasions who has said he can find nothing wrong and advised I see an osteopath. After 7 sessions with the osteopath and no relief she wondered whether I may have the symptoms of PMR and said I must return to G.P. My G.P. was very dissmisive of PMR and said I definately was not suffering from the condition, but reluctently took blood tests which showed no sign of inflamation. The G.P. then made an instant diognosise of Fibromyalgia. When I asked what this was she said to look it up on the computer which would probably give me all the info I needed. The G.P then gave me a prescription for 25mg of Amitripyline to be taken at night to help with pain. I have looked at the Fibromyalgia web site but I do not think I fit the criteria. Really don't know what to do next. Would appreciate help/advice.

We were thrilled to find they were there when we arrived a couple of weeks ago. After lots of fumbling in the brain trying to remember our rather rusty Spanish, Jesus starting to describe what illness he was suffering from. It turns out that he also has PMR!!! Him and Fortu, like us, just couldn't believe that we were both suffering from the same problem (and being treated almost identically). It appears that both our symptoms first started last May whilst we were holidaying in the Costa Blanca.

"This article in today's Guardian covers a wide range of problems encountered by sufferers and those who seek to help them ( or not ).
We are, mostly, more fortunate inasmuch as our condition is almost universally accepted as genuine by the medical profession but we all know how infuriating it is to be greeted by people who tell us how well we look!
We also hear frequently of PMR/GCA sufferers having to wait too long for diagnosis because they are the\""wrong\"" age, gender, do not have enough markers.
In today's political climate it is particularly worrying that there are people being told that they ARE fit for work when the genuinely are not. This COULD, perhaps has, apply to our \""community\""

Briefly, I have had problems with my major joints for the last 5 years. Seen my GP who has been helpful who initially sent me to a podiatrist. Result insoles. Then to hospital for x rays on my knees. Result osteoarthritis in both knees cartilage damage to one, naproxen prescribed, the side effects of which are unpleasant. 2 years ago had Bursitis in my right elbow operated on just in time to walk my daughter down the aisle[thanks Dr. N]
Since then just been putting up with the pain until about 8 weeks ago. Felt dreadful, aches pains, thought I was coming down with flu and have been basically immobile since.
Sorry I know I said briefly. I would however, be grateful of any info advice etc.

"I saw my GP today and she told me the rheumatologist had recommended the following taper: Starting from 20 mg, reduce 1 mg every 2 weeks. The GP mentioned several times that she felt this was VERY slow. I, on the other hand, was very relieved as I thought she might try to rush me on this. It seems different from other tapers I have heard about. I will see how it goes and let you know. She is leaving it up to me to increase again if necessary and to try to find out if I can taper to O or at what level I need to maintain.
My recent sed rate was 35 elevated slightly from previous but GP said might have been due to my fall and straining back muscles. Have had a lot of trouble with my back but it seems to be gradually improving and pmr pretty much under control at this time.

"I read this site every day and have learned a lot. Would appreciate some input. I have had pmr for a couple of years and finally diagnosed in Nov 09. Started on 10mg ... down to 7 1/2mg ... down to 5mg for 2 months and now 4mg for 2 months. For about the last month, some where between 1pm and 4pm, I get extremely nervous ... anxious ... my hands start to hurt. Then I have these sweats. I was in the car today and it hit me. I stopped at McDonals's and got a quarter pounder and by the time I got home I was ravenous. I took a xanax and then a glass of wine. My hands were really shaking.
Is this a hypoglycemic reaction? ... anxiety? ... related to pmr? ... related to pred?I am confused. I have tried to prevent this by eating about 12:30 to no avail.
Thanks for your help.

"Hi all
Just as you think all is going well, down to 3 mg pred. riding the bike longer and stronger, getting my weight down to pre Prednisone numbers my Doctor sent me for a Bone Scan and the results come back as Osteoporosis. I was taking Calcium with vitamin D, eating my fruits and veg. riding the bike up to 150 miles per week [find out now bicycle riding can promote bone loss as in a lot of sweat but no weight bearing]. This is a warning to all the men out there taking prednisone for PMR Osteoporosis is not just a womens problem get a bone scan before you break a bone.
At least it's geting warmer in New England [75f today] which certainly makes the aches and pains feel a little better.
Thanks for listening
Andy
PS. my computer crashed and I had a hard time finding my way back to this site on my new one. I really missed reading all your comments and experiences in the morning [it's become a daily ritual]

"Saw the Dr yesterday and had good blood results 5 and 5 and I havent been that low for a while
I had a cold and sore throat last week and had a blood test booked for my local surgery Friday but I know this had affected the results before so I cancelled this and went up to my nearest city hospital on Monday when I hoped I would feel better and it paid off !! I have struggled since Jan so wanted a lift and wouldnt have wanted a false reading
I have been on 10 successfully for a month and the aim is now 7.5 where my Dr said they like to get you there as they feel at that level steroids arent damaging you
I discussed with her the things mentioned to her on this forum alternate day therapy and the very slow regime suggested by Lissie Ellens Rheumatologist 1mg every 7 weeks She is open to suggestions and has just said to play around with it and see how I feel and has again offered me another Rheumatologist appointment if I want it but I do get excellent care
I am considering 10 10 7.5 and see how that goes When I get say to 5 I am definately going to look into the alternate day therapy to try and kick start my Adrenal glands ( so I will be looking for nadvise on that )
Off to Spain for a week on Saturday so will be relaxing then only the travelling to contend with and unfortunately its Heathrow as it is our transferred BA flight from Xmas !! I just love my local airports now
When I get back it will be tackle the weight gain and more exercise but that has just increased generally with the better weather and being out and about and I do find I am moving at my more normal speed rather that a slow shuffle !!
Best wishes to all and hope my bubble doesent burst !! Mrs G

"Hello all
I haven't been on here in ages as I don't tend to have much time. I've been very slowly reducing my steroids without too much trouble and am now on 7.5mg a day.
On Sunday morning, we went for a 5 mile walk (haven't done a long walk in ages) and it seemed fine at the time. However, yesterday (Monday), I started feeling very tired (abnormally) and painful muscles across my upper chest and upper back (pectoral??). Would these muscles be affected by the walk??
Today, I have had to take the day off work due to the utter exhaustion I am feeling etc..
I have read on here about people feeling \""wiped out\"" by this illness, but I had not experienced this before. Do you think the exhaustion and muscle ache is to do with PMR???

"I am 56 yrs and was diagnosed with PMR 2 years ago in May. I had been complaining to my GP that I kept hurting all over, and then had areas of \""sore\"" skin. It might be the top of my back for a few days, then it would be the outside of my thigh for a week or two, then my buttock area - always moving around. I finally was referred to a consultant when I could hardly lift my leg to put my trousers on! My husband used to remove my shoes at the end of the day because I couldn't bend to reach. Getting in or out of the car was a nightmare, and I panicked badly when I was in the middle of town shopping, and suddenly felt like I could not move another step. I did get home but it frightened me. Another time I squatted down to talk to my grandson and then could not push myself back up to a standing position without help. I was not sleeping paticularly well, waking at around 2am every day and then not realy going back to sleep properly - cat-napping and experiencing extremely vivid dreams was how I spent my night! I can't say I felt particularly tired the next day though. I had my thyroid zapped and take thyroxin for about 16 years, together with 2 blood pressure medications (one of which was Amlodopine).
Anyway, the consultant did blood tests which were normal (ESR 11 from 44, some 3 months earlier), and RA was negative. I was started on 15mg prednisolone and three days later could have climbed Everest!! After 6 weeks I was brought down to 10mg and was then to reduce 1mg every 6 weeks. By 7mg the heartburn was so severe I thought I had had a heart attack! I was allowed to jump to 5mg so that I could take a coated gastro-resistant pill. Each time I reduced, I experienced some aches and pains but worst of all was emotional and tearful spells, crying on and off for 2-3 days. After a week or so, this always settled and I got over these spells. Down to 2.5mg, I asked if I could come right off, as my hair was going through phases of falling out, my eyes were uncomfortable and the night sweats were unbearable. He agreed that I try. Even at 2.5mg, at least my chubby face slimmed down and I lost a stone in weight (I actually put 2st on - mainly around the facial area and middle - I am unsure how much was also due to middle age spread, menopause and total lack of exercise?)
I think on hindsight I jumped from 2.5mg to 2mg, and then to 1mg too quickly. I alternated two days of 2mg, one day of 1mg for almost two weeks and then 1mg for two days and none for one day for only about a week, and finally stopped altogther on 24 February. Almost at the same time I suffered a viral infection with a bad chest, cough etc and had two lots of antibiotics. I expected the pain flare as usual as this had been gently ticking along all the time of reducing, but was bearable. This has gradually built now into different symptoms - while I had pain in my upper arms at diagnosis, the pain is now such that carrying a bag far is tiring; my shoulders are painful, my neck is stiff, my knees kill me at night some times, some days my wrists hurt, some days my feet, every day the muscles in my upper front thigh are so painful that I avoid sitting in a low chair as I know it will hurt to get up. My buttocks feel as though a horse has kicked me. The funny thing is, the worst symptom at diagnosis was not being able to get my foot up to put my socks/trousers on, but that is not so troublesome now. Going up or down stairs is just awful as the pain in my front thighs is so bad. Some days my fingers hurt and other days I feel burning and stabbing sensations in my buttocks and lower back. I have phases of pins and needles in my hands and arms at night, and sometimes my legs are really painful and cause me to have to \""stretch\"" (like a cat), while in bed at night - it is a strange feeling of almost a tingle all over, which then goes after stretching. Then, on another day I get up and wonder what has happened as I don't feel so bad.
I now cannot drop off to sleep and spend the night in such intense thought and dreams, it seems so many of them, so I must be cat-napping, and some dreams just so bizarre. I felt sickness on and off for weeks but this has almost stopped thank goodness. I have had numerous bouts of heartburn and take Gaviscon, as I struggle with Omeprazole. My hair is still falling but no bald patches just thinned quite a bit. I have spent the last couple of weeks feeling as though something awful will happen, I have been extremely tearful and feel continually plotting \""some plot\"". The last straw today was the cat catching a mouse - and a flood of tears for the poor little thing, and what if it had babies, etc etc! I have a fairly responsible job and have always been a good multi-tasker, but actually cannot cope with one task at work at present. I feel continually overwhelmed, and with some job changes looming don't actually know what I will do if I get asked to learn anything new! I can't remember names, forget what I am saying in the middle of a sentence and worry what everyone is thinking.
I have seen my GP, asked for an ESR to be done with my 6monthly thyroid test, and have asked what best dose of steroid I should take again. I see the consultant in late May. I have been off treatment for almost 2 months and feel as though I have put myself back two years - I think that remaining on 2.5mg may have just kept things at bay and bearable for me, and therefore have gone back onto 2.5mg starting today!! When I see the consultant I should be in a position to tell him my ESR (remember I had no problem with that at diagnosis), and will know how the steroids are affecting me after taking them again for approx one month.
Perhaps I am one of those who will need to stay on low dose for some time - all I know is, this whole thing is getting on my nerves! I don't really want to take steroids for ever more, I am fed up with this constant pain presenting somewhere different in my body all the time. I'd like to go to bed and sleep the night and get up without shuffling for the first dzen steps to loosen up.
I'll let you know what my consultant says next month, and also if I feel any better in a few days - which might just prove a point if I do.

"Have been off the drug for six weeks under supervision after GP agreed my body had had enough of steroids. Felt really ill, quite apart from the PMR pain.
In myself feel much, much better but pain is severe in the morning,only relieved by a long, hot, massage shower. Walking is slow and painful; I walk upstairs like a toddler. Gradually improve and by supper-time pain level is tolerable.
What I want to ask is has anyone experience of beating PMR without steroids. I have read that it can be self limiting in 1-4 years!!!
This is my second bout. The first responded to a starting dose 0f 30mgs tapering to nil after 3 yearsbut with all the usual side effects. Second bout started on 15 mgs but response far less successful and much worse adverse effects.

"I have recently been diagnosed with PMR. I had the first attack 5 years ago, it lased 3 months and went as quick as it started. At the time it was not diagnosed with PMR but a viral infection. 7 months ago I woke up one morning and had the familiar feeling in both my arms and shoulders, as if I had been lifting weights and the muscels were very painful and I couldn't lift my arms. After a few weeks of putting up with pain and not sleeping, I suggested to my doctor that I had researched the problems I was experiencing and thought that I had PMR, he just laughed and offered me anti-depressants and painkillers.This just about reduced me to tears. It took several months to get a referal to a Rhuematologist, he diagnosed PMR and started me on steroids. That was 2 weeks ago and the improvement is great. I have full use of both arms and less pain. A long way to go yet, blood tests this morning and then another visit to the Hospital in Alameria on 30th. I tink the most frustating issue here is that it takes so long to get a correct diagnosis. Has any one else had the same experience?

"PMR probably started after a minor fall in May 06 after which my back ached for a few days. A short time after that my upper legs became painful-getting out of bed, dressing etc, getting on my bike(pushbike).I was training for a long distance ride(110 miles)in the French Alps and was very fit riding 100/150 miles a week. I realised how serious it was when on the way to Dover I found it almost impossible to get out of the car then difficulty walking .Obviously no bike riding. On our return GP (who has been excellent) put me on Pred. with immediate effect-ESR was 55.
The steroids were reduced gradually to 12 in Sept. and by then I was riding again (fairly slowly). I did find that ESR levels did not tally with how I felt so stopped them by agreement with GP.
During 07 things remained much the same – difficult to get the steroids down but I was riding more and was able to do more long rides. Had some very bad days with steroids at about 10 and had to increase to 15 for a while towards the end of the year.
This year I have been riding regularly with steroids remaining at 10. Went to the Pyrenees in July and completed a 105 mile 1 day ride. It was very demanding esp the long mountain climbs but there were no after-effects. For the next 3 weeks we walked every day.
Since July steroids have come down to 6 and the last 4 days have been the first for ages that I have woken up without any pain.
My aim has been to exercise as much as possible and try to keep muscles strong and also avoid them wasting away.
Also it is important to carry on doing something which you really enjoy. Riding has been very painful at times esp when out riding with the Cycling Club but I always feel better after coming home , a shower and a cup of tea.
I feel that compared with so many others I have been ”lucky” to be able to do so much also have had no side effects with my weight staying constant.
I take calcium and ibandronic acid for the bones. Recently I started acupuncture but at present don’t know if it has had any benefit.
I hope that this may be of some interest
Best wishes

"I found you all earlier this month. It has been quite a breakthrough for me knowing that so many of you are coping with PMR. None of my friends have heard of PMR and I think at times they are really puzzled at how life has changed for me.
My life changed drastically three years ago, diagnosed eventually with Giant Cell Arteritis. By the time my G.P. finally prescribed 40m.g. of Prednisolone My hearing and eyesight was effected. After 48hours of Pred remarkable recovery!. It took 18 months to get down to 3m.g. then I was ill again, this time with PMR. Back up to 20 m.g.Gradually got down to 3m.g. again. Then last month terrible pain in the neck couldnt get out of bed without help,- I'm back to 15m.g. of Prednisolone. This time just to add a bit of interest I have urticaria (hives) as well. So its back to hamster cheeks and weight gain.
However what I really wanted to say is - How much It has helped me just reading of your experiences, you have know idea how comforting it has been. Month by month I'm finding ways of making life as pleasant as possible, i.e. On the days I am exhausted I dont try to fight it, I just rest, and usually feel a bit better next day.
I am going to attempt a holiday in France next month, so wish me luck, and if anyone has any advice I'll be pleased to hear it.
thinking of you all.

"I have been taking Prednisolone (20mg) for 5 days - there has been no miraculous cure yet! I probably feel 60% better but cried this morning when I couldn't get out of bed again without help and typing this hurts my upper arm.
My symptoms started completely out of the blue about 3 weeks ago and I was first treated for a viral infection, inflammation in my joints until the doctor had a Eurueka moment and the more I have discovered on the internet since I can see I definitely tick all the right boxes. I go back to him and have another blood test at the end of this week.
I am scared about several things:
Week 1 wasn't as bad & I manged to carry on at work, since then I have been on sick leave - how long before I am able to go back to to work?
I am 59 and need to carry on working as long as can, I had no thought of retiring for years - I couldn't afford to, but at the moment I can't drive and I can't use a computer for any length of time.
Will I need/be able/have to claim DLA of some kind - I have no idea where to start?
I was so pleased with myself for losing about 2 stone over the last year or so and wanted to get to my target weight by my 60th in June so I really find the prospect of puttting on weight wih the steriods upsetting. I had breast cancer treatment a few years ago so I know how awful it is.
Most of all I want to stop the pain (my daughter says would you rather be ill & slim or well & fat?) - I want so much to feel like myself again!
Sorry about the rant but all replies gratefully appreciated.

"Hi All
Do I have PMR or not, I am a 64 year old female
I stared having severe pain in my shoulders and upper arms 4 months ago it started suddenly
at first I thought it might have been spondylosis but
it gradually got worse I could not lift my arms and the pain had me feeling sick
I would wake up feeling very stiff and painful my husband had to lift up the bed clothes for me. it got so bad
I went to see my GP and after examination he said he was almost certain I had PMR but to prove it he ordered a blood test
He was shocked that it came back ok.
Because I was in so much pain he said I probably did have PMR and started me on steroids, I couldn't believe it after the second doze I was almost pain free.
I hate taking steroids and usually refuse them because I have taken them many times in the past due to MS
and I really didn't want all the side affects that go with them.
I started bringing myself down against my GPs wishes and am now on 2.5
Low and behold the pains are returning even down into my wrists.
Can anyone suggest anything
Thank You

"Hi,
My partner says I'm so positive its really quite irritating, but today I'm going to have my first PMR moan. Please switch off now if you don't want to listen. Its finally dawned on me that provided I do absolutely nothing out of the ordinary and only eat things I don't like much, then I will feel quite well. Go outside of these guidelines and thou shalt be punished. I went to France for the day on Tuesday, had a wonderful time stocking up on lovely French coffee and wine and spent the whole of Wednesday laid on the settee feeling very sorry for myself. Yesterday I took my lovely Grandson and Daughter to Thorpe Park (along with a million others!) and today? Don't ask. :yuk: I feel as though I'm outside of my body (difficult to explain but I've a notion that many of you will recognise the feeling). My brain simply won't work (had a long discussion with my Solicitor this morning over a property sale and I've no idea what he said). I went shopping to Sainsbury's and found myself in the ASDA car park. I've got very dear friends coming to supper tonight and I'd rather poke needles in my big toe. I want to cry :wah: and I'm not a crying sort of person. Solution? Have a moan on here, lay down on the settee, watch some rubbish television and probably feel better in an hour or so. Sorry everyone, it really is my first moan and tomorrow I'm sure I'll regret having opened my heart, but I know what lovely people you are and that you'll forgive me.

"Good afternoon everyone!
I hope everyone is pretty wellish in spite of the weather............!
I am just about to start the next bit of the new plan, reducing the Pred from 25mg to 20mg as from tomorrow. I did that bit fine last time, this time I am more worried as I still have considerable pain in my scalp and the left side of my head. Also, this morning I woke with a black eye on that side....it looks quite awful and I know it wasn't there last night. Think I will have to wear a paper bag tomorrow.
Just 4 more working weeks until I finally retire. Everything at home is geared up to getting me into work for those weeks and at odd times we are still clearing and packing ready for the house move. This is still scheduled for end May/early June. Spent time yesterday sorting and packing books which doesn't sound like heavy work, does it? But I was wiped out when I finished.
The permanent fatigue never helps either.........I find that I need to go upstairs for something or the other, while I'm there I look at the bed and think a 10 minute rest would be good.........and wake two hours later :oops:
In spite of everything things are improving, I was able to walk more last week than at any time since the beginning of January..........roll on Spring.

"6th April 2010
I was diagnosed with polymyagia some 8 years ago and given steroids, which worked, but with the unwanted side effects.
When I worked myself off the steroids, the symptoms returned.
This year, by chance, I heard the BBC charity appeal for sufferers of Coeliac disease, an intensive allergic reaction to gluten. One symptom was said to be tiredness to extreme lethargy.
So I experimented with a low gluten diet to see if that was the problem. The tiredness and lethargy have gone and I'm feeling very much better for that. The pain remains as ever, but that, I now know, is another matter.
My diet is not extreme, but I have largely cut out the wheats - bread, pies, pastries, cakes. I do have oat cakes and make my own gluten free bread, far better than the shops, I boast. It' a matter of degree and practicality.
I suspect the real problem has been the science of wheat etc. development has focussed on producing products that enable easy manufacture and production of foodstuffs, to the neglect of human health. That's business for you!
So, for me, polymyalgia appears to have been a polyproblem. Now I have cracked one of them.
Good luck.

"Hi Everyone,
I saw my doctor just before Christmas and she diagnosed PMR in seconds! I haven't yet had the blood test she wants but, reading through the posts, I think she is right!
I can trace things back to a severe chest infection earlier in the year.
Until my doctor uttered polymyalgia, I had never heard the word. I Googled it and found you all. Can I just say thank you to everyone who posts as I have benefited so much from your personal experiences.
As a newby, I have, of course a dozen questions. Some I have found the answers to but some I have not.
I really do not want to take steroids if I can manage without them; has anyone managed with NSAIDS?
Will PMR go without medication or is it the medication which kills it off?
Has anyone tried an anti-inflammation diet?
Does the peach fuzz disappear when the PMR disappears?
Happy New Year to all.

"How about this.
I actually took a prescription in, I (not strictly true), a friend took me for a drive and we called in to collect it just for a change.
Arrived at chemists and lo and behold, Independent gone and Boots taken over.
Handed over prescription and out came Pharmacist:
\""Good Morning Mrs so and so - have you a few minutes?\""
\""Yes\""
\""Come through here please\""
Desk, Computer, two chairs.
My prescriptions up on screen, then went through them, asking how I re-acted, what I felt, blah blah blah.
Two days later, letter arrives, list of all prescribed medicines, how long taking them, re-actions etc and a copy to my GP.
This is a yearly service I gather, but as a longterm user they automatically check the computer when a prescription is issued to ensure - Yes you guessed it - compatibility and also to alert the GP in case repeat prescriptions are being issued without awareness.
Wow.
Is this happening all over?

"I've had the symptoms of PMR since July 09 when doc put me on 30mg pred and I improved right up to Xmas when I was down to 15mg. Since then I have really gone downhill and went back to 30mg after Xmas and there has been no improvement. I finally saw consultant rheum 2 wks ago, and am now totally confused :?; he wants me to go back to 'basics' and come off steroids and look at taking anti inflammatories, which I was taking before pred with no effect. He has given me a programme of reducing the preds by 2.5mg every 2 weeks down to 7.5mg, and am now on 15mg and feeling the pain! He recommends I take diclofenic at the same time which I'm not really happy about as I have a hiatus hernia and blood pressure, and really don't want to aggravate anything else! He said steroids can cause a lot of the symptoms I'm getting, so I got the feeling he not an advocate of them.
I did have bloods taken 2wks before I saw him, but unfortunately the computer was 'playing up' :evil: the day I saw him and so he couldn't retrieve the results! so I had some more taken, but he doesn't want to see me for 2 months.

"Had PMR since last July, steroid dose now down to 15mg a day from 30mg.
The past 2 weeks I have noticed worsening muscle weakness in my left leg and foot which leaves my leg feeling slightly numb and cold, although not particularly cold to touch. In addition to this, I get 'warming' sensations in my right leg which seems to come and go, but no weakness or numbing.
I suffer with Raynauds, and had back surgery 2 yrs ago, so am not sure if this could be the cause or the pmr.
Am seeing GP next Tues, but not seeing the Rheumy for at least another 5/6 wks - if I'm lucky! - he wants me to reduce steroids fortnightly 2.5mg each time, until I get to 7.5mg. He did suggest I take anti inflammatory as well, but I have a hiatus hernia, so don't want any more pills!
Does anyone else have this problem? Any advice would be welcome.

"i have lost computer access for awhile but am back on line, but i lost all my contacts etc . slowly finding things again. i came off steroids alltogether, stoping them slowly over a period of time, then a few days later pain started in my legs and worsened and they became inflammed. i had gotten very intensive inflammation of the legs. phelbitis. the doctor suggested that fluid had been building up because of taking the steroids over a period of time, stopping the steroids made the inflamation occur. i am now on morphine for the intense pain, this has been going on for some three months now. steroids are a no no for me at this stage.mobility has worsened, and i am virtually not able to walk far at all. feel as if i have entered another dark tunnel. but keep smiling.

"[b:8d7caf11b8][color=black:8d7caf11b8][/color:8d7caf11b8]Hello Linda Ann & all others, I am another new sufferer..mid 70's & until 6 weeks ago very active & loving my busy life.PMR developed literally overnight & as I became more & more stiff & sore I couldn't under stand what was happening to me.One day a few cogs in my brain fell into place & I thought of PMR & turned to wikipedia....very helpful.It took a couple of weeks of indecisive blood tests & an unconvinced GP but I am now on 15mgms daily.Progress has seemed slow but since starting the pills I have not had a repeat of thatawful scary seizing up in the night & Ido seem to loosen up as the day goes on.It does seem to vary so much. Yesterday I had to use 2 sticks & could hardly move until midday....today not too bad.I am so lucky to have lovely friends & neighbours who are very helpful & even put my shoes & socks on if I have to admit defeat!I was worried about the bath problem so I got into the empty bath fully dressed for a trial so that if it became a 999 job I was at least decent.I did get out JUST but am sticking to showers [ which I hate] for the moment.It is a great help to read about fellow sufferers & to read good advice based on personal experience.Good luck to all of you.My best advice so far is to get a nice long \""grabber\"".It is quite amazing what one can do with them.Iloved the comment about dust. I have written it in big letters & have displayed on the kitchen shelf.A great thought.[/b:8d7caf11b8][list:8d7caf11b8][/list:u:8d7caf11b8]

"I have suffered with terrible pain from my left shoulder down my arm to my elbow sometimes extending to my hand but only at night in bed (the arm sometimes gives a burning sensation as well) - when I get up and move the pain subsides - I have no stiffness, full range of movement with no associated pain and pride myself on being 8 stone, 57 years old and still running 4 to 5 miles a week and doing very intensive Pilates work outs twice a week.
I have no other pain anywhere else and lead a very active life - although now thinking about it - I need my sleep and get very tired in the evenings.
How do I find out if I really do have PMR - I had normal blood tests before Christmas as a check up - all normal.
Should I ask my GP to refer me to a rheumatologist?
I do not like the thought of taking steroids.

"I was diagnosed with PMR about 4 1/2 years ago at age 52 after experiencing great pain for several months. When it first hit me, I thought it was a flu, and I did not go downstairs for 3 days, because I hurt so badly. At that time my sed rate was 40. I was put on a trial dose of prednisone for 2 weeks. After 4 days I felt normal. It was wonderful. My primary care provider then sent me to a rheumatologist who told me ""you're not old enough, your sed rate is not high enough, and I don't want you to take prednisone"", even after I told him that prednisone was the only thing that made me feel normal. I went home almost in tears. Our insurance changed, and I suffered for another year before I was sent to a rheumatologist. He agreed with the PMR diagnosis and put me back on prednisone. Insurance changed again, and another rheumatologist had me on the prednisone for a while (1 year total) and then switched me to hydroxychlorquine, as I had gained 36 pounds on prednisone!! That didn't seem to work as well; my sed rate was 42 when I quit that in April this year. I have yet another new rheumatologist, who is a dear, and agreed to let me stay off prednisone for a while so I could try to lose some weight. Sed rate went from 49 to now at 62. He is willing to give me a little more time to try to lose some more weight, bless his heart, but will push to restart the prednisone by November if not sooner. I will go for another blood test this month and then probably go back on prednisone then. I am tired of hurting, and 18 pounds weight loss is okay. Am hoping now that I'm on a better diet, and know how prednisone affects me, perhaps I'll be able to even lose a few more pounds. My husband is a dear, too, and says it is more important for me not to hurt than to be thin. :-) For the person who was asking what sed rate should be for someone 56, my rheumy said for the over 50 crowd to add 10 to your age and divide by 2, so sed rate for age 56 should be 33. For the person who is concerned about GCA, as long as you know what the symptoms are and are aware of it if it should happen, I wouldn't worry. They say quick treatment will prevent blindness.

"My father aged 81yrs was diagnosed with polymyalgia approx 6 months ago . I suspect he has had it for some time. Steroids have not been the miracle drug we had hoped for.At first it was stiffness to the arms and shoulders and the hip joints and very stiff in the mornings until he got moving . He has lost partial sight in one eye which i put down to the illness.He is unable to walk without a stick at the moment and is confirmed to the house.He has lost most of the feeling in his lower legs and feet and has the sensation of pins and needles. The specialist said his folic acid levels are low and this is the reason for this.I have asked about increasing his steroids (he is on 7.5mg at the moment but over the last month it has been up to 15mg) I realize there are different symptoms with this illness but have'nt heard of anyone with these symptoms and everyone else seems to swear by steroids.He can cope with the aches and pains but is getting increasingly depressed by being house bound.

"Hi,
Just back from a very good visit to the Consultant. CRP 2/ESR 2 (CRP down from 22 - ESR always low). My results reflected how much better I've been feeling since reducing to 10mg on the 1st March (previous 2 drops proved much more difficult). She's now sent me away with a programme of reduction that needs a degree in maths but makes sense to me and I hope its going to work. I'd be interested to know if anyone else has been given this programme. 1st week: 9mgs followed by 6 days at 10mgs. 2nd week: 9mgs x 2 days and 10mgs x 5 days equally spaced (I hope you're following me and haven't dropped off to sleep with boredom :zzz: ) 3rd week: 9mgs x 3 and 10mgs x 4 ditto above. By week 7 I'll be down to 9mgs all week. I then repeat the pattern to get down to 8mgs etc. etc. It will take 63 weeks or thereabouts to get off the steroids completely (if I'm lucky!) She said there may well be some blips and to listen to my body, but she also said that she's finding this quite successful and is hopeful that it will work for me. Although it will take a whole 7 weeks to reduce just 1mg I'm going to give it a go as my Consultant is very focused and seemed very excited that she had found a way of getting a good percentage of her patients off of steroids completely albeit very, very slowly. I'm now going to sit a Master's Degree in Maths to work out what I have to take and when (actually I'm just going to buy another pill dispenser and do a week's tablets at a time). The only negative was my cholesterol but that's another story and I won't bore you with it :? Keep well. Lizzie Ellen

"I've been reading about all of your experiences with PMR for several months now and have finally got up enough nerve to post mine and have learned so much from reading them.
My bout with this erratic disease began last June (2009) and I really thought at first that my age - 84, at that time, had finally caught up with me! I was used to doing all my own housework, gardening and playing 18 holes of golf twice a week. After having all the crippling symptoms for about three weeks, I went to my GP (family doctor) and he immediately ordered blood tests - suspecting what it was and as my sed rate was 74 he put me on 15 mg of prednisone, which after about three days reduced my pain and siffness by about 80%. I, not ever hearing about the diease, couldn't believe, at first, that one could feel good one day and the next, feel awful. And like a lot of you have wrote, that other people cannot believe that you are really not well- because you don't look sick, that is unless they see you tryng to get out of a car - or get out of bed - or bend over to retrieve something on the floor or out of a cupboard.
Actually, I have done quite well with just my simple regimen. I'm now on 6 mg after being on 5 mg for a month and not doing so well, will try to reduce more slowly this time. At first my Dr. had me taking Prilosec (to help with stomach discomfort) beore taking Prednisone each morning, but I soon found out that if I took the Pred while I ate a piece of toast or other food, I had no stomach discomfort whatever. I also started having a cup of yogurt (low-fat/ fruit on the bottom) every day after my noon sandwich, and I don't know whether that has helped stomach distress or?? I am lactose intolerant so chew a lact-aid pill before having any milk or cheese product.
Because I have some osteoporosis I and my Dr. are striving to get me off of Pred as soon as possible and have tried all of the new \""bone\"" medicines but with bad results (sharp bone pain) - so am sticking with Citrical Plus Bone Density Builder and Vitamin D, of course. I usually have a small glass of wine at night and don't eat many sweets. On this simple regimen I'm able to function fairly well and have continued playing golf at least once a week. I did not gain any weight and noticed some fullness in my face when on the higher dosages. I count myself very lucky when I read about all the difficulties a lot of you have had.
I have often wondered, same as you, what could have brought this on? I know that I have been on and off of different statin drugs during the last 30 years and don't like any of them. Because I have hada history of high cholesterol, my Dr. keeps trying to push them on me. In fact I had just took myself off of the last ones just before this PMR overtook me. Why I don't like to take them is because soon after my first go-round with a statin drug and my first experience with prednisone, I started losing my hair and by 1990 had lost all of it and it has never come back. I went to many specialists at that time = but of course not any of them could or would say if it was a drug that caused it. Also, ever since I had my first child at 18 years of age, I have had Hypothyroidism and have had to take thyroid med in some form or another ever since then.
Also, about 2 1/2 years ago, after a bout of pneumonia I was diagnosed with a small carcinoid tumor in my left lung. I keep having CT scans every six months and so far it hasn't grown, so drs. don't want to take it out. (I think they believe I'm too old!)
Outside of this I've had a pretty healthy life on the whole and thankful for every day.
I just pray and hope that someday medical science will find what brings on this disease - as is the hope, I'm sure, of all cancer, diabetes, arthritis, fibromalgia, ms and all the other terrible disease patients.
Sorry this is so long, and will try to keep all future communications simpler.

the doctor is reluctant to put me back onto steroids because of the phelbitis and fluid retention problem.

"A couple of weeks ago I was asked this question via our website
[b:b8b60d6683]\""My query is based on the fact that one of the ways of using corticosteroids in other chronic conditions is to use double the daily dose but taken on alternate days - hence the name alternate day therapy. It is believed to mimic the diurnal variation of cortisol production in the body better and is associated with fewer longterm side-effects. I had gathered from the website that you are all non-medical people but I wondered if your nice consultant had ever said anything about it.\""[/b:b8b60d6683]
I asked my excellent Rheumy ( I do not know how I would have got through all of this without my two brilliant GPs and two Excellent Consultant Rheumatogolists) and this was the response'
[b:b8b60d6683][i:b8b60d6683]\""Yes, I often tell patients to take alternate days as the suppressing effect on the adrenal glands is minimal. I usually do this only when the dose is below 10mg prednisolone. If any one needs higher doses, whatever the advantages in terms of side-effects, the PMR or GCA often needs the steroids daily\"".[/i:b8b60d6683]
[/b:b8b60d6683]
[i:b8b60d6683]Please note 10mg prednisolone is the key[/i:b8b60d6683]
This information could be of some use when trying to get down and not having to cut the tablets in half or use the non-entric coated 1mg.
But remember, never do anything without consulting either your GP or Rheumatologist. We are all different in someways.

"This is my third attempt at reducing my Pred to below 5mg. I visited my doctor last week and she was surprised that I was in so much pain when my ESR was down to 5, and said that I should try to reduce again slowly. I was a bit reluctant to do this as I was worried about the pain getting even worse and having to go back up to a high dose again to fix it. She said try Etoricoxib (90mg) and see if that helps, while you gradually reduce the Pred. Well, the effect was quite dramatic, almost like taking Pred for the first time. Within 24 hours I was almost pain free!
I am now on the 5th day of Etoricoxib and have just started alternating between 5mg and 4mg of the Pred. On the second day I had quite bad stomach pains, not in the usual place for me but lower down, more like the bowel so, on the third day I cut the tablets in half (45mg) and they were still quite effective on the PMR and the stomach pains were much reduced. I think I will now try a few days off them and see how I get on then maybe take one when I am having a bad day or when I need to have a good day because of other commitments.

Apart from the stiff neck feeling painful when driving and sometimes in the evening (and trying to turn over in bed) I had no pain or aching and no tiredness etc..
My GP diagnosed PMR and put me on 20mg, to which I had a very quick response. I'm now on 10 mg.

Although I only noticed them a few days ago, as they're halfway up my nails (most prominent on my thumb nails) they must have been there a while. So my query is - why did she ask me and has anyone else got/had them? I'm seeing her on the 17th March but as you all have so much information to offer on this site I thought I would ask here first.

"Hi there, I was diagnosed with pmr last August after several exrays and blood tests since last June. I like everyone else just woke one morning and couldn't turn over in bed, brush my hair, put pants on etc due to excruciating pain in shoulders and groin. I left it a couple of weeks before I went to the doctors as we had just come back from Turkey and done alot of walking and thought it was that. The doctor started me off on 15mg of Prednisolone as I am insulin dependent diabetic and have cardiomyopathy. The steroids made my sugar levels go up and my heart specialist wasn't happy that I was on steroids. My doctor put my dosage down to 10mg in December but the pain came back . She then referred me to a Rheumotologist in February and he put me back on 10mg one day and 12 the next. I am still quite stiff first thing in the morning but nowhere near as bad as last year. The Rheumotologist suggested that I go on to Azathioprine instead of Prednisolone and I have today been for a blood test. He says it will take about 8-10 weeks to work but not effect my sugar levels. After reading the side effects, I am quite concerned with regards to this drug. I know all medicines have side effects but wondered if anyone else has been on Azathhioprine. I look at this site on a daily basis and find it very good. By the way I am 61 years of age.

"First thing I want to say is that since I discovered this website a few months ago I have felt so much better knowing that we PMR sufferers have a way of communicating what this illness is really about. Conrad's idea of a support/self help group is great, because, as someone else has written, PMR isn't a 'cool' illness - it doesn't attract much research interest or ££.
Now why might that be?
a) Doctors are encouraged to think PMR is associated with ageing - therefore, something that's just bad luck that you have to live with, and hey, it's not life-threatening.
b) Steroids at a high dose give such immediate relief that doctors can be forgiven for writing the prescription and hoping the problem will go away.
c) (important I think, but my conjecture) It doesn't appear on a great many sick notes. Either people with PMR are already retired, or they use medication to avoid having to take time off work. It's hard to explain an illness that most people haven't heard of so PMR sufferers who go out to work just cover up their symptoms as best they can and make jokes in the office about getting old. Therefore, it's not seen as a great cost to the economy and therefore nobody with ££ is all that interested.
I've had PMR for nearly two years but was only referred to the rheumatologist at the hospital a year ago because of mysterious back pain. Since then I have had my dosage reduced, \""so that they could see what was going on\"" raised again, then reduced again. The hospital doctor now says he wants me off the steroids but didn't give me a clear reason. I want to be off them too but the only alternative the doctor can offer is to take co-codamol and my GP is concerned that I will get addicted to codeine. Seems like we are between a rock and a hard place as far as conventional medicine is concerned.
In the last couple of months I've been getting a new kind of pain, an excruciating acute pain in my hip and my neck, and a tenderness in my ribs so that sneezing is agony. Last week I picked up a new prescription for prednisolone and I noticed that there is some new information: \""If you have been taking this medication for a long time you may experience pain in the (guess what) hips, ribs, neck.....and so on\"".
So now I'm thinking that the drug we take for our pain could actually be hurting us - literally.
Sorry the tone of this posting sounds a bit negative but I don't mean to be. It's more a kind of defiance - we need to have a united front against this condition. Some of the postings on this site are wonderful - Pammy and Jayne are inspirational and I am definitely going to give Devil's Claw a go. If anybody knows of any dietary information about PMR it would be really interesting to share.
Regards to everybody and keep optimistic!

Sorry they said, we won't cover you for that at all - goodbye! When it came up for renewal recently I was anxious to get good cover as we intend to travel further afield later this year.

"Hello everyone
I have just been discharged which did somewhat surprise me as I am still taking steroids albeit only 2mgs.
Rheumatologist said that as my ESR is normal at 19 (normal range is 1-20) and my CRP normal at 7 (normal 0-10), I could now manage the rest on my own.
Still have some pain in my upper arms so he told me I could either increase back up slightly or ride it out and stay on 2 for another 2 months which will make 4-5 months in all on that dose since starting the reduction from 3. He seemed keen that I should try the latter.
My previous 2 ESR readings have been 8 and 11, so there is an increase and I guess I will have to just wait and see....and hope!. I mentioned my weakened arm muscles which he confirmed was a side effect of the steroids and advised me to take up Pilates.
Just thought you'd all like to hear that there does appear to be some light at the end of the tunnel.
My excitement at possibly coming off steroids soon has unfortunately been tempered by hearing that my kidney function has further decreased, but I guess that's for another forum!
Best wishes to you all and wrap up really warm against this freezing wind.

"Hi all
Having told my GP last week in no uncertain terms that I wasn't a hypochondriac with a bit of an ache and an overactive imagination, I had an urgent appointment with the rheumatologist yesterday. She is pretty certain that it is PMR, because I have classic symptoms, but said she couldn't be 100% certain because this complaint is so difficult to diagnose and my blood levels aren't raised. She also said this makes it much harder to get the steroid dose right so has given me a high dose steroid injection in my backside instead but I am not really sure why. This apparently lasts 3 months after which she will reassess the situation.
I had the injection 11am yesterday and the early signs are really encouraging as the aches and pains seem to be reducing by the hour so I am keeping my fingers crossed the improvement continues.
A lot of our discussion centred on whether I experienced stiffness first thing in the morning, which as we all know is a classic PMR symptom, (especially getting out of bed) to which my reply was that I have difficulty turning over in bed and moving because my muscles are extremely painful but she seemed to think that this wasn't the same as stiffness. Can anyone enlighten me on whether there is a difference between pain and stiffness and if so which gives you problems getting out of bed in the morning?
I am pleased to say that my depression :cry: of last week has now lifted and I am feeling much more positive so many thanks for all your support.

So I am back on track after last months upper 20s results but it has taken 15mg to sort it out I have been a bit tired after overdoing it a bit at the weekend so my Dr said to make sure I feel fine for a week before reducing to 12.5 My BP was slightly higher than it normally is but I think I was a bit stressed about these results and it was still in normal range I did ask about Gym referrals and she is happy to give me one but I am first going to try somewhere very near to me which was a cottage Hospital and now is part private part NHS and seems to do fitness for cardiac patients and other illnesses so I hope someone might me able to understand my muscles there as I was getting too many strains with ordinary Aerobics I have spent all of Jan and Feb sat keeping warm and dry so now want to get going !! Best wishes to all and I hope Green Granny your appointment goes well Mrs G

One indicator of inflammation two years ago and again now was an elevated ANA or antinuclear antibody test. My doctor wondered if this indicated lupus.
The rheumatologist agreed this is one indicator but ruled out lupus as it is only 1 of 11 criteria of which you must have at least 4.
Rheumatologist has recommended 2000 IU of Vitamin D and physiotherapy :D. I am very happy about the latter as I think it will help - when I get feeling a little better. My health insurance covers 80% which means about $20.00 a session.
The good news is since being on 20 mg steroid, the severe pain and stiffness I have had for two months, from my right hip to my ankle and mainly the calf - have disappeared! It was very painful to move in bed, get out of bed, get dressed and to walk. The 10 mg steroid and tylenol arthritis helped for part of the day but it was always bad in the morning and at night and unpredictable.

I seemed to have slumped to my knees and think my fall was broken because I was holding onto the edge of the sink and came to about half way down (or so it seemed). I ended up with a fat lip and a sore back. My lower back has been terribly sore and I wondered if I had cracked a bone. Had an xray which didn't show anything broken. I guess it is muscle strain. After almost 3 weeks, I am starting to be able to walk around with some comfort.
My doctor agreed the pills were too big (I took them in to show her) and changed the prescription to one the pharmacist mentioned to me which is similar, and much smaller.

"To all those who remember me, hi! To all those newer ones also a big Hi!
I was posting on a regular basis until 6 or so months ago when I had a huge blip which put a lot of my then diagnoses under queries. However I am now back with confirmed diagnoses of PMR. GCA and Polyarthritis and I hope to continue posting regularly.
I am currently on 25mg Pred which I need to reduce as quickly as possible (I have osteoporosis and steroid induced diabetes) which in itself is causing me considerable problems, but you know what PMR is like - we WILL overcome!
I'm also taking methotrexate and by next week will be taking the maximum dose of 25mg weekly. Because I cannot tell how I would have been had I[i:3b990cb817] not[/i:3b990cb817] been taking it, all I can say is that I have the distinct impression that it is helping me a great deal, more so with the other inflammatory arthritis with which I have been diagnosed.
I have had to pick myself up and dust myself down considerably over the last few months, which is the reason I stopped posting.....negative and whiny posts from someone with problems other than PMR/GCA would not have helped anyone one little bit! Having lost all the weight associated with high doses of Pred and then putting it all back on again made me very, very depressed at one point. That is little good to anyone else.
I feel now that I am back on the right pathway and while there may be difficult days ahead for me, at least I now know WHAT I am battling.
I'm also hoping to be there on the 11th March..........I am so looking forward to it and to meeting all those who make it there.

"I'm doing a 'Victor Meldrew'! :evil: Went for my first appointment at the hospital today, spent 3 hours there, only to be told by the Doctor, he wasn't the right one to see :twisted: Apparently in December my doctor initially referred me to endincronology, but they in turn referred me onto Rheumatology, BUT the paperwork didn't reach Rheumy, so hence I ended up seeing the endincronolist. He was most apologetic but it didn't do my stress levels any good whatsoever :?
Initially my first appt was beginning Jan after an 8 week wait, but I couldn't go because of the snow, then another appt came for 3 weeks after, but then that got cancelled by the hospital and it became a 5 week wait. I am so CROSS :bleep:
Anyway the Endincronologist is trying to get me an urgent (ha ha!) appt with the Rheumy and in the meantime is arranging for me to have a brain scan (another ha ha - doubt whether they'll find much there!) as I get a lot of bad headaches which has been confirmed as not being GCA. Also had lot of blood taken so will be interesting to see what results they show.
Am going to pay my GP a visit in the morning to see if he can hurry an appt along. :sorry:
I'm so glad there's is this usergroup I can 'sound off' to' I feel much better for it!! :hug:
Interesting reading about chillblains, I am suffering too with my leg foot, mine don't itch at all, just feels very sore and tender. I have suffered since a child with Raynauds, but have always put it down to using a electric blanket. I have now taken to wearing bedsocks instead - very glam!! :diva:
Still hoping to make it on the 11th!

"Hello friends
Well, we've all been complaining about the freezing weather and now I've got something to prove that I'm not imagining it - chillblains......ouch! and, no, I haven't even been skiing :ski: At least that's what the Nurse Practitioner thinks I've got and has given me some Capsaicin cream, so I'm virtually rubbing chilli pepper on my toes!!!
I thought this was something that our grandparents had years ago from sitting too close to the fire but we have stone kitchen and conservatory floors and a friend has just told us that when he went to his GP with the same problem last year, he was told that they are seeing a lot more of this now mainly because of the increase in stone flooring! So I've just ordered some sheepskin clogs with thick soles which have cost a fortune but I suppose that's cheaper than digging up the floor and putting heating underneath! :lol:
Hope the lull in posts on the forum mean that you're all keeping warm and relatively pain-free.

"Glad to see some of you ladies are on the way down.
I have just spoken to my GP about recent blood test and my results are also down. So she has brought me down to 15mg.
I feel great now apart from a couple of side effects.
Can PMR be this short? Just 2 and a 1/2 months so far or am I being optimistic?

"Well here I am back at 5mg again (for the second time) and just had the results of my blood test, ESR of 5, (although it doesn’t feel much like it on some days!) so my doctor says I can very cautiously start to reduce again.
Since I have been reducing from below 10mg I have been using the method of 2 days on the current dose and one day on the lower one for about 10 days, then current and low on alternate days for about 10 days, then one current and two lower for 10 days so it takes about a month to reduce fully to the next dose. This seems to work well for me so far, but it was below the 5mg that I ran into trouble last time.
I am keeping up the Nordic Walking and can still manage 3 miles on a good day, but can sometimes struggle with about 1 mile on a bad one but I always try to do some, I think that exercise is very important when on steroids.
I have been keeping a log of my progress (or lack of it!). At the end of each day I record the dose of Pred along with an estimate of the PMR pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being at the level just before started the steroids, and 1 being pain free. This is quite difficult to estimate as the pain moves around, so I take 4 readings, shoulders (always the worst), neck, arms and legs, and then take an average of all 4 readings. The data is all plotted on a graph using and XL spreadsheet. I did try to attach a copy to this posting in jpeg format but is was so small it was meaningless, but if any other members are interested they can send me a message and I will e-mail it to them. Also if anyone has kept any similar data themselves I would be most interested to compare notes.

"My doctor diagnosed me with PMR last July and I've been bouncing back and forth from 30mg to 15 mg Pred, presently on 25mg, but still in a lot of pain.
I've been reading about Fibromalgia which seems to have very similar symptoms to PMR, the majority of which seem to match the pain I suffer.
It would appear that steroids are not the answer for Fibromalgia, so am wondering how many people are actually diagnosed incorrectly.
I have my first rheumy appt a week on Monday, so of course will be asking the questions! but would appreciate hearing people's thoughts.
Been snowing here in Maidstone today, with I believe a lot more to come over the next few days - can't wait, I don't think!! :snowball:

"Just come home from my monthly maintenance visit to my treasured chiropractor (it was she who diagnosed my PMR before I even got to see a doctor) and while she was working on my wreck of a body, I asked her to try to explain to me the difference (if any) between pain and stiffness.
She explained to me that now I am being treated with steroids (just got down to 9mg from 15mg in 6 months) that my muscles are not inflamed as they would be as a result of physical trauma but the muscles and joints are all extremely stiff as a result of the condition, and it is that stiffness which is causing the pain.
She added that in the case of pain caused by inflammation, ice packs would be recommended to help reduce the inflammation and thus relieve the associated pain. But in the case of PMR, where the pain is the result of stiff muscles and joints, the application of cold packs would cause the muscles and joint to become even stiffer. For PMR, the application of heat in the form of a heated wheat bag or similar will bring relief by easing the stiffness and thus the pain. That checks out, as when my pain is really bad and pain killers are not being very effective, my much used microwaveable Beddy Bear is very comforting.

"I met someone yesterday, in her early 60s who has had PMR for 6 years BUT she has never had any side effects from steroids - her Dr says about 10% of patients don't get any. I have known her on and off for a long time and she has always seemed incredibly fit and energetic, had a job in Social Services, cycled, walked, gardened, looked after house, garden and grandchildren. This is still so, but she has never managed to get below 6 mg. pred. It seems that she has NO PAIN or STIFFNESS as long as she keeps up the dose. She is happy to stay on steroids for ever really! Her Dr. does try and get her to reduce. But I suppose it is patients like her who sometimes give the impression that PMR is a very minor affair and what are we all moaning about. But for her it has been a balancing act; no pain or lack of energy versus staying on steroids which apparently don't have any side effects for her. I wonder in the long run though! Don't know whether to be envious or not!

"Hello Everyone
I do hope you can help. I'm writing on behalf of a friend with PMR (and possibly the giant cell condition) who was taken off steroids after 18 months, only to have his symptoms reappear as bad as ever. When he asked to be re-started on steroids, a GP in the practice wanted to prescribe only 1mg daily, and he had to fight to get 3mg. He asked about referrals to a specialist, but was told that, because it was such a common condition, people were not referred to a consultant. After reading more on the internet, and visiting this site, we now know that he was mis-informed.
He lives in the Lancaster/ Kendal area, but is prepared to travel for an appointment with a good Rheumatology Consultant - does anyone have any experience of hospitals and consultants in the NW of England?

"Hi all ~
I cannot believe I am only now stumbling upon this site! I have been surfing the net for so long! I hope someone can shed some light for me!
Let me begin by saying that I am not the one with PMR - it is my 75yo mother. She is always amazed at what I can find out on the internet!
Mom was diagnosed with PMR after falling down the stairs about 6 years ago and breaking her leg very badly. They determined that she hadn't actually broken her leg when she fell but rather her boned literaly cracked and that caused her to fall! She was diagnosed with Osteoporosis and then with PMR.
It took the doctors a long time to get it under control because it is rare and we live on PEI, Canada...a very small population. There is only 1 other lady on the Island with PMR.
She has been very lucky over the past 6 years - only one scary moment when she began having double vision and we were scared she would lose her sight. However, they were able to get that rectified.
Here's where it gets confusing. On January 15th, my mom was with me and my kids shopping at the local mall. She suddenly began getting this itchy feeling around her waist. She assumed it would go away and that perhaps it was something she ate. The rash didn't didn't go away but rather continued to get worse. She was having trouble sleeping at night as well. She saw a doctor who prescribed her an allergy medication and checked her Sed rate...it was 17. The next day she woke up with a swollen hand that was paining. By 5:00 that day, both her hands were swollen and extremely painful and she was also experiencing pain in her legs neck and back. She went to Emergency where they ran some tests. They said her Seds count was 29. They told her it was her PMR flaring up. They increased her Prednisone to 30mg/day, gave her a Cortisone shot and somoe Gravol to help her sleep.
Through the night, the welts continued to increase - very itchy and sore. The swelling that had subsided came back again the next day.
By Sunday morning, she could not handle the itching anymore and the pain was not getting any better in hips and shoulders. She went back to Emergency. A different doctor thought perhaps it wasn't a PMR flare up but rather just a bad allergy attack (she has no allergies that she knows of). He did tell her to increase Prednisone from 30mg to 60mg/day for 5 days then to cut back. He prescribed something for inflammation and a cream for her itch.
I saw her last night - Monday - her joint pain seems better but her itch is still there - not bad after putting her cream on it but when that wears off, its back. Her hands are still a bit puffy and tender.
So that's her story! Sorry for it being so long but I wanted to include everything! She is just so confused now because she doesnt' know if this is a PMR flare up or an allergy thing??
Have any of you ever heard of these things being symptoms of PMR? She is concerned that if this isn't the PMR, that she shouldn't be taking such high doses of Prednisone. She's also heard from another doctor that her count of 28 that she had on the 22nd is not considered high...but falls into the normal range. I have tried to find out what 'normal' is but seem to be getting conflicting numbers....could you please tell me your thoughts on this? What do your numbers run? What do you consider normal or abnormal?
Sometimes I find that I can find out more information (and more valuable ) by talking to people who experience the same thing as opposed to reading medical sites that just seem to repeat each other but don't answer specific questions! Unfortunately my mother's family doctor is not what i would consider well-informed of this disease. She has not seen a specialist since her diagnosis either - is that something that should be happening?
Sorry for all the questions! I am just trying to find some answers for my mom! Thank you all in advance!
Cheers,
Donna

I haven't been since early July when the 'concrete overcoat' took over my life and getting our of bed was a workout in itself :x As I had suspended my membership they have kindly given me a 5 day pass so I can see if I am ready to return. The gym manager has looked up PMR and is going to come up with a suitable programme for me to start back on (I was quite impressed with his concern and interest). Has anyone else returned to the gym or some regular activity after 6 months battling with PMR and if so, how did it go and any advice? I'd also like to return to swimming. I've managed to maintain my daily walk but would like to go a bit further with my (hopeful) return to fitness.

"Hello everyone,
I am a newcomer to PMR having reached 60 and felt in reasonably good health suddenly feeling dreadful and crying with pain in shoulders and hips - could hardly walk and on getting out of bed in a morning it was excruciating. I'm glad I found this site and can look at what everyone else is experiencing and interesting to see that the weather could affect the aches & pains. I am on 5 mg of Prednisolne x 3 times a day and it is helping - although I'm not happy at having to take Steroids it seems I/WE do not have a choice.
I started going to the gym approx. 12 months ago going on rower/cross-trainer/bike and was wondering if this could have brought it on - any thoughts on this anyone ? Regards, Susie :? :?

"Having been ill since last May I finally saw the Rheumatologist on 4th Dec. He said he felt I had an unusual (non text book) from of PMR in as much as it affected my shoulder/arms as normal but instead of my thighs I have terrrible pain in my lower legs. He did some further blood tests and gave me a Steroid injection. Within days the relief from the pain was amazing! I still felt tired and my leg muscles were still very weak but I could live with that. I have very bad flushes all the time and also night sweats but GP said we will look at that soon! Due to Christmas/New Year, I had to wait until 7th Jan for the Rheumatologist's report and test results to reach my GP but on that day I was started on 15mg a day Prednisolone. I was elated to finally have a diagnosis and was looking forward to getting my life back and trying to get back to work starting with rehab hours.
However! On 1st Jan, I contracted Flu and was still recovering from this when I started the Prenisolone. Within less than a week, I am feeling awful. Terrible taste in my mouth, slight facial swelling, sore throat, very dry mouth, difficulty focusing my eyes, shaky arms and legs and terrible pain in the middle of my shoulders and down both arms. Also diarrhoea once a day usually in the morning a couple of hours after taking the steroids. I have been to the GP twice and have seen two different doctors and they both say they don't think it's the Steroids which are causing the problem but that they think I have a virus and just to keep an eye on it for the next few days. Last night I hardly slept. The sweating was much worse than normal and I was still clock watching at 4.30am. This morning I am still feeling rotten.
I really don't know where to turn now and wondered if anyone else has had any problems like these? I did read in the leaflet with the steroids that you shouldn't start taking them when you have a cold or infection but would have thought my GP would have thought of this.
I am losing faith in my GP as I initially went to him with severe nosebleeds and nothing else, was put on statins and beta blockers with suspected Angina, woke up a day later in agony with all the PMR symptoms which were put down to a reaction to the statins. I was taken off the statins and nothing changed. The beta blockers were then blamed and were chopped and changed to no effect. I was then given an Angiogram which proved I didn't have Angina and was taken off all meds. Again nothing changed. Eventually I was referred to the Rheumatologist and diagnosed with PMR. I have been unable to work or even go to the supermarket since last May, until I had the steroid injection which gave me some life back. I am at my wits end having expected to continue feeling better but now this.
I am really sorry for the length of this post but just don't know what to do and am desperate. Thank you for reading this.

All seemed to start in that snowy weather I felt really bad this morning and actually instead of the normal mental block I have with increasing them I couldnt wait to have some breakfast and get the steroids down !! Perhaps did a bit too much yesterday but any little extra seems too much at present I decided that inflamation couldnt be good for my body and I would be better with the higher dose My Doctor thought it would be the case of 15mg I am now hoping I dont have to go back to 20 mg where I started but if I do I do as I dont want to spend my time just sitting around Resting !! They dont appear to have kicked in yet but fingers crossed this will work I was talking to Pam at PMR fighters Northeast and Im not the only one I know who hates to increase them it always seems a backward step but I must keep telling myself that I could have worse things ( it doesent feel like that sometimes !!)

"Hi All
As a newbie it has struck me how fit many of us were before PMR struck us down and I would be interested to know if others think there could be a link between fitness and PMR? I would have put myself in the top 1-2% for fitness in my age range before being struck down with this complaint 4 months ago and from reading the messages it seems a lot of others on this site were similarly active before PMR.
Could we have been pushing our old bodies too much and that somehow left us vulnerable.

"Hi all, poking around on the computer late at night and found a site which might be of help to people new to this pmr malarkey. Specially if you're awaiting diagnosis or your doctor is dithering.... Tills, Bob maybe?
Google 'yourtotalhealth' and it'll come up as the main site, go into the A-Z and find polymyalgia rheumatica. Click on that, then click again on fibromyalgia and pain disorders. Once you're at that page you click again on poly rheu.. (under the blue heading Health Guides) and you've got seven pages of what I thought was really helpful information. Including 'questions to ask your doctor' (but not [i:ded3007980]Why Me[/i:ded3007980]!!!)

"What a joy to find this website. To find other people struggling with this strange disease. I have been suffering for nearly 2 months with what I thought was thigh strain. After hip x-rays (no probs) my GP suddenly jumped on to PMR as a possibility after I said I also had great pain in my shoulder, which I knew was impingement and am booked in for injection.
At least that was good news, I was sent for a blood test which came back with several indicators for PMR. I was started on 20Mg of steroids which has had a slow start and took over a week before I felt any benefit but I have now had 2 days of almost no aches or pains. No more painkillers!
Am I being premature in my joy? It seems to me from reading your comments that this is a very unpredictable problem. Can I expect a reasonably fast recovery or could it drag on for ages.
This seems to me to be a little known disease and I never thought I could be in such agony and suffer so much sleep loss.
Thank you for your comments; I have drawn a lot of strength from reading them.

"Hi
Thank you to everyone that replied to my last posting on 30th November, especially Lizzie Ellen who's offer of a hug has kept me going. This website is just a fantastic release to discuss those things no one understands and it seems we are all the same here. It doesn't matter how old we are just that we are struggling at times and for me personally none of my friends have any ill health and I think they feel I'm swinging the lead !!!!
There's very little I don't do it just seems that aspect of trying to clean the bathroom and that circular motion just cripples me the next day.
I am pleased to say I've been to the opthalmologist after all your help and replies and did push to get to see him to check my eyes and all seems okay - although I left the hospital in tears as the guy that `dealt' with me who was in fact the consultant was so rude and dissmissive of me at 44 with suspected PMR that he pretty much said I was wasting his time. I felt so bad for those around me who were at least 30 years older than me in their 70's who were treated so badly by him, to be honest my dogs are treated better, I felt embarressed to be a human being at that time. yet no one addresses this behaviour in a consultant.
So I swallowed the embarressment and had a nice cry whilst walking
through the park back to my car to drive into work.
And so on we go - has anyone found that a good holiday in the sun helps? I can't afford it but will do my best if it will help me - I am just worried I feel even worse when I come home. What do you all think?
Thank you gain to everyone for your help, I'm still waiting to see the doctor to get referred to rheumatologist. Carol x

"8) Just back from eleven days in Spain. I think all those with PMR should be given at least 2 prescriptions a year to spend a few days in the sun! Apart from one very bad day (wearing a concrete overcoat is my description for it :cry: ) and two medium bad days, the rest of the holiday I felt better than I have done for months. The weather was the best I've ever experienced in November and I've been going regularly since 1984. The sun and the warmth were very, very beneficial and I just wish that I could whisk you all away for a few days R&R :!: I didn't even find the travelling too tiring although I did make sure that I didn't overdo it the day before or after to give me a fighting chance. As an aside, I had the normal and swine flu jabs just before going away (on the insistence of my Consultant, swine flu is wide spread in Spain just now) and didn't have any side effects apart from a sore arm for a couple of days. I have to have a second one on Friday. I hope everyone is feeling as well as possible - I now have to catch up on Christmas shopping, might be a lot of vouchers this year.

"Hi Everybody
I started with a pain in my upper arm spreading down to my hand, the other arm came out in sympathy soon after. After a visit to the Bridlington out of hours clinic and a blood test I was diagnosed with the dreaded PMR. Prior to that I was on Diclofenic for arthritis in the thumbs, Statins for cholesterol, Ramipril for high blood pressure and aspirin to thin the blood. After being diagnosed I was prescribed Prednisolone steroid tablets at 5mg three times a day. I haven't really noticed any improvement and have had very painful hands/fingers and recently a pain just below the knee. My only respite that I feel does any good is to take a Diclofenic to relieve the pains which they do. I appreciate that certain mixes of tablets are a no no but, if they help relieve the pain, is that so bad !! I haven't got the blood test results but, I gather, they were a little elevated. I was told that Steroids were the wonder drug and results were almost instant - not in my case. Do I need a stronger dose ?? I am very concerned about my ability to carry on my job as getting dressed alone is a very painful experience and, being 62, getting another job will be nigh on impossible. Any ideas anybody ??

"Hi All
This is a really great site and has a lot of useful stuff for a newbie like me so many thanks to all the contributors and fellow sufferers.
I have lots of question I want answers to but the main one is have I got PMR? because my consultant and GP seem to disagree on the diagnosis or the treatment and I am feeling like piggy in the middle right now. I have outlined the progress of my complaint below and would be very interested in hearing how these fit the experience of others.
Background. I am 62 years old, been fit and active all my life and up to 4 months ago regularly ran 10 miles, went to the gym, played competitive bowls etc. At end July/Aug 09 I developed a severe chest infection and cough that lasted for most of August and September. In mid Sept the first signs of my current complaint started with a strained feeling in the inside of my left leg from the hip joint to the knee. This was so painful that I couldn't lift my leg off the floor and sleep was difficult. I hobbled around for a bit and then a week or so later my right leg started to play up and both legs felt as though I had just run a marathon. I saw my GP who said it was muscular and put me on a course of Ibuprufen. A week or so later my right shoulder started to hurt really bad and then another week later my left shoulder. The most recent development is my right wrist and hand which are so painful in the morning that I struggle to butter a slice of toast. I ache all day but nighttimes are especially bad and the aches and pains in my shoulders/arms and hands keep me awake. My legs though are still achy but much improved and whilst I still can't run I can walk 2 or 3 miles without too much problem which I don't understand given the state of the rest of me. In the morning especially I am like an old man and so weak I would loose in a fight with my 18 month old grandson.
My GP and consultant disagree with the diagnosis because my blood tests do not confirm it and my GP took me off the 15mg dose of steroids the consultant prescribed after a couple of weeks even though I was much improved. The past 3 weeks, since I stopped taking the steroids, have been really bad and my quality of life just above zero so I am seeing my GP later this week to sort it out because I can't go on like this.
Apologies for rambling on like this but any advice would be most welcomed.
Many thanks
Bob

"My Mother, who is in her seventies has had this condition for a year and a half now and her doctors (three at her surgery) have been less than helpful and could not even diagnose what she had, although in extreme pain, until I wrote to them and 'told them' what I thought she had. I have had no medical training but the symptoms seemed obvious to me as this is not a 'rare' illness. During her illness she has not been treated at all well and she has not even been called in for blood tests for over 9 months, she just gets a repeat prescription at her chemists each week. That is only because I insisted on this and negotiated with both the chemist and the Doctor because of my concern that she was forgetting to take the tablets. And that is my main concern. Since this illness, but before its diagnosis, I was slightly worried about her memory. Since diagnosis I am now extremely worried. The doctors keep 'fobbing me off' and are not taking it seriously and say 'it's probably the medication' but is this normal, everyone else I know with this illness has not had this.

"Hi everyone,
I had a\""heart episode\"" in October and ended up in hospital for 8 days. My blood test showed troponin ( Ithink thats the correct spelling ), but ECG showed no abnormalities and the angiogram showed pristine arteries (their words not mine ). The specialist insisted that I had had a heart attack and am now on various medications for life. I looked extremely healthy throughout . I was initially taken to hospital because of chest and arm pains, which along with hip, back neck and shoulder pains I had had since the Spring in varying degrees in varying palces. This I put down to old age, but the day before I was sent to hospital my hips were excruciating and I felt as if the bones had splintered.
Since all this , within a week of coming out of hospital, my GP did a further blood test and diagnosed PMR. Steroids have worked really well, but now I am wondering if it was a heart attack or something triggered by the PMR. Has anyone had or heard of it affecting the heart ! Sorry this is so long, - what a great site this is, its helped me with the steroids and how to cope

"I have now been suffering from PMR for nearly 4 years and have found this site really helpful over the last few months ( only just discovered it). Having moved from 20mg to 5mg over the period I am now at the stage of thinking I may have to increase the dosage. I have struggled on 5mg for the last 6 months but find it increasingly difficult to put up with the discomfort/pain and lack of energy. I was thinking of doing 5/7.5mg on alternate daysfor a week and see how that works or, just giving a couple of days boost at 10mg to see how that works. Has anyone tried this?From being mainly in my hip and lower back area it now seems to have swung round to my upper body and upper arms.Everyone says I look better because the weight has started to go from my face! Like everyone else I have good days and bad but I really dont notice any difference from the weather. Last week at the height of the snow I had one of my best days for 2 years.

pain levels have increased, head pain, face pain, and all over body pain, very lethargic. the reduction is to test if i have actually got giant cell, and or poliymigia or not. gp says yes, cocnsultant is unsure as i have underlying medical conditions that could be masking it. the steroids have certianly helped a lot, so maybe i will be put back on them, people say i look better than i did, but i dont feel good. margaret e.

"As I mentioned in a previous post I've just started to reduce my Prednisolone for the first time, as of 1st January. I'm going from 15mg to 12.5mg for a month and see how it goes, then hopefully down to 11mg for a month and then 10mg. At this point I go back to see the Consultant and see how my bloods are doing etc. As I've read about the problems lots of you have had reducing the medication, even by just 1mg or 2mg sometimes, I was wondering what side effects I could expect and at what point you've had to throw in the towel and go back up a mg or two. I'm fine at the moment but it is only the 4th so wouldn't expect to be feeling the effects yet. I'd really like to start reducing and have left myself a reasonably quiet few weeks to give it a chance but any advice would be really appreciated.

"I've had PMR for 1 1/2 yrs. I got it the same time I was diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff in my shoulder. I was finally able to get the dose of prednisone down to 9.5 mg./day, by going very slowly. Then I fell against my sofa and tore the other rotator cuff. I had to go back to 15 (sometimes 20) mg.of prednisone/day to control symptoms. I also got my ""sick all over"" feelings back, just like I'd had at first. I am extremely tired all the time, and need a nap daily. I've fallen about 6 times; had to get 4-footed cane. I am really disabled now. The prednisone is causing all kinds of subcutaneous hemorrhages on my arms, a lot of weight gain showed up, too. I've had bone density tests done, which are OK so far. (My mother had osteoporosis very severely.)I hate to see my blood vessels, skin, and bones being ruined by a drug I really need. The drs. say there is no other treatment, altho one added methotrexate once a week; my internist said people with PMR should not take methotrexate.I also have a degenerated disc in my back. The spine specialist gave me a shot, which he felt might help, but he has decided it didn't do much. My next stop will be the rheumatologist's office, but it takes several months to get an app't. I FEEL AS IF THESE AILMENTS ARE ALL PART OF A DISEASE PROCESS, RATHER THAN SEPARATE THINGS GOING WRONG. EVERY TIME I GET ANOTHER ONE OF THEM I FEEL THE SAME KIND OF 'SICK ALL OVER', TOTALLY EXHAUSTED, ETC. I AM ALSO IN PHYICAL THERAPY.DOES ANYONE OUT THERE HAVE A STORY THAT RELATES TO MINE?

"Blood Tests tomorrow - Consultant Wednesday so I have been trying to think how to explain to her the difference between a good day and a bad day. This is my formula:
Good Day: I can get out of bed! I can shower, wash and dry (even style) my hair. I can get my pants on, get my jeans on, even get a jumper on over my head. I'm pleasant to those around me, I smile and joke. I shop and clean and walk and cook. I am human!
Bad Day: I heave myself out of bed (and groan) I shower but have to leave my back wet because its a journey too far for the towel. My hair stays greasy and lank (arms won't reach head). I have to use the John Wayne method of getting my pants on ie: sit on the side of the bed with one leg outstretched. Throw the pants (lasso fashion) in the direction of the outstretched leg in the hope that pant leg hole and leg connect in an orderly fashion! I wear elasticated joggers and any top that fastens at the front. I'm grumpy (well my dearest says so) and I pass on anything other than the bare essentials of the day. Luckily for me I'm having far more good days than bad days at the moment and hope that this is the same for you all. Fingers crossed my bloods reflect the way I feel at the moment.
From Lizzie Ellen who is: Well dressed, with good hair and a dry back today!

"I am so exicted and exilerated to have found you all as I am 44 and have been suffering for over 2 years if not more and feel lost and have suffered very low spells with no one to talk to. My husband doesn't understand and struggles to get why I'm not better. This weekend was the worst again for six months as christmas shopping was beckonning as was the housework, ironing, dog walking and everything else that just knocks me for six. I am like all of you one that battles on and keeps going but the concrete overcoat, arm and leg pain this weekend left me in tears at 5.00 on Sunday morning and all I needed was someone to talk to.
I do recognise many of the symptoms, the lack of ability to get a dianoses or help and especially the ability to know how much and when to do things as a full time working mum I know someone in their 60's and another in their 70's who have been so helpful about PMR, one of which has GSA with the PMR and one had the PMR but these are not people I can chat to - merely people I know of.Both were bad enough to go straight onto steriods which my doctor is avoiding and I understand why, but I need that balance and help.
My doctor didn't see me after my results when my ESR was slowly rising (seemingly using the 12 times table) and the tests stopped about 48, but my CRP was normal. The female doctor I did see dianosed PMR as the only possible options bearing in mind some information about me and my family - my brother has AS, my mother has MS and my dad is still suffering the site effects of Guillain Barre clearly showing both parents have auto immune issues.
I am lost, very lost today - I am at work and fighting on and always do - but because the pains have become worse over the last 2 months since over doing the housework without reprieve I am back at the doctors, my own doctor thinking it was a virus and now admitting due to some vision difficulties tests are starting again. ESR is only 30 which surprises me as pain is as bad as when it was 48.
People just don't understand it - I feel like i've run flat out into a brick wall and battle to get up as I know i must not sit and allow myself to stiffen. My best time is walking my two fantastic dogs whom I love.
I enjoy reading and hearing your tips and will now be a regular visitor to the site.
Thank you to you all - I have some hope and support to look forward to as I get ignored because of my age.

"[color=blue:8f86ea1330][/color:8f86ea1330] :shock: Hi everyone. I have been reading your very supportive comments to each other and I thought wow, I need some of this. I have recently had a blood test and it showed that I had Polymyalgia Rhematica. At first I was delighted because at least I was going to get help for the terrible pains. I went onto steroids just this last Friday and already I can function better and sleep without pain. But now afyter reading about the side effects of steroids I am not sure whether I am able to cope mentally. I know this sounds silly but I already have an underactive thyroid and work hard at keeping my weight down, and one of the side effects as everyone knows is the weight gain plus a load of other unsavoury ones. I know I should not be thinking like this and I know it sounds pathetic. Are the side effects as bad as they say?

I am lucky enough to be tapering steroids down from 2.5 shortly.My consultant thinks I should stop taking 2.5mg and leave it at that but taking the advice some of you have given I asked my doctor if he would prescribe some 1mg tablets to get down from 2.5 mg slowly. As you know these tablets are not enteric coated and as I have had problems with bisophomates I wondered if anyone has had any problems with the 1mg and any suggestions you might have for overcoming any problems.

So a question for all you veterans out there (and this isn't a reference to age, in fact I've been suprised that some of you are so young!). When do the Prednisolone side effects start? At the moment I'm losing weight and just wondering at what point I will have to delve to the back of my wardrobe for my selection of bigger sizes :cry: Isn't this PMR really unpredictable? I had 5 days when I felt absolutely rotten, then 2 glorious days (which incidently coincided with my visit to the Consultant so she probably thinks I'm a malingerer) and today? Forget it!

"yeah!!! down to 5 mg as of yesterday so far ok. This is the number I've been waiting a year for because I've read the body makes the same amount naturally and the side effects are less once you are down to 5mg or less. Now from what I read on this site I need to slow down or risk going up again. This is such a great site to log on to and read other peoples experiances in fact I comunicate reguarly with a fellow avid bicycle rider and PMR sufferer in the UK I met on this site and it gives us the oppertunity to compare notes on both the bike and PMR.

If you did, I'd like to bet that you wished you had a Doctor Ellingham around to make such a quick diagnosis of PMR.
The poor chap in the story wasn't even a patient of his !
I wonder who is responsible for the subject in the story lines, I think the writers must have been delving deep, alongside that story was one of a man with abdominal pain caused by a hair-ball !!
Even though the 'story' of the man with PMR was very short, at least it got a mention !

She's not prepared to give me a positive diagnoses yet as the latest blood results don't entirely support Polymyalgia. I have to come off of the Prednisolone ( :shock: ) next week (when the knee is OK) so she can evaluate my bloods properly. Sounds like fun. I don't seem to be text book although showing all the signs of PMR. My problem started with a very sudden attack of fever, pain, stiffness in both muscles and joints that lasted for 2 days then almost 3 months of reasonable recovery. Then one morning I woke up and just couldn't turn over or get out of bed and this is only helped by the steroids. Has anyone else had this experience? I'd be very interested to know. Can't say I'm looking forward to coming off the Pred, however I do need a positive diagnoses so I can be treated accordingly. Sorry this is such a long missive!!

"Hi,i am 42 and have been suffering from PMR for about 2 years, my
condition was not diagnosed until recently because i had other medical
problems which were serious, so my aches and pains were not top of
the list. About 4 months ago it got much worse especially my arms
shoulders hands and knees. I am in pain all the time but if i go outside
my comfort zone, as i call it, the pain is unbareable. This happens if i
try to raise my arms, or move my arms slightly backwards. I can not
get myself up once i am sitting on the floor because of the pain and
weakness in my limbs. I wonder if anyone gets uncontrollable shakes
in their arms and legs when climbing stairs and trying to support your
legs and knees with your arms? As many sufferers know, PMR is very
debilitating and if affects your whole life. I do not moan to other people
because they very rarely understand how much pain it causes.
Unfortunately i am unable to take steroids due to a stomach condition
so i rely on codeine which i am fast becoming imune to. I wonder if there
are any other sufferers that can not take steroids? Also has anyone tried
these gadgets that are advertised for\""Natural Pain Relief\""? I would
welcome any comments you have.

"Being fairly new to PMR- diagnosed in July- I was put on 3omg of pred. This worked miraculously. Since then I`ve reduced by 2.5mg every two weeks and am now on 25mg. The thing is the pain is gradually coming back, though not severe, and I`m prepared to put up with that so long as it doesn`t come back in my head. What I want to know is- are we supposed to stay on a high dose to stay totally pain free? I can`t wait to get rid of steroids, the weight,the sleeplessness etc. Some of you are obviously still in some pain. I`m reluctant to tell the doctor it`s coming back.

Had my bloods taken last Tuesday so hope when I see the doc on Monday I may get down to 25 mg. At the moment whenever I use my hands they go into the most horrific cramp. My husband says he`s frightened of what the neighbours must think when they hear my constant screams from the kitchen ! Incidentally I meant to ask if anyone else thought PMR might be hereditary ? My mother had it from the age of about 72 .
I do admire all those of you who walk regularly. I`m on a hill and having COPD makes it impossible to just go outside for a walk so I tend to do it in the house. Of course there`s always the supermarket. The staff at Tesco are used to me dancing at the till with cramp in my feet- it happens every time- even before I went on this course of pred for PMR. I`ve always blamed the three inhalers I have to use for COPD. Having read some of these posts I think I`ll up my Adcal D3 to 2 a day. Actually when I was in hospital last they did that but my doc didn`t alter my script once i was home. Keep smiling :lol: Shebob

"hi fellow sufferers,
I was diagnosed with temperal artritis in december '08 after several visits to different doctors and many tests finally got some answers. Started on 60mg prednisolone now on 8.5mg. I also have angina, planta faciitis, underactive thyroid,back problems and now my hair is falling out which i have been told is the medication apart from all that everything is great as i still have my sight for which I am thankful for.
Has anyone suffered hair lose?
I have read all postings on this site, some made me laugh, also after reading about bone scan asked my doctor about it she agreed I should have one am waiting for the results.
My rheumatoligist calls this disease The Enigma Disease as they do not know alot about it, so I was gald when i found this site, but it took me along time to work out how to use it as i am new to e-mailing etc.
regards to all

"I have had PMR for over a year - since May 2008. The initial dose of prednisolone was 15 to 17mg and that immediately got rid of 80% of the pain and aching in my thighs and shoulders and also the flu like symptoms. However, I still have some stiffness and pain in my thigh muscles, which on bad days makes walking difficult. Perhaps this is a knock-on effect coming from my bad back, since I now waddle.
My plasma viscosity is at present 1.62 (down from a high of 1.96) and my GP thinks ALL the pain should now have gone. I have spoken to a friend of mine who developed PMR at almost the same time and she has not had any more pain AT ALL after treatment. (She was however treated with a starting dose of pred of 40mg - presumably because she had a tender scalp - a possible symptom of GCA)
So, should all PMR sufferers be free of pain once they are on prednisolone? I think my GP is starting to doubt the diagnosis of PMR, but it is hard to see what else it could be - my symptoms (and blood tests) seem to me textbook.

"Would be most interested to hear if anyone has had pains in the calf of legs as a result of their PMR? I was diagnosed last summer with all the usual symptoms, started on 9mg pred which certainly cured the dreadful upper body pains but then doc found I had no pulse in feet and sent me for all manner of tests. Walking became a real problem, with severe calf pains after about 3 mins, not easy to accept for someone like me who loves walking. Steroid dose went up and down until March this year when CRP level went sky high (110) and ESR 59 following a urinary infectio n which sent everyone into a panic, including me! All nasty reasons were thankfully eliminated so put on 60mg pred and turns out I had contracted peripheral arterial disease in legs and also some soft tissue thickening around the aorta which could be really serious. My specialist at hospital was wonderfully supportive although does treat me as a medical freak which is rather worrying! I've been gradually coming down from 60 mg, now on 15 and all CRP/ESR levels back to normal, but the pain in the legs just getting worse. Now waiting the results of this weeks CT scan to see if the thickening has reduced as the steroid dose comes down, but they are now suggesting I go in for an angioplasty on both legs to relieve the pain. Noone yet has definitely told me all this is a nasty side effect of PMR, but to me it just too much of a coincidence, as I was previously fit as a fiddle, no high blood pressure, cholesterol, never smoked etc etc.
I'm not convinced angioplasty is the answer either as would prefer to cure myself by exercise etc, but now getting rather frightened. Any ideas would be much appreciated.

"Hello Fellow Sufferers.
I am a 52 year old female and I have recently been diagnosed with PMR.
I have been reading the comments on here since then, many of which I can empathise with, and some that have made me laugh, which does help !
At the start of this year I felt as though I had flu' on the way. Then I found myself telling colleagues that if I didn't know better, I would have thought someone had thrown me down a flight of stairs. I was even looking in the mirror at the back of my legs for bruises !
I had given up my weekly swim as I was afraid they'd have to hoist me out of the pool if I seized up.
After several weeks of putting up with this, I visited my GP, I thought maybe the statins I were taking had caused the muscle problems. He agreed and said to come back in a month or so to see if there was any improvement.
Well, after only a week or so I was back to see him. The pain and stiffness had got so bad, unable to get out of bed unaided, needed help just to put a pair of socks on etc. etc.
The swelling across my back , neck and shoulders had become very obvious.
I felt as though I was trying to walk with concrete blocks in my arms and legs. When driving, putting on the handbrake became more and more painful, then gave up when changing gear became too much.
After blood tests showed raised ESR, I was put on 20mg prednisolone mid April, the pain decreased and my movement improved the next day. Hurrah !
Then two days later I experienced vertigo and sickness. GP prescrbed something for that though and the following week the prednisolone was reduced to 15mg.
On 11th May I was told my ESR had dropped from 30 to 19 and to stay on 15mg for another week and then go down to 12.5mg. Had another bout of the dizziness, luckily still had the pills for that !
Returned to see my GP a couple of days ago. He was hoping to reduce the steroids again, but was reluctant to do so when he saw how swollen and tender my back, neck and shoulders still are. I am unable to walk very far, half an hour is more than plenty. This is from someone who is used to walking up mountains most weekends. He decided to refer me to a rheumatologist and and has taken more blood. Later the same day he rang me to say that he had spoken to the consultant , who thinks that I wasn't on the 20mgs for long enough before reducing them. So as of now I am back to where I started.
I could go on more about the many things that are affecting me with this, but I won't bore you all anymore, as most of you will have already been there and got the t-shirt !! Going back to see my GP next week, when my sick certificate runs out , if anyones interested I'll let you know the outcome. Many thanks for the opportunity to share our troubles.

It;s like having frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel and numb hands all the time. Doctor said she was sure I had polymyalgia rhematica and sent me off for a blood test. Got the results today which says bloods look normal, so does this mean I cant have PMR?b she told me she was 95% sure I did. Dont know what to think now, the pain is still there and nothing will ease it. Maybe some one out there can offer some advice. Thanks for reading . Zara x

"I've been reading many of the comments posted on this site for the first time, despite having had pmr for several years with fluctuating intensity. I have found it reassuring and enlightening so thank you to all those who have previously commented!
I am prompted to post my own question as I wondered if anyone out there is in the same situation as me - that is currently off sick from work with pmr? It is the first time I have had to take sick leave, having managed to keep working up till now, but finally had to give in in May this year as things got steadily worse, despite very supportive manager and, initially adjusted hours (including working from home one day a week). I'm now wondering if I'll ever get back to work as there seems to be no improvement. I am currently on 6mg prednisalone and 12.5mg methetrexate but have not had any improvement since starting on the methetrexate. I'm wondering if I should think about early retirement. Has anyone taken retirement on health grounds due to pmr? Look forward to hearing any comments!

"I seem to be one of few men with PMR at age 65
I was diagnosed about 3 months ago and put on 30mg of pred with the instructions to reduce it by 5mg every week until the pains reappeared, then to reduce more slowly as I saw fit, then return for blood test after about 3 months.
Well, it all went fine at first, the pains almost completely disappeared within 2 or 3 days and started to reappear slightly more when I got down to 10mg. I slowly went down to 3.5mg over a period of about 6 weeks the pain started getting quite bad, so I had a blood test - ESR 37 and CRP 10 and saw my doctor. She told me to go up to 7.5mg and see how I got on. The pains continued to get worse so I tried 10mg and they still got worse. By this time was feeling pretty despondent. I saw my doctor again (this was yesterday) and she said I needed to go up 30mg again! So I have taken my first dose this morning. Too soon to feel any effects yet.
I find that the pred make me feel very tired and I do not sleep well at night but I seem to be lucky in that I have no other side effects. Also these disappear below 10mg.
I will keep you informed of my progress (or lack of it!)

"This week's problem (mine seem to come in threes these days)
I have today been diagnosed with a blood clot (DVT) in the right leg after two or three weeks thinking I'd pulled or twisted a muscle.
I'm now on Warfarin as well as everything else (don't ask, I've lost count -I think it makes me on something like 17 prescription drugs).
I'm already being investigated for possible GCA alongside the PMR and just at this moment I have no idea what impact this will have on everything else - the hospital doctors didn't seem too bothered about what other drugs I was taking.
I am seeing my GP tomorrow and hope to get some answers, but I wondered if anyone else had any similar experience?
Wonder what next week will bring? Struck by lightning, probably!
Hugs to all those on here, in pain, and teed off with it all.

"Hi all,
I''m in the process of tapering my prednisiline dose and have reduced over the last few months from 30mg down to 13.5mg and have found that at each drop it takes about three or four days for my body to notice the reduction and react with muscle pain, sweating, tiredness and generally feeling unwell but if I persevere after a week or two I improve until by week three to four I feel good and am ready to take the next drop. Two weeks ago I droppedfrom 13.5mg to 11mg and although this time it took longer for the withdrawal symptoms to kick in they are much worse and don't seem to be improving so far. Has anyone any thoughts or experience of this and any suggestions on whether it is better to perservere in order to get to a lower dose as soon as possible or whether increasing the dose by say 1mg for a while to alleviate the symptoms?

"Unusual for me, that is. I'm being checked very regularly as I am on a slow steroid reduction programme. This time round, for the first time since I was diagnosed although the inflammation levels are low, there is evidence of giant cells/giant platelets.
It will be checked again at the end of July and I am still continuing with the reduction proramme, but it's puzzling to say the least of it!
I have no other signs or symptoms of GCA and never have had, and I'm sure I'd know if there were any such signs.
Anybody out there had anything similar?
On a different note, the heat is really taking it's toll on me and I'm sure I'm not the only one. I think I melted yesterday into a small puddle on the floor. I'm on strike as far as the housework is concerned and I can't wait for it to cool off! I've been given the go-ahead to take Sage to see if it will help with this excessive sweating, starting today.

"I was recently diagnosed with Polymyalgia Rheumatica which was a bit of shock having been fit and active all my life. It came on out of nowhere, one morning I could not get out of bed. The pain was incredible when I tried to move. My first thoughts were that it was flu and I tried painkillers, Paracetamol then Ibruprofen. Never taken anything other than Aspirin before. After a couple of weeks with no sleep because the pain was so intense I saw the doctor and was prescribed Diclofenac Sodium, this never worked and another doctor sent me for a blood test which showed up PMR. She put me on Prednisolone steroids which took away the pain except for in the wrists where it seemed to concentrate. I have managed to ditch the Ibruprofen now. The doctor also prescribed two other pills, one for protection on bleeding from the stomach (a side effect) Omeprazole capsules. When I started on these I had some severe stomach pains so stopped for a few days. I can now tolerate these. The other pills are Adcal-D3 lemon for the bones. Seems like no one is sure what triggers PMR, my doctor said it could have been a virus I never knew I had. Wonder if any fellow sufferers have any ideas on this. Also this seems to be a bit of a Cinderella of a disease, can't find any specific research on it. Would be interested to hear if anyone has more knowledge. Or any groups looking for some helpful information. Would be grateful for any suggestion of how to cope with coming off the steroids. DIZZY.

I have just been yold it is likely to be PMR having been given other possible diagnosis first. I have been having monthly steroid injections with some effect but have been told to let these wear off so I can start oral steroids. Funnily enough the symptons have disappeared in the last week before any further treatment, is that usual for this illness? Is it likely to come back? and doea the weather affect symptons?

"I have had TA for about seven years and had just gotten off of Prednisone a couple of months ago and then PMR set in. My Rheumatologist started me on a low dose of Prednisone, but then things went beserk. I had several bad falls and then couldn't walk, stand, or get out of bed without help. My doctor upped the med. to 40 mg, and things calmed down. Now I am on 20 mg. I am 73 and it has not been a fun time. I have had many side effects from the Prednisone and worry about being back on it, but I may have to be on it the rest of my life. I hope I'm not discouraging anyone, for my doctor really thinks that I am a special case - a hard nut to crack. Here is one for the medical books. My husband also developed TA and later PMR. However his case was not as bad and he soon recovered. Thank goodness. It was encouraging for me to hear that other people had the same symptoms. If you just have PMR, alert your doctor about any headache because you do not want to get TA. It is much more serious and can cause blindness.

"Have had PMR for 8 devastating years now (or possibly 10 - suffered chronic muscle pain for more than 2 years before diagnosis). On steroids all this time, now have chronic asthma, diabetes and very difficult digestive problems. Dosage of prednisolone has gone up and down over the years, but always the pain returned. Now on 5mg per day, down from 15mg in 6 months as I took a deliberate decision to reduce dose. Pain returned almost immediately, bearable at first, now not liveable with. Cannot now put up dose as get very swollen feet on trying, but would prefer not to anyway. However, cannot live like this, unable to have any kind of life. It's very depressing. Have tried in the past various alternative pain relief such as acupuncture (very good results) massage and heat treatment (good short term relief). Cannot work now, so can't afford these treatments which are not available on the NHS.

"Hello, I'm a 50 year old female. I was diagnosed with PMR by my GP in May 2008. I felt the odds were against this being PMR as I considered myself too young at 49 and also the guy I shared an office with had just recovered from it. He was also considered young to get it at 57. I am also hypothyroid and going through a very difficult menopause.
My symptoms were a feverish achiness which started in my legs, but eventually spread to the whole of my body from my eyes and ears to the soles of my feet. I had a feeling of irritation in my airways, which made me cough and I felt breathless all the time. I lost weight quickly, which under normal circumstances would've made me jump for joy, but I became very depressed and lethargic.
I am normally a fit and active person enjoying exercising my dogs twice a day, cycling to and fro work, swimming twice weekly and tending my garden. I was unable to do any of this until I'd been on 30 mg prednisolone for about a week - no instant relief for me. For the last 3 weeks I've been on 7 mgs. Most of the time I can lead a normal life, but I can get several days at a time when I'm so tired and lethargic I can barely get out of bed and it's hard to know if it's the PMR, my thyroid or the menopause that's causing it.
I do have a question to which I would dearly love to know the answer. Have any of you post menopausal ladies had a return to monthly bleeds since starting Prednisolone?

"Hi all,
Since I have been in the habit of breaking my Prednisolone tablets (10mg and 5mg and more recently 2.5mg) in half to get better control of the dose, I've always wondered if it was actually safe to do so. I recently asked the doctor if I could be sure I would get half the dose in each half or if the manufacturing process didn't care and could leave more in one side of the tablet than the other. As I said in another posting, he gave me a very off-hand answer which left me none the wiser.
I've just gotten around to searching a little on the web and found that people talk of tablets as being \""scored\"" (or not).
Here is a quote from one such site...
- \""Generally if a tab is scored, then it can be halved safely, and yes, you
would receive only half the dose of the total medication\"".
So it seems the score line is an indication that the tablet can be broken in two safely.
Fortunately all my tablets have the score line on one side; so I'm pleased about that.
(Apparently the reason these are so popular is that lower dose tablets often cost almost as much as higher dose ones. So by breaking high dose ones in half you can double your supply of low dose ones for the same cost.)
All the best; davblo

"I was diagnosed at age 52 (5 years ago). I`d had severe headaches for about 3 weeks and flu like symptoms for about 8 weeks but never developed flu, and felt generally awful, and had some blurring of vision in my left eye. A blood test (esr) was very high at 123 (NORMAL is 1-10). I was seen by the eye doctors at the hospital and they started me on steroids 60mg a day. A biopsy of the artery was negative but because i had all the symptoms they still thought i had Temporal arteritis and i have been on steroids ever since ,gradually decreasing the dose or increasing temporarily as needed. I am now on 5mg prednisolone a day plus drugs for osteoporosis, Aspirin, iron tablets. I recently had a mini-stroke and have severe carotid stenosis and am due to have a Carotid Endarterectomy in the near future. I am feeling better now than I have for the past 5 years,even though I had to take early retirement from work. I also had cataract operations on both eyes. these may have been caused by the steroids. I try to walk everyday and do some exercise. Its hard when you don`t have much energy but worth it. Its important to pace yourself , and do things in short bursts when you have the energy, and not try to do it all at once.It took me quite a long time to get the hang of this,and I often ended up exhausted after only a short time.I was under the care of a rheumatologist who is experienced with this condition .hope this helps someone else with this condition.

"Has anyone any experience of methotrexate as an alternative to prednislone. I am currently taking 7 mgs of prednislone a day for PMR having come down from 15 mgs over a 7 month period. The pain is coming back and I really should increase my the dose but the side affects are a great concern and having taken 7 months to get down I don't want to start going back up again!
Also has anyway tried specific diets, starch free?

"Hello everyone
Has anyone had invasive dental work whilst on steroids? Have lost a crown because the post has fractured in the gum. My new dentist is concerned about my health problems not least the steroids whilst doing invasive dental surgery. Another bare root he says may have to be dealt with in hospital perhaps at a later date when I am off the steroids!!!
I would be grateful to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience, please.

"I had been struggling to find what was wrong with me for well over 12mths. I had a broader range of symptoms than just the neck hip and shoulder symptoms. I had nerve conduction tests on my hands as every morning i was flat out bending them they were so stiff, and numbness. I had what I thought was terrible lower back problems and had to keep in good alignment through the night or my hips/waist area would hurt so much. I could hardly use one shoulder for weeks. I struggled to hang out and bring in the washing, holding up my arms. I suffered fatigue, dizziness, numerous tender areas over body, stiffness and aches everywhere. My legs/knees would ache terribly especially at night. I felt like an 80yr old woman in my body. I had to cut back at work as I just couldn't manage so many shifts. I lived off nurofen plus. I found a dr who looked back over my numerous blood tests and found my esr had been continually elevated although not as high as he would've thought for my symptoms. I didn't have rheumatoid either. I border anemia. He finally diagnosed pmr and said I would know quickly if it is. Well one dose of steroid and I could tell a difference. One month on and I can't believe I had to wait so long to get some help. I hate the steroids but I can tell you I felt I had just about no quality of life left! Now I actually want/feel I can do things. The steroids help me to live and continue to work. I feel I have no real choice but to take them as I know how I was without them and I had reached the end of my tether. I was too young to have to settle for feeling like 80!!

"I have had PMR for 18 months now. I started on 15 mgs predisolone, have only ever decreased down to 10 but am now and often up to 14. In an effort to reduce this my consultant 7 weeks ago prescribed 7.5 gms methotrexate and folic acid. I had no quarrel with this as I am usually good at taking medication without any side effects. 2 weeks later I felt extremely unwell - complete exhaustion, breathlessness, stomach and groin and hip pains and severe depression. Sleeping 14 hours a day. At the time I did not associate this with anything. My Doctor and myself after relaying my symptons thought it might be a urinary tract infection as I have suffered from these in the past, but after a course of antibiotics the symptoms still remain. I then saw two doctors at my medical centre and they thought perhaps it was an underactive thyroid - I have had the tests and my thyroid is fine. It was only a week ago that it occurred to me that it might be the methotrexate - so I stopped taking it. Went back to my GP who didn't think it was the methotrexate and referred me the next day to the rheumatologist consultant - he likewise thought it unlikely to be the medication and I have been completely x-rayed all over, numerous blood tests and am awaiting a brain scan. As I was fine 7 weeks ago and leading a normal life I am wondering if anybody out there has had a similar experience. At the moment I am sleeping my life away, living on co-codomol and so tired and useless I can hardly eat a meal all the way through.
Looking at what I have just written, I think i should add self-pity - sorry. Just hope it is the methotrexate and it will wear off.

":oops: :cry:
There is plenty of dogma still about PMR. In truth it is very difficult to diagnose. A lot of the statements in this article are based on very flimsy evidence. There is a big issue about case ascertainment in studies looking at PMR. PMR is often over-diagnosed and many different conditions can be misdiagnosed as such. I wouldn't say mimic - I would say misinterpretaed and misdiagnosed specifically. I think all people possibly with this condition should see a rheumatologist and not accept the GP's diagnosis unless the Gp can confirm they have ruled out the following: axial and/or proximal structure CPPD Disease; multi-level radiculopathy; spinal stenosis; spondylarthropathy; myeloma, myopathy (metabolic, endocrine, inflammatory, drug-induced etc - the list is long). The rheumatology literature is rife with erroneously diagnosed cases of PMR. Beware of thoser doctors who are quick to make the diagnosis, consider no investigations - beware of doctors's hubris in this sense. See a rheumatologist - otherwise you get put on steroids - long-term - they do damage - you can't get off them and you get very annoyed when you do finally learn from a rheumatologist that you shouldn't have been on them in the first place.

"I am 57 and have always been active--hill walking, golf, sailing, etc. In 2002/2003 I sailed round the world, and about a year later suffered from an unidentified virus which caused severe headaches over a 3 month period before departing as quickly as it arrived. Early this year I began to feel unusually tired, with tight hamstrings and neck and upper arm pains. I blamed it on my wife's \""to do \""lists but with no sympathy!! When I went to my GP she thought the symptoms unusual and sent me to see a Rheumatologist who immediately said I had classic PMR symptoms, confirmed by blood tests. She put me on a dose of 15 mgs of prednisone, to be reduced after a month to 12.5 and now to 10. Some pain has returned but my blood tests are back to normal so she is advising me to remain on 10 for a couple of months before reducing further by 1 mg per month. I currently get tired quickly (especially with home chores) but can play 18 holes of golf and carry on most of my normal activities, albeit at a reduced level. The only clear side effects from the steroids seem to be sleep patterns--quick to go to sleep, but after 3 hours I am wide awake--and for someone who could always sleep through anything, this has been frustrating.My weight may have increased a bit, but as I am taking less exercise, that may be expected. So, at this point, I should not complain too much, certainly in comparison to others. But of course all things are relative and I would like to be back to full health. Nor do I want to have any lasting side-effects from steroids, so the sooner I am off them the happier I will be. I do wonder, having read some of the experiences of others on the \""Patient UK\"" web page how I fit in with other peoples experiences. Most of those writing in seem to be more severely affected than me, and there are few stories of full recovery, and yet the medical view is that \""most\"" people suffer for 18-24 months before making a full recovery. Maybe it those with severe cases or poor diagnoses who feel compelled to write, but it would be good to know that there are \""mundane\"" PMR sufferers like me, and that they do get better!! So there you have it-should be too young to get PMR, not female, and not too severe--anyone out there in a similar position? But I have been pleased and fortunate with the medical help. David

"I would be interested to know if any other sufferer of PMR/GCA out there experiences unabating stiffness of knees and ankles in spite of steroid dose. Although all my other symptoms of PMR/GCA improved on the high dose steroids (now on 5mg) this symptom has not. I also find that on going for a walk, after about 20-30 minutes, my legs weaken, pain worsens and I have to sit down. On continuously mentioning my leg situation to the rheumatologist on my vists, he says it is to do with my own muscles not the steroids. I am just a bit concerned that the steroids are in fact producing the symptoms! I hope everyone else out there is improving and able to enjoy life. Good wishes to all of you.

"I have been suffering with the following symptoms for around 3 years....neck pain, stiff neck (left side only), shoulder pain (left side only), shoulder blade pain and stiffness that generates into my upper back, and severere headaches. The pain is constant and like a burning sensation. More recently (last five weeks) I have a problem with pain in my left eye/temple area and at the back of my head. Also extreme tiredness. I have been to the doctors on numerous occasions and feel that I am becoming an annoyance. They have tried medication for migrane, blood tests and found that I was slightly aneamic. I get so frustrated with the pain that I generally get tearful when I visit the doctor and so they think I am stressed or depressed. My last visit was five weeks ago because of the pain moving to my eye....before then I had just resigned myself to get on with the pain. I was prescribed amitriptalyne which have not helped at all, but made me even more tired !!!! Out of desparation I made an appointment privately with an osteopath. I have been twice and had no improvement....if anything its worse and more. I am a 42 years old female...what can I do????[/b]

I am hoping when I see the specialist next month he will allow me to try and discontinue the meds, as the weight gain is the only problem.

"Just over 5 years ago I started experiencing difficulty in standing and walking.Tolerated it for some time before going to the GP as knew he would say I needed to lose weight and my back pain was wear and tear. Always being an outgoing person and laid back ,I found my personality was changing due to the discomfort I felt.I seemed to get one cold after another and not able to shake them off completely.Eventually went to my GP whom I had been with 20yrs. He said exactly what I knew he would. As my condition got worse.I took the advantage when he was on holiday to see another Doctor locum who said it sounded like PMR. Never heard of it before. He was not sure I fitted into the age group for it .I was then 59 yrs. old.A month later after yet another flu-like cold I developed Severre headache in the left side of my head and over my eye ,I saw another doctor who prescribed me antibiotics as he thought I had sinus . I might add I am not prone to headaches. 3 days later it was so bad I saw the same doctor and he sent me for a Blood test. 4 hrs. later another GP was knocking on my door with a Prescription of Prednisolone and told me to take 40mgs. straight away and said I had Temporal Arteritus. To keep on 40mgs. and go and see my GP in 3 days. This I did and he refereed me to a Rheumatologist. Meanwhile I had to reduce the Steroids gradually as the pain in my head went almost on taking the 1st. dose.Over 2 months later I saw the Rheumatologist. He said it was doubtful I had PMR.as did not seem to fit the criteria.After several more tests and visits to him he found I had too much Calcium in my blood stream and diagnosed Hyperparathyroidism.Then passed me on to a General surgeon to have the offending gland removed.Also adding all my symptons would disappear after having the op. I then had to lose weight before they would operate and reduce my Steroids to do this. The Rheumatologist said he did not want to see me again.I did as I was told lost over a stone and reduced Steroids down to 3 mgs. Then my headache started again.So back up to 28mgs. this time advised by my new GP. As my other one had semi-retired.This happened about 4 weeks before I was due to have my op.The surgeon said he would operate by Local anaescetic as had put some more weight back on.The first op. was not sucessful so he made an appointment for me to have it done again under a General a... 9 months later. This time it was successful. I waited and waited for the miracle to happen of feeling OK again ,but it did not happen.After up and down on the Steroids advised by my GP for all the other things which were happening to me he referred me back to the Rheumatologist ,this time a different one. He too said some things did not add up.After all kinds of tests And no positive name to my problems.(Although he did pencil in PMR. on my notes )Also bearing in mind my SED was raised all the way through although still on Steroids. He just dismissed me saying my GP needed to help me lose weight and try and get off the Steroids,and take painkillers for the pain. These I have avoided all my life as they do not agree with me. I have been down to 5 mgs. Predisolone since December but things are getting worse I cannot hardly use my hands now ,have constant pain in my legs and other parts I never had before. Recently diagnosed with having Diabetas 2.Have to use a wheelchair when I go out . My GP. says I have got PMR.I have avoided even going back to him as he will up my Steroids and I do not want this.I have so many symptons which others have in their postings. I have now joined a Support Group and signed the petition.At least I feel more positive after reading of others plight. I am now 65yrs. and my plans for my retirement seem to be a figment of my imagination. I do hope more can be investigated into this cruel condtion. I live in hope.

"I was just wondering if anyone had alot of fluid retention when this started? Within a few days I was retaining about 10 pounds of fluid when this started. I had swelling in my ankles, feet, knees, wrists, and hands. At the time I was stiff and sore in all those joints, but felt that my hip, shoulder, and neck joints were good. I could not make a fist. It was really hard to move. After blood work, I was told that my aldolase, ESR, and C-reactive protein were all elevated. Its been about 5 months since this all started and I can notice what feels like a pinched nerve in my left neck/shoulder area. Thighs feel a bit fatigued, but no pain anywhere. I am currently on 9 mg of prednisone a day. I was 43 at time of onset and am now 44 years old. I was just wondering if anyone else had a similar onset.

"I would urge all patients who have PMR and GCA to write to NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) address given at the end of this message.
Diagnostic Procedures, which have to be cleared by NICE before being issued throughout the NHS to GPs and Rheumatologists have been forwarded to NICE for clearance.
As patients, most of you know how difficult it has been to be diagnosed with PMR and GCA and in the case of the latter a late diagnosis can result in either total or partial loss of vision.
To get a standard procedure in place would greatly help new patients. To this end would you please write to NICE urging them to speed the clearance of these procedures. Each day we do not have these diagnostic procedures in place means that patients are suffering for longer than necessary.

"I have today been sent for tests for PMR and as I already suffer with hyppthyroidism am concerned at having two conditions that seem little understood and incurable - only controllable. Has anyone else experience of these conditions together and if so can they offer any advise partcularly on whether exercise makes PMR better worse or no different. I feel if I don't keep moving then everything will cease altogether and yet it hurts so much it's very difficult to get motivated to get going. Sorry to ramble - I just feel so old.

"I have had PMR for almost 2 years now, for which prednisilone more or less masks the symptoms. At one stage I got down to 8mg a day but a ‘surge’ of symptoms last November meant I had to go back to 15mg. I am now taking methotrexate 20mg a week, and have simultaneously got the prednisilone down to 9mg. I supplement this medication by taking co-dydramol two or three times a day, when necessary.
Prednisilone has induced Type 2 Diabetes, but the worst side effect has been weight loss (now arrested, thank goodness) which is the opposite effect to that usually experienced. This loss is mostly from my leg muscles, which has resulted in my having little energy for walking.
All sorts of tests have been done to see whether the weight loss is caused by some other illness, but nothing has been discovered.
I shall be grateful to hear whether any others have had similar unexplained weight loss.

My husband was diagnosed as having lung cancer nearly two years ago. This turned out to be a \""mistake\"" and he was given the all clear. We went through 10 days of hell before we were told that there had been an error. My husband was just glad that he was ok but three days after the \""all clear\"" I woke up in the morning unable to move. At first my G.P. thought I was suffering from a post viral illness?/fibromyalgia. I was soon put on prednisalone (20 mg per day) which completely eradicated all my symptoms. I thought I was cured. I was taken off steroids and my agony returned. I was then prescribed prednisalone for one month 10 mg. of predisalone, and again my symptoms disappeared. I was taken off steroids one month later and I had a dramatic relapse. I have now been on a reducing dose of steroids until I reached 3 mg but gradually my symptoms returned. I have now developed athritis in both knees, I am going through the menopause, and I have increased my weight ++++
I am due to have blood tests but I feel that I have been overlooked+++

"I am a 57 year old female. I was diagnosed with PMR Oct 2006. I was prescribed 15 mgs a day of Prednisone and immediately felt wonderful. My Sed rate came down to normal and I then started to reduce the Prednisone by 1 mg a month. I got down to 10 and then the symptoms started to flare up again. I increased up to 12 and then to 15 because the symptons were still there. At 15 mgs I was fine. So the process started again. Month by month reducing 1mg. Until I got to 9 mg and then a repeat of the same, symptons came back. My sed rate and CRP (?) were both elevated. I have now gone back up to 15 mg but am not nearly as good as I was previously at 15 mgs. The normal symptoms wear off but I am left with a dull ache almost cramp like pains in my legs, arms, toes and fingers which gets worse in the evenings and no pain killers will shift. And I am getting pains in my neck (not the PMR pain). I read that one of the side effects of the Predinisone can be neck and back pain. Is anyone else experiencing anything like this, particularly the crampy aches?
Have been following this site for a while and finding it really helpful knowing there are others out there.
Look forward to hearing from someone?

"I am not sure if I have pmr or not but am in a bitof a fix. I am 54 and well over twelve months ago I got a problem with my left arm, the muscle at the top. You know when you do a Popeye type pose and show your muscles off? Well that' the bit that hurts. I found I was unable to extend my arm or use it really at all....couldn't reach to put something away in a kitchen cupboard or reach to close car pasenger door when I was sitting in car - all caused unbearable pain and almost made me vomit it was so bad. I had a bad back and slipped disc on and off for years from being around 20 years old - it ceased in my early forties but I always had a numb area on the outerpart of my right thigh and this would either be quite numb or itch like crazy....similar area on my back, just under right shoulder blade. Right...sorry to go on but I want you to know my symptoms as my GP has always put everything down to my disc problems and now I am not so sure. I have experienced great pain over the last four or five years on walking any great distance - for instance if shopping I would get a dull pain in my right hip area and know it was time to head home. I have always been able to cope with this but lately it has been rather worse, walking in Tesco or B & Q after driving there in the car with my husband - after about half an hour - bingo - pain and discomfort....but just about bearable until yesterday. We drove into Sheffield to do some quiet Sunday Christmas shopping and I almost collapsed. The pain started as usual in my right hip area but moved down onto the right outer thigh, it stayed above my knee on the outer edge and every time I tried to put my right foot down it was like an electric shock running up and down my thigh....burning hot and absolutely redugcing me to tears., literally. I felt so silly and had to be helped to walk by my husband to get to our car. We had been looking around in one department store only for about an hour but I couldn't take another step and had to come home. When I sat down at home it eased off completely. I also wake in the night with horrendous sweats and have been taking a tablet called Dixarit ( or Clonidine) 25mcg 3 twice daily fro over a year now - my GP prescribed this for menopausal sweats. It never works at night though it does help in the daytime. I also have a sort of toothache like pain during the night when I wake and this affects my hips and legs seeming to be worse on the side I have been lying on.It is no too bad though and I find if I adjust my position I can go to sleep again fairly easily. I also have complete numbness in my hands - sometimes only one hand sometimes both when I wake during the night and have to shake them to try and get the life back into them. Can be awkward to actually do anything with no feeling in them - try going to the loo without hands...a bit difficult! I work from home so I am very lucky in that area however I am today too afraid to go to the post office around the corner in case I get the pain and burning symptom I had yesterday...I don't know how I would get back home again. I feel frightened today - I don't want to be a burden to my husband who is five years younger than me and as fit as a flea and I want my life back. Does anyone identify with these symptoms? Please please email me on mary@net192.com or reply via this website if you think this sounds like pmr I am so depressed today I hardly know what to do. I have tried to make an appointment to see my GP today - no appointments this week so I asked for one in two weeks time when my husband is off work to take me - guess what? Its not possible to make an appointment two weeks in advance. I just got to keep trying I suppose on a daily basis and hope for a cancellation. Thanks in advance for taking the trouble to read this and apologies if I have gone on too long - but thanks anyway.One more thing - I cannot seem to take a bath anymore - it absolutely exhausts me and I used to love a long hot soak at the end of the day. If I take a bath I sweat and then have chills for about two to three hours afterwards and feel so bad I have to lie down. This has been the case for about eight weeks or so and I am having to take showeres instead which have no ill effects to date. Thanks again, MARY

"I was diagnosed with PMR by the GP - i guess I was lucky. The symptoms were typical - muscular pain in shoulders and upper arms, inner thighs, unable to get out of bed, out of a chair, night sweats, etc so it was a no brainer. He gave me 20 mg Prednisone before I left the surgery and by the evening I was practically pain free and continue to be so - even masks my poor old osteo arthritis aches and pain.
I would feel great if I wasn't so tired. Some days are better than others, on bad days I rarely leave the couch, on a good day I have periods of high activity followed by a desperate need to have a sit down. Any one else have this problem? Does it go away gradually? I've only neen taking the Prednisone for 3 weeks - 20 mg per day and haven't yet had a follow up ESR. What have you all experienced?
It's wonderful to have a website like this. With symptoms so varied it's hard to get a straight answer from your doc, but at least you can check in so see what other people are experiencing. I'm absolutely shocked to read the number of people who were not diagnosed immediately, even with classic symptoms.

"I am 69 years young from the North of England and was diagnosed with GCA in February followed, within 6 weeks, with PMR.
The GCA was quickly brought under control with a maximum dose of 40 mg prednislone, but the PMR is appalling. I have managed to get down to 20mg and await the next step down. Yes, weight gain, moon face and peach fuzz. But the upside is permanent tan - so do not have to bother with make-up.
I am wondering does anyone else suffer with pain in the lower back which actually stops you walking for more the about 4 yards? I am able to cope with other aches and pains to a good degree, although I have more bad days than good. I have not yet found a pain-killer that works for me, athough my GP is brilliant.
I would also be interested to know if anyone has tried Acupuncture for pain relief for PMR.

"Hello SES, Have you seen the rheumatologist yet? You said you have an appointment for September..i didn't have pain in my hands, knees and feet like you, just intense pain in the main muscles. As PMR is inflammation of the muscles do you think you have osteo Arthritis as well? You said your sedimentation test was negative mine was an extremely high 97. You are so young to have PMR. I don't know how you are coping with so much pain. Before I went on steroids it could take 15 minutes just to turn over in bed. I am a very reluctant drug taker but I was amazed at how fast they work and how soon they get you back on your feet.
I'm just afraid the darned thing will come back now I am rid of it. Please let us know how you are diagnosed. I just hope things are easier since your first posting. Anabel

"I have been suffering from PMR since November 2006 although it was not diagnosed until the following March 2007. I was prescribed 15mg steroids and within 4 days I had my life back and it was as though it had never happened. I was so full of life and could not stop finding things to work at. At 68 I had more energy than I had ever had. 3 months later my Consultant reduced my intake to 10 mg but the pain recurred and eventually I went on to 12.5 mg. I still felt pain in my hands and wrists and had to wear wrist bands during the day - yet come the evening and during the night I was pain free. I therefore began to experiment and decided to take my steroids in the evening. Magic - it worked - no pain during the day and none noticeable during the evening and night. However - thinking I was the clever one - when I visited my Consultant this month (October 07) he became extremely angry with me and said that I should not have changed the times of taking the steroids and to immediately go back to taking them in the morning. I have done so as he was so emphatic about it - the last two days I have had slightly painful weakened wrists but he said this would eventually go - and he reduced my intake to 11gm. Anybody else take their steroids at difrferent times and to what effect :?:

Between me and my neice I think we've got her back on track again. By the way, travelling long distances on trains and overnight coaches is NO FUN when you have PMR I can assure you. And I'm due to go back again mid October.

However, my last trip to visit my mum (by train) was where I noticed by accident that I could almost run again - trying to find my train carriage which was at the other end of the platform. Okay when I say run I probably mean very gentle jog (of sorts). Anyway it was a boost since previously the saying \""can't run to save my life\"" was ever present especially when crossing busy roads. Over the last couple of weeks my overall pain seems to have stabilised (first two weeks of September). Last week I thought it had started to ease off slightly but the last couple of days it seems to have returned (not to the point of crawling upstairs - haven't done that for about two weeks now - good sign). THOUGHT: Did my pain levels subside because of the time of month? Anyone else noticed anything?
I have been walking more and (a little at a time but often) - despite the pain to see if this helps - and I think it has. The pain in my groin area has definitely subsided. I still struggle to bend down to pick something up and have to get down on my knees, but I can now sometimes bend my legs to crouching position (depending on time of day).
I would like to come down to 1mg soon but I think I'll wait another couple of weeks - just to make sure the pain has stabilised. I am just getting over a very bad dry tickly cold which has caused lots of sleepless nights. The plan is to be free of steroids by the end of the year at the latest. I do not take additional painkillers unless absolutely necessary (and then usually for headaches - not that they work) as I think if I mask the pain I won't know how much I am improving.
THOUGHT: PMR is a blood disorder (raised ESR/CRP) which affects the main muscles by attacking the muscle linings, hence causing inflammation and pain. When the blood levels have returned to normal (ESR/CRP) the muscle linings are no longer being attacked. However, although blood levels have returned to normal, surely it will take time for the muscle linings to repair and heal. Hence, could this be the reason we are still suffering muscle pain long after our blood levels are back to normal and have stopped taking steroids. Anyone agree?
On the subject of running again - have just had another go today and YES, I've improved - I definitely did a short slow run up the garden (mind you it was about 4pm not 9am) but it's a start. At least my lower body is improving.
NB: Does anyone with PMR cycle and, if so, does it help? I've often thought about cycling again and wondered if this could help.
So, to determination, belief and success ...

"Hi folks! My aches/pains started mid January and gradually got worse. Doctor said it was probably a viral infection after flu - never had flu. Got so bad I struggled to get in/out of bed, move in bed, use stairs (even stood by a step for minutes at a time almost scared to step down - felt like a child just learning), couldn't walk, etc - you all know what I mean. I started searching the internet for anything that might match my symptoms - not easy as several possibilities came up. Two months later I contacted NHS24 - they were great and said I should request a blood test when I next saw the doctor. Didn't need to, doctor was ready for me (obviously NHS24 had already been in touch). Anyway, confirmed PMR and was put on 3mg Prednisolone per day (seems low compared to most - don't know why). It has helped but i still waddle when I walk and shoulders and upper arms ache for about 4 to 5 hours afterwards.Then it gets a bit better but if I move my arms the wrong way (stretch, twist) without thinking, I get a piercing sensarion like I've just been stabbed and can't move my arm until the pain subsides. I am also quite depressed but think that's due to frustration because I was previously fit, active and healthy and now struggle and find it an effort to do anything - even find washing painful and difficult to use pressure. Also find I have lots of headaches and paracetamol is useless. Sorry I've gone on a bit but I just needed to get a few things off my chest - to people who understand what I'm going through. Hope someone out there replies. :?

"I was diagnosed with PMR at the age of 46, having struggled with the symptoms for about six months. It was the most frightening thing that has ever happened to me because nothing that the doctor gave me made any difference. The pain was awful. I was unable to get out of bed or get dressed without help from my children. Eventually I was refered to a consultant in Sheffield who took great care to find out what was wrong. After 9 days in hospital, I returned home feeling almost human again and walking freely, without pain. The prednisolone was miraculous and over 18 months, I have managed to reduce the dose from 15mg to 5mg. Pain and muscle weakness returned each time the dose was reduced but after a few days, the pain lessened and eventually disappeared.
Because it is so unusual for people of my age to have PMR, young doctors felt unable to diagnose it inspite of typical symptoms. Sometimes I thought I was going mad, because it would seem to be less of a problem as the day wore on, but come back with a vengence in the early hours of the morning. I would like to meet other younger sufferers if possible - just to see how they are managing their lives.
Thank you for the opportunity to express just a little of my experience.

"P.M.R was confirmed by a specialist 5 months ago. I was in a lot of pain and couldn,t get out of bed because of the pain, I was put on 40grms of prednisolone to start with and have now got it down to 20grm. does anyone out there suffer from chronic cramps in the hands and feet? the muscle cramps go into spasm and I am unable to relax the muscle, I also get a twisting pain around the heart muscle. I dont know if this is part of the P.M.R or something else.
