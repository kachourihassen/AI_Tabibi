"Hello everyone! I'm a 24 year old male. I have tried to avoid covid-19 as much as I could but still got it last year in April. I never got covid in 2020 and 2022.
I got covid during that time because I was travelling in a public transport inspite of wearing mask (cloth) and washing hands. I was also not eligible for vaccines. Now I am double vaxxed (got 2nd dose in Nov 10) waiting for booster.
My symptoms were severe as I had 12 day fever, lung tightness and very low appetite. Many times my oximeter readings started from 91, 92 or 93 but settles at 94 or 95.
I am fed up with precautions. I have to go to college and board public transport. N95 masks are expensive and cannot be reused. Cloth masks don't protect but it is affordable and cheap. I don't want to get seriously ill from covid.
I want to know more efficient precautions against covid-19.

"I believe I caught covid on Thursday 2nd June and started experiencing a runny nose and fatigue on Friday 3rd June. I dismissed it as hayfever so didn't take a LFT until Sunday 5th which was strongly positive. I am now therefore on my 9th full day of symptoms however my LFT's were nearly negative on day 6 and 7, but since then have gotten darker again. I am very confused about this. Should I simply complete my 10 days of isolation regardless of what the LFT test says?

"Very thin and very faint line which can be seen by the naked eye but not sure if this is just what's in place on the test or if it's an actual positive result?
I had the same issue back in January, did a PCR and it came back negative. I feel a bit fatigued and need to test daily for work but does anyone know if this is classed as a positive result or not?

"21yo male, no other conditions, not a smoker. I was diagnosed just yesterday. It all began with weakness, a severe headache, and soon after the fever set in. It's currently 5am on day 3, and the fever has been raging on, constantly. I've been taking at least 3 antipyretics a day because it's unbearable and it makes me extremely miserable, plus the weather here is already very hot. I've been alternating between ibuprofen and soluble paracetamol. Paracetamol works faster but seems to last a little bit less, it also contains a lot of sodium from what i know, ibuprofen takes forever to work (at least 40-50 minutes) but it seemed to last a bit longer, but I've also read it can be hard on the kidneys. I managed to fall asleep through the fever last night (which always peaks at 38.8-39.2), I've been taking my temperature using the oral route under the tongue, and I remember to add the extra 0.4-0.6c. However I woke up an hour ago and even though it kinda seemed to have dropped, it came back up in no time, I couldn't take it any more and took another ibuprofen (400mg). This one didn't seem to work as efficiently as it used to, it took about 50 minutes to work, and my temperature barely dropped below 39, I do feel comfortable enough though. Is it normal for a fever to be constant like this? I mean as soon as the meds start to wear off my temperature skyrockets immediately. This is my first time being infected this bad and I'm worried, I got it from my mother who doesn't have any fever at all.

"I've had covid for I believe 9-10 days, possibly even longer as my ear pain/stuffiness began a few days prior to other symptoms. All of my worse symptoms like aches, chills, sore throat, swollen glands, etc. have subsided and for the last 2 days i've been left with a nose that is constantly running, with some sneezing. Is this normal on day 10? I thought for sure by now I'd be in the clear. I'm going to retest today so I can go to an event this weekend and I'm not confident that I'll be negative. Is it possible my symptoms could even continue to change/worsen more?

"Hello, I had a very mild case of COVID back in early October. About a week or so AFTER I got better I lost about 95% of my sense of smell. My sense of taste was not affected. After a few weeks it started to come back and all seemed fine. Then a couple of weeks ago just after the new year when eating a mint I noticed a very odd chemical taste. Everything else tasted fine. Then a little over a week ago I opened up a peanut butter jar and it smelled horrible. Smelled just like that chemical taste of the mint but 100x worse. Now last week many things have a faint chemical smell. I thought it might be a new detergent or something but my wife swears nothing has changed. It is faint and if I did not suffer from GAD then I probably wouldn't notice it.
The best I have been able to figure out is in very late December I was using some paint stripper, which seems to be very close to the chemical smell, and that somehow my nose wires got crossed. I was in a pretty well ventilated area. When I am outside I do not smell this at all. When I come back in I swear I can smell chemicals but NO ONE else in the house can smell anything.
I do not believe this to be a neurological issue as in late October I had an MRI for other reasons and nothing was discovered.
Have any other people post COVID had issues smelling and tasting chemicals or other odd tastes/smells? If so what did you do to help the issue?
Thanks!

"I've had Covid 3 times since December 2020 and now have an array of different post covid manifestations.
First, I now have Vertigo. It's a common post covid side effect. I was diagnosed with that a couple weeks after having it the first time and still have bouts of it but my Dr. prescribed Meclezine (spelling?) for that which helps greatly with the dizziness and nausea.
A week before I had it the first time I developed these lesions on my feet that looked like red angry blisters. They showed up between my fingers too. It was painful and there were/are days when I can't wear shoes. It disappeared after I recovered from Covid but then reappeared each time I had Covid again (which was 2 more times after the first time)...AND because I am autoimmune anyway, it pops up now when I so much as get the sniffles.
I also have this weird thing that happens to my face. It too happened a week before I had Covid the first time....and spontaneously happens ever since.
First my eyes will become blood shot. Then my face will turn a fiery red like I had been scalded and become so very hot. My face gets puffy...my eyes get puffy...And then the next day it's completely gone. BUT ...the weirdest thing is two weeks later my face will peel like I had literally been burned.
I also get these wicked headaches once in a while and still occasionally have a residual ""brain fog"". There are days too that I feel so fatigued I can barely keep my eyes open.
My Dr. is stumped. He doesn't know what is happening. Here in Tennessee though, Ivermectin is becoming available as an ""over the counter"" medication and I'm going to take it. I truly believe that Covid is still playing ""the mean girl"" inside of my body and the Ivermectin will (hopefully) get rid of it once and for all....If not, who knows how long I'll have to deal with this...

"The only uplift I've had from long covid, was seeing someone else write about their experiences, and I was like, 'finally! someone else knows!' So I'm going to write my experiences and frustrations too, add them to the pile of stuff that's 'out there.'
Since I got covid 4 months ago, I've never been right. I describe it as 'good days' and 'bad days'. For the first couple of months, I would swing between days of heavy-limbed tiredness, irritability, intense thirst and hunger, random headaches that can last all day... aand 'good days' where I was fairly symptom free.
Toward the end of month 3, I had a week, one week of 'good days' and it reminded me what it's like to be me! That shot of regular life feeling was enough for me to really see the difference, it's like night and day. That week of good days was followed by two weeks of bad days, now there's barely a break in the clouds, and I gotta say the symptoms are getting worse.
I'm 49, but through looks/energy/vibe, I've often been taken for being in my mid thirties. Now I feel like I'm in my frakkin' 60s ><
My GP won't actually see me, because they're only taking emergency appointments, and have been for two years now. I called 111, and got a callback from a doctor, who easily diagnosed long covid, only to say I had to get a referral from my GP to the Long Covid Clinic.... which, ofc, I cannot do because my own GP won't take that kind of appointment.
At my work, I asked for a reduction in hours. I worked a lot before, 40-50 hours per week... now it's more like 30-40 per week. But I'm still struggling. i asked for a further hours reduction, but I can't get it. At every level, they say dumb things: My manager, 'you sound like you want to leave.' Her boss: '40 hours goes with your job title, we've done all we can.' His boss, 'yes, let's get you to your GP to see if you're fit for work,' .... well.. that's something else I can't do >< ... aaaand, her boss from Head Office, 'things will seem better when the summer sun comes out.'
I'm trying to cut down eeeevertying that takes effort, so that I can make it through these days, sometimes spending my whole weekend in bed, sleeping/napping/dozing... for the simple reason, that I can't move! I can sit in a chair, but it's .. head tips back, muslces are heavy, there's nothing I can do.... so I end up going back to bed! I arranged with my laundrette to deliver/pick up washing loads, so that I don't have to. The manager of the laundrette was interested in why I wanted this, and I told him about the long covid. He gave me a doubtful look.
I'm draggging myself thru these days. I expected every day.. every week... that this would just clear up... I understand that people have reported 6 months or more, I get that its a marathon. But 4 months in, and the symptoms are getting worse. Now I'm hearing there are lots of people who have had this one or two years, and we dont know if the effects are lifelong in some cases, because we've only got two years of examples to go on.
I climb stairs every Friday morning, I work in a three storey building just on that particular day. Just as I get to the top, I cough, I always do, and I'm coughing up phlem. Proper, yellow/infected level of stuff is coming up. It's the only time I cough powerfully enough to bring stuff up from my lungs... but every week, without fail, I'm getting this sign of infection from my lungs! What is that about!? How can I have a live infection, week after week like that?
There's always an extra drain on my system, I can feel it, adding weight to my limbs, tightening my chest, making my breath and body labour over simply walking, or any kind of activity that was once so easy that the effects of it wouldn't even register on my awareness. Now they leave me worn out.
Even on good days, I'm massively conscious not to overdo things. I've tried exercise to get my body toward fitness quicker, but it takes an entire week to recover from that. Good day + too much activity = loooong string of bad days afterwards.
It's almost intolerable, and yet everyone reacts with shrugs or disbelief. I'm glad there's something of a community for this, damn, finally sane responses!

I am tired a lot and find laying down for a few minutes does help. Does any of this relate to anybody else? Am I going crazy?

"I have had covid for 7 days now. The first day was severe headache and body aches, second day more of the same. Third day, sore throat, night sweats, no sleep. 4th day extremely sore throat, no sleep. and major depression and anxiety. 5th day sore throat night sweats and no sleep, tons of anxiety morning through night. and the 6th day I finally got some rest after a friend gave me some potent CBD's and then I took some Neo Citron to help me sleep. Today I woke up felling the best I have felt since it all began. but then by mid morning anxiety started to creep in again. and ton of brain fog. I now have a headache as I type this. Gaviscon has helped. it seems like the anxiety comes from the gut. I can't eat and have lost 10 pounds so far. It's quite a process to heal from this. I kept hearing about the brain fog but didn't understand what was going on until now that I have it. Does anyone else have this? The anxiety has been the worst and sleeping was very challenging because I jolt awake every time I try and sleep.

"Hi Everyone,
My wife has been struggling with a variety of symptoms ever since receiving the second Pfizer vaccine (October 2021), again after testing positive to Covid (Jan 2022), and again after being a close contact to Covid in April 2022 . Symptoms range from, but usually start in this order on a daily basis;
Leg pain (thigh area, like an electric shock, feels neurological)
Dry eyes, mouth and throat.
All over body aches
Sore head, like she's been hit across the head.
Nausea usually in the evenings, but has happened on occasion in the morning.
Also some feelings of nearly passing out.
Any kind of physical exertion usually worsens symptoms. She constantly needs to rest. Has had every blood test and heart test you can think of. Currently waiting for an appointment with an infections disease doctor. But so far no doctors can help her. She has to manage it on her own with paracetamol and rest.
Any help or ideas on what avenues we should explore would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you!

"Hello all,
I was diagnosed with Covid in mid-August 2021. Overall, I had a fairly easy go of it. It took me a little over 3 weeks to test negative ( I only know this because my place of employment required me to submit a negative test to return to work). Anyway, while I was positive with the virus, my main symptoms were coughing fits, low-grade fever, fatigue, and feelings of anxiety.
Fast forward to now, I'm feeling absolutely horrible. I've had a headache around my left eyebrow/temple area every single day for over a month. Sometimes it's minor and passes quickly, sometimes it's very debilitating and I'm bedridden with a pulsating headache for hours/days. But not a day has gone by where I haven't felt some pressure in my head. Also, occasionally I feel ""twitching"" in my legs, hands and fingers. Feels almost like I'm going to have an anxiety attack.
If it's not a headache or twitching/anxiety bringing me down, it's extreme fatigue. My appetite is also random. Some days I'm not hungry at all and don't eat all day, other days I'm insatiable and can't stop eating. But I haven't had a 100% good day in months.
Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, what are you doing to help alleviate these symptoms? I started taking magnesium oxide supplements for the headaches yesterday, hoping that takes effect soon. I also started drinking ginger tea a few days ago which seems to be helping with the anxiousness. Other than that, I spend most of my time laying in bed trying to relax and hoping I feel better... It's not fun.
Any advice someone can offer will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance

"Hi! I'm a 21 year old man, relatively healthy. As of yesterday I was diagnosed with Covid.
Before this, I had no issue getting or holding erections. But after my diagnosis, it's like no matter what I do, I cannot get hard. I did some research and found that ED can be a side effect of Covid, but this early on, that fast? Every article talks about how it's generally something that's a result of long covid. I can't find any articles saying if this is permanent, or if this is something that will subside as my symptoms begin to go away, or if this is just a symptom due to Covid and not a form of Covid induced ED. Any help or advice or anything would really be appreciated as I am currently really worried. 21 and having ED doesn't sound fun, especially when I'm fully vaccinated and have the booster shot too.

"I’ve had COVID symptoms since August 10th with sinus congestion, chills and a fever. The fever went away in almost a week. Around August 18th I started getting shortness of breath, cough and pain in the chest. I went back to the doctor the end of August due to continued shortness of breath, lots of congestion and chest pain. A chest X-ray was taken at that time, and I had Covid Pneumonia. An EKG was performed and blood work was taken. The EKG was normal and my blood work was normal. The doctor advised me to do saline nasal rinses, take ibuprofen for pain, and monitor my oxygen with a pulse oximeter.
I had a follow up doctor’s appointment a week ago. I was prescribed antibiotics for my sinuses and they took another chest x-ray. The antibiotics have helped clear up my sinus congestion. The X-Ray showed no signs of Covid Pneumonia, but I still have a feeling of suffocation or a lump in my throat, chest pain, and I can barely sleep.
I’m now 6 weeks out and have lots of anxiety. If you have experienced long term issues, could you share your experience? What has helped? Timeline of recovery?

"My wife tested positive 10 days ago. I have been consistently negative. Both of us have the same vaccine (Johnson).
She experienced some rather common symptoms: Mild fever, cough and so on. But on day 5 she lost her sense of smell/taste and around that time she also got this strange sensation in the head.
She is having a hard time describing how it feels, but it is very unpleasant and persistent. It's not a headache as such. She describes it as the feeling of electricity going through her brain. She says she feels almost a bit drunk, and I guess it can be best described as a strange kind of migraine.
Painkillers and NSAIDs seem to make no difference. Caffeine/coffee makes no difference (maybe a bit for the worse). Warm baths make no difference. Walks and fresh air makes no difference (maybe momentarily for the worse). We have also tried e.g. ginger, zinc and Q10 but the symptoms remain the same (but maybe such supplements needs a longer period).
She sleeps well and is able to chat, laugh and perform daily tasks without showing any lack of coordination or competence. But she complains that the feeling in the head is constant, intensely uncomfortable and seemingly unchanging. She says that it's much worse than having a headachend she is willing to do anything to make it stop.
Have anyone experienced something similar? Any recommendations for remedies to try?

"(I haven't been diagnosed with covid. Had all 3 jabs. ) Around March 2020, I had been aware of breathing anomalies, probably going back to January, with restricted full inhalations, and curiously, constant yawning, even when not apparently tired. On a whim, being unable to get tested in the first summer of Covid (2020), I had a BUPA antigen test in September, which proved negative. My breathing anomalies continue to present, along with unpredictable energy levels, and have undergone 2 years of on/off examinations etc. with no causes ascertained. Interested in hearing of similar experience , particularly with the yawning, and how long it takes for antigens to disappear after first catching virus.

"Hi,
I've had Covid19 for 4 weeks and if I had the energy I'd be tearing my hair out.
I've had 2 sets of prohylactic antibiotics to safeguard against bacterial infections, my temperature has been up and down but never higher than 38 the entire illness.
I've had severe neuropathy during the illness and some kind of night seizures accompanying the other more well publicised symptoms that mean my sleep is terrible also.
I went to hospital Day 14 after a week of seriously thinking I'm on death's door and my blood oxygen was good enough to be sent home for follow up at the Covid Hubs where they basically just take temperature, pulse and oxygen levels.
I was prescribed a 2nd course of antibiotics there as my temperature was still up and they are checking in on me every few days.
Meanwhile I am having one better day, then another terrible day, then a better day then a worse day..But 'better' is still bed ridden, just means I can breath well enough and not too dizzy to make myself my own cup of tea, have a shower and engage in some small talk with my family.
Everytime I have a good few hours I think, that must be me getting well now, but no, 4 weeks later and the last 24 hrs my breathlessness has been worse than it was for the previous 5 days..Am about ready to shoot myself.
Is there anyone else that's experienced being so ill with this virus outside of an ICU setting where it's carried on this long?
Even ICU patients are recovering in 3-6weeks .
Cannot understand why I'm not getting well yet.
I have no underlying health issues and I'm in my 30s.
I don't know if I still have Covid or if this is post viral inflammation and fatigue..There is no way of knowing as they are not testing community cases. Every doctor just says it's definitely Covid but I have no idea if I've passed the peak of the illness or if i should still be worried it could get worse.
Just feel it's going on forever.
Be great to know if there's any non hospital stories of people being sick, as in still unable to do a thing this length of time.

"I got Covid last year, was in ICU for almost 4 weeks and on oxygen at 55 liters for most of that time. I did get pneumonia associated with the Covid. I was hospitalized all of August and released early September to go home on 10 liters of oxygen. I finally came off the oxygen in November, did pulmonary rehab and was released to go back to work. It's now early March and when I check my blood oxygen levels with a pulse oximeter I'm still dropping into the high 70's percent-wise. I do recover back to 94% within about 15 seconds.
Does anyone know of anything that can help with the breathing, getting my lungs to heal faster, opening up my airways, getting the alveoli to heal, etc? I've had people recommend inhalers, but I'm unsure of which one to look into, if they'll even work as well. I do try to do some mild cardio (stationary bike) without going crazy so I don't drop into the 70s percent-wise for extended periods of time. I'm at a loss, no one in my region can give me any real answers, which I do understand since Covid is pretty new to the world.
Thank you everyone!

"Finally, seven weeks after getting the Moderna booster, I'm starting to feel more like my normal self. Within 1.5 hours of getting the booster, I was not well slept for the next six days, and when I finally got out of bed, my stomach pain, burning in my esophagus, and mouth and tongue blisters were unbearable. I've been taking gravol and existing on mashed potatoes, ice cream, yogurt, bread, and ginger ale and have lost 4.5 pounds, down from 117.5 to 113. The more weight I lose, obviously, is now causing major fatigue, dizziness, and leg cramps!!! Lots of other symptoms too. My right hand (the booster given in my right arm) swelled at the joints in my wrist, thumb, and index finger. My skin was itchy all day, and my eyes were burning. I haven't been able to do my yoga workout as well. I tried and completely fell over in the squatters lunge twice because my balance is completely whacked out too!!!

"Thanks ahead of time, I desperately need some feedback.
I am a 36yo healthy male. I was positive on 12/02/21 and went through my first recovery after approximately 2 weeks of discomfort. As soon as i recovered i started having upper respiratory symptoms again. Then it became 1 day feeling good, 2 days feeling bad.
Mostly sinus congestion, fatigue, and anxiety/depression. The cycle still has not ended - today is 2/2/22 and still i have this horrible sensation in my throat/sinuses. It feels like severe inflammation or soreness. 4 doctor visits, 1 ER visit, and still no relief.
I have taken steroids, antibiotics, zinc, nasal sprays, more vitamins than i can name here, antacids, and a slew of other failed meds and vitamins. I am at my wits end.
The pain/discomfort seems to be a little better if I am laying down as opposed to standing upright or sitting. Rest helps a little - but i always end up back in the same boat. Doctor tells me my heart and lungs sounds good and that i have a ""little inflammation"" in my throat. It feels like i have a golf ball in there......
**Has anybody experienced this or something similar? What did you do? **
I truly appreciate anyone willing to type a few words......
Your fellow sufferer....

"Since the start of the pandemic, I’ve been cleaning each and every piece of shopping that comes into my house with antibacterial wipes. One wipe in each hand, cleaning every inch of each item. It takes hours to do diligently and it’s mentally exhausting.
Whenever I tell people that this is what I do, they always look at me with eyes that I can see are diagnosing me with OCD. My motivation to continue with these precautions however has come from a number of things.
1: I can’t be vaccinated in spite of desperately wanting to be.
2: I have bronchiectasis, so therefore am especially susceptible to the virus.
3: I am immunocompromised.
I’ve been reading articles saying that it’s no longer necessary to disinfect your shopping; however, in the same breath, these articles that claim to be channelling science also state the importance of hand-washing before and after handling groceries you’ve just purchased. Surely if that’s what the science is saying, it’s also indicating that it’s important to thoroughly clean the items that are making it necessary for you to wash your hands? Surely if the shopping’s dirty enough to make hand-washing a requirement after touching it, it’s dirty enough to requiring cleaning itself?
Also, while the hygiene requirements of shop workers is considered in the scientific findings, what about other factors that could potentially contaminate your food? Would a considered factor be...the lady who walks off the bus with her child, only to then pick them up and stand them in a shopping trolly to walk all over the area your shopping touches in the shoes they’ve walked through vomit and canine excrement in? Can that be quantified into science?
I’d like to know if sanitising shopping is still required - because it seems like it is, but it’s also a huge drain on my life and time resources. Thanks in advanced.

"Within 8 hours of first experiencing symptoms (later confirmed by test as COVID) I began to experience extreme skin sensitivity, similar to a bad sunburn, on much of my skin, especially my abdomen, lower back and upper thighs. It was so sensitive, I was not able to wear a shirt or lie down to sleep (slept in a chair). When the other symptoms (fever, muscle pain, joint pain) began to intensify on days 2 and 3, I started to take extra strength Tylenol (aspirin is contraindicated for me). Within 30 mins of taking 2 of the Tylenol, the sensitivity was gone. Unfortunately, like clockwork, when the 8 hour dose of Tylenol ran out, the sensitivity returned just as strong as before. I am now on day 7 - and - although the other symptoms have rapidly dissipated (using the I-mask+ protocol), the skin issues continue unabated. I have done some research and found this to be a relatively rare symptom of COVID that sometimes spontaneously resolve without treatment - but I have seen no discussion about how to treat this symptom while it persists. At least for me, the answer is: Extra Strength Tylenol every 8 hours.

"Hello,
My boyfriend tested positive for covid (he is symptomatic) last Sunday (1/16). I have tested everyday since and am still negative. We live in the same house, sleep in the same bed and I have not exactly been ""distanced"" from each other. The previous Friday we were with three other people, all of them tested positive as well (assuming we had a server, bartender or were all around the same person that had it). This is not the first time this has happened for me. I have been around at least 10 other people throughout the pandemic that I have later learned, tested positive. I am sure the vaccine has definitely assisted my immune system in fighting off the virus.
Another strange coincidence (or not), is that my brother's girlfriend also contracted the virus and he never got it either.
My question here is, should I assume I have some sort of built-up immunity or antibodies? Maybe I have already had covid without knowing. Is there somewhere in particular that I could donate my blood for research? I would love to do that if anyone knows of anywhere that I could do so. I'm guessing if I do not have the antibodies, maybe something in particular in my DNA or my blood type?
Thank you for any assistance,
Kathryn

"I contracted COVID two times - October 2020 and in April 2021. Ever since then I’ve been dealing with episodes of hypothermia at unexpected times. My body temperature drops as low as 90° Fahrenheit sometimes and during this time I start to lose consciousness. My body feels lethargic, I have high blood pressure and eventually I start sweating. All this episode takes 10-20 minutes, sometimes even longer. This happens post exertion as well as when I’m resting or taking a nap. Indications of these episodes are sweating, dizziness, body ache, and trepidation.
This has affected my lifestyle immensely. I’m only 18 years old. I had these episodes during my final exams as well. I’m also experiencing loss of appetite. Eating heavy or fried foods also cause these episodes. The only thing that helps out is a strong black tea or consuming warm milk or water.
We’ve conducted each and very body test possible, been to numerous doctors and no core problem was ruled out. Basic medication to improve immune system and some antibiotics were prescribed each time and none of it improved my situation. I want to know if anybody else has dealt with a situation like this? What remedies helped them? And if there’s any doctor to help me deal with this specific condition?

"Hi all,
I wanted to put something out there to see if this is happening to anyone else.
For the last 3 weeks I have been testing positive on lateral flow tests. Faint lines, but definitely there. I've done 9 positive lateral flow tests in total and taken 3 PCR tests over this time, all of which came back negative.
To my knowledge I've been lucky enough to completely avoid catching covid so far (touch wood) so I don't think it's something residual hanging on from having had it before, and even if it was and I was just unaware, surely the PCR tests would pick it up?
The lateral flow tests I am continuously testing positive on are the new Flowflex ones. And no, I haven't had any lemon juice before taking them! (I hear that causes false positives!)
I can't find much on the Internet to say other people are experiencing this. I have no symptoms of covid and I'm certain I don't currently have it.
I also don't think it's a dodgy batch of Flowflex tests either, because my husband has used the same ones with a clear negative result.
Am I just defective or is anyone else having the same trouble?

His GP advised him not to take the 2nd Pfizer however could not explain this reaction. He has ever since been fatigued and sleeps most days. He has been to a neurologist, done blood tests and conduction tests and still no solution or explanation for how he feels or the pins and needles. His immunologist suggested no more vaccines for him. His blood tests are good. It's really disappointing as he was a healthy happy person before this Pfizer. I wonder if anyone else out there has had a similar experience?

"I am writing this to talk about COVID-19 vaccinations and why I think everyone should get vaccinated. Personally, I think it is just the responsible thing to do because it not only helps protect you but it also protects those around you. I think people should do it just to look out for their loved ones. Although I understand people do not agree and believe it is unsafe. That is what I am planning to discuss.
People’s fear of the vaccine- that being that it came out too fast and is unsafe- is very understandable; I’m not going to lie, I was very skeptical of it at the beginning. When it first became available to people, I was thinking the same thing I’m sure a lot of people were thinking, such as: how do we know this is safe? It came out way too fast, there is no way they were able to do enough tests on this, they don’t know what the long term effects of this could be. After reading many non-biased and trustworthy articles over the vaccine, I do now believe it is safe and I think everyone should be receiving it. First off, scientists have been working on creating a SARS-CoV vaccine for more than 50 years meaning they have existing data on the structure, genome, and life cycle of this type of virus. In order to create the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), scientists only had to manipulate the S-protein of the SARS-CoV vaccine. Since time was a luxury the world could not afford, scientists all over the world came together to create the COVID-19 vaccine as quickly and safely as possible. Being able to all compare their research on SARS-CoV, made it easier for them to come up with a safe vaccine for that, therefore leading to creating the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
Since scientists have been able to do research and conduct testing SARS-CoV vaccines for the past many years, I believe it shows us that this COVID-19 vaccine actually did not come out too fast. It is the same virus as SARS-CoV, it just has a different S-protein strand which was easy for scientists to manipulate. I truly do believe this vaccine is safe and it is the only way we will be able to get past this. If you believe you’ll be fine if you get the virus because you’re young and healthy then think about others for a second. Sure, you may be fine and it may not affect you, but it will/has affect those around you. We have lost 5.2 million people worldwide to this disease. We need to do everything in our power to stop this disease, and that requires thinking of others before yourself and getting vaccinated.

"Hi All,
For the past couple of years I've enjoyed a beer or two after work every couple of days.
I would drink like I normally do, with no side effects at all. I would always moderate myself and not drink more than 2 beers a day every 2-3 days.
Last month, I tested positive for Covid-19, lost my smell and taste and felt ill over a week but got back on my feet with a bit of fatigue here and there and I thought I got away scot - free.
That was until I drunk a beer a week after I got better and instantly started sneezing, coughing and suffered from a runny nose for two days. I didn't think much of it and continued to drink here and there with the exact same symptoms lingering on for 2 days.
I don't have any food allergies I know of. Ive always enjoyed food with nothing to worry about.
To this day, a month on I can't happily drink beer without a consistent cough, runny nose and sneezing.
I believe this might have to do with covid because the day before I tested positive and felt a bit off, I had a beer with no symptoms.
Does anyone know what might have caused this new allergy/intolerance or what it might be?
I appreciate anyone who takes the time read and respond

"I just wanted to tell my story and theory because everyone I say it to seems to think I’m some sort of drama queen hypochondriac who is obsessed with COVID. Maybe I am. However, I feel maybe I will get a more sympathetic response here. I live in Bristol England in case that’s relevant.
January 2020 my 18 year old daughter was very sick with a constant - every few seconds cough that lasted for days. She hardly ever gets sick. She had a mild fever and had fatigue. My son and I had very mild flu like symptoms. Since then I have had various random symptoms. A really scary episode where my vision and balance went crazy for a few hours followed by quite a few more milder episodes. Shaking and kind of spasms occasionally. My neighbour who I hang out with was taken to hospital a few months later and put on oxygen despite testing negative for COVID 3 times.
A a few months later I had a few days of feeling poorly with more dizzy spells I took a COVID test. Later that day I got the first nosebleed I have ever had. We all assumed I had irritated my nostril with the swab. Result was negative. The nosebleeds became so extreme it was coming out my eyes and I was in A &E many times and eventually admitted as an in patient and ‘fixed’ in the most painful way.
When my daughter went to her first year at Leeds university she had the same kind of episode of illness she had had previously but perhaps more cold like symptoms but still the cough. That week everyone in her tower block were testing positive for COVID.
A month or two ago I went to see my daughter in Leeds as she was experiencing the same kind of illness only this time she had obviously developed tonsillitis and conjunctivitis alongside the coughing /sore throat. Her flatmates were also poorly but not so bad. After staying with her for two days after not having nosebleeds for months I suddenly got one out of the blue and they escalated in severity again. Leeds student accommodation then suddenly became one of the hot spots of covid with flat mate testing positive. The flatmate was one who hadn’t tested positive previously.
Now in Bristol which has recently become a hotspot my neighbour suddenly had uncontrollable shaking followed by a temperature (39.5) but unusually cold hands. His oxygen level was 95. He felt generally unwell and tired but recovered after 24 hours, apart from a very swollen foot. He had been double vaccinated as have I. He had recently played table tennis at a community centre where my friend’s son has just had to isolate as his team leaders had tested positive after playing table tennis in the same room. My neighbour tested negative 3 times. I just had an episode of sudden hot ear and then cheek for a few hours and felt pretty tired. On the same side as my nosebleeds. My children had a weird reoccurrence of mild eczema.
Is this all just coincidence? I’m wondering if we are possibly catching covid again and again - every time our bodies come into contact with it it is doing it’s best to fight it off and thankfully for my family and friends it seems the symptoms are reducing - possibly due to immunity and vaccinations.
I apologise for this long message but I haven’t seen anyone that has been experiencing anything similar and am just really interested if anyone has similar stories of being exposed to covid again and having symptoms and yet testing negative possibly because our bodies are doing so well at fighting it off we don’t have enough virus in us to test positive.
Thanks for listening and I wish you all good health for the future x

"Hello all,
I need some advice for my child.
3-4 weeks ago my partner and I contacted Covid-19. Just as we were coming to the end of our isolation my 4 year old daughter developed hives on her hands and feet which one hive was covering the entire sole of her left foot! After plenty of sleep and immune boosting foods the hives went away and we are now left with itchy red skin on her hands and feet that are pealing a lot. Is there anything we can do to help make this go away? Has anyone else experienced this? Is this related to covid-19?
any help would be much appreciated!

"Hi all,
My husband had his first Covid vaccine back in April and he had the AstraZeneca vaccine.
He was extremely poorly for about 5 days with it, he was struggling with breathing, awful fever, vomiting, unable to eat, not sleeping, struggling to drink and severe aching. We did contact the doctor as he never moans about illness's but he was really really bad with this and the doctor said over the phone this was normal and he would be fine in a week.
He had to cancel all his jobs he had booked in as he couldn't move which hit us financially again after the lockdown. He refused to get his 2nd jab after the way he felt.
I am desperate for him to get his 2nd jab and he said he will only go ahead if its the Phizer vaccine. I have tried to ring up to see if its too late for him to have his 2nd jab and is it possible to have the Phizer but they didn't really know if it was too late. They said they think the 1st jab has probably expired by now and to contact the doctor. I have tried to get a telephone appointment with the doctor but they are refusing to book and appointment and asked me to ring the Covid line but they are asking me to ring the doctor....no one will speak to me and i'm worried with all the cases at the moment, if he gets Covid i will lose him!
Does anyone have any advice if its too late to get a 2nd dose nearly 6 months after the 1st jab?
Or, will they give him a 1st jab again and then a 2nd jab?
Is it possible to have Phizer if he didn't have that the first time as he can't have that again?
Thank you all x

"Hi,
My 12 and 15 year old kids are being offered the Pfizer covid vaccination and I'm not yet convinced how well it has been tested on children in their age group. I'm pro vacinnations and understand there is a benefit to reducing the ability of the virus to mutate by reducing the incubation periods in everyone.
I'm finding it difficult to get hold of any of the official/approved results of the clinical trials that have been carried out and presumably used by the various bodies that have approved it for use.
Does anyone know where I can get hold of the results?

"About a week after my first vaccine shot (pfizer), i developed flu-like symptoms. Sweats, palpitations, exhaustion, shakes, trembling, weakness, severe diarrhea etc. After a week or so, I went to my doctor and we ran blood and stool tests.
I have now been told that my thyroid function is over producing hormones. He called it a hyperthyroid or thyroditis. I swear its due to the covid vaccine, but he assured me it wasn't. I have done some online reading and it seems that i am not alone.
Anyone else having the same issues. I'm terrified that my doctor brushed it off, and wouldnt give me a medical exemption for my second shot, and now I feel like I should have known better.

"Wondering if anyone that had Covid 19 previously has experienced heart pains, chest tightness etc weeks or months after.
By way of background, I am a 28 year old male who contracted Covid back in October, along with my parents who are in their 60s. Thankfully all of our symptoms were mild similar to a seasonal cold and all recovered within around 10 days.
Over the last few days, I have been experiencing acute chest pains in my left side where my heart is. This has come on all of a sudden, prior to covid and even during and after being infected I never experienced this.
The best way I can describe it is a feeling of sudden tension and throbbing around the heart, along with stabbing pains and some shooting pains in my left arm. I have booked a GP appointment as obviously this is slightly alarming, however I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced similar?
My dad who is in his 60s was affected with the exact same problem as myself, albeit a few weeks before.
I'm otherwise fit and healthy and to all intents and purposes this seems to have come out of nowhere.
I'm curious to find out if anyone else has had similar experiences and would welcome feedback from your experiences.
I have been told by NHS consultants that chest pain and heart complications are some of the symptoms that have been identified post Covid, however there's not enough data available so it would be great to hear other people's experiences to hopefully generate a wider evidence base moving forward.
Thanks for reading and keep on moving forward!

"Felt slightly under the weather after spending days with someone with a bad cold. This person tested negative after PCR test so assumed I'd caught the cold but took PCR test the day after just to be sure. Came back positive. Very unexpected given my situation...also didn't have a temperature...had no cough and didn't lose taste or smell. My wife took a PCR test after this and was negative. Two days after my positive PCR test got a supply of Lateral flow tests for my wife to keep testing herself. Out of curiosity I took an LF test and it was negative...given that this was just 2 days after the positive PCR and just 3 days after first symptoms I was puzzled. Took 3 more LF tests and all came back negative. Then 4 days after first PCR I took another PCR which today came back negative!
Logic very strongly tells me I've had a false positive PCR...has anyone had or heard of a similar experience? I don't want to keep self isolating when all logic says I haven't got Covid.

"I was vaccinated with the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) one shot in March 2021, and my wife received the two shot Pfizer vaccine in February and March 2021. I am 50 years old; my wife 28. Both of us no pre-existing health problems; we exercise regularly.
Early June 2021, I tested Covid negative.
Starting around July 10, 2021, I stopped wearing a mask in public, as everyone around me seemed to have stopped too.
Around July 15, 2021, I started feeling some symptoms I thought were related to a cold. Mild cold sweats, inability to get to sleep easily at night, but no fatigue - I continued to go to the gym and exercise hard during this period.
July 17, 2021, I felt some cold sweats during the day, tiny bit of solid phlegm coughed up, very mild cough.
July 20, 2021, I tested Covid positive.
My wife has had similar mild symptoms, starting round July 20, 2021, although she has had no cough, no phlegm, but yes runny nose . (I have not had a runny nose at all.) She too has experienced no fatigue. Must assume that I gave her the Covid, as she has been in contact with no one other than me during this period. I am the only one who has been leaving the house during this period. She hasn't yet actually tested positive, but assume that she has it.
We will both go for a follow up test next week.
My sense of smell and taste not affected.
Her sense of smell only affected, but she thinks it might just be due to nasal congestion.
No fever at any point - my temperature has been around 97.5 F which is normal for me; hers around 98.1 F which is normal for her.
We have isolated and are avoiding contact with anyone since July 18, 2021, other than when I went to take the test July 20th.
We both feel mild mild dizziness if we exert ourselves, similar to trying to exercise with a bacterial cold.
Trying to just rest, eat well, plenty of fluids. Wet sauna / steam room at home to try to sweat the virus out.

"Hi,
My symptoms started 5 days ago with runny nose, headache and fever. I went for the covid test and it came positive. My doctor prescribed a few medicines and these symptoms have gotten better now, though I still feel weakness, loss of taste, lack of hunger and occasional nausea. So, I am still using the medicine. The worrisome part is that I have developed constipation. My GI tract also seems weakened to force anything out. I have not defecated for five days now. So I am only using liquids and juices now. My doctor has prescribed me duphalac (lactulose) which I have taken for two days now, but still nothing. Anyone with the same problem and some advice?

Everything seemed ok. thought maybe just anxiety. but a couple more times as im laying down, my heart will race with some pins n needles feelings on my left side and going to my cheek and chest. its periodic not sure what to think. i was a healthy 49 yr old with no underlying conditions.

So when you do a lateral flow test you report your results to the government website, and then get a text. Firstly how does that prove you are negative as you could simply report a negative when in fact it is positive, and secondly does a text to say they have received your result, really provide enough evidence?

This test came back positive so i booked a PCR test for tuesday, the results came back negative on wednesday morning so i tested the lateral flow again and again it was positive, twice.
I rang track and trace and they told me to isolate for 10 days from the first positive test, I then ordered another home PCR test and sent that away on thursday and got my results today and again negative, but i've had 6 positive lateral flow tests and they're all from different boxes because i had suspicions that maybe it was a dodgy box or something.

However I am also scared that although I have completed the 10 days I could still pass it on to them with us living together. Is it safe to come out of my bedroom and sit in the living room with my mam again? Should I play it safe and stay in my room unless I'm at work? I'm desperate to spend time with her again but terrified I give it to her. The only symptoms I have left are on and off mild headaches, slight cough very rarely and loss of smell and taste although that is gradually coming back.
Has anyone finished their 10 days and then been close to family members and passed it on? Or the opposite, finished the 10 days and been close to family and not passed it on. I'd rather stay in my room another month than give it to my family.

"Hi everyone. For those who have had antibody tests, has anyone had their antibody level increase rather than decrease? I had covid Nov 2020. First antibody test March 2021 said my IgG antibody level was 88, which my Dr. said was high. She recommended I hold off on getting vaccinated because she said the vaccine could make me feel really sick since my antibodies were already high. I recently got a second antibody test, which said my IgG antibody level is now 250. My Dr said she has never seen anyone’s level increase and she had no idea why it would. She said 250 is really high, and that the level for someone who has been vaccinated is usually over 100. She was very surprised but didn’t seem concerned, she just told me to get another test in three months. Just curious if anyone else has had their antibodies go up instead of down. Thank you.

"I'm from another country and sorry if my English is bad.
I'm allergy to NSAIDs ( mild ) and my mom allergic with Amoxicillin ( pretty bad reaction and she also a cancer patient ), we both want to take the covid vaccine but the only option available in my country is AstraZeneca/Covishield. There was a nurse who also allergy to NSAIDs died few hours after taking the first shot so I super scare right now, I don't know if I and my mom should take the vaccine or not. If anyone here has any allergy like us, please give us some advice, thank you .

"I tested positive on a lateral flow test for Covid on saturday 31st July but had zero symptoms at that point. I then did a PCR test on the sunday 1st August which came back positive and therefore got told to isolate until the 10th. I didnt start to have symptoms until monday 2nd and i read somewhere that you should isolate for 10 days from the first day of symptoms. So my question is will i still be safe to stop isolating on the date from my positive test or should i count 10 days from the first day i got symptoms? Thank you for taking the time to read, I live with my mam and brother and I'm terrified if i stop isolating too early that i give it to them!

"I tested positive for Covid at the start of July and completed my isolation. A few days later I was asked to go for my second pfizer jab. I found conflicting information regarding wait times for getting the vaccine after having covid so decided to book my appointment and find out for definite when I went.
At my appointment the nurse said it would be fine so I went ahead. It wasn't until I started feeling really unwell over the next week that I found out the official guidance was to wait 4 weeks after your positive test. It was only 2 weeks and 4 days after my positive test that I had the vaccine so I am now concerned that having it too soon might result in health problems.
Is it actually dangerous to have the vaccine too close to a covid infection or has it just been put in place so that covid symptoms and vaccine side effects won't be confused?

"Hi,
Our younger daughter tested positive for Covid on 22nd July and completed her isolation period yesterday. I tested positive on 29th July and and am in isolation. My wife and elder daughter prepared food for us while we were isolating. Now my wife has tested positive today although we were taking all the precautions - like using separate Bathrooms, eating separately, wearing a mask etc. Our elder one is still negative.
We would really appreciate if we an get advice on how we should go about isolating in the house now. Can my younger daughter catch the virus again? Should I be isolating from my wife ?
Thanks in advance

"My 15 year old granddaughter we think had covid at the end of December. She has been perfectly fine up until about two weeks ago. She played cricket on one of the hottest days of the year and when she became unwell we thought it was that which caused the lack of appetite and fatigue. we now find that she rallies for a time but then relapses. she had a pcr test to go on holiday first of all which came back inconclusive and the second negative. has anyone had an experience like this with Covid or am i barking up the wrong tree. A blood test has ruled out some things but they are waiting for the results of others. I just wonder if the pcr test was wrong and indeed if she is having a second bout of Covid.

"Hi all
I had read (on the internet take that with a grain of salt) that the use of Fluvoxamine is helpful for Covid or not to get a bad case. I had Covid last year and Thank G-D it was a mild case. I was also on 20 mg of Citalopram at the time. Since Fluvoxamine is in the same class of drug (SSRI) I was wondering if any of you out there are taking Citalopram and what was your experience with Corvid? Did you get it while on this medication? Was it a mild case?
Thanks for all your responses!

"I got my AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday.
I had no immediate allergic reaction to it. By Saturday's early morning I woke up with a fever, so I took paracetamol, later in the day fever came back so I took another pill and so on and so forth, took 3 pills in total.
By Saturday afternoon I noticed 2 spots on my leg and my stomach that appeared to be an allergic reaction, or maybe bug bites, they have since disappeared.
On Sunday I noticed 2 new spots near my vaccination spot on my left arm, along with other smaller spots I guess are called hives. The spots are itchy but mostly on contact.
I also noticed something very weird since it had never happened to me before, some kind of white spots that look like something dried up, at first it made me think of dried yogurt, but obviously it's not the case, they aren't itchy or painful, and one of them actually was removed with water gentle rubbing.
Is this a reaction to the vaccine? I'm not sure if I should see a doctor for this or if it's even related to the vaccine, but I have not eaten or been in contact with anything new either.

"hi all, ive had both my vaccines ( Astra zeneca) - my second one was twenty something of June.
On Saturday i got what i thought was my seasonal bout of heyfeaver. eyes streaming and sneezing constantly. monday as normal i had temperature checked at work (all fine) still sneezing a lot. by Monday night i had a bit of a runny nose. Tuesday my cold continued - just sneezing and runny nose - nothing else. My boss said - do a lateral flow just to be on the safe side - it came up positive!!!
went home inmediately. did another and also positive.
wednesday had runny nose and sneezing all day. felt absokutelt fine. by 5pmish all my sense of taste and smell gone. great!
wake up today and still positive on lateral flow. nose no longer runny - just a bit blocked. sneezing now and again. but i cant taste or smell anything.
im still in shock i have covid after vaccine. i feel so guilty - obviously off work for sometime now but i feel absolutely fine. obviously i will obey all rules. guessing it hasnt hit me as much because of vaccines. just i know ive been to work with worst colds.
my question is - anyone else had covid as light touch as this? do tou know how long it took to be clear?
how long does this awful loss of taste and smell last for. i feel completely fit and well except for sneezing and this lack of smell / taste.
started Saturday with sneezes so guessing i would have tested positive then. so... this would be day six for me.

"I made an appointment for my second shot of the Pfizer covid vaccine and I'm a little nervous based on what I'm hearing in relation to heart inflammation that may happen as a result.
For some context, I'm a mid/late thirties male, I don't have any known health issues, I have a healthy BMI and have always maintained an exercise regimen (mostly running 3 times a week) to stay reasonably fit. I don't smoke and very rarely drink. I have never had any cardio health issues.
I had my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine almost 8 weeks ago and it went well- I basically had no symptoms that I can recall. My arm didn't even get sore- the only time I would feel pain in my arm is if I fully extended it in front me, and even then it was very mild. I think I was a bit ""fatigued"" at the end of the same day- but I'm not even sure that it was a result of the vaccine. I do suffer from intermittent bouts of insomnia which may have caused it; not sure. The fatigue didn't have ""different feel"" about it.
So essentially what I'm asking is- can I ""estimate"" how my body will react to the second dose, given how it reacted to first dose? Since my body reacted ""well"" to the first dose (no problems)- do I have a ""better"" chance at having no adverse reactions (i.e. heart inflammation) when I get my second dose?

In 4 days, they injected 4 injections to me and I started to get better. My oxygen reached 88 in 10 days. My doctor gave me Rivaroxaban for 30 days and my D dimers got better.
Doctor said you had ARDS.

2- Did clots produce due to COVID or ARDS?
3- Once clots finishes, can they become again?
4- Once ARDS finishes, can it happen again in life without any reason and is it treatable?
5- For what they used Actemra Injection for me?
I would be grateful if someone gives me answer and clear my concept.

"Hello everyone,
I am from Holland and I am looking for some information and reassurance. In my own country I can't seem to find any information.
Currently, the Astrazeneca, J&J, Pfizer and Moderna vaccine are widely discussed in the news. These could potentially have rare side effects and cause clots and low platelets.
I have had severe HELLP syndrome. This is also a rare serious disease that occurs in only 02, up to 0.6 percent of all pregnant women and also causes low platelets and clots. My body is therefore certainly able to cause this immune response, partly by non-body substances (half of the DNA is from the partner). This is something I never hope to experience again. And I am now terribly afraid of being vaccinated with 1 of these vaccines. Although I would very much like this partly because I belong to the risk group with asthma.
Are there any women here who have had pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome who have already been vaccinated? And have you experienced any side effects?

"So back in 2019 , it was just me and my mom at home. My brother was working out of town. Mom is a Nurse at a private hospital. So around june she contracted Swine Flu and 3 days after she started showing symptoms, i also started having the signs. We ended up going being treated accordingly since i believe the doctor did suspect it was Influenza H1N1 before we even got our test results but they did give us a serum of some sort. The symptoms instantly started to die down.
Getting to my question, my brother now currently with us at home was diagnosed with Covid 19 on Thursday so we have been social distancing accordingly at home and taking necessary precautions. But i feel that prior to his diagnosis, we were sort of in contact with him but me and my mom have not felt any symptoms at all as of yet. Hence why i ask, is it possible to have gained some sort of immunity to the Covid-19 symptoms after being treated for Influenza H1n1 Type A back in 2019?

(cue health anxiety kicking in and econsult to the doctor) by the Monday (9 days after) I felt another small lymph node above my collar bone and on Monday night noticed a large red raised patch which was tender around the injection site.
I have seen the doc who believes the red patch is a late reaction to the vaccine and the lower lymph node he says he believes is a tendon not a node. He said he will refer me for a scan on the other node just to make sure.
Did anyone else get enlarged lymph nodes after their vaccine, more than a week later?
Also, I'm not so sure there is a tendon below the collarbone so that's freaking me out too!!!

"i had a relatively mild Covid experience, very fatigued and it affected my chest/breathing but didn't need any medical care.
since then, i have experienced a range of symptoms less common to the ones we see every day. ive listed them below in order that they came and went
ache in my arm (lasted a week)
trouble sleeping (lasted a month)
shaking (was very rare)
tingling in my feet and legs (lasted a few weeks)
neuropathy (warm, tingling feet mainly at night and this lasted around 7 weeks)
Muscle twitches (ive had these for 5 weeks and counting)
all this is having a real impact on my mental health, im not sure if its long covid of if its anxiety as i have struggled mentally to deal with these symptoms. many of them are symptoms of other serious neurological issues and thats worrying me.
has anyone had anything similar with any advice?
Thanks

"Over the past few months I have been suffering with most if not all of the typical long covid symptoms. I just had a telephone conversation with a doctor who has told me that because I was not tested for covid19 and found to be infected and because I was not tested for covid antibodies before I received my first vaccination injection that I cannot be considered to be a long covid sufferer and therefore would not be accepted by a long covid clinic. Is this correct ?

"Hi, first-timer here. I would like to ask for second opinions on behalf of my mother.
Does the risks of VITT from the AstraZeneca vaccine increase in people who had prior Ischemic Strokes? In this case, it was in the brain and treated with anti-clotting vaccination and medicine (don't know the names).
On a side note, if someone had the Sinopharm vaccine as the first dose, and could only get the AstraZeneca vaccine as the second, should the interval be 4 or 12 weeks?

"Hello everyone,
This is my first post, so please excuse my mistakes.
I've recovered from covid, more than a month ago. My PCR test is negative.
My employers asked me to do an anti-body blood test. The result was both IgM and IgG as positive. They have asked me to continue working from home until my IgM is negative. Another colleague who also got sick from covid has joined work again because his IgM level is negative now as well as PCR test.
My question is, if my IgM (short term immunity) is not coming down mean, I still have some virus remaining in my system. Also what can I do to reduce IgM levels so that I can go back to work again.
IgM = 28.9, IgG = 42.83 June 7 2021
IgM = 16.2, IgG = 47.02 May 31 2021
IgM = 15.1, IgG = 6.8 May 15 2021
I will appreciate any help and guidance.
Best regards,

"I am sending to check if there is any one faced similar symptoms or know more than I do so that you can somehow guide me.
In the mid of 2019 I started having very cold hands before lunch time that I can't work. I went to do blood test and I was asked to take vitamins which didn't do any change.
Then In had the symptoms of corona in the 23 of march 2020,
1st day: Shivering, headache, diarrhea, couldn't eat
2nd day: sorethroat at mid day, couldn't eat
3rd day: started eating, sorethroat ended at mid day, blocked nose at night with lump in throat (solved the blocked nose with spray o.w I wouldn't breath)
4th day: same as 3rd day
I wasn't eligible for test so I had to stay only at home. After these 4 days and I started feeling progress, then I suddenly noticed
breathing problems after lunch only.
A lot of burping,
dead skin around my nose
needles feeling in my chest
Frequent red itchy skin at the lymphoid gland area as well as red itchy skin on the esophagus area
Can't talk a lot or shout as I feel sensitive in my throat
In June my esophagus was so inflamed that after touching the area of lymphoid gland, I had a fast heart beat and I went to do corona test which came negative. I went to the doctor who doubted that I have reflux and after trying Proton pump inhibitors for two weeks nothing changed and then he asked me to do a spectroscopy and we found nothing. Strangely that I found a friend of a friend that had the same symptoms but she even had blood coming from her throat. She did the spectroscopy and found that it was Helicobacter Pylori is the reason. My doctor simply told me, don't be scared because it seems to be a psychological problem.
I read online to see life habits to decrease the effect of reflux and what really made a difference was to avoid sitting in the bed before sleeping. That removed the most harsh symptom of breathing problems after lunch. Yet I went on with a lot of burping, daily dead skin around my nose and needles feeling in my chest and around every 3 weeks to have red itchy skin over lymphoid and esophagus.
Now that a year has passed and I am still having the same symptoms plus frequent numbness in the back of my feet and my feet nails is getting destroyed. I have read in a publication that Helicobacter pylori bacteria increases the ace 2 receptors which covid19 use as a host cell and another paper today that Helicobacter pylori is the reason behind lymphoid gland problems.
Does anyone facing the same problems or something similar, know any extra information that I might be missing or have advice?

"I got the 1st dose of Moderna's covid vaccine 28 days ago and had a sore arm for 4 days. It hurt alot. I had difficulty raising my arm. I also felt a bit tired. The tiredness disappeared after 24 hours.
1 day ago, I got my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine and this time after the vaccine I took 2 extra strength Tylenol as I heard that the symptoms are much worse. However my arm didn't hurt as much although it did hurt. I did feel a very slight case of chills that night. I also felt aches and pains the next day and my arm was swollen. I took 2 tylenol every 6 hours for a total of 4 times. On the last dose, my arm pain almost completely disappeared and I pretty much felt back to normal about 28 hours after receiving the 2nd dose.
Not bad and certainly not as bad as some vaccine reaction stories I've hear from others. I would also say that my experience seems to confirm that the 2nd dose can elicit a bit more or stronger reactions than the 1st dose.
GET THE VACCINE AS SOON AS YOU CAN! I feel relieved now that I've had my 2nd dose and glad that I will be contributing to achieving herd immunity.

"Hi
I have a friend with type 2 diabetes and they have just had their 2nd jab (the Oxford/AstraZenica one). It's about 12 hours since they had their jab and they have told me that they have developed diarrhea. They don't know if that is caused by the vaccine or because they drank some water which I gave them and I did not realise until afterwards that the water bottle they used all day was visibly dirty with grime.
I would like to know if diarrhea will affect their body's ability to process the vaccine. I have tried to find the answer on the internet but there are a lot of sites and none seem to cover things which could reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.
So can anyone help me understand the issues that diarrhea will cause?

12 Dec 2020 - 1st Sinopharm dose (taken- no side effects)
mid Jan 2021 - 2nd Sinopharm dose (taken- no side effects)
24 Apr 2021 - 1st Pfizer dose (yet to be taken)
15 May 2021 - 2nd Pfizer dose (yet to be taken)
Would there be any obvious issues/risks with going forward with this plan? (I have heard there would be increased risk of blood clotting)
Would waiting 6 months between my 2nd Sinopharm and 1st Pfizer dose mitigate side-effects?

"Prior to the vaccine, there were absurd characterizations of Covid-19 being comparable to seasonal flu. Now with the vaccine, it looks like the transmissibility -- for the vaccinated -- and the likely severity of infection for the vaccinated may really be comparable to the flu. We are getting some idea of those 2 aspects for Covid-19, but are there corresponding measures for the flu, for people who get flu shots?
I can find numbers relating to, like, the R0 for the flu in the general U.S. population (in which about 50% get vaccinated) and stats for cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the general population, but are there corresponding numbers for people who have gotten flu shots?

So do we have some good idea of what the worst plausible case of Covid would be like for someone who has been fully vaccinated? Apparently it wouldn't rise to the level of what the CDC considers ""severe disease"". For someone without complicating factors, are we talking about something like a bad bout of seasonal flu, with no lingering effects?

"Okay so a bit about my family.
My husband works at IT, he got his first dose of the vaccine, as did I, and we are waiting for our 2nd. (I am a stay at home mother.) We have a 4 year old daughter and an almost 1 year old who has an SVT since 2 months old.
We have been practically in a bubble. My husband works (masks required) and we do get groceries once a month (usually we do grocery pick up but we are on WIC so we do stop once a month to get WIC items.) The only people we have seen since this all began are my parents, who take it VERY serious, and my SIL, who also does.
My parents have been fully vaccinated (yay) now, but now that they have been, my sisters family will be visiting them every now and then. My sister's family does not take it serious at all, refuses to vaccinate or wear masks or social distance.
We know that there IS a possibility of spreading it even after being fully vaccinated, so we aren't sure how long we should stay away from my parents when they visit my sisters family.
I talked to her pediatrician and she had said it was ""up to us"" on how we felt.. either wait 2 weeks, or wait a week and see if they have symptoms.
The WIC clinic told me that it was ""very rare for someone vaccinated to pass it on"" and that we ""probably didn't have to worry"".
But others have told me not to risk it and do a full 2 week of distancing from them.
So I'm confused now. It'll be a week, Saturday, since my parents have seen my sisters family. They have some health problems unrelated to covid (they both had had covid tests before this as they have had to go to the hospitals a few times for testing to see what's going on) but they have no covid symptoms.
Should we still quarantine another week with no contact, should we see them but have them wear masks (they have said they would if we wanted them to), or is it safe enough, since they are fully vaccinated and have been very careful for a week with no symptoms, to see them?
I know covid isn't as likely to be dangerous for children, but since our daughter had a heart condition (which we can thankfully say she has not had an episode since October now! but back in June-July it spiked her heart rate due to a simple fever she got) we have been scared to let anyone near the household.
My parents are our only outlet, so we're hoping we will be able to see them sooner, but I will do whatever is safest for our kids too.

I haven't heard of this symptom, could there be an underlying problem with my lungs that I don't know about? anyone else have this?
Thank you

"Hello, on 4th Dec i was tested positive for covid since then it has been a rollercoaster to battle the virus. I have been experiencing many symptoms nasal congestion, headache, sneezing, chest pains, pressure on chest, neck shoulders, upset stomach, loss of smell and taste, sore throat almost like tonsillitis symptoms lots of phlegm,slight dizziness and nose breathing difficulty sensations for 3 weeks now. Will these symptoms eventually ease or is it always ongoing? What is the best thing to help tonsillitis symptoms? Has anybody experience similar symptoms do you have any suggested medication that might help relieve some symptoms?

"I am a healthcare worker and just found out that I took care of a Covid positive patient for two days prior to them being tested and finding out they were positive. Therefore, I was unable to wear the proper PPE to prevent exposure. Luckily, I have already had the two Pfizer vaccines about two months ago. I scheduled an upcoming flight this Friday, but i am worried there is still a chance I could carry covid. I did schedule a rapid covid test the day before my flight. Does anyone have any orher suggestions or thoughts? I am just worried!

Can someone take what a diabetic is allowed to take while having covid?
what painkillers, what pills, what medications to reduce temperature
The answer to this question seems to be a mystery, there is lots of contradicting online contradictions, medicine companies tell you to contact the doctors, most of doctors never read leaflets, tell you to contact info line, infoline does not tell you anything and tell you to ask doctors etc

"Hello all. I came down with Covid symptoms more than two weeks ago on February 19th/20th and tested positive February 22. I quarantined for 2 weeks although the CDC recommends a minimum of 10 days from the first day of symptoms for people who test positive. I am 35 in decent health and my symptons were minor aches and fever for about the first 3-4 days with slight dizziness and headaches off and on for about 7-8 days. I have been feeling normal for more than a week.
However, my issue is that today I was at a friends to look at a window that needs a blind repaired. When I was leaving we talked for a few minutes and I mentioned that I had tested positive but had also quarantined for the 14 days instead of the 10 recommended by the CDC. Unfortunately she was very upset that I even came by and didn't tell her first. She was also bothered that I would even be out in the first place. I did wear a mask the entire time and maintained distance as well. She is only around 30 years old although she has had some health problems.
I am not really sure what to do or how to respond to all of her angry texts that she has been sending me from panic even though I explained that I was careful to quarantine for longer than required and also that I am feeling fine. Honestly I feel that we won't return to normal for a long time and that people won't trust anyone again.
Just looking for thoughts on what to do for this situation and what to do for future situations.

"mRNA vaccines work by providing the genetic code for our cells to produce viral proteins. Once the proteins, which don’t cause disease, are produced, the body launches an immune response against the virus, enabling the person to develop immunity.
Question 1: the proteins are produced by cells that presumably go on to replicate, with the mRNA changes incorporated in their replications. Then the replicated cells produce more viral proteins, which our immune system will presumably attack. What happens when the number of modified cells is producing enough viral protein to overwhelm the immune system?
Question 2: Why does the body launch an immune response to something that is produced by our cells? Why does it not recognise that the viral proteins are produced internally, and so should not be attacked?
Question 3: If the immune system is attacking viral protein, what will it do when it sees, not just the “spike”, but the whole virus?
Question 4: What will happen when someone who has had the vaccine, and so is producing viral protein, is trying to conceive a child with someone who hasn’t had the vaccine, so may recognise the other person’s sex cells as “foreign” and attack them?
Is there a doctor in the house? I'd really like to understand the way things work

"After testing positive on Feb 9, I finally tested negative and showed antibodies on Feb 22, 4 days ago.
I have gone back to my activities which mean staying at my desk for several hours.
Earlier today I had just gone down and up the stairs at work, and within minutes of sitting down again I felt a sudden sharp pain in my right calf. It had never happened before and I didn't hurt myself or anything like that. Then I also started experiencing a slight feeling of warmth, not really on the whole leg but my foot feels warm.
Minutes later I also felt another jolt of pain close to the arch my foot.
A week ago I had a couple of blood tests to check for anything odd, my D Dimer levels were both times within range, and it actually went down by a single digit the second time. My doctor checked it all and said they were fine and since they weren't increasing it wasn't a problem.
I don't notice any swelling so far and the leg isn't painful to the touch, I actually haven't felt the pain since that one time. Although it does feel slightly weird, like loose but not really, and like I said the calf isn't painful any more.
Could these be DVT symptoms almost a week after getting better of Covid, and with 2 previous blood tests showing no sign of coagulation problems?
Or is this just a bad coincidence?

"Hi all,
Thought I would pop on here to share my experience of Covid. I'll bulletpoint to keep it simple.
*14th&15th Dec, I was in contact with someone who tested positive for covid (they tested positive on the 16th)
*21st Dec - experienced sharp shooting pains all over my body - not constant and did not interfere with daily activities.
23rd Dec - feeling extremely tired but didn't interfere with daily activities, minor loss of taste.
24th Dec - still tired, sharp pains gone. Felt like I had small blobs of phlegm stuck in my throat - not low enough to cough up and not high enough to blow out nose. Not very hungry.
25th Dec - the person I was in contact with passed away. (he DID have numerous underlying health conditions and sepsis from a UTI). Ability to smell and taste things 90% gone.
28th Dec - go for a test. Feeling tired and breathless - this was thankfully minor and manageable. OK when I sit in the warm.
29th Dec - Positive result. I felt so so scared. I live in a with my Fiance and his mum. We are all in separate rooms - isolating. Never felt so alone and scared.
30th Dec to 2nd Jan - every night, going to bed anxious. Scared of getting worse, scared incase I have the same fate as the friend we lost. Weird dreams about food and craving food! Taste and smell came back over these days to about 80%. Breathlessness getting better but still taking it easy and listening to my body.
3rd Jan - developed 1 patch of rash. The 'Herald spot' for pityriasis rosea (confirmed by a DR)
Recovering day by day.
21/01/21 - I am back at work as of a couple weeks ago. Still feel like I have hayfever every now and then. Managed to go for a small run last weekend (Usually run 5k at least twice a week) - went better than I thought. I still have the rash and the sharp shooting pains have come back and bite every now and then.
I must admit the worst experience of it all for me was the anxiety that came with it. You only hear and see negatives on the news and after my friend passing, it was really hard to think I would get off lightly.
I'm still not 100% but I am hoping that as time goes by, I will gradually get back to my normal self. Time will tell I guess.
If anyone wants to ask me anything etc, please let me know. Happy to help anyone if I can from my experience.

"My mother detected covid positive on 12th nov. She was administered Remdesivir and some other meds and antibiotics and everything was fine for initial 11 days. On Day 12, she felt more than usual fatigue and on checking temperature, there was low grade fever. Dr recommended some blood work and on the results and some infection markers, he advised hospitalisation for better monitoring and administration of some more antibiotics. she was admitted on nov 22. everything was well till nov 23. on nov 24, oxygen saturation was bit low (92-94) and so she was started on 2 litre oxygen. However, by evening she was on 12 litres and by next day 15 litres. On morning of nov 26, she was moved to ICU after saturation dropped to 83. as of 27 nov, she is on high flow oxygen 20 litres. Can anyone suggest if they have seen similar case or have a similar experience. Please share recovery experience and timeline. As per blood work, infection is coming down.

"So on Monday this week my COVID test results came back positive. I never really had any major symptoms apart from a stuffy nose and a mild cough but I did notice on the Tuesday morning that I was slowly losing my sense of smell and taste. Later that night it went away completely. It's now Sunday evening and it still has not returned, not even slightly. For those who have also experienced or are currently experiencing the same thing, it's terrifying and confusing but more so if you're a bit of a comfort eater and love the taste of food. My self isolation period ends on Wednesday next week. Can somebody please tell me how long it'll take for my senses to return or if they never will? That's the thing I'm so scared about and it's sort of made my anxiety and depression much worse than it normally is! Many thanks in advance.

"I have lots of allergies to various things like foods, chemicals, latex, penicillin, etc which have resulted in itchy skin or mouth, swelling of lips and face and breathlessness. I also have ME/Chronic fatigue syndrome which means if I caught Covid it is likely I could be severely affected by it so would prefer to have to vaccine if possible but am very unsure how safe it would be to get the vaccine given my allergies. My doctor said I might or might not be able to have it which is not helpful. Has anyone else with allergies had the vaccine and felt OK with it? I would also urge anyone on here who has long Covid to look up ME/CFS as the symptoms are very similar and you might find things such as pacing, setting very small goals, diet, supplements, etc to be helpful in seeing an improvement in your symptoms.

"So I tested positive on Feb 9, since then all my symptoms have improved significantly, basically all I have is a lingering cough that doesn't bother me too much.
I was last seen by my doctor on Tuesday and my second blood tests were also improving, so I was told everything seemed fine.
But since Wednesday I started getting headaches that I believe have gotten stronger, the first 2 days they happened during the afternoon, today it started shortly after waking up.
Earlier today I also noticed a sudden nasal discharge, clear liquid, coming out of both sides for a moment, although I want to believe it was due to the food I had just eaten.
Could this be due to some kind of brain inflammation? Or due to recent physical or sexual activity since this is how the first headache started?
Or is this all just a coincidence?

"Hey guys!
Im a nursery teacher and am currently waiting on the results of a covid test to see if i have it.
My symptoms started with a terrible sore throat then progressing to tiredness and a ridiculous amount of sneezing and nasal congestion.
I have suffered mild body aches and nausea with has led to me not really wanting to eat much.
Just as of today (day 3) I have noticed a change in my sense of smell however i can still taste fine.
Could easily be a cold as i have suffered no cough and my temperature at its highest was only 37.4 which is very low grade.
Just wondered if this is what other people experienced with mild covid or if its more likely a cold as the wait to find out is driving me insane!
Thanks all.

"So I should be on day 14 since symptoms onset today, and while I feel like I did experience every single symptom there is, I never experienced shortness of breath, at least I think so.
I had my second blood tests done yesterday which confirmed DDimer and Fibrinogen levels are still or went back into their appropriate ranges, C-Reactive Protein went down almost within its range as well. So far Ferritin is the only one that has gone up, up to twice its max value actually, currently at 500.61 ng/ml, max should be about 275, 3 days before it was at **338.5 ng/ml ** so that's a significant increase too as far as I can tell. I haven't heard back from my doctor yet. But as far as I've seen this goes up when there is immune system hyper inflammation, which can cause serious problems.
Since last night and until today I have felt as if my chest is heavier than usual, if I try a deep breath it feels as if I have something on me causing pressure, or like very tight constricting clothing.
My blood oxygen levels are normal, they range between 98% - 100%. Everytime I have been checked out by my doctor I have no problem reaching 100% either.
Blood pressure is also fine, heart beat rate is fine, 60 - 90 depending on the situation.
So my question is, since most markers are fine, except for that one, could this be considered a bad indicator? Is this really what shortness of breath feels like? Or just some anxiety induced fear symptom that I'm getting?
I feel like it would be too easy to blame it on axiety, especially since the risk is real given that most Covid related deaths happen in the immune response stage I'm in.

"Since testing positive last Tuesday, almost a week ago, most of my symptoms have settled down.
I no longer have a fever or headaches and my taste is back along with most of my smell. Basically the only symptom is that I keep coughing every now and then. All in all I feel fine.
I should be on day 11 since symptoms onset this Sunday, and on Saturday, day 10, my doctor had me do some blood tests to see how I'm doing internally.
We reviewed them today and they weren't very good. I had high fibrinogen levels (634.3 mg/dL, range should be 250-600), high ferritin levels (338.5 ng/ml, range should be 21-274), high globular sedimentation rate (31 mm/hr, range should be 0-15), highC-Reactive Protein (1.31 mg/dL, range should be 0-0.5), among other values.
Dimer-D was high but within range (245 ng/ml, range should be 0-255).
I was basically told this was expected given the Covid infection, but that it still raised my chance of very severe complications like 100 times.
My doctor said we weren't going to try anything just yet, I'm getting a new blood test next Tuesday, 3 days after the first one to see if things are improving and if so we're gonna leave it alone. But if they stay the same or God forbid get worse, then we're gonna try some real deal medications like blood thinners and such.
So what I expected was gonna be a good visit to the doctor since, like I said, I feel fine, turned out to be literally heartbreaking, knowing I have inner inflammation, my blood is thickening and who knows what else.
Is all this normal? Has this been observed on others that you know of? How has it progressed? What can I expect? I'm crying.

"I received my first vaccination today at a large centre. I was nervous about going to the centre and encountering a lot of people at close quarters. I entered the building wearing a brand new FFP3 respirator (N99) which I had bought purely for this visit. A staff member immediately asked me to remove my mask and replace it with one of theirs which was one of these (useless) blue surgical masks. I was somewhat stunned by this. Needless to say there was no way I was going to comply and I was quite prepared to go home if necessary. Eventually after some discussion a doctor was called and she said my mask was the best available and there was no problem. A second doctor then requested me to wear a blue surgical mask over mine. I did not object to this since I could see that his intention was to give the impression of uniformity. All proceeded well until I eventually got to the vaccination station. There were four or five staff sitting as close together as it was possible to be. There was also a seat for me right next to them where I was requested to sit while they prepared the vaccine. I declined and said I would prefer to maintain a 2 metre distance except when the vaccine was being given. The staff members didn't seem to understand why I was reluctant to sit near them! Thank goodness I had a decent mask on. I later complained to NHS Healthwatch and subsequently received a reply from the centre supervisor saying ""I am very disappointed to hear of your experience. Only this morning I gave a briefing to all the staff regarding the importance of social distancing"". He also said he would look into this further. From what I have seen on TV, my experience is far from unique. What on earth is wrong with people when even the medics at the nerve centre can't comply with the most basic regulations.

"I'm currently waiting on my second PCR test results which I should get later today, first one was a week ago and negative. I have experienced lots of symptoms, from fever, to headache, to sore throat and most recently cough. But late last night I became aware of a new symptom that worried me a big deal. I was feeling a bit of nasal congestion, so I decided to take a hot shower thinking that would help. Once I was in I started to feel uneasy, I suddenly realized my heart was beating faster than usual, I could both see and feel the beats as it went on, so the relaxing hot shower I had in mind had to be cut anxiously fast. Once I was out I checked my bpm rate and it had gone up to 130 beats per minute, it actually reached up 132 only to then come back to the 120 range. My usual rate was about 70 bpm, but since I've developed symptoms it began to stay in the 90 range, high but apparently still ""normal"". So what I did was to lie down and try to ""relax"", I closed my eyes and started listening to music but the heart beat wouldn't move below 115 bpm. As I said I'm currently waiting on my test results but is this something that has happened to you? I'm worried it might be dangerous.

"Hi all,
My 78 year old mom tested covid positive nov 13, 20 days ago. She had mild symptoms - body ache, cough but never had a fever or needed O2.
She is currently in a rehab facility, was originally in for an infection (before covid) but was well enough to come home, then caught covid. Before covid she cold walk 35+ feet with her walker, did all of her exercises and could do her toiletries.
Now she has trouble walking more than a few feet and only gets out of bed every couple of days.
What's worrying me though is the ""brain fog"" thing. Before covid she was lucid and mentally sharp - ready to come home. Now she has ""blank spots"" where she can't remember anything during parts of covid. She also is speaking slower (though that is improving) but has issues with memory and things like day/date.
So my Questions:
how long does this ""brain fog"" typically last? Is it permanent? Does anything help with this?
Any info on this greatly appreciated,
Rob

"So someone I was in contact with the whole last week of January tested positive on Monday Feb 1st.
Monday and Tuesday I felt more tired than usual, as after you exercise a lot but nothing more.
On Thursday and Wednesday I was also in contact with another person who also turned out to be positive by Thursday.
On Wednesday I got PCR tested and on Thursday was told I was negative.
Both Thursday and Friday I had throbbing headaches for several hours, the kind that makes it painful when you shake your head.
Since Friday night and until Sunday so far I've felt I've had a fever, although I don't have a temperature reading. I've also felt joint/muscle pain especially in lower back and legs.
Since Saturday I've also had pain when moving my eyes side to side, kind of like eye strain but I'm not sure it could be related to the fever.
My usual resting heartbeat should be around 60-70 bpm, but these last couple days I've seen it go up to the 90-100 bpm range and even once up to 110 bpm, only to later come back to 70-80 bpm.
I have not experienced other symptoms such as cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pressure, loss of smell or taste, etc.
Sometimes I feel a slight itch in my throat that disappears when drinking water.
I'm thinking I might get tested tomorrow again. Do you think the passed time between contacts with covid positive people is enough to actually show up if I have it? Or should I consider this might not be covid and pursue another kind of medical attention?
If in fact covid, does this is seem like a ""mild"" case so far? I'm male, 31 with no diagnosed health conditions.

I had pain in my back again and new symptoms of muscle pain in my arms, pain in my joints and a lot of tension in my upper body. I have tested negative for the virus twice now in weeks 5 and 6. I am over 9 weeks into the virus and am still suffering from muscle pain, breathlessness that feels like I can't get a deep breath in, gastric issues and stinging and teary eyes. All bloods and oxygen sats have been normal. Has anyone out there had similar for this length of time or longer? I am also confused about testing negative for the virus while presenting new symptoms. I've been told I'm not infectious any more so have been trying to take walks outside. I am trying to be as active as I can, some days are better some are worse. I am trying very hard to get better and am eating well even if I find it difficult. I feel there's a whole community out there of people like me that need guidance for prolonged symptoms but there is no advice from the health professionals and it is very unnerving.

"I had Covid, got my symptoms on 27 december, wasn't that bad in the first days until day 3-4 when i started having a strange insomnia, I was staying with my eyes closed all night without falling asleep, It is awful, I must say that! I had diarrhea for until 2 days ago and high accidity in my stomach at night. Now my stomach is better also I don't cough that much anymore but insomnia is still there. First I started taking melatonin pills so I could fall asleep after 2-3 hours of trying. Then I couldn't fall asleep anymore and I stayed awake like 3 nights, that was like day 7 to 10, were awful and I really tough that was it for me. Someone I fall asleep for some hours in day 10 and slept pretty hard for some more days. Then I started again not being able to sleep for another 2 days. A doctor told me to take imovane, I took it and I slept well in the first night, after an hour or so, was pretty good also the next days. Now I have probably like 14 days with imovane, everynight after taking it I slept, but last night I couldn't. I am very scared that I won't be able to sleep even this night. Do you guys had something like this? I am unable to fall asleep, whatever I do. I just don't feel that feeling anymore, to fall asleep. With imovane I don't even remember when I fall asleep which is very strange. I don't know what to do anymore, I get crazy, I never had such awful insomnia in my entire life.

"Hello all, my Mom is 78 years old and caught Covid in late November at a senior rehab facility. It took about 2-3 weeks for her to ""recover.""
Before Covid my mom could walk 35 feet in her walker and do all her exercises etc. She was due to come home and then caught Covid.
In December she seemed to loose almost all her strength. At the end of December she could stand for a few minutes and transition from bed to a chair. She came home around new years day.
She came home because of insurance reasons, otherwise I would still have her with skilled nursing.
It was obvious when she came home that Covid had wiped out her strength. Unfortunately about a week after coming home, she had a** stroke and UTI**. She was in the hospital for about a week and then she came home again. While visiting her in the hospital, I of course contacted Covid. I had a nasty time of it, where the monoclonal antibodies really helped. In the meantime, for the two weeks that I was really sick, I could only help my mom with a few things like food & meds. Since coming home from the stroke she has been bedridden.
So here's my question - she is currently bedridden and I am wondering what kind of recovery is possible? When do people typically get their strength back?
I've heard of people taking months to recover I think the combination of covid + stroke has done a number on her, however she is alive (count blessings) and she is mostly still there mentally though a little slow. I have tried doing exercises with her - bed exercises - and while she can do it, it totally wipes her out.
If you have been through anything like this, please let me know. Any comments appreciated.
Thanks,
Rob
PS - I have her on protein smoothies to get her strength back. She is currently taking these supps:
Multi vitamin
D3
Fish Oil
cranberry concentrate - for UTI
womens probiotic (she also has an antibiotic for UTI)
zinc

"Looking for advice about Dexamethasone please.
I started being ill Boxing Day - was tested 27th and positive result 28th.
Symptoms were pins needles hand feet, temp, slight cough, no energy, headache.
On NY Day took a turn for the worse and was rushed into A & E by ambulance as I had pain in stomach, back, high temp and was being sick, breathing was shallow.
Long story short, temp went over 41, needed oxygen and steroids. Luckily even though there was talk of ICU I didn't need and came out after 6 days - although I am still quite poorly.
Since then I have good and bad days like most, but yesterday my mood was terribly low, so much so I couldn't stop crying (which is unlike me), and felt really depressed. I look very pale and now have the rash and spots everywhere.
Ive read that Dexamethasone can cause bad mood swings, Mania , and numerous neurological problems - and think i am suffering from these.
I'm no longer on the steroids but wondered how long side effects last.

"My partner had COVID. She self isolated for 10 full days. On day 11 we eased the seperation. Being apart for 10 days meant it very quickly led to intimacy - we didn't kiss though and made sure we were not facing each other - she laid on her side facing away from me during penetration. Is this safe? We have passed the 10 day isolation but surely there cannot just be a simple line in the sand with this virus! If she has no symptoms other than a slight cough and lasting loss of smell and taste is she likely still infections after this amount of time or not?

Has little congestion or coughand little to no other symptoms. Unlike me, never lost taste or smell. Any thoughts?

Yesterday, i made the stupid and impulsive decision to attend a party with about 7 people, all who the host said had tested negative. none were exhibiting any symptoms so I feel like the chance i got it was very small, as I've unknowingly been around asymptomatic ppl before and didn't contract it. in addition to this, i was only there for about 10 minutes. still regret going as now I'm considering isolation just in case, as my friends would be really p****d off if i gave it to them. Should I isolate? Or am I being paranoid?

"Seen as most people with symptoms don’t self-isolate and super-spreaders are going to carry on regardless without a care. Is there an alternative way in which Covid-19 can be stopped..?
The biggest problem with isolating once you have the symptoms is that it’s too late; the virus has been passed on already in the several days previous when there were no symptoms. If only we knew from day 1 when people got infected rather than several days later.
Maybe the answer is separation and not isolation?
i.e. separate the people who won't keep their distance/wash their hands from those who will. The former group (the pro-covid group) are probably going to get it anyway. So let them get it in a controlled way and they can separate themselves from others before they catch it. This will stop super-spreaders.
What if shops, pubs, other small businesses and people were to identify themselves as ‘pro-covid’ or ‘anti-covid’. So people who have Covid or who don’t believe in taking precautions would be classed as ‘pro-covid’ and can shop, eat, drink at specific places (or times) as long as they wear an identifiable pro-covid marker like a lanyard so that ‘anti-covid’ people and vulnerable people who want to take precautions and wash their hands know who they are and can keep their distance. The problem is not everyone believes in exercising caution or distancing and you can’t force them to. These people will probably catch it anyway so let them catch it, but rather than allowing them to be a super-spreader and passing it on unknowingly to vulnerable people in public, let them 'shop and spread' in a controlled environment. Whether that be in designated areas or specific times of the day. So people who want to be safe will be safer and people who believe in freedom and want to take their chances can do so.
A good example would be to use students who can isolate in halls with like-minded people - because a certain percentage of them are going to mix anyway so identify the ones who are going to mingle anyway and let them socialise in their pro-covid bubble where they can catch it at the same time. This will give them and others they come into contact with in the future greater protection from greater immunity. A certain percentage may catch it again, but what percentage is this? Less than 5%? Surely that’s a good trade off. It will also allow others who are vulnerable or who fully intend to stick to the rules can fully separate themselves from the other spreaders. This is the only way to limit the spread! And it needn’t be for a long time, just a 2 week trial. At the very least it should be piloted in one area. Such as a university, where they are not interacting with others who do not have covid.
Even if just 1 young healthy person in a thousand were to become seriously ill from getting covid after such an experiment - they would have prevented the spread from infecting a further 3 to 4 thousand people! (because the ‘R’ value in people who don’t believe in social distancing is probably over 3 or 4 compared to 0.5 or less in the ones who do.

I don't know if he is part of her bubble or not . I've had a look for this information on the gov site and the nhs site and all they tell you is about test and trace informing you and then you would need to self isolate etc. The other site says ""if you think you have been in contact with someone who has the virus then self isolate"". what I'm struggling with is that she doesn't think she has, she knows she has. And I don't think the virus cares whether or not these two people are in the same bubble.

"Hi guys I'm just wanting some advice/info on a situation I have found myself in.
I've been working at a customers house that they have been renovating for the past couple of months. they moved out and went to live with one of their parents. I went there Tuesday night just to finish off some bits ( probably shouldn't of but they're about to have another baby and I wanted to complete before they moved back in) and one of them where in the home while I finished up. we passed a few times and had a chat probably no more than 5-10mins. I was there within the home for around 2hrs.
so the next day I receive a text off the customers saying that their dad who they have been living with for the last couple of months had been tested positive for covid that morning. The person who i had been in contact with is showing no symptoms but he has obviously been living with his dad long enough to surely pick up the virus.
I really don't know what to do. would I have been exposed for long enough to contract covid. or was he not contagious because he was showing no symptoms. Should I try and get a test some how?
if anyone has had this or has some information on anything close I would much appreciate it.
many thanks.

"Smell and taste disappeared completely for 2 weeks, after this time I began to feel something, but quite differently and weakly. For the fifth month now, the sense of smell and taste has not fully recovered (oranges, cucumbers, my adored watermelon have become disgustingly sickening in smell and taste for me.
The smells familiar to me have become completely different, having nothing to do with reality. I can't imagine my life without coffee, but coffee is now not at all the favorite drink that was before the illness. To be honest, it is very difficult for me to convey in words what I am experiencing, many do not understand how it is. Now a lot has changed for me, I start to forget the usual smells and tastes. When measured as a percentage, I can smell only 5 to 10% of smells and tastes. Sometimes I feel phantom smells, I used to wake up in the middle of the night from the smell of pomegranates, tangerines. I can say one thing, but the taste and smell have returned, but completely different and not very pleasant.

"I'm a 42 year old female. I live in New York (not NY City) and my area has been experiencing some spikes of covid, pretty much like everywhere else. I attended church this morning and am now extremely worried about being exposed to covid.
My church only has masses at 33% capacity and they are good about sanitizing the church after every mass. We maintain social distance (only every other pew is occupied with people well spread out and ushers will seat you) and wear masks, and all that. This morning I was seated 2 pews behind a family with 3 girls, looked like between ages of 8 and 14/15. They were all wearing masks but the middle girl (about 12 or 13?) was wearing it with her nose exposed the whole time. She was the only one not wearing it properly and neither of her parents seemed to care. She kept turning to her mother every minute or so and went to speak to her a couple of times, actually pulling the mask away from her mouth briefly as she did so. I couldn't believe it. I wanted to alert the ushers but they seemed oblivious and were too far away for me to get their attention.
Granted I have no idea if this girl is carrying covid. She didn't seem to look ill (she let out a tiny cough at one point but that was it) but the thing that worries me the most is asymptomatic spread and that you just don't know. She might even not know if she's carrying it (if she actually was). I was a fair distance away, not directly behind her (I'd say they were at least 10 feet in front of me and she was seated diagonally to my left). I was wearing an N95 mask that fit properly but I keep hearing how even they aren't enough to protect you.
I've got enough anxiety at the moment due to PMS (plus I'm a germophobe) so this is making it worse. Is there an extremely good chance I could have been exposed and infected? I'm very worried and thinking I can only rest easy until around the 17th or so if I haven't shown symptoms by then. I'm proactive, taking 1000mg of vitamin C a day as well as vitamin D, Zinc and Quercetin but I hope it's enough in case I was exposed. I'm even more worried because I heard about two guys around my age who recently died from it.

I actually dont have a problem with it necessarily, BUT do they have the right to ask for the medical results from someone who isnt employed by them? More to the point, what if my daughter doesnt want to disclose her results to a company she has nothing to do with.
Does anyone know the definitive answer to this? Are they legally allowed to request this?
Thank you all.

"I'm wondering whether I might have had a mild dose of Covid back in April. I had what felt like a cold starting, back of nose and throat felt a bit rough but no cough or runny nose, just felt generally not well. Later I went through a phase of what felt like motion sickness on and off for a few days. Since then I still have the nose/throat symptoms and my tongue feels like I have burnt it on a hot drink or something and I still don't feel 100%. Could these ongoing symptoms be from long Covid? I am wondering whether to have an antibody test.

I've had my flu shot, so I'm going for a test in a few days, since I can only do scheduled testing in my area.

"Hi there,
I tested positive for Covid 5 days ago. The day I got tested was the worse day of symptoms for me (stuffy nose, headaches, and body aches). The days following, I felt better but lost my smell and taste. I am on day 5 and I still feel okay, besides fatigue and occasional headaches. I'm curious if anyone with mild symptoms experienced worsening symptoms after a few days of feeling better. Is it possible that I could get another ""wave"" of more serious symptoms after feeling better? I haven't been able to find any information related to this question. Thanks in advance for the help!

"I am just getting over Covid19. My symptoms were very mild as is the case with over 80% of the people who do get infected.
I've read that the natural immunity you get after having the virus only lasts 3 months. As I understand it, any vaccine that exists is designed to spur this exact kind of natural antibody/immune response in the body to protect you. With that being said, why would the natural immune response from actually getting infected with the Covid virus only last 3 months, but that same biological reaction be permanent when you get a vaccine?

"I have to travel to the US to do a project for work in the third quarter of next year for a project I originally started in very late February in NYC but which was then cancelled due to Covid. I have received a letter from authorities telling me I will have to have an 'mRNA vaccine'.
I am a 65 year old male in generally good health and live in the UK.
I'm in the 5th Category (according to UK organisers) to get the vaccine. They only have the Pfizer one just now with 'emergency approval' and are currently vaccinating people with it. I fear by the time they get round to me - say, February / March - that I may well get the AstraZeneca/Oxford one. I know I will need a mRNA shot to fulfil the authorities' request. (I assume this is because of the questions raised by the AstraZeneca trials - which is certainly fair - most definitely for someone my age because only 12% of people my age were involved in their trial - only 4% over 70. I'm praying they just may make it - i.e., the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine - for under 55's. )
In any case I will need to get an mNRA vaccine - with which I'm fine with. My question - which I can't seem to get anyone to answer - at least so far - is this:
If I was to get the initial AstraZeneca (Vector) vaccine ... could I still have an mRNA one (say either Pfizer or Moderna)??? Would it be safe to do so? Or are you restricted to one kind of format once you've had it originally??? Any one know how long should be between the two shots? I'm thinking about three months - as that is the minimum length that theyseem to think those who have endured Covid have substantial antibodies following - or so I've read.
Any advice you can offer me in terms of this will be HUGELY appreciated. I have been pondering this for days.

"Hello,
i thought id outline my experience with the virus to both vent my own frustrations and to get to know if others have been the same.
I tested positive for CoronaVirus back at the start of October, prior to this i wasn't the healthiest person with a weight of 18.5 stone and no physical work outs, most sat between a computer and bed. I started with a fever which lasted 2 days and a small cough, i took and test and found out i had covid. The fever didnt get worse, but i did start to feel faint, and often began to have a few panic attacks when i felt i couldnt catch my breath, but i kept myself isolated away from my family. I then lost my sense of taste and smell after 3 days. All in all during having covid i was okay, other than the odd need to lie down and take some deep breaths on occasion i was doing my normal routine. 14 days later all of my symptoms where gone and i ordered a new test, this came back negative.
O how i wish to be back in those days as from here it only gets worse.
For the next few weeks i suffered with tiredness, shortness of breath awful chest pain, and an uncomfortable throat, not sore just not right. i used paracetamol daily, and was advice by my GP to use anti inflammatory over the counter medicine for my throat if i felt it was swollen. I used Ice packs and hot water bottles on my chest which really seemed to calm me down and easy the pain. By this point we are on week 4 and my shortness of breath just seems to be getting worse, i speak to my GP as ive been having stomach problems, constipation for a few days at a time with barely any bowl movement. I was prescribed a brown inhaler and advised on some over the counter laxatives to try to help. The brown inhaler does the trick for a little while and i feel i can take deep breaths again, the laxitive seems to give me some relief, but only a bowl movement every 2 days and its often diharea. I keep on like this for a week or so before i start to feel short on breath again, my aunty allows me to use her unopened spare blue inhaler and my GP lets me go for blood tests, they also then prescribe me a blue inhaler. The blood tests show high levels of dead red blood cells in my liver function, that they arnt too concerned about, and i am sent on my way for blood tests in 2 weeks time. About a week later my chest started to sound like their was fluid in there and i had an abnormal heart beat occuring so i went to A+E, they did blood work, a scan of the chest, blood preasure and oxygen levels and told me they can seem to find anything at risk and that im 'fit and healthy to go'.
That was week 8 and all of last week i felt so bad, chest aches, pains in my arm pits when i lay or move certain ways, breathless, and a weight on my chest. I phoned my GP on thursday to discuss getting a new brown inhaler as mine seemed yo not work as it used to, after discussing how i was feeling she gave me a 5 day course of steroid tablets and a x-ray to be done at my local hostpital between 9:30 nd 4:30 any week day. I take my first round of tablets and my chest feels so relieved, but the strange slow covered heart beat is still there and keeps me on edge, i have my x-ray and come home to a call from my GP about my second blood tests and the ones from A+E, they say my liver function tests are still a bit abnormal and that i have a high count of redblood cells, to which they can wait 3 momths and see of its covid after effects or organise an untralsound, i opt for the later and await the hospital to mail. I explain my heart/lung feeling to the GP and he prescribes me a 5 day course of antibiotics to take with my 5 day steroid tablets.
Day 1 felt good, things seemed okay, day 2 was a bit achey but once again okay and towards the night i felt like a new man. Day 3 was worse, tight chest most of the day, aches and pains, shortness of breath, and my neck just started to feel so stiff and clogged. Im on day 4 today and once again my chest is so heavy, my breathing feels shallow but i can take deep breaths on occassion, and i have 1 day left to pray i feel better before the course is complete. I still but far less frequently feel the odd heart beat and lung feeling, but my chest feels like a pair of hands is pushing on the top of my pecks no matter how i try to sit or lay.
All in all thats my story so far, week 9 begins today, im constantly scared to sleep and not wake up, or to wake up and be in more pain or have more issues. I just want to have 1 day of normal. I cant even do the things i used to enjoy like sit at a computer and talk with friends or play games, because i just feel so closed in and tight and on edge, last night i had a mild panic attack from just sitting there for 2 hours feeling breathless.
is there anyone that can relate or feels the same?
My medical background is no allergies, i had asthma as a child when i was 7 or 8 but im now 28, 29 in december, and i am above typical bmi.

"You probably get questions all the time , however I'm in a delima. My Mom wears mask ""everywhere except when she is at work"". Why this is? idk? Her coworkers have already had it but she hasn't gotten it thus far. Anyways, I'm married with a 6 month old son. We also have baby sisters that are family on my wife's side that have multiple morbidities (high blood pressure, diabetes, etc). Since I value your medical opinion, my question is this. Since my mom doesn't wear a mask at work, is it unsafe to be around her even if we all wear masks (including her) and wash our hands? She wants to come over and see our son, but this is causing a rift in our marriage because I want them to come see my son. My wife is a RN BSN and she's adamant that essentially we shouldn't ever allow my mother over if she's not going to wear a mask. I know it's not your place to be Dr. Phil. Just want to know if mask wearing and washing hands is safe enough or if we should just draw a line in the sand and say no if she refuses to wear one at work.

I have however lost 100% taste and smell and that gives me anxiety when I think of it never returning.

"Hi all,
I've had initial headache 10 days ago. Last Saturday has low grade fever until Tuesday. Never had cough and since Tuesday no fever. Yesterday did some tests and :
white cells and lymphocytes normal
elevated crp, 21
elevated d dimer, 1550
elevated fibrinogen, 730
X Ray of chest showed no problems with alveola, just some ""emphasis"" in tracea and bronchi.
My doctor panicked and prescribed:
two IV antibiotics
Heparin
dexamethasone IV
Talked to another doctor and he said it's bull. Maybe heparin, but it's not really neccesary.
A third one said xarelto is enough and 4mg dexamethasone.
My self assessment is that on Thursday and Friday, I was feeling weak in the afternoon, which means the body was fighting hard. On Saturday it's to be expected than inflammation markers are high, but the body is fighting well and no need to do anything.
Any suggestions?

"Hello,
i don't know where to post this as google doesn't find any coronavirus forums, because news etc. take priority. I tried face mask, that blue type, which medical personal wears. There is huge space between nose and my face like 3cm+. I also found one, which has nano fiber - developed my local university. And it was almost too small and again: there is gigantic space between nose and face. It makes sense, because strings behind your ear on which holds face mask on your face, pull it outwards from your face, because nose.
I had respirator, which had this solved, but it teared: while i gently stretched it... It was some russian crap, i didn't buy it tbh... But what concerns respirators... you can't breath in that, that's the problem. So i really need some good face mask. Problem is on many of these sites, they don't even list size. And even if they had like l, or xl. Common it is laughable, all people have different faces. Chances that they will fit are miniscule. Also majority is overpriced for one use, it would ruin me: trying to find a fit and than buy it frequently afterwards. And i am not even poor, or anything... IF there is even face mask, which doesn't have space between your nose. But coronavirus, is like microscopic particle, or smaller. 3cm is joke, i am not expert, but isn't it completely useless?
It is really strange, that is 2020 and people can't even make face mask, which would be wearable... I am questioning my reality now...

Currently on day 8 feeling the same.
I can smell strong or concentrated scents from up close like soap, disinfectants or spices but I can't really smell mild substances or even food. I can differentiate basic tastes like sweet or sour but no distict flavour. I get headaches too.
I've lost my appetite.
I get stomach cramps especially in my upper abdomen but it's not painful, just uncomfortable.
It stresses me out a lot tbh.

"My father (78M) was infected with covid around 2 weeks ago. At first, we thought his fever and weakness were just common cold and it would heal. But when he started getting dizzy , we took him to the hospital. Doc said said he had low oxygen and high sugar levels. He got tested positive for covid and was kept in the hospital for a week where he got better, then we had to take him home because he made a huge fuss since he hates hospitals and feels very uncomfortable staying there. Doc said his oxygen level drops without an oxygen mask, so after much effort , we got him an oxygen concentrator. 1 week later, he has no fever and probably no other symptoms except for shortness of breath and low oxygen level. At first, he could stay 1 hour+ until his oxygen level drops to 80s, but now he's always on the concentrator. He doesn't say it, but i can tell he doesn't sleep much at night and sometimes his voice is hoarse during the day, his respiratory rate is around 24-27 bpm, and i don't know how long it will take for him to heal (if it will). He's taking enoxaparin 40mg and we're always checking his pulse ( usually jumps between high 80s and 90-95 with concentrator) and his sugar levels. Is there any estimates to how long this shortness of breath and dropping oxygen level can last for? few weeks? specially since we could only rent an oxygen concentrator and don't think we can keep it for long. Is there anything else i can do??
Thank you in advance.

"Hello, My dad have been in the hospital for more than 17 days now due to covid infection, they've given him HCQ +AZYthromycin in the beginning, he's now under heavy antibiotics, his latest 2 blood work were pretty bad according to the doctors, his CRP levels were around 300.
They're using 1-3 hours of Non invasive ventilation and other times he's on a rebreather type, He can get to 95 SPO2 with the rebreather one. He can speak and is well conscious at the moment, but the doctors are telling me he's not getting better only his clinical state is stable for now, but his body not responding to anything, seems like inflammation is through the proof and not going down, and they gave him all they had now we just need to wait for his body and immune system to respond.
Will convalescent plasma help him ? or something like interleukin ? I've discussed it with doctors but they don't seem to be interested in these at the moment.

"I'm a 24 years old, with no health condition, and normally active.
Last year I got a pneumonia that lasted for quite a while, and after that I have been getting, bronchitis, chest infections in repetition all along the year.
Back in March this year I caught the Covid 19 and it lasted for about 3 weeks with symptoms like feeling short of breath, cough, fever, and all the other stuff. Since then I have had weeks where I'm absolutely fine, and others where my chest feels cold, tight and uncomfortable, I'm extremely tired, dizzy, short of breath, coughing and with muscle pain. It is very annoying as it just comes out of nowhere and keeps me unable to do everyday things. So far after mentioning it to my GP I've had a blood test done that came out normal.
Is anyone in the same situation since having Covid? Could it just be something not related to it?

"Hi
So I check on the internet and I see sore throat being one of covid-19 symptoms. I have mild sore throat that developed a week ago. It doesn't feel like a usual sore throat and it doesn't get worse when I swallow or anything. I went for a walk around 13 days ago and had a takeaway food a week ago.
I have no other symptoms but the fact that I sometimes cough on purpose to try to relieve the itchy, scratchy throat. and my cough seems wet. Nothing seems to be relieving the soreness either which isn't that bad but it is bothering.
Should I be worried?
Edit: I have been having more acid reflux in the past 2 weeks as well. I did want to blame it on that but I took omeprazole and the reflux went away and sore throat remained.

I have touched the door knobs of the store ... there was no one else in the store at that time ...
Question - do you have to touch virus on surface and directly touch your mouth , nose or ears ..
if you touched other surfaces like my car steering ..etc .. does the viral load get reduced .. assuming there is virus in the first place ..
Apart from that I have not done any other risky behavior ... am I just overthinking and being paranoid ?

"I tested positive for COVID-19 August 22nd after losing my taste and smell. I also had a clogged ear and dizziness. Two weeks went by and my taste and smell returned. I am now 4 weeks past being diagnosed and last week I started to have tingling pins and needles sensation in both of my feet. This week I've had horrible lower leg muscle weakness. The pins and needles sensation started to spread to my hands and now I have the weakness in my arms! It comes in waves where I start to feel better and I think it is going away but then it hits me hard with extreme weakness in my arms and legs with the tingling and sometimes burning pains. I read online patients some patients can acquire Guillian-Barre syndrome after being exposed to Viruses such as COVID and my symptoms sound like the disease! I'm scared that this could get progressively worse and I end up in the hospital, I'm not sure though because the severity comes and goes every few hrs . My doctor did lab work which all came back normal. I messaged her again about what I should do next if it continues to worsen and I'm waiting to hear back. Has anyone else experienced this after being exposed??

"Hi All!
so i've been experiencing unusual symptoms which i think may be due COVID-19 and wanted to know if anyone else has similar symptoms. It began last week with a severe panic attack that caused me to hyperventilate. My breathing was heavy and i experienced tingling in my hands and feet. The next few days i had similar symptoms, i saw 4 different doctors and they diagnosed it as a panic attack since my COVID results came back negative. i occasionally feel a warm sensation in my chest and legs/feet. I also experience chills and hot flashes. I do not have a cough or fever. Throughout each day i occasionally feel a throb or pressure in my head, the pain subsidises when i lay on my side. i also sometimes experience confusion and brain fog and i've recently developed, what it seems to be Foreign language syndrome. im currently on day 8 and the symptoms have gotten a lot more manageable, however, i do have an occasional dry cough. Is anyone else experiencing this?

"I am not totally convinced that this app will be so beneficial to all.
My concern is the roll, in which the smartphone Bluetooth is applied.
I understand that if you become within 2mts of a registered positive
tested person , who has put there information into the NHS app it will
then pair up with another phone which in turn will tell that person that they
have been in contact with a positive tested person. Problem I see is that
people may have to self isolate, on the phones information. There may
be no proof that these two phone owners have actually had physical or
biological contact. There might be an eight foot high garden fence between
them. The average range on a Bluetooth device is 10mts so what's to prevent
that the Bluetooth pairing is done at 6mts

"Hi,
I've been having a discomfort in my nose since the last few days. It feels sort of congested on the inside even though it isn't actually congested. I had a runny nose few days back but now it's okay with just this weird congested/pressure like feeling in my nose.
I am also not able to smell or taste anything except basic sweet and salty flavours but nothing distinct.
I did come in contact with a COVID-19 patient and it started a few days after that.
Slight fatigue and headaches.
No fever, cough or any other symptoms.
I got the test done and it came out negative but I may have got the test done too early or too late maybe.
What can I do now?
Also, how long does it take for the smell and taste to return?

"hello everyone, i wrote on here about 5/6 months ago when i first got ill. ive had pretty similar stuff to most of you (i am breathless all the time, cant exert myself much because i get tired and really breathless at night). if im honest i am pretty much the same as i was 6 months ago with no improvement. i had a private antibody test, but it came back negative. after pushing my gp i had an xray which was all clear. other than that i havent really had much help from the doctor - they just say i have asthma triggered by a virus. im not sure about anyone else, but the inhalers dont seem to help at all and im not sure what else to do, is there any other treatment i can have? they prescribed me some steriods, but im not sure weather to take them as i know they can weaken your immune system. ive heard there are covid clinics, should i see if i can get refered? ive figured out i cant exert myself (i seem to get a delayed reaction for a couple of days after). any tips would be great. thanks

"Before I explain whats wrong I have a doctors apt scheduled for tomorrow and I am getting tested, I am just posting here because I am kind of impatient and want to hear opinions right now.
I am 22 (F), right now I am living at home with my mom and dad, and brother. My mom and I have been very good about not leaving the house unless needed, I have only been to work and occasionally out to a store for school supplies and I have had no issues.
My brother on the other hand, has been out partying and drinking and around so many people this summer, long story short, he got covid around 3 weeks ago. Fast forward a bit and he is released from isolation, but now my mom tested positive for covid, and the only explanation is from my brother, since she wasnt around anyone else.
Fast forward to now, and I am not feeling great. I do not have a fever but I started to get a small cough, I slept all day yesterday, and I have chills every once in a while.
Does this sound like I could possibly have covid? My brother was asymptomatic minus he couldnt taste or smell, and my mom is doing much better but she felt like she had a bad sinus infection/cold. I really dont want to have covid, but I havent been anywhere in the past 2 weeks (work told me to stay home and quarantine) so I dont know, covid doesnt seem out of the question...

"A few years ago, my son had Guillain Barré Syndrome following a bout of 'flu. Guillain Barré is an auto-immune syndrome where anti-bodies are generated to combat, say, a 'flu, and end up attacking the body's own peripheral nervous system. Fortunately he was diagnosed and treated very quickly, and has completely recovered. I read that if someone has had Guillain Barré, they have about a 1% chance of getting it again in their lifetime.
My worry now is concerning Covid-19, particularly now that people seem to be ignoring the social distancing rules. Is is possible or likely that a Covid-19 infection could re-trigger his Guillain-Barré? He is in his 20's, and has just finished university, so he should be looking to start his career. But should he be shielding instead?

"Hi,
So went out in Aberdeen on Saturday night just past for a few drinks. Both pubs I was in was sat a t a separate table from anyone else. I then joined a couple of friends when they came in. I checked with staff if this was OK as didn't want to just join in case that wasn't aloud. But she was happy about it. The table I was sat at my friend's was smaller but we were all sitting back in our chairs so it didn't mean we were all hunched over the table. We then moved on to a another pub but there was a bit of a wait to get in. Hardly any social distancing in place nobody listening to security at all. I then decided to leave as I wasn't comfortable in that situation. In hindsight I shouldn't of gone out. But now I'm scared I've put my whole family at risk. Or it's all in my head. I don't have any symptoms just now and I do use a vaporiser so I do tend to cough now and again. Has anyone else had thoughts like this.

I am worried if I was exposed to Covid or these symptoms are because of covid
Though I followed all good habits I suddenly had difficultly breathing. Today I was not able to breath through nose as those turbunates were kind of blocked.
I suspect it triggered my anxiety and I had episode of shortness of breath. I used Arbuterol ashtama spray and felt better. I also regularly use antihistamines and steroid nasal spray. Not sure if its contributing to dry nose...

During good spells I feel almost back to normal. Yesterday afteenoon I was feeling I could go back to work next week (thats when my sick line is due up) and then last night I was near phoning NHS24 due to my breathing and tightness in my chest being so bad again. It feels like a never ending cycle and am getting concerned I will be left with some long term issues. I don't seem to be getting much support/follow up from doctors unless I contact them about something feel a bit like I'm just left to it because I haven't been hospitalised. My appetite has been fine through out however eating is a hard task, I get very breathless during it and after. I know everyone is learning as we go with this but sometimes I get quite down with just being told it will take time just rest and just being left to it. Im so glad I've found people in similar situations x

"Hi All,
I don't know what I expect from posting on here, I guess I just want to know that I'm not alone and it would be good to share our stories with each other.
My husband (39) was struck down with it at the end of March. I (37) got it exactly a week later, early April. A couple of weeks later both my boys (2 & 4) suffered with mild symptoms. April was a hard month.
We fought off the virus at home, we were never tested as they weren't testing unless you were seriously in need of hospital care. So there is the worry that we didn't have Covid, however we had almost all the symptoms at some point in April and we are living with the havoc is causes to your body and mind still today.
I have achey days where I can barely move. I still suffer with chest pains. Sharp in the front and the feeling that somebody is sat on my back. Early June I attempted some light exercise and was left with a crackly breath and horrendous chest pains. I went to A&E and luckily it wasn't lung clots, however its muscle damage/scarring in my lungs. I was informed like its no big deal and I should just rest for 3-6 months. This is a big deal to an active person like myself who relies heavily on exercise to help my mental health too!
I suffer with headaches that put me in bed for a few hours due to the dizziness/nausea they cause.
I also don't have a great digestive system anymore.
My Husband has the dizziness/nausea/headache symptoms come back every fortnight that put him in bed for a day or two. This has also caused issues with his digestive system.
My little 2 year old has had a recurring cough for weeks and weeks. I worry. I try not to but this is so concerning. The doctors aren't concerned because he is well in himself and there are no signs of an infection. This is sad that its now deemed ok for him to suffer with a bad cough for so long.
What I'm starting to get annoyed over is the media's focus being solely on the survival rate. We are survivors yet our health is severely affected. People are going about their lives thinking this won't affect them because they're young and healthy and it will. There are even articles written on asymptomatic people who show lung issues.
I am so angry this has happened to us and scared about what this means for my children's health in the future. As somebody who already was affected by anxiety on a daily basis I am concerned over my growing obsession with this and what it is also doing to my mental health.
We are taking Vitamin D and eating healthy, as we were before Covid. We are no longer exercising as much. I don't know what else I can do to help my family going forward.
Thank you for listening.

"I began feeling ill about 10 days ago--fatigue, nausea, severe headache--noticed my BP was quite elevated at up to 180/100 at its worst. Less at times but still high with 150s/mid 90s. Finally on day 8 from onset, BP was decreasing--was 121/71 and no headache this morning--145/94 tonight and mild headache. Keeping in touch with my MD--had covid test on Day 4 (they barely swiped just inside nostrils) and test was negative. Went for drive thru test today where i did much more/deeper swab--waiting for results. Anybody has elevated BP as symptom---and what type nasal swab test is more reliable?

"hi everyone.
looking for a bit of reassurance. since end of march beginning of april I have had a sore throat and one tonsil slightly bigger than the other.
I never had the test but the doctors are pretty sure i had it back then where I suffered breathlessness / tiredness and a slight sore throat.
however since then every week I have a sore throat but doesn't hurt to swallow.
my tongue also feels a little bigger than it should and my neck feels like I have pressure on it.
I've had blood and swabs done all come back fine.

I am still getting tight feelings in my chest and still have a widespread rash (which the GP has finally referred me to dermatology for) I also get a dodgy belly more than usual, like I did with covid. I got rested 6 weeks after Covid and last week had my antibody test at work which showed I have the antibodies. I'm just concerned why I still have a few symptoms after 3 months? Does anybody else?

"Hello everyone,
Even tho I wear a mask 24/7 and try to keep a distance from crowds as much as possible, these 2-3 days I started getting some extreme fatigue cases where at some moments of the day I feel so fatigued that I couldn't even move to the kitchen for example. Before the Corona out-brake I used to walk for a lot of kilometres a day, now after months in isolation I feel like I cant go to the supermarket and not get tired.
(I would like to point out that Im a smoker)
I don't have a high Temperature,nor Coughing nor Sore Throat but I have this feeling of being able to breath a lot Easier (?) than I could before, and that seems strange to me because this has never occured to me before.
I also have sudden wakes up early in early hours such as 5AM and such (Just the time that im writing this forum discussion) .
Could I be an A-Symptomatical case? Or its just Spring fever that occurs regularly..

"The first time I read some of the threads in this forum I felt like crying. I identifies so much with so many of your testimonies, that I took that to mean that I too was experiencing a freak prolonged covid episode. Like most of you, I was very sick. Throughout I was terrified, not only of my own sickness, but of my friends and family, and the that of the crumbling world around me. I researched and read every article out there on symptoms, pandemic management, contagion etc. I also read up way too many healthcare pages and self diagnosed all sorts of whacky symptoms and side effects. I tried asthma and allergy medication, I tried steroids, abx, the works... I had cat scans, x rays and blood tests, Mr saw at least 3 doctors. Nothing was wrong with me. No with my body at least...
I had a flu, maybe even covid, but that didn't last longer than a couple of weeks. my cough and tiredness must have lingered a bit, but the disease was gone. What happened to me, and I'm sure to most of you out there, is that at some point in our worries we transitioned from a physical illness to an anxiety disorder, and this requires a diametrically opposed treatment to what we're doing. I could not believe anxiety could cause such physical symptoms, but believe me when I say it can. Myalgia, burning sensation, chest tightness, GI symptoms... I suffered from all of these things excruciatingly.
Please, if you're out there and feel like you've had covid symptoms for more than a month, it's time to put down you computer, phone and tablet, rest, relax, meditate, see a mental health professional, and finally embark on the road to recovery. I'm on my way there after over 2 months.
Godspeed and good luck!

"Hi. I have a blended family, and my step-daughters live with us half of the week and with their mom, grandmother, step-grandfather, aunt, and two cousins the other half of the week. During the pandemic, I wanted to only allow myself and my husband into the kitchen to prepare food and drinks to mimimize the spread of germs related to COVID-19 or any other bacteria, virus, or other pathogen. We have two separate bathrooms, separate bedrooms, etc., but only one kitchen. Do you think this would help minimize the spread of germs? My thinking is that my husband and I wash our hands really well, we have been quarantining in our home, etc. We do not know if the individuals at my spouse's ex's house are quarantining or practicing safety measures. We know that they have taken at least one trip out of town, and my step-daughters tell me that their mother has told them not to wash their hands because it makes their skin dry. In the kitchen, we have a fridge, several counters, many drawers, a hutch with snacks, a pantry and storage area with snacks, two sinks, etc. There are over 200 touch surfaces, so I just thought that by only allowing the two adults get food for everyone, we would potentially be minimizing the spread of germs from one house to another.

"Hello all,
Apologies for starting a separate thread on this. I am really suffering from very annoying insomnia due to Covid (suspected) and was wondering if anyone is keen to share their experience? It seems a lot of us are having problems sleeping.
Week 2-3: Terrible. Some nights of complete no sleep.
Week 4-12: Fragmented 5-7 hours. Waking up every hour or two. There were only a handful of nights that I could get 3-4 hours in a row. Sometimes I wake up and find myself over-breathing.
Week 13-14: Gone backwards again. 3-4 hours on average per night.
The problem is staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. I'm using melotanin, also valeriaan and CBD. None seems to really keep me asleep.
How has your experience been? Anything that helped?
The theory is that this is to do with your vagus nerve. In the process of fighting off the virus it is a bit messed up and may take a long time to heal and reset itself.
Many thanks

"Hi everyone,
I'm now into my 11th week of illness. I've never had a test for covid but am still struggling with breathlessness. I spoke to my doctor again today and this is what he told me, I'm sure many of you will find this reassuring.
I was beginning to worry that it wasn't covid and if not what the hell was it, but he said he speaks to patients every day with the same symptoms as many of us on here who have been also suffering for many weeks and some of these have had positive tests for covid and is very certain that's what I've had.
He also said the reason I'm struggling is to do with the alveoli in the lungs. He said they are not getting the oxygen to the body properly which is why your chest sounds clear but you can't breathe. He was very insistent about this.
This article helps explain it:
https://health.clevelandclinic.org/heres-the-damage-coronavirus-covid-19-can-do-to-your-lungs/
He also said the antibody tests are not great and to just take it that it is covid I've had. He said to carry on with what I've been doing ; walking gently when I can. He also said other patients symptoms are also up and down just like mine and proof of my o2 stats fluctuating is proof it's my alveoli not working properly (I have a fitness tracker which also measures o2).
I hope this helps to put your mind at rest like it did with me and make you realise we are not going mad or dying of something else! He said it is going to take time to improve.

"ninth of May I had a slight fever around my shoulder blades radiating up to my neck for a couple of days I didn’t think any more of it and went to out walking Around the cliffs in the moors near where I live.
literally a week later I was in bed with severe fever tastebuds completely gone because I live on the Isle of Wight I sent off for a test which came back negative. I found my GP querying my fever to be told by GP that 30% all the tests from his patients had come back negative and had to be run redone again. I sent off another test which came back void. following week I felt really well full of energy went walking along the cliffs tastebuds came back sadly four days later the fever started up again on different parts of my body really bad burning sensation on my feet around my shoulder blades cross my stomach and has caused upset.
I was really surprised that the fever had come back so I sent off another test which came back negative again I phoned my GP to say that I had concerns if this wasn’t COVID-19 there must be something wrong with me my kind GP for me they were for such things as fevers before COVID-19 and to continue taking paracetamol every day I’m 65 and it’s my birthday next Wednesday I do have heart disease and I am slightly overweight and suffer from asthma apart from the fever I’ve had muscle pain on my legs mainly around the shins and headaches. very difficult to gauge COVID-19 as the doctors don’t know much about it nor do I it is strange how some days I feel quite well and then the fever just kicks in and I have to go to bed I’m surprised I hear that some people are given antibiotics my GP has categorically said this is a virus antibiotics will not work thankfully the paracetamol are keeping things at bay I haven’t got a thermometer so I I don’t know what my temperature is quite often I have to have a water bottle and now I feel I meant on fire inside my body I’m quite cool on the outside.

"Hi, I was tested positive for Covid-19 8 weeks ago now. I had my illness pretty mildly. I never had a temp but felt feverish and i had a slight cough and upper back pain on and off for a few days, wanted to sleep a lot and general weakness. When my symptoms starting so did a strange Rash all over my stomach and a strange silent rumble which I couldn't tell if it was coming from the top of my stomach or my chest? I had diarrhoea in the 2nd week and the rumble disappeared for a week but has since come back. The rash has spread under my arms, groin area and lower back. Doctor said this probably was not Covid related but since it's been there since my symtoms started I beg to differ!! it's been there 8 weeks now!! has anyone else had similar symtoms for this long?

"Myself and my brother do our parents shopping and deliver it. I vac and clean their bungalow every 2 weeks. They are spritely 91 year olds, a little slow on their legs but otherwise healthy and not on any medication. I am retired, as is my wife. My brother works in the waste disposal industry and his wife cleans at a (currently COVID free) smaller nursing home. Both my brother and his wife have regular tests for the virus, all having showed up as negative so far. They get the results 3 days after attending the test.
The other weekend myself and my wife called around to see my parents unannounced and witnessed my brother and his wife inside, albeit at least 2 metres away, drinking tea/coffee prepared with my parents' crockery. No PPE worn either. My brother has the opposite attitude to risk avoidance to me and sees my stance as a overreaction. He seems to have convinced our parents also of this. They (correctly) see his wife as undertaking a heroic and crucial task in maintaining the cleanliness of the home in which she works, but then say they do no not want to banish her.
When I call around to do their cleaning, they always retire temporarily to their garden summer house and read / do crosswords etc.
When I call with my wife, we either stay in their garden or talk at the door. My mum especially fusses and says ""come in and have a cup of tea"" - which we politely decline. My parents have now been isolated in their suburban home for 10 weeks and have not ventured out.
Am I right in my reaction? Am I justified in saying my brother and his wife should stay outside the home when they call?

"Hello Everyone,
I've sent the post shown below to several people as replies to their posts. I hope I'm not over posting which I know can be irritating but I've had such success with the treatment method described below that I'm on a real campaign to encourage Corona patients to try it. Feedback would be great. Anything from ""nope, didn't work for me to yes I'm healed"" would be appreciated.Pray we can beat this thing.
I had flu symptoms coming on strong on March 25, 2020. Not sure if it was Corona or just regular flu. Anyway I immediately used a method I call my ""kill flu"" treatment which I've been using with 100% success for the past 20 years. Just suggesting that you try it because it's been so successful for me. Hoping it could be successful for you. Very simple: A. Drink 3 glasses of very warm water (not hot enough to burn you but definitely very warm). B. Use a hair blower on medium temperature to blow warm air onto your face for 30 minutes. C. Use deep breathing for the 30 minutes to repeatedly fill your lungs with warm air. Also breathe in through your nose for awhile then through your mouth etc. trade back and forth. D. Do this 2 to three times a day for a couple of days.Hope this works for you.
It literally changed my life 20 years ago. I'm a retired teacher and when I first started teaching I would get quite sick multiple times with the flu each year from October to March. Called in sick constantly during that time period each year. Finally out of desperation and much research I came up with the method described above. I had reached the point where I was considering quitting teaching. First time I used this method I was back to normal in one day. From that point on I never called in sick again due to the flu. I've been reading so many stories of people suffering through Corona; it just tears at me. I’m making this suggestion to as many as possible. It definitely worked for me on the flu (and possibly on Corona in March). I really hope this method works for Corona patients. Sincerely, Rowland Reeves

"Almost 8 weeks I’ve been ill. It started with a bit of a tight chest, no cough, no temperature. A couple of days later and my chest started to feel raw and sore just assumed i had a virus ....probably covid. My chest started to burn constantly all day long the burning lasted 3.5 weeks. Then sharp pains felt like it was flipping from one side of my chest to the other, also felt like the burning went down to my tummy area. Shortness of breath begun day 7. Sometimes it was so bad I had to really concentrate on my breathing to catch my breath. Also my heart rate has been through the roof as soon as I move, walk a little it goes really high like I’m fast walking/jogging etc 145bpm feel dizzy. Week 2 started with the hot night sweats! Waking up like I’m on fire. Sweating awful Body odour-I don’t suffer with this normally. Still having the hot sweats week 7... every night. Also had facial flushing and have had a temp on and off for 6 weeks. headaches and body aches I was given antibiotics after 3 weeks Incase. I went to the hospital as the doctors said it couldn’t be covid as it was going on too long. I had a chest X-ray that was clear. Sent home. I wondered if the virus has caused some sort of gastric issues and that the burning is due to severe acid reflux. Something I’ve NEVER suffered from only when pregnant. I’m now on Omeprazole 40g for 2 weeks. The burning and pain in my back has eased. I’m now left with the some chest pains but the high heart rate upon walking around my house has not gone away nor has the acute breathlessness. Has anyone had high heart rate, severe gastric issues eg oesophagitus and shortness of breath , hot sweats with this illness? Can’t take much more of this. im 39 on no meds no heath condtions usually active mum of 4!

"Hi there
i was just wondering if anyone else has found that they experience symtoms when they drink alcohol?
I believe I had Covid at the end of March, (symptoms were tight chest, breathing laboured, temperature and chills, fatigue, and a sore throat, which lasted initially for ten days, and then a week after feeling I was.recovered, I had a resurgence of my symptoms.
Since then, I've noticed that I've started getting symtoms of a very runny nose and eyes streaming when I drink alcohol. i don't think it can be hay fever as I don't have those symptoms any other time. At first I thought it was an intolerance I might have to cider, but having drank a glass of wine list night, and had the same problem.. I'm now thinking it might be all alcohol. This definitely wasn't happening before Covid.
I am having feelings of nausea most days, which I wonder if means the virus might still be lingering after reading others posts, although I did have a test a couple of weeks ago, and that was negative.
i would be interested to hear people's thoughts, and if they've noticed something similar?
Thanks

"Hi all, been feeling unwell since yesterday morning. I just wanted to check if these sounded like coronavirus symptoms?
Yesterday morning both me and my partner woke up feeling very hot - we believe this is because we had a winter duvet on the bed and have no air flow or windows in the bedroom, and with the warmer weather, we think we must have overheated a little. When I got up to go to the toilet, I felt really hot and a little light-headed, achy. I didn't want to touch my usual morning tea as I felt queasy as well. I attempted to eat lunch, but only felt more nauseous after a couple bites. My boyfriend, although he felt hot and a little nauseous upon waking up, felt fine after an hour or two, and still is.
Early in the afternoon, I threw up. I felt better and relieved of my nausea for a little while until I started to feel achy, nauseous and feverish again. I was sick again shortly after. I had a couple of naps in the afternoon which made me feel better. By the end of the day I felt significantly better, only a little achy and a little hot. I never measured my temperature as I don't currently have a thermometer, but it felt that any potential fever was dwindling as I was no longer fidgeting or feeling any slight chills.
I slept well, only woke up with a slight headache and much lesser body aches, which have mostly gone as of now. I no longer feel feverish or hot to touch, and have been able to eat and drink (just unable to do my usual quantities). I look a lot better today too. I would just like to say that I am not pregnant (haven't had sex since my last period), and I have had zero contact with the outside world since lockdown has begun. I am isolating with my boyfriend and his family at their home in a rural area. I only go out for walks. His parents have been doing the shopping as we are working from home full-time. They have been very careful in doing so and follow all the precautions. I was going to consider being tested today if I still felt feverish, but I don't. Nobody believes I have it, but I am a hypochondriac so it still worries me. I have no other symptoms and feel far better today. Should I be concerned that this is covid?

"I live in New York on Long Island, which is still considered a hot spot. Our state's lockdown is supposed to start easing on Friday, but will probably take at least a few weeks longer for my region.
I've got to make 3 visits to health care facilities next week and I'm very worried. Tuesday morning I have an appointment for a yearly mammogram/ultrasound. Another day (either Wed or Thurs, I haven't decided yet) I'm supposed to go to a lab to have blood work done for my yearly physical, which is on the 27th. And then Friday I have another yearly physical at my pulmonologist's office (was diagnosed with mild asthma when I was 12, though starting to wonder if I outgrew it as I no longer take daily medication for it and my symptoms have pretty much disappeared).
The thing that concerns me the most is exposure to a significant viral load. I'd read some good info not long ago that it's the viral load that does you in with this virus.. that going to the supermarket for a short time or being outside doesn't normally expose to you a great amount of the virus, but if you're in an indoor, enclosed setting for a greater period of time especially with a large group of people, you could get exposed to a huge dose of it. I know hospitals carry the threat of a great amount of exposure (my uncle is currently hospitalized for non-covid-related kidney failure and they forbid us to visit him), and I'm wondering if it's that bad for doctors' offices and medical labs.
I did call the lab last week for info on precautions they're taking. They're having patients call them from their car in the parking lot and letting them know when to come up to the lab. They're also requiring them to wear masks (but not gloves, for some reason). That makes me feel a little better, but the radiology group where I'm having the mammogram done hadn't said anything when I called last month to reschedule (appt was originally on the 18th of April). I'm also wondering if I should reschedule my pulmonologist appt. Like I said this is just a yearly follow-up, it's not an urgent appt.
I'm just very uncomfortable about being in this type of setting three days in a row with the danger of being exposed again with this area still being a hot spot. One of the offices (primary care doctor I think) said their health care workers get tested daily, but I'm concerned about coming into contact with other patients who may be asymptomatic and could infect me. I'm 42 and no underlying chronic conditions (save for the very mild asthma which again I suspect I've outgrown) but I hear about people around my age who the media say are ""otherwise healthy"" becoming critically ill. I haven't left my house since the beginning of March when I'd seen my primary care doctor for an upper respiratory infection. I've gone outside walking my dogs in the neighborhood and exercising in my back yard, but I haven't gone shopping or anything like that...other family members have done so over the past 2 months and thankfully they haven't been sick. But again I'm concerned about the environment of the doctors' offices. Any advice? Should I cancel all the appts or maybe just keep 1?

"Our 23yr old son returns to our Chicago, IL apartment on Tues. 5/19/2020 from flying to South Padre, TX (beach vacation with a family from a western US state and several friends from here in Chicago, IL). My wife and I are in our 50s and healthy. I feel strongly about him needing to self-quarantine for 14-days in the front half of our apartment (own bedroom/bathroom); my wife and he disagree with me. I am also being told that unless we have symptoms, we don't have access to testing and won't for several more months. Any doctors out there who could recommend a best course of action (or what would you do in MY shoes)? Are there any resources/playbooks to guide us through having one household member in self quarantine?

"Am so frustrated - I thought I had recovered from Covid 19 as last week I was getting back to normal so returned to work yesterday after almost 3 weeks. Am a carer in a care home - after about 3 hours my chest started to tighten then all day I was on and off with breathing problems which the mask wouldn't have helped. I had to keep popping outside to get some fresh air. Recovered abit after resting thru lunch break but by end of shift I couldn't get my breathing under control and I now feel terrible and have stayed off today. Feel I am letting them down and guilty as when I am at home pottering around I am fine. When will this all end? Has anyone else had this prolonged problem?

"Hi all,
Thought I'll start a separate thread for this. I had a fever 10 weeks ago. The fever lasted 3 days but after the fever went I just simply struggled to sleep.
These days my sleeping is very poor, managing 4-7 hours on average of interrupted sleep. This is even with the help of melatonin.
I'm still fatigued and suffering some mild cold like symptoms after 10 weeks.
My trouble with sleeping is not helped by my anxiety. Doctor found I was extremely low on Vitamin D so now I'm taking supplements. The lack of Vitamin D may also have contributed to my sleeping problems and slow recovery.
Just wondering if anyone has the same sleeping problem with confirmed or suspected Covid-19? How are you coping?
What I mean is sleeping problems as a symptom of the virus or as an after-effect of the virus, not due to worry or anxiety.
Many thanks

"Good morning to all,
Since the start of the Covid-19, there have been many debates around the wearing of the mask, the use of hydro-alcoholic gels and other barrier gestures to put in place, but nothing about the door handles, which are vectors of invisible bacteria. Whether it is individuals, businesses or the medical sector, we should consider installing secure, sanitized and non-contact hand grips so that the hands do not come into direct contact with the handles.
Instead of using your hand as usual, you should be able to use your forearm, and even more precisely your elbow, by setting up the equivalent of a hand-free handle. This would avoid permanent disinfection of our door handles or opening with disposable towels, problematic for the environment...
Does this type of product already exist? Thank you for your answers!

"Six weeks ago on March 24 I developed symptoms of Covid-19, namely raised temperature (but not fever), dry cough, upset stomach and intense fatigue. As there was no possibility of a test, I have no certainty but as a key worker out and about in the community I am pretty certain it was the Coronavirus.
I still do not feel normal. I typically feel tired, although my daily walk and other physical activity do not seem to lead to real exhaustion. I find that work-related Zoom Conferences often provoke an episode of stomach upset and nausea. I sometimes feel mildly 'fluey' , with a minimal but discernible sore throat. My muscles are twitching rather than aching (although this has been diminishing in recent days). I generally sleep through the night and my appetite is only a little diminished. But I'm not getting that morning burst of energy and am sleepy for much of the day.
When the pandemic began, the advice was that people with mild symptoms were better after 14 days. So I wonder whether this is still the recovery period nearly two months on, whether it might be Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome or the beginning of something more long-term like CFS. Should I be trying to see my GP at this stage (if he will see me) or just keep going?
Thanks for reading this!

"I came down with Epstein-Barr virus many years ago, and have experienced many of the same symptoms that the victims of covid19 are experiencing, and many symptoms that they haven't, such as liver inflammation and delirium. Unfortunately, some may never fully recover from this virus, just like I never fully recovered from Epstein-Barr. Everyone's body is different. In my situation, it seemed to throw my immune system into overdrive and create all sorts of autoimmune disorders, and medical problems that are hard to diagnose. The ""malaise"" never seemed to end, even though the doctor said that it was all in my head. Chronic fatigue syndrome is something that many might also experience.

"Hi all,
Had a fever 9 weeks ago which lasted 3 days, then 3 days or so of green/yellow phlegm and 4-5 weeks of white phlegm.
Throughout this whole time I've been fatigued and worst of all have significant trouble sleeping. When the sleep problem started around 8 weeks ago there were nights when I couldn't sleep at all.
Now I manage anywhere between 4-8 hours of sleep a night. The sleep is very interrupted and not very good quality. Often I would take up after 1-2 hours and struggle to fall back asleep.
I also seem to be suffering post viral fatigue. I can manage daily activities no problems even incorporating some exercise (bike rides etc....), but when I exert myself I sometimes get a slight sore throat and runny nose, typical post viral fatigue symptoms. It seems sleep disturbance is another post viral fatigue symptom.
I did a CRP test 2 weeks ago and the doctor confirmed that the infection is gone, and I'm just feeling the after effects.
Anyone else going the same thing or having trouble sleeping?
Many thanks

"27 year old man, Tacoma WA. Healthy and Athletic - about a month ago I broke out in significant hives for the first time in my life. It started on my hand and worked its way in patches up my arm down my entire side, my stomach and my entire thigh and leg was completely covered with hives. My tongue swelled up and I thought it was just allergies, because I’ve never dealt with this before but I do have allergies. I have asthma, and I had trouble breathing for about a week. One day The hives completely went away and my breathing was back to normal. I went to urgent care and ask them if this had any connection with the coronavirus and she said no, but there was no medication for me besides Benadryl. Now I’m seeing that dermatologists are seeing a tie between COVID-19 and skin conditions. I also had symptoms of a lack of taste and it sort of felt like my mouth was burned as if I ate something hot the day before. Although I feel better now, could it have been COVID-19 after all?

"Hi I started with an occasional dry cough about 4 weeks ago. At this time I was still at work - I am a health care professional. Then the cough got worse and I developed a `low grade temperature of around 37 .5 (By the way - GP said not everyone gets the high temperatures) and felt tired and unwell and went on sick leave. This developed into a worse cough and shortness of breath and I was prescribed a course of Doxycycline antibiotics. Currently after 3 weeks off work I am feeling a lot better when sitting around doing not much or generally looking after myself, however if I exert myself a little ie taking my dog for a short walk - I am wheezing and short of breath. I feel bad for being off work as I know that my colleagues are stretched with sickness, but I am not sure if I am actually ready to go back and ready for an 8 hour shift at work???
