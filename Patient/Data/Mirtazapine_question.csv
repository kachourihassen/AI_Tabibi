"I was put on Remeron (mirtazapine) by an Egyptian doctor when I worked in Saudi Arabia a year and a half ago and suffered from GERD. He told me that it would remove the nausea and help me sleep. That it did. What I didn't realize though was how difficult it would be to quit it. I'm at my wits end so please anyone who successfully went off let me know and share your experience, I really need it.
I had a surgery for GERD, but retained some hypersensitivity and pain problems despite that. I was seen by some of the most brilliant surgeons in the US and they did all tests and concluded that my surgery was a success and I'm suffering from a functional problem now.
I already tried to discontinue Remeron 4 or 5 times. I even tried to taper it over a month or two, but when I go off of it completely within 7-8 days I get the same picture: terrible abdominal pains, heartburn, cramps, some diarrhea, hunger pains, excruciating upper back aches that strangely come and go suddenly, exhausting nausea, no sleep for days, tremors, sweating profusely many times a day, general fatigue, fever like condition, shakiness, dizziness,headaches and goosebumps, electric waves over my back and head, feeling of doom, complete desperation. I have never felt all of these symptoms at once before. In fact I have never felt some of them at all ever before.
Back in April the psychiatrist told me to take it every other day for 2 weeks and then just quit it. I tried that, and after 3 weeks of terrible suffering I gave in and went back on it again. I called and talked to the RNs and they just didn't seem to believe that it could be withdrawal.
As soon as I take 7.5 mg for a day or two, all the symptoms are gone, almost completely! It's amazing. It's the only medication I've been taking since I quit all acid meds in April, 2011.
My GI Doctor told me to stop Remeron and start taking Nortriptyline for dyspepsia. I wish I could!!!! I tried again and it's been 3 weeks now and I'm absolutely dying. Nortriptyline is helping a little to take the edge off the pain and nausea and insomnia, but the suffering is still too much. It's mostly physical, mostly abdominal symptoms although I get a fair share of the other symptoms listed as well.
I even have a feeling that I don't have any underlying gastric pathology and this all is related to withdrawals. Otherwise how could it clear with the first dose or two of Remeron? A while ago when I was tapering I felt very well on 7.5 mg every 3 days but when I stopped completely - after a week all the symptoms came back with a vengeance.
Desperately,
Roman

"Hi, just wondering if anyone can give me some guidance of what to expect during withdrawal from Mirtazapine.
I have been taking 15 mg for about 8 months then tapered to 7.5 for a month and 3.75 for another month. I stopped taking it completely 3 weeks ago. Mirtazapine has helped me with sleep and anxiety to some extent but the weight gain (17 pounds) is more than I was willing to put up with.
I had no withdrawal symptoms during tapering or for the first 10 days after stopping. Since then my sleep has been getting gradually worse and right now can barely sleep at all without sleeping pill. I'm also feeling very tearful and having lots of negative thoughts. My appetite has reduced slightly although haven't lost any weight yet (unfortunately)
So questions for anyone has been through it... When did your withdrawal symptoms 'peak' and then start to get better? How quickly did your ability to sleep come back? And how long did it take you to lose weight gained?
I appreciate that everyone has a different experience, but it would be helpful just to have some idea of what's to come! Starting to feel a bit desperate especially with the insomnia. Thanks

"i am trying to taper off of 7.5 mirtazapine and struggling. i was on it from march until june when i tried to get off of it. doc instructed to cut by 1/4 tablet every week, got off without much issue but 2 weeks later insomnia and could not sleep more than 2 hours a night. after 3 weeks with no sleep i went back on to 7.5 again. in hindsight i probably should have tried a smaller dose at that time. after stabilizing for a few weeks started tapering at a slower rate at the end of august. i have been reducing my dose by a small amount every two weeks and have just gotten down to a dose of .5. things are still a major struggle with each small cut. about day 4 after a cut everything starts, nausea, headache, anxiety, insomnia, back and hip pain and just all around feeling bad. looking for support or ideas on how to get through this. at what dose is it ok to just stop and go to zero. thanks for any help you can give me.

Been on mirtazapine for 6 weeks 15mg at night. Don't like the drug so wanting to get off but understand that quitting cold turkey is a bad idea. Can't speak to the doc until Monday and not prepared to keep taking the full dose any longer. Is cutting down to 7.5mg for a week too quick? Or should I take 3/4 and go from there? I am 100% starting the taper tonight but unsure of what dose to start.
I know everybody is different obviously so there is no way to predict how I will react but just wanted some advice.

"I have found it impossible to get of it so far. Even the slowest taper (3% at a time) gives me unacceptable bad withdraval. I am becoming increasily sick on mirtazapine. Pains in my whole body, extreme shortness of breath, headaches, insomnia, visual disturbances, no energy, bad brain fog, dizzyness ect. Lately I started having body tremors/pounding/shaking too. If I don't get of I really believe I don't have more then a couple years left, if even that. I am totally disabled by it, and I can't take it much more.
I was thinking If I can use another drug to help support me during a taper. Anybody have experience with this?

Since 2 years ago it has turned on me bad, and I am now close to bedridden most of the day. Zombie energy, all sorts of very scary visual disturbances, brain fog. constipation, dry skin, pains all over my body. internal pulsating tremors that torture me all day (those are probably THE worst) Bad shortness of breath. headaches, dizzyness, worsening tinnitus (I had pre-existing tinnitus) ect.
Each other month a new chronic symptom shows up and I am only getting worse and worse in a rapid pace. Tried a very slow taper a couple times, but couldnt pull it of. My sleep became complete crap and all I could do was lay in bed crying and I became a great danger to myself. This hell poison will be the end of me I really feel :´(
Its a damned if I do/damned if I don't situation: I can't taper of without highly probably killing myself and the longer I stay on it the closer I get to putting an end to it all as well, cause I have only a tini tiny bit of life quality left. I am only 35 but I feel like I am 90. Actually I know of 90 year olds with more mobility then me.

"For those of you struggling with your weight loss whilst taking this drug, I thought I’d tell you about my experience and conclusions.
I started on mirtazapine around 4 years ago for major depression and nausea/lack of appetite, and it worked really well for me, banishing my depression within days, and reviving my appetite and enjoyment of food. It also virtually cured my migraines, stopped my itching and IBS, and helped me sleep and cut my temazepam right back to around once a fortnight.
I quickly gained weight which I put down entirely to my increased appetite. I thought all those stories you here about not being able to lose weight despite cutting calories were just people underestimating how much they consumed. I was wrong.
After 6 months on the drug I had gained 26lb and none of my clothes fitted me. Despite cutting my food intake down, I kept gaining weight. In desperation, I came off mirtazapine cold turkey and suffered the most awful withdrawals. After ten days of hell, I was forced to go back on it. But I had dropped 7 lbs. I managed to keep my weight stable at 152-154lbs for two years. I couldn’t eat what I used to eat, but at least I was no longer gaining weight. Then in January this year, I saw a picture of myself in a bikini and hated the way I looked. I decided to seriously slim.
January 2015 I weighed 152lbs and cut my calories to between 1500 and 1800 a day. The weight fell off and I got down to 143lbs by March. I thought once again that mirtazapine was not affecting me being able to slim. I was wrong.
April 2015 I stalled, despite keeping to my diet. So I added a daily cardio work out. I actually GAINED weight!
July 2015 I still weighed in at around 143lbs as I had lost the weight I gained in April but after 7 months was no further on than I was back in March. I was forced to recalculate my maintenance level of calories from 2000 down to 1800. I have an active job and being 5 ft 10, I should need more calories than this to maintain my weight. I realised then that mirtazapine was interfering with either my metabolic rate, or my ability to burn fat or both. I still couldn’t lose any weight.
August 2015 I cut out alcohol which meant that I had effectively cut my calories still further and I have lost a further 2lbs. I now weigh 141 lbs.
Conclusion:
Mirtazapine affected my weight by increasing my appetite AND by some other means, probably slowing my metabolism and interfering with my fat burning process. You CAN lose weight on mirtazapine, but it is much harder than if you are not on it. Is it worth it? Well yes, for me it is. It has turned my life around for the better. I love it, and I hate it. I love it for helping me fight my depression, sleep well, be free of migraines and IBS, and not have to take antihistamines daily for my itching. I hate it for forcing me to stay on a rigid diet with very few indulgences, and for being such a difficult drug to kick.

"**Anyone who reads this please do not go cold-turkey from this medication**
I have tried to come off this medication once -- I went cold-turkey without realizing what it would do. I wasn't informed about the withdrawal symptoms I would get if I tried to stop it and If I had known before taking it I never would have considered taking this medication. When I went cold-turkey my following symptoms were;
Insomnia.
Vomiting.
Rapid weight loss.
Panic attacks.
High-anxiety.
Depersonalization.
Derealization.
Heart-palpitations.
I was off the medication for about two weeks and I couldn't take it anymore so I went back on it. I was on 15MG for three years, I cut down to 7.5MG when I went back onto Mirtazapine and this is my fourth year on it. Anyone who says 7.5mg isn't doing anything, you're very mistaken because this dosage helps me sleep and has caused me to put on a lot of weight, too. Now I want off it -- but my question is, how do I exactly come off this medication without experiencing what I did before? I need like a guide on how much I should cut down each week or something, and I cannot speak to my GP about this because as far as I'm concerned my GP isn't well informed about this medication because my GP's advice was to stop taking it after 3 days which I did and then I had that hell experience and he actually wanted me to not go back on it. So I am doing this solo, I just need a helping hand.

"Unknown to me, my wife started taking mirt a year ago (15mg) and I only found out about 3 months ago. My wife is usually a very kind and loving person, but over the past year she has changed dramaticly. Over the past year my wife started to have nightmares where I would be woken to her screams, she has a developed a very short temper and becomes very angry with me, it seems like I can't do anything without upsetting her, she has started swearing (the ""F"" word) and even has spoken antiracially which is very out of charactor (she would normally tell someone off for speaking that way). Whats most upsetting is my wife has gone from someone who loves me so much (this is one of her facebook posts from 7 months ago "" 33 Years ago ( 1982 ) When I was 14 years old I fell in love with this gorgeous guy .... Love him just as much today as I did all those years ago "" ) to moving out 8 weeks ago. A week ago she accused me of grabbing her and pushing her against the wall and punching the wall, which never happened (I am guessing it was one of her nightmares). Worst of all is our 5 year old daughter is in the middle of it all. She has been in tears asking me why mummy and daddy aren't living together any more. There is more that has happened but this post is getting too long. Suffice to say I am very depressed and upset at what is happening in my life. Has anyone else had similar problems? is there a chance that if she stops taking mirt that she will return to her old self? (I did at one stage mention that  her meds could be doing this and she bit my head off instantly). What can I do to turn this situation around? Is Mirtazapine causing this?
Please someone help because every time I try  it only gets worse!!!

"Hi All,
I am a 21 year old located in london. I have been on mirtazapine for roughly 3 months now, maybe a little longer. I started on these due to a struggle to sleep on a night leading into daytime anxiety.
I am now not struggling at all, been through a break up and battled a new job in a new city. I have never felt better than what I do now.
I have however noticed that i have struggled with low libido and show less emotions than what i was doing before i started taking them.
I am now at a point where i do not have anxiety nor trouble sleeping and would like to come off them. I have sat and read all the negative withdrawal symptoms but i would like some positive feedback from someone in a similar scenario to myself. I really want to get off these now and enjoy my life to the max!

"I wanted to write my story for anyone out there trying to find encouragement during withdrawal process. When I started coming off Mirt I kept searching for success stories, but forums are usually filled with struggle stories instead. If you are in the weeds of withdrawal, may be this post will give you a little bit of hope. 
I was put on 15mg of Mirtazapine in January of 2017. My main symptom at the time was severe insomnia: 0 sleep for days, may be 5-6 hours of sleep in a week. But I also experienced episodes of terrible anxiety, bordering panic and depression symptoms. Looking back, I'm convinced this was brought on by a few weeks of continuous Ambien and Xanax use for sleep. I was 36 at the time, never had any psychological issues before, never took any meds. I was suffering for about a month until I found a doctor who stabilized me with Mirt. 
It worked almost immediately. Within one week I started sleeping for the first time in a month. Anxiety and depression faded as sleep returned. I was on 15 mg for 2 weeks, but I felt too sedated the next day. Went down to 7.5mg after 2 weeks. Then down to 5mg after another 2 weeks. And from there on did a 0.5 reduction every 2 weeks or so. Finally jumped off after being at 0.5mg for 5 days. 
I had some rebound insomnia with earlier tapers, but once I got below 4 mg it was pretty smooth (because of the lower reduction, I guess?). When I jumped off back in June for the first 10 days I felt great. But slowly sleep started getting worse and worse: and at 2 week mark it hit me hard. 
I went back to 1mg and stayed there for a coupe of months – sleep normalized immediately. I got 0.2 and 0.1 mg pills and decided to go as slow as I can. In the end I took way longer than I should have, but I was going through some life-changing transitions at the time and insomnia was not something I was prepared to deal with. It took me about 6 month to go from 1mg to 0.1mg, doing 0.1mg cuts every few weeks. Then I was taking 0.1mg every other day for a few weeks. Then every 2 days for 2 weeks and then I stopped. I had a few setbacks during this time, but not as troubling as the ones I had before: only 1-2 nights of bad sleep.
It's been 2 month since my last dose and I think I'm ready to say: I'm Mirt free and I sleep well!
So if you are taking this medication for SLEEP here's some advice I can offer:
1. In my experience, lower doses of the pill worked just as well – or better – than the original 15 or 7.5mg. From what I've read 3.5mg seems to be the perfect dose for sleep for most people. I did great on 1mg as well: asleep within 15 minutes, which is very fast for me even before insomnia problems. So if your doctor prescribes it for sleep, I suggest trying the lowest possible dose: it will be easier to withdraw from later. 
?2. When stopping this medication go slow and and jump off from the lowest dose possible. In a lot of the stories I've read people have jumped off from 3.5, 5 or even 7.5 mg. This medication seems to have effect even at 1mg (at least for some people). I took too long, but I'm guessing you should be ok going from 1mg to 0.1mg in month or so. You can either make your own solution or find a compounding pharmacy that will prepare small dose pills for you.
3. Expect delayed withdrawal. I was usually hit with insomnia 10-14 days after lowering the dose and it seems to match other stories I've read. 
Click here to view image
5. And lastly, try not to fight for sleep when insomnia does strike. It's easier said than done. But fighting make things much-much worse: it adds anxiety and sadness on top of exhaustion. And will most definitely not make you sleep. When it's 3 am and you just know sleep will not come tonight – just try to accept it. The truth is that we are built to handle some sleep deprivation. Yes, you will not feel great the next day. But usually it's not as bad as you think it will be when you are laying there awake in the middle of the night. And worrying about it will not make you fell better. 
If you are fighting the insomnia fight right now – hang in there!
?Unfortunately, there's no short cut. But it will get better.

"In a month I will have come off mirtazapine completely and for some of that time I have been able to work and do my job pretty darn well.
I went on mirtazipine for anxiety and it did not work and I put on 1 stone in weight was drowsy all the time and generally doped out. In some ways it was actually causing more anxiety and depression as well. Withdrawing from mirtazapine is different for every person and everyone has to go at their own pace. For me, it was extremely slowly when I got down to 7.5mg and lower. The tablets don't allow you to do this so request the mirtazapine solution that you dispense with a 1ml syringe into a little bit of water every night. Going cold turkey is a terrifying experience, the one most awful experience of my life and its also dangerous. I do not agree with people advocating taking valium during the withdrawal process because for anxious or depressed people a drug that powerful leaves you vulnerable to addiction because speaking from personal experience that is exactly what happened to me. Valium in my experience is nowhere near as hard to withdraw from than mirtazipine because it is so short term whereas the mirtazipine is a long drawn out business making it hard to lose perspective on what is a withdrawal symptom and what is your underlying problem. I kept a diary of my symptoms so I could look objectively at what I was experiencing and sort it out, but I still forget sometimes. As I said earlier about some of the time I have been able to work Im talking about the past 6 months where I have been following a plan devised by myself that works if you find the quicker withdrawals like \""half a table for a week then nothing\"" or cold turkey dont work. There is a website by the organisation called CITA (google it) and they have a Back To Life handbook that you pay £13 for and it gives you a specific plan for mirtazipine withdrawal, tells you supplements to take such as the powerful detox drink Noni Juice, how to alter your diet to help decrease withdrawal symptoms. I had my vitamins tested and whereas before the process I was fine, afterwards I had a chromium deficiency making me very sensitive to sugar. If you can hack it I have found that a low carb, low sweetner, low sugar diet like the Atkins or the Dukan diet work very well as the mirtazipine plays around with your blood sugar levels and therefore makes you even more unstable. My basic way of withdrawing was this:
Ill use the drop from 0.1ml to 0ml (of syringe solution which with the 7.5mg solution equates to about 0.75mg very very tiny!!) as an example because that is what I am doing right now:
Week 1, take 0.1ml apart from wednesday when you take nothing
Week 2, take 0.1ml apart from monday and wednesday \""\""\""
Week 3, take 0.1ml apart from monday, wednesday and friday \""\""\""
Week 4, take 0.1ml apart from monday, wednesday, friday and sunday
Week 5, take 0.1ml apart from monday, tuesday, wednesday, friday and saturday (only take 1ml on thursday and sunday)
Week 6, take 0.1ml only on thursday.
week 7 , take nothing!
So each week you are cutting out one day of the week's dose which I have found really suits mirtazapine because if you just drop down a dose the withdrawal hits you really hard 2 weeks after and by 3 weeks on the dose I was horrifically depressed. If its too fast you can do the week 1 pattern for 2 weeks etc which I did for a while. I do see what they mean about mirtazapine having a short half life because it does hit you in the face at the 3 weeks marker, it is as if it just leaves the body very quickly between 2 and 3 weeks of dropping a dose. The gradual withdrawal that I ended up doing I think really suits mirtazipine because of this aspect.
The drop downs I did was, 30mg, 15mg, 7.5mg (half a tablet) (with the tablets I simply dropped the dose again when the withdrawal symptoms subsided) this bit was debilitating and I do not advocate it. Use the plan set out in the Back To Life booklet instead. When I tried to go to nothing from 7.5 then I experienced absolute horribleness. So I switched to solution and did 1ml (7.5mg), 0.9ml, 0.8ml, 0.7ml, 0.6ml etc etc down to 0.1ml which Im doing now. I got the solution from my GP so it is not hard to obtain it in the UK, it costs the same as a regular prescription, i think it is available in America aswell but im not too sure.
Finally i will just outline my withdrawal symptoms: vivid dreams, disrupted sleep/over-sleeping (I did a test using SleepCycle, an app for the iPhone to test whether a small dose of mirtazipine could affect my sleeping and I found with the analysis tool that I had much less deep sleep and was much more easily disturbed to being fully awake during the night than when I didnt take any mirtazipine. I think this is why you oversleep on mirtazipine.) Paranoia, itching skin, body shocks (like tingles that run from the top of your head to your toes), headaches, fatigue, bruxism or teeth grinding (can make my jaw ache), depression, anxiety, nausea, burning mouth syndrome (like a numb tingling in your tongue), floating sensations when going to sleep, cravings for sugar and carbs, confusion, forgetfulness, angry outbursts, irritability, hot/cold flashes, insomnia (the most disturbing for me but on my really slow plan I dont get this problem at all), social withdrawal (probably because my emotions were so erratic i was embarassed for anyone to see me), body aching especially in my back where I hold most of my tension, sensitivity to noise and light, blurred vision.
Some more tips: People often fear it is their illness coming back when they are experiencing withdrawal symptoms, this was not true for me because as I am nearly off mirtazipine now it is the best I have felt since I started taking antidepressants. They are only supposed to be used short term but I ended up on them for 6 years. If you felt no effect with the antidepressants after a few months it is best to come off them. Dont even risk it with drinking alcohol, it makes the withdrawal even worse, your body is going through a lot and it needs as little rubbish to deal with as possible. If you feel a burst of energy as I have done during this process even if it is 9pm go for a jog. Dont just sit around waiting for it to turn into a panic attack. And finally go with the flow and remember its not real and only temporary. \""This too shall pass.\"" So just do your best at real life and hibernate through it all. This drug is not easy to come off just as all antidepressants are hard to come off, it has been compared to heroin withdrawal and having researched heroin withdrawal I agree with the comparison. If you drop too suddenly and end up seeing the doctor because you are suicidal and at your wits end you must slow down and dont let them just pump you back up to 30mg, just go back up to the last dose you took before you went crazy and go slower next time. A word of warning: the majority of GPs and doctors do not understand antidepressant withdrawal and from my experience neither do psychiatrists fully, they just prescribe. However you must not blame them for their ignorance even though it is hard not to when you are in hell, you put the drugs in your mouth so YOU have to get yourself rid of them at YOUR pace. It is sadly the ways things are in the UK at the moment.
The best of luck to anyone who is on this road.
I hope something I said in there helped you.
If it didn't nothing lost!
Kathryn.

I have crippling morning anxiety and zero appetite, the weight gained on Mirt has fallen off! I also feel sick most of the day. I got so down last week that I very nearly went back on it, but couldn't bare the thought of coming off again! Insomnia has just kicked in too. 
I don't mean to post this to scare anyone, as when I was at my darkest Mirt really helped me. I just wanted to know if there's anyone out there going through what I'm going through? Any advice? How long can it last? 
I'd appreciate any help x

"as it seems common my psychiatrist greatly underestimated mirtazapine withdrawal. i cut from 15 to 7.5mg then to 0 a week later and paid the price with insomnia and debilitating anxiety and heart palpitations. i went back on 7.5mg and stabilized but still sometimes need to use hydroxyzine and or unisom to get to sleep. how can i best taper off 7.5 mg to minimize withdrawal effects? cutting 10% a month is infeasible so looking for alternate ideas. i read cut in half for 10 days, then take 1/2 every other day for 10 days, then every 3rd day for 10 days, then stop. can anyone corroborate this approach or offer suggestions? thanks!

"I have been on mirtazapine for 8 months. It's really great for sleep but even at the tiny dose I've been taking (3.75mg) I get the munchies, the generally irritability/ flares of anger and headaches. I think I'm just very sensitive to whatever is in it as I've tried to up my dose to 7.5 and can't bear it.
I wanted to get off it so I tried to switch to another A/D but immediately started with symptoms similar to a UTI. After 3 attempts I've come to the conclusion that it's the withdrawal from mirtazapine that's causing this. Has anyone else had this?
And how do you withdraw from such a low dose?
I've seen from this forum that others have had success in getting off mirtazapine when they do it slowly, but I got the impression that my 3.75 dose was the point at which others 'jump off'.
I'd be very grateful to hear of other peoples experiences and any advice those who have been there can offer. Thank you everyone.

"So like the title says, i need to know if any of you while on mirt and after coming off of it had this exact problem or im just the only one.
The story is: on October 27 i began to have feelings of a UTI , on nov 1 i went to the hospital because i couldnt take it anymore and they did a urine test, 3 blood test and a ct scan. Everything came clear, i only appeared to have a very small infection, so i started antibiotics and at day 3 weirdly the infection went away but i still had the symptoms of a UTI . I on my on decided to do 3 more urine test, cultive urine test and 2 blood test for cancer and all came clear , just some yeast infection and crystals. the yeast infection went away and i dont know about the crystals. The thing is even after all coming clear i still had the same problem and getting worst. so i stopped mirt at 0.7 this 11 and now things are a bit better, some days better than others but still not gone. The main symptoms are frequency , back then retention and some irritation and bladder pressure. Where i live which its not usa, those are the only test i can do since the other are extreamly expensive. i did made an appointment with my ginecologist but its for may of 2022. So what i want to know is if any of you got something like this. i do notice that if i eat something sweet or milk it flares so im in a very strict diet. plz dont leave scary comments of illness since i know about that i just need to know if anyone can relate and send tips or something that could help? thank you.

"Hello
I recently tried to start a super slow taper of mirtazapine, because Ive found myself getting more and more ill on this drug. I tried to only taper 3% off, as Ive tried a faster taper before (5-10% at a time) and know the withdravals are B.R.U.T.A.L on this drug!!
About 1-2 weeks later I started having heart palpatations, but not in the traditional way it feels like. Its like a mixture between heart palpatations, trembling, pounding, jitters and vibration in my chest which spreads down my legs. Sometimes its more pronounced in my chest, sometimes in my legs and sometimes in both. Its VERY uncomfortable and I freaked out and went back to my normal dose mirtazapine. Ive now been on that almost 3 weeks but these heart problems or what it is, has not gotten any better.
Has anybody experinced this. I am scared and I cant take this. The constant trembling, vibrating, pounding ect. makes me dizzy and nauseous and unable to relax at all. Sometimes its so bad that I get winded just from doing very light yoga. I am bedbound from it a lot. I am gonna go to the doctor, but I want to know if anybody can relate??

"Hi, I never actually stopped Mirtazapine, but I had to take an antibiotic Rifampin for latent TB that reduces and clears Mirtazapine faster. My first meal after my first dose of Rifampin I got tingling in my lips and face while eating what I later learned was a high histamine meal. That continued a number of times with meals that were high histamine, so I have been eating low histamine (the same three meals every day) for 6 months. I've been off Rifampin for two months, I could feel the Mirtazapine sleep effect come back after two weeks so a couple weeks ago I tried some higher histamine foods again including avocado and the next morning while eating (actually one of my safe meals) broke out into a rash on my face neck and hands. So I guess it still isn't safe. I've seen two allergists and think I am on my own on how to handle this. thanks.

"Hi everyone,
I am really suffering with anxiety at the moment, I was on 15mg of mirtazipine for about 4 months, previous to that I was on 45mg of mirtazipine .. quit cold turkey because I couldn't deal with the weight gain and how depressed I was feeling, It was also interfering with me taking care of my one year old as I was extremely tired all of time.
Anyway! around 5 weeks ago I spoke to my dr about having the same concerns as before since being on the 15mg, she told me to try prozac I was on that for 6 days and suffered with extreme chest pain, sweating, increased heart rate and I even passed out! I spoke to my dr again and she said to stop all medication as I may have suffered with mild serritonin syndrome.
The first few days were hell, I was having severe chest pain, tearful spells, increased heart rate, shooting pains and I was experiencing upper back pain too. My dr had sent me for a 24 hour ecg which luckily I had while having these withdrawals and the results came back that my heart is healthy, its my breathing that is causing my heart to beat fast or flutter, ie panic.
I have also had a chest x ray, a couple of normal ecgs and a blood test and they have all come back fine apart from I'm mildly anaemic so have been prescribed iorn tablets.
Now I have been concerned because my dr says there is no issue with my heart, but I have a pressure feeling on the front of my chest and also in my upper back, I get shooting pains down my left arm and into my fingers occasionally, the shooting pains are sometimes in my legs too. I feel like my vision isn't quite right, like im a little sensitive, I have a odd taste in my mouth, I also get chest tightness and my left arm will feel heavy at the joint .. my dr has said it's all anxiety related ans has offered me to try more medication but to be honest I didn't suffer with any physical symptoms before the medication, maybe just a tight chest when I had a panic attack .. but this is daily!
Thank you for having a read and any advice is welcomed, im a 29 year old stay at home mum so I don't really get the chance to talk to many people about this, let alone anyone who suffers from similar.

"I am currently suffering with chronic depression and anxiety. I have been suffering badly for 6 months. Which has deteriorated into chronic depression where i am currently being overseen by a psychiatrist in my local crisis team. I have been taking Mirtazapine 15mg for 4 weeks. I then upped the dose to 22.5mg for 3 days and now i have been on 30mg for 5 days. I am still extremely severly depressed.
I am looking for people to give me their stories on if I need to wait to have been at 30mg for 2 weeks before noticing an improvement.
I also have headaches and sinus problems since starting the Mirt but i am willing to deal with those if it means getting better. As i have 3 amazing children and a loving wife, who are desperately needing their Dad/Husband to get better.

"Hi all,
I have been struggling with severe anxiety resulting in insomnia, depression and lack of appetite (all those things we hate about anxiety).
I was prescribed 30mg mirtazapine nearly 4 weeks ago now, but I have been breaking them in half and taking 15mg as I'm terrified of medication, and know that the lower doses are better for sleep.
I'm still getting a lot of anxiety, and still have no appetite. I feel nauseous all day and sometimes even the sight of food makes me queasy. (I so wish i had that increased appetite side effect as I'm already really underweight!). Been feeling increasingly more and more depressed these last few days.
I also feel like this has really flared up my IBS and i have a lot of wind all the time, especially in the mornings.
Does anyone with experience with this drug know if these things will get better if i did up my dose to 30mg? I have read that some get more anxious on 30mg than on 15mg and thats the last thing i need right now!
Last night I split the pills and worked out a 22.5mg dose and was close to taking it but chickened out because I was worried it would make the insomnia and anxiety worse at that dose.
what should I do? give the 15mg more time before making any decisions or take the 30mg?
thank you

I've read withdrawal peaks around the 3/4week mark, so I'm trying to stay positive that it will pass.

"Hello all!
I see a lot of taper / withdrawal threads on here explaining how bad it was for a lot of people but I wanted to share my experience with a relatively easy taper so those who google it don’t get completely terrified / hopefully it helps some people.
I was on mirtazapine for GAD and Panic Disorder for four years, 30mg for three and 45g for the final year. It helped a great deal in the beginning but the last six months or so I felt I was getting no benefits, so I decided to come off.
Here are my tips before I log my experience.
BE FIRM with your doctor. For too long I was pressured to stay on or even maximise my dose when I was unhappy. Tell your doctor you want off and you want off now and come up with a GAME PLAN.
GET ANTI-NAUSEA MEDS this one is simple, be prepared. I got a script for Maxolon from my doc to take twice a day during my withdrawal. It’s completely safe and non addictive and works wonders.
SET YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS you can do this. I personally have been through Valium (diazepam) withdrawal and it was horrifying, so with that experience behind me I knew this would be do-able. HAVE FAITH in yourself and your inner strength.
SYMPTOMS WILL PASS. The good thing is you know it is the withdrawal that is making your anxiety flare up or making you feel uneasy so you KNOW you can get through it and it will end.
So here comes my experience.
Had been on 45mg for a year (out of 4 on this med) and told my doctor I want off and I want off ASAP. They were aware of my success coming off diazepam so were supportive of me coming off this relatively quickly (I really earned my drug withdrawal stripes there haha).
45mg down to 30mg for five days. I took my anti-nausea pill when I woke up straight away and another in the evening if I needed. Honestly felt ZERO bad effects from this drop at all, if anything I felt better. Less violent anxiety, clearer head and happier mood.
30mg down to 15mg for five days. Kept taking those wonderful Maxolons and again this was a walk in the park!! Happier every day and really focussing on how much success I was having so far.
15mg down to 7.5mg for five days. Still on Maxolon every day to avoid the nausea. Had some days where anxiety would flare up quickly but that’s kind of normal for me anyway. Found on this low dose I was falling asleep so fast I had forgotten how sedating the low doses were!
7.5mg to 0 for the rest of my life. Still on Maxolon, have been noticing I still feel some nausea so I am grateful to have the anti-nausea meds to really minimise it. Have been taking 2 daily during this time. My sleep is becoming a bit more broken and less of a “coma” deep sleep now and I’ve been sweating bullets at random but DRINKING LOADS OF WATER.  STILL FEELING POSITIVE!!
I am now 3 days into 0mg and honestly it’s nowhere near as bad as a lot of people experienced and for that I am extremely grateful. Will update if people are interested to read how the next few days / weeks go now that I’m down to no mirt in my system.  It has been so much easier than I was braced for.
So here are a list of things I did experience.
Mild Nausea despite taking the anti nausea meds
Pooping more than usual
Some sleep disruption once I came off completely
Sweating
Mild headache (easily fixed by ibuprofen)
Flare ups of anxiety but NO PANIC ATTACKS caused by withdrawal, if anything my panic attacks are less frequent now
Feeling a little foggy headed once I got down to zero, not a big deal
Jitters. Just general fidgeting and struggling to sit still but that’s expected after being sedated big time for the last four years by a variety of meds now I’m on zero medications.
Things I NEVER EXPERIENCED
(I’m not saying these don’t happen but merely they did not happen to me)
Vomiting
Diarrhoea
Insomnia (I still sleep every night)
Brain Zaps
Migraines
Panic attacks caused by withdrawal
Suicidal thoughts / depression. I’m actually much happier.
Dizziness / feeling faint. Again this is less frequent now than it was while I was on 45mg.
Bad mood changes, being angry or crying for no reason.
So to anyone who bothered to read this essay post. YOU CAN DO IT. Everyone will experience these things differently and I am not disputing that some people have a really rough time, it’s just that when someone has a good experience or an easy time they are less likely to write about it. When I was starting my taper I found so many awful stories and so few positive ones which made me extremely anxious in itself. So I wanted to write out a successful withdrawal story for those people who are about to start to see that they might not have a horrifying experience and there are ways you can prevent a lot of the symptoms SAFELY.
Drink lots of water. Have faith in yourself. Be strong. Don’t put up with sh*t you don’t have to.
I am more than happy to reply to any questions people have about my experience and will update how things go for the next few days if anyone is interested. Cheers and good luck.

"I have stopped mirtazapine 10 weeks ago at the beginning of April after tapering off from 15 mg since December 2019. I went faster than recommended because I had no major issues in lowering the doses first to 7.5 then to 3.75 and 1.875. After 1.875 I dropped 0.1 mg every 3-4 days till reaching 0.1 then jumped off. Normally I expected the rebound insomnia to appear and it did at 0.4 mg. After stopping completely the first 3 weeks and a half I slept around 3-4 hours per night in one block being unable to fall asleep again once waking up (usually around 3 am). After that period I started to have random nights with longer sleep (5, 6 even 7 hours) but in the last two weeks things went wrong again coming under 5 hours and constantly waking up around 4.30 - 5.00 with a very strange feeling that I am not able to describe in words. It's like I am shaken by an electrical burning without being able to determine where it starts and where it ends and once awake I feel weak, trembling and somehow anxious. I have to get out of the bed and start moving around waiting 1-2 hours till I get better. I checked on the forums about this feeling and I may think about a spike in cortisol that is waking me up. I did a blood check at 08.00 in the morning and the level of cortisol was in range but very close to the upper limit.
During withdrawal I am already using a variety of supplements to help like magnesium glicinate, holy basil extract, l-theanine, lemon balm, ashwagandha, b and d vitamins and for the nights when I cannot fall asleep naturally I took valerian but it is effective for me only in dose larger than 600 mg which is affecting the stomach and gallbladder. I also do a lot of breathing and mindfulness meditation.
Any ideas about this strange morning feeling or similar experience during withdrawal ?

"Hi there,
I've been suffering from depression and have been experiencing sleeping problems over the last few months - I was prescribed Mirtazapine 30mg. I took my first tablet last night and almost immediately felt woozy, the same kind of feeling you get on ecstasy. I fell asleep almost straight away and had a good night's sleep but this feeling of wooziness hasn't gone away. I feel as if I am slurring my words and can't keep my eyes open at work, furthermore, I can't stop eating!
A colleague has suggested I split the tablets and just take half each night, would you recommend this? Or should I ask for another anti-D? I'm only 17 and understand that Mirtazapine is not really recommended for under 18s, wondering if this is why I'm reacting badly.

"3 weeks ago i was sent to AnE due to a panic attack and anxiety it was the weekend and was prescribed zoplicone and referred to the gp. The next Monday the doctor prescribed me 20mg citalopram and propananol. Within a few hours of taking the medication my panic attack intensed along with chest pain. By that evening I was halloucinating, i went back to the gp the following day who advised this is normal and can last up to two weeks before the tablets work. By the next day my halloucinations were worse and I began hearing voices telling me to kill myself. I lasted 6 days on these tablets before I stopped. I am now 7 days off the tablets and although my halloucinations have stopped I am still hearing voices. On friday I went back to the gp who dismissed my symptoms saying ""these things happen"" I was advised to rest for another week before making another appointment. I am now extremely scared as these symptoms were not present prior to me starting the medication and I thought given I have been off them for a week they would have subsided. Does anyone have any advise on who I should see/contact? My gp surgery do not seem interested and I have seen 4 different doctors throughout this ordeal. I have a young family and just want my old life back. I am desperate but dont know where to seek help.

Anyone have any similar experiences after this dose drop? I'm wondering if its normal or if I'm going crazy with worsening depression

I've been on mirtazapine for only two weeks. Started at 3.75mg and increased to 7.5 mg after one week. My tinnitus and ear fullness is now so bad I want to stop. Would I need to taper after only two weeks on such a low dose ????

"Hi i have been reading all these thrads on here about mirtazapine and its withdrawl symptoms and it really is a nightmare drug.
I literally only took a half dose last weekend (7.5mg) and within one hour I had a headache, dry mouth and worst of all i had really bad aches in my joints that pretty much prevented me from walking, every time i tried to bend over to get something i felt like i was going to fall over. i also experienced dizzy spells like motion sickness without the nausea. This was last Saturday, sunday was just as bad.. all day in bed (after these side effects i was determined i would not touch this medicine again), on monday thankfully the pains in my joints subsided a bit and i was able to walk again with relative ease but the motion sickness/dizziness started to get worse, since tuesday the motion sickness dizziness (feels like i'm going to lose my balance) has gotten worse and stayed the same.
I have no idea if these are withdrawl symptoms? i literally only took one dose of 7.5mg and that's it nothing else! i spoke to my gp various chemists and manufacturers of the drug and they all tell me that it should be out of my system now and they don't know what the issue is and that withdrawl symptoms shouldn' occur because i only took a small half dose!
but reading the threads on here i'm seeing lot of you have similar symptoms but to a much greater degree.
How long do these withdrawl symptoms last for?? I would never have taken this poison drug had i known all these effects would occur. literally as i write this i feel as if everything is swaying slightly, loss of balance. since yesterday i've developed some mild muscle twitching.
they just said i was hyper sensitive to this drug hence why i have these side effects adn that the half life is realtively long 40-65 hours noted, im a young male 33 so i shouldn't be having these issues.
I have't found a thread where anyone has come off mirt and no longer feels any withdrawl symptoms. has anyone been off mirt and managed to eliminate all withdrawl symptoms or is this going to affect us for years to come?

"i have been tapering off mirtazapine for a couple months now and wondering if anyone else was. i was on a dose of 7.5 for a couple months when doc told me to cut dose by 1/4 every ten days, then off. three weeks later i had to reinstate as i couldnt sleep more than 2 hours a night for three weeks i had been off. after stabilizing back on 7.5 for six weeks i started a slower taper, that was end of august. since then i have been making small cuts every week and am now on a dose of 2.2mg. i get nausea, anxiety, tinnitus, headaches, muscle pain especially hips and back and insomnia with each cut. just wondering if anyone else has tapered or is tapering off mirtazapine and how they are doing it and what they are experiencing. thanks.

"Hi everyone,
There are already so many discussions on Patient.info about Mirtazapine withdrawal and a lot of good information but I felt like I needed to get my own discussion going to help myself on the journey and help others.
I've been on Mirtazapine for just over two years but I am wanting to get off it due to not wanting to be on any psychiatric drug at all. I know they help some people and a lot of people stay on them longer but I feel that the longer you are on them, the harder the withdrawal journey can be if you are susceptible to it.
I've tried three times to withdraw from Mirtazapine:
1. Summer 2017 - I went from 30mg to 15mg but within a week I just didn't feel right and people would mention it in work, ""are you ok, you look pale"". I just felt like the flu was coming, a heaviness was gaining ground. So I went back up to 30mg and the next day all them symptoms were gone.
2. Winter 2017 - probably not best time of year to withdraw, the dark evenings sure at to any negative feelings. I went from 30mg to 22.5mg (held for two weeks) and then dropped down to 15mg during a week off work. About 4-5 days later I began to feel a heaviness in my chest, the next day the feeling was more pronounced. I said to myself, ""i'm going to go back up to 30mg tonight and see what happenes"". 
The next day, the heaviness was GONE completely BUT something happened to me that had never happened to me before, I woke up before my alarm. I remember looking at the time and thinking 'that is odd, I always sleep right through to my alarm'. The following night is when it all kicked off. I went to bed around 10:30pm, taking 15mg, adamant to continue with my taper. Two hours went by and I was not sleeping. So I caved in and took the other 15mg, but....three hours went by and I was still wide awake. I started to panic and get heart palpitations, which become more and more pronounced until I was up and pacing the house. The following week became the toughest week of my life, going three days without sleep at one point, despite being given various sleeping tablets.
January 2018  - looking back, I probably should have gone back on 30mg and stayed on that dose until this day. That would have been 6-8 weeks ago but when you have insomnia, you first begin by trying to figure out 'why' and then 'how'. During the toughest times, you make the rashes decisions (big dose reductions).
So I had planned to go much slower, I went from 30mg to 26.25mg for a week and then down to 22.5mg, which went OK until about 4-5 days later again, Insomnia was back. 
I guess one way of looking at it is, I went from 30mg to 22.5mg within three weeks, which is a 25% drop, which is actually a big drop when it comes to the brain and body having to re-adjust without the chemical it has been fed for so long! I do ask myself though, how the hell did I even manage to get all the way down to 15mg before getting symptoms but in reality, that was over about 3-4 weeks, it was just a 50% reduction, hence a bigger reaction!
I look back at my use of Mirtazapine and I had been on 45mg at one point, not long though and I was on 15mg for a fair few months but spent 80% of my treatment time (2 years) on 30mg.
It's crazy how much you doubt yourself at first though, my GP's first response was to immediately up the dose to 45mg. Which I stuck to, for about 2 days, before panic and a failure to improve my symptoms lead me to asking myself whether the medication had 'pooped out' - I will be honest with you, I still regularly ask myself that but have to remined myself. 30mg worked well until I tried to get of it, by that though I mean I was sleeping fine (no insomnia) but felt well enough mentally to want to come off the meds. The sleep benefits in reality was the only reason I stayed on for so long.
So here I am, currently suffering with an inability to get to sleep and maintain sleep. The getting to sleep is driven by some bizarre adrenaline surges that start as soon as a sleep start begins (as I drift off), it feels as if I stop breathing momentarily (completely natural) but my body reacts in fear (adrenaline) and my heart begins to race. But this is NON-STOP, literally every time I try go to sleep and apparently this is exacerbated by sleep deprivation, so one big vicious cycle that takes some fixing - I've done it once, I WILL DO IT AGAIN!
I've upped my dose again and my plan is to go MUCH MUCH SLOWER and take it MONTH BY MONTH. I think that Mirtazapine is clearly having a massive impact on the receptors responsible for sleep, as well possibly impacting adrenaline/cortisol. So when removed, the body cannot cope by itself (at least not yet).
I haven't experienced any other symptoms at the moment, which is not like the first times, right now it's just insomnia. Hence why I often doubt myself.
So I plan to first, hold on a regular dose (30mg) and see if my sleep improves over the next month. Is anyone else going through Mirtazapine withdrawal now? Or have you been there and conquered it? Let me know, more people to chime in the better.

"Have now been on Mirtazapine for 7 weeks and am seeing GP tomorrow as I am not prepared to stay on this drug any longer.
Started on 15 mg and up to 30 mg week after. Past 2 weeks have been on 45 mg. I was told at higher doses it would be less sedating but this hasn't happened. The worst side effect is my overwhelming feelings of anger and rage. I've never been an aggressive person but this drug makes me lose my rag at the slightest irritation.
As for helping my depression it has done absolutely nothing. Very disappointing as a recent study in the Lancet suggested that Mirt along with Lustral and Escitalopram were all highly effective. I guess it's a case of different meds suit different people. I'm going to try and get switched to escitalopram (Cipralex) although due to its cost I'll probably get the runaround.
What annoys me is when the GP says 'You need to give it (the drug) time.' From everything I've read, the current thinking seems to be that if an antidepressant has NO effect whatsoever by 4 weeks then it will not have an effect in the future regardless of increasing the dose.
I've got a medical background so have been researching like crazy on this :roll: I think one of the key problems is that GPs see the bulk of depression and the bottom line is that they are not experts in mental health. My GP for example wasn't aware that Seroxat came in lower doses than 30 mg?! That is worrying...

"Hi all, I've been on Mirtazapine for nearly 3 months. Doctor increased my dose to 22.5 mg from 15mg but I started to get terrible heartburn and nausea, so we agreed to decrease back to 15mg, which I'm now on. The heartburn is still dreadful - I'm getting through half a pack of antacids a day. Of course, this might be nothing to do with Mirtazapine but whatever the cause, my throat and stomach are on fire much of the time. Any advice? Thanks!

"Hi!  I have been off and on Mirtazapine several times over the past 14 years.  I have also taken Gabapentin (off 2 years), Zoplicone (off 2 years), and Seroquel (off 11 months).  I have now been off the Mirtazapine for 4.5 months and the w/d symptoms have been horrific (chronic insomnia, burning, tingling, numbness, vibrations throughout body and head, adrenaline surges, depersonalization/derealisation, myoclonic jerks, burning brain, feeling like I'm either going 2 drop dead or go insane at any moment and the list goes on.  I have had a few windows the past couple of weeks, but it very soon goes back to being extremely debilitating, painful, terrifying and horrendous).  I am feeling extremely weak, exhausted and hopeless. 
Has anyone else suffered so horrendously getting off this poison and if so what did you do to manage your symptoms so they were at least tolerable?  As I am extremely paradoxical to almost all psych meds and a ton of other pharmaceuticals, going back on any drugs is out of the question.  I don't want to have to live through another w/d like this for as long as I live which may not be much longer if I soon don't start getting some regular sleep.  At best now I might get 2 hours per week.  Please answer as I am desperately in need of some advice and support as I am getting weaker by the day.  Thank you.

I don't want to hear anybody banging on about how this drug saved their life because I have read too many bad stories which outweigh and if the good - believe me, I have done enough research into how these drugs work and what they do.

"Hi all,
I was prescribed 7.5mg of Mirtazapine for my PPD and sleep issues. Ive been on it now for about 3.5 months, and for about 4 weeks now i have had pain and swelling in my ankles and knees but ESPECIALLY my fingers and forearms. The pain in my fingers both wakes and keeps me up at night.
I am scheduled to get x-rays and bloodwork for rheumatoid arthritis next week and I am also now on day 4 of just stopping the Mirtazapine cold turkey to see if it impacts the pain. My doctor said there is no weaning off 7.5mg as it's the lowest dose and will more likely just impact my sleep than mood. She is right so far.. difficulty falling asleep and some nighttime hot flashes, but all in all not bad!
Has anyone else experienced severe joint pain on this med? And did it clear up when you stopped? So hoping rheumatoid arthritis is not my new reality but tbd

"Hello,
I know there are a lot of posts about this already but I wanted to get an up to date view and advice please.
I have been on Mirtazepine 15mg for 1 year, 6 months. I got put on it after a messy divorce which left me depressed with extreme anxiety, and insomnia. It took a while but I got there and I am feeling so much better. I remember starting the meds though and I had the most horrendous brain fog for a few months and at times I still feel like my thoughts come out muddled if I am tired.
I generally feel ok now. Still anxious but always have been, but not depressed and sleeping fine. I want to come off the Mirtaz because of the brain fog and also because I have gained almost 30lbs in weight that I couldn't afford to gain. I am always hungry, I crave carbs and I have tried various diets but nothing seems to shift it and the hunger is so bad I always give in.
I have discussed this with my GP. He told me 3 months ago I had a choice between being overweight and being anxious and I had to choose one. I decided to stay on the Mirtaz. On his advice I had got down to every other night on the meds, but then the anxiety came back in full force. I get these surges, like a heat creeping up from my knees and up my body and crashing over my head, my heart pounds and I feel out of it for a couple of seconds. On the every other night, these surges were back in force so I chose to ignore the weight, try and deal with it through exercise and treat the anxiety,
Anyway, fast forward to today. I feel disgusting, I have never been this big in my life. I am happy enough in life now, good things are happening. So I am trying again to come off the Mirtaz. Again I spoke to my Dr. He could not have been less interested. His advice - 15mg every other day for 2 weeks and then just stop. If it doesn't work he'll give me another prescription. No answer to my questions about tapering, withdrawal side effects or other potential medications.
I feel completely alone and unsupported. Has anyone done 2 weeks every other day and stopped? What's in store for me? I am SO worried about insomnia again.
I have been every other day for 10 days again now. Yesterday the surges started again, I had broken sleep as the surges were happening through the night and waking me up. I took a Mirtaz last night.
I am starting a herbal supplement called Ashwaghanda - this is meant to help with anxiety and lowers cortisol. The Dr said the surges sound like cortisol surges, but he had no suggestion as to how to stop them.
Any advice on any of this will be really gratefully received. I am sorry for such a long post but I wanted to include as much as possible. Many thanks in advance.

"I've been on Mirtazapine for a year and a half, I had no real side effects when I started it and it's helped me enormously with my mental health.
When I pick up my prescription the tablets are quite often different brands; this hasn't been an issue before but when I started the tablets I was given as part of my latest prescription (which I'd noted wasn't a brand I remembered using before, though I can't be sure) I started to experience digestive discomfort, felt very gassy and needed to go to the toilet more frequently. I do have IBS so I do have little flare ups but this was different to my normal kind of flare up.
I couldn't get to speak with anyone at my GP surgery about swapping the tablets so took one of another brand I had leftover as a spare to see if it made any difference. Unfortunately I took some Immodium at the same time so taking a day off the new tablets wasn't really a very good indication of if it was those causing the problem, but I did have a couple of days of feeling better, thought I'd re start the new tablets to give them a chance and the unpleasant symptoms have returned. I was wondering if anyone else had had any experience of being affected differently by different brands of Mirtazapine? I know a GP is likely to say that they are all the same and it wouldn't make any difference, but I can tell there must be some variation across brands as the last ones I had had a very strong chemical taste, and these are tasteless. I begin to wonder now whether different brands might've had an impact on my otherwise unexplainable IBS flare ups at other times.
Might be entirely unrelated! But I'm kind of hoping it is the change of tablets as it'd offer an explanation.

"Hi all,
I've seen a lot of reviews online about this drug and thought I'd add my own two pennies' worth as the other reviews were tremendously helpful when I was researching the side effects of Mirt.
So first of all - My conditions:
Click here to view image
2. I have the usual constant flurry of mental 'traffic' associated with anxiety: endless to-do lists of things I need to do around the house or at work or in my personal life,  over-analysing every conversation I've ever had in my entire life over and over again, finding my jaw clenched from gritting my teeth from the frustration of it all and the inability to get anything done because I am constantly distracted by things which have happened (or might still happen!).
3. I also have a form of insomnia which means that although I do fall asleep very quickly, I struggle to maintain the healthy deep sleep which you need for emotional replenishment. Nightmares are the norm as is waking up randomly at 3am or 4am and not being able to sleep again. Get up in the mornings feeling more tired than when you went to sleep. This didn't help the feelings of agitation and aggression at all.
4. On a side note, I also got migraines sometimes caused by eating rich foods or drinking or high levels of stress, but also from an old motorbike injury where I sustained some deep tissue damage to my left shoulder. The muscles along there and the neck tense up when I am stressed, which was always because I wasn't sleeping and I felt like an awful human being.
Starting the Mirtazapine:
I started on the 15mg Mirtazapine. I took it the Friday evening and was completely emotionally detached for the whole weekend thereafter. I was distant and felt fuzzy, but strangely happy at the same time. I remember thinking that everyone should be taking this stuff because there would be a lot less fighting in the world. 
By Monday I started 'feeling' again, and with that snap back to reality, I had quite an unwelcome passenger - a new ravenous appetite which I have never experienced before. As a healthy and active size 12, I was no stranger to my appetite but this was just a new level of crazy hungry. Well, not even hungry really, just greedy. I started pulling boxes of biscuits and cereal and oats which had been sitting in the cupboard for months, and devoured a lot in one sitting, a lot of times.  I remember feeling quite healthy in a way because an appetite meant I had a lust for life, right? 
If only the hunger wasn't paired with severe feelings of suicide and self-harm! Luckily I was able to rationalise these feelings as the side-effects as the medication and within a few days the feelings subsided.
The sleepiness started a few days after the appetite and initially I just put this down to bad eating but after a while I could not ignore it. People use the word 'drowsy' to describe how sleepy you get but that doesn't cut it. I was finding it almost impossible to wake up in the mornings, even after a shower and a brisk walk in the cold to get the circulation going. It took a good 2-3 hours before I could have an understandable conversation with anyone (through mouthfuls of snacks of course!). 
During my new sleeping pattern of sleeping for 11-12 hours solid (missing alarm clocks, my partner getting ready for the work, the dogs barking to be let out) I had some pretty vivid and intense dreams. No nightmares though so that suited me fine as the alternative was much more unpleasant.
1 month later…
So here we are, a month on, and I’ve noticed a few other changes. My energy levels are a bit like a steam train - difficult and slow to get going, but once I'm awake, I don't need to nap like I used to do most days, and my energy actually feels pretty level from waking up to going to sleep. So that's a massive plus for somenoe like me who's energy fluctuates with my emotions and moods.
I did get a fair bit of dry mouth from the meds but I just made sure I always had a bottle of water with me at all times and it just helped with keeping me hydrated so that's not a bad point as such.
Because I am sleeping well and feeling better, my shoulder isn't tensing up as much so I'm not getting migraines, which is great. 
Interestingly enough, because I am no longer living in my own negative emotions all the time, I am better able to identify the people around me who have actually had a negative effect on me all my life through projecting their own issues on to me. I've actively been avoiding these people and the further away I get from them, the more I see how bad their presence in my life was. (Be aware that this realisation may make you come across as 'cold' or 'distant' to the energy vampires who have been feeding off you for years. Don't be afraid to let go of these people - you don't need them!)
So, to summarise:
Pro's:
Better energy levels once awake
Better quality of sleep
Muscles more relaxed as not as stressed out
Not as agitated or aggressive towards people around me
Click here to view image
Better able to deal with issues as don't feel completely overwhelmed
Courage to break ties with energy leeches
Con's:
Waking up in the mornings is like trying to play water polo in a swimming pool filled with treacle
Both Pro and Con (depending on how you look at it):
Slight emotional distance - probably not noticeable to those who aren't close to you (and those close to you know that this is still better than having an unhappy, raging hell-demon as their friend / partner / colleague!). For me this has had the unexpected side-effect of becoming more logical in my approach to problem-solving, which, as a highly sensitive person, has been a welcome break from alway having to base my arguments or thoughts on feelings (which were often irrational and a knee-jerk response to a situation which I later regretted).  
All in all, I feel better than I have done in years. I think I have covered most of the points and hope that some of it is useful to anyone out there considering starting on this anti-depressant. Feel free to post a reply in this discussion and if you have any questions I can help with, I will happily answer.

"This is a follow up thread to 'Coming off mirtazapine', for people to share their experiences and tips, and give support to one another.
Mirtazapine is a very powerful drug and an exceptional antidepressant which works much more quickly than others, sometimes within days. It has many very good attributes, but also has some bad side effects such as weight gain for some, which means there are many people trying to withdraw from it.
What most doctors don't tell you, is that it is not an easy drug to come off. You will usually be advised to halve your dose for two weeks and then come off it. Sometimes, people are told to just stop it and start another AD with disasterous results. This thread is for those people who have successfully withdrawn from mirtazapine to tell others how they did it, or for those currently part way through the journey, or for those who are facing the withdrawal process and are daunted by the thought of it.

"I have suffered from mild to moderate anxiety and indigestion for almost 4 years causing me palpitations, migraines, acid reflux, lack of sleep and some other symptoms. I finally caved into my wife and family's advice to start some treatment. My GP prescribed Lansoprazole for the acid reflux and Mirtazapine for the anxiety and lack of sleep.
I extremely reluctantly started on 15mg of Mirtazapine once before bed but for the first 7-10 days i got really bad side effects like extreme weakness, fatigue, shaking hands and arms, muscles aching, drowsiness all day ect etc. So, on my doctors advice i decreased the dose to 7.5mg and thankfully most of the side effects have improved a lot. However, i still have slight shaky hands/arms as well as weak muscles. Also, my doctor said he wants me to take this for minimum 3 months and maybe even upto 1 year. I found that crazy because this was never meant to be a long term thing so now i am really angry with myself for starting this on the advice of my wife and family and doctor.
Should i be worried about taking this for that long and also coming off this and the effects of withdrawal?
Any advice is much appreciated.

For example; I cannot make a fist or grip even a pillow in the morning, I have to use two hands to lift a full kettle, and I hobble around for about 30 minutes in the morning before my feet loosen up.  The weakness lasts all day long but the stiffness subsides. I was wondering if anyone else on Mirtazapine has these symptoms?  
It may be unrelated, and otherwise Mirtazapine has been a god send!

"I would really like to hear others experience of different doses for anxiety.
About 7 weeks ago i started having a few panic attacks and 24/7 anxiety. I stopped sleeping for a few nights and was prescribed Xanax, which helped but made me nervous from an addiction perspective. a week or so later, a Psychiatrist put me on Citalopram and initially it made my anxiety worse. I understand that it is a side effect in the early days, but my Insomnia was so bad and driving me crazy, that i needed something to help me sleep. So after 6 days on Citalopram, I was asked to switch to Mirtazapine 15mg. The first night was great, i slept for 10 hours and though i had some side effects (nightmares, sweating, jelly legs) in the first week, these settled down and i started to feel good. it really felt that the anxiety has gone away. I did also start some counselling and eating healthy, exercise, supplements etc. as well.
After 3 weeks of progress (I started meeting with friends and thinking about returning to work), my doc suggested increasing to 22.5mg because 'it was unlikely that 15mg would be a long term effective dose to help me recover fully'. A few days into the 22.5mg dose and i noticed that i was starting to feel a bit light headed. After 6 days, i had a mini panic attack and the anxiety returned. My doc suggested i increase to 30mg, which i did and held it for 9 days at that dosage. But i didnt feel any better. I felt more on edge and my sleep was more broken - waking up 3/4 times in the night and awake early every day. Mood low especially in the morning, back pain getting worse, jelly legs all morning/afternoon and after taking the pill in the evening.
Having read alot of info about Mirt, including this forum, i told my doc that i thought 30mg and even 22.5mg are too activating for me. I think that my issue is anxiety and not so much depression and i have read that higher doses can increase anxiety. She did agree to try this, though she said that we may need to introduce an SSRI to complement the Mirt 15mg.
I am now tapering back down to 15mg. My doc suggested 4 days at 22.5mg and then 15mg. I am on day 4 and so i should move back to 15mg today. The jelly legs and nervousness had improved a little at 22.5mg so far.
I would be really interested to hear other peoples experiences of taking 15mg vs higher doses for anxiety. Also any views on my situation. Thanks.

"Hi
I've been taking mirtazapine for a little over a week now and I am sleeping much better except that I have awful dreams. I used to take citalopram and had some weird dreams when I was taking them but it seems to be much worse since I changed to mirtazapine.
I wake up feeling terrible because the dreams have been so weird or frightening and it takes me a while to settle down again.
It's such a shame because before I started taking them I had difficulty sleeping, now that has improved but I'm nervous about falling asleep incase I have another horrible dream.
Does anyone else get horrible dreams while taking mirtazapine?

"I started with mirtazapine of 7.5mg on August 18th. I was taking that dose for 4 days then went up to 15mg for about 2 weeks. Then up to 30mg for about 3 weeks. So, I've been on it for something longer than 5 weeks overall.
I don't believe it has done anything to help except for changing my metabolism and inducing hair loss and scalp pimples and zits; therefore, I decided to taper off 2 days ago.
Since I haven't been taking it for a long time, what is the best approach toward tapering off safely?
Could I take 15mg for about 7 days, then 7.5mg for another 7, then 3.75mg for another 7?
Or should I immediately lower to 7.5mg tonight?
Anyone experienced with this drug, could you, please, give me an advice?
Thank you for reading.

"Hello, I need help to understand how this antidepressant work for anxiety. I am suffering from severe anxiety (suspected hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome - hyper pots) which causes my heart rate to increase by 30-50 beats per minute upon standing along with blood pressure increase, and so it's hard for even to even stand because of heart palpitations, fatigue, dizziness etc, and so i lay in my bed for 22-23 hours daily for 8 months, my muscles are GONE, i am only existing. Medicine history story in few sentences: after more than several heart tests year ago, they found nothing except mentioned sinus tachycardia episodes and high blood pressure when anxious, for example it was 170/90 with the heart rate of 120 just sittting and talking to cardiologist cuz of anxiety and body many posture changes, but it's in 40s when i sleep and it varies from 50s to 140s every hour during the day, which cardiologists think relates to anxiety. I decided to go to psychiatrist and so she saw severe anxiety and gave me ssri antidepressant escitalopram which made me a lot worse, my heart rate was 90-100 even when i wanted to go to sleep. Now she wants to put me on mirtazapine and i just can't understand how it can work because its serotonin and norepinephrine reuptaker, so how it will reduce my anxiety if i will have more norepinephrine in my blood, i thought they will block it, not increase it. This is a paradox that i fail to understand, what kind of treatment is that? I am scared that this will increase my anxiety/panic attacks/heart rate/blood pressure just like escitalopram. What were your experiences with it? Thank you!

"Hey everyone,
I've been on Mirtazapine 30mg since Feb his year but I've had alot of problems with. Ear infections, burning mouth syndrome etc. so my Psychiatrist think's I should come of it. He told me to cut down to 15mg and only take them for a week and then just stop. So I finally stopped taking the 15mg on Mon night and I feel terrible.
It's not just my moods (my depression/anxiety had been great before coming off med), I physically feel really sick, been feeling extremely nauseated and last night couldn't sleep because I kept thinking I was going to throw up. Is this a normal reaction coming off mirtazapine?
Because my depression/anxiety had gotten alot better, we didn't feel the need to just take me off mirtazapine and put on on another drug because I thought I was cured. Plus, I don't want to take any more antidepressants at all really.

"I posted on another thread but thought might be useful to start another discussion -apologies for repeating myself...
Decided to withdraw from Mirt - 7days ago - having been in them for around 8 months -  dropped from 30-15mg straight away Doctors idea - tried to taper - just got frustrated and impatient-so came off them all together .
Over 8 months I’d gone from 13st11 to a whopping 16st -I tried eating healthily exercising nothing changed - insatiable appetite - constantly grazing in the fridge - cramming food - not like me at all- weight just climbed
I’ve been off Mirt now for6 days - of course I’m not expecting to get away with out side effects from cold turkey withdrawal -BUT I have to report I’ve had none so far - I feel fresher than I’ve felt in years - I don’t dread the day anymore which is so strange the fog has almost gone .
The vivid dreams have gone  too - were amazing initially but as the months wore on - became exhausting -but now coming off them -I’m still sleeping well and I’m so thankful for that .
Importantly - as this was itself adding to the downward spiral and fog - I’ve dropped 7lbs in weight.
I started taking Magnesium  and vitamin B the day I stopped -  1 per day -
advice from others on this forum and the health shop
Im only giving my experience here we are all different  I know others have had a terrible time withdrawing- but I just wanted to share a positive story - good luck to anyone thinking of or going through the same process I’m here if anyone wants to talk or pm me . 
Maybe the Mirtdid it’s job - I still don’t know -maybe I’ll never know - i do know my character and life changed for the worse - it affected my family too - as a result of going on them and I’ll personally never use the drug again . Looking forward now again for the first time in years x

"Hello all, I have been through a very rough time over the past two years. Firstly I lost my job, then went through a breakup, then I moved back home from overseas and I went through months of months of lockdown in isolation. I have no real friends where I am so I feel like i need to rebuild my life from scratch. I was put on 30MG of Mirtazapine four weeks ago by a psychiatrist after spending two weeks on 15MG. It has been very rough so far. Sleep is better and weirdly a few days ago I felt better for around 2-3 days but now it feels like I am back to square one and feeling terrible again!! Is these types of ups and downs normal? I have seen three psychologists and none have really helped, it feels like I am on a rollercoaster with this medication. I am wondering how much more time I should give this before I go back to my doctor/psychiatrist.

"Been on Mirtazapine for approx 4 months, currently 22.5mg. Also taking 40mg Seroxat. What's the best way to come off Mirtazapine? The side effects outweigh the benefits. The medical profession have just left me in limbo. They were quick to put me on to the Mirtazapine but have offered no help in coming off. The waiting list to see a physchiatrist is months. The duty doctor just told me to go from 30mg to 15mg & then come straight off them. My own doctor said that there's not much she can do other than help me with the insomnia by prescribing me a week's supply of 7.5mg Zopiclone but no more after because they're addictive. So i feel that i am well & truly in complete limbo at the moment. Due to the insomnia, they advised me to go back on 30mg but the side effects were too harsh. They then advised me to drop to 22.5mg but still the insomnia continues & side effects are harsh. I've been sleeping 4 hours per night roughly for the last 2 weeks, which is having a detrimental impact on my mental & physical health. I feel the sooner i can safely get off the awful drug the better. The longer i take it the worse the withdrawals will be. I do realise that some withdrawals are inevitable but i obviously would like to limit the severity & duration. Any help would be appreciated.

I have had 2 bouts of depression anxiety previously to this current bout.
previously taken venlafaxine and citalopram. was lastly on citalopram 15mg about 2 years ago and stopped after about 10 months after feeling better, but obviously too soon. it took about 3 months to settle on citalopram, nauseous digestive and anxiety.
i have been on mirtazapine for about 10 months starting at 15 and increasing to 37.5 mg. the last increase from 30mg to 37.5mg 3 weeks ago.
it has helped but my mood is still low and and anxious during the day and fixating on stuff. i am sleeping ok but am tired, lethargic and anxious during the day.
Dr is suggesting that we could add
citalopram to the mirtazapine. at 10mg, maybe reducing mirtazapine and maybe increasing cit and decreasing mirt further.

"Hey,
I wanted to check to see if anyone else is running into these same withdrawal symptoms. I had taken my last dose of Mirtazapine a little over three weeks ago. For two weeks prior to that I had cut down the prescription to 3.75. I had cut down the dose of Mirtazapine in half from 30 mg every two weeks. I had not experienced a great deal of withdrawal symptoms until I removed Mirtazapine completely three weeks ago. Since then I can fall asleep at night, but I can only sleep in two-three hour increments. When I wake up I have an extremely hard time falling back asleep, and I'm lucky to get another 2 hours the entire night. I have been fully unable to sleep through the night. My appetite is almost none existent.
I have tried taking melatonin or over the counter natural sleep aids to help me sleep, and they haven't helped at all. Does this sound like anything that any of you had experienced with the withdrawal? My doctor frequently tells me that the Mirtazapine should be out of my system, but I had been on the medication for 2 years. I can't imagine it hasn't altered my brain's chemical make-up in some way.
Really, I just want to hear that I'm not alone in this. Part of me feels I should give in and go back on this medication to restore some normalcy, but I wanted to get some other's perspectives! I do see that others had some insomnia, but I wanted to see if how I described it sounds similar to your experiences.
Thank you!

"My life is crumbling down more than it was before. yes, i'm starting this like that because im desperate. I've been living 9 years with ocd ( more than one theme of ocd) plus anxiety disorder, depression, phobias, manias and other stuffs. I also have health anxiety and i'm paranoid. But the most thing that affects me is the ocd, super hard. I started antidepressant when i finally decided to visit for the second time a psychologist ( my worst mistake ever) i can't remember which meds i took before, but i do remember that i got off them because they literally broke my stomach and where not helping at all. I , since i was a little girl i suffered from gastritis, and the first meds were making that condition worst, so i got off them and put on Mirtazapine 15 mg and vistaril 25 mg. I can say that in my first week on Mirt i felt like i didn't felt for 9 years( My ocd was quiet, i didn't have any intrusive thoughts or anything else that the ocd made me feel) then the rest of the days, i kept feeling better, until i found multiple articles saying that antidepressants taken in long term ( taken for many years) was really bad for health, that the reason of some peoples sudden deaths( when they apparently were healthy and okay) was because of taking antidepressants, which caused multiple health issues( some at high risk of having them) So of course, from someone who loves her life i quickly decided to get out of it ( thinking mainly about my health, so i dont get more problems , health problems, than what i already have) i remember i cut the pill in half, and took 7.5 mg, but it destroyed me, making me feel instantly sick, was horrible ( i didn't know back then about withdrawals and that this med cause dependence and that coming off was such a journey and a pain in the ass and also, very dangerous) so i went and cut it in half but the next day i had to go back at taking the full 15 mg pill. To make this short, is been almost 2 years of tapering this med ( after many errors and mistakes) i finally found a "" better way"" to taper this med off ( which is the liquid solution) i found about that when i was at 10 mg so since then i've been tapering like that although way to fast( my othe rmistake) but i finally, like i said, found the "" right way"" of tapering this med, which is my 1 mg every 46 days. Now, after all i've gone through with the tapering ( a horror) now i'm starting to think what i should've had thought since the beginning, but i was sooo stressed and soo many thing were happening, choices that i needed to make( hard ones) overall i was going though hell, so i didnt think about what i'm thinking now. Ocd is a disorder that doesn't have a cure( said from the people who apparently know) yes, some people have gotten cure and never again have to experience the horror that ocd causes ( something that not many are aware of) but is a few, and its still something that got me shock and still can't understand how but good for them, they got the miracle. But i sadly am not one of those persons, i've been suffering really bad because of my ocd and instead of getting better ( like i hope everyday that i would) i dont, and i'm getting worst. I can say that my ocd is now worst than before starting antidepressants. Don't know if it is because i'm tapering( coming off this med) and that makes my problems worse than what they were already?? but one thing i know is that, once i come off this med for good ( completely) what then?.. i which i could still think that once im off i'm gonna be cure of everything and the pill will go down along with all my mental problems, but i know that's to good to be truth. The small saint part of my brain tells me that everything will go back to be the way it was before or worse, and i ask myself now...i'm going through all of this horror, suffering even more because of the tapering and all for what?? to eventually have to get back on meds because my ocd is bad again?? that's why i started this with my life is crumbling down ( more than it has this 9 years of suffer) i've got many relapses with my ocd ( 3 days without eating from how depressed those intrusive none stop thoughts made me feel, and the other repalses have been equally bad or worse) now i'm sensing another relapse and i think is a bad one, so what am i supposed to do?? i trying soo hard but everything keeps falling out of place and getting more messier. I'm not only dealing with my mental problems, but with the tapering as well and its difficulties which are a lot. what am i suppose to do?? this is just incredible... is like you try and try and keep trying but no succeed. I'm p****d off!

"first off I never wanted to stay on Mirtz, i had extreme heart palpitations, yet my drs said this was perfectly normal and gave me proprananol, i trusted them, big mistake because they never went, plus I put on 2 stone because i became a sugar addict, i would squirt caramel sauce straight into my mouth which is not a behaviour I have.
(just in case someone reads this whom is on or needing to start mirtz, please know my mum is on 30mg and it did wonders for her, minus the weight gain).
I have been telling my GP for years I am not depressed, that something else is wrong, yet even with the knowledge and experience I have, I was told i was because of a form i filled in.
In April of this year I went for a routine blood test to check for infection, but when I sat in the chair I told the nurse I was there to have my thyroid checked, and luckily I did because I was in thyroid failure and the drs said it had probably taken years to get this bad. My thyroid is in range now and im feeling motivated, happy and in less pain. I am also B12 deficient and getting injections for this. So, thats the part of my spirit that was trying to tell me I wasnt depressed, that something was seriously wrong with me, I wish Id known years ago I could have Paid £75 for private blood tests.
After I knew I had underactive thyroid I wanted off Mirtz, I went from 15mg to 7.5mg to 3.75 in May within two weeks, and the pain I suffered was nothing I had experienced before, my muscles kept going into a spasm, excruitiating pain and it ruined my holiday because I couldn't walk properly, you can imagine just how frightened I was because I wondered if i was dying, I felt that bad (and ive done lyrica and tramadol withdrawal in the past). That weekend we had the ambulance out because oh heart pains, the ambulance said they've seen this before with people coming off Mirtz, they told me I have to get medicine and slowly taper to avoid these issues, so Monday morning I rang the drs and they reluctantley gave me the medicine, the dr told me to go back to 7,5 mg and reduce it every two weeks by 0.5 ml, it was going to take forever to get off this, I did'nt want it to take this long, but I listened and did exactly as I was told (mostly).
I noticed immediately that I withdrawal symptoms did not start until day 3/4, they peeked at days 8-10 then subsided. I did this until I got down to 2ml, then after two weeks dropped to 1, then 10 days later nothing, this process took 3 months i believe.
I am doing ok at the moment, I am on day 5 and my body is hurting, my muscles are aching and I am sleeping a little bit worse.
My tips:
Buy Magnesium flakes (MUST be flakes) mix one cup or Magnesium with one cup of filtered water and heat until dissolved, take off heat and wait for it to cool then pour into a spray bottle, now you have your very own muscle pain treatment, just spray whenever you need to. You can also buy magnesium oil spray from Amazon.
Take a Magnesium supplement, it will help with muscle spasms, take it at night to hell with sleep.
valerian oil mixed with olive oil and rubbed on the feet may help with sleep issues. I just bought sleep remedies from my local traditional chinese medicine dr, which is a miracle even though it tastes awful!
I get accupuncture which helps with pain and irritability, although this is for my chronic pain and sciatica, it has helped me get through this taper.
Drop your dose three days before you know its the weekend, so others may be around to help.
epsom salt baths, 500mg thrown in the bath at a time with a 20minute soak.
Rest, walk, rest, walk etc.
be kind to yourself, you didnt know this was going to happen to you, I sure as hell didnt, Never have I experienced anything like this, and I know some people dont suffer, which I'm so happy for them, but this post is for those who suffer like I have,
Theres so much more I can share, but I will wait if anyone has any questions and ill be here and check every morning and night, I had no support and hope I can assist others get through this, because we can, we will and we will thrive.
best of luck to you on your journey x

"I have suffered from anxiety and depression and anxiety for three years now, my sertraline was upped from 30 mg per day to now 200 mg i was put on matazapine excuse spelling and i have taken myself off it, normally a gentle giant but now I'm angry like really angry.
There are people that say ""not sure why I'm always fighting"" but that mainly due to them looking for it, now I feel I am this way I see things i didn't see before like people who perhaps have angry faces, I assume its towards me, my poor wife has said I'm a different person.
I am an angry man and its like I want to let that rage out on people, I thought i was alone but after Google I feel better and confident I made the right choice to stop it.
there needs to be more studies done to sort this out ad increasing the dose made it worse, my normal really good energy had gone and this man on an angry mission who was always tired took over.
not me at all! hope this helps anyone else, I was actually pushing my wife away and picking fights with her over nothing, convinced myself she was cheating on me, save yourself and marriage (if you have one) and don't take this med.

"I am posting this to help/encourage anybody considering coming off Mirtazapine.
Having had my original dosage increased from 7.5 mg to 45mg by a physchiatrist without explaining the terrible side effects (weight gain, reduced metabolic rate, lethargy & tiredness to name just a few), I am taking back control by tapering it by 25% per month.
Only on day 3 but no side effects so far, albeit I will welcome them as it shows my body is adjusting.
Will post on a monthly basis with updates.

"I thought I would start a thread about trying to lose weight on this drug. If others are currently dieting, please add your experiences here. I would like to discover whether we gain weight on mirtazapine purely because it increases our appetite, or whether other factors are at play. I certainly gained weight quickly when I started on mirtazapine (around 1.5 stone). My appetite was revenous, especially for sugary foods. I tried to com off mirtazapine around 6 months in and failed. I lost half a stone in the week I waas off it, but most of that was due to severe nausea. When I went back on the drug I did not gain more than a couple of pounds, but I was being very careful what I ate. My weight has been steady now for two years.
I am not happy carrying around the extra stone however, and so have decided to diet. I am on day 8 and it is VERY hard. But I have lost two pounds so far. This is with me still eating 1700 - 1800 calories a day. I have a very active physical job and so my daily calorie requirement is 2100.
I have also started taking raspberry ketones and green coffee bean extract as of this morning in the hope that it will help me to burn fat. The interesting thing is, the amouont of weight I have lost is the same as would be expected from a person who is not on mirtazapine.

"I started it about 10 days ago and was on my previous medication for a few of those days and cross tapered off it.
I felt dizzy and faint, sometimes slow and confused and felt overly angry.
I went out drinking (even though I knew I definitely wasn't feeling well enough for this) and after something bad happened that night + not feeling well at all I went home.
I now feel awful, really bad mentally, so many bad thoughts.
Has anyone had any similar experiences? Or does anyone think this isn't the medication and instead just the bad experience?

"Hi Guys,
I've been on Mirtazapine for 3 weeks (2 weeks at 15mg, 1 week at 30mg). I've decided to come off them as they are making me feel terribly fatigued and giving me jumpy legs when in bed at night. I was planning on cutting back down to 15mg for one week, and then perhaps another week at 7.5mg and then just stopping. Do you think that would be the best plan of action to minimise any withdrawal symptoms? Or should I look at coming off them more quickly? 
Also I was wondering if i'm still likely to experience increased sedative effects at the lower doses even after being on a higher dose?
 Any advice much appreciated!

"On June 15th (2021) I took my last dose of Remeron for insomnia and anxiety. I had been on it since 2003. I started the taper very slowly---2020 I went from 30mg to 15mg. But, I'll admit, I sped up the taper significantly this year, which I regret. I'm not sure how to un-ring that bell now.
I don't feel great. I don't feel horrible all of the time, either. I sleep 3-5 hours each night. Some anxiety is back. Waves of panic followed by waves of feeling really good--alert, clear headed. The bad waves tend to feel like they're gong to last forever, but it's important to note that they haven't (yet). The good waves make me feel like I've finally made it to the ""top of the withdrawal mountain"" but it's important to note that I haven't (yet).
Is anyone else feeling intense waves from Remeron withdrawal? I'm curious if anyone has any input on the length of these withdrawal symptoms. I'm also curious if these symptoms are even withdrawal symptoms. Perhaps it's just my original anxiety symptoms reminding me that they never really left, but were just resting while I took Remeron.
At this point I am uncertain if Remeron is the killer or the life saver. It kind of depends on the flavor and strength of a particular wave. Do I just not want to admit to myself that I actually need to take Remeron? I've read a few blogs here and I see that a lot of people are pretty miserable in the midst of Remeron withdrawal. But, weren't you feeling pretty miserable to go on it in the first place? I was. How are we so certain that these are withdrawal symptoms of Remeron rather than the return of the original issues that led us to go on it in the first place? Anyway, these are questions I ask myself. Often.

"Been prescribed Mirtazapine for sleep and anxiety/depression. Was on Trazodone on/off for around 2 months for sleep before that (I did not have depression before starting Trazodone. I was actually quite happy with my life. I never had any issue with sleep until January either. But then I was prescribed CPAP for severe sleep apnea. Sleep anxiety developed while trying to adapt to CPAP). My depressive feelings started after trying to quit Trazodone within just 3 weeks. Now I want to quit Mirtazapine. I was on 7.5mg (May 14-May 28) and then on 15mg. Would like to know what is the best way to quit. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist on July 16. But I want to start reducing the dose as soon as possible. My sleep now is completely dependent on the drug. I sleep ~6 hours on average per night now (with Trazodone it was 3-5 hours) and I can not take nap any time else even if I am extremely sick. I had no problem napping until January this year. I would love to be able to sleep without any drug.

The tingling sensations and headaches have started, lack of appetite upset stomach dull feeling sometimes quite irritable, so many different withdrawal symptoms but I am menopausal too and began the medication I felt as a result of early menopause not being diagnosed so it's a big ball of fun.
I am determined to eliminate this drug from my life. My main incentive and positive is the weight loss it is finally happening AND THE WEIGHT GAIN WAS CONSTANT BEFORE!!!
So this makes me hopeful that with the reduction in weight I will start to feel better.

"I have been on mirt for the last 4 years. I have only been on 45mg for 8 months, prior to that I was on 30mg. I went ahead and did as was told, its been 5 days since I have been on 30mg... I haven't noticed anything so far but I am dubious of this steep drop, doesn't sound right reading how others reduce by far less and other websites advising to taper by 10% . I would just like to know, how long does it take to experience any kind of withdrawals? I would rather stay on 30mg if this is a standard way to taper so just looking for experience of others if this can be done as advised?
I am also on quetiapine 150mg as well so will this help mitigate any potential withdrawal from mirt?

"When I hit menopause I also hit insomnia in quite a big way. I started amitriptyline 10mg and that seemed to help to a certain extent. However, I started getting a condition called cervical dystonia, which can be caused by ami, so I was advised to go onto mirtazapine 15mg instead. I took that for 5 weeks but my sleep was not good, so I asked to go back to ami and the GP switched my prescription back.
My sleep has just crashed since switching, and having read around, I realise that I could be suffering from mirtazapine withdrawal as there was no tapering. I have had a look at the 10% tapering withdrawal method and that looks like a good way to go. However, my question is, how do I toggle that with the ami? Should I start the ami with 10% of the prescribed dose and build it up as I reduce the mirt?

"Hi everyone,
I need your experiences with switching from Mirt to another Antidepressant/Antipsychotic please.
I have been taking Mirtazapine 15 mg at night for 4 weeks. Because of the weight gain issue I have asked for a replacement and after seeing a specialist yesterday I will be starting Vortioxetine (Trintellix) this week.
The two medications are very similar in chemical structure, medical effect etc. and I am wondering if I have to wean off Mirtazapine or if I can just switch from one to the other.
According to the product description the withdrawal symptoms of Trintellix seem to be the same as those of Mirtazapine:
""Stopping this medication suddenly may lead to side effects such as dizziness, abnormal dreams, numbness or tingling sensations, agitation, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, sweating, or other symptoms.""
That's why I am thinking that a switch should have no major side effects since both drugs are of the same ""family"".
Vortioxetine (Trintellix) is a fairly new drug that has just been approved last year here in Canada for distribution, so I don't expect anyone to have experience with exactly this combination, but maybe you have been switched to Lithium or some other AD/AP.

"Background/ I've been on mirtazapine for 12 years and made multiple attempts to come off it. The longest i've managed was 6 months after being on 45mg for 7 years. Originally I was prescribed it for depression and insomnia, but my diagnosis is now complex ptsd.
In the last 2 years the largest dose i've taken regularly is 7.5mg and i stopped taking it all together 3 nights ago. I've managed 2/3 hours sleep each night so far and gone from 11 stone to 10 stone 4 in that time.
Side effects so far are lack of sleep, nausea, no appetite, mild anxiety, feeling hot, constantly sweating, dehydration and forgetting what i am saying mid sentence.
I'm determined that this attempt will be my last and i hope to be able to write something positive in this thread eventually.

"Hi, I'm 21, and I started taking 7.5mg of Mirtazapine sometime after the 18th of May in 2021. It's now June 16th 2021, and I'm wanting to stop the medication. I weigh around 80 lbs, so the medication affects me a lot more than other people. The drowsiness effect lasts anywhere between 12 hrs and 14 hours after I've taken it, and it's not doing me any favours on anxiety, depression, or appetite.
I've read that even at a dosage as low as this, withdrawal symptoms are hellish, but most of these reports are from long term users, where I've been taking it for less than a month at the time of writing this. My PCP, the one who prescribed the medication, said that at this low of a dose I could just go cold turkey and be fine, but I'm hesitant to trust this information based on the stories I've read on here.
How quickly can I taper off? I've seen a 10% decrease per month, but I don't want to keep taking this for that long with how many hours of my day it's sucking up. Would a 50% decrease per week be okay? And since the 7.5mg is already half a pill, how would I keep slicing it when the pills are already pretty small?
If it helps, I have some other medications I'm taking listed down here as well, as this may affect some of this. I've been taking both of these for years, Mirtazapine is the only new one.
Adderall XR 10mg for ADHD
Trazodone 75mg for sleep
EDIT: Update 6/18/21
I decided to start tapering at 50% per week. The first day was a lot of crying and anxiety, but no physical ailments. It's been a couple days, and I'm mostly experiencing depression, a lack of motivation, tiredness, and, surprisingly, an increased appetite. Not sure whether these are withdrawal symptoms or merely the effects of the medication. The lingering drowsy feeling i had for about 4 hours after my normal wake time on the 7.5mg dose has decreased significantly.
I'm still seeking help though. I really want to be rid of this medication as soon as possible, and I'm debating going down to 50% per every three days instead of per week. Would this be safe to do, or should I continue with the 50% per week? and once I get down to 1.625mg, would i be able to quit completely after the week timeline, or should i go down to 0.8125mg and THEN quit completely?
EDIT: Update 6/22/21
Decided to stop completely on the 19th, felt wonderful that first day. Felt a little lousy the second day, but after that I have no withdrawal symptoms.

"If anyone could share some of their experiences and perhaps advise on when this nightmare is going to end I'd really appreciate it. 
I’m 34, otherwise healthy, started Mirtazapine (in some sense against my instincts) about two years ago due to severe anxiety (no depression at all) and panic attacks. My Doctor prescribed Mirtazapine 30mg, to be tapered upwards from 7.5mg. 
I remember the first few days I felt a weird sensation when swallowing (simply felt like uncoordinated swallowing, where the food/drink seemed to be going at the wrong velocity towards its target). However, after a while and increasing dosage this symptom vanished more or less. 
Fast forward about a year and a half forward, and (apart from helping my IBS by making me numb) - the drug was totally useless anxiety-wise. I was still feeling very bad. True, I had not gotten many panic attacks, but I found that they were just transposed with a very generalized anxiety which I believe (self-diagnosed) had almost become a phobia: I became afraid of trying new things altogether from fear of having e.g., an allergic reaction (never had any of those ever in my life and never feared them before either). I had quit sports because I could not stand the sensations involving an increase in heart rate or blood flow. Done all of the tests and all is fine with my heart and everything else for that matter. It’s all in the head but the head controls your body and your mind.
 The Mirtazapine just made me numb; I could feel less love to my fiancée (now wife!) and cared less about the world in general. Realizing that I had just become more anxious (if less panicky) the Doc upped the dosage to 45mg. What a disaster. More than a month afterwards I was just getting more and more anxious on a daily basis.
 Eventually, AMA, I decided that going on Mirtazapine was the biggest mistake of my life. I started tapering, very VERY slowly. I think I went from 45 to 15mg with relative ease, taking more than two weeks at a time to decrease the dosage by 3-4mg at a time. Each time, I would feel great for 2 days, then start developing quite severe cramps and feel lousy for another week or so, then I’d get slightly better. Knowing that I am really ultrasensitive to any change in physiological parameters I tapered from 15mg to 3.75mg in a turtle’s pace: 3.75mg at a time, with more than a month (and even two sometimes) between each taper. I have a PhD in Chemistry so I know what I’m doing. Again, every time, after 2-3 victorious days where I’d feel like I’ve conquered mount Everest, I’d then feel lousy for 4-8 days; but then things would seem to be a bit better. Weirdly, at the lower doses of 7.5mg and 3.75mg I started again experiencing swallowing difficulties; I started choking on water and became very mindful of my swallowing dyscoordination. Still I felt altogether quite alright – and I believed that the remainder would be similar.
 How wrong was I. I have come off it completely exactly two weeks ago. Again 2-3 days where I felt fine, then a few more days with cramps. Then, good old panic hit, with terrible anxiety that just keeps getting worse and worse. I feel terrible weakness, zero energy, I have withered due to loss of appetite (since when I eat my stomach just cramps a few hours later; actually not so bad since I had put on some weight during my time on Mirtazapine). I feel completely overwhelmed by the symptoms: every time there is something new. I feel weird tingling sensations and I have strange feelings of pressure in my stomach. I get dizzy a lot and then just feel weak. My muscles are sore without any reason. I was certain that these issues would resolve in a few days; Mirtazapine’s half-life is quite long and I know that receptors can take 2-3 weeks to get re-modulated (actually that’s why they always say that the beneficial effects of Mirtazapine will take around 2-3 weeks to become effective when you go on it). But I did not expect this gradual and horrible worsening of symptoms over the last 14 days. I have had to start treatment with Benzo’s (as needed, I try to avoid them but sometimes there’s just no way around it) and they seem to help in some instances, whereas in others they only seem to do a moderate/poor job at managing the symptoms. For the first time in my life yesterday I suffered from ED. Never happened to me before and despite a very supporting and loving wife, I felt that was yet another crushing blow. The weird thing is that all these things are not getting me depressed – just really anxious.
 I can only hope that things will start to get better. I have no idea when these things would begin to get back on track. Doctors seem to be quite oblivious to my suffering, not really believing that withdrawal could be so powerful yet not finding ANYTHING else wrong. The situation is really frustrating.
 One thing is clear to me: I’m never, EVER going back on this horrendous drug. It was a huge mistake beginning with it, and for all of you who need these kind of drugs: ask your GP or Psychiatrist what are the withdrawal difficulties expected for the medication. I know I sure wish I had asked it.
 If anyone could share whether they’d experienced similar withdrawal symptoms and how long they’d persisted, I’d really appreciate your comments. I hope that by posting this someone else will also benefit as the internet searches are really frustrating as well.

"I find it staggering the amount of people who say they are having horrendous withdrawal symptoms from Mirtazapine discontinuation.
Mirtazapine has barely any serotonergic properties. At lower doses it is not serotonergic at all and is nothing more than an antihistamine.
Why do you think Mirtazapine can be combined with just about any other antidepressant out there without causing serotonin toxicity?
That begs the question, does Mirtazapine really cause withdrawal symptoms, especially since it can't really be classified as an antidepressant, and with its long half life, or is it all in your head?
And before you ask, yes I was on 45mg of Mirtazapine for some time and came off in a week with zero withdrawal symptoms.

My main issue (s) have been bloating (although that has gotten quite a bit better though still bloating some) but what's got me is having problems (which years ago I would have an issue with hurting underneath my rib cage from eating certain things beforehand I was ever on Remeron) but the problem that I just mentioned is an every day thing for the most part...if food doesn't seem to digest I get to hurting and if I drink water and make myself throw up the pain goes away and my doctor prescribed Bentyl for my bloating but I am so scared of medications that I haven't worked up the courage to try it because of it's possible side effects.

"Hello. May i know, has any of you experienced palpitations caused by mirtazapine? can mirtazapine cause it? I;ve read that fast heart rate could be one of the side effects. but based on my readings, it is quite rare and unlikely as compared to other antidepressants.
A little background of my story, i started taking mirt 15mg and aripiprazole 5mg since june last year. i;ve had no problem but in november i woke up with palpitations at night. at first i didnt suspect the meds, but i dont have anxiety in general. and i only get the palpitations at night after ive gone to bed. i get the palpitations once in awhile, and last jan i went to see the doctor and he said that arip is the one causing me palpitations and he gave me propranolol 10mg.
after that, i quit arip on my own but still take the propra because my intuition tells me that its mirt causing the palpitations. and although ive taken propra together with mirt, i noticed that i still get the palpitations once in awhile. i noticed that i will get the palpitations approx 2 hours after i took mirt. and ive read that mirt peak plasma is within 2 hours. but im not sure anymore. could this be just in my head and im being paranoid?
i need to know because im planning to quit propra soon because there;s no point being on it if mirt doesnt cause me palpitations. so if anyone has experience or info on this, please do let me know. thank you
btw, im taking the soltab orodispersible version.

"Ok Hello
This is my first post ever on the internet in a form type environment so please bare with me.
Mirtazapine 30 MG for the last 4 and a half years. Major Depression Disorder. Currently 2 weeks in to withdrawals since my last pill. I dropped down to 15 mg for 3 months, and then 7.5 mg for 2 months with the last 2 weeks taking 7.5 mg every other day.
This sucks but I am truly hoping I can ride out 1 more week and I will start feeling better. What am I experiencing.!! ? Itching, like crazy, usually only at night time and seems to be starting later in the evening as time goes on here. First couple of days I started itching at 5 pm. then pushed till 8 pm now it kicks in about 10. I have been taking benadryl and 45 min later the itching subsides so I can fall asleep. When I start itching it is very intense and am now burning through my skin. the Itch is like a burning itch it has to be touched or I go crazy.
Really don't want to keep taking benadryl as I am at 2 weeks on it now. But don't feel any other option works.
I am waking up early mornings 430 am ish when I usually am 730am. Sometimes I wake up itchy sometimes don't and can maybe fall back asleep for a few more hours.
I am having periods of feeling very tired and lethargic. I usually am able to gogogo all day. I have been napping and never usually do. I was doing some courses online but have no desire at the moment when I was so into it 4 weeks ago and was on a roll. I have been forcing every other day weight training and that feels good when doing it but have to get pretty mean with myself to get going. I left the house to go for a drive today and got in my car and felt like I was in a dream sort of. Am happy to be back on the couch now. I have been feeling very anti-social lately and have wanted to be left alone.
I understand what is going on with me but it is hard to not be frustrated and just want to jump back on them. I don't want to do that though so am willing and want to tough this out a lil longer.
Have been having periods of nausea and lack of appetite but keeping the diet clean when I do eat. Have lost 5 lbs of fat that I could never drop while taking the pills. Definitely feeling depressed but aware of it, which helps I suppose.!?!?
My bowel movements are all over the place.
Have been feeling fatigued physically and just sore at times. Lower back pain when I never have it before.
Wondering if anyone knows of some supplements to help with these types of issues and past experiences of coming off mirtazapine similarly to what I have and am experiencing.
My doctor support system is non existent as I am waiting for a family doctor locally after relocating across the country.
Any help and thoughts or questions help.
Thanks

"I have now been taking Metazapine 30 mg for 7 weeks and today is the worst day I have had since taking them. I went to the doctor's the other day and she said she wouldn't have any hesitation in putting me on the 45 mg. I said I would like to wait for 2 weeks to see what happens. She said that all Antidepressants take weeks to kick in.
I used to be on Venlafaxine and within 2 weeks I would be back to normal. I was on them for 10 years. I used to come off them after about a year but would always have to go back on them eventually. Then a GP friend asked why I kept coming off them so I decided to stay on them. Then they stopped working and I was tried on various SSRIs which didn't work. I am hesitant about taking the 45 mg in case I get some of the awful side feeects that I read about on this Forum.

"I keep reading on this forum how mirtazapine is an evil drug; how people want to get off it as soon as possible etc.  Very few posts saying it helps them.
I appear for the defence , M'Lud. 
I was on SSRI antidepressants for some time.  They countered my extreme anxiety well, but I had bad insomnia probably caused by the  AD.  I tried various drugs for the insomnia (zopiclone,  amitriptyline etc) but with little success.   My doctor suggested mirtazapine but I declined as I had read about its weight gain side effect.  However eventually I changed my mind out of desparation.  The mirt was miraculous: it completely solved the insomnia.   I felt ""normal"" for the first time in months. 
""But what about the side effects"" I hear you say.  Well, I did get back my appetite - but no more than it was before I became ill.   I gained a little weight, but no more than I had lost.
I did have difficulty getting up in the morning and feeling groggy after that, but those lessened with time. I take the minimum mirt that allows me to get to sleep - about 11mg,  and I think that keeps the side effects down.
Mirtazapine is like a knife in that it is not evil in itself, it is how it is used that matters.   The people who say it is evil have perhaps been on the wrong dose.  Mirt tends to be more sedative at low doses; more activating at high doses.   Do not throw out the baby with the bath water!
I get the impression from reading posts on this forum that mirt is best used (at low dose) to counter insomnia or where an SSRI antidepressant has not been tolerated.

"Has anyone else experienced muscle pain, jaw clenching or muscle spasms on mirtazapine?
My GP is recommending it as an alternative to sertraline which I had to abruptly stop due to awful jaw clenching that was exacerbating my chronic TMJ issue.
I'm not sure whether to attempt a new antidepressant after the horror of sertraline so would be interested to hear other peoples' experiences. We hope that by taking it, it might rectify the stress and anxiety contributing to my TMJ issue.

"Hi. I was prescribed Mirtazapine for an anxiety crisis I got more than 2 months ago. I had OCD and Anxiety all my life but hadn't impeded me for the most part.
Ive taken 7.5mg for 4 days, then 15mg for a month, then 30mg for 5 weeks.
I noticed some significant improvements only until this last, 5th week of 30mg mirtazapine, when I moved to my parent's house, which make me doubt the improvements were from the mirtazapine, which should've showed up on the first two weeks.
Reading so many horror stories about coming off gave me an even greater conviction to leave it now that I've taken for only over two months than later.
PLEASE READ: This thread is intended for SUCCESS STORIES. We're trying to find a pattern on how it went well on people. If you're going to leave reply on a success story to tell how bad it's going on for you, please don't, there's no interest in this thread on your symptoms or whatsoever unless you're doing well now. This is about people who already came off it. We've had enough of bad stories and those plague even the success story threads, which make them useless to read.
If you came of mirtazapine a long time ago, even better.
Thank you.

"Guys, I don't believe this...
I don't know how many of you are familiar with me; I have been on here for a couple of months now, making posts and talking about my Mirtazapine experience. Now, recently, I have decided to begin slowly coming off the drug, because I am not happy with it and the things it's doing to my body. 
Now, I have health anxiety; I'm slowly beginning to reign it in, but it's still there. So, the smallest things startle me and send me off the boil. Recently, I went to my GP because I have been suffering with pains in my... wait for it, there's a list... my forearms, my wrists, my hands, my fingers, the joints in my fingers; I have a shoulder that has been messed up for months, and refuses to get better. I get sore legs, sore knees, feet, and all this time I have been thinking... I am going bonkers; I'm going absolutely bonkers.
I had convinced myself I had Fibromayalga, which is highly unlikely, given that I am 27 years old, and a man. The doctor looked at me as if I had sprouted a second head. Anyway, the doctor diagnosed some things he thought it might be - Tennis Elbow, Tendonitis, slight muscle inflammation, or simply just my body being stiff and tense from being anxious so frequently.
Now, recently, I looked up the side effects of Mirtazapine, and low and behold, some topics from this very site came up and there were people going through exactly what I am going through. Granted, those threads were from quite some time ago; we're talking years ago. So, I decided to post this, to see if there are any members currently on here that have experienced or are currently experiencing these kinda symptoms.
I'm referring, mostly, to joint and muscle pain (my muscles also twitch quite frequently).
So... anybody with me?

"I deal with chronic pain due to various spinal issues. A few months ago I was started on buspirone, twice a day, total of 15 mg. I spiraled more into panic, frankly downright fear, and had no appetite. 7.5 mg of Remeron was added at that point.
What started to happen is soreness, muscle cramps, pins and Needles, burning.
I also recently found out I have a condition called SSCD. That however doesn’t cause this. Did a bit of research and I see that these are not very uncommon symptoms for people on this medication.
it became so bad and so frightening that I had an EMG test because my muscles felt so weak and sore there was a fear I had a particular muscle disease. Thankfully, the neuromuscular specialist who conducted the test said there was no evidence of that.
so, now I am thinking it is this medication. I was on the BuSpar for well over a month before I started this medication, so I don’t think it is that.
I want to get off of this medication, but I am terribly afraid. I feel damned if I do and damned if I don’t. Because of the symptoms I am actually going for a brain MRI!
another interesting article I found said that people taking Allegra, which I do, and Remeron have reported fibromyalgia type symptoms. Which makes me hopeful that some of these things are coming from this medication.
I want off of this medication to see if some of my pain improves. But I am terribly afraid. I haven’t been taking it for very long, but from everything I’ve read it doesn’t take long for people to experience issues.
do I start cutting it in half for a couple of weeks, there is so much conflicting information.
thank you in advance for any feedback or information, I appreciate it.

These type of things are why I would want to drink in a safe enviroment first. Is there anything I should know before I do this? Is it safe? Are there any fatal risks to this?

"Advice to come off Mirtazapine after 2 months
Hi.
If you would like to skip the details on the last 2 months and get to the question, you can skip to the ""**********"" I left, although I'd appreciate the company of being read.
I'm 27 years old and I want to explain briefly my experience, hoping I could get replies from people who relate to it or parts of it, and get advice on how to get through this.
I had anxiety issues all my life but they weren't completely incapacitating. I tended to have very physical symptoms of anxiety like fatigue and muscle twitches, which would typically pass; A LOT of IBS.
Starting march this year I had been experiencing worsening of anxiety probably from being 3 months jobless, I used to sleep very late at night, probably 3-4 am, and wake up very late too, 1-2 pm; I was categorically depressed, extremely fatigued during the day, but played videogames and so on. A GP gave me tramadol, 5 drops each meal (that's 3 times a day) until I saw a psychiatrist. I first did my blood and thyroid tests that came out great. Then I had some throat twitch or spasm when falling asleep, like swallowing, that would wake me up and not let me sleep. This caused me panic form fear of not being able to sleep, and after just 2 or 3 nights I ran to the psychiatrist. I had already stopped tramadol and first I was given just quetiapine for a few nights, and could sleep, although spent the days immensely anxious and afraid of these twitches, my sleep and my health.
---7.5 to 15 mg---
Then a different psychiatrist changed it to mirtazapine 7.5 mg for about 4 nights, then up to 15 mg, plus Zolpidem(nocte) 10 mg to sleep and regularize sleep schedules.
The reason for mirtazapine was that I had vortioxetine in the past, an SRRI, and it gave me nausea that persisted for 3 weeks, and mirtazapine is an atypical antidepressant unlike vortioxetine. I also had sertraline for no more than 2 weeks some year before that, with no side effects, just no benefits, and I was impatient. I suspended both vortioxetine and sertraline back then without issue, and didnt take any meds for years after that, until now.
Anyway I began sleeping again although at very frist it was complicated and anxious from the crazy anxiety I constantly had. Then things got more stable but I was very depersonalized, I was disconnected, derealized, I couldn't focus on complex tasks (I'm a programmer, I also like drawing and painting digital art). I could hardly listen to music without it being numb, I couldn't watch a movie on the telly without feeling anxious.
I had sometimes these brief moments of intense tranquility and happiness, when I felt back to being myself, lasting about 30 minutes, but they were rare and few.
I had a lot of pressure to feel better because of a 2 week disney trip with my sister and her husband's family, that had been postponed for more than a year. I hated the thought of being there while depersonalized.
So I consulted another psychiatrist and he suggested paroxetine 12.5 and risperidone on top of the mirtazapine to help the depersonalization.
I got serotonine syndrome after 2 doses, and I took 3; most likely due to the paroxetine. I had isolated horrible panick attacks, high pulse rate, chills that felt like burning skin all over my body, I tought I'd lose my mind. The effects passed after about a week, but I was still depersonalized and with anxiety.
---30 mg---
So I got my mirtazapine dose raised to 30mg. Since I take it at night, the first night I felt some physical anxiety that I could tell seemed from the medicine, but then went to sleep maybe with the help of Zolpidem.
The next week I didn't notice much improvement, I was still anxious and fatigued during the day, and not myself; although I lowered the Zolpidem dose to half, which felt good. The sudden moments of happiness and of feeling myself I described wouldn't happen again after the 30mg dose though, although I could rarely get ""close"" to it when I managed to relax once.
I went to disney, the happiest place on earth, and it wasn't nice for the most part. The first half I could spend the days very very anxious, sometimes worse, and not myself. Some rides would even scare me when I know I wouldn't get scared, I wasn't reacting to things I love the way I would, which in itself made me feel worse. The last few days of vacation were better, but the times I enjoyed or even laughed I still could tell I wasn't myself. I also found that most of the times I couldn't take naps or sleep during the day because I get anxiety dreams, sleep paralysis, that tick on my throat, etc etc, but I slept well every night during the trip's 2 weeks and until now when I'm writing this (just an extra 1-2 weeks).
The doctor said that improvements should've been seen during the first week of the 30mg dose, but I don't think mirtazapine has helped much at any dosage either for anxiety or depersonalization. She tried to mention improvements that I think could've happened just with the passing of time and my own adaptation, like some other time I had a big anxiety episode, and not because of the medicine.
She even made up improvements of things I didn't even say I had, like ""you no longer have so much nightmares"". Mirtazapine made me dream a lot, some of them anxiety dreams (worse than nightmares) and yes, it wore off. But it's no improvement to improve from an issue that I didn't even have without mirtazapine.
So, recap, it's now been 4 days on 7.5 mg, then about 3 weeks on 15 mg (when I took the paroxetine and the risperidone and had serotonine syndrome), and 4 weeks on 30 mg. So that's About two months now.
She suggested to add aripiprazole, an antipsychotic, on top of the 30 mg mirtazapine; 1/4 of a 15 mg pill for 4 days, then up to 1/2.
I'm not taking more pills, didn't even buy it.
After the disney trip I've spent the last few days at my hometown where I was born (I live alone in big city), and I have noticed more improvements being here, which, being at the end of the 4th week of the 30 mg mirt dose, I doubt they are from the mirt, but from being with my family, feeling safer with my dad, etc. I wish I had gone here before taking any medicine.
It sometimes is discouraging to know that people think I'm well when I'm not yet well nor entirely myself (for instance, I still don't play my music). And worse, that I can't explain how I feel or feel understood because no one else here has felt this way. Also, I don't try to explain to protect them from my suffering when I know they are enjoying themselves; what I go through sounds scary to everyone.
Sometimes I feel like I act like myself from memory.
Anyway, the 2 main reasons why I want to come off mirtazapine are these (apart from it not having done much or nothing against my anxiety and depersonalization):
First, I have a little journal, which is somewhat incomplete. The first time I wrote on it about feeling depersonalized I believe was after taking the first 7.5 mg dose, which was right after my anxiety crisis started. Although at first I attributed it to having been a few days through a lot of anxiety, now I suspect mirtazapine to be the culprit of this so prolonged feeling.
Second, because I've read about getting off it, and sounds horrible. I'm scared of the medicine, I'm scared of getting off it, and I'm more scared of getting off it the more time I spend with it, because I know, irregardless, everyone gets off it at some point, except most people got benefits while taking it.
I've been through the worst experiences and doubts of my life and now, from what I've read, I may be up for even more.
Since I've improved since being with my dad, I'm also afraid to interrupt that to get off the medicine.
I was very suicidal at my worst moments, I've come to feel in ways I didn't even know existed, and to get off mirtazapine makes me fear for my life because of what I may feel. But to stay on it makes me afraid of it changing me for bad when I haven't felt myself, plus knowing that I have to get off it at some point anyway and most likely go through it anyway. I'm afraid of the insomnia some people have mentioned they are left with, I don't know for how long, while I also have to come off zolpidem at some point, which I also don't know if I ever needed. I wish I had never taken it, and now I want to get off it the best way possible.
I always thought I had so much to give to others, and the last two months I'd hardly wanted to have a conversation. I fear for my life and my loved ones form whom I want to be well again.
I would like some guidance on what I should do after 2 months of mirtazapine, how I should do it, and what your experiences have been. I trust that more than I trust psychiatrists now, who seem to know nothing.

"Hello All,
This is my first post on this website.
Sorry it's a long one...
I have seen other threads that are about this topic but none that are recent.
I have been on mirtazapine 15mg for 4.5 years (since Nov 2016) when I went through a period of suicidal depression after working long shift work and not being able to do my job.
I had 3 years of almost complete bliss - I practised mindfulness everyday, meditated everyday and could enjoy life without constant thought making noise in my head. In the early months I found 7.5mg perfect.
In 2019 I had some big arguments with my mother throughout the year and combined with a long commute to London, I felt the effects of Mirtazapine were no longer as strong as before.
In October 2019 I went on holiday where I caught a virus where I had a severe sore throat, severe fever, very dry cough (like a chest infection but no phlegm even though it felt like I should have), lost my sense of taste, lost my sense of smell etc you get what I am trying to say (and yes it was October 2019..). It got so bad I felt suicidal, which is weird as I was on holiday. I don't remember much about when I flew back but I think I still had chest pain and was still suffering.
After returning, my cat became very ill. The following three weeks was spent trying to keep my cat alive, sadly she died in Nov 2019. A week later I woke up one day and I had weird sensations where I felt like I hadn't slept at all even after 8-12 hours sleep, was dizzy, faint, headachey, problems with my balance.
After that day I suffered from feeling like I haven't slept, shaking, muscle weakness, noticeably shorter breath/breathlessness, prickly skin, brain fog etc
Since Nov 2019, I have had well over 10 blood tests and many phone appointments with GP who do not seem to care about the pathetic weakness I am suffering from. I have been tried on many different magic potions including:
*Pregabalin + Mirtazapine 15mg
Trazadone - no Mirtazapine
Amitryptiline + Lower Mirtazapine to 7.5mg
Sertraline + 7.5mg Mirtazapine
Propranolol + 15mg Mirtazapine
one or two Benzodiazepines + 15mg Mirtazapine
Upping my Mirtazapine to 30mg, though only managed 22.5mg and felt like I couldn't move no more.
I feel I am missing one or two other medications I have tried but you get the picture. None, absolutely none helped my condition.
I spent most of 2019/2020 guessing different ailments/diseases/syndromes I might have ranging from diabetes to balamuthia mandrillaris, because no one was helping me.
After pestering my GP enough (calling basically every week to say I am still feeling like I have been awake since 2019), he finally gave up and diagnosed me with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
From what I know CFS is caused by a combination of virus infection, bereavement, crazy stressful situations like car crashes etc. I feel mine might have been caused by combination of virus, my cat dying, commute being stressful and also being on Mirtazapine.
I have tried coming off mirtazapine and basically end up fluctuating my dose because I think my mind is conditioned that it will help me like the first few years of taking it, but it just makes my CFS even worse and possibly even the cause of it.
Since suffering these terrible symptoms (already was suffering them) I have lost my job and my house.
Anyone else had something similar?

"I’ve been on Mirtazapine for about a year, take 45mg. It doesn’t seem to work as well as it first did. I also have epilepsy and take two med for it and had break through seizures recently. I can only afford the generics, the name brands cost $1300/mo. I looked through the web and found people complain about which generic manufactures people complained about and which ones they liked or non of the above compared to the real stuff. I’m going to my Dr. today and ask him to wrote down which generic manufacture I want me to take my prescription refill. Apparently all generics are not the same.
So the question is has anyone experienced or noticed the same thing with Mirtazapine manufactures. I haven’t kept track with which generic I’ve been taking. Currently the manufacture I am using is made by Aurobindo which I found out is made in India. People in the anti-seizure forums complained about India manufactures. I assume each generic also has to be different form other generics and India seems to be at the bottom of the list. Has anyone noticed who makes the generics you take and any difference?

"Hello,
Male 34 years. I have been on Mirta for about 3 weeks. It seems everyday I get worse pain in my forearms and hands. Even writing this post is causing me quite terrible pain in my right arm. My everyday work in the home office gives me huge struggle, everyday it gets worse somehow. I tested the nerves in my arm, speed etc and a mrt from my neck was made. Everything was fine. Just today it appeared to me to that Mirta could be responsible for this. This drug is helping me really good in regards to my anxiety and sleep but this side effect seems to be unbearable. Anyone else made such an experience? the pain is basically chronic in my right forearm and intermittent pain in my palm and tingling fingers. Same started to happen for my left arm, but i am not doing anything with this this arm. Worst is bending my arm, lifting the arm hurts also. every daily activity is basically impossible. I was one time running last week and my arms hurt so much after. The doctor meant it looks like tennis elbow and gave me anti inflammatory painkillers. but it does not help. I think i need get off of this drug asap, but i am terrified. somebody else made a similar experience and found a solution? any suggestions for a good antidepressants to switch to for anxiety primarly. I want talk to my GP for this. I am on this drug only for 3 weeks. I am about to lose my mind. I depend on this drug but the physical pain gets unbearable. This is my first antidepressant i ever took I treated my anxiety for a long time with baclofan, but it stopped working after years
Thank you so much.

"Was on venlefaxine for about 8 weeks up to 112mg. Only a week up there, but got really harsh depression so while i tapered down (37.5 mg every 10 days) I was put on mirt 15mg. Sleep was helped immediately... thankfully. After about a month at 15 (and completely off the venlefaxine, the mirt was bumped to 30 because sleep seemed to be a little spotty again. Doctor didn't seem to know the lower dose is better for sleep apparently.
Sleep at 30 has been ""ok"" but now I'm at about 33 days at 30mg, and about 2 months total on mirt, the sleep seems to be changing more. I'm getting around 6-7 hours, which is good enough for me but I'm waking up pretty early. like 430-5 am sometimes. i have to be in bed by 1030 or sleep will suffer.
I started AD's when i started really horrific post acute withdrawl syndrom after having to quit weed and alcohol back in December. I'm doing a lot better now. i couldn't answer the phone, read books (except a couple super boring ones just to pass time) and tv was pretty much a no go. I was a total mess. It's been about 5 months since i started my journey to sobriety, so I'm thinking this time passed has really helped me adjust and feel better, along with the help of the mirt. I even handled a visit to the dentist for a filling that there would have been no way to go to before. (i cancelled a dentist appointment a couple months ago).
I have been getting these weird anxiety heart flutter feelings
mostly in the evening now, and a bit obsessive sometimes... (Reading here lol) I still feel the need to be busy doing things outside or i get anxious. hard to stay at my desk because i feel like i need to be outside etc... but these have been managable. I've also noticed abdominal muscles feeling tighter lately.. over the past week or so.. worse as the day goes on into the evenings.
I don't want to up the mirt, i feel the more i take the deeper I'll get into them. Same with the time I've been on them. Every day on mirt is deeper to be into them... The harder to taper off.
So at about 2.5 months on mirt, 35 days or so at 30, i was thinking about maybe going to 15mg for 15-30 days, then 7.5 (15-30) then maybe off, or maybe every second day... I'm going to be talking to my psyc doc about this too.. I'm just curious what others who may have been in a similar situation may have done or how it went?
anyone else have only 2-3 months on mirt? what was or would be a good schedule for taper at this short time of use?

"I have been taking 15mg of Mirtazapine for roughly a year and a half, I have just started tapering 3 days ago doing the 10% every month method. I know my body reacts easily to any form of drug, recreational or medicinal, so I knew this entire process was going to be difficult. On day one, I felt anxious when I woke up and very depressed at night (not sure if this is from placebo or if the first cut had immediate effects), and slightly nauseous throughout the day. Day 2 was much easier, the nauseous feeling was on and off but not serious at all. Today is day 3, I couldn't sleep last night until 6:30am, woke up late at 4:00pm and I felt decent up until now, 9:15pm where I felt nauseous again and had to lie down.
I have a medical cannabis prescription and have been medicating throughout the day everyday to counteract the anxiety and nausea and it is working for the most part. I decided to make this post to ask everyone else that has gone through this or is currently going through this, what have you been doing/taking to mitigate these negative side effects? They're getting in the way of some projects I'm working on, and I believe soon my workplace will be opening up again and if these side effects keep persisting, I won't be able to work. Anything helps, thanks!

"Okay, so all of this is going to be a lot. So bare with.
For the last 6 months ish. I've been on 30mg of Prosac ( fluoxetine), and at night ive been taking a 5mg Nitrazepam for my insomnia.
The last three months or so ive been trying to cut down on the benzo (Nitrazepam). Whilst simultaneously cutting the benzo down to a half. I got told by my auntie by all people that Mirtazapine would help aid sleep.
Cut to two months of cutting down on benzos, and i guess moving onto Mitazapine (15MG). Ive been feeing physically ill. Sick to my stomach. Nausea. Pains. Mentally unwell. Anxiety at its all time
high. I just assumed oh god, this is all relating to cutting down on benzo oh god its the prosac— I looked up what Mitazapine was last night. Yes, it helps aid sleep. But its a Anti Depressant....
For the last two months ive been adding another anti depressant into my system that isnt even prescribed to me. Yes. I should know better, im 21. Yes, i should've contacted my doctor. But, if my auntie said it was okay, its for sleep, i just believed her. However, now looking at it. I dont even believe she knew herself it was an anti depressant.
I now stopped taking this mitazapine since last night. I still feel physically I'll to my stomach and in pain. I am reliefed to have found all this
out though. Someone tell me im
not crazy. That maybe why my
mental health has plumated to an all time low. Has to be related to mixing two different anti depressants, unknowingly knowing that mitazapine is an anti depressant.
Ive got a doctors appointment tomorrow. Initially was going to be a medical review to either stop my prozac/ to increase it. But oh god, the appointment. I honestly dont know what my doctor is going to say or do.
My question is. Ive been taking mitazpine last two months (15mg), and only last few weeks ive been feeling extremely sick internally and mentally. Since stopping taking them yesterday. How long will the withdrawl, this feeling of sickness last?

"Hi
Having tried Citalopram (and passing out 2 hours later), I was moved onto Mirtazapine, as I previously passed out on Prozac so SSRIs were not recommended.  I started on 15mg on Mirtazapine and after 2 months the sleeping was great, but I did not feel it was touching the depression itself. 
I was increased to 30mg just over two weeks ago and since then I have felt worse than I did before the increase.  I wasn't sure if this was due to putting pressure on myself to be ok over christmas (I have a lovely wife and two children and didn't want to spoil it), but have spent some part of each day in tears.  I just feel frustrated at feeling depressed and despondant I guess. 
I was considering droppoing down the Mirtazpine to 15mg again but realised it has only been two weeks (not the three I originally thought it had been).
Anyone have any experience of whether initially increasing their dose temporarily set them back, its so hard to know what to do for the best

"Hello everyone. I have been reading through quite a few posts on the subject of mirtazapine withdrawal. Most of the posts I see are from people who have spent months and months tapering their dose down to 3.75 with mild to severe side effects, to then finally stop and suffer a withdrawal period that is no better or worse than a complete cold turkey off 45mg.
I personally feel like the NHS have completely conned a lot of people into antidepressant dependancy, not necessarily GP's but the big cheeses at the top who tell the practices to push certain drugs at certain times.
I feel like they have certainly caused me a lot if harm, and that the big companies who are making billions of dollars off these pills do not want you off these meds.
what i am really trying to say is that going cold turkey is really no worse than gradually stopping. Coming off 3.75 feels exactly the same as coming off 45mg! It just takes a lot more time to wein off, and you will be more likely to get fed up and retreat back into their arms. They would rather give advice that will be more likely to result in you staying on meds for life (lining the government/pharmacuticals pockets than be free.
i have had good and bad days, but i feel better if i eat healthy meals with omega 3&6 supplements, a handful of cashew nuts a day & a glass of carrot juice
hope this helps someone

"Background: I was prescribed clonazepam and alprazolam for anxiety attack (I never had anxiety before this I think it was brought on by malnutrition due to extreme dieting - i was only eating 1 meal a day) last NOv 2019. I took it for a month but didnt feel good so I consulted another psychiatrist who put me on mirt to wean me off the drugs. I took 30mg mirt from dec 2019 and in aug 2020 we started to taper. 15mg for one month and then 15mg every other day and that ended in early Nov 2020. I had no issues while doing the taper. then on dec 9 i had an anxiety attack out of nowhere and things have been progressing badly ever since. my most bothersome symptoms are burning skin (head to toe), slight tremor on my left pinky finger, loud tinnitus (both ears - high pitch And Pulsatile!). ive never been depressed my whole life but now I feel utter hopelessness and despair that 1) inhave an incurable disease 2) i will be stuck this way forever
is anybody else going thru this?! I really feel so alone and would like some reassurance...

"Hi everyone, I wondered if anyone has had any experience of switching from Mirtazapine to Fluoxetine? I started taking Mirtazapine two months ago after struggling with insomnia. It became so awful I went to my doctors and they prescribed sleeping pills, Zopiclone. After these didnt work, I felt desperate, and actually suicidal, and my doctor suggested trying Mirtazapine. At first I thought they were AMAZING....I slept properly for the first time in months and most of the next day too. I felt groggy for a few days but this wore off and it just felt like my sleep had re-set to how it used to be. Unfortunately, as I now realise is very common after reading lots of other reviews, I started gaining weight. My appetite has been ridiculous...my stomach is like a bottomless pit that I cant satisfy. I decided to go on a diet a month ago and despite feeling ravenous most of the time, I stuck to a really rigid diet and upped my daily excercise. I lost 2 pounds, but unbelievably put them back on again even though I have changed nothing. I really think Mirtazapine does something to metabolism because I have put on a stone and half. I have a lot of willpower, I gave up drinking and smoking 8 years ago. So I rang my doctors today and I am going to reduce the mirtazapine from 30mg to 15mg for a week, then she told me to stop taking them altogether for four days, then start taking fluoxetine. I'm really worried about my insomnia coming back though I think it was triggered by anxiety so hoping the fluoxetine will deal with that. I have been on fluoxetine lots of times in the past so I know that they work for me. But I'm also worried that the guidelines they have given me for switching from one antidepressant to another is way too quick....I've read some horror stories on the withdrawal from mirtazapine being horrendous. I'm starting a new job in a few weeks and moving house in a week so I'm probably choosing the worst time to come off them!! I just keep catching sight of myself in the mirror and feeling so shocked at how big I've got. I know that everyone is different but I would really appreciate any advice/experience of anyone who has switched from Mirtazapine to fluoxetine. Thank you! xx

"Hi all
I'm really hoping you can help - this is regarding my mum rather than myself.
My mum (and myself) have been on Citilapram for a long time, mainly for seratonin imbalance.
My mum has had a lot of health problems over the years mainly with her back and nervous system. Because of this the doc has swapped her from this over to Mirtazapine.
Firstly, having done some research I understand most people have a cross over period when swapping anti depressants. Mum didn't (and in fact wasnt aware this was a 'thing'). Secondly, she started off on 15mg and has now been moved to 30mg following her reporting that she was feeling suicidal and completely lost after a few weeks of being on 15mg of it (she has never felt like this in her life before). The doc immediately upped her dosage to 30mg and she has been on this dosage for 1 week now (total of 7 weeks on the drug in total).
Since upping the dosage a week ago she feels worse. Having again done some research it should take 4-6 weeks for the drug to settle in the system. Its now been 7.
Has anyone else experienced this? is this normal? is this going to subside? I am very conscious that this may not be the right drug for her. Having never felt suicidal off citilapram - why up the dosage of a drug that is making her feel like this?!
Any experiences or advice greatly appreciated

I am going through peri-menopause and I had my first period in eight weeks this weekend. I noticed that it made me feel a LOT worse. I can barely work, or function.
And I am worried about insomnia and menopause induced depression. So, I am wondering if anyone has had any experience withdrawing prior to menopause and if anyone thinks I should maybe wait until that stage of my life has passed?
Thanks in advance for your help!

"Hi Guys,
Just wanted to give some hope to those struggling with Mirtazapine withdrawal.  Long story short I was given WAY too high a dose of mirt. to help with occasional insomnia a few years ago and my body had a terrible reaction (Constant Anxiety, Depression when I had never been depressed before, etc.) I told my psychiatrist that I wanted to come off and they said I could come off of 45mg cold turkey (which is a laughable statement in hindsight) and thats what I did.  I dropped to 7.5mg immediately and stayed there until coming off completely.  Que the most difficult few months of my life.  The main effects of WD were really intense depersonalization/derealization, suicidal thoughts, occasional panic/anxiety, and just general confusion.  I've been off mirt. for about a year and a half now and I'm just starting to feel back to my normal self.  I want people to know that it can take a really long time for the WD effects to go away, but if you listen to your body and mind you WILL see it through.  Just take it as slow as you need to.  This whole experience actually has led to some of the best times of my life, and i wouldn't have made the lifestyle changes I did unless that happened.  Here are some of the things I did to help me through the WD:
-Meditation(LIFE SAVER)
-Asked my Doctor for small amount of Ativan to help with the anxiety in the first few months
-Explained my situation to my family/friends

"I've followed many stories on this forum and they've all helped me a lot. I thought I would also share my story.
First of all, I managed to get away with only putting on around 5lbs by the fact I simply do not eat when I'm stressed, upset or down. So even though the food cravings were high at times, I still did not really want to eat. Prior to this I had been on a diet (where I lost 30lbs) with the help of a high protein, low calorie diet and Orlistat. I kept this going (mostly). I think the protein and Orlistat really helped. However, even though I was not really putting weight on, I was going to a lot of effort to just remain at the same weight. I weighed out the options and decided to get off Mirtazapine.
My weight is probably a bigger problem for me than the issues that led me to needing the Mirtazapine in the first place. I tried to taper, so I went from 15mg to 7.5mg in just one day, then I went to 3.75mg a day later, then the following day and then just thought 'in for a penny, in for a pound' and I went cold turkey. I did this for several reasons: 1) The end of Covid is in sight and I know that I will feel much happier looking my best for the summer 2) Many years ago, I went cold turkey from Sertraline and I do not recall any withdrawal symptoms. I also gave up smoking quite easily many years ago. From what I gather, different people react to things like this differently.
I did have some withdrawal symptoms. A lot of crying, sadness and some anxiety. I also felt like I had the flu. I have to say though this all passed in like 4 days.
To replace the Mirtazpaine I have combined the advice from several posts and every morning I take 5HTP (100mg), Vitamin B Complex, Magnesium (500mg), multivitamin, Vitamin D3 (4000 IU), and some Inositol with my protein shake every morning. I also have the 5-HTP with my lunch and sometimes with dinner. I feel amazing to be honest. The sadness seems to be diminishing slowly, I don't get any withdrawal symptoms.
The Inositol is very unusual, you can feel it working. I didn't believe it when I read it, but I highly recommend you give it a go. It really helps calm my anxiety. I usually space it out over the day. Just be careful, if you have a sensitive stomach or you have a large amount you will need to go to the toilet!
To combat the sleep I bought some first generation antihistamines (Promethazine hydrochloride) to try and partly re-create what the Mirtazapine was doing. I am eventually going to need to find a longer term solution to this, but I can tell you a good night sleep has also helped me so much.
In terms of weight loss, I'm very happy how this is going. I am eating less than I did, I'm fuller for longer, still on a low calorie, high protein diet. I am seeing the fat basically dropping off me. I feel extremely lucky that I'm not going through some of the withdrawals others are.
I did search the forums for some stories where going cold turkey worked, but it was a bit difficult to find. Mirtazapine was a miracle drug and if it wasn't for the weight gain, I would have 100% stayed on it. I asked my doctor not to put me on an SSRI (I didn't like the Sertraline many years ago) and the Mirtazapine helped, it gave me my life back by just being there when I needed it and help me get to sleep.

"So I was taking 15mgs of Mirtazapine a day for a couple of years to address insomnia and health anxiety, and then tapered down to 7.5mgs for about a month or so and then at the end of July I stopped altogether. The first month off saw me experiencing problems with sleep, itching skin etc, but all of that seemed to pass in time and I thought I was through the worst of it. However for the last week and a half I've had increasingly bad pains in my feet, legs, hands and sometimes arms too, the pains are especially bad at night and especially when lying on my front or either side, like the pressure of my body pressing down against the mattress is causing them, but also just when lying on my back, to the point where I struggle to sleep every single night.
The pain is similar to the pain you get when you constrict the blood flow to a limb by accident, and I don't mean pins and needles or numbness, but actual pain, the pains are quite short and sharp and feel neuropathic in nature. I also experience them throughout the day but I perhaps notice them less as I'm distracted with other things, and sometimes it's painful just touching things or leaning against things, and sometimes it's not exactly pain but like an awareness of the bones and it feels like they're against a hard surface all the time, especially the bones in my feet as I walk along.
The doc didn't seem to have a clue about what this could be as I stopped the Mirtazapine over 6 weeks ago now, and sent me for various blood tests and his main advice was to go back on the Mirtazapine, but I am reluctant to do that as if these pains are caused by the withdrawal, how bad will they be further down the line if I keep taking the medication?! Both my aunts have MS so I'm really terrified that these pains might be the start of MS, although I want to believe it's part of the withdrawal from the Mirtazapine. Has anyone else experienced symptoms like this so long after stopping the medication? If anyone's got any advice or insight I would be super grateful.

"I stopped taking mirtazapine in January, almost four months ago, and since then I have had a number of symptoms which were not present 12 months ago before starting this medication. They include:
extreme emotional numbness and anhedonia
nonexistent appetite
nonexistent motivation (every action feels like it takes 100 times more effort than it should)
This does not appear to be getting any better and I feel like this drug has totally destroyed my brain. I f****d up my entire life by taking it. Can anyone tell me if there is a way out for me? I am done with medications, I just want to return to the way I was before this stupid drug.

"Male
Age : 39
Time on Mirt: 10 months April '17 til Feb '18
Time off Mirt: 7 MONTHS! And counting
Dosage: 30 mg most of the time, then 45 for one month, back to 30 for a while and then progressively less until nothing.
Reason for going on Mirt: Sudden onset of insomnia and anxiety/ depression due to failed business project
Feel better now?: Hell yeah
Previous medication: 1 year on Citalopram in 2012
Disclaimer: I could sleep fine before I had a sudden onset of Insomnia that wouldn't shift. I was put on Mirtazapine only so there were no side effects from other meds. Once off Mirt, exercise, meditating 10 mins a day, Vitamin D tablets and believing there was a hopeful future for me was instrumental to getting me feeling as good as I do now. There are still down periods but not for long as the brain gets used to thinking proactively and I can bounce back. Now read on:
I am writing this to help Mirtazapine users who want to get off it. I immediately felt increased anxiety and dread when starting Mirt, comparable to nothing I'd ever felt before. There was not enough caution from my Doctor in recommending it to me for my insomnia and anxiety symptoms. It was like using a sledgehammer to kill an ant . In a 'funny' coincidence the same doctor recommended it to a female work colleague of mine, who then had a panic attack at work and immediately got off it. She told me about it in confidence when we were talking about antidepressants one day. Another person I know felt like driving into oncoming traffic once on Mirt.  It made me realise I wasn’t the only one who felt so bad on it. My experience was 3 weeks of extreme unease followed by 2 weeks of calm x the whole time I was on it. The doctor's answer to my worry over Mirt's roller coaster effects was to bump up the dose. This didn't work. My answer to this was to change to a kinder doctor who listened and didn't discourage my efforts to get off it. On the bad stretches there was churning stomach action most of the time, diarrhoea, weight loss, paranoia, feeling of the world moving too fast, worthlessness, no self esteem, suicidal ideation, low level tinnitus after starting Mirt (and I still have it now), fear and dread of getting through work another day, weird envy and inferiority issues,and social anxiety that cut me off from my friends. ( Some 'friends' are not helpful because they put pressure on you to explain yourself in the guise of being a do-gooder. In my desperate state I didn't have the capability to assert myself and tell them to give me space. ) Facebook was a minefield with its inferior comparisons with other people's lives. Memory and concentration were shot and I was certain I'd never get them back. I would describe myself as a sad, scared zombie who couldn't cope with day to day life. So why stay on this crap?  Well It was the only thing helping me sleep- what if I stopped it, I would be screwed? Secondly It was often said in the forums that Mirt was harder to get off than crack, i.e practically impossible and would take multiple years.This was a supposed fact I accepted. Don't believe it. We are stronger than we know. I took me 4 months not years and I was on 30 mg. Maybe this is too fast for most people but you have to push yourself. So how to get off? According to the forums it was a pretty convoluted process with dilutions of liquid Mirt being mentioned and sometimes scales. Well all I used was my trusty Equadose pill cutter.
I used the marks on the pill as a reference where to cut each day.The first month I cut off microscopic amounts with the thought I was committing to years of pill cutting. This gave me some bad side effects, though similar to my normal bad days on it. I read someones post on this forum saying don’t waste years of your life - try to get off it quicker. I was angry at how bad Mirt made me feel and thought ‘to hell with it’ so that is what I did. Cut more off. I had nothing to lose. It just sped up the roller coaster so instead of such long stretches feeling like crap, they passed quicker. Wow you'd feel it if the cut was slightly too big. Man it was a tedious exercise. I had crappy oblong pills so the cutting wasn't extremely accurate -it wasn’t easy. But that's all I could do. When I finally got down to small enough amounts I'd order the next dose down from my understanding doc. 30 mg was the smallest dose of Mirt I could buy here so there was lots of cutting ahead of me. My doc said do I want some Quitiepine to help calm me down while reducing Mirt? Um no thanks Doc. One addiction is quite enough for me at the mo.  I have never spent so much on Doctors bills than during this time. Anyway back to cutting.. I ended up with a pile of little cut off pill ends, but hey it has to be done. Getting off this s*** was worth the inconvenience. I was sure I'd end up in a psych ward or dead well before getting off this garbage. But trusting that Mirt was causing me pain and not wanting to permanently feel like a vegetable spurred me on.
As for the insomnia (which started basically overnight after I had bad news about my business. 2-3 hours of broken sleep a night feeling the minutes crawl by or 5 hours on a good night) I first went through 3 doctors who gave me assorted sleeping pills: Phenergan, Melatonin, Zopiclones. Not good long term solutions. My lack of sleep gave me paranoia and anxiety so in desperation I tried Mirtazapine. Immediately I felt the dread but it gave me hours more sleep- in the good stretches that is. Fast forward until I took the step to get off Mirt. They have a sleep clinic at my health centre which I first thought was a joke but actually probably saved me.There I wrote down my (lack of) sleeping patterns and here is what they suggested that helped me to sleep: blackout curtains, earplugs, eye mask, no tea/coffee only chamomile tea with milk,no screens past 7pm, blue light filter on phone, blue light blocking glasses, sleep hygiene, Melatonin tablets, 150 mg magnesium tablets before bed, also cheese and / or drinking chocolate made with hot milk before bed for the tryptophan which keeps you asleep for longer. In no way did this work suddenly. It's only a gradual process where you need a higher faith that it will all work out. sometimes you can't see improvements at all, but as sure as day follows night they will come. Its good to keep a diary saying how many hours sleep you had, how your mood is on a scale of 10 and trigger issues/thoughts that may be affecting your mood. Then you have concrete proof you are improving over time or not. Gradually your sick days from work get less and less. I am forgetting the single biggest thing to help give you peace and make you relax: a belief in a better future for yourself. So try counselling, make plans to get out of any rut and brainstorm like crazy in your good times. The past is the past so make a new future for yourself now.
When I needed hope I wanted to know how long had people been off Mirt (but couldn't find many examples) and what are their experiences once off it- never more than a few months off and usually they were not having a great time. So I hope this convinces someone there is hope eventually. Thanks

"Dear Patients,
i came out of a really dark tunnel. During my withdrawal and afterwards, i used to spend days and nights on this forum, in search for help & hope. Today i feel absolutely great and i would like to share my experience with you, so that you might find some hope & help for yourself !
I had the worst time of my life, but i came back!
Started mirtazapine due a protracted and severe insomnia, anxiety and depression.
MZ worked great for sleep for a while due to its sedation, which shuts down your racing mind when going to sleep. However the body gets used to it and you won't feel the sedation at some point and might go back to square. This was the case for me. MZ never helped with depression and i even think it made it worse. It helped somewhat with anxiety. During the time, where it worked for sleep i would wake up feeling completely depressed & hopeless.
I started tapering during a period where i felt a bit better and it went kind of ok. I did have some clear withdrawal effects but it was bearable. What was unbearable was the continued/increased insomnia and hopelessness. I felt like i would never sleep or be happy again. I did a slow taper going from 15-7.5-3.75-2 and then 0.2 decrements every 2 weeks. I felt crap throughout, but i can't tell you to what extent it was withdrawal or underlying condition.
During the taper and when i jumped off, i felt increasingly crap, with new worrisome bad symptoms showing up. I tried so many natural remedies and medications, nothing really worked (tried most of them for not too long though). But i wouldn't give up. I started a new medication and finally managed a breakthrough in overcoming certain mental barriers, which clearly led to my problems over time. I started gradually recovering and after a few months a felt absolutely great. I can now sleep my 6-8hrs without interruption, feel rested and motivated for the day when i get up. I thought i would never sleep properly again... it feels like a godsend.
Hope i can give you some hope with this.
Never give up.

"I've been taking Mirt for 18 months, prescribed for an episode of primary insomnia where I didn't sleep at all for nearly a week. It was a life saver at that point. I've been doing a slow taper pretty much ever since (10% a month) but due to bumps in the road with my sleep have somehow ended up on a higher dose than I started (currently on about 26mg of the liquid).
Over the last 6 months I have started getting a type of insomnia that I've never had in my whole life - where I go to sleep fine but wake up at about midnight or 1am and can't get back to sleep at all. I have this odd feeling that the Mirt might at least be contributing to this new problem. I am falling asleep on the sofa at 9pm (before I've even taken the Mirt) - it's literally impossible to keep myself awake, even when I sit up, like being drugged. I push it as much as I can then go to bed about 10:30pm, take the Mirt and go to sleep straight away. But then wake up at midnight or 1am and don't get back to sleep. It feels as though my body isn't somehow going through it's natural sleep cycle and I'm wondering if the Mirt is somehow contributing to this. Has anyone experienced anything like this or heard of it? It didn't happen for the first 12 months that I took it, it's just developed over the last 6 months or so. xx

It is often disruptive. I can basically only take 3.75mg to not feel tired the next day. I at least want to take 7.5mg. Are there ways that anyone has has success managing drowsiness on this medication? Please share.

"I just started taking Remeron/Mirtazapine for anxiety 12 days ago. My Dr said it also had a sedating effect so I was excited to try it. I slept good the first two nights then my sleep turned restless, I felt like I was tossing and turning all night. The last couple of nights have been so bad that I don't feel like I sleep at all. It feels like I am stuck between being awake and asleep all night. When I do sleep, I have crazy dreams that make me feel like I am awake. I wake up all night long. I have tried to find similar reviews but have not seen any. What is going on? Is it the histamine agent?
I am taking 7.5mg - my Dr wanted me to increase to 15mg. The one day I did increase, I was dizzy the whole next day. Can I stop taking this medication? I do not want to stay on it too long and face some of the horrible taper and withdrawals that i read about.

"So, I'm one of the people who has piled on all the weight with Mirtazapine. I've been on 30mg for a couple of years now and I'm just getting bigger and bigger and bigger! But I've read conflicting reports about increasing vs decreasing the dose. Some say that increasing the dose will help combat the weight gain and others say decreasing the dose will do this. (This seems the more logical one to me!)
Obviously I plan to talk to my GP about it (although it might be hard getting an appointment anytime soon with all the Covid19 goings-on), but I was just wondering if any of you had any insights?

"Thank you for post. Its encouraging. i had M 15mg 30mg 45mg for about one year and half for panic attack. Recently, my treatment with my phycologist works well, so i asked my doc to taper down M. i was on 30mg for about 2 months and then 15mg for another two months. Three weeks ago, i stopped the medication. Since my doc did not tell me at all about possible withdrawal symptoms, at the beginning, i had diarrhea for two days and my anxiety was high without knowing the reason. One week later, i have started waking up midnight with short breath and nausea, while anxiety is still high. I then asked my doc and he told me it is withdrawal symptom and it might last for a month. Now, I am not on any meds. I dont fearful of high anxiety level and decide to fight it when it comes. Im positive and hope that the symptoms are gone asap. The positive side is that my weight has started to drop since i am not eager for food the same way as how i was during taking M. In addition, my triglycerides is dropping down from high, and my sex drive is back.

"Hey everyone,
I was on 7,5 mg of Mirtazapine for almost two months now. My doctor suggested a week ago that I try going to 15 mg and I did that for three days but I noticed I was not doing good on 15 mg so I talked to my doctor again and I'm on 7,5 mg again. I'm having some issues like being anxious and a bit shaky so I went online to see if that was related to my decreasing the dose after increasing it for three days and I was reading what people wrote and I feel really scared of this drug now. As I said I'm on 7,5 mg again and after four days it would be 2 months since I started taking the drug. My concern is how do I come off it now with my situation? I was considering staying on 7,5 mg for two weeks and then cut it off to 3,75 mg for another two weeks and then stop, would that be a viable solution? also can you please tell me how long would the withdrawal symptoms last?
Thank you guys in advance. I would really appreciate every advice because I'm scared of this drug as hell

"I have suffered from suicidal depression for 15 years. And anxiety for 5 years
18 years ago my dad died suddenly. 3 year's later my youngest brother died of cancer six months after being diagnosed.
My brothers doctor came to my sister's house to fill out the death certificate. Because we were caring for him there . And we were upset obviously upset
so he gave us a prescription each before he left. For antidepressants now i had never been depressed didn't even know anything about antidepressants
And for the next ten years i was okay or so i thought.
What i didn't realise is that a lot of things that I suffered from or had were probably due to the medication i was on and am still on but at much lower doses and am reducing slowly.
Over the years my antidepressants were changed. But it was never suggested that I should come off of them or reduce them ever.
Five years ago I was really ill with severe panic attacks and suicidal depression and the doctor decided again that I would have to have my antidepressant changed. So she took me off of my dosulpin 90 and put me on mirtazapine 45mg and it took me 2yrs to get over that cut. Not knowing what was wrong with me, not realising that I was having withdrawal symptoms i kept going to the doctors and she kept changing my meds
So the last five years have been hell how i am still here today i do not know. I have learnt so much from this sight .I've spent almost a year reading peoples post and deciding weather or not to join.
And I've spent so much time trying to find something to help me so as would not have to spend the rest of my life taking antidepressants, which give me anxiety and don't help my depression much either.
And what I've found is niacin. It gets rid of anxiety gives me support when I make a cut in my meds, and makes me feel normal . You can read up about it online everywhere
It's amazing and has given me back my life . You have to buy the niacin that makes you flush. And start on the lowest dose possible and increase gradually. Once you flush you can stay at that dose .Don't be afraid of the flush.
The feeling of peace and calm that you get after is amazing and no anxiety. Read about it and educate yourself and then you may want to try it. It is not harmful its a b vitamin b3 actually . It's give to people by the hospitals and doctors and it's very successful for people that suffer from schizophrenia

"So I've been on Mirtazapine for almost 2 years now. I've always been curvy, and when I started I was about 65kg (I'm 5'7). I noticed the increased appetite for the first few months but it went away, and I managed to eat basically the same. I thought I was one of those people to not gain weight from it, but after about 8 months on 30mg I noticed a massive weight gain. After a year ans a half, I put on almost 25kg, despite not changing my eating habits. I cut down to 15mg, but I am still way overweight now. I'm convinced that it slows down your metabolism, because my diet has been unchanged (if anything, I'm eating less than I was before).
I don't want to stop taking Mirtazapine, as it has greatly helped my sleep and panic attacks. It's helped me a lot, yet I can't help but hate being this heavy. It's really taking a toll on my self confidence. Is it possible to lose some weight while staying on this medication? Has anyone been able to do that? I've downloaded myfitnesspal and I plan on exercising and counting calories and trying to be more disciplined and strict with myself. I started yesterday, and I was surprised to see that the calories creep in here and there without me thinking about it. I'm hoping this will work, -: I really don't want to stop taking Mirtazapine. I don't want to have to choose between good mental health OR healthy weight, I'd love to have both! Please let me know if you have any advice or experience with this.

"I've been on 15mg Mirtazapine for nearly a year now and after I was bumped up to 30mg due to work related stress I have decided to reduce my dose as I felt strange on the 30mg. I began tapering down to 22.5mg for about two weeks and then jumped down to 15mg again, as I wasn't feeling too bad after the couple of weeks on 22.5mg.
However, now I have just been feeling absolutely horrible. I don't feel like myself at all and I don't seem to be feeling any kind of emotion or passion for anything. I usually have to nap and sleep a lot throughout the day just to calm my brain down from racing thoughts. Another symptom I seem to have been experiencing is overstimulation, where loud noises and bright lights seem to just take it out of me. I can't even really watch intense TV shows anymore as when I do it feels like my brain is about to overload; I feel like this could be a symptom of anxiety but it's very hard to describe.
Every day I feel a little bit better but it's hard to fight through when it feels like there is no end in sight. I can't imagine what it must feel like for those coming off of it completely. I just want to feel like myself again.
Do these symptoms resonate with anyone and does anyone have any advice on how to start feeling like themselves again when experiencing these severe withdrawal symptoms ?

(This started right after a day procedure where they used Midazolam.) The episodes gradually softened to a few seconds at a time (4/5 times daily) now where i find myself not recognising what I'm looking at (its called Jemais vu, opposite of dejavu). I've tried unsuccessfully to wean myself off, obviously too quickly! if I didn't think these episodes were connected I'd continue taking the mirtazapine. The insomnia is crippling. Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

"Hi,
I switched from 40mg Citalopram to 15mg mirtazapine just before Christmas as I was still having bad insomnia and my dr felt that I'd sleep well on it. Within a few days of starting it I began getting really bad acid reflux and waking up in the night choking which then made me scared to go back to sleep. I could feel the acid even during the day as I moved. I spoke to my dr who was adamant that mirtazapine doesn't cause acid reflux but she prescribed a course of omeprezole which did stop it. Since finishing the course its started badly again and my new dr wants me to increase the mirtazapine to 30mg. Has anyone else experienced acid reflux with it? I have a fairly healthy diet but have put on about a stone since starting the mirtazapine so I am overweight which i know is probably contributing to the reflux. I don't feel like myself on the mirtazapine and do wonder if i should come off of it rather than increasing it.

"Rated R
Had the procedure about 6 mos. ago. It all stopped working after a month. Retired a few months ago so I don't care about a little few droplets. Have to go NOW and at least 3-4 times a night.
I WILL NEVER GO BACK AND LET THEM SHOVE THAT PROBE UP MY urethra. They said it had anesthetic smeared on it to relieve any ""discomfort"". Bull, it hurt like hell. So why would I go and purposely have this procedure to see what went wrong? So that's one thing. Hell they got this thing up my dick and tells me to relax. That's like seeing the oxygen masks drop down in an air plane and the flight attendant says to breath ""normally""!
I was out for the procedure, but when I woke up I experienced the most horrific pain I've EVER had. Blood spurting out of my penis. Screaming burning pain. Asked the nurse for something for pain. They replied, ""We have some Tylenol""? Dr. never came to see me.
The cost for that procedure was $25,000! My daughter got me home just in time into the bathroom to pee and get a diaper on and take 4 - 200mg of ibuprofin. So if those metal bridges are all pulled out and mushed up I'll wait till the sepsis sets in and then have a better Dr. next time to take em out. I don't recommend urolift. There are other options now.

"I'm 5 weeks into starting 7.5mg of mirtazapine. My doc prescribed me it for sleep, eating, depression, and anxiety/panic.
I don't need to begin with the over-eating as most of you are probably familiar with that. It worked for my sleep for a week, now I'm back to staying up until 6 am. I take it at 9pm sharp. All it does is make me feel like I was hit by a truck all day the next day, like I'm dragging my body through tar, and I am so foggy I'm nervous to drive. I can't get out of bed when the alarm goes off, but I can't sleep. It has done nothing for the social anxiety which I care most about, but he told me to hang in there for the effects to work. I cant find any evidence that it's more beneficial for social anxiety than an SSRI. I have eye pain all the time, like my sockets are sore every time I move my eyes and they are puffy but that could be water retention. My face is so puffy I don't look like the person I was before it, and since starting the med I have constant sinus pain and pressure, obviously around the eyes in particular and have to clear my throat in the mornings. It feels dry.
I am nervous because I have to move for work in 10 days. I should have been adamant about going off the med sooner but I wanted to give it a chance, for the panic in particular. Everyday has gotten worse, especially the sedation (that doesn't cure the insomnia). I feel like a zombie. If I bring this up with my doc would 10 days be enough time to ween off considering I'm only on 7.5? I got so frustrated about all of this today, I am aware of how ""out of it I am"" and just started uncontrollably crying.

"Hi
I was on Citalopram 20mg for three weeks but found the side effects absolutely awful and couldn't sleep. My doctor said stop them for two days then start Mirtazapine 15mg at night. I actually waited three days before starting the Mirtazapine.
Have been on it for six days now. Am sleeping well but still having side effects such as pins and needles in feet, random aches in body, feeling very hot (not sweaty) and uncomfortable stomach, though not burning like on the Citalopram.
Can anyone relate to this? Is it Citalopram withdrawal or Mirtazapine start up do you think? I really don't want to be on any medication but my family seem to think it will help my health anxiety.
Thanks for reading.

"I was given mirtazapine by the doctor a few weeks ago for severe depression caused by the sudden death of my husband at a young age last year , however after reading about the horrible side effects I have been scared to start it...until last night ( I had horrific side effects while taking sertraline previously including suicidal thoughts ) anyway After feeling completely desperate with a total of around 4 hrs sleep over 4 nights I resorted to trying the mirtazapine.
It certainly did give me the much needed sleep, I slept solidly for around 6 1/2 hrs which did feel amazing! it would've been longer i think if my daughter hadnt got up at that time.
However, there are a few things that concern me and have left me wondering whether i should take it again....
i could feel the effects of the pill working within just a few minutes of taking it! it was like i had literally been knocked out i think if it wasnt as strong as it is i wouldve been in an extreme panic, but it suppressed that .. i felt almost paralysed , i couldnt move my arms, legs or head without trying so hard to rouse myself and really concentrating and then i could only manage a little. as well as this my left leg kept on twitching quite violently, kicking out , couldnt control it. although
this must have only lasted a very short while before i went fully under and slept .
then on waking this morning my head felt almost manic , my body was weak and i could barely move but my mind was in overdrive , so many thoughts, random disorganised thoughts racing . words just popping into my head but my body just didnt match . is all this normal? i have had this mind racing many times before but not on meds and nowhere near as intrusive .
the exreme fatigue wore off mid afternoon to me feeling ALMOST "" normal"" , but now i find i am very irritable and snappy and cant stand the sound of my daughter chewing next to me at all , makes me feel rage ! which is new for me.
also, what about alcohol ? i do like a drink , usually a glass of wine in evenings and the thought of having a dry christmas is not great .
i'm thinking of skipping the dose for two nights so i can have some drinks but then what effect will that have on me? so i'm unsure about whether to stop now after one pill while i can easily or carry on and try it for longer . the experience last night with the leg movements and paralysis has frightened me .
i apologise this is so long .I'm just after some input from others who have experience on this medication .
thanks

"I went on Mirtazapine 15mg in December 2013, prior to that I was on 7.5mg for 8 months. I took it for anxiety after I was attacked by my brother in 2012. It helped me eat and sleep again, and it did help me start getting back outside after a long time agoraphobic and anxious. 
I remember I always felt tired on it but I think I just got used to it but some days I felt hungover but managed to carry on with no great difficulty. Then in spring 2015 I started feeling tired all day to the point I just wanted to lie down all day and slowly my agoraphobia crept back in. 
In the winter of 2015 I had some kind of anxiety breakdown, my son was suicidal due to bullying, my daughter was unwell and in hospital and I was having to juggle it all myself. My husband works full time and his boss wouldn't allow him any time off. During this time my fatigue worsened and with it my anxiety too. 
All of last year I had crippling fatigue and spend most of the year lying on my bed feeling absolutely exhausted. I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid and put on thyroxine. My levels are now normal. Yet my fatigue this year so far is worse than last year.
Mornings are hell. I cannot function I feel so bad, and with 3 childen to get to school that's difficult, I remember I'd have the odd hangover feel morning early on taking Mirtazapine but this seems to have just got worse over the last 2 years and now I feel worse than ever. 
I took 15mg late Saturday night, about midnight as I forgot to take it earlier. I usually take it about 10pm. On Sunday morning it was 9am and i still couldn't open my eyes, I had to force them open and force myself out of bed. I am usually up at 7am even when feeling tired.. I spent the whole day in a drugged up state, feeling foggy headed, woozy/dizzy headed, sickly feelings and just generally drained. This continued into Monday too. So Monday night I took just half a dose as I was desperate for some relief and yesterday although still chronically fatigued all day I didn't feel as bad. I called Sunday and Monday a crash, all of last year I had random crash days where I'd have to lie in bed as I felt the most crippling fatigue. 
Last night I went back up to the 15mg after just 1 night taking a half dose, and wham today I am back feeling the worst crippling fatigue. My head feels so heavy, woozy, dizzy and I can barely keep my damn eyes open. This triggers my anxiety. I am terriified there is something serious wrong with me. I have had so many tests and my GP can't find anything other than the thyroid but I am sure this isn't from that. I told him about the mirtazapine and how I felt better the night I took half a dose and he is now concerned mirtazapine suddenly after 2 years has caused chronic fatigue and he wants me to come down to half a dose for a while and see how I feel, then work towards weaning off it. I am happy to do that, but I am scared but he wants me to just take 7.5mg not wean slowly. I told him I am too scared to do that but he said 15 to half a dose shouldn't cause any issues, I told him I'd read it was a nasty drug to come off and he said he hasnt' had any patients complaining weaning off. 
He won't prescribe the liquid. I take Actavis 15mg hard tablets. 
Can anyone relate to this type of chronic fatigue?  i have had 2 years of hell feeling llike this, I have been a pin cushio having test after test for nothing to be found. Recently all he found were my neutrophils were a litlte low and lymphocytes high, I panicked I had cancer or something but he assured me it won't be why I feel so tired. I just can't carry on feeling this bad, I want my energy back, I want to enjoy the last few years of my children being children, I do not want to be this drugged up fatigued mess who some evenings even struggles to cook dinner and has to order a takeaway. It's turned me into a recluse this last year and I have missed out on so many things, my agoraphobia has returned worse than before and my GP has to come to my house but I even find that hard as I have now awful social anxiety. I feel a complete mess. This drug helped me early on after I was attacked but now I feel no benefit of taking it other than yes when I think how anxious I was before I took it I am now so calm but I am sure it's because I am too tired to think, let alone panic. It isn't helping this last year of anxiety about my health or the agoraphobia and it won't because I am crippled by fatigue.
I feel a drugged up mess today, my whole body feels heavy and my head is so fatigued. Is this something mirtazapine could cause? I want off this awful drug if it is :-( My friend says it can't suddenly after 18 months start causing chronic disabling fatigue. 
Sorry this got long.
Julie

"Hi all, I was advised by gp to taper off my 15mg mirt by skipping doses, however after a little over a week of doing this the symptoms were too strong to continue. taking onboard advice from support groups I realise i need to taper much more slowly! for the last couple of days ive reinstated back to my normal 15mg daily and will let that settle before attempting a much slower taper down the line. I have a couple of manageable symptoms but my biggest one I’m struggling with in increased anxiety and feeling permanently on edge! Do you think that this will settle soon? Many Thanks

"Hello everyone,
I'm looking for some advise or guidance.
I've had lots of experience with antidepressants growing up and I have a little bit of a fear with something going wrong with medications as I would get sick with them right away for most.
I started on 7.5mg of Mirtazapine for two weeks, doctor wanted me to go on 15mg for two weeks, which I did and I felt alot better. He wanted me to go to 22.5mg for two weeks but I only did for a couple of days before jumping to 30mg. I've been on 30mg for 3 ngihts so far and I feel so anxious, so down, so worried about everything and I feel as though there is something wrong with my relationship while there is not and I just want to cry.
Should I go back down to 15mg? Should I push through 30mg? I just want to feel happy and normal. My sleep is wondering and the weight gain is wonderful because I was severly under wight with no appetite.
Any in sight would help so so much!!

"Can someone who runs the nice Facebook mirt group please let me know what it is called. I used to be a member 2 years ago but left Facebook. I wanted to try and taper off mirr again after an unsuccessful try 2 years ago that triggered anxiety that Ive just come through but i want off this drug as its been almost 7 years i have taken it and its caused my health to deteriorate badly and my mental state. I know people may say but look how bad your anxiety went when you slowly tappered and yea that is true it got worse but i think that was purely withdrawal and that it was my underlying anxiety state coming through again because honestly my anxiety was never as bad as it has been these 2 years after i tried to withdraw and now i have depression too so i want off as it isn't helping wither condition.
I was on 15mg. i got down to 11.5 when the anixety hit hard with severe panic attacks that led to 12 months of horrendous anxiety and panic. That was all of 2018. I am now in a bit of a better place hut my anxiety has never gone down to where it was prior to withdrawal. but i no longer have 12 hour panic attacks, every single day like i had in 2018. Now it is more like general anxiety every day. Anyway, I want to try again even slower. I was withdrawing by 0.5mg every 2-3 weeks so i plan to go slower. I went back up to 13.7 by mid 2018 to see if it helped from the 11.5 I got down to, doing 0.25mg increases that year and i have stayed on that dose since.
I would love to join that group again if anyone can point me in their direction please.

"Hi All
A little history
I have suffered anxiety and depression previously.
about 4 years ago, i was prescribed venlafaxine 75 mg (i think), after 1 day on sertraline, induction was horrible (Restless and trouble sleeping and other typical side effects) and on going side effects weren't great . I was on them for about 8 months and withdraw by tapering slowly.
About 2 years ago i went on to Citalopram for about 8 months 15 mg. I suffered with pretty bad side effects for the first 3 months and come off again by tapering.
I have been on mirtazapine for 12 weeks due to depression , anxiety and not sleeping. The depression and anxiety started again mainly from work stress, but then i get anxiety from things in my past which come around again when the anxiety and depression start again.
I realise that i am going to have to be on these for quite a bit longer this time.
I went on mirtazapine due to them being good for sleep and the length of side effects from citalopram the last time. I went on cit the last time due to the venlafaxine start up side effects which were horrid.
I think that I am pretty sensitive to AD side effects.
My anxiety increased when i first went on them, 15 mg, for a couple of weeks and then seemed to get better, but not resolved. After about 5 weeks i increased to 22.5 as the anxiety was still there and mood was not improved. I sleep ok and definitely get to sleep ok ( about 10pm) but am now waking at about 5 am and am taking longer to get to sleep. I don't feel too groggy, but don't feel great during the day but have no appetite and anxiety is increasing again.
I am wondering what to do.
Is it worth increasing to 30mg , or is it likely that anxiety will increase further with a higher dose.
Should I decrease back to 15 mg but will that not be enough to beat the anxiety and increase mood .
Should I change to something else , maybe back to citalopram as it seemed to work last time but the side effects were pretty bad for 12 - 13 weeks, ( diarrhea and restlessness feeling foggy and some difficulty sleeping, i think i felt pretty fluey for a while too) I'm not sure i want to go back to that but realise that i may not have a choice.
The curent dose of Mirtazapine 22.5mg isnt doing what i want it to and am still anxious ( i am smoking a lot more cigarettes at the moment) .
Will i have to come off Mirt for a while before switching to something else or can a cross taper be done. Is that likely to horrid also.
I want to get myself settled and sorted out on something that I could take for a bit longer.
Thanks in advance for any guidance or thoughts.

"I've not updated my experience in months, and in truth, I didnt even want to think about what they did to me.
After a good start, and everything going well, mirt took its toll and I ended up in A&E. Mirt gave me a swollen gallbladded (dangerously so) and this explained the stmach bloating.
My temper was terrible, I've never been a violent person, but turned into one...and I a mean BAD. Physically violent.
After a lot of tests at the hosp and they saw how swollen my gallbladder was, they took me off th tablets immediately and I had to go cold turkey for a month to clear this crap out of my system. I'm glad to say, all is well no, no adverse effects to my gall bladder and my temper is back to my normal passive self.
Stay clear of this horrible medicine ! Thats all I can say.

"Hi I was put on mirtazapine after a 15 year skint on trazadone which stopped working and made me become very restful at nite and not able to sleep more then one hour in the nite, so went to docs in tears and was put on mirtazapine around November 2016, 15mg to start with, then told to go up to 30mg, sleep is fantastic now, and seem to sleep well, but started to feel irritated at nite and unable to sleep till early hours of the morin, so I went down to 15 mg and all seem ok with sleep, but my mood as dropped really low, and just feel like crying, just wondering if I need to grit my teeth and go back up to 30 mg to see if my symptoms get better, not sure what's best stick to 15 mg or go bk up to 30 mg and see if the sleep gets better, some nites I take 15 mg and some nites 30 mg if I know I will fall asleep quick, just want to stick to one or the other, or maybe these tablets just don't work for me, any one out there feel the same...

"Hi all,
I have been on Mirtazapine 15mg for roughly 5 months. I was put on mirt to stop my anxiety before I went to sleep. I was getting plenty of sleep on these things but I was feeling emotionally numb. 
Towards the end of my prescription I wanted to go cold turkey and just get off of them and initially I was absolutely fine. I started to notice symtoms of irritable bowels and a loss of appetite. Eventually I felt like I was hit in the face with depression. 
I sleep just fine now but as soon as I wake up I get filled with anxiety, dread and general depression. I have lost nearly all motivation for work and being alone makes me anxious.
I can get my head level after a period of time and after some tears but then my hardwork feels like it comes undone and I am overwhelmed with anxiety/depression and it hits me in waves. I can be really happy one minute and then very depressed the next.
I don't want to go back onto any anti depressants or anything. I would say that my anxiety before taking these tablets was mild but now it is. 
I know that we all experience withdrawal differently but I guess what I am looking for is some encouragement that I will eventually feel normal again. I have been feeling like this for nearly a week now and it is killing me. It has been about 5/6 weeks sine I took Mirtazapine. Has anyone succesfullly come off Mirtazapine cold turkey?
Thanks!

"I took Mirtazapine 15mg for 6 weeks. Felt awful on it - decided to come off. Doc said as low dose would be ok to just stop. Yep! Stupidly I did this & now in 9 th week off pure hell. The withdrawal hit almost immediately. Have experienced every nasty WD symtom just about with chronic insomnia being a constant.....I have had absolute minimum of natural sleep in all thus time.
Forced to resort every 3 days or so a Benzo for a little respite.
I feel trapped, very 'wrong' & unwell & that I'm just shutting down altogether.
Yes I've tried & tried to get help.
Everywhere I can think of.
Had a lot of checks done. Most health professionals I've seen dont even acknowledge WD symptoms
Will this nightmare ever end?
How can I get some sleep without going onto another drug (dont want this) or reinstating (dont want this either & maybe too late now?)
Can anyone relate?
If so , how are you coping /how did you get through?
At advice / info appreciated

"Hi, fellow sufferers of anxiety and depression, like a lot of you i want rid of these drugs as these and others seem to have taken from my wellbeing, anyway have tapered off SSRI's past few weeks down from 100mg, now down from Mirtz 15 to 3.75 then taper again. But it seems I am the only one where Mirtz did not help my sleep in fact it had the opposite effect with more insomnia. I just figured that had been the common effect of SSRI/s. Dr said stay on Mirtz 15mg as that will make your sleep better it didnt and hasn't. Also am I the only one that suffered weight loss not gain? I see most people complain about feeling sleepy and whacking on the weight, myself, the opposite, loss of weight and insomina, waking up every 2 hours on the dot at night. Im trying a hypnotherapist tmw for sleep. I have a good diet and excersie regime. Im trying to taper gradually. I also realise that I have only been on them a few months but at each drop have felt the side effects especially the ones i mentioned, but shaking and feeling anxious during the day for no reason. Oh the other thing a super dry mouth especially in the morning that i thought would leave after the SSRI but remains with Mirtz, can hardly swallow untill i get some water. Thanks for having this site it gives comfort and support to all, and we all need that. It shows everyone is different ...

She said I could but first I'd have to gradually come off mirt so she told me to take 30mg for 7 days then 15mg for 7 days. Ive read that it usually takes months to come off them from the highest dose. I'm now experiencing an upset tummy & I dont know whether or not its withdrawals.

"Hello,
Back story of mine, was borned normal, didn't have any mental issues or social problems. 8 weeks ago I came in contact with an illegal substance(MDMA) and took half a dose of it. Nothing in particular happenned but after 2 weeks I again had the misfortune to use it but this time due to alcohol I wasn't thinking straight and abused it(took 1 pill and a quarter or a half). So after 1 day I had an episode of insomnia which lasted for 2 days and decided to try natural things, I was getting more and more sleep but felt depressed,anxious,had panic attacks,night sweats for a period of time, problems concentrating, diarrhea, constipation, wasn't feeling energized,couldn't do any sports.
I decided to go to a psychiatrist for a temporary help. She prescribed me Mirt 15 mg to take for 6 days and if the sleep problems isn't solved to ramp it to 30 mg. I am on day 12 and still taking 15 mg which definitely helps me sleep. However I know that the sleep I get ain't natural and don't want to take this med for long periods of time to have withdrawl symptoms when I stop it.
I'd like to hear suggestions how to taper it at this dosage for this short period of time I have been taking it

I was started on 15mg for anxiety which worked great for sbout 5 weeks and then I started to feel really down? My gp increased to 30mg and i started to feel really depressed and anxious, more so than before but thought it was just taking time to work, it didn't so i reduced back to 15mg and then the fireworks started, bad thoughts, shaking, sweating and extreme nausea. I am coming off them and now on 7.5mg for another week, then 3.75 and off! I feel do much better and although i'm feeling a bit rough those bad thouhts and extreme anxiety have left me, it was the mirtazapine, so obvious now, please don't mess about with this drug, it either works or it doesn't, approach with caution, please

"I've been taking Mirt for about 15 months, initially on 15mg. It literally saved my life at a very dark time - I suffer from extreme episodic bouts of insomnia that then cause panic attacks and crippling anxiety through sleep deprivation. At the time it was the only thing that worked for my sleep. I slowly tapered down over the last year to 3mg and then had a relapse and now after a summer filled with more and more episodes of insomnia for one reason or another (not to do with the meds) I'm now on 18mg. I've noticed over the last few weeks that Mirt is no longer having the sedating effect on me that it used to, and wondered if anyone else has experienced this. I'm fully aware that it's supposed to be more sedating at lower doses, but I can't seem to get down low enough on a slow taper without having something else happen in my life that causes insomnia and the subsequent crippling anxiety. I'm at a bit of a loss with what to do now - if it's not helping me during those episodic (but severe) nights of insomnia anymore I'm not really sure why I'm on it. Recently I've been having to rely on taking a small (2mg) dose of valium on the nights when it's really bad - again I'm fully aware of the risks with that and I'm only taking one or two 2mg tablets a month, if that. The last thing I need is a benzo addiction. Has anyone else experienced Mirt stop working for their sleep after a while?

"Hi all,
Apologies for the long post.
I guess I should give a quick run down. I’m a 31 year old male from Australia. I have been dealing with anxiety and depression for around 15 years now. I was managing for a good few years but I was using marijuana to cope. My use became out of control so I decided I needed to give it up as it was just putting a lid on everything. I went to a mental health clinic for support. I finally stopped smoking weed and left the clinic feeling some what positive.
I have been out of the clinic for around 1 and a half months roughly. Since being home I have become worse.
I thought my antidepressants at the time (lexapro) weren't helping me as well as they should so I suggested a medication change to my gp. My gp called my psychiatrist and as he was going on holidays he said she could handle the change of meds. I got switched over to mirtazapine 15mg at night. As the days went by I started feeling worse. I know these meds take time to work so I kept going with them in hope I would start feeling better. Since starting and the two week mark on mirtazapine I have irrational anger, noise sensitivity, increased negative thoughts, head tightness, poor memory and concentration and some dizziness and vision disturbance. I kept telling myself that things would level out soon but they haven't. By around the 4 week mark My thoughts have become totally negative, I barely want to speak or be around anyone but I am scared of being alone and I constantly think of suicide. I got my psychiatrist appointment pushed forward as this was all worrying me. I described this all to him and he believes I have borderline personality disorder, so he has taken me off mirtazapine and back to lexapro and added seroquel morning and night.
I have gone from at least having a little hope, making plans and doing things to not wanting to leave my bed and having constant feelings of hopelessness, despair and it's like my mind constantly thinks of suicide. I don't think I really want to commit suicide but it is now just always there. I also get what I would describe a burning sensation in random parts of my body.
Before the medication change I would let anxiety get the better of me but I started to learn to challenge it and not be as scared of it but this feels different to anything I have ever experienced so I don't believe this is just purley anxiety
I guess I am looking for clarification from others who have had a similar situation. Am I right in saying that the mirtazapine wasn't agreeing with me and all of these newer feelings and sensations should subside once the lexapro kicks back in? I was not as bad until the medication changed. I know a clinic cannot totally fix you but I do feel my home environment doesn't help me that much and maybe I should push to go back at least to see if this all levels out. It's quite distressing and worrying for me.
Thank you for reading and thank you in advance for any replies.

"I was prescribed mirtazapine early in the year. I only took it for about 9 weeks and decided to stop because it was making my depression worse and it was making me gain weight.
I've always been underweight but mirtazapine gave me a belly. There isn't a lot if fat (about 1 inch) but it's still too much for me and I hate it. As soon as I noticed I was gaining belly fat, I panicked and immediately cut my calories right down.
It's been 10 weeks since my last dose and this disgusting belly is showing no signs of leaving. I don't get it. I'm still eating no more than 900-1000 calories a day and it's still there. Do I have to eat even less than that?
I liked how I looked before these evil tablets ruined my body. It doesn't feel like I'll ever be happy with my body again and I'll never take mirtazapine again. I hate my body now and just wish I could go back to looking how I did before.

"Hello everyone, i've been lately having some pretty bad issues with mirtazapine. I will first do a small background story on my journey with the med.
So i first started taking this bed almost 2 years ago. My original does is 15 mg every night. When i discovered how bad antidepressant can be for health if taken for to long and then also discovered that coming off them was very hard, especially if you been taking them for too long, so i decided after taking them almost a month, i decided to come off, but then i discovered that it was not that easy so i went to a facebook group and they helped me and told me how to properly come off( which is by the liquid method) So since nov 2 of 2018 i started tapering and i'm right now at almost 2 years of tapering this medication ( I've been tapering as slow as i can) So this month, like maybe the 3th or 4th day of this month, i've been experiencing what i can say is some pretty bad symptoms.
Now, i gotta say that i did experience this but like one time and then it never came back till this month, were almost constant i've been experiencing this throughout the day or at night when i'm sleeping (whish wakes me up and is bad)
This is what i can remember that it happens to me Either at day time or night, this happens:
Sometimes it starts with a tremor(slight trembling) or a weird sensation on my neck, other times it start with feeling uneasy/dizzy or shivers through my body and sometimes it comes as like my head feels light and my ears get this weird sound and sometimes it comes without a warning. I start feeling faint, like fainting and my stomach feels numb and i start to feel like i cant breath and a very bad/ annoying feeling throughout my body that i need to start moving, then my feets and hands start to sweat, then i start to feel more often the feeling of fainting or as if something bad is gonna happen to me and it keep getting worse. My heart rates faster or slower(either ways) some weird feelings start to go up to my head, feeling numb or cramps or something very weird and the list goes on. I feel dizzy/ without balance , like i was gonna shot down complitely and this horrible thing can last hours or minutes and rarely seconds. I've been getting this more when i'm awake although lately is been happening when i'm sleeping and my eyesight has change because of it. Like if i had depersonalization or derealization , i get blurry vision, i sometimes see things too big or far away, also very dizzy and i start to see as if all happening was a nightmare and i feel like i'm not actually here or feel at all.
In other words, this symptoms are the worst and i can't seem to find a way to male then go away. I'm trying to eat healthy, drink water and exercise but because i've been lacking sleep because of those symptoms i feel super weak and fatigue. Can anyone relate and tell me a solution? i can't spend another year(which is the time left for me to fully come off this medication) feeling that way.

"Please do not share stories about how you've gained weight, as I already know most people do. Thanks
Long story short, I was on Mirtazapine from January to May. It worked wonderfully for my anxiety. My only complaints were fatigue and weight gain. I have felt miserable since stopping it. I am willing to put up with tiredness, but don't want to gain the weight that I've since lost back or more.
When I was tapering off, I was dieting and exercising and did start to lose weight even when I was still on it. And I was eating terribly when I was on it in the winter, obviously contributing to the gains.
What I want to know is has anyone been successful in managing their weight or losing weight while on Mirtazapine? I have very good willpower, but I have read Mirtazapine can cause you to gain weight despite what you eat, so that's my concern. However, like I said, when I was dieting and exercising I was losing weight. I just want to hear some experiences or reassurance to make me feel more secure before starting the medicine up again.

"Hi all
I thought I would post my experience of this drug and how I have stopped taking it.
I started mirt 3 years ago for severe GAD and a side of depression. I had previously been on Prozac, sertraline, and citalopram with minimal benefit. My GP switched me to mirt to help with my sleep as I was having issues. Strangely enough it never did anything for my sleep at all, I could take the tablet and still be awake hours later, and it didnt seem to help with my anxiety or depression. My GP was adamant that I keep taking it so I stayed on it. Started at 15mg and ended up at 45mg.
After a year or so I started to get very spaced out all of the time with really bad headaches and anxiety off the scale. I knew it wasn't working but persevered and kept taking it.
Around 6 months ago I weened from 45mg to 30mg for a month with no ill effects at all. I then dropped to 15mg a day for a month, again no side effects, and then 15mg every 2 days. Finally I dropped to 7.5mg for 10 days. Im now at 0mg for a week. Have had some anxiety that comes in waves, and it can be a tad overwhelming, but I want off this drug. I am convinced it has caused most of the issues with my health over the last 2 years as all of the doctors tests came back normal, I was even given a ct scan for my headaches they were so bad.
I am determined to come off, I have succesfully come off this drug before, but ended up going back on because of anxiety Wish I hadn't because I knew it wouldn't work.
Good luck to anyone doing the same, you will get there!

"I wanted to post this as I've read so much and searched so much for discussions on weight loss on mirtazapine. it's hard to find any good news stories on this and as the drug has been a life saver for me, I felt it was important to share. let's face it the horror stories, if you don't want to put on weight can be frightening..
There is no getting away from the fact that this drug will increase your appetite and I think most people that start this are in such bad place anyway, that like me you think sod it at least I feel better!! And gain weight. I have been on this now for 5 years and probably put on a stone in the first 6 months. I've kept that stone on while eating fairly healthy and was convinced it just would not shift, and after all, i had read so many posts saying it was impossible to lose weight anyway.. so i was happy to just not be gaining.. Recently I decided I'd had enough of my spare tyre and would come at this scientifically! Calories in Calories out! I'm using an app and logging everything and cooking my healthy meals from scratch..I'm also taking a brisk 30 minute walk every day and sometimes squeezing in two walks if I feel like it...Guess what?? I'm loosing weight..It's slow at 1 or 2lbs a week but I'm 9lb down and feeling great. Please do not fall into the trap of thinking it's impossible because it's just not true, and this drug can be a real god send to some..I've recently met someone who has started cycling and using the same App while on Mirtazapine and she's dropped a stone in 6 weeks! It's doable guys! And I hope this post helps some people. x

"Hi all, getting quite desperate now. can someone please give me some promising news. I started on mirt purely because of dramatic weight loss and no appetite last September.

"Hello all,
I really need some desperate help. I have included my history below
February - 2 Week on Citalopram
March - Started 15 mg mirtazapine as citalopram was not helping
April - Started Sertraline 50 mg as Mirtazapine was not as effective
June- Still on Sertraline 50 mg and stopped Mirtazapine based on Doctor Review
In the last 3-4 days I have been getting Hypnic Jerks just as I am about to fall asleep or just when i have fallen asleep. I am so scared and annoyed. I have never taken Anti deppressants but in February I was getting adrenaline surges just on sleep onset due to which doctor put me on antidepressants.
I am really upset and not sure why this is happening. I read somewhere that it could be Mirtazapine withdrawal. Any helps is so so much appreciated. Do these go?
I keep having them as i am about to sleep or just when i am sleeping in the first stage.

"Hello
I started taking Mirtazapine to help with my sleep and anxiety. I took 15 mg for two weeks then realised it was a bit strong for what I need it for. I stopped taking it two weeks ago. I've been off it for 2.5 weeks now. First few days was ok then I felt terrible for a couple of days with brain zaps etc... Then this subsided and I was starting to feel better but last few nights I have been shaking and not sleeping much.
I think I quite sensitive to this sort of medicine, but I didn't expect to feel this bad after only taking it for 2 weeks. I don't feel anxious really but just physically feel terrible.
Not sure what the best thing to do is?

"Hi, Ive just come off Mirtazapine (30mg) after 6 months use, following an acute episode of postnatal anxiety. I'm now off the medication with not a single withdrawl effect. Nothing. This was my schedule as discussed with my GP:
30mg x 6 months....then:
30mg/22.5mg alternating days for 2 weeks
22.5mg for 2 weeks
22.5mg/15mg alternating days for 2 weeks
15mg for 2 weeks
15mg/11.25mg alternating days for 2 weeks
11.25mg for 2 weeks
11.25mg/7.5mg alternating days for 2 weeks
7.5mg for 2 weeks
7.5mg/3.75mg alternating days for 2 weeks
3.75mg for 2 weeks
3.75mg/0mg alternating days for 2 weeks
3.75mg/0/0 (so a single dose every 3 days) for 2 weeks
then nothing.
I used 30mg tablets and a cutter to get down to 15mg, then 15mg tablets cut down to 3.75. It does involve cutting tablets into quarters for smaller doses, but this worked very well.
Thought Id post this are there are many horror stories online. This took a few months, but was gentle and easy and no side effects. Good luck xx

"Hi all - I'm guessing that most people who read this will still be on the Mirt, but just in case...
I've been doing a slow 10% taper off Mirt since I started taking it this time last year (the weight thing was never going to be ok for me). I initially tried to come off too quickly thinking it would be fine as I'd only been on it for 2 weeks, but gave myself horrific WD so accepted the slow taper.
I'm now down to 2.55mg or .15ml of the liquid I take. My question is, what dose is reasonable to jump off? The doctors will obviously say something which is way too high, but equally I don't really want to wait another 15 months to drop 0.1ml every time! It feels a bit excessive. I wondered if anyone had any experiences or suggestions?

"Hi all,
This wll be a brief record of my experience coming off Mirtazapine.
Writing it down might help me stay focused on my goal and I'll try and answer any questions for others along the way.
I've been on 15mg of Mirtazapine for 15 months now.
For the first 9 months it worked wonders for me. Instantly helped with my sleep and anaxity. I can remember telling my doctor how amazed I was with it! 
After 9 months I started feeling I was getting more and tired in the days. 
It was effecting my focus, concentration and memory. I was groggy in the morning till 10am and dozy in the afternoons from 3pm. I was feeling a bit out of control. Zombie like.
I had a decision to either up my dose to 30mg, as higher doses has less of a sedation effect. Or to try and come off it.
I decided in the long run, increasing it would only make coming off it harder in the end so I would TRY reducing it.
I started cutting a tablet into quarters with a craft knife, and taking 3/4 or 11.25mg a night.
For the first 2 night it didn't sleep well but felt about the same in the days so pushed on and it passed.
I always do my drops on a Friday night so I have the weekend to ride out the worst of it.
After 2 weeks I dropped again to 1/2 a tablet or 7.5mg.
This was a lot harder. I was in a really heave sleep until 9am the following days, woke up with a banging headache and couldn't do much all day.
It has been like this for the first 3 days on 7.5mg.
I am tempted to go back up but seeing as I have done 3 days now I will keep pushing on.
I know it is going to be a tough few weeks but I am going to do positive things to keep on top of it.
The classics. Eating well. Exercise. Vitamins and Omega-3.

"I have been an avid reader of people's experiences of this drug and wanted to share my own, positive (so far) experience. I'm starting to withdraw after 7 months on it and will post back about how it goes following what I think must be a 10% taper (link below).
I started 15mg of mirtazepine in october 2018 as I had become severely depressed due to a very difficult living situation. I had not eaten properly for three months, had been having trouble sleeping for most of that period and by the time these were prescribed I had been barely sleeping, getting out of bed or eating for two weeks. I refused anti depressants from my GP as he’s always given me SSRIs which have nasty side effects of reducing my appetite and increasing anxiety even further and I was too weak to endure awful side effects.
As I was so desperate I paid to see a private psychiatrist who prescribed mirtazepine. Once I received the prescription I spent about four days googling about it (during this time my living situation improved and I hoped I might not need them afterall) however I finally took the plunge after a very desperate day. I can say I didn't look back. Within 30 minutes I prepared and ate a small meal and the next day I was on three full meals a day plus snacks. I'd dropped about from over 60kg to about 52kg during the prior three months. My mood didn't take long to lift, in fact the suicidal thoughts I'd been having went within a few days. After two weeks I did a phased return to work which was successful although (unfortunately) I’ve had a lot of practice at going back to to work after these episodes so have learned how to pace myself. I can only work part time atm as I just don’t have the energy for more because of the Mirtazepine.
I've now been on the meds about 7 months and taken the decision to do a very slow taper off. As anyone who has looked up the withdrawal effects will know it's a very hard drug to get off because it makes you sleep! I decided to come off because I am getting frustrated with having lower energy levels than I would like and I have more than put back on the weight I lost.
After endless googling I have come up with the following strategies:
I found what I hope is an excellent taper schedule here http://www.citap.org.uk/SSRI-Tables.pdf and I’m in the very early stages of the taper. So far I’ve only had two days at 7.5mg. I did find it very hard to sleep on those days and am addressing this through using CBD oil. Last night despite being on 15mg I couldn’t sleep so I used the CBD oil which helped. Today I feel extremely relaxed and wonder if the effects of the oil are building up to create more calmness!
I also ordered omega 3 fish oil which is supposed to be very good for your brain as it heals from the illness and anti depressants.
I did buy HTP-5 which is supposed to help you sleep but it didn’t the first time I tried it and I prefer the CBD oil. So I am not using it at the moment.
As I get further into the withdrawal I will have more information about how it’s going and aim to come back to share it. I found so much information myself online and wanted to contribute, hence this post. At the moment I feel very positive because I think I’ve got some helpful strategies in place. I’m also working on taking things 1 day at a time and trying not to worry about what may lie ahead in terms of withdrawals; easier said than done!
Since writing this I have had another dose at 7.5mg and had more energy than usual the following day. There was some slight anxiety although only about 2/10 and nothing that affected my ability to go about my day as usual.

"I have been taking these for years, recently my GP said I could take Mirtazapine. There were no venalfaxine on the prescription and I assumed the Mirtazapine was replacing the Venalfaxine.
How wrong I was, 3 days later I had the weirdest body movements, my head was forced to the left and to the right, staying like that for minutes. Then both or one arm would be moved outwards and stuck. My mouth would open and be stuck, my right eyelid would close and again be stuck like that. Then I got weird sensations from my shoulders down my forearm, again stuck for minutes. It was as if I could feel my blood forcing me to do it. There were more weird sensations, memory loss, very scary.
Has anyone else had such a bad reaction? It was terrifying. I spent 2 years of shear hell coming off diazapam the panic attacks were so bad I paid to see a private clinical psychologist twice a week. He could do nothing.
Eventually my GP put me back on 6 x2mgs of diazapam a day. I's still taking them but they had no effect on the venalfaxine withdrawal.
Please could someone tell me if they have had similar withdrawal symptoms on stopping Venalfaxine dead. It felt like satan was at work in my body.
I'm still so shaken up.
I really do need help.
My GP sent me for a brain scan, all my vitals were normal too. The hospital witnessed my withdrawal symptoms. They had never seen anything like it before.

"hi there,
i started on mirtazapine 15mg about 6 weeks ago mainly for anxiety but with some low mood. I felt the benefits of the 15mg almost immediately and the dose was increased to 30mg (who knows why?!) Subsequently my anxiety has worsened - im switching back to 15mg tonight, under doctors orders....
Does anyone have experience of feeling more anxious on the higher dose? Any idea when the effects of the 30mg will be gone?
thanks all

"I know from my own experiences of this forum over the years that it's very difficult for others to give definitive advice as there are so many unique factors. But I am interested to hear what others would do if they were in the same situation as me.
I suffer from acute episodes of insomnia which then cause horrific anxiety attacks, which then cause insomnia. When it happens, it happens really bad and I had a huge crash last summer - the worst it's ever been. Outside of these ""episodes"" I am completely fine, for months and sometimes years - no anxiety, no insomnia. Last summer when the crash happened I was put on Mirtazapine and Escitalopram. It's no exaggeration to say that the Mirt literally saved my life. Yes it makes you put weight on which is horrible. Yes it (like all other antidepressants) is usually hard to come off. Yes there are start up side effects. But what it did for my sleep and to save my life made it worth it ten fold.
Because of the weight gain I have been tapering off it pretty much since I started taking it, at a 10% taper once a month - anything more than this gave me WD. I have managed to taper down to 2.7mg now. My Escitalporam dose is 5.5mg
I have been absolutely fine for months and months - I didn't even feel the Mirt was causing me to sleep anymore but I was still sleeping fine. Then on Tuesday this week an upsetting event occurred which triggered another spiral. I didn't sleep at all and then have had acute anxiety attacks in the early evening every day since. I whacked my Mirt dose back up to 5mg in order to sleep, and last night had to put it back up to 7.5mg. I have also had to take 2.5mg Diazepam the last two evenings at about 6pm because the anxiety attacks have been so bad. I am very aware that messing around with my Mirt dose is a bad idea - I need to stick to one thing. The conflict comes because I have worked so hard at tapering, it has taken so long, and I have recently lost 9 pounds from it, that it's soul destroying to just lose 6 months work in the space of two days. But I also know the most important thing is stabilizing myself.
Does anyone have any advice on what Mirt dose they would stick with, if they had been on 2.7mg and then suffered from another insomnia episode? Just to reiterate this episode was not caused by withdrawal, it was a life event that was nothing to do with my meds. Would you also increase your Escitalopram to deal with the anxiety or do you think it's better to do one thing at a time and use the Diazepam to help deal with that on a short term basis? (Once I sleep fine, I have no anxiety).

"I just wanted to post something to help / support all of the patients and partners out there.
My husband turned to anti depressants around 2 years ago, he started on citalopram.
To say it changed him was an understatement, he became completely withdrawn from me, would not talk, spent evening after evening on his phone, messaging other people, taking him further away from me, he was suddenly out every weekend until all hours, and he stopped talking to his parents who he had been previously really close to.
after 14 years together i lost my best friend, soulmate and partner.
I finally got him to talk when i said i was moving into the spare room, he said our marriage was in big trouble, had been for a couple of years apparently and that we had no future - wow, i felt like i had been hit by a bus.
He moved out around 6 months after he started the meds.
We have an 11 year old daughter who was my rock, and who blamed herself for what happened, our relationship is solid now as a result.
He came off the meds and eventually went on something else, i dont know what, but he couldn't let go and spent the next 12 months messaging me daily, he realised what he had lost and wanted to come back.
I said he needed to sort his head out as i could not put my daughter or myself through such heartache again.
After 18 months away, he is now on Mirtazapine, and he moved back in, i thought he was better and back to his old self.
I wish i could say that it was a happy ending, but i feel like history is repeating itself.
He has again become withdrawn from me, stopped talking, though cant go out because of Covid19 and spends his time on his phone again, and his moods are very up and down.
I don't know what the future holds for us, i am trying to cut him some slack, i know he is not well.
But for my own well being and that of my daughter, this forever changed man is not the person i met and fell in love with all of those years ago and i have to think of my own happiness.
So, if you are the patient, read this and think about how your partner could be suffering too, and if you are the partner, know that you are not to blame, and you are not alone.

"I've gained about 15lbs in about 2 months and no amount of any type of diet and exercise seems to stop it from putting on pounds. I'm someone who always struggled with gaining weight and I was curious why I can't seem to get mirtazapine to stop putting on weight, is it just increased appetite or could it be from water retention or slowed metabolism? I've been dieting quite a bit so I don't feel like increased appetite is the only thing causes issues.
Also, I've reached out to my psychiatrist about starting a different medication (I'm taking mirtazapine for anxiety and depression) and I was wondering if anyone has had any luck with a similar medication. So far, mirtazapine has worked the best for anxiety/depression as I have bad reactions to SSRIs. I'm sure my psychiatrist has alternatives but I would like to do some research on other meds before I speak with him.

"Hi I have recently been put on mitrazipine. I am on 15mg and for this week only I am to take it side by side with diazapam which I have been on for over 2 months,  the mitrazapine is to replace the diazapam, which I was on for anxiety and panic attacks. Since taking the mitrazapine I have been really tired, even after 10 or 11 hours sleep, suffering from splitting headaches, and just generally feeling spaced out and unable to take anything in. Of late I can't even recall some conversations that I have had with people.
The doctor put me on the mitrazapine as I was waking up shaky and I was struggling to sleep. I was also getting really emotional, bursting into tears all the time. 
Is it the fact that i am taking diazepam and mitrazapine making these symptoms worse, will it get better once I have stopped the diazepam? 
Also, after a recent blood test it was found that I had an imbalance of certain hormones. I am waiting on a scan but doctors think it could be cysts on my ovaries. When I asked if the imbalance of hormones could be the results of my anxiety and me being unable to sleep they were insistent it could not be. Im
 not even sure anti depressants is the right way to go. 
Anyone any ideas?
Thanks.

"Long story short I came off of Clonazepam 1.0 mg after around 3 months give or take and for anyone else who has came off benzodiazepines would attest please use them only as a last option.
My doctor put me in 50 mg of seroquel while going through the withdrawal phase to help with insomnia which he wants to increase which I'm not doing as I already take 22.5 mg of Mirtazapine. I've had horrible head pressure and headaches during my 17 days off of Clonazepam which I've attributed to withdrawal from it.
My question is for people who've done or know about Seroquel, is it possible that taking Seroquel is making my headaches or head pressure worse? I don't want to stay on this long term as I feel it will just be another medicine to work off of and was wondering if people had these issues with Seroquel as I don't know whether I'm coming or going coming off Clonazepam while using Seroquel as a stop gap..

"Hi - I'm new to the forum so bear with me.
I started on 15mg of Mirtazapine 3 weeks ago and I hate the stuff. I have recently been on sertraline citalopram and prozac. All 3 gave me horrible sides, ranging from balance issues and the shakes in my hands, so I stopped... but this medication is on another level.
I have recently split with my partner of 11 years and have lost everything. I still miss her and my pets, the house etc and have been finding things extremely difficult. I am back at my parents for the first time in 22 years and that is when my anxiety really kicked in and I developed the shakes in my hands whilst on prozac. I still get the shakes 3 months after the prozac and have seen the doc several times over this as I'm worried it is something more serious. My doc has told me i am suffering from extreme anxiety and have developed physical symptoms that I cant shift.
I have since developed a serious health anxiety, which has been increased tenfold by this horrible medication. My anxiety has been through the roof!!!
Since I have been on this medication my balance issues returned and I have felt unbelievably weak in my hands and my dexterity is poor. I am someone who goes the gym regularly (until recent lockdown) and I am fit and healthy. I also am getting the jitters and muscle twitches all-over. I cant believe someone with a health anxiety would be given something so strong.
I nearly went to the hospital today due to how weak my hands have become. My doctor deterred me and told me it is my health anxiety kicking in. I am struggling to type this message properly. I also had to contact 111 online last night as I was feeling as low about my physical symptoms than I have before.
I have been told to stop by my doc to stop this medication, which I reduced to 7.5mg last week, and he has prescribed me duloxetine. This will be my 5 try at an antidepressant.
Has anyone else had these issues, especially weakness in hands and general lethargy/Coordination problems????
I feel like I'm going mad and have gone back months since taking this stuff!!

day 8 of mirt cold turkey:
Withdrawal symptoms:
feeling sick (stomach churning sometimes the sickness wakes me up)
extremely vivid nightmares and broken sleep
rash on legs
tension headache
heart palpitations
feeling hot and cold
I decided to stop taking mirtazipine cold turkey after 4 months due to extreme weight gain which was making me even more depressed. the pill was amazing for sleep and depression to a certain extent (the weight gain was making me really really upset so unsure as to whether it would have worked without the above) but for me, 4 months in and over 2 stone gained in weight, it just wasnt worth it. All of the above withdrawal symptoms are manageable for me as I am keeping my mind occupied with losing the weight.

"Hi guys, I'm just starting 15mg of Mirtazapine and I hear a lot about weight gain but as far as I can see the weight increase is only a result of feeding the increased appetite. The drug doesn't appear to have any physiological effects which cause weight gain that I've read of.
What I want to know from users of Mirtazapine is did they experience a change in weight when using and did this coincide with a change in eating habit?

"Hi, i am having such problems with my sleep. i have tried herbal sleeping remedies after being refused Zopiclone by the Dr,but they make me have palpitations and feel uneasy all night. I am on 37 1/2 mg of MIRTAZAPINE.
i have tried relaxation tapes etc but they aren't helping. i have in the past bought Zopiclone on line but they dont seem to be prescribing them at the moment. Are there any suggestions for sleeping, i am probably only getting about 2 hours at the moment.

"Hey guys,
So I am benzo free since July 1st 2019. I am at a point now where I feel ready to taper off the Mirtazapine. I tried before just dry cutting and the withdrawal was too intense kept going multiple days in a row without sleep. I should also mention that I also quit using medical Cannabis 3 months ago after using it for sleep during my benzo taper. It wasn't easy to quit either at any rate I'm now at a place where I feel ready to taper off the Mirtazapine again this time liquid tapering.
I had heard that using alcohol as a solvent may not be the best idea for liquid tapering as alcohol is GABAergic and could harm recovery and had read for this reason Propylene Glycol maybe a better alternative as there is supposedly no alcohol content in Propylene Glycol however what's confusing is when you google Propylene Glycol and look it up on Wikipedia it says "" .. Containing two alcohol groups, it is classed as a diol. It is miscible with a broad range of solvents, including water, acetone, and chloroform.""
So is Propylene Glycol an alcohol or not just like the type we can't touch while in recovery(ethanol/methanol) Is it even safe
to use on a liquid taper? Does it even work for Mirtazapine? I'm confused I thought that if anything has alcohol content it had to be listed on the bottle itself and on Amazon itself it says "" This is not alcohol"" but Wikipedia says otherwise??
I'm confused and just wanna make sure I'm not gonna have a bad reaction using it to taper off the Mirtazapine while also in benzo recovery. I ordered a litre bottle to start my taper off Mirtazapine and now I'm worried it may not be safe to use as a solvent as it's just basically like using drinking alcohol??

"Hello, Im new here but I was just trying to get an idea of whats going on with these drugs.
So my gf of 4 years was taking sertraline for a month or so before she decided she needed a break from the relationship, she said she felt like she couldn't love anymore and that she didn't want to burden me with her problems along with a ton of other things. A month has gone by and communication carried on although I felt like the relationship was doomed, lost forever. I still want to be there for her and help, just in case she comes back around to me. But it seems like it may take years and I dont know how long I can hang around.
She is now reducing her sertraline doseage over a week and will move onto mirtazapine due to other side effects the serts were giving her. I understand mirtazapine does the same thing to the brain as the SSRIs but in a different way.
I was just wondering if anyone could tell me if the mirtazapine causes a strain on relationships? A feeling of not being able to love? And if you can give me some advice on how to go about treating her right in this new territory of experimenting with anti-depressants?
Thanks, hope it wasnt too much waffle for you to read. I feel abit lost and I just want to help.

"Hello all,
I've been on Mirtazapine for four months (15mg) prescribed to me for depression and anxiety. I have always struggled with maintaining a desired weight but historically found it very easy to lose a stone before holidays through exercise and calorie counting. According to 6 years of logging into MyFitnessPal my trend it that I am around the 10 stone mark in winter and the 9 stone mark in the summer. Started Mirt in December, by January I was 10.5 stone - no problem, I will do more exercise and watch my eating. NOPE - literally had zero energy to go to the gym and my craving for carbs and chocolate far surpassed anything i have ever experienced. February - 11 stone - i have never been this heavy but its fine, its just another stone to lose. By this time i am religiously counting my calories (1500 max per day) and exercising and also doing intermittent fasting. Weighed myself last week and i am now 12 stone! how can this be? i really dont know what to do at this point and ironically the rapid weight gain is causing my depression to heighten. I have skipped my meds for the last two nights and feel no different - a little light headed but nothing that i cant handle.
Any advice please? x

"Hi, I wanted to come off 30mg of Mirtazapine because of tiredness and weight gain. When i was first put on it, my doctor said that it didn't cause withdrawal and that I could stop it whenever i wanted (I've come to think that this is not true).
That's what I did last Sunday--I went from 30mg to nothing. The first three days were fine, but then starting Wednesday I started getting dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, bad stomach cramps, increased anxiety, etc. I've been using .25mg of Klonopin as needed, but last night I was so anxious and my stomach so uncomfortable that I couldn't fall asleep. I figured I was going through withdrawal and came off too quickly, so I was forced to take 15mg of Mirtazapine last night.
So my question is how should I go forward with my taper? I am adamant to take 15mg for too long since I was off of it completely for 6 days, and I don't want to go backwards. On the other hand, I'd like to mitigate feeling like crap again. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.

"Hi guys,
So I have been on mirtazapine for roughly two years and the weight gain has really gotten me down so I made the decision (in consultation with my doctor) to come off it. I was on 30mg at night and I had heard about (and experienced previously) what happens if you just stop taking it altogether. With this in mind I tapered down to 22.75mg for about 10 days and am now on 15mg. I don't feel any different in my mood, which is great, but I'm also not noticing any of these withdrawal symptoms I've read about (or do they only occur when you go cold turkey?), but most frustratingly, I'm actually putting MORE weight on - not much but lessening my dose combined with not eating any sweets (which has been SOOOOO hard), I would have thought/hoped would have the opposite effect?
I guess what I am wondering is do I still have too much in my system and once I'm completely off it should this change? And also, while I'm quite pleased I'm not having any of the nasty side-effects, is that normal or is it another sign there is still too much of it in my system?
Thanks heaps,
Nicole

Please, has anyone had Mirtazipine and found it helpful? and did it cause you to get more infections more easily?
The only thing that helps me is diazepam, but, like you say, they are SO reluctant to give it out, except in low doses and then only for max. 2 weeks. As Covid 19 is likely to last for much, much longer, and that's what's making my anxiety feel out of control now, it's terrifying!

"Hello Everyone
I found this forum in desperation suffering chronic insomnia after abruptly stopping 15mg of mirtazapine.  I naively thought I could just stop without any tapering as I thought my dosage low (15mg) coupled with the fact that I had only been taking it for 5 months.  
I would like advice from anyone in a similar boat.  My main problem is dreadful insomnia.  I battle to fall asleep.  I have had nights when I am awake the entire night, going to bed at midnight and still awake at 5.00am.  It's a mixed bag at present.  Some nights I will get 3-4 hours sleep.  Other nights maybe 5 -6 hours if I'm lucky.  My mind races and I get stomach gurgling and anxiety.  
Please someone tell me that this state will pass.  I would like to hear from someone who has withdrawn from this drug successfully and had their natural sleep pattern/rhythm return eventually.  And when approximately this can happen.  I did read that 3 months is a fair expectation for complete withdrawal but would really appreciate any first hand experiences.
I have explained all this to my doctor but refuse to go on a different AD so she has given me a 2 week supply of zopiclone as a security blanket for bad nights.  I panic at the thought that two weeks is hardly a comfort if I thought that this chronic insomnia can last for many more months.

"A number of people have asked for withdrawal advice thinking it is a mine field, it isn't, if followed slowly and carefully it is pretty straight forward.
Mirtazapine is available in 3 different forms, tablets of 15, 30, & 45mg,  Sol Tabs which can be dissolved and liquid.   The liquid is very expensive, only available in the UK, and doctors are reluctant to prescribe it because it costs approx £66.  Maybe you could get the latter on a private prescription - beware that the liquid, once opened only lasts for 6 weeks, which may be an issue once at the lower end of the doses.
Sol Tabs can be very useful if you are withdrawing, or maybe even if you are changing doses.  SolTabs dissolve very readily in water but they settle due to the fact that Mirt' is not soluble.  Ora-Plus suspension liquid, available from amazon (around £19) will help with this, it does keep the Mirt suspended long enough to dose accurately.  
For every milligram of Mirt, add the same amount of liquid
I would suggest half water and half Ora-Plus
So if you want to taper from 15 mg less 10% = 13.5 mg 
Mix 3 x 15 mg (45 mg in total) Sol Tabs of Mirt with 45 ml of water
Each nightly dose is 13.5 ml - using a 20 ml syringe draw up the 13.5 ml
The method above is enough for 3 nights, throw away the remainder, and on day 4 start agin.  Of course you can adjust how many Sol Tabs you use as and when necessary.
*You will need a 20 ml syringe and also a 1ml syringe with markings on at   0.1ml intervals
*A small accurate measuring jug or medicine cup with measure on.
If you are tapering from 30 mg less 10% = 27 mg = 27 ml
Liquid Mirt' is ready to use, but the ml to mg is different and needs working out, for instance 12.75 mg Tablet = 0.85 ml liquid Mirt, 7.5 mg tablet = 0.5 ml liquid Mirt.  If anyone wants the breakdown I'm happy to share/send my copy.
People who have been on Mirt' for a considerable time, especially if over a year, would benefit from doing a slower taper of 5% every 2-3 weeks (me also), or maybe those of us who are sensitive to the drops.
Happy to help if anyone needs more info' ~ wishing you well, as always.

"Hi everyone,
A week ago, I came off mirtazapine. I was taking 15mg a night for around 18 months, before this I was one mirtazapine for years but came off it about two times. Before I came off the drug a week ago, I halved the dosage to 7.5mg for 3 nights. 
I have had a lot of interesting (and annoying) side effects including:
- Itching 
- Shorter sleeps
- Sweating when waking and sweating easily with minimal effort
-Snotty nose 
- Feeling emotionally depleted with low mood
- Feeling as though every molecule in my body in at my skin and vibrating (weird I know)
Now in the past 24-48 hours by low mood is increasing even more, increased itching, weird appetite/feeling in stomach and my friend said that I seem a bit manic in terms of my spending (which I think is probably related to the low mood and it is rewarding my brain!) I have also been feeling extra irritated and bothered I guess too. 
I have been taking 2-4mg of valium daily to also help with the withdrawals and have been drinking 1-3 alcoholic drinks a day as well (this isn't too abnormal for me). 
Just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or has any advice for me? And also, how many will it take for these symptoms to go away after being on 15mg of mirtazapine?

"Firstly, this drug is absolutely horrible this is how it went for me:
15mg for 4 weeks, after that I cut the pill in 1.2 to 7.5mg then did 2 weeks like this, then did one day on and one day off, then went to two days on and two days off, then I stopped, I was told by my stupid doctor he could only prescribe 15mg, fine so thats what I have to work with.
He originally told me I could stop cold turkey, which I ignored and I am glad I did, it seems doctors are clueless about the crap they give patients.
So all was well, feeling OK then recently my anxitiy is really high, I am sweating lots, I am dizzy all the time and when sleeping and turning over I get vertigo for about 10 seconds, feeling sick in the morning, and I am sure this is all withdrawal from this nasty drug.
Its out my system, but I guess my brain needs time to readjust, is this the case, and how long will all this last, I am hoping no more than a month, issue is I had a head trauma in December 2018 and this drug seems to be mirroring all my old symptoms, did tell my GP this would happen but they do not listen or care.
The withdrawal symptoms last for maybe one month, or two or 4 (the internet is not very helpful on the how long) - I am just wondering what I am im for, as people say I am getting worse again, but I am sure this is the drug - why do they put people on this awful stuff.
I know I am not going back on this drug to ""fix"" the issues its caused, and I will never be doing anti-depressants again, first Citalopram now this nasty crap - they simple do not work most people (based on the forums here)
I so do not trust anything that comes out any of my GP mouths, you can tell they are lying their lips are moving.

"Hello everyone,
I started taking medication when I was around 15 and am currently on the following:
Cymbalta 60 MG
Clonazepam. 25 MG
Mirtazapine....
I'm 27 now. I began my taper almost two years ago, and successfully made my way down to 1MG from 7.5, which I took for well over five years (after being on 15 MG. So I guess I've been tapering for longer than two years!)
I was lucky to only have six weeks of really bad withdrawal symptoms once I started coming off of 7.5 MG. Nausea, insomnia, depersonalization, irritability, lack of concentration, you know how it goes.
I felt really good after I stopped 1 MG. For about two weeks, I woke up refreshed, had more focus, and more energy in general. I was significantly less irritable.
Then it was too good to be true and I'm pretty sad about it. It feels like I have a mild case of gastroenteritis most days and there's a lot of food I can't eat. I haven't slept through the night in over a month and while I can pretty successfully knock myself out with copious sleep support supplements (Melatonin, Passion Flower, Lemon Balm, Glycine) and OCASSIONALLY upping other meds I take (clonazepam), it's hard for me to tell how well I'm doing because I'm so run down from broken sleep. I usually spend my weekends catching up, so now I'm back in bed too tired to do anything again (which is why I stopped).
It's been a little over a month since I stopped taking Mirtazapine. I'm really hoping for tips to get over this hurdle, and am hoping someone who has successfully stopped this horrible drug might have recommendations.
It's really discouraging to see post after post of people in such bad shape. I was a kid when I let someone put me on a lot of meds I arguably didn't need so many of and at such high doses, but my parents were trying to be good parents and listened to a very script happy doctor.
I had no idea that when I was 15 and just wanted help I would be signing up for this. I've always been so responsible and it's really hard to be this uncomfortable and have had so much of my twenties taken by side effects from medication.
I'm working really hard to heal myself. Thank you for listening.

"Hi all I'm new here but I've tried a few antidepressants in the past, the only one that seemed to help for long was Viibryd but then that pretty suddenly stopped working so my doc put me on mirtzapine. The first night she told me to take a full 15mg pill and I slept for like 16 hours and felt super awful, groggy, dizzy for the rest of the day. Next night she told me to take 7.5mg so I did and felt better but I take it at 10pm and find that I can't get up til at least around 1pm. This is bad because I have college classes starting at 9am lol and I just have no idea what to do. She also never mentioned tapering off the Viibryd that gave me massive weight gain and night sweats like you wouldn't believe and has not responded to any of my questions. Before this I was already having trouble getting out of bed in the morning for class and I told her so but she still prescribed me the low dose of mirtzapine. So basically what I'm saying is help and when do the side effects ever go away!!

"Hi All. I've been reading the stories on here of people's experiences withdrawing from Mirtazapine. I was only on the thing for 4 weeks due to my anxiety issues and have been off for 6 weeks now. I was on a 15mg dose but went off cold turkey because I couldn't handle the side effects which were, for me, mainly muscle pains in legs and twitching as well as general feeling of malaise and stuffiness plus weight gain and constipation. Upon my first few days of withdrawing I got tingly hands and fingers and headaches and ofcourse sleep wasn't anywhere near as good but they subsided and I felt okay but for the last 4 weeks I have had severe issues with muscle pain mostly after doing anything strenuous and this pain, kind of like muscle spasms, runs from my waist to my toes on both sides and it is extremely uncomfortable. As well as this I get restless legs, more twitching and my veins have been bulging out of my legs since I started taking Mirtazapine. Also had constant diarrhoea pretty much. I have seriously considered if I am developing a neurological disease. I have a follow up doctors appointment tomorrow with my regular doctor however my symptoms have really calmed down in the last 2 or 3 days which is why i am now hoping this just was withdrawal symptoms despite me not being on the tablets for particularly long. Does this sound plausible? If so this drug should be banned it is horrible. I had to see a another doctor for an emergency appointment last week my issues were so bad and she put it all down to anxiety and tried pushing more drugs on me. Beggars belief. If my issues do now resolve I will have to put this all down to Mirtazapine and I would seriously dissuade anyone from having this.

"Hi everyone, 
I am currently at the end of my Mirt taper but have trouble coming off it completely due to rebound insomnia. In my search for advice I found some relevant stories, but still don't get the full picture: 
– how long does it last?
– if doing a taper prevents it from occurring, then what did I do wrong?
– what can I do to help speed up the recovery time?
It seems to be on the most common WD symptoms. I thought it would be helpful not only for me to have a thread about it. 
KINDLY SHARE YOUR STORY WITH THE FOLLOWING DETAILS:
1. How long were you on Mirt? At what dose? Did you taper or CT? If taper – dose reduction or dose elimination? (a few success stories I found used elimination) At what dose did you stop?
2. Did you get rebound insomnia with dose reducion or only when stopping completely? How soon after did it hit you?
3. How bad was it? Most people just say ""terrible"". But is it ""fell-asleep-after-3am"" terrible or ""didn't-sleep-for-3-nights-straight"" terrible? How many hours did you get on average? What's the longest you went with no sleep? If you had insomnia before Mirt, how does it compare?
4. How soon did you notice improvement?
5. Did you find any alternative solutions that helped? (supplements, acupuncture etc)
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING!
Below is my story:
==============
1. I was on Mirt for about 4 month total, including taper (Jan-May 2017). Started at 15mg (for severe acute insomnia + anxiety brought on by insomnia). That dose was too sedating on the next day. Went down to 7.5mg after 2 weeks. Then down to 5mg after another 2 weeks. And from there on did a 0.5 reduction every 2 weeks or so. Finally jumped off after being at 0.5mg for 5 days. 
2. I had some rebound insomnia with earlier tapers, but once I got below 4 mg it was pretty smooth (because of the lower reduction, I guess?). It would hit me sometimes at the night of the reduction, sometimes few days later, and once 2 weeks after the dose drop. When I jumped off back in June for the first 10 days I felt great. But slowly sleep started getting worse and worse: and at 2 week mark to the day it hit me hard.
3. After a dose drop I would get 1-2 rough nights (2-4h of sleep) then things would level and even improve. But after I jumped off, at 2 weeks off mark I got 0 hours a night. I panicked and reinstated at 1mg. I'm now trying a slower taper: over the last 2 weeks went 1 – 0.7 – 0.6 mg. Been having some massive ups and downs: from immediate relief at 1mg, followed by some good nights (7-8h), followed by ""meh"" nights (3-4h), followed by s****y nights (0h). Then some relief again. Etc. 
Before Mir I would often get a garden variety insomnia: I'm an owl and a ""busy brain"". This rebound insomnia is quite different as in it feels very chemical: something it my body prevents me from sleeping. On some nights I would be nicely tired and relax, but as I'm drifting off to sleep, I would be awakened by this ""wave"": pounding heart, sometimes with a hot flash (not a panick attack!) I would shake it off, settle down, but it would happen again and again until I either fall asleep at a crack of dawn or not at all. Some nights I just feel bright awake even though I'm exhausted. I also wake up more than once after I fall asleep (luckily, for brief moments most of the time).
There's also an emotional component that goes with it: I can manage on 2-3 hours of sleep. But 0 hours night send me on an anxiety rollercoaster the next day. I'm a working mom, my days are long and hard, and after a really bad night I just feel powerless, frustrated and emotionally exhausted. I'm teary and fearful. Could this also be part of WD, with some anxiety creeping in?
4. I'm still in the midst of it, trying to figure out my next steps. 
5. Here are a few alternative things I'm trying:
– 200-400mg L-THEANINE 1h before bed (seems calming before going to bed and I don't wake up as often during the night). 
– 400mg Magnesium (don't know if it's helping, but was told it's good)
– fish oil, vitamin D, B in the morning (same – can't take if they help, but good for overall support)
– starting acupuncture next week 
– starting HOLY BASEL to hopefully help with the cortisol spike awakenings
I really hope to read your stories to get some inspiration and power through this tough stretch!

"I've been on Mirtzapine for around 6-7 years, most recently at 45mg. I have to say, I haven't felt depressed however I was feeling exhausted nearly all the time on the pills so decided to come off them. I have been sleeping fine and my lifestyle is relatively healthy however I am still suffering from a high level of fatigue. Is this likely to be Mirtzapine still in my system? If so how long can will take to clear. Thanks for any help.

"i have been off remeron completely for almost 3 weeks aftee being on 30mg for about a year, i felt like it was time to come off since this is my first time being on an antidepressant and the weight gain was awful. the doctor before me also had me on seroquel (which had horribke side effects) and buspar (which infelt did nothing) my doctor agreed and we started the tapering off my meds
everything was fine, and being off the other 2 meds was great (took about 6 months to get off those) until i completely stopped the remeron. insomnia kicked in, anxiety kicked it, mood swings, surges of anger and crying, intrusive thoughts have been running through my head all day . i am trying to push through. my sleep has gotten better, but my mood swings are horrible. I have never experienced anything like this before, and am scared this will not go away.
has anyone else experienced this while coming off of remeron? i feel like no one understands me because they haven't been through this and am desperate to find someone who does. my doctor gave me xanax to help with the anxiety, but have been avoiding it since i don't want to take too much because i don't want to have to deal with another experience like this. if you made it this far on this post, thank you for your time.

"Hi Everyone,
I take 1/2 15mg (so 7.5mg) of Mirtazapine from Teva for sleep and it's worked wonders but now no pharmacy around me carries it anymore, I have no idea what's going on but since then I tried the same dose from a company called Apotex and I do not have the same sleep inducing effect. Desperate I'm now trying the branded version Remeron from Merck and have taken it for around 3 days and so far I feel no different compared to the Apotex version.
Feeling quite worried about this, I expected the brand Remeron to be as good or better than Teva for me, does anyone have any experience switching from generic to brand Remeron and does it take an adjustment period or something?
Anybody know why Teva is being removed from the market in the US?
Thanks.

Mirtazapine and/or pregabalin
I am in one of those med quandaries. Had major anxiety crisis earlier this year and , for reasons which are too dull to put here, i ended up on mirtazapine 30 and pregabalin 20. my side effects were insane, hallucanagenic dreams, terrible muscle cramping, forgetfulness, clumsiness, intense feelings, depressive/suicidal thoughts. I also wanted to eat everything. Having said that my anxiety did eventually go and my mood lifted.However because i took them both at the same time i did not know which effects to attribute to which.
Recently ( after about 6 weeks of being) on the full dose the eating, 'living dead feeling' , cramps were worse and people at work were noticing i was not functioning properly- kept losing things, forgot how to do simple tasks etc. Therefore my doctor lowered mirtazapine to 15.
Three days later and I had flu symptoms, vomitting, shaking and suicidal thoughts- generally very vulnerable and unstable sensation..
I dont really know what is going on or what to do for the best. i know Mirtazapine withdrawal can be pretty bad, and if so i would prefer to get off it before i become too dependent . having said that it may be the pregabalin that is the issue---i have no idea. Gp, though means well, seems to treat me a bit like a chemistry set.
So in summary i wonder if anyone has had similar experience and can confirm what is doing what. And also offer some advice on what they feel would be best to do. x

"Hi guys, after a relative slow taper (not 10%, but still relatively slow) I quit Mirta 8 weeks ago. At first I was fine, untill almost 2 weeks later withdrawal hit me. Sleep started to suffer and my mood took a plunge.
Since then I have been having better days, and nights and sometimes even 2 or 3 days where I sleep 8 hours. But last night I was up again until 4, when I decided to take a benzo. I woke at 7 from a sort of nightmare and was really anxious. Today I could not shake the anxious feeling, and am suffering crying spells, feeling worthless and just very tired. 
This is why I have decided that I might reinstate. Thinking about 1.75 mg, which is not a lot, but it was the dose I was stable on last time. If this doesn't help, I'll probably take 3.50 mg. I'm curious if anyone could comment on this scenario. I am curious if someone else has reinstated after being off it a few weeks? 
I think for me personally, tapering and quitting is easier in spring or summer. Winter is not my best time anyway. 
I am curious about your thoughts!

"I'm still having bouts where I'll need to go pee more often. Been happening now for a few weeks. What's strange though is that this is intermittent. So I'll have three or more days maybe where I'm totally fine, normal urination, no urge etc. then suddenly the next day I'll have this bout where I'll go a few times in succession, like every 2 hours or so. During this time my pee is clear, almost white colour but what's bothering me is why this is happening randomly. I haven't changed my diet or fluid intake. Still no pain or burning or anything severe before or after peeing. Maybe it is what it is but it's really normal for me. Usually I'll only need to pee about 2-3 times for the entire day!
The doctor has no idea about this. It's not high blood sugar as I checked my bs during one of these bouts and it was normal. It could be the mirtazapine / remeron I'm on (15mg) but this is not a known side effect. It's not an infection or uti as 4 urinalysis have come back negative each time. Doctor not concerned about prostate issues, firstly due to my age and secondly because I'm not having any prostate related symptoms. 
So have no idea what to do apart from going back to doctor and requesting an urologist apt. God knows how long that will take. The only thing I could attribute it to is the remeron / mirtazapine but if these are side effects from that then I wasn't getting them when I started it 2 months ago.

**So, I need useful advice, problem is I only have the 15mg tablets, **not sure if I can get the 7.5mg tablets in the UK, I can ask I guess, but I definitely want off this drug, before I get used to it and its more of a nightmare to come off.
Not sure why when you have anxity and depression your Doctor puts you on a drug that makes it all worse, what a stupid idea - I did the same with Citalopram it was awful and I just came off it.
Medication does not agree with me ever, just makes me feel crapper all the time.
Any advice would be great, or will it not be that bad after 7 days?

"Hello,
I would like to ask what i should do with my mirtazapine tapering. I started mirtazapine about 10 months ago with dose of 7.5 mg for sleep. I have tried multiple times to quit it cold turkey and i haven't succeed with this kind of method. My doctor prescibed me Trintellix (Vortioxetine) for depression 10 mg/daily which i ate for 13 days and i didn't see any benefit from it during that short period of time. When i started Trintellix i just stopped mirtazapine cold turkey and i slept ok and anxiety was manageable but at day 6 on trintellix + mirtazapine cold turkey withdrawal i experienced serious increase in anxiety so i ate 7.5 mg mirtazapine and day after that i ate 3.75 mg mirtazapine. My anxiety reduced after this and i was again 5 days without mirtazapine and again terrible anxiety came back, tinnitus and i wake up at 3 am anxious and unable to go back to sleep. I don't know what i should do. It would be really nice if you can recommend good aproach for withdrawing from mirtazapine. I don't really want to eat anymore AD:s because i haven't noticed any benefit from them for depression. Mirtazapine has helpt with sleep alot.

"Hey there!
I went to see my GP today about stopping Mirtazapine. I've been taking 15mg since March last year and while I felt like it did help with my depression in hindsight I've realised just how bad my anxiety became. I've always been quite shy on the inside and found interacting with people - especially those I'm unfamiliar with - nerve racking. But I seldom had what I would recognise as an anxiety problem before last year. It also felt a lot better than Sertraline which had given me all kinds of trouble. Anyway, whilst on it I began obsessively worrying about tiny little issues, to the detriment of my friendships and my mental health overall. I've been feeling better recently and want to be medication free.
Anyway the GP created a very sketchy timetable by hand. It was linear initially, missing a dose extra each week and then he sort of threw in the towel so the end result was pretty comical but also seemed to drop way too fast. I've rehashed it myself so that it follows the following total weekly dose: 90, 75, 60, 45, 30, 22.5, 15, 7.5, Stop.
However I've read quite a few horror stories on here and so I guess what I'm asking is; a). do the majority of people have to taper very conservatively b). regardless of a). is my plan too hasty?
Thanks!

"I'm reaching out for support really. my husband has been on a cocktail of antidepressants for 6 years. in that time he has never felt well. He started on pregablin, which he tapered off. if i knew what I know now I would have said stay off them, but the doctor put him on venalfaxine for 2 years he was in a state so he was taken off it over a 2 week period and put on mirtzapine and this is were we are. He cant work because his anxiety and dizziness is so bad. He has also developed tinitus. He withdrew off mirtzapine for about 6 weeks but felt awful so the doctor put him back on them and he is now shaking. The doctor said it must be him and needs to let them settle however hes been on them 5 weeks now and feels awful. He doesnt know what to do for the best and each doctor he has been to insist on tablets.
any reassurance or guidance please

"Hey guys, I've been taking Mirtazapine for extreme anxiety and panic disorder for roughly two weeks now and I feel like it has really been helping. I've experienced a few side effects, such as weight gain but nothing major. Anyway, the reason I am posting today is because I was curious to know if anyone has experienced fainting with Mirtazapine before? Last night about half an hour or so after I took my usual dose I went outside for a cigarette and all of a sudden this really weird feeling came over me, I put my smoke out and went to go back inside and my body felt really heavy and my vision went weird, kinda like tunnel vision and then I broke out in a body sweat. I managed to make it to my bed and I started to feel a bit better once laying down but my hearing went weird, I heard a ringing sound and my head felt like it was pulsating. It was all very unpleasant, anyway, I have a doctors appointment tomorrow but in the mean time I was curious to know others experiences with this drug and if anyone had experienced anything similar.

"My insomnia began with physical addiction to Xanax, and a horrible doctor did NOT taper me off of Xanax.
I had horrible seizures and then beyond hell insomnia. He then prescribed very, very, very toxic
neuroleptics. I became a total zombie on a very poisonous neuroleptic !!! I developed TARDIVE DYSKINESIA !!!! ( a terrible neurological, permanent brain impairment ) This was 26 years ago !!
I was then prescribed Klonopin which helped me sleep some, but is EXTREMELY physically addicting.
I tried repeatedly to safely ween off of Klonopin, but could not, because of bad insomnia. I was in
the ""psychiatric trap."" Today, as of the start of 2020, i STILL have horrendous insomnia. Sleep maybe
3-4 hours per night. .. This all started due to Xanax for high anxiety... I would have been MUCH better,
if i had never taken even one Xanax. If you have panic or anxiety, please do not take pills. Go to
a talking therapist, and then exercise, eat right, and maybe go to a Natureopathic Doctor.

"One year ago, insomnia and anxiety brought me to mirtazapine, 7.5mg. I've been feeling much better of late, so decided to come off. Over the last forty days I've tapered by grinding down my tablets to uniform sizes, 1mm at a time (I don't have access to liquid mirtazapine). As the doses got lower, I did notice improvements in my daytime mood, as well as IBS symptoms. The past two nights have been my first without taking anything and insomnia is back in full force, but I'm not anxious like I was a year ago. I don't know what to do though and don't know what to expect. Please help before I get anxious and don't sleep for three months again!

"I have always suffered from pain in the neck,shoulders,back and collarbone but now is worse. The ""fun"" part about this is that since i'm still tapering ( im not fully out of this s**t) I can't take anything for pain or muscle relaxer or anything that could take this away for good. Im screw. This pain is horrible!! is debilitating. Does any of you have this same thing? what helped you? my pain last for days. Also, taking the chance, i want to mention another thing i've been experiencing now that i'm at 2.3 mg from my original dose which was 15 mg of remeron, is that i have this, strong intrusive though but is not like other thoughts, is harder and very confusing, i feel super confuse my mind starts to think about hundreds of different themes, i start to feel super scared and desperate, i feel like a monster, it activates my harm ocd and is super scary cannot fully explain.

"I was on a very low dose of mirtazapine for about 3 and half weeks but they made me feel really weird and spaced out so the doctor decided to switch me to sertraline which I've been on for around 2 weeks. This week has been absolute hell. My anxiety is the worst its ever been I feel sick keep waking up drenched in sweat at night and now my legs and back are absolutely killing me. is this withdrawals from the mirtazapine or maybe side effects from the sertraline?

I ate a lot due to increased appetite which is normal but now i can wake up with more energy whilst getting a good nights sleep and i am now tracking pre-prepared food so i dont over indulge.

"I was on 15mg from NOV 2018-Easter 2019 when i successfully tapered down to 7.5mg by July. I was using the skip one day every 2 weeks method which didnt work once i wanted to go lower than 7.5 because i got highs. So after 6 weeks or so trying that I decided to stick with 6mg daily from 1 October and do the 10% taper suggested by surviving anti depressants. I didnt do any drops yet because while I was feeling pretty good there were odd days where I needed a couple extra mg. All was well till 10 days ago when I was very fatigued by over working. At the sametime I took some time off to rest I also started a different brand of mirt provided by the chemist. After 4 days I realised it wasn’t agreeing with me and causing anxiety. The original brand never did this. So the fatigue, which I usually deal with by resting for a day or 2 and am then fine, was compounded by the change of brand which has destabilised me.
Since then (10 days) I have been back on the old brand desperately trying to stabilise. The first week I tried to do 6mg but had a few days of 8 or 9. Saturday I foolishly took about 19. this caused a big problem where i felt sick, couldnt sleep, had trouble eating and got extremely distraught for no reason. I vowed to stick at 6 which my brain has been used to for several weeks and it is about 4 months that ive been on around 7.5. it doesnt seem to be able to handle 15 anymore.
yesterday i was exhausted all day, was eating better but couldnt sleep. took 6mg at 6pm, went to bed at 7. couldnt sleep, took 2 at 11pm, 2 at 12 and 4 at 1. pretty soon after i felt similar to saturday. a friend has told me i must stick to 6 because my brain is used to it and its dangerous to keep changing the dose. i need to believe in myself and not turn to pills the hour i feel bad.
im looking for reassurance really, that im doing the right thing. 15 is definitely too much. i will speak to the gp later.

"Ive been on mirtazapine for over 3 months, first month on 15mg and then 30mg, i'm currently still on 30mg and I'm still having ups and downs, the ups are getting longer but when i crash back down i feel utterly terrible and weird (cant even explain the feeling, just bleh and dont feel myself at all) for a few days. I'm loathe to give them up though because i think these tablets work really well, when they work! but thats the problem, they don't work all the time, i feel like i'm on a roller coaster.
Does anyone else have this ? where you feel back to your normal self for a period of a week or two and then just fall back into feeling bad for a few days ? its can happen overnight or if it happens in the day i can literally feel myself slipping back into a depressed state, i start to get irritable and moody, then the lethargy and weird feelings come and i don't want to do anything for a few days, the worst thing about the crash period is it feels like it will be permanent but it usually does dissipate and i'll feel good again soon.
Mirtazapine has definitely helped me because when i first started i couldn't get out of bed but I sometimes wonder if Mirt is actually the problem and not the solution now ? i suppose the only way to figure that out is to taper down on them.

"My doctor originally put me on 15 mgs Mirtazapine to help with my sleep and anxiety. But now I'm sleeping too much and upon awakening in the AM (even after 8-10 hours of sleep), I am still so majorly fatigued and feel like a zombie. Plus, I've gained a lot of weight and want to eat all the time. So now I'm weaning off of Mirt and went down to about 7.5mgs a night. Even at that dosage, I am still having these side effects. Now, I'm literally shaving a tiny tiny piece of the tablet a week at a time until I'm completely off. This is my 2nd time trying to go lower than 3.75mgs. The 1st time I tried to go lower than that, my anxiety increased and I also was not sleeping very well.
Now there are other possible contributors to my anxiety and insomnia increase. I suffer from chronic pain which tenses my muscles up constantly. I feel like my body is in constant ""fight or flight"" response and just cant relax, no matter what I do. I also have mild sleep apnea, which may be a contributor, so between the chronic pain and sleep apnea, my sleep gets interrupted.
I am also on Fluoxetine, Buspirone, Lamotrigine, and Clonazepam, along with the Mirtazapine..
I would appreciate any feedback on my post and wonder if anyone has any safe and good tips on how to get off of Mirt without dealing with so many withdrawal effects.
Thanks!

"Hi,
I know this gets asked a thousand times but I just wanted somewhere to vent my experiences so far and I really don't want to bother or concern anyone in my life. I told a few people I was on Mirtazipine and warned them that I was coming off them. But now that I am in the thick of it, I can't tell if I am overthinking things or my own thoughts so I don't want to burden anyone.
I started on 15mg about 8 months ago after I was getting anxiety and low mood, which I've always had. But they were exceptionally bad because of the situation in my personal life - being in a relationship with someone who was always in some sort of stressful situation and would give me hell about stressing them out if I spoke about my own feelings. I was their support for a year and it pushed me over the edge. So I went to a doctor, who started me on the meds. In their wisdom within 2 months the doctor had me on their maximum dose, 45mg - they said the side effects are better on the highest dose (this seems at odds with everything I've since read on forums like these).
It definitely helped with the low mood and the insomnia, but after I was no longer needed as a crutch, the relationship ended. After a few months I processed this, but the medication left me feeling groggy, apathetic and bloated/heavier than I have ever been (I always struggled with weight gain, now I have a moon face).
So I decided to come down off them. The doctor lowered me to 30mg for a month, had no issues at all. So a month later went back and down to 15mg to review again in a month. I've been on 15mg for a few days now. Didn't feel that different at first but now I am not sure what is going on. I haven't had any physical symptoms (yet), but I seem to be irrationally upset about things - at least I think I am being irrational. That's the hard thing. Like, a few friends I saw on social media went out last night, and didn't mention it. Even though the logical part of me is like - a few people went out independently and all hooked up since they were out. And I'm now sitting having stared at the ceiling wondering if anyone would know if I ever just vanished. This isn't me.
So... sorry for the long story, but has anyone experienced similar on similar doses? I'm not normally a dramatic person. I'm due to go to a wedding party tonight and I've turned my phone off and am sitting in my room in the dark - I haven't done anything socially/left the house for about 8 days. I can't face it.

"Hiya, so I took Mirtazapine last night as the doctor prescribed it to treat anxiety. Fell asleep rather fast and woke up initially feeling refreshed. However, I had to come home from work as I felt so spaced out and sick (the motion of travelling knocked me ill) and I have a huge phobia of throwing up. I don't like the heavy feeling it's having on my head so I'd rather just come off them, I know I've only taken one and it's all new and stuff but I like to listen to my body.
The question is, is it safe to just stop taking them since I've only take on 15mg pill?

"has anyone successfully withdrawn from mirtazapine? need help on which method I should use. I was put on 15mg for insomnia and it only helped me sleep for 3 days. I still suffer from insomnia but had improved some. at one point I was not getting any sleep now every night I get at least 3 to 4 hours broken. on good night 6 hrs less broken. sometimes I feel like mirtazapine is waking me up rather than helping with sleep. I am not taking other medications. i do take melatonin, l theanine, and GABA supplements. the doctors are no help. the GP said to drop down to 7.5mg for one week then every other night one week then stop. she said it would take 2 weeks to stop. I made the mistake of looking for and setting up appointment with psychiatrist to see if he had knowledge to guide my taper. It didnt go well as he said to stop cold turkey. when I asked him about tapering and withdrawal symptoms he got very upset saying who told me that. I told him I read warnings not to stop abruptly and many people reporting suffering from withdrawls. he stated that I must have anxiety and started writing and adding diagnosis on my chart saying I must have it as I'm questioning him. I stopped talking for fear he would add more to my chart for asking reasonable questions. of course I'm anxious about getting off this medication after reading horror stories about withdrawal. he used this as a way to intimidate to stop asking any questions. he also prescribed 10mg Doxepin which I havent started as I am not willing to go cold turkey off mirtazapine. he did say I could take it with mirtazapine but am reluctant as there is a serious drug interaction taking both.
I also dont want to add another med to struggle coming off of.
please any help or advice. I have heard about 10% every 3 to 4 weeks and also CITA protocol charts of skipping doses. I am not sure which would be the best method to minimize or avoid bad withdrawal symptoms.

"I was prescribed these pills (15mg, then increased to 30mg, now I am back to 15mg again), back in the Spring of 2018 as I was suffering from constant headaches and dizziness. Since taking the pills, trying CBT and relaxing didn't resolve the dizziness. My dizziness has begun to subside (I have had every check possible, from CT scan, thorough blood tests, X-Rays etc.) and being told this is all in my head.
I want to deal with this without meds, though every time I try to stop I get bad headaches and nausea, to the point I think I feel dizzy. I feel off since lowering down to 15mg from 30mg 5 days ago, off as in headaches, off balance and generally fuzzy headed.
I hope this makes sense to people as it is so hard to describe how I feel with all this kind of want reassurance there is an end to all this.

I wake up every morning 5 am and feel exhausted, diarrhea, cold then warm, nose stuffed up constantly. SLOW tapering isn't helping. Thinking going cold turkey because can't feel any worst. I am also on Celexa which been on for 15 yrs. It was lower to 20mg while on mirt.

"Hi everyone, I've been on Mirtazapine for 3+ months, no higher than 15mgs. I'm now on 6.75 and am doing a slow10% reduction after foolishly stopping them abruptly twice and hitting a wall with the side effects! I""m now suffering with quite severe lower back pain that can come and go but also right sided, constant ache. Also strange lower arm and hand weakness as well as numerous other unrelated symptoms such as night sweats and a deterioration with vision. I had none of these symptoms before starting the Mirt, which I was prescribed for insomnia. My sleep is the only thing that has improved and I think that there must be a better way to get a good nights sleep than taking this pill. Does anyone else have these symptoms on such a small dose and after such a short time? I also take vit B and Magnesium+zinc.

"Ive been taking mirtazapine for about 10 years and I've been slowly been tapering off for about a year.
I took my last dose of 7.5mg three weeks ago. The withdrawal has been awful but I think I'm getting through that now. The only thing I am really struggling with now is the insomnia, I'm not getting more than 3 hours sleep a night.
The doctors have recommend I start taking amitriptyline to help me sleep but I really want to avoid this as it's just replacing one drug with another.
My question is, does anyone have any idea as to how long the insomnia will last? I'm trying to find some positive stories to get me through!

"Hi
I'm in the process of coming off Mirtazapine and will then be starting on Venlafaxine.
I was taking 45mg Mirtazapine each night. So I've been prescribed 15mg tablets of mirtazapine and the venlafaxine. I am to take 2x 15mg for one week. Then on the second week I am to take one of the 15mg mirtazapine and one of the venlafaxine. Then on the third week I am to take two of the venlafaxine and no mirtazapine.
This first week started last Wednesday, so I'm just at the first stage where I am taking less mirtazapine to begin with. The next day, I had physical symptoms of anxiety although I didn't really have any anxious thoughts. Just shaking hands and a shaking/panicked feeling inside my chest. I've also been prescribed propanolol for anxiety so I decided to take some and it seemed to help.
Since then though I have been more and more tired, and feeling very weird. I can't really explain it, everything just seems very strange. I've got no energy to do anything. I can just lay in bed and time seems to vanish in no time. I don't think I've been falling asleep in the day time, I think I just lay there with my eyes closed. I feel like I don't know what's going on.

"Hi!
I've now been off all my psych poisons 4 quite some time: Gabapentin (on 4 14 years off for 4 years), Zoplicone (on for 7 months off for 4 years), Seroquel (on for 3 1/2 years off for 3 1/2 years) and the last one Remeron (on for 14 years off for 29 months) and I'm still going through hell almost 24/7. The symptoms I'm still experiencing r: chronic insomnia (very little, if any sleep most nights and days), burning, tingling, numbness throughout body and brain, burning brain, vibrations throughout body and brain, dp/dr, hearing loss, adrenaline surges, chronic fatigue/exhaustion, myoclonic jerks, panicky/jittery and the list goes on.
I have had several small windows while tapering and some while being totally off. However, when I do get a window it appears the symptoms keep coming back with a vengeance either in a few hours or the next day. I'm 65 years old and don't know how much more of this torture my body and mind can take. I haven't had a decent nights sleep since 2013 when this hellish nightmare began. I'm totally alone, have no one to help me with anything and my family of origin wants me dead. They have spoken to me in the past 5 years and have actually left me to die alone. My mother has abused me all my life and three years ago went into an assisted living situation and told everyone not to let me know where she is. She is a pathelogical liar, narsarcisstic and delusional as r my brother and sister.
I have tried a zillion things to help with what I'm going through and nothing makes any difference in the way I'm feeling. I've got to the point I just want 2 die as I have no one and nothing to look forward to. I've lost all interest in life and just want to get to Heaven to be with God and my 3 little dogs where there is no more of this horrendous torture. I've lost all hope that I will ever recover from this. Everyday and night is the same with just horrible ongoing torturous pain.
Please, if there is anyone out there that has or is going through same or similar symptoms and would b willing 2 chat with me either on Facebook video messenger or by phone, it would b greatly appreciate. If u private message me your phone number I will call u. I have free long distance in Canada and United States. I'm desperate 2 get some relief from this inhumane suffering. Also, if anyone would b willing 2 b my buddy and help walk me though the rest of this, that too would b greatly appreciated. Thank you.

"i have been on mirtazapine for over 3 years and have seriously had enough of how it has made me feel. i started at 15mg then 30mg then quickly on 45mg. i have personality disorder and PTSD a have been on a therapy waiting list for nearly 2 years which is ridiculous. i am isolated, live alone and have no family or friends. All this stuff has ever done is cause me to become numb minded, seriously over weight and unsociable to the point i have become nocturnal so that i never have to even see another person. it no longer helps me sleep in fact i am also full of anger and hate noise or people. i skulk around my 24hour supermarket at 3 - 5am so i dont have to speak to anyone . self service checkout is great for this. i wasnt like this before these meds . I wasnt exactly a social butterfly but i didnt nearly die from a panic attack if someone approached me outside to ask for the time or pet my dog (who also now shares my isolated nocturnal existence) I have tried several times to stop this meds without success. every doc i ever spoke to just looked at me like im stupid whenever i mention my problems blaming it all on my PTSD but i know my own mind. I have had PTSD for years and years and was able to function better before this stuff was given to me. i now have a weight problem, headaches, anger, cannot work due to excess weight causing back problems and asthma. i am thinking about death every single day. I am constantly expecting horrible things like a arson attack on my home, someone murdering me while walking the dog at night, i keep a log of unfamiliar cars on my street, im i am obsessively clean. i am emotional. i have recently reduced my dose from 45mg to 30mg last month and next month i will be doing 30mg one day and 15mg the next etcetera for 2 months then go for 15mg for 2 months then 15mg one day then half a pill (7.5mg) the next etcetera for 2 months then half a pill (7.5mg) for a month then stop altogether. i have been advised to do this by a doctor i saw last month. this doctor was a new doctor i have never seen before because he was standing in for my regular doc who was on leave and he suggested this as the best way to stop taking it. he is also the first and only doctor i have met who 100% agreed that mirtazapine is a awful drug and is absolutely unsuitable for my condition and if he had been my original doctor he would never have put me on it. Therapy is what i need but I have been waiting for so long now that i dont even want to speak to a therapist. I need to talk with someone who has been through the same as me, someone who understands what its like to be abandoned and abused as a kid and or knows what its like to be shot by a gunman on a motorcycle in a murder attempt on me, someone who understands what its like to be awoken by a house on fire in a second murder attempt and absolutely nobody on either occassion being arrested or charged because the local police force were working for gangsters who had more power and influence than them. all of this when i was 17 years old and i am now nearly 40 and still living in hell.

"So comebacktolife nickname has come about from 8 months on mirt, now at 45mg. I was suffering from depression, anxiety etc in Feb of 2019. I suppose the mirt did its thing and helped numb me for a few months, but now I believe it is now the cause of bouts of depression, anxiety and feelings of dred. I know myself well and I know that these negative feelings are no longer of my own personal makings and it is this drug which is no longer my friend. Simply, I want my life back, I want to be me again, how I was before the mirt and of course before the depression, which I know has now run its natural course and so if I can only just get off the mirtazapine I can lose the weight, my tongue won't feel numb and tingly, my muscles will no longer feel painful, I won't feel as drowsy, I will wake up with energy and the dred and anxiety will be a thing of the past. Now here is the difficult bit, to begin withdrawing. I have to also add here, that if I had done some research of my own before starting the mirt, to understand the withdrawal process, then I may have reconsidered. I would be irresponsible if I didn't add that mirt for some people may be the drug that fixes their problems and coming off it isn't too much of an effort. We are all very different and drugs will react with us in very different ways. Unfortunately, I think I may be one of the percentage that may suffer with the withdrawal. I only say this as I recently went from 45mg to 30 and had the most painful headaches. I also experienced anxiety, which would come about for no reason at all. I would wake up, the day was going to be an average day, but there was that anxiety and sometimes dred creeped into the mix also.
Where am I now? I am back on 45mg of tablet mirtazapin. I have been on this high dose for about 10 weeks. I wanted to come off the mirt completely over the next two months, but my doctor says that is too quick. I have to admit that it is pretty scary to think that I am trapped with having to take this drug now, like it or not, for the next several months. Any other drug I've had in the past (Non brain effecting drug) I have completed the course and that's it, but antidepressents appear to be a whole new ball game. I may be one of the lucky ones where a quickish withdrawal will not be a problem, but for safety I think I will do it slowly. I have the liquid form of mirt ready to pick up from the pharmacist and once I have begun with that I will keep anybody who is interested (May be nobody, that's fine) up to date with a two to three week account of how things are going. So, just to recap, I am on 45mg tablet, I presently am suffering anxiety, headaches, numb tingling of the tongue, painful muscles, tiredness and, on a bad day, a feeling of dred. I know none of this is me and it's the mirt. My goal to be completely off mirt is 1st of jan 2020. Let's see how I get on. Fingers crossed!

"Hi Everyone,
I would appreciate any advice on the following please... I have been on Mirtazapine since Oct 18, started on 15mg & gradually increased to 45mg, presecibed for Depression and OCD (I'm also on Fluoxetine 30mg which I plan to stay to keep the OCD at bay). Over the past 8 weeks I have gradually tapered from 45mg to 15mg with no problems,the next step was to go 15mg to 7.5mg, I managed only 2 days on the 7.5mg and have had to go back to 15mg. I've had the most awful anxiety since saturday, I feel so defeated especially as in recent weeks I have felt my best since my breakdown last October. Has anyone had a similar experience or have any advice? Will the anxiety lesson as I continue on the 15mg? I see my psychiatrist next week so hopefully he can shed some light on why tapering at the low dose has been so difficult.
Many thanks

"After spending a sometime in rehab last year it was suggested that antidepressants would help in my recovery as I was experiencing anxiety, paranoia, OCD and a complete inablility to switch off.
A fellow also in recovery suggested sertraline so off I trot to the docs who duly prescribes 25mg of sertraline this seemed to be bedding in well so I went back for a review after 3 weeks and the docs( a more senior one) puts me on mirtaxapine (I was experiencing a bit of a dip in spirits but thought that was part of the journey).
I’m now on week 4 of Mirtazapine (30 mg) and cant say I feel any better than when I was on sertraline, apart from lethargy in the evening and being irritable with the occasional feeling of rage.
This feels completely contrary to what an anti-depressants should achieve, last week I found myself on the wrong side of the road trying to force another car off the road, normally I’m quite placid but this shocked me ( also had 3 yr old in car).
The lethargy I can handle but is the rage normal will it pass?
Is it just a matter of trial and error to find the right meds?
The docs I saw were GP would it be an idea to seek an opinion from a specialist where I had the rehab.
Cheers

"Hi All,
I have recently started Mirtazapine as a replacement for Sertraline (that I really couldn't cope with due to the extreme side effects I experienced).
I was only on Sertraline 50mg for 7 days and then 100mg for 2 days and after GP advice went to every other day and stopped.
I then started Mirtazpine and apart from sleeping for most of the day after the first nightly dose, they seemed okay apart from the urge to snack! and being a bit sleepy (This is day 8 of Mirtazapine 15mg, and I am to go to 30mg in week)
However, I am now constantly jumpy and have pretty constant palpitations.
Have you guys experienced palpitations/jumpiness on Mirtazapine? or you reckon its Sertraline withdrawal?.
I'm asking as its not listed on the side effects pullout, and a Dr Google has scared me a bit.

"I've not been on it for long but am tapering off - I've also been put on Escitalopram and intend to remain on that for my underlying anxiety issues. I need to come off the Mirt though as I am not happy with the weight gain already, in only a month - it's not something I'll be happy to stay on long term. I haven't been taking it for very long at all - less than a month - so I am hoping the withdrawal will be minimal. I have to be very careful though as my initial problems stem from severe insomnia, so I need to avoid rebound insomnia at all costs!
I've managed to taper without problems from 30mg to 22mg to 15mg to 10mg over 3 weeks and have now been on 7.5mg for the last 3 nights. Since being on 7.5mg I feel pretty rough - I'm sleeping ok (despite the nightmares, but they don't really bother me) but still feel really tired the next day, plus I am SUPER irritable and grumpy (like the worst PMS you can imagine... no one come near me!!) and I have terrible muscle aches all up my legs, it hurts even to walk up the stairs. I know now that Mirt is more sedating at lower doses so I'm not surprised on the sleepiness, but are the rest of the symptoms / side effects I've listed also increased at lower doses? Not sure why I would have not experienced them at 15 / 10mg but am now. I wondered if anyone has successfully tapered off and had any experience of it to share? None of it is unbearable, it's just all pretty yucky and considering I intend to taper really slowly off the last amount, I'm wondering if these side effects will remain for the whole time... xx

"Hi all, i have been using the drug for 5 years or so - 15mg daily.
I have been tapering slowing from March this year until July, with no problems. I have reached 3.75 . However, upon the first night of the 0 dosage, hell broke loose - i could not sleep more than 4 hours. I had no problem sleeping.
I rushed to the doctor and he told me ""just hold on to it, it will get better in 1 or 2 weeks tops"".
However, after those 14 days have passed, i gave up ,and went back to 1.8. We only have 30mg tablets here, and it's already difficult to get to that 1.8, so no chance of going smaller than that. that 1.8 allowed me to sleep more or less, but with 0 - cannot go over 4 h hours.

"Hi there, new to this site and glad to find this community.
I have been taking Remeron 7.5mg for depression and anxiety for 6 weeks now, along with 5mg Buspar x2/day. Before taking Remeron, I tried Paxil, but the side effect was too strong and had to stop. Remeron 7.5mg helped me with sleep and appetite greatly since the first week. Mood wise I started to feel like almost normal at week 4, I was so happy about it, but something triggered at week 5 and the mood went back to low since then. I'm wondering if the dosage is not enough to stabilize the mood.
I will see my doctor in 2 days and would like to seek some suggestion or experience so that I can have a better discussion with her. I can think of 2 options going forward. Option 1 would be simply increase the Remeron dosage, like 15mg. Option 2 would be adding a different SSRI and keep Remeron 7.5mg, maybe tape off Buspar. If option 2, I would like to have a SSRI with less side effect than Paxil, maybe lexapro or Celexa? Any suggestions or experience to share are greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone.

"Hi,
Due to weight gain since starting this medication 9 months ago I have decided to start tapering off Mirtazapine 45mg (I'm also taking Fluoxetine 30mg for OCD which I plan to stay on). For the past 2 weeks I have taken 45mg one night & 30mg the next. I have felt terrible all week, anxiety has been on terror levels, and today I feel like I'm coming down with the flu, aches/pains, tiredness etc and was unable to go to work.
Has anybody experienced anything similiar after just one dosage reduction? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Ps I have discussed coming off with both my GP & Psychiatrist who are both happy for me to come off the medication - I just forgot to ask what to expect!

I miss how it made my low mood go away and I started doing jobs around the house and basically started living again. But I was so angry all the time and eventually I had to make the decision to come off them as I was making my families lives unbearable. My question is, has anyone had anything prescribed to counter the effects of the anger issues and still took Mirtazapine. I dont know if there is anything you can take in conjunction to calm you down. My only other options after Duloxetine are Amytriptlyne ( which my GP said she wouldnt prescribe me ) and Quetiapine. Thank you in advance. Regards and thanks. Keith

"Hi,
I have been on 30mg of Mirtazapine for 7 months, it was prescribed to me for anxiety related to abdominal/digestive issues. I still have the abdominal symptoms and health anxiety. I believe there's something seriously wrong with me, that has been missed on the numerous tests that I have had.
I'm at a point now where I am questioning whether I still need to be on the Mirtazapine and if it is doing anything to help me.
One thing I know it is doing, is helping me sleep, but on the other hand I am constantly tired. I don't know to what extent it is helping my anxiety, as I still have anxiety but I don't know if it would be much worse without the Mirtazapine. I also get spells of dizziness, I had previously thought that this symptom was related to my abdominal/digestive issues, but I am now considering that it may be a side effect of the Mirtazapine. I am also wondering if any of my other symptoms, such as burning lips are related to the Mirtazapine or my abdominal/digestive issues.
My doctors have written my off as psychosomatic/all in the head with regard to my abdominal issues and are pretty useless when it comes to the Mirtazapine as well, they were quick to put me on it, but now I have questions about it, they can't seem to help, there answer is to just stop taking it, but I am very reluctant to do that from what I have read about withdrawal.
I'm wondering whether to I should think about coming off Mirtazapine and/or considering an alternative medication for my anxiety.
Any thoughts?

"Hello everyone,
Thank you for taking the time to read my post, I am quite grief stricken and I am not sure what kind of decision to make regarding my father, whom I love very much.
The hospital wants to know whether or not my father will undergo a tube insertion into his stomach because he was unable to safely pass the swallow test.
The doctor estimated roughly 3 weeks to 1-2 months without the insertion of the tube, and likely the tube would at most extend his life maybe months out. Of course, none of this is certain. My father when he was well, always expressed to me that he wanted to extend his life as long as possible, he had a terrible fear of death.
I asked him this question, and he could not make a decision, although I asked if he understood, and he said he did.
My father was a man who experienced very little happiness in his life, one of his greatest hopes, was to become a grand father. As I told him when he was in the hospital, I was about to get married (I am), it brought about the biggest smile in his face, and gave him so much energy. I want him to live to see his grand child, I want him to hold him or her once before he is gone...
I want to make the decision that will most likely make this happen. I also want him to hopefully recover. My mother will be his 24 hour caretaker, and will do the comfort feeding for him. I will also be staying with my parents to help.
I have hopes that my father's swallowing can recover, the doctor said it's possible, but unlikely, and it would be unlikely that he would survive 1-2 years out to see his grandchild. This is likely the case with or without a tube going into his stomach (my father also loves to eat).
The decision reached between myself, my mom, and my aunt, is to not insert the tube. I am having insane doubts and fears of regret. I would happily give years of my life to my father if I could so that he could live a little while longer to see his grandchildren and to experience some happiness in his life.
Thank you for reading this, and thank you for your reply.

"i hope anyone on or coming off Mirtazapine is not suffering. I don't think there is a perfect drug (if they even work). I have my doubts. I must have been on it 10 years. MY Doc didn't run it by me when he put me on it. As my mum had just passed away i doubt i was thinking clearly. I do think doctors can be too quick to hand these things out. I didn't need this for grief. And I don't suffer with depression. Time would have made things better for me. Unfortunately, what eventuated was me being twice my size. i had high BP then. Now I am nearly completely weaned, I have lost 10 kilos and no more high BP. Admittedly, the drug helped me sleep better. But the inertia and the needing 2 hours to recover and wake up before I wanted to move off the sofa were pretty awful. The weight loss has taken a long time but now I wake up and find I am a morning person again and not just a splodge that can't get moving. If I was anyone thinking of taking this, think twice. The weight gain hurts (maybe ladies more so). opt for a pill that doesn't do what MTZ does. IT's BRUTAL!!! Depression is a terrible thing and I just hope folk find what works for them. I'm not unfamiliar with depression so I truly sympathize with anyone suffering this. MY sis had it and it was devastating. She got over it. and she leads a happy productive life now. THERE'S always light at the end of the tunnel.

"Had a week of ups and downs with recovery on the horizon and then snatched away. Feels like i am almost at my optimum dose combination of Sertraline and Mirtazapine but as close as i get to normality, the anxiety them washes me back again. It feels like i am getting caught in a rip tide and i’m being dragged further out to sea each time. If i am going to get back on my surf board and ride to recovery i think i am going to have to make a change. The 30mg Mirtazapine seemsto be doing good but its a very complicated and contradictive medication in terms of its many effects on brain chemicals/hormones.. e.g. serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine histamine, cortisol etc.
I’ve been thinking that the 30mg is too activating and so i’m going to reduce down to 22.5mg and increase the Sertraline from 175mg back to the maximum dose of 200mg. This feels like the last throw of the dice on this medication combination as i have been going up and down the doses on each since November last year. However, despite recovery not lasting, i am in a much better place than i was in November.
This is when you feel so alone and don’t know which way to turn. I speak to my GP and they don’t really know what to do either. Even the psychiatrist seems to be incapable of directing me on an appropriate strategy. This is where social media despite its evils can be such a big help. There are lots of forums like this one where you can talk to people who are going through similar experiences and bounce your ideas off. I also find that helping others is one of the best distractions from your own mental health issues. There is a guy on this forum who has helped me so much and i will seriously owe him a case of beer if this pay dice roll pays off.
The key to any medication or doseage change is to give it time. This is so difficult when you are faced with days of uneasy feelings like you’re going crazy and all manner of symptoms obstruct your day. However, if i can just get back on the board, i might be able to catch that wave again to recovery. Happy surfing to all fellow Serotonin Surfers! Watch this space.....

"This would have to be the most hardest thing i have been through in all my life.
8 weeks ago i started having severe long term side effects of taking 45mg of Mirtazapine, i had been having mild side effects from the mirtazapine over the past 16 months id been on it. I just put it down to anxiety, thinking a least the physical symptoms were easier to manage and didnt even think it was the tablet side effects. I went to my local gp who tampered me down from 45mg to 30mg for a week to 15mg for a week to 7.5mg for a week then nothing. During these weeks i have have been experiencing severe nausea, muscle aches, exhaustion, dizziness, burning sensation through my arms and back, restlessness, agitation body tremors and a pressure in my head and 1 full on panic attack, these withdrawal side effects have been coming in waves intermittently for the duration of the 8 weeks. I have now been off the drug for 9 days it is hell, everyday i wake up and pray for a better day, reassuring myself surely i will have a better day today. I must say the symptoms are lessening and not as severe, but its not easy, i have had to have a family members around me during this hard period for support. The medication i have been on to relieve these symptoms have been Oxazapam 7.5mg when necessary, Maxalon 10mg 3 times a day and Panadol 1000mg 6hrly, These tablets have taken the edge of the symptoms. I have been reading that once you cease Mirtazapine withdrawal symptoms will ease within 2 weeks. I am praying that this is the case as i feel im not ready to go back to work as yet. I would of never touched this toxic drug if id known the side effects to come off it, its created a monster, i was never this symptomatic with my anxiety 24/7 like i am now, i was hoping for a quick fix, when i started this medication, i was having sleeping trouble and anxiety but not as bad or as frequent as now. My gp never explained the withdrawal side effects to me !!
Just hoping if there is anyone out there that can give me some reassurance that this is not going to last for months post not taking the Mirtazapine anymore Thank You

"I was prescribed Mirtazapine 30mg and Escitalopram 5mg for a bout of severe insomnia and the related crippling anxiety, which meant I didn't sleep for nearly 2 weeks. Zopiclone, Diazepam and Phenergen didn't help me sleep and I concede that Mirt was the thing that helped me turn a corner and at least start getting at least a little sleep, starting from 2 weeks ago today.
However the sleep I am getting is extremely fragmented - it takes me 2 or 3 hours to get off but then I wake up literally every 30 mins or so and I wake feeling completely unrefreshed. It feels as though I'm in a dream like light sleep all night. The exception to this is 2 nights I've had where I wake up and immediately know I've had a better sleep... you KNOW when you've been properly asleep... and I then feel significantly better that day. But that has been 2 nights out of 14.
I am convinced that the Mirt is causing this fragmented sleep because it's not the normal kind of insomnia I always have, which is a problem going to sleep. I never have problems with constant waking and I really feel the Mirt is not creating a normal sleep cycle in me. It's been 2 weeks now and it hasn't changed or improved at all and so I want to already try to taper off it because the anxiety is under control (I can feel the Escitalopram kicking in, I am familiar with SSRIs and I know they help me with that) but at the same time I am scared of setting myself back to the previous horrific ""no sleep"" insomnia.
Has anyone else experienced Mirt causing this fragmented constant dream like sleep for them? Am I the only one?

"So I've been on Mirt for about two years now, I was put on it I was having trouble sleeping. Before that I was on citalopram, which I found to be much better for my anxiety but obviously did nothing to help me sleep. I've actually never managed to entirely come off the citalopram as I've found the withdrawal symptoms too much, instead I've just reduced my dosage from a high of 40mg to now a drop every other day...so about 1mg a day. I take 30mg a day of Mirt.
Anyway recently I've started to become a bit unhappy about all the weight gain I've had on Mirtazipine. I don't know how much I've put on as I never weight myself but I've gone from pretty skinny to being a bit chubby. I'm not too bothered about that, I can live with it, but I'm worried about continuing to put on weight. I've recently cut out all sweet sugary things and am in the process of switching to more low fat main meals, but I'm quite limited in what exercise I can do as I have fibromyalgia. And though I can fight the cravings for sweat sugary things living the rest of my life having to watch what I eat and fight cravings doesn't sound very appealing. So I guess my first question is have many people on here managed to lose or at least stabilize their weight whilst staying on Mirt?
And then my other questions are about the possibility of coming off of it. I've read a lot of horror stories and some more positive ones, I understand that different people can have very different experiences coming off this drug. My worry is that because I've had such a hard time coming off citalopram that means I'm also going to have a horrible time coming of Mirtazapine. But does it always work like that? Could it be that it's actually much easier than I imagine with Mirt?
Any answers to those questions or just thoughts or bits of advice would be greatly appreciated!

"Hi everyone. First post here.
I've been on Mirtazapine (Avanza) since November 2015. And Venlafaxine (Effexor) since January 2017.
The Avanza started at 15mg for the first year and is now at 30mg. The Effexor started at 37.5mg, then 75mg and now 150mg. Both taken once daily.
Over the last year, I've gained about 25kg (55lbs) I went from 70kg to 95kg. Due to the never ending hunger. I crave food 24/7. Mostly carbs and sugar. This has caused even more anxiety and depression, due to the obvious weight gain. I can't fit any of my old clothes. I have stomach and back rolls. I feel uncomfortable in my body.
I have tried exercising. Meal replacement shakes. Hunger reduction pills. Nothing will work.
I think Mirtazapine is the problem. Has anyone else experienced this?
Can I stop the Avzana and keep taking Effexor to maintain my mental health and lose weight?

"I've been prescribed Mirtazapine following a bout of severe insomnia that left me hallucinating and very mentally ill. I was suffering from extreme exhaustion and panic etc - uncontrollable shaking and crying.
It's been 4 days of taking 15mg Mirt now and my sleep has somewhat improved - I am now no longer relying on Zopiclone and instead just supplementing with 5mg of melatonin. I am also not shaking and panicking during the day, so there are definite improvements. However in contrast to what a lot of people seem to say, I do not feel like I'm getting a restful sleep on Mirt. It feels as though I am spending 95% of the night in a state of what I can only describe as wakeful dreams. It feels as though I'm not ever getting to a deep relaxation level and instead am spending the whole night having vivid wakeful dreams (i say wakeful because they somehow don't feel the same as normal dreams).
During the daytime I am so tired, all i can mostly do is lie on the sofa with my eyes closed (again, different to what others say, I'm not actually able to sleep during the daytime either). I'm still feeling very weepy all the time, caused I feel by this permanent tiredness and lack of energy.
Is this normal? I realise it has only been 4 days. Does the next day tiredness ease up? Has anyone else experienced not feeling like they have a restful sleep on Mirt, but instead just have a night full of wakeful dreams? Does that tend to improve?
Thanks for any sharing your experiences x

"Hello, I have posted here before, and some of you will remember. I am on my third and last withdrawal from mirt. I was having horrible abdominal cramps from the second attempt, and at the advice of my GI doc went back on 3.75. Within a few days, the abdominal symptoms were gone. However heart rhythm side effects force me to drop them after only a couple of months. I was hoping that the cramps were gone, but I wasn't that fortunate. Slowly, day by day, they returned, along with the normal WD symptoms. It has been over 80 days, and I am back using the heating pad for the pain. If this scenario is in anyway similar to your experience, or that of someone you know, would you please let me know. I know that no two people are the same, but to know that someone gradually had the abdominal cramps go with time, it sure would help with my anxiety / stress / peace of mind. I thank you, David. I first started trying to get off mirt about two years ago, and have been sick from withdrawals / side effects for the whole time, except last November when I went on the 3.75. Also, for anyone reading this, if you are on the Remeron road of hell, I wish you Godspeed in reaching the end!

"Hi all
I have been a part of this forum for a number of years and its been so helpful, so here is my turn to ask...
I have been on Mirt now for about 3 years or so, for anxiety rather than depression. Have moved from 15 - 30 and now on 45mg which I have been on for about 18 months and works really well for me. Over the last 6-8 weeks I have started to realise that when I go to bed, as it kicks in and start to feel drowsy, I have been almost having brain freezes or (not to sound too dramatic) seizures, they last for maybe 1/4 of a second. Almost like that feeling when you are dozing off and then jump. Its getting more noticeable... any ideas anyone? Starting to worry now and my anxiety is pretty much under control, unless when I am really tired or working a bit too hard...

"Hi
i had been on antidepressant meds for many many years, the last one being Prozac. on 15th Feb a psychiatrist stopped 20mg of Prozac and immediately started me on 15mg Mirtazapine . Took for 20 days. During this time my dear brother died. I hit the bottle to try and cope with my loss and I stopped the Mirtazapine at the same time worried about taking alcohol with these. I didnt go back on Mirtazapine at all. I have been without meds for around 3 months and I am experiencing very unpleasant withdrawal. I stopped the Mirtazapine cold turkey. Although I was only on Mirt for 20 days would one expect such withdrawal.
Any comment or view would be so appreciated. I FEEL SO ISOLATED. THANK YOU?

"I've tapered Mirtazapine for about a year from 45mg to 7.5mg. When I got down to 15mg, I split the dose into 2 (7.5mg morn + 7.5mg night) bc this strategy worked well for me tapering Clonazepam 2 years ago. So I cont'd my taper by focusing on my night dose first (cont'd taking 7.5mg morn), and I jumped off my night dose of 2mg on 3/31. I felt great for first few weeks, then withdrawal hit me on 4/21. It wasn't bad but has gradually gotten worse (sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, total lack of focus, etc.) over the last month. Since I have young children, I decided to reinstate my 2mg night dose on 5/26 because I couldn't sleep at all. My question is, how long should I expect to suffer before the withdrawal symptoms dissipate now that I have reinstated? I'm currently 4 days into to reinstating the 2mg dose and I still feel crummy.

"Hi there,
My partner has recently changed rather rapidly from Paroxetine to Mirtazapine and is experiencing the most awful nightmares.
Is this a common side effect or a sign that this medicine should be changed? Any help gratefully received.
I have watched him going through rapid withdrawal under the supervision of a GP and now he seems to live in fear of the dreams he has.
Would be glad to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience.

"My husband is on 1- 30 mg of REMERON at night. He is also on EFFEXER and SEROQUEL. He was in a psychiatric hospital for a month a few months ago. The psychiatrist took him off of the meds he had been on and put him on this . He was having tremors when he went in for which they prescribed Inderal. He has become irritable, aggressive, mean, and nearly intolerable! I think it's the Remeron but not certain. Has anyone else had experiences like this? He is 69 years old.

"Hello, I am looking for some encouragement from fellow mirtazapine users. I know that there are a lot of withdrawal forums but at this point coming off of it is the least of my worries. A little background, I am a 32 female. I suppose I have had anxiety all my life but 3 years ago I had a major episode with health anxiety. long story short I started celexa and in the mean time had multiple tests and all came out good. so after about a month on celexa I was back to myself, or actually better than I was before. fast forward to Feb this year and I had another episode while still on celexa. upped my dose which made it worse then swapped to lexapro. was on lexapro for over 5 weeks and still had no appetite and some sleep issues. psych prescribed mirt. I have been taking it for 11 days now. appetite still has not come back although I can eat a little easier. sleep is okay. but the past 3 days I have become even more depressed. I know with the combo it is probably hard to tell which drug has done what, but I wondered if anyone had worsening depression before getting better. I know they say 6 weeks but the past 3 months have felt like a year and another month of feeling like this seems like forever. sorry if it sounds like I am throwing myself a pity party. i just want to get better like I am sure you all do. I have an appt this Friday coming up but would just like to hear some first hand accounts if possible. thanks in advance.

"Looking for advice and similar experiences. Sertraline 200mg pooped out after 16 years of working brilliantly. with no life event triggers. I am normally a happy go lucky person (as most of us, the last person in a friends group that you predict would suffer from anxiety and depression). Initially, GP recommended through liaison with Mental Health specialist (pysch) to add Mirtazipine as it has a good track record working in combination and complementing with SSRI's (e.g. Sertraline) in kick starting them again.
Since September last year i have been on a roller coaster ride with doseage trial and error and it is completely obvious that my GP is unable to support as they just seem to agree with whatever i state based on my symptoms that i have been tracking through a spreadsheet.
I have been referred by my GP multiple times for an antidepressant medication review with a psych but i keep getting referred to the Wellbeing Team and talk based therapies. I am already undergoing online CBT calls with Wellbeing Team and using the online CBT Silvercloud service. However, despite repeated attempts from my GP to refer me to a Mental health specialist qualified to discuss medication, i am refrerred back to the same wellbeing team through their single point of access. I've now raised a complaint through PALS (Patients and Liaison Service) to intervene and arrange a session for me to meet with a qualified specialist to discuss my medication as i feel like i am going round in circles and the current system / referral process is failing me.
My latest self medication has been to gradually reduce Sertraline and maintain Mirtazipine at 30mg. I am at a point now where i am not sure whether to continue with Sertraline reduction, e.g. move down to 25mg Sertraline or reduce Mirtazipine. The evidence suggests i should reduce the serraline as i had a significant bad reaction for a number of weeks the last time i went below 30mg Mirtazipine so my gut feeling is to reduce sertraline. I have also suffered no signficantly bad reaction at all since reducing from 200mg sertraline through 150, 100, 75 and more recently 50.
I'm thinking of reducing the 50 to 25 this week and then see how i go on 30 Mirt and 25 Sert combined. I get the feeling it's still going to be a while before i get to speak to a pysch on the NHS.
All i can say is thank god i have loving family and friends to support me. God only knows what it must be like to navigate our underfunded / underresourced alone without any support. My GP told me that the triage lisaison decision making progress above is all due to underfunding for mental health support. The quick fix is drug and talk based therapies but you never seem to be able to speak to anyone with a specialist background in medication (e.g. psych)

"Hi everyone. I have been taking mirtazapine for about 5 weeks. After initial grogginess for the first week it has been wonderful for my sleep. However, it is giving me big problems with constipation. I'll spare you the details. I am only on 15 mirt. a day at the moment. If I went up to 30 - my doctor has suggested this as an option, but I've been so enjoying the sleep benefits of 15 - would the constipation side-effect be any less? Any experiences anyone's had around this side-effect, I'd be glad to hear. Otherwise I think I may have to come off mirtazapine, as I couldn't endure the constipation problem continuing long-term. I suppose I could ask the doctor for something long-term against constipation, but I'm loath to start on a second med just to get around the effects of the first.

"Hi, Ive been taking Mirtazapine 30mg and Propanolol 40mg for years, I recently changed to Sertraline 20mg instead of propanolol while still talking my mertazpine 6 weeks ago because I got diagnosed with reyanuds disease. Over the past year Ive noticed a huge decline in my memory and its a bit muggy. My eyesight reaction can be a little slow too, and take a split second to readjust, while sometimes its just ever so slightly blurry.
I was wondering if anyone else has these symptoms? And if after all this time, if they are the cause I should try to come off them

"Hello ,
I started Mirtazapine around 4 weeks ago. I am taking 7.5 mg....I have terrible constipation and grogginess. I am wondering the grogginess goes away? I like to go to the gym in the morning but having a hard time doing so. On a positive note, I was able to get off Lorazepam which I used for sleep for close to 6 years.
I have gaine around 5 pounds, however I was binge eating prior to this drug so I am not going to attribute it totally to Mirtazapine.
If the grogginess continues I might have to get off this drug.

"Hi everyone,
I have been on Remeron for almost 3 years. I never took over 7.5mg per night. I am trying to wean off it. I have gained 30 lbs on this nasty drug. My cholesterol is elevated and I just want off it. I was put on it for anxiety and depression. I started having panic attacks and terrible anxiety which caused the depression. I had lost 25 lbs, my hair was falling out, and I really just thought I was going crazy. The sleep and appetite stimulate was helpful in the beginning, but is now just making me very unhealthy. I really don't think it ever did much for the anxiety and depression. Anyone have any luck with getting off this drug? I am down to 3.75 but suffering from awful nausea and today I had a spell of dizziness. I am also on Lexapro which I will keep for now. I truly wish I could get off all of the psych meds.

"Hi,
I was going through some of my files and noticed that I had put together a compilation of Remeron Withdrawal symptoms from six years ago when I first tried Remeron and went off. I think it helped me relate to what I was going through with what others were going through back six years ago and currently now that I'm once again going through Remeron withdrawals.
The first section is just a list of the symptoms themselves in alphabetical order. The second section are excerpts from people's comments where I think I obtained some of the symptoms for the list.
I'm not sure what web sites these were taken from. Also, we may not know how long someone was on Remeron, at what dose, and whether they tapered or went off cold turkey. And it's possible they were on other medications at the same time which could have compounded their symptoms. We just don't know all the facts. This is just a list for your information only.
Although these symptoms are most likely from withdrawal, if any of them are really uncomfortable or concerning, whether it's actually from withdrawal or something else, talk to your doctor.
If you have any other withdrawal symptoms that you want to add, feel free to reply to this post and add a comment.

I have never felt all of these symptoms at once before. In fact I have never felt some of them at all ever before.”
“I have been on it for two weeks and came off and it has been three weeks and I am still extremely nauseated. It is awful! I definitely think it is withdrawals.”
“I have had the same experience. Headaches, nausea/vomiting, anxiety, motion sickness, severe insomnia, aches etc etc. Have been trying to get off it for years.”
“It's not just my moods (my depression/anxiety had been great before coming off med), I physically feel really sick, been feeling extremely nauseated and last night couldn't sleep because I kept thinking I was going to throw up. Is this a normal reaction coming off mirtazapine?”
“The alternate nights went well although it felt like the 48 hour gap was too long and come 48 hours I was desperate to take my tablet. During the week where I completely stopped, I was incredibly tired, irritable, tearful, drowsey and generally felt awful. ”
“Stopped mirtazapine a week ago now after reducing over a month,and I too have gone through hell with withdrawal symptons. Bad anxiety, sweating, shaking, feeling sick, I feel just as bad as I did before I went on them 7 months ago. ”
“I haven't put my prescription in on time I have gone through the most agonising hell of withdrawal symptoms. I can't sleep. I feel anxious. I have panic attacks. I have a weird feeling like I'm going to have some kind of a fit. My head feels like it's got a clamp around the back of it. My head pricks. I feel wired like after you've taken crack. I feel sick. I can't eat. My stomach gets upset. I'm shaky. ”
“Like alot of other people for me the worst thing was insominia and to be honest that hasnt improved and I've been on and off sleeping tablets in an effort to establish a new sleep pattern. I was also getting really viloent and long lasting panic attacks as well as deep depression, to the point where I couldn't function. but as I said eventually it got back to my normal state. ”
“I found this post, because I also have been getting some bad side effects coming off the Mirtazapine, Mainly Anxiety, and panic attacks, I even experinced some heart palpitations, which i mentioned to my doctor. ”
“I went 'cold turkey' from Mirtazapine and, although it is a bloody horrible experience including extreme anxiety, uncontrollable tearfulness, inability to sleep and generally feeling crap... ”
“Yes, trying to stop them, the withdrawals are horrendous for me. I feel sick, shaky, disconnected, and anxious, all in all a total mess! ”
“Feeling dizzy terrible anxiety numbness in my body especially in bed at night.Vivid dreams cant relax blurred vision ringing in the ears and a total feeling of being disconnected and the insomnia is terrible…”
“I decided that I am 2 weeks in withdrawal so go for it, I am now at the end of my 3rd week, and what a bad time I had at the weekend, hot sweats, intensive anxiety, feeling sick all the time, not sleeping right, tied during the day, head aches and so drowsy also my eye twitches. ”
“First time inadvertently stopping it only after 2 months on it at 7.5 mg! The withdrawal was horrible! 24-hr nausea, cold-hot alternation, intense fear and anxiety and yes, no sleep more than 1-2 hours at a time. Eating was out of question. Interesting detail: withdrawals don't start until 8-10 days after the last dose and peak around 3-4 weeks.Symptoms: disrupted sleep (don't feel tired at night, wake up early from back pain,), gnawing incapacitating back pain (right below the shoulder blades), fron ribs pain, belly aches, random dumping (sweating, nausea, diarrea after eating), throat spasms, stomach spasms, sore throat, nausea (with or without food), dizziness, crawling side of the head or parts of body, cold/sweating, nightmares, anxiety, hypochondria, rage, irritability, the full monty. ”
“....had some weird side-effects including gum boils (?) and cramp-like spasms in my stomach.....but tip-toeing thru reasonably ok (i think) was alarmed to read the last post by potap 75 who highlighted the unknown (to me anyway) fact ""withdrawals don't start until 8-10 days after the last dose and peak around 3-4 weeks"" getting really nervous about this ! ”
“me 3-4 weeks are at it's worst, almost unbearable. Anxiety, fear, but especially gastro symptoms remind me about my surgeries and suffering. ”
“but every time I try to reduce/come off them I end up tearful, anxious, angry, scared & ultimately back to square 1 (or square 45!) Physically my appetite has decreased dramatically, I've had some killer headaches, backache & feel like I have low grade flu. ”
“Here I am a month later. I successfully tapered to 5.4mg the month before and now I'm 3 weeks after the next reduction - to 3.8 mg. I'm absolutely dying! Tremendous pressure and spasms in my upper stomach and chest, nausea, zero appetite, can't eat anything without sweating and getting more nauseous. Dizziness, cold and hot flushes. Skin crawling on the back of my head. Tremors, breathing shallow, twitching eyes.And yes, this time - insomnia. The nausea wakes me up at 3:30 am and that's it. Can't work, can't exercise. So the anxiety and panic are tremendous.I keep pacing outside again and everyone keeps telling me that it's withdrawal again, but in panic I just can't believe it and picture the worst case scenarios. I was actually feeling quite good just 3 days ago, eating whatever I like, exercising in the gym, playing with my kids, doing yard work etc. But starting exactly 1 week after the reduction, my symptoms were gradually getting worse and worse until finally they hit me like a ton of bricks yesterday at work. First I thought I had a cold (both kids were sick), but then I realized it's something else as it was getting worse. ”
“My killer symptom has been right sided stomach pain, resembling my previous gallbladder surgery. But then again - the runs, nausea, tremendous tension and anxiety, spinning head, feelings of doom and hopelesness. Sweating/cold and have I said ""nausea""? Funny thing, again the first week or 10 days felt great: so much optimism, strength and clarity and then exactly 8 days into it - BOOOOOM! ”
“I can't get to sleep at night and the adrenaline pumps through my body all night long. Loss of appetite, nausea, neck and back pain, headaches, fear, anxiety, exhaustion, hot and cold flushes, a constant sick feeling in my stomach like something terrible is about to happen and the this list goes on........ ”
“I was taking 15mg but only for 2 weeks. I decided to stop taking them altogether 4 days ago, and now i feel like crap! Really bad stomach problems. ”
“The first 4 days were very unpleasant, sweating, shaking, twitching, extreme anxiety and nausea to name just some of the effects, so please dont take the decision lightly to come off them cold turkey…”
“I've had the most horrendous time. At first I thought I had picked up a really bad virus or something (until I started reading of other people's experiences). I've had constant waves of nausea, feeling light-headed and like I'm going to faint, hot and cold flushes, extreme exhaustion (yet an inability to sleep). The anxiety has got progressively worse and I am crying all of the time and without any control over it (like randomly in a shop queue). I can't remember a time when I ever felt this wretched.”

"Anyone believe they experienced Remeron interdose withdrawals?
I believe I have.... as I'm experiencing the intensity of some of my withdrawal symptoms, some of them remind me of how I sometimes felt in the late afternoon or evening.... Made me wonder if this was interdose withdrawals. I read a post somewhere where a guy would have random anxiety about the same time in the afternoon. So he split his dose to morning and evening and the anxiety lessened. I think he spit it up even more and the anxiety was gone.
I had only been taking 7.5mg and wonder if it just wasn't enough to build it up in my system enough to make it stable? I also take glutathione (body's own master antioxidant) which I wonder if that caused the liver to metabolize Remeron faster than normal?
Things that make me go hmmmmm.
I guess the whole interdose theory doesn't matter much now that I'm completely off Remeron but it does possibly help explain some of the craziness that I went through while on Remeron.

I've read where some people feel tired as part of withdrawal. I'm about two weeks off Remeron and have gone through a variety of symptoms.
Now I'm feeling really tires, almost sedated like feeling? Anyone else get that? I actually slept ok but just feel like I've taken a sleeping pill but didn't.
I'm also having waves of stimulation where my armpits sweat, legs and arms feel weak, it's not low blood sugar as I checked and was fine.... yet eating kinda helps. This happens after breakfast but before lunch. I definitely feel like my nervous system is overly sensitive. I don't feel mental anxiety but my body says otherwise.

"Hi,
I know many mention having nausea even severe nausea with withdrawal.
I've been off Remeron for 8 days know.
I've had waves of nausea but also waves of a more strong nausea/malaise that makes me feel hopeless and feelings of despair. Similar feeling I'd get with a flu bug and the moments leading up to throwing up is the worst. Strong feelings of hopelessness/despair. Not sure what causes that but I've it has to do with neurotransmitter and inflammation.... I guess they are involved in the throwing up process. Anyway, when I had the flu and would
throw up the hopelessness/despair feelings would lift and I'd feel immediate relief and joy and hope.
Anyway, the nausea/malasie feelings I'm getting now are similar but I have no desire to throw up. Just and off and on again feeling of nausea and malaise like I have the flu then it goes away...
And the funny thing is no matter how mad this feels I actually have an appetite and can eat. Some times I have to push myself a little but....Anyone else can eat when feeling like this?
Also, what has helped you with the nausea ill feelings? I see some
people take Zofran. I have some
and can help but not always. What has been your experience? Ginger? Heat pad?

I was prescribed 30mg of Mirtazapine 4 weeks ago for anxiety and depression. I'm 33 and never taken antidepressants before now, and my doctor recommended Mirtazapine as he said they’d help with my early waking too. I was falling asleep fine but waking up after only a few hours and unable to get back to sleep, meaning I was constantly shattered which exacerbated the anxiety and low mood.
Anyway, as soon as I started taking the 30mg, they knocked me out I started to actually sleep through the night which was amazing. I started to feel slightly better straight away, whether that was the sleep or the drugs starting to take effect, I don’t know.
After 3 weeks, the sedative effect seems to have completely stopped. For the last week, I’ve been struggling to fall and stay asleep, which is once again exacerbating the depression and anxiety. Is this normal? I’ve read that Mirtazapine’s sedative effect is better in lower doses, does this mean my sleep won’t get much better on 30mg?
In those first 3 weeks when it was knocking me out at night, I realised just how important sleep is for the mood and general wellbeing. I had a great 3 weeks on Mirtazapine but now feeling like I’m back where I started – shattered, anxious and low.
I’m hoping it’s just a blip and it’s my body adjusting to the drug. Has anyone else experienced this?
Cheers!

"hi,
i was wondering if anyone experiencing the following:
i noticed after i tapered down from 15mg of mirt to 11.25mg i felt better for a few days. i was sleeping better, my anxiety and irrational fears decreased. However, that lasted 4 days and im back to not being able to sleep, feeling anxious and not like myself. Don't know if i should taper down some more.
ive also experienced dry mouth, night sweats, chills, agitation, restlessness, changes in appetite, unable to focus or think or remember things.

"hello all,
i have been on mirtazipine for almost 5 weeks to help with sleep. i originally started on 7.5mg, but after 7 days, I increased my dosage to 15mg per doctor's order i was on 15mg for almost 3 weeks. By the end of the 4th week, I noticed my anxiety symptoms get worse and i was only sleeping 4 hours at most. I decided to taper off the meds. i've been on 11.25 for 4 days now. As of yesterday, ive experienced diarrhea, no appetite, a headache (that went away). I don't know if these are WD symptoms or stomach virus. I will say since reducing my dosage, i have gotten more sleep and my anxiety has gone down. Today i feel a littlw brain fog and detached. i am really sensitive to meds, and i am SUPER scared of the WD symptoms especially the hallucinations and mania.
i noticed too that when i'm driving or walking by a pole or a mailbox, from the corner of my eye i think its a person, but then i turn to notice it was just that a pole or a mailbox. i dont know if im being paranoid or if im hallucinating. Has this happened to anyone?
any advice you can give me for tapering off mirt will be greatly appreciated.

"I have put on nearly 1 and a half stone since being prescribed Mirtazapine . This is combined with an insatiable desire for sweet foods and carbs, which I have never experienced before. Can anyone tell me how long it may take to experience weight loss ( I am tiny - 150 cms and usually a size 6 - 8) and usually eat healthily. Despite upping my exercise routine, I have also experienced total lethargy. I am hoping this will disappear too. Would just like to know how quickly I might see some positive results

"Hi all,
I had been on 45mg Mirtazapine per day for over 10 years as it was great for helping my diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder. I decided to stop now due to always being tired and mainly the weight gain, so I wanted to see if I get some weight loss by stopping. I am a 54 year old male, my weight is about 13 stone, and I am 6'1 tall. I don't look over weight but the belly fat is just too annoying and does not help when breathing while sitting down. So I thought enough is enough and no diets had worked due to powerful cravings for cake, sweets and junk.
I felt good and ready to stop the Mirtazapine ie I felt ready! I looked into it and read other peoples experiences and I got to be honest it scared the life out of me from what I was reading with regards to Mirtazapine withdrawal. My advice DON'T! As it will only put the unnecessary fear into you Yes of course everyone is different, but go by how you feel and not by how others feel as you know your own body feelings!
I went for the tapering off method but the method was mine that I think has worked for me well fingers crossed.
This is what I done if you can call it tapering:
January 30th 2019
I dropped the dose from 45mg to 30mg. This gave me stomach upset diarrhea that lasted 24 hours then all was good, Could not sleep and also vivid dreams but also more energy lasted only about 3 days the sleep problems that is.
February 23rd 2019
I dropped the dose from 30mg down to 22.5mg per day. My sleep was normal but I did notice a bit of anxiety and internal tremors but I knew what the cause was so I just enjoyed the ride so to speak and within a few days the tremors stopped but still had some anxiety and to be honest I have anxiety anyway which Ive just got used to over the years. I also had a feeling of being proud of myself for coming off Mirtazapine.
March 4th 2019
I dropped from 22.5mg down to 7.5mg per day. I had a moment of anxiety and detachment so I took half of dose of 5mg Diazepam and I was fine. Things generally improved....

March 15th and 16th 2019 I took NO Mirtazapine and felt great well normal.

March 17th 2019  Stopped completely  and the date of writing this is the 23rd March 2019 and I feel fine slightly anxious but I am anyway but its manageable  because I feel uplifted being able to stop Mirtazapine. Yes still early days but the withdrawals did not seem as bad as people have written which is why I said earlier go by your own accounts / feelings and not what others have experienced. Just follow and listen to your own body as your the expert of your feelings. For me using Mirtazapine for well over 10 years on highest dose 45mg per day' I don't think Ive done to bad coming off!

My last comment is my belly fat is feeling softer so I guess its a sign of starting to loose the weight :) 

Yay HAPPY DAYS with a dose of Anxiety lol.

"Can any of you who have taken Mirtazapine tell me if they have problems with very dry skin? My skin is so dry on the palm side of my fingers that it is flaking. I am also getting small fissures in the skin where they are bleeding they are so dry. I was only on Mirtazapine for 19 days. I was taking it for anxiety insomnia and was told to take 7.5mg the first 4 nights and then go up to 15mg. I stayed at 7.5mg because I was afraid to increase the dose as long as it was putting me to sleep. However, it stopped working after 5 days and so I stayed on 7.5mg until I saw my doctor a couple days later. He insisted I go up to 15mg but after 3 days on that dosage, I couldn't take the side effects anymore. I could hardly get out of bed and go to work I was so tired. So I went back down to 7.5mg for three days and then the last 4 nights I took 3.75mg. It's difficult to cut the pill any smaller so last night was my last night on it. I hope the withdrawal isn't too bad seeing as how I only took small doses for 19 days.

"(Long story ahead)
i suffer with seasonal depression every year. As well as anorexia and emetephobia but these are other stories.
One year the depression wasnt letting go, spring came then summer and it was still just as bad so i bit the bullet and asked for some anti D's. i had tried sertraline in the past and i didnt get on with it very well plus the emetephobia scared me into trying anything. The doctor raved about how good mirt was and that i would doubly benefit from it as it is well known to put weight on, as well as the antiemetic properties it poses.
I was told everything i wanted hear, i thought great lets give them a go.
i started on 7.5mg and it knocked me clean out, but i had no negative side effects other than sleeping well. iv never had any issues with sleep so it was a bit of a pain that i was sleeping for so long but i felt fine when i woke. i took this for a few days then started the 15mg that was initially prescribed by the gp after a week or so i felt great really positive and full of life again note i did not have an increase in appitite though. after about two more weeks i crashed again full of anxiety and doom and gloom doctors orders was to up to 30mg so i did and again had about two weeks of feeling almost euphoria then crashed again, hard. doctors order was to up to 45mg, im pretty sure you get the picture by this point.
45mg was hell after the two weeks of positivitiy. i was having panic attacks daily, the sleep effect wore off and for the first time in my life i was suffering with insomnia. i was feeling sick every day, i lost a further 3 stone (i was only 8 stone to begin with) i developed allergies to almost everything which was somthing i never had issues with before. i was a mess. i knew i needed to come of this and fast!
i read so many horror stories about withdrawing so i took everyones advice and tried the 10% taper. this is still hell!
iv managed to get down to 30mg and i honestly dont know how much mroe i can go.
i feel awful, i cant eat, cant sleep, my work is effected, my relationship is effected.
i feel sick constently, which in turn sets of my anxiety.
what else can i possibly so to get off this awful drug?! help please!

"Hi guys I have been on Mirtazapine for the last couple of months mostly for insomnia. Firstly I was on 15mg at night which helped keep me asleep for at least 5 hours before waking. My doctor thought I would benefit by upping the dose to 30mg but since then I've not slept as well. I seem to find that dose mentally stimulating -not helpful before bedtime. And that dose actually seems to increase my anxiety a little too. Do some of you find 15mg much more sedating than 30mg like I do? And should I try the 15mg again? Thanks.

"Hello,
I guess I've just come here for peace of mind and a chat really. I have been lowering my doses for the last month and a half however the past week or so I had a very bad infection in my tooth, i was prescribed lots of antibiotics and painkillers and i was in so much pain having to work at the same time and taking mirtz was the last thing on my mind.
Anyway I've been having some pretty awful withdrawal symptoms the last 3 days or so loss of appetite, I've been extremely nauseous (but not sick) and my anxiety/mood has been awful.
I'm now unsure of taking the tablet again? should I just push through this? will i ever be the same again?
I will try and get in an appointment with my GP as soon as i can but i don't want to go back on it and have to experience this all over again?
thank you any advice would be great (im super health anxious so please dont frighten me haha)

"I am having several issues with Mirt. and would love some feedback.
I started on a combo of 30 Mirt/75 Effexor at the beginning of November and it worked great. It pulled me out of a longtime depression and gave me my life back. The only problem was constant and untouchable hunger! I also gained some weight, as many do on Mirt. I can accept the extra pounds, but the hunger has just been really hard to deal with.
So I tried to go down on the Mirt. and switch to Wellbutrin mid January (while keeping the Effexor in place). I went down to 15mg for 2 weeks and felt fine. That gave me the confidence to go to 15mg every other night. The plan was I would do that for 2 weeks then switch to 150mg of Wellbutrin. This has all been done with a Pdoc that I really like, by the way. The problem is that after a week on the 15mg Mirt. every other night, the depression came back, so I was left with a choice: ride out the depression over the next week on the low dose of Mirt. so I could make the switch to Wellbutrin or go back up on the Mirt. to regain my stability for a while before trying again (hopefully with a plan to make the switch to Wellbutrin more quickly). After feeling so good after feeling so bad for so long, I decided that stability was most important for now, so I went back up to 15Mg Mirt. every night. Well, after a week of that, my depression was still as bad, so on Sunday, my Pdoc had me go back to the 30mg. It has only been two days, but I am still depressed today and am just worried that whatever effect the Mirt. had before is somehow lost.
SO! After that longwinded backstory, these are my questions:
Is it possible for the Mirt. to just stop working or not be as effective this time around? And how long should I give it before I know?
If it does start to work as well as before, but the hunger persists: Is there any truth to the idea that the hunger isn't as bad at the higher doses? I have also heard some people say that the hunger lessened for them after a few months. Has anyone experienced that?
Has anyone taken both Mirt. and Wellbutrin? Did you find one to be better than the other?
Thank you all in advance!

"I was taking mirt for about 3 months, 15mg per day. then about 2 months ago the dr upped it to 30mg. I started having seizures and severe panic attacks, couldnt eat of sleep, nightmares and tremors and a bunch of other terrible things. We found out that the mirt gave me something called serotonin syndrom, so the dr said to stop taking it immediately. I started taking benedryl as per the dr orders, 75mg at night to help with sleep - one of my other meds keeps me from sleeping. it seemed to be making me more nauseaus so i stopped taking that and tried a natural approach, a herbal supplement sleep aid with meletonin, valerian root, hops and a few other things. It sees to work good so far but i am still so sick feeling. I havent been able to eat solid food for days. I am able to drink a boost shake so i can take other medicines but just barely. I am also having some depression and discouragement, and constant worry.
Has anyone had symptoms like this? Any way to make the side affects not as bad, at least to the point that i can eat something? I cannot go back on the med but i dont know how much more of this i can take.****

"I dont want to write everything here so I'm just going to give a summary. I was recently bumped from 15mg to 30mg of mirtazapine, been taking for a month now for low mood, depression, poor apetite, and lack of proper sleep. Ive had vivid, bizarre dreams every single night since taking mirtazapine but they don't bother me much. I'd say around 10% of my dreams are in the nightmare category, but not overwhelming.
The first night of me taking 30mg, I felt several things that were wrong. While trying to fall asleep, the very first thing i noticed was that my right leg wouldnt stop having ""compulsions"" to move, also known as restless leg. I eventually get tired of fighting it and stay up a bit longer. The restless leg completely stopped after I told myself I was going to stay up and did stay up an extra 30-45 minutes. While trying to fall asleep the second time, i kept feeling these sharp pains in my right ear (which i cant hear out of currently since i made a mistake of using a Q-tip to clean out my ear and ended up pushing the earwax even farther in) that eventually stopped, but then whole parts of the right side of my body would start having these pains. I ended up being able to ignore these pains and fell asleep.
I had some pretty normal dreams at first (i think, don't remember), until i was randomly sort of ""teleported"" into an old middle school math classroom from my childhood. I knew instantly I was not in reality, that I was in a dream of some sort. I tried desperately to take myself out of the dream, which is an easy task to do normally, but every attempt failed at every point i tried it in until the end. During that lucid dream, I had no control over what was happening like i normally have when dreaming, I was not able to wake myself up and eventually I came to the conclusion that I was either dead or sent back in time. I woke up from what felt like being trapped in a lucid-nightmare-coma dream for hours.
I'm not going to go in-depth about what happened in the nightmare, all I want to know is if this has happened to anyone else? I normally have perfect control over my dreams and know how/when to wake up, but after being bumped up to 30mg for a SINGLE night, that control was taken away and experienced being stuck in a lucid nightmare.

"Hi Everyone
I was wondering if anyone could help or reassure me...
I was on 30mg of mirtazapine for approx. 4 years for anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. In those 4 years, this drug wrecked havoc on my body:
Gained 70 pounds
Developed GERD
Developed a food allergy (oddly enough)
Had a serious difficulty (if not an impossibility) losing weight
Had digestive issues
Back in September, I decided to taper off mirtazapine because I wanted to try to get pregnant in a year and I figured that the damage this medicine was doing was not worth it anymore. So my tapering off began October 3rd (every 12 or so days, I went from 26.25mg --> 22.5mg --> 18.75mg --> 15mg --> 11.25mg --> 7.5mg --> 3.75mg --> 0mg which ended December 25th.
I barely had any noticeable side effects or withdrawal symptoms during the tapering. Very light dizziness on the days I made each switch, light anxiety sprinkled throughout the entire 3 month process.
I am currently on day 23 of not taking mirtazapine and I have been feeling TERRIBLE. Severe waves of anxiety, panic at night, racing negative thoughts, zero appetite, very foggy memory, inability to focus as well as I used to, and feeling depressed and rather hopeless.
I guess I'm just wondering if anyone here went through a process similar to mine and started having withdrawals AFTER completely tapering off mirtazapine and how long it lasted for you? I read one comment saying that the withdrawal effects peak at the 3-4 week mark but I curious if that was while tapering off, stopping cold turkey, or just being off mirtazapine after tapering??
I'm scared that these horrible feelings will last forever.

"Hello all,
First off, I have been taking MIRTAZAPINE since JULY 2017 - so in the region of 17months. I was put on 45mg with DIAZEPAM but then dropped to 30mg not long after. It was due to PTSD, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, SLEEP ISSUES and a state of extreme paranoia and mania. Also recieved psychiatrist help, cognitive therapy and crisis team.
The combination seemed to help me out with sleep almost immediately and from then on in my mood stabalised. Still had moments of paranoia and feeling low, but all in all it helped with the rest and I no longer had the urge to try and kill myself. I have virtually knocked caffeine and alcohol on the head. I could count on one hand the times I've consumed either since starting mirt, the times I had caffeine I would start feeling anxious and alcohol made me way too drunk and either paranoia or depression would sneek in. Anyhow, for a solid 12months now with a positive mindset I've managed to get myself in a happy place and a great state of mind so I feel ready to withdraw and work on becoming drug free and trying to live a relatively normal and sane life again.
After discussing with my doctor he agreed. However my lifelong GP has retired, so this is a new one. He told me to take 15mg for 10 days, then 15mg every other day for 10 days and then to stop. So basically he gave me a 20day withdrawal plan!! I expressed my concern, I told him I missed 5 days due to a perscription error and I went absolutely do-lally. I virtually went that paranoid and confused I had no idea what was going on and I started getting tingly hands and it felt like my brain was jittering, really bad pain behind my eyes. I couldnt sleep and I felt like I had flu. I dont exaggerate my ilness either, it was really bad.
He told me not to worry and that his instructions were good enough to follow as the discontinuation effects of mirtazapine would not be that drastic following the above taper. I still expressed concern and managed to get 28 days supply of 15mg.
My own plan would have been to drop to 22.5mg and take those for 8 weeks then drop to 15mg and take those for 8 weeks then keep dropping as low as possible over the longer periods.
Day 2 of 30mg to 15mg and I just feel a lot more tired and have a bad head. I'm on a healthy nutritious diet, multiple vitamins, plenty of water and I have ordered some CBD oil.
Anyone have any advice on the 30mg - 15mg taper and what worked for you?? Or what didnt work for you??
Thanks

"Been taking 15 mg of mirtazapine for six months. Made me sleep but then stopped working. Went to see the doctor three weeks ago who told me to just stop taking it I wouldn't have any problems coming off it.I feel awful shaky teary no appetite I don't know what is going on. Just wish I had heard of this site before. The doctor assured me I would be fine just stopping it but I certainly feel a long way from being fine. Just don't know which way to turn for the best. I don't want to keep feeling like this I know that.

"I have been on mirtazapine for over ten years which has been working to a degree in helping with panic disorder. Over the last 12 months panic has got back out of control. Finally doctor has agreed to change to Agomelatine
I am reducing mirtazine 30mg 5 days, 15mg 5 days then stop. Start Agomaelatine straight away.
I am up to about end of 15 mg and decided to half to 7.5mg which ive done for 2 days.
I seem to be having severe panic and nausea, gut and back pains- which isnt uncommon as these are the symptoms i usually get but feel it is worsening.
Is this likely to be mirtazapine withdrawal and is there anything i can do to help get rid of these symptoms.
I do have a prescription to Alepam 15mb but have been avoiding using it due to addictive nature but it looks like I might not have a lot of choice.

"Hi Everyone,
I have been taking Mirtazapine since October 18. Started on 15mg, increased to 30mg a week later and last week my psychiatrist increased it again to 45mg.
I am now a week into 45mg, first couple of days were fine, no horrible side effects, just blissful sleep however over the past 3 days my anxiety has been off the charts, I have OCD so my intrusive thoughts have been truly awful.
Can anyone shed any positive light on this increased anxiety, is it a common side effect that will pass??
Many thanks

I was taking the Actavis brand for a month but the last script I got a different box and the pills are made by Genesis pharmaceuticals but from day 1 they don't seem to be working.

"I am a 29 y/o guy and was on Mirt for around 8 months for a bout of anxiety and depression (the last 2 months I was coming off them). They helped me out of the hole I was in but during that time I gained around 15 kg (33 lbs). I am very active running most days and playing sport 3 days a week so this was a horrible thing to happen. I came off the Mirt because of the weight gain and found I felt much better off them anyway.
I have been off them for around 6 months and have not lost any of the weight I gained.
I have been more active since coming off and eating well and have even cut out alcohol for the last month and still no weight has come off.
Please help
Has anyone experienced anything similar?
Did you eventually lose the weight?
Do I just need to give my body more time to get back to normal?
This is really f*****g disheartening, any advice is very much appreciated.

"Hi!
I was on Mirtazapine 4 approximately 14 years and have been off it now for 19 1/2 months and am still suffering horrendously with the following symptoms: chronic insomnia (can go for 4-5 nights and days without any sleep then may get a couple of hours of very broken sleep and then back to no sleep), burning, tingling, numbness throughout out body, burning brain, adrenaline surges, vibrations throughout body and brain, myoclonic jerks, extreme exhaustion/fatigue, depersonalization/derealization, hearing loss, heart palpitations, panic attacks and the list goes on. I was also taking Seroquel for 4 years (off for 2 1/2 years), Gabapentin for 14 years (off for 3 1/2 years) and Zoplicone for 7 months (off for 3 1/2 years). I slow tapered off all these poisons, however due to the fact I'm very paradoxical 2 antihistamines and both Seroquel and Remeron have strong antihistamine qualities, I jumped off the last little bit of both of them but not at the same time.
Is it normal 2 b still suffering so horrendously after being totally off all psych poisons for so long. My G.P. and wonderful herbalist say yes and I have seen many others on the message boards that r going through the same suffering I am. It is totally debilitating, painful and horrendous to have to suffer like this 4 so long. I'm all alone and have no one 2 help me with anything. I also suffer from hypothyroidism, adrenaline exhaustion, have cataracts on both eyes which will be removed by the 7th of February 2019, have had 2 basil cell carcinomas removed from my head last September and have recently been diagnosed with a left branch bundle block in my heart and don't know at this point the severity of it as I'm scheduled to c a Caardiologist but haven't got a date yet.
Please, I desperately need some reassurance that this is still normal for w/d from Mirtazapine after being on it for so long.
If there is anyone that has gone through this as severely as I have and would b willing to either do a Facebook messenger video chat or phone chat, please let me know. I also have free long distance in Canada and United States so if u could p.m. me your number I could call u and the call would be free.
Sorry for the long post. I am desperate 2 get well but feel this will never end.

"Hello all
Like a lot of you I was prescribed mirtazapine for my insomnia and wow was it effective.
However I've never been too keen on being medicated for too long, and thought I was improving my mental health through regular psychotherapy, with the doctor who would prescribe me the mirt.
I also didn't like how the drug made me drowsy and I think dampened my thinking just subtlety, but enough to feel like I wasn't my true self, even though my true self would sometimes consist of anxiety and depression.
Admittedly the drowsiness did subside over time (I've been on mirt for 11 months), but I really wanted to try ridding it of my system, to see how I would go without it, and with my own natural body rhythms to guide me and to work with.
So, after first attempting to come off 15mg with a short 2 week tapering I felt like I was going to explode basically. I tried to sit it out but only lasted 2 days of this hell before popping one back in the system. To instant relief!
So, I had a new respect for this stuff and vowed to stay on it for the time being.
That was a couple months ago. Now here I am again. A lot slower tapering but at the cusp I think of pushing ahead or going back on the low dose.
I write this late at night. Can't see myself sleeping anytime soon but not sure how I'll go. One thing I do like is having that clarity back. However I realise the lack of sleep is a problem.
I might try getting some melatonin. Has anyone tried CBD (hemp) oil and had success for insomnia?
Appreciate you taking the time to read this

"I keep reading where people set expectations where everyone will have the same or similar experience in taking or withdrawing from Mirtazapine, or any AD, or really any pharmaseutical.
As convenient as that might make things, we are NOT all cookie cutter! We all metabolize (liver) quite differently, which essentially means whether or not a drug is compatible with you or could actually harm you.
Enter DNA Pharmacogenetic testing.
I realize many here are based in Europe or UK, but in the US, DNA testing for nearly every type of drug is now available and being used by providers prior to prescribing, even insurance companies are covering it.. It's also available customer direct where no provider involvement is necessary and at a affordable cost.
Educate yourselves, and take control of your health! In just a few short years we will all be shocked and appalled we allowed our providers to dish out these pharms to us using nothing but guess work and viewing us all as cookie cutter.
GOOGLE ""DNA Pharmacogenetics"", there are several companies that provide it direct to customer worldwide at an affordable cost.

"I reduced my dosage from 7.5mg to 3.75 three weeks ago. I felt relatively OK w that cut, sleep hasn’t been as good, had some anxiety for a few days. But now, sleep has been getting bad for the last few days, really bad insomnia! Some nights only 2 hours sleep, but that seems to be getting slightly better.
However, today is the first day of feeling bad during the day as well: depressed mood and horrible anxiety and restlessness. Can’t focus, brain isn’t clear and can’t seem to calm down. The same feelings I had when I first made the cut.
Is it normal for withdrawals to ramp up like this, weeks after a cut? How long should they last for? Anything I can do to help them? I’m taking magnesium glycinate.
Also, I’m cutting a dissolvable 15mg tablet into 4 pieces. The quartered chunks can be irregular in size, some are bigger, some are smaller. Could these variations in size be causing these symptoms as well?

Along with feeling like it wasnt helping anymore i went to the doctors and was prescribed a Beta blocker called Propranolol for anxiety. They have helped my anxiety MASSIVELY.. i was taking them for a week without any symptoms or aide affects until the 2nd week, when i got up on a morning and was just randomely being sick. after that, its happened 2 other days and today ive been ill keep getting hot sweats then running to the toilet to be sick. its completely random times & when i havent even ate anything. Question is.. am i withdrawing from mirtazapine thats making me sick or is it the new tablets? anyone had a similar experience? ive been on quite a few different meds over the last few years & never had symptoms of being sick.

"Hi! I was on Mirtazapine for 14 years and have been off it for 18 months now and am still having horrendous w/d symptoms almost 24/7. The symptoms I'm still having r: chronic insomnia (no sleep most nights and days sometimes for several weeks at a time), burning, tingling, numbness throughout body and head, vibrations throughout body and head, burning brain, adrenaline surges, blurry vision (could be from cataracts on both eyes scheduled to b removed at the end of January 2019), chronic exhaustion and fatigue, hearing loss, myoclonic jerks, panicky, jittery, and the list goes on.
I also suffer from hypothyroidism/hashimotos disease, adrenal exhaustion, am still recovering from cancerurgery I had just over 2 months ago to remove a basal cell carcinoma from my head and one on my ear and a skin graft and believe I've had a big set back from the anesthitc they gave me (propanothol)?, Fentynal 1 shot and 1 shot of an antibiotic.

"My son has been taking Mirtazapine for about 5 years. Last November he had an episode of needing the toilet urgently whilst on the way to work. I had to turn the car around and go back home. Since then it has escalated and now it's not just needing a wee, it's needing a poo. Most of the time he is okay if he has a lift with me but cannot now get a bus or even a taxi because if this feeling comes on, he can't get to a toilet. A few months after the first episode he was suspicious himself that the Mirt might be causing it. His GP dropped him from 40mg to 30, which I now know is too large a reduction. His toilet anxiety has got worse and he says he feels anxious all the time, so he has upped his dose to 40 again. I am convinced, since reading other people's experience, that the Mirt is the cause of it all. GPs don't seem to understand how to reduce these medications. My next problem is how to approach him about this. His fear of full depression coming back is so terrifying that I think he might not even listen to me. Any advice would be appreciated.

"Hi! I was on Mirt 7,5mg for 4 months taken in the evening. For the first month it was great and my sleep and anxiety was in check. Then I started having random adrenaline releases, panic attacks and a feeling of having little emotion - however on the flip side I would sometimes have extreme anger. When people started asking why I had become very quiet, I decided to stop taking Mirt. This was exactly 8 weeks ago. I only tapered at half the dose for one week then stopped completely.
Since stopping the first 2 weeks were great as I had become more alive, but since then I have had all sorts of problems that are random and come on at random times. For example I can feel good for 2-3 days then I have 2 days where I get blood pressure spikes (avg. 140/100), nausea, vertigo/dizziness, tight chest and jaw, random positioned muscle spasms, upset stomach, head pain stabs (lasts less than 3 seconds), feeling of crawling on head and of course anxiety/panic. However, I'm not sure if anxiety is causing the psychosomatic symptoms or the symptoms cause the anxiety. It's a bit of chicken and egg. The strange thing from all of this is that my heart rate does not increase - if anything my heart rate has been lower in the 50-65bmp range, but most likely because I'm sitting around most of the time. Keep in mind I'm unfit with no training for 6 years. Each time I have an episode, I literally feel like I will pass out and die. Again, all pointing to common anxiety/panic symptoms. But you know the physical side feels real. I have randomly been taking 0,5mg of Lorazepam in emergencies, but I'm also clean of this longer term.
My quality of life has diminished rapidly and my doctor has said I should've stayed on this med long term but also denies I could be having side effects. I've lost all trust in my doctor and now trying to go completely natural in my recovery. 12 years fighting anxiety has taken its toll.
Does anyone else relate to my story? I'm kinda at a loose end and feel my only option is to find like minded stories and comfort in a network of real experiences. Thanks!

"Just thought I’d like to share my experience with the drug and talk about the weight gain/weight loss journey I have encountered. 
I have been on Mirtazapine now for 14 months. I was perscribed it as I had depression/suicidal thoughts/insomnia/ anxiety and a stage of mania. Before taking it I was nestled at 11st with around 15% body fat.
Within 8 weeks of taking it I had gained 1st 10lb. I was sitting at 12st 10 for months. I felt horrible with this excess weight so I decided to take up a healthier lifestyle and up my excersize to shift it. After carefully calculating my macro’s and constructing a professional nutriton plan (friend is a PT and trained in nutrition) that put me in a healthy caloric defecit I was all set to go. After 16 weeks I managed to get myself back down to 11 stone. It was such a hard slog.  Some weeks I was losing 2lb and other weeks 1lb then some weeks nothing! I trained every day but Sundays. Even when I was in a caloric defecit, some weeks I’d lose no weight. I always weighed myself first thing on a morning. Same time every day on an empty stomach.
Anyhow I decided to quit the plan and go back to my regular eating as the weight was off. Bearing in mind it was just typical eating. Light breakfast and lunch and a hearty tea. I did make sure I still tracked calories and kept them at maintainence levels. I have done this as part of my normal routine for years. Never once went over. Anyhow in 3 weeks I managed to gain 8lbs!
I went straight back onto the caloric defecit diet and in 5 weeks I managed to lose 7 of the 8lb’s.
Again as soon as I got back to (slightly under) maintainence calories I seemed to gain weight. 
I have come to the conclusion now that it isn't impossible to lose weight on mirtazapine but it is a constant battle to keep it off. 
If you are aiming to do it you need to ensure it becomes a lifestyle, I honestly dont think it is possible to keep the weight gain at bay unless you are living in a defecit. Im not a scientist so unaware what effect the chemical can actually do to stop you losing weight but in my case I’ve found it definitley does unless you excersize regularly, drink lots of water and put yourself in a caloric defecit. 
Just wanted to share my experience incase anyone else has noticed anything similar. Hoping to start coming off the drug after christmas. I am certainly not looking forward to the withdrawal/taper that it seems to come with, however I think if you have a goal (like losing weight) whilst tapering I’m hoping it’ll make the withdrawal a lot easier. 
My advice to anyone who has been perscribed this drug... please research and weigh up every option you have before considering it to be an easy fix to your problems. 
Regards.

"When dealing with benzo withdrawal 8 months back, it was such hell that I tried a few diff meds to help me sleep. Allergy pills, even some antidepressants are used in low doses for insomnia. One of the only ones I found I could tolerate was Mirtazapine. It worked really well and I didn’t notice any side effects. So I took it off / on, for a couple months -- always only 7.5 mg., half of a 15 mg solubale pill. Well that off / on has actually been like 8 months now, but I never noticed a problem not sleeping when I didn’t have it. I only took it when I felt I needed extra sleep & would go long stretches not taking it. Definitely wasn’t taking it every day! Which is why I’m surprised here.
3 nights ago was when I first noticed difficulty getting to sleep without it. Anxiety, Heart racing, body buzz / nervous system agitated feeling. But I eventually did get to sleep. So 2 nights ago I decided to take it again and sleep well since the night before wasn’t good. Worked fine. Now last night is where all hell broke loose. Decided I’m not gonna take it again, and the anxiety and body buzz came again. But this time it was the most intense I’ve ever felt w any of these nasty drug side effects. I felt like I was going to have a seizure, for endless hours!!!! Nervous system writhing and racing like you’re possessed w electricity. AWFUL!!!
I tried my best to ride it out but it got scary and super uncomfortable. After doing a lot of reading on it, I decided the people who tapered off slowly had a much better time and that I couldn’t just quit cold turkey. So I took the devil pill again. But! This time? Didn’t cut it. Still hell. Didn’t fix it. I ended up getting a total of 2 hours sleep from 5am - 7am, before getting woken up into a pure panic again!! I can’t calm down. I can’t sit down. I can’t do anything but pace. Constantly. Whenever I sit or lie down I get the massive body buzz / nervous system freaking out thing. It’s the most uncomfortable feeling I’ve ever felt!!!!!!! Its the most intense in the morning.
Why didnt the 7.5 mg stop the madness? Did i take it too late? (3:30am) Do i need to go up in dose now before going down? How many days will this feeling last? how can i get off these evil pills???
PLEASE HELP!! thank you!

"so my psychiatrist told me to cut my dose in half, and then half again the next week, and keep going until my meds are gone. I took his advice and I think I went WAY to fast. I’ve felt sick all day today, had really bad mood swings, nauseous, brain fog, fast heart rate, chest pains, body pains, sweats, chills. Everything. Dizziness, EVERYTHING. I told my mom I needed to slow down but she said if I don’t drop tonight then I’ll never stsrt my new meds, so I took half of the dose I’ve been taking this week. I woke up in the middle of a panic attack last night and thought I was dying. Anyway, does anyone have any advice? How to deal with the withdrawl symptoms, anything? I’m only 15 and were on the meds for about 3 months

"Hello,
Been on Sertraline 200mg for over a decade but has pooped out twice in the last year and currently have really bad anxiety all day and insomnia. Dr has prescribed 15mg Mirtzapine as an augmentation strategy as they don't want me to go higher than 200mg Sertraline.
Apparently, Sert and Mirtz have a good track record. I've only been on the Mirtz for 1 week and there is constant battle between feel good (seretonin) rushes and hideous (anxiety). My Insomnia has lessended but still getting broken sleep. I feel like upping to 30mg Mirtz might crack it but it's only been 1 week on both. Anyone else augmenting these two with any advice? I'm struggling on at work through the day but it's killing me inside and exhausting.
Thanks all and good luck / best of health to all

"Hi all. I am just letting those of you know how Im doing off Mirtrazapine. Its been over 2 months and everything is just about back to normal. Its taken 3 to 4 months to come off but i feel like me again. Those who are tapering at the moment , please stick with the effects of withdrawl as they do subside. Main withdrawl is the anxiety and sleep issues. Remember anxiety is just a feeling, sensation we are making ourselves cause. Its nothing to fear. Just go with it. Let the feelings come in, feel it and then let it go. Try some mindfulness which you can read up on online and get out and about to do things to ease your mind off the anxiety symptoms.
If medication is needed for anxiety Propanalol is a good medication if symptoms get too much to deal with. These are not addictive and most doctors will prescribe them for anxiety. Pregabalin is also good for anxiety. This was my life saver. In the UK this is used for anxiety with very good results as it works quickly. Please look it up on the web.
Sleep issues is the next big thing i think most people who come off this drug get affected with. First of all having no sleep wont kill you. The average person only sleeps 4 to 5 hours a night ( I looked this up online) . Keep that thought in mind when your are lying there thinking Ive only had 2 to 3 hours sleep, HELP! Get into going to bed the same time every night and not going on mobiles or computers a good hour before bed. Otherwise your mind will be too awake. Only go to bed when you feel tired. Stay up as late as you can. This may mean going to bed say, midnight and having to be up for work at 6 in the morning. The first few times you may not sleep too good but after 3 to four nights of this your body will adjust as it will be so tired and craving sleep. If medication is a must try Valarian herbal tablets these are good . Antihistamines also work but only use when sleep is a must as they can be additive. The main thing is not to panic about it as sleep will come.
I hope this brief explanation of how Ive coped helps you all out there. One final thought is dont be in a rush to stop this medication. If its working and making you function and have a life take it. Thousands of people do and can be on it a long time. Having a happy life is better than the alternative. I took it as i was in a bad place due to both parents passing away. Over time i started to feel better with this medication and my mind was calmer and i could think straight. Only then i thought i would taper off it to see how things went and all in all at has not been at all bad. Its no good comparing how others feel as all of us are different and our bodies react different too. Ignore the scare stories about this medication as there are more good reviews than bad about mirtrazapine.

id also like to note i have anorexia and enxiety surrounding emetaphobia.
im guessing the doctors put me on the mirt to help me gain weight.
i started on 15mg and it was great, for about a month. i then upped to 30mg again great for about a month before i knew it i was on 45mg my anxiety is worse than ever, iv lost a further 2 stone in the two years iv been on this drug and im desperate to get off it.
iv managed to get down to 37.5mg from 45 with no issues and then anxiety talked me out of dropping further. i found the courage to drop again after 5 months to 33.75mg on sunday night and its been hell.
i cant eat, i cant sleep and i feel like i want to rip my entire skin off my body.
i need help!

"Alright,
So I'm about 12 weeks off I think.. After tapering off 7.5 -> 1.x something for 3 or so months.
Had bouts of major fatigue weeks 4-10 or something which gradually got better.
After that I became a little bit anxious and tense these last couple of weeks, not I've had constant dizziness for a week. Not a spinning dizziness, just problems with balance, like sometimes when you stand up too fast after sitting, although in my case it's more or less constant.
What the f***? Is this still withdrawal or is there something else going on?
I had a cold with runny and stuffy nose the week prior, but I visited a ENT doctor and she said there was no problems with those areas. I don't know what to think.
I'm contemplating popping a mirtazapine pill tonight. What do you think?

"I'd like to preface this by saying I am emetophobic, so any sort of withdrawal will be amplified for me.
I have been on Mirt for a year this month, starting at 7.5 and eventually increasing to 22.5. I have gained 32 pounds in a year and that's too much. 
The medication was great in the first few months - I was housebound when I first started taking it. I also wasn't eating or sleeping. But then I packed on the weight and my phobia began to get severe all over again. Now I feel like it's time to retire the mirt. It's the first and ONLY medication that has worked for me for anxiety. I am extremely sensitive to anything I take, and I have tried a slough of different meds. But the steady decline in feeling okay has got me wanting to stop taking it.
I have dealt with anxiety for 20 years, but in 2016 everything changed. Like the flip of a switch. I was all of the sudden having multiple, severe panic attacks every single day. I was a mess. I was at my breaking point when I started mirt, so things slowly got better from there.
I'm not having panic attacks as often as I was but I am starting to fear leaving the house because of my phobia and that's a bad sign.
But all these withdrawal horror stories? I am truly convinced I'll be stuck on this med forever. I have a toddler and a photography business. I cannot be stuck inside fearing everything because of withdrawals for months on end. So am I doomed to take this forever?
Despite me laying out all the evidence that a quick wean off mirt is a bad idea to my prescriber, he's still convinced his plan of weaning in 13 days will be fine. I won't be following that plan. I feel so screwed. 
Also, I have done a complete overhaul of my diet, I started last week. Cut out processed foods, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and am really making an effort to eat cleaner in hopes that it'll help my mental health.

I have tried to quit multiple times due to the weight gain and haven't been able to cope with the insomnia. I can go days without sleep but get severely paranoid and delusional so it's out of the question.
I have tried many sleep aids and natural treatments. I have found one that works. 
Phenergan (Promethazine)
Now I know it may not work for everyone, but for it to me sleep after using something strong like mirtazapine for over a year, it's good.
I took mirtazapine for depression but depression never really lifted, I had a good nights sleep and that was all.
I take 75mg of Phenergan about an hour before bedtime and it allows me to sleep through the night. I highly recommend it for any of you struggling with the insomnia side effect of mirtazapine withdrawal

"Hi,
I’m about to start mirtazepine for GAD/ depression/OCD. I’ve tried several ssris, cbt, meditation, hypnosis and therapy. I’m now on pregabolin which has helped a bit but I’m still not well. I now can’t try any other ssris because I’m on pregablin (was not told this when I started) so gp given me the option of Mirtazapine.
I’m a bit unsure on how this works because it looks like it helps a lot with sleep which in turn helps with anxiety but I don’t really have an issue with sleep anymore since starting pregabolin. So will it do anything else for me? I’m feeling a bit like I’ve lost all hope of finding something that helps.

"Hi everyone,
My PD prescribed me 37.5mg mirtazapine, towards the end of July this year, which I was on for a few weeks. I found it totally intolerable though, and decided to taper down myself.
I probably tapered too fast, and cut 7.5mg per week, until I was on my current dose of 15mg.
I've been on 15mg for one month now. I've felt the withdrawal effects strongly, and they still don't seem to be going away.
I had extreme anxiety last week. Last week, I drunk alcohol a few times, and I had pretty severe brain fog afterwards, which is still continuing.
I've decided to completely avoid alcohol for a while, but I don't know whether to remain at my dose of 15mg or to continue to taper down. Part of me wants to taper until I'm completely off this medication, but I'm worried the withdrawal symptoms will be bad again.
Any advice?
Thanks

"Hi all
I’m looking for some advice and reassurance. I was put on mirtazapine 30mg 18 months ago for post natal depression. I was hospitalized with my baby in a mental health facility. I took the 30mg for 2 nights and found it gave me vivid dreams so the psychiatrist dropped my dose to 15mg which I found incredibly sedating (in a good way at night) and have been taking that for about 15 months. I have very slowly been reducing my dose by purchasing 15mg tablets and 1/4 them, removing a 1/4 at a time month by month. I had barely noticed the lesser dose - it worked fantastically well. It’s interesting to note that when I ran my plan via my psychiatrist he told me to just stop taking it and thought I was over thinking it! For the last 6 weeks I’ve been on 3.75mg and still found this sedating at night. Two weeks ago today was my sons 2nd birthday and I decided enough is enough - I want to give him a sibling one day and I want to get off this drug so I stopped it. The first week I was absolutely fine, sleeping through the night perhaps not quite as deep but well rested but this last week has been tough to say the least. The first 5 nights I would wake at 2 am and often not go back to sleep and the last two nights have been incredibly restless (maybe 3 hours all up). Has anyone experienced this and how long do you think it might last on average? I’m afraid I’ll never sleep normally again. I used to sleep 9/10 hours a night like a dream before baby and medication! I am also a registered nurse and fully admit that the medical girls are poorly informed in this area. It’s dangerous territory. My thoughts and sympathy go out to anyone else struggling - I’m with you!

"Hi,
I have taken 15mg for just over 2 weeks. This was for anxiety (was having raised heart rate at night) & was to help me sleep. After starting tablets I suffered from increased anxiety where i could not sit still , an increased heart rate & ringing in my ears.dry mouth. I slept well for first night but not so well the second night & then woke during the nights after . Had to ring 111 & Dr's a number of times. I was told it was my anxiety & to keep taking tablets..But was given diazapan & sleeping tablets to help. I took 30mg of Mirt on duty Dr's advice for 2 nights but had increased heart rate & was then advised to take 15mg for 3 nights until saw GP. I have slept when taking 15mg but have woken few times during night.
& i felt slightly drowsy in day time. I could also feel
increased heart rate . I was calmer & less restless GP believed it was my anxiety not tablets causing bad effects but as I had issues with tablets she has told me to stop taking them & to use diazapam to sleep if need be. GP will ring me next week to see how i am doing but feels i need meds. She told me that OAP's are prescribed Mirt as they are safe & have less side effects. She said it was my decision & i could just stop taking them. I stopped Mirt last night. My heart rate has increased & i could not sleep. The 2mg of diazapam i had to take at 1am only worked for a few hours. I now have permanent
palpatations ..worse lying down.. stopping me sleep. I had read bad reports re Mirt which worried me & wanted to stop before things potentially got worse..but can't bear thought of having palpatations for much longer or starting new tablets. Sorry have gone on but don""t know if GP is right & it is my anxiety not tablets & whether to persevere with Mirt .. take 1 tonight to see if i sleep..or not .. i feel much worse after stopping for 1 night.. but have read that missing i night when taking tablets should not matter..Any advice appreciated as i am at wirs end.. ...Many thanks

"Hi posted here a few weeks ago about stopping 15mg Mirt after taking it for three weeks and kinda looking for some updated reassurance. So the psychiatrist said that at such a low dose I could just stop taking it and I'd be fine but after doing some research I decided to taper. I went down to 7.5mg for 10 days then 3.75mg (difficult because had to cut 15mg tablets into quarters!) for 8 days and my last dose was Thursday night. I'm only three days in and feeling really nauseous pretty much all the time - I have a big phobia of nausea/vomiting so this is a very scary time for me. I've read lots of reports that this feeling can worsen and last for weeks or months.
Do you think I should be okay soon seeing as I was only taking Mirt for just over a month? I can't deal with feeling ill at all the anxiety of it is too much and if it persists it will make me suicidal. I know that sounds dramatic but that's the extent of my phobia. I've tried discussing this with the psych but she just brushed me off and said to buy some pepto bismol and deal with it.
I have another appointment with her in a couple weeks but she expects me to be off the Mirt and on 20mg of Citalopram by then and the stress of it all is just making me worse.
Any kind words would be so appreciated.

"Hi,
I am a 60 year old male. For the last few years I have suffered from constant daytime tiredness and occasional periods of nausea .The nausea I had been told was probably due to my hernia of the esophagus and I had been taking 15mg lansoprazole daily for many years to combat  acid reflux.
This year the nausea just didn't go away and the tiredness was getting worse. Over the last few months apart from many blood tests, all OK, I have had a gastroscopy, a CT scan and an ultrasound.
These all came back normal. I was surprised when the gastroscopy even said my esophagus was normal. So I have stopped taking lansoprazole.
This week  I saw yet another locum GP at my practice to discuss things. He asked me if I got stressed. Well yes I do, mainly about lack of job security and poverty ! This year has also been bad due to a new neighbour with a ""home alone"" dog barking for hours, ruining my time in my own house/garden and I was getting into a right state over it.
  I told him that I self prescribed modafinil to cope with the tiredness. I am talking about getting up at 7am and by 10 am I  often just have to go back to bed. I then sleep for an hour or so, but feel so tired all day that I can't do anything when I get up again. So after much research I have been taking usually 100mg modafinil about 4 or 5 days a week.
  This doctor has prescribed mirtazapine, saying it will help me sleep better and make me feel less stress. I have just read lots of horror stories on this forum about it and at the moment feel there is no way I will take it. I am already about a stone and a half overweight and don't have the strongest will power anyway, but had resolved to lose weight, but from what I have just read, feel like I will just gain weight. That alone wouldn't necessarily stop me from taking it, but I have just read lots of stories about it increasing tiredness and other unpleasant side effects. Does anyone have any really positive things to say about this drug ?
I would welcome any comments from anyone with a similar experience to mine who has taken it.  Mark.

"Hi
CBT was hailed as the new way to empty the psychiatric hospitals and clinics, cut down the use of anxiolytics and help people improve their quality of of life. It has become so pervasive that GPs often ask patients to self refer. Some of these patients are initially assessed over the phone and offered CBT once a week - by telephone.
How would you feel about this? Have you experience of it?
Thanks for you time.

For more context:
These are what led up to being submitted to the ward.
-having and acting out irrational beliefs that she 's overdosing and running out of breath
-being indecisive in daily tasks and moving around
-speaking nonsense and acting frail
Personally, I think the doctor didn't do a good job diagnosing her and just gave her any meds

"For about a year now i've been getting alot of smymtpoms which include: 
Masive sensory overload. Everything sounds loud and my eyes are extremely dry and feel like im staring into something bright. 
Muscle weakness
Dehydration
Poor circulation 
general swelling 
reflux 
depression 
insomnia
tight sinuses 
constant ringing in my ears. 
constipation
Difficulty peeing
These symptoms have been slowly growing for about a year and have been getting worse and worse. I wouldn't have a clue why, im extremely healthy, get sleep, dont smoke or drink. The only thing that makes the symptoms worse is masturbation. Once i do it they get worse and constantly remain in the same state and either get worse once i masturbate again or just stay the same. i've tried not masturbating for about 6 weeks but the symptoms have remained the same. 
These symptoms have been pulling my back in school and socially. my appointments for neurology have been constantly moved back and i need to get this sorted out. Just knowing whats wrong with me would be a start because i dont even know what i could do to improve?
Anything is helpful. Thanks

"Hi guys my doctor has given me a prescription for Mirtazapine 15mg at night for my chronic insomnia. I usually have more trouble staying asleep than getting asleep. Lately I wake up about 3x a night, so roughly every couple of hours. Will this drug stop this happening? And is it true that it's more sedative at lowered dose in that if I had just a crumb of it I would be very sleepy? Thank you.

"Hi, just an update, i have been weaning off mirt since june. I started initially on 15mg last april then reached 7.5mg last june. It was prescribed for me by my gp because she thought i was having anxiety thats why i wasnt able to sleep. Fast forward, i reduced from 7.5 to 6.5 last june, and stated for 3 wks. Then i reduced again to 5mg and stayed for 4 wks. I noticed that i would feel the symptoms after about 5 days and then will be on and then come again on the 2-3rd wk. My symptoms would be the feeling of being unwell like muscle and joint aches, like almost having a flu coming, severe tiredness. So far thats all. Then i reduced again after 4 wks and now i am on 4.5mg. Still the same, symptoms come after 5 days then again at 2-3 wks. And i am so sleepy even during the day. So far sleep has not been affected. Now my question is, how long will this feeling of muscle and joint pains as well as feeling so sleepy be gone? I am really hoping i can get off this med successfully.

"Hi,
I've been taking 15mg of mirtazapine for three weeks after being talked into taking it (I wasn't happy to do so but was told by the doc I wouldn't be offered any other help unless I took them) I'm really not happy about taking them and the side effects are too much for me - I'm sleeping at least 11hrs a day (even though I struggle to get to sleep and when I finally do I'm having bad dreams and half waking every few hours) and spending the rest of the time exhausted so can't get anything done. I've also had a constant headache, aching muscles and joints, weight gain and I'm pretty much just feeling worse. I know it's only been been three weeks and I'll be told to give them a chance but I want off of this drug before I'm miserably stuck on it so please don't advise me to take it for longer or up my dose because I'm adamant I'm stopping it.
So basically what I am after is some advice about how to stop taking it please. Will I need to do a slow taper or will that make things worse? I have a massive phobia of vomiting (including feeling nauseous) so this is a big big worry for me and if there's a way I can avoid this as a withdrawal effect I'd love to know.
Sorry if I'm not making much sense - my head is so fuzzy! Any help or reassurance would be really appreciated. Thanks (:

"I've been on Mirtazapine for a few years now. Started at 15, went up to 30 and then onto 45, some 18 months approx, where I stayed until March of this year. I dropped down to 30 and have been there for the last six months. And it was a sudden drop no tapering. As a result, I experienced a few nights of insomnia and some recurrent anxiety a few weeks in. Nothing to major but enough to make me very wary of jumping that big a drop in the future.
I want to change over to Sertraline. And my GP has indicated that this is possible. However, I wanted to reach out to see if anyone else had done this and to learn of any caveats.
The reason for wanting to change is to do with the constant hunger and threat of weight gain that has been hanging over me since I started the Mirts and the daytime grogginess.
Anyone?

"I was using mirtazapine for insomnia for more than a year.
During this time I felt that I had weak legs and trouble to do any kind of exercise(e.g. shortness of breath and palpitations).
Now I have been off for about 14-15 weeks. 
I have had a huge list of a different kind of withdrawal symptoms and still have, but the overall situation is much better today than 8 weeks ago.
Something which worries about me is that I still have very difficult to do any kind of exercises. Okay, now the situation is better because in first three weeks I barely could walk. Legs were so shaky.
About month ago I started to do some abs, pull ups, push ups and squats (5/each/ only 1 set). Now I'm doing 20/each/ 1 set.
Do any of you have similar kind of experiences? Every time when I'm doing this, I feel shortness of breath, getting palpitations and afterward I need to lay down for an hour or even more to recover from this!

"I have just been told by my psychiatrists team they are changing my meds, and I’ll need to be off of Mirtazapine for four days before I start the new lots. I’m on my 3rd day without Mirtazapine and up until now I’ve not felt too bad, just bumbled I’m with things. But this afternoon I started getting pains where I’d previously bruised (but thought I’d recovered) and then later this evening It’s spread to nearly every other joint and my back. It’s quite intense pain, but I cannot find anyone else who has had withdrawals like this so I’m wondering if it is withdrawals or something else? Zapain pain relief has eleviated the pain slightly but can still feel it. It feels like when you get chilled to the bone pain but 10x worse?

"Over the past couple years, I have very slowly lowered my Remeron dose from 60mg to 3.75 with a 3.75mg-at-a-time drop each decrease, with anywhere between a few days and several months for each dose decrease. It would usually take 10-14 days to normalize after each decrease and the weird withdrawal symptoms (nausea, anxiety, brain fog, dizziness, malaise) would go away entirely. 
Usually I just split pills, sometimes alternate doses the first few days, and it's not too bad. 
However, going from 7.5 to 3.75 has been particularly difficult. It has been nearly 4 weeks and I still feel the aforementioned symptoms, including some ""heavy, raw brain"" sensation. The only regrettable part about this process is that I tend to utilize klonopin to help with withdrawal anxiety, and when on less remeron, I tend to have more cravings, so it's sort of an odd cycle. I would, of course, like to quit klonopin entirely as well.
So, to go from 3.75 to 0... Right now, I have 7.5mg tablets and cut them in two to make 3.75. I know some people make an aqueous solution by dissolving pills. I don't want to do that. Does anyone have advice on how to slowly taper off? I have a couple long jobs that involve travel over the next 2 months, but I don't want to wait until after to do this. Should I try taking 3.75 6 days a week for a couple weeks, then 5 days a week for a week, 4 days a week, then begin to alternate, then go every 3 days, then every 4 days, something like that? 
I feel like if I extend my taper too long, I'll be more inclined to THINK I'm withdrawing and take a klonopin or whatever. So I need a good balance.
I would love any advice - thank you so much in advance!

"An Internal Medicine specialist placed me on 60 mg's of Mirtazapine @ bedtime as a sleep aid as I have been experiecing muscle cramps and nerve pain that came on suddenly about fourteen months ago. The specialist's diagnosis; ""Fibromyalgia."" Since then I have had an MRI that showed I have spinal stenosis, disc bulging and bone spurs located primarily along my cervical and lumbar spine. Mirtazapine has helped me sleep quite well at night. Therefore, I have continued to keep taking this medication. After dosing before bedtime, my spasms and nerve pain calm down. During waking hours my spasms and nerve pain get much worse as the day progresses. A lot of rigidity as well that was not there before taking what appears to be a large daily dose of this medication. Could the elevated muscle spasms, nerve pain and rigidity during waking hours be a side effect of only taking the Mirtazapine at bedtime and none during the day? Kind of a hangover effect?

"Hi,
Recently I had a long psychiatriatic eval with a psychiatrist and he said he thought I had General Anxiety Disorder. I was prescribed between 30 - 45 mg of Mirtazapine, and he left it up to me to find a dosage between that that suited me best.
For about a week after, I felt nothing except for a few side effects on a dose of 37.5mg. I lowered the dose to 30mg and about a week later, felt fantastic for about 6 days. After that, I started to feel bad, so I upped the dosage to 37.5mg, but I still feel pretty dreadful. I've now had about a week for feeling bad after my 6 days of feeling great.
Unfortunately, this pattern of feeling fantastic for a week and then in the next week feeling worse than ever keeps repeating itself. Over the past few months, I've tested Wellbutrin and Venlafaxine, and the story is always the same. I feel great for about 1 week and then after that feel worse than ever. Apparently my switches in moods has been noticed by people I work with (one week, full of life, confident and funny; the next week feel so bad that I curl up into a shell of myself)
Does anyone know what the hell is going on here? I'm considering just giving up on medication altogether as it only seems to make me feel worse.
Thanks

"Hi, I know many people have asked things like this before. I've just started mirtazapine - I actually started on it 3 months ago but gave up after just 2 days due to the side-effects. This time around I'm on day 4 but the side-effects are still really bothering me and I would welcome any advice about when I can expect them to lift - or when, if they still haven't lifted, it would be time to give up. I feel groggy, difficulty concentrating, light-headed, a bit dizzy, and also increasingly agitated. It was prescribed me due to both depression and difficulty sleeping. It has helped with sleep, I think, but since it still is making me feel nearly as awful as a lack of sleep I'm struggling with whether it's worth it. My GP said to give it at least 3 weeks. I'm on 15 mg.

"Hi there, 
I have been on mirtazapine for 6 months, mostly at 15 mg, only on 30 mg for one month and it was a couple months back. Last week I decided to get off the meds as I felt they were no long benefitting me. My psych PA told me to come off cold turkey which I was concerned about so decided to alternate at 7.5 for the last week. I took my last dose last night and feel worse - nauseous, dizzy, body aches, chest pain, out of it in general. 
I’ve decided it isn’t worth keeping in my system. Just wanted to get advice on if these symptoms are normal. How long will this last? Anything I can do to help speed up the recovery process?

"Hi there. I was on Mirtazapine for about 8 months to help with anxiety. I was on 30 mg for around 5 months and 15 mg for the rest .Duringg that time I gained around 15 kg (33 lbs). My doctor and I decided it would be a good idea to come off them due to the weight gain as I was feeling much better. I tapered for around 2 months then came off the last few mg very rapidly.
I have been off them for 6 weeks and have yet to lose any of the weight I gained. I am active, running or playing sport most days and am eating much less now.
I feel fantastic as far as my anxiety and depression are concerned (the best I have felt in years), but not being able to lose any weight yet is very disheartening. I was always pretty trim and now I can't even look at my naked body in the mirror.
Has anyone had trouble losing the weight after coming off?
How long will it take before the weight should come off?
Any help would be great. I am at a loss

"Oh no. Today, I write as a woman who has battled through several years of mental illnesses, including inexplicable anorexia (I love cooking, spending 6 days a week, spending most my time reading recipes and grocery shopping), among several underlying ailments that have been so positively responsive to Remeron (Mitz). I've been on it 6 months. Started at 7.5 mg, got nothing, then 15 mg and effects were OK, at 30 mg started gaining weight, fast forward ended up on 45 mg about a month ago and I gained 20 pounds and was healthier than I'd ever been - save for feeling like I have had a serious flu for months now.
I am a better woman today, because of Mitz; so I am now both at a loss, and also, incredibly relieved to find that my chronic back pain, excruciating muscle pain, tension headaches, morning stiffness, and peripheral myopathy are all severely exacerbated symptoms of Mitz. I cannot wiggle toes in left foot: studies show no abnormalities on X-Ray, EMG, NCV, MRI, and blood checks out good on every test from K to auto-immune. I wake up and go to bed feeling like I've gotten beaten with a bat. Underlying Fibromyalgia (Fibro) noted - but looking to wean down, get off Mitz, and see that symptoms find relief. All this muscle pain from Mitz has put me on one chronic, several month long Fibro flare-up.
I can't trust doctors anymore. I didn't celebrate my birthday because GP and I thought I had a stress fracture in my foot (common side note of chronic anorexia) and wore a boot for 3 weeks. Doctors profile me ""seeking opioids"" when I have not had 1 prescription strength medication offered me in my life, because tests are normal. EMG & NCV were excruciating. I just need some real guidance here. 
I wake up in pain, go to sleep in pain, and no medical treatments help. (Ibuprofen does nothing, gabapentine, nothing; advil, nothing; cyclobenzaprene, nothing; anti-inflammatory glute shots, nothing; three shots of rum, super effective). Position at work stressed due to constant visits to ortho, chiro, ER, Urgent Care, Spine Pain Specialists, psychiatrists, neurologists...
It's going to be OK though! I have two sweet puppies and a wonderful SO.

"Hi. I've taken mirtrazapine for over 7 months. For anxiety, grief, depression. In May I felt well and started a slow withdrawal under doctors suoervision. First 4 weeks took 3/4 of a 15 mg pill. Cut the pill into 4 segments and took 3. Did this for 4 weeks. Then cut down to half a pill or two segments. Continued this for 5 weeks. Now on last drop of 1/4 tablet or one segment. Will continue this for 4 weeks. It has not been to bad. Have had morning anxiety and nausea. My doctor has given me tablets for the nausea which help. Sleep as been poor but I do manage to drop off eventually and try not to make a issue of it. Our bodies do sleep when we need it. What has helped also is reading books on anxiety and depression and why we feel like we do . Try amazoby which has many good books on this. The books put things into perspective of why our minds and bodies feel like they do when having anxiety and depressive thoughts. One thing that made me see sense is anxiety is caused by ourselves. Ourselves keep it going. So I do mindful relaxation ( info available on internet) and this helps. Also depressive thoughts, again ourselves create these. I now get out more and focus on good points of my day. There's no quick fix but things do get better. I will post back in the next week to let you know how I'm doing. One thought, if you think miserable thoughts you will be miserable. Think of a friend spending the day with a miserable you? Wound you want to??

"Hello everybody! I'm a 21 year old male, was always in good health, active, energetic. I'm new to the forum and I'm doing my best to post this under the appropriate terms. My story goes like this: On May 24th 2018 I was prescribed Mirtazapine by a psychiatrist because I had an acute insomnia problem (I wouldn't even call it Insomnia because it was a minor problem just sleeplessness) lasting for 3 weeks prior to the day I took my first pill. I never had depression or anxiety or any other problem it was just for insomnia. The psychiatrist was quick to prescribe me Mirtazapine after only a couple of questions, she didn't even bother with psychotherapy and similar methods. She told me to take half a dose (7.5mg) for two days and then up the dose to 15mg for four weeks and then visit her for a check-up. My sleeping problem was resolved instantly the first night I took the pill so after 4 weeks I visited her and she said now we'll start tapering you off by taking half the dose (7.5mg) for two weeks, and then taking it every other day for 5 days and then nothing. So I followed her orders since day 1 and did exactly what she told me. But, immediately after I stopped withing the first two days I started experiencing flu like symptoms, low energy, bad mood, irritability, higher levels of cortisol and anxiety, general feeling of being very sick and uneasiness. Symptoms kept adding up like: constant headaches (which I never had in my whole entire life, I never knew what a headache felt like), electric shocks through my body mainly in the fingers and toes but not limited to only them, and generally feeling like having the worst flu of my life. So I called the same psychiatrist and she told me we have reduced too fast, so we'll start the same therapy again take 7.5mg for two days then 15mg for two weeks. Within the first few days I found relief from most of my symptoms and followed her orders but after about two weeks while still on 15mg the symptoms returned. I went online and searched for people with the same problems maybe even worse. I read a lot of horror stories of people coming off this drug but I read a lot of positive tapering experiences too. And now with all the info I could gather (CITA Protocol, 10% tapering method by SA, the importance of a slow taper) I started crushing the pills and doing a liquid version like Evergreen had done and taper by small percentages while listening to my body and I started immediately after three weeks of taking 15mg, so the next day after that,using the liquid I cut to 14ml (I made the liquid so 1ml equals 1mg of Mirt) and the next day I felt horrible until the evening when most of my symptoms subsided so I continued on that dose for three days, then cut to 13ml and it's been 9 days since that cut and the last 4 days I'm having the same withdrawal symptoms. I wanted to ask you guys since I have never really felt the same as before taking this medication although way better than when I stopped like that listening to doc's orders, how should I proceed from now? Did the reduction that she did damage my brain permanently because the symptoms are still here and they come and go. Also that reinstatement 7.5 for two days than 15mg for three weeks, is that damaging? Please people tell me what should I do and how to proceed? I've been thinking of doing it the same as Evergreen and maybe I'll get lucky and be off this med without any serious side effects or withdrawals. My family and my precious girlfriend are the only people close to me that support me all the time especially the love of my live because she was the only person who believed me when I told her that these symptoms are from the medication and not from ME. Because the psychiatrist started diagnosing me with anxiety and all of these other things that I never had then my parents trusted her but now they know that I'm right and it's the meds after reading almost everything on this forum. And finally thank you to everyone on this forum for opening my eyes and telling me about the symptoms and withdrawals. Please guys help me get through this unharmed as I'm still feeling the symptoms and don't know how to proceed.

"So some back story is I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years and was stable at one point but for the past two years it's been extremely terrible.
I was on mirtazapine 15mg, rexulti 1mg, and venlafaxine 37.5mg for a about 7 months. I was barely getting through even on all of those medications so my psychiatrist raised rexulti to 2 mg for about a month and I didn't like the way it made me feel. My psych then lowered rexulti back to 1mg and then took me off it completely. She switched me to wellbutrin 100mg which increased suicidal thoughts for me. I felt absolutely terrible. I was on it as well as the others for about two weeks. She took me off of wellbutrin and increased mirtazapine to 30 mg. The next day I took magnesium glycinate 100 mg hoping to get some relief from how bad I was feeling. So at this point I was on 30mg mirtazapine, 37.5mg venlafaxine and had just gotten off of wellbutrin a day or two prior to taking the magnesium glycinate. I'd also been taking fish oil on and off for months.
Shortly after taking magnesium glycinate, I noticed my breathing slowed a bit but wasn't too bad. The next day my chest was feeling tight like it was hard to take a deep breath and I had a weird pain in my throat with a lot of anxiety and some lightheadedness. This continued for a few days to a week. I got sick a couple days after with a cold or possibly my sinuses, (I'm not really sure what it was). It was hard to pin point what was causing what. I got off wellbutrin, then took mag glycinate, then started feeling all these different symptoms a day after then got sick a couple days after that. It was hard to tell if it was the mag glycinate or not especially since I didn't fully feel symptoms until the next day and I only took 1 dose of 100mg. The pains in my chest/throat eventually went away. I still feel lightheaded and have this weird cloudy feeling in my head, I'm very sensitive to noise, have headaches, and everything just feels like a dream. It's really scary. About a week after seeing some improvement in ny symptoms, my psychiatrist wanted me to add folate to my combo of mirt 30mg and venlafaxine 37.5mg, which I did. The cloudiness in my head increased so a week after I stopped the folate. That was a week ago. Since I took the mag glycinate and later the folate, I've been feeling lightheaded, extreme brain fog (which I had to a lesser extent before), bad memory (which was already failing before), headaches, noises seem so loud, bad anxiety, some restlessness, and it seems like I'm in a dream.

"Hi all first post here.
Finally had enough with feeling down and have constantly had sucidial thoughts in my head almost everyday,so I went to see the Dr's who put me on sertraline 50mg and I made an appointment with a wellness councillor.
The wellness councillor said I have aniexty and depression and could do with talking to somebody and that the doc should up my meds to 100mg to open up more?.
That was 7 weeks ago I don't feel like the sertraline has done anything I'm still having lots of negative thoughts,lying awake at night crying etc,so much so I rang the wellness people up again to find out when my appointment would be only to be told it could be 6-8 months!
I've since been bk doctors who's switched me to Mirtazapine 15mg and lowered the sertraline to 50mg.
The Mirtazapine first time I took it from completely knocked me out! I've struggled the last few days to the point I feel like a zombie and detached even more,also strange dreams and very sensitive to sounds especially when out dog suddenly barks.
Does the drowsiness wear off? It makes me want to do nothing! Also the doc recommended a site called mood gym but it's £40 has anyone used it?
Sorry about the long post

"Hi, has anyone else had these visual issues start when taking mirtazapine? A few days after starting on 15mg I started noticing lots of moving dots in my vision when looking at the sky or bright white walls etc (visual snow), plus a lot more floaters than normal. I put it down to my anxiety and tried to ignore it.  This went on for 10 weeks until I contacted my doctors who said it must be my anxiety, had eye tests (all ok), and increased my dose to 30mg.  A week after going up, I started noticing very pronounced after images (look at google logo for a split second then look at plain white part of the screen and can see a negative version of the logo for a couple of seconds).  I've also noticed flickering florescent lighting that isn't actually flickering and when looking at striped patterns for a few seconds they start to vibrate.  I had NONE of this before starting mirtazapine.  I went back down to 15mg for a few days then stopped taking them, but have had terrible muscle twitching since so am back on them.  However, I'm really worried that the tablets could be doing long term damage to my vision so am wondering whether I should stay on them for a bit longer in the hope that when I stabilise the twitching goes away, or whether I should come off them again asap because of the vision issues.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I have found a few things on google linking mirtazapine with these types of visual disturbances but not much on forums with people talking about it? 
Anyone?... please?!

"Please someone help I really need advice!!, I cold turkeyed mirtazapine and didn't reinstate until 5.5 weeks later as the horrible anxiety didn't surface until then. I only had total nausea the first 4 weeks and lost a stone. I reinstated at 3.9mg for 5 days then 7.5mg for 8 days. I Then went back on my original dose but that was at 7 weeks after my cold turkey. I have been on 15mg for 15 days but not had much relief from this nightmare anxiety. How long does anyone think it takes for the Mirtazapine to help relieve the anxiety?
My doctor keeps saying several weeks but don't know if this is the case. Please help!!!

"Hi, I was on 15 mg Mirt for 10 weeks, then 30 for 2, then dropped back to 15 for 4 nights then nothing for 7 nights.  When I dropped down to 15 I started getting muscle tremors in my legs at night and they have progressively got worse to the point where where they are every 10 seconds or so on random parts of the body all day/night. I also experienced the nausea, shakiness, adrenaline rushes, sweats, muscle aches etc all after a couple of days coming off.  I can't go on like this and after reading all the horror stories about going cold turkey I cant believe my doctor told me to do it!  So now I'm wondering what dose I should start back up on in the hope that these tremors will ease before I do a slow taper?  I was only on it for 13 weeks so hoping that it shouldn't take too long to get off once I start tapering but dont know what to start back at?  Any advice much appreciated.
Thanks,

"Hello, I was hoping someone could give me some advice as i have just started mirtazapine. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression. Today is my 6th day and wondering if this is the right medication for me. Is it common to wake up verry sedated almost the feeling as tho one is ""buzzed""? It also makes me sleep about 10 hrs a night and its verry difficult to wake up the next morning. I also get tense headaches that seem to come more at night. Aside from the mention side effects no change has accured to mood,anxiety, or energy(depression). In fact I feel that this medication is making me less motivated. Any inputs from past experiences? I forgot to mention i am on 15 mg. Thank you.

"So last week I went to the Doctors and got my Mirtazapine upped from 15mg to 30mg, I had just been in the middle of a bad spell that had been triggered by my period (this always happens when I get my period). I had been feeling generally kind of low anyway so I thought upping would be a good idea well now I really regret it. Since I started the 30mg I have felt nauseous and have had a really bad stomach, i've also been unable to sleep. Before the tablets made me drowsy and that bothered me but now I miss it because it is torture being awake like this and constantly thinking. My intrusive thoughts are on and off but they're harder to distinguish from what I really think - like my brains tricking me into thinking "" this thought is what you want"" instead of being able to tell it was intrusive like I could on 15mg. I'm also EXTREMELY emotional like I keep freaking out and crying at every little thing. When I came home from work today after feeling extremely out of it and sick the whole day I cried and messaged my mum telling her that I don't think I can keep taking this dosage. She agreed that i should go back down and that has relaxed me a little and I feel better now than I have done since I started BUT I think this is only because my brain is reassured that I will be going back down to a familiar dosage. 15mg was not perfect but it was far better than how I am feeling on this, I have been majorly sensitive to everything my girlfriend does and I keep treating her unfairly because my emotions are everywhere and it's making me paranoid. 
The only issue I'm having now is that I don't want to go down to 15mg incase this is just my body trying to level out the increase, though I know my body is very sensitive to drugs in general so I really might not be suited to the 30mg. Basically I'm looking for advice on whether not I should try and tough it out or if I should just contact my doctor and say this isn't working. I know a lot of people don't handle 30mg well and I'm just thinking I may be one of them. 
One last thing: The reason I was put on Mirtazapine was because I was majorly underweight and could not sleep at all, now the 30mg has no effect on my eating and sleeping and I really wish it would like the 15mg did.

"hello, I am back. Update on how I am doing:
-I was admitted into a psychiatric hospital because my mental health got so out of control that even my own doctor couldn’t help me
-found out that I, in fact, do NOT have a brain tumor
-got prescribed new medicine 
so I’ve been on remeron for coming up 4 weeks now. My sleep and appetite have improved very much, and my mood has been a lot better. However, I still have certain symptoms. Does the mirtazipine take longer to work for anxiety? Or should it have already worked by now. My symptoms are: feeling like I’m in a dream. This is what bothers me the most. Before I got help, I was experiencing extreme dp/dr, but now it just seems like I’m in a dream. Sometimes I think that I’m really in a coma and I’m just waiting to wake up. Sounds absurd, I know, but I can’t help it! I get twitches, which I didn’t notice until I took a dose of buspar, which I stopped taking right away because it make me extremely lightheaded, and I though I was going to pass out, make me weak in one arm, and make me twitch really badly.  I still notice eye floaters and sometimes my vision does weird things but it doesn’t bother me as much. I guess my question is.. does remeron take longer to help with anxiety? Should I be worried? Does anyone relate/have similar stories?

I was on 7.5mg for 2 years, except a failed discontinuation which lasted 3 months a half a year ago.
Jumped off from 3.75 which I took every other day in the end.
Could this still be withdrawal or have the original symptoms come back to bite me?

I do have a phobia with meds and now I’m freaked out I have all these side effects but I took such a low dose I think I might be just having my anxiety kick in and making me worse. It said on the bottle there is a side effect of fear which I guess is like anxiety.  I just can’t imagine 1 dose could do this but I could use some reassurance!  And if it is wouldn’t the side effects wear off fast?  thanks for any replies!

"I have been taking Mirt for 3 weeks now.  Before this I was on Amitriptyline for a good few years but they stopped working. After that  I took Citalopram which I had bad side effects and gave me a loss of appetite.  I had another go at Amitriptyline for sleep and it stopped working again.  My GP started me on Sertraline 50mg.  I was fine for the first few days but after that I had a permanent stomach ache for nearly 3 weeks. I finished them  and then started Mirt 15mg,  but after 2 weeks I was getting headaches from the tiredness.  I spoke to my GP and she said to try 7.5mg for a few nights or try Venlafaxine if I didn't want to stay on Mirt.   Anyway I decided to stick with Mirt as I read some bad reviews for  the Venlafaxine and don't want to be messing about with different meds. I know everyone is different,  but I couldn't be hassled with the side effects,  feel I can't deal with them too well. The tiredness has worn off a bit and headaches aren't so bad now. But some days I feel like I can't be bothered with anyone or anything.  How long will it take for full effects of Mirt to work  or should they be fully working for me by now. Maybe I'm expecting miracles to happen too soon.

I have been on 15 mg for 1.5 years, then 7.5 for a few months, then 3.75 and finally 1.875 before stopping it alltogether.
I had very few WD symptoms due to my slow tapering.
Now, 1 month after my last 1.875 mg dose, I feel close to normal, but still have some gastrointestinal issues (cramps, sometimes diarrhea, bloating...) which started approximately 2 weeks after my last dose.
Anyone with a similar experience or a solution ?

"I've been on 15mg Mirtazipine for over 6 years (can't remember exactly).  I've tried coming off it before but usually got awful withdrawal effects at 7.5mg and gave up.  I decided I would taper really slowly this time and have been taking 12.5mg one night and 15mg another night for 2 weeks now.  I have felt a bit odd the whole time, with funny pressure on my head but 2 nights ago I started having issues with insomnia and feeling like my body is tingling and about to explode with energy.  I didn't get this before this early on?  Also, I should add that I have a chronic illness which sometimes gives me issues a bit similar to this so I'm unsure what is causing what.  So, my question is, could it be the Mirtazipine causing the issue after such a short time and with such gradual tapering?  Thanks, I hope someone can shed some light on this

"Hi, I was on 15mg of mirtazapine for 10 weeks, upped to 30mg for 2 weeks, started noticing some visual disturbances (seeing after images a lot, patterns vibrating, moving dots in the sky) so doctor said to go back down to 15mg for a week and then switch to 50mg of sertraline to see if the mirtazapine is the cause. Straight after going down to 15mg I started getting constant (every 10 seconds or so) muscle tremors through the night in random parts of the body which woke me and kept me awake. I told the doctor who didn't mention that it may be withdrawal and told to come off the mirtazapine after 4 nights and been on sertraline for 5 days. After reading, other peoples posts I read of the horrors of coming off these. My anxiety has spiked, having hot flashes, no appetite, nausea and headaches. Worst of all though I've had a full week of these muscle tremors which are really scaring me now and causing no sleep. Phoned 111 yesterday and the doctor said its withdrawal and will last about a week(!?) and prescribed 4 lorazepam to give me some sleep and told to go down to 25mg Sertraline. I'm wondering now though whether I should go back on the mirtazapine again instead maybe in a smaller dose and taper down?? I'm really worried about what is happening in my head/body and what damage may be being done :-(  has anyone else experienced such constant tremors coming off? Have been reading about people saying to reinstate, have I been off them too long to go back on and should I just stick it out from here?? I didn't want to go on antidepressants  in the first place but gave in to the pressure - really wish I'd never taken the things now  :-(

"Hi,
I've never posted on a forum before but wondered if anyone could give me any advise.
I was diagnosed with depression just before christmas, I had quite a traumatic year with a series of bad events occurring, I was also getting married which I think was the only thing keeping me going, looking back now I realise I was slipping into a depressive state for about 2 months before I finally broke. I fell into quite a catatonic state being unable to function at even a basic level, it was as if my brain had just shut down.
The doc started me on sertraline but this made my anxiety so bad that I couldn't even go into my back garden, unable to leave the house or speak to anyone for a month, he then gave me citralopram, this reduced my anxiety but gave me insomnia, so I spent another month sleeping (or rather not sleeping) on my sofa and only getting a few hours of sleep here and there.
So my doc decided to try mirtazapine, my depression has reduced dramatically but I've have gained a lot of weight, which at first I thought was a welcome side effect compared to anxiety and insomnia but now this is really starting to lower my mood again,
When I was at the beginning of my illness and was unable to function, eating didn't even enter my head and I lost around a stone and a half (my usual weight sticks around 10 - 10 1/2 stone) to 9 stone, I looked really unwell at this weight, but since being on mirtazapine I have gained 2 1/2 stone in the first month (I'm into my second month now) and it's just staying there. I have tried changing my diet and exercising but I'm stuck at nearly 12 stone.
I look overweight, none of my clothes fit me and the worse part is that I look 6 months pregnant and because I am only just venturing out again after months of solitude, a lot of people think that I am pregnant and that's why they haven't seen me, I'm struggling to keep my smile and tell people I'm not as I am infertile and this has been one of the issues that led to my depression in the first place.
I'm not sure if anyone can help, I guess I'm just looking for advise on losing the weight or whether I should change my meds (again!!!!)

"Hello, for about two years I've been suffering from some sort of sciatica all down my right side and occasionally left. This pain is worsened quite a lot when sitting for long periods of time. I've tried stretching pretty much everything in that area including the muscles and the sciatic nerve itself.
This originally happened as a result of sumo dead-lifting. I've continued to dead-lift instead conventional and it has not worsened my sciatica at all.
I really doubt that muscle weakness could be the cause of this.
I've been to physical therapy, the chiropractor, I've even asked doctors but none of their suggestions help.  
Wasn't sure if I should post this in brain and nerve or muscle and joints either seems like it would work.
I hope the answers will help other people going through this annoying s**t. I'll be happy to compensate if someone helps.

I gained back all the weight I wanted to gain back and Im at my original weight, and I DO NOT want to gain anymore. Ive decided to try to stop taking the mirt all together because I dont want to gain anymore weight, but I think it was really helping me feel better. Ive only been on it for a month. If I dont give in to cravings, eat healthy, and exercise, will I continue to gain weight? I want to stop taking the drug altogether... but I dont know how these withdrawl symptoms are going to play out. It's been two days and I feel pretty dizzy/sick and more anxious, but I heard it's easier to stop when you havent been taking it too long and it's already a low dose. My doctor told me that if Im feeling better, to stop taking it for a week and see how I feel and restart it if I have any issues.
I guess Im wondering how long these withdrawl symptoms are going to last when I was only on it for a short amount of time, or If i should start taking it again.

"Hi all, I’ve posted on here before about coming off Mirtazapine, I successfully withdrew from Mirtazapine a few weeks ago but the rebound anxiety was too much and I caved and took 7.5mg again which I dropped back down to 3.75mg but started not being able to sleep. I have now upped it to 7.5mg again and I’m feeling awful.
Lately I’ve been getting a funny feeling sometimes when I stand, like a pounding in my head and ears which is causing severe health anxiety, I’m also getting wrinkly fingertips but I think it might be more when I’m cold, it’s really uncomfortable and it gets worse when I stretch my fingers out, looks like the big dents in my finger tips. 
The head issue seems to get worse in the afternoons, I’m struggling with pains all over my body too, heart palpitations, internal tremors, fatigue and muscle soreness and I’m sure it’s the medication but I just can’t seem to get off these meds...

"I have found that it is helped me sleep and I take just 7.5 mg at bedtime takes about an hour to get sleepy and then I sleep 7 to 8 hours pretty well. Something I haven't done for a very long time since before my heart surgery February 2018. I was a little nervous about starting on a medication but the anxiety insomnia and just obsessing about my health was really getting to me. It's taking about 2 weeks for things to kind of even out for me. Anxiety is better and my sleep is better and since I have lost a lot of weight after surgery my appetite has improved which is a plus. Hope that's helpful to other people that maybe this wasn't such a scary drug to try. But of course the doctor that ordered it said it was a sub therapeutic dose that I said I wanted to start it and see how I did. Good luck to everybody else

I dont really post, but I since have read about all this weight gain with mirtazapine from everyone, I am wondering if its a case of ""You only hear bad news and nobody ever wants to rave about how sucessfull the drug is"". Kind of like watching the evening news. Its always about murder, terrorism and disaster. Never about happy amazing changes in the world.
Anyways, I currently take
-Dexamphetamine 25mg daily
(ADD stimulant medication for my ADD that i have taken for 10 MONTHS, i never used to treat my ADD and had panic attacks since a teen before stimulant medication).
Clonazepam/Klonopin 0.25mg to 0.5mg daily (for panic attacks and have also been on this for 10 MONTHS.)
I have suffered panic attacks and depression for well over a decade and I have tried ;
Prozac,
citalopram,
zoloft,
Pristiq,
Luvox,
reboxetine,
strattera,
bupropion,
cymbalta,
antispychotics,
and im sure i am missing a few.
Non of them helped anxiety and non ever touched my depression.
The only thing thats helped my anxiety is the klonopin/clonazepam,
but i dont want to stay on this forever as i know its addictive, dependant and I know it causes brain/memory problems and increases dementia risk. + it is acfually making me more depressed.
More background.
I also have eating disorders and obsess over my weight. Being fat =severe depression. So its not an option for me.
Im wondering how many people dont gain weight on this? and how long were/are you on it for? I was reading diet and exercise doesnt help either because the drug changes the way you store fat etc increase appetite.
Also, is anyone else taking it alongside an ADHD med and find that the ADHD med counteracts the weight gain side effect and they dont gain weight?
I am currently a ""healthy"" weight, but am at the highest end of ""healthy"", so a 4lb gain will drop me in the 'just' overweight category, so in other words, i cant afford the extra lbs.
I have started Mirtazapine last night at half a 15mg tab (7.5mg) and it made me groggy, and this morning when i woke i felt spacey. I know this isnt a theraputic dose for anxiety etc, but im going to work my way up slowly.
Thanks for all of your help guys =)

"Hey guys,
I've been on 30mg of Mirtazapine for one year and right now I'm weaning off them. I'm currently on 15mg, and have been taking that for a few days. I'd like to hear about your experience with having vivid dreams whilst being on this med. Nearly every night since taking this pill my dreams have felt INCREDIBLY real. They're not crazy or violent, but they are weird/a little twisted. They usually involve people I know. Even hours after waking up I still think about my dream and the details of it. Even since dropping to 15mg my dreams are still life-like and detailed.
When I wasn't taking any medication, I rarely used to dream. Well, maybe I did... I just never remembered them. But now, WOW! I could write a book on the dreams I've had. And the weird thing is... I love it! It's cool to have such realistic and memorable dreams.

"i was on mirtazapine 7.5mg for 2 weeks and was great....but i wanted to be better and my anxiety to completely go away so then 15 mg for about a week, had all the horrible side effects, i was irritable, angry and started having panic attacks. i havent had one for ages until i started taking these! then went back to 7.5mg, was ok for a few days then on the 5th or so day i had another panic attack. went off on cold turkey monday, started prozac that same  day..woke up last night with heart pacing and anxiety, burning dehydrated feeling...when i woke up i popped a prozac, felt panicky during lunch...went away then at 830 till 1am ive been having full flown anxiety on and off., i feel cracked out but groggy.like less of my hand motor control and facial twiching? i dont know.i feel out of body. i think this is from the remoron withdrawl.. what is currently helping me is DOING things to keep my mind out of it. i started CLEANING and organizing  things arond the house and it sounds silly but it helped me A LOT. i think some of our anxiety comes from us moping around and not having anything to release that energy into. i get anxious when i am idle. im actually pretty sleepy right now bc i was cleaning, i havent had sleep issues yet. i was actually able to take a nap both days. 
I also think theres a few triggers in my diet that is causing the attacks..SUGAR & CAFFEINE & SPICY FOOD.
Has anyone been able to quit cold turkey? Can you tell me about your experience..I will update mine..

"Hi I have just started Remeron for  mainly severe chronic insomnia and am Adult ADD. I have tried almost every other sleep medication out there.  My Dr. said   this should definitely help me sleep. On low dose 15mg. but may gain weight. She said I may escape that trap if I am dilligent due to being very active, such a low dose and mainly because I am on 30mg Vyvance daily..  I took my first dose  last night and WOW...k, I am 58 and come from the days of has brownies. lol That is all I can equate it to, but boy did I sleep.  So far today the Vyvance is doing it's thning and I am not craving more food than normal. Please tell me there is someone out there that has not gained an enormous amount of weight because that will make me depressed even though I am taking it for anxiety and not depression. I realize I will have to be dilligent about it.  But best nights sleep I have had in Years. Ambien makes me eat constantly until I go to bed and the next day I feel almost suicidal so that is out.  Benzos of course are heaven but i build up a tolerance quickly. As my insomnia is chronic I need something I can take nightly and you can't with benzos but lord do I wish you could. They relax me without making me feel different. I have tried other antidepressants  for anxiety and insomnia and none other have worked.  I have read that many people with add turn to Remeron.  I am hoping I have finally found a  med that works.  Has anyone maintained their weight? Also is there anyone else out there with ADULT ADD taking it? Would love to hear from you. Thanks

"Hi again everyone! 
You may or may not have seen me post before about Mirtazapine weight gain. Well, I took some of yours advice and while I was on 15mg I stayed around 60kg (which is still a little much for me) and I was okay with it. 
Well this all changed when I went on 30mg. One, my cravings were worse than ever l i t e r a l l y could not stop myself eating and it HAD to be carbs! I’m on my first month on 30, third week I’m pretty sure, and the cravings went down in the past three days or so and I’ve been eating less and snacking on fruit if I did need to do so. But I gained 2kg in these days? I just do not understand how that makes sense. 
Well, this has started to seriously put me down as I don’t even fit my clothes anymore and I’m very short so really I don’t like having to buy larger sized jeans because they’re way too long for me, being the size that I was really suited me and I was happy with it. Now that that’s gone because of Mirtazapine, I am feeling so down and self-conscious that I was even embarrassed to go to my job interview thinking they’re not gonna like how I look (stupid, yes I know). 
Long story short, for those of you who don’t feel like reading it all, I have been on Mirtazapine for 4 months now and the weight gain is putting me down so much that I am looking to come off of it. I have already got a GP appointment for Wednesday but I’m wondering if the doctor will let me switch and what to possibly?

"Hi,
Its been 10 days since I upped my mirtazapine from 45 to 60 to get rid of some anxiety which I had left based on my psychiatrists recommendation. However I do not feel better if not I feel a bit worse. More depressed and my appetite has also went down a bit. Debating on going back down to 45 or still sticking with it. My doc says it could take 2 to 3 weeks before I see the effects of the 60 but right now just feeling so blah and unmotivated. Don't know what to do cause I know 45 mg was not fully helping me either...but really don't want to add a 2nd antidepressant. Please help any advice or experiences would be much appreciated.

"Hi all,
I’ve been on 45mg of Mirtazapine for just over 4 years now. I was prescribed it for my depression, anxiety, insomnia and critical low weight. It extremely helped with all those areas, and my life became a much easier thing to deal with because of this drug. Though, my weight seemed to stay the same. 
Only recently I’ve been rapidly gaining weight after 4 years of being on it. Over 10kgs (22lbs) in just a few months!! 
I was a heavy marijuana smoker for majority of those 4 years, and recently gave up several months ago. I’m wondering if the marijuana was holding back the common side effect of weight gain and all of a sudden I’m being impacted by this side effect. 
The weight gain is seriously affecting my mood now, and suddenly I’m feeling depressed again. I’m seeing my doctor this week to discuss the possibility of coming off it. 
I’m just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience? Especially in the long term, because the only experiences of weight gain I found online is with short term usage.
Thanks for any help!

"hi all, i've been coming off mirtazapine under community mental health team.
Been on mirtazapine for over 6 years, mostly 15mg for sleep but recently 30mg and then 45mg for depression. wasn't working so psych said to drop from 45mg to 15 mg overnight. wasn't sure but she insisted.
never had mania before, i went manic 5 days after the drop and they said go back to 30mg, took a week to stop mania/hypomania (no psychosis). got over that, 2 weeks later they said to drop to 15mg, was ok apart from headaches/diarrhea/sleep disturbance,  week later dropped to 7.5mg for 3 days, then 0mg, the week after went manic, then crashed the next day, went up again manic yesterday crashed the same day, now i feel like i've had my power cable unplugged.
also been having normal discontinuation stuff like cracking headache, diarrhoea, thirst, nightmares, no appetite, sleep disturbance,muscle tension and dizziness and weirdly one  spontaneous orgasm, but compared to the mania/hypomania/crashing its nothing.
they gave me some diazepam but i don't want to take it because they want me to get a medication free baseline period and i don't want to mask symptoms.
 they're saying its a rare discontinuation syndrome but haven't said how long it will last. i called them yesterday to tell them the mania was back but they didn't call me back and now its the weekend. tbh i'm getting a bit scared and not sure what to do. each high seemed to be a few days after a drop in the mirtazapine and i've had a high after the drop to 0mg now, so i'm hoping this will be the last one.
have any of you experienced this before? there's not much on the internet or in the scientific research papers.
thanks

"Hi, I'm 39 and was prescribed mitazapine in November Ly, to help with the awful withdrawal effects from dosulopin that I had been taking for over 20 yrs, I was on mirtazapine at the highest dose to help with insomnia it took a while to sort but it worked and I kinda felt great, except I would get awful restless legs that would literally keep me up all night, to resolve that I took painkillers that helped, but not only did I slowly gain weight my mood changed it when down hill and I have become very distant, Moody suicidal (thoughts) and argumentative, my partner took the brunt and I went from being bubbly but anxious to a person even I did not like, I feel like my world is falling apart, after 6 yrs in a happy relationship we have almost split up twice in 2 months, we don't laugh any more when I'm at work i can put an act on but as soon as I'm at home all I want to do is sleep or be on my own, we have just come back from a lovely holiday abroad and I hated every minute of it, and I know this all due to this awful drug, I am now day 4 into cold turkey and nobody knows I feel ok so far, has anyone else had a bad reaction to this, I was so desperate I wanted to go back onto the dosulopin,but as I say I'm convinced it's the m irtazapine.

Bad Dreams have gone, only to be replaced with severe dizziness to the point of feeling like I'm going to pass out.  That too is slowing down, new symptom as of two days ago a Cracked Tongue due to my mouth being so dry.  I drink about 2 litres of water a day but a sore tongue hurts like hell.  Guessing this to will pass but I'm opting out.  This drug certainly helped cause I haven't felt nearly as edgy as I was.  Sticking with my 225mg of Venlafaxine and will see how I go over the next week or so.  This is the best place for advice will certainly be back.

"I'm a 49 year old male. 18 months ago my doctor suggested I try anti -depressants to control symptons of anxiety. At the time I was feeling quite low and dissillusioned, although I wouldn't say I was depressed. I have had panic attacks over the years since my early teens so I guess I am prone to being at the mercy of my mind despite my best efforts to control it. Panic attacks were not frequent - they seemed to arrive about every 7 years and effect me on and off for a couple of weeks - the first one on each occasion being the worst, which would build gradually and then completely floor me for twenty excruciating minutes before lifting. In recent years though more constant anxiety symptons seemed to have taken the place of the panic attacks. These were numerous - classic and extreme vertigo, nausea, sharp (but not agonising) chest pains, fatigue, heart burn ( for which I have been taking 20 mg of Omeprazole daily for the last 6 years), indigestion and feelings of suffocation. Shortly after a family bereavement I started to suffer from Globus Sensation (the feeling of something trapped or lodged in the throat), and it was only with this that a doctor I was seeing at the time felt that everything I was experiencing was down to anxiety. I was offered councelling - which I accepted - and it helped to a certain degree, but the numerous symptons would always come back. I should say that I am also asthmatic so Globus Sensation and the associated suffocation feeling can make it hard to know exactly what is happening and what is the best remedy. Just the act of breathing becomes the all consuming thought. Also I fully accept that a combination of ashtma and globus can lead to a lot of worry which in itself spirals and the anxiety of that only makes globus worse. Sometimes for up to an hour my mind gets the worst of me and it's only afterward when the globus sensation has lessened that I can look at things more realistically. Because of the globus I decided to try an anti-depressant after my new doctor suggested it. I reinterate that I was not feeling depressed but wanted to get on top of the physical symptoms of anxiety - which increasingly felt like they were ruling my life, making me withdrawn and also rather self possessed. I suppose that was enough to make me feel low - being less connected with friends etc, but I really didn't ever feel like harming myself or anything like that. The first anti-depressant I tried was Sertraline. I had some fairly severe side effects in the first couple of weeks - disorientation, nausea, nightmares, sweats, but it did settle. However after just a few days it created a sexual disfunction in that I could not reach orgasm. I stayed on the drug for about 3 months though. In all that time the sexual disfunction remained. Friends however, did appear to notice an improvement in my mood and my ability to engage with them again. Unfortunately I could not live with the side effect and my doctor said there were other options that were less likely to effect sexual function. After tapering off of Sertraline and a short period without any antidepressant I started Mirtazapine. First at 15mg, moving up to 30 mg after a few weeks. There were no evident side efects. When asked if I felt any positive effects after 3 months I could not honestly say I felt any different. My doctor pointed out though, that I might notice the difference If I stopped. Unsure of this I said I was willing to carry on seeing as I didn't feel that there were any negative effects. I have now been on Mirtazapine for close to a year, I still get globus, the odd chest pain and heart burn (if I neglect the Omeprazole). The problem is, that very gradually I have reallised I have had a loss of libido. With Sertraline the effect was so immediate and frustrating (failing to reach orgasm) that it was very obvious. With Mirtazapine the ability to achieve orgasm is still there, but a slow decline in interest has become increasingly evident. I had wondered if this was just a natural state of affairs for a man approaching 50, so I did see my doctor about this. She assured me that there was no reason that my age should play much if any part in a lack of libido and she suggested a blood test to check on my level of testosterone. The result came back at '9' - low testosterone is considered 1 to 8, normal is considered 9 to 18. So my testosterone is at the low end of normal. I am now being referred to a specialist in male sexual health who will consider whether the Mirtazapine is the cause of my lack of libido. I have never been tested for testosterone before this so I don't know what my level might have been previously, but I'm guessing that as it is something I myself noticed and brought to the attention of my doctor, that my testosterone was higher before. It's not just libido, it's my passion for everything in life feeling less acute. 
I am giving serious consideration to stopping the Mirtazapine for, as stated above, many of the anxiety symptoms remained anyway. My doctor is concerned that coming off of anti-depressants might put me into a more depressed state, or that my anxiety might get the better of me to a far more crippling degree than before. I will wait for the specialists opinion but I am hoping that I can taper off of Mirtazapine without major withdrawal problems - I live alone so I'm a bit worried that if I do have a depressive reaction to coming off of the drug there's nobody around to talk me around or reassure me. If I can come off it without too many problems I think I will still have benefitted from the fact that it may have helped me look at the wider view around the things that cause my anxiety - even if many of the symptoms remained. I have to say though that I have never really found it easy to work out what does cause me anxiety - I always thought I was quite laid back and not up-tight at all and often it's only months after that I can look back and see that things I felt I was coping with were in fact knawing away at me little by little - giving me this now almost constant globus sensation in place of the infrequent but dramatic panic attacks.
I have agreed to try Cognative Behavioural Therapy as an alternative option - although my lack of passion and enthusiasm, and natural cynicism might be a big stumbling block there.
If anyone has experience of lack of libido or a decrease in testosterone through taking Mirtazapine I would be grateful for any further insights. Ie, do you put lack of sexual drive down to depression/anxiety or the antidepressant drug?

"Hi All.  I was on Mirtazapine for about a month.  I had a bad experience with the drug.  It did help me to sleep for the first couple weeks and my appetite was noticeably improved shortly after taking the drug.  I was losing a lot of weight and was one of the primary reasons I was put on this drug.  Within a few days of taking the drug, I was literally going into the kitchen every 30 minutes to snack on Triscuits, cookies and any other snack available.  I was never like this before taking this drug.  I have since discontinued Mirtazapine as I was experiencing a lot of bad side effects.  It has now been 3-4 weeks off the drug, but I still notice my appetite is on overdrive.  They say it takes some antidepressants (ADs) a couple weeks to be effective as it takes time to upregulate brain receptors.  I'm thinking there is a similar issue when discontinuing a drug, i.e., it may take some time to down regulate the receptors toward normal.  For those that have discontinued Mirtazapine in the past, did you notice continued increased appetite for a period of time?  Did you appetite ever get back to normal?  Thanks in advance.

"I've been treated with 30 mg of mirtzapine since november, the first week and a half was absolutely euphoric for me but has settled down since then.
This pill has done a lot for me, from general mood and motivation to regaining my ability to work.
however since November I've gained about 30kg(66 lbs) in weight putting me at a definite overweight status, and this is starting to degrade my physical health aswell. I changed my diet and exercise a lot but this doesn't show at all on the scale to my frustration. I've not gained anymore weight for several months now but it seems nothing I do has any effect, good or bad.
It's clear to me that I can't stay on this pill in the long run and that putting off getting off it will only cause my physical health to degrade further, however I look back at myself from before this drug and I'm scared of regressing into that state again.
Question is if there's any other drug that could give me that same good effect as Miro(mood, motivation) without the severe weight gain I experience.
If it's also relevant I'm also treated with 225mg Viepax XR each morning. And have tried several SSRIs to no avail previously

"Hi all,
After a sudden onset of severe anxiety and depression last year, I spent the following month in a vicious cycle, waking every morning with anxiety and dread, lasting most the day, before calming down on the night. This was on and off until I started taking mirtazapine. At first I was stlil getting episodes but gradually over 4 months the episodes dissapeared. I think the drug was working? 
Anyway since I felt 100% again I decided to taper from 15mg to 7.5mg this year. I felt some anxiety for around a day but that went. I settled on 7.5mg for about 3 weeks. I then had another anxiety episode that lasted a week. This subsided then I tapered down to around 3mg. I stayed on this dose for around a week before completely withdrawing. So my total time on Mirtazapine was around 6 months. I had some stomach pains when stopping completely but no anxiety.
3 weeks after stopping the drug, I had another sudden onset of anxiety, this lasted for 3 weeks! I then recovered and spent another 3 weeks feeling great. So that takes us to here. Since friday last week I've been experiencing a return of all my symptoms. Waking up early with extreme anxiety, random crying spells, confusion and a general feeling of being 'broken'. Not to mention a very disrupted and somewhat twisted sleep.
Every time my anxiety hits its always from something that upsets me. Whether it be reading about the death of someone i know about, or something mental health related that reminds me of how ill i was. There is almost always a trigger. This then sends me crashing back down and within 1 day im back to fully blown anxiety and panic.
I don't feel as bad as I was before when I took mirtazapine, but it seems im back to being very sensitive about anything i read or hear. Could I still be experiencing withdrawal? I really dont want to reinstate my dose but my recovery is all over the place at the moment.

"I started off with a very bad case of the shakes tremors tears etc.. Gp gave me diazepam 2mg and then after a week with not a lot of sleep was prescribed mirtazapine.
Is it the case that depression comes from anxiety, as now I don't want to leave the house and feeling like I'm lost and very confused. I am due back to work in a weeks time I'm just hoping things get better...
Anyone with similar symptoms?

"Been on mirtrazapine for 6 months.  Helped me loads.  I went on it due to death of both parents in a matter of months, It helped me eat and sleep.  Weight issue is not a problem as I just could not eat.  Had no appetite.  Anyway trying to come off it slowly.  I'm now on 3/4 of tablet and taking pregablin to help anxiety.  Should I do a drop each month.  This is my first drop to 3/4 of tablet and after a week I feel ok, I am worried about taking this med long term.  Read it can affect your liver levels. and cholesterol.  Anybody had this? That's all that is stopping me from taking this as otherwise its made me, me.

"Hi
I have been on 45mg of mirt for 1 and 1/2 years and don t really feel it helps. It does help me sleep but i wake up constantly. I am on venlaflaxine and diazepam also. For a year now i have had almost daily tension headaches and pain in my left jaw.
I am unsure as to the cause and am having massage and osteopathy to help but i suspect the mirt may be part of it. I want to reduce on a 10 % reduction but i know the withdrawal symptoms are headaches and not sure how i ll cope.
Has anyone else experienced these symptoms after long term use?Also dizziness. Did it improve on reduction ?
I am at my wits end. My life is on hold cos of these physical symptoms and although my mood has improved this is holding my recovery back.
Any experience or advice ?

"Hi all my first post here I am quite an impatient person when it comes to finding things out so hopefully some of you could help me out.
I noticed I had pins and needles in my hands and fingers it felt like it was in random parts of my body to, to begin with.
I went to see the local GP and was prescribed 10mg of amytriplyne a day. And for bloods to be taken the same day.
My pins and needles eased over time from my body but stayed in my hands for exactly 11 days .
When I started taking the tablets it was 7 days from that point.
My bloods only came back that I was vitamin D deficient. And also prescribed 50000 Vit D3 units once a week. Nothing else and assuming diabetes ruled out but we didn't have that discussion. They took alot of blood so I assume they tested for lots of things.
I was 9 days clear of the pins and needles when I saw the doctor next. And he suggested I stop taking the amitriptyline.
3 days on my pins and needles has come back to my hands. And I'm very concerned about this issue and will be booking an appointment in the next few days.
If anyone has any experience about this it would be highly appreciated I just don't see this a normal thing and it's very irritating.
Just to note the only other things I feel that isn't right only to describe I feel like s**t sometimes and just can't be bothered with anything... obviously I still do them I'm assuming lack of energy with a vit d deficiency . I get occasional headaches but always suffered with that. But yeah...
Thank you.

"Hi all,
For about 8 years I was on high doses of Anafranil (225mg) and 15mg of Mirtazapine. I've been slowly reducing the amounts for over a year (!). Now I'm down to only 7.5 mg Mirtazapine. I am feeling a bit better mentally (more color in my life :-)) but am generally feeling very tired. Working full time and being a father of two little children, I am able to get about 7.5 hours of sleep per night (average), but wake up extremely tired and feel that my body needs at least 10 hours... Unfortunately, I just don't have those 10 hours... I am quite the zombie during the day and wondering if anyone else has experienced this, if this is definitely a withdrawal symptome or not? I assume that if this is part of withdawal, I should push forward and get it over with but am a bit afraid to go ahead. I remember, many years back, when I was on Mirtazapine only, that it did make me very tired. Funny that with the two drugs together I was less tired than now...
Any advice would be extremely helpful. Thanks!!!

When did Mirtazapine start working for depression for you guys? I used to be on it six years ago and it did help then but it took a few weeks.

"I have a sleep anxiety issue, and I have been taking mirtazapine for 6 months which has worked great. I started on 15mg, then after 4 months I'd noticed I'd gained a lot of weight (normally on the very slim side so was a shock!) 2 stone to be precise. So I cut down to 7.5mg with no issues re sleep. However I was not losing any weight despite trying via food and exercise. My concern was the health effect as well as the physical effect as it increases triglycerides etc.
So I cut down to 3.75mg (quatree of a tablet) and then managed to come off completely for the last 2 weeks.
However my sleep anxiety has returned. I'm very frustrated as thought I could shift some of this weight. Can anyone of you be completely honest with me and tell me if you think 3.75mg can cause weight gain/reduce ability to lose weight? I'm hoping to take every other night when I get back into a good sleep routine.
Thank you

I am a week in taking the Remeron and am already noticing an increase in hunger.
My psychiatrist had suggested I take Buspar and a low dose of Prozac if the Remeron does not work or I cannot handle the side effects.
Should I keep trying the Remeron despite the hunger or just go with the Buspar at this point? I am having a very hard time mentally and am running out of patience to feel better...

"Hi guys I have had severe insomnia for 8 months, tried all the over the counter stuff, herbs etc. Nothing worked. Tried Zopiclone but was scared only 1 pill would not work so first night I took 2 (15mg) and I got 8 hours uninterrupted sleep. Felt great the next day but my doctor only gave me 7 pills so soon used them up.
Anyway for the past month I have been drinking alcohol every night to get to sleep and whilst alcohol knocks me out (if I drink enough) I've become more and more depressed and find it hard to enjoy life, I guess regular alcohol consumption is the culprit as alcohol is a strong depressant?
This evening I went to the doctor and explained things and he gave me Mirtizipine 15mg a night to try, my question is do these work as well as sleeping tablets? I've heard great things said about them that first some people they are even more sedating than the hypnotic z drugs (Zopiclone, Zolpidem).
Thanks.

"Hi, im new to this forum, I want to ask how to wean off from 7.5mg mirtazapine safely by not suffering from wd symptoms.  I started on 15mg last april and stayed for 3 weeks before cutting to 7.5mg. I made a mistake of stopping at 7.5mg after 4 days.  I was fine for a week then suddenly felt flulike symptoms, feeling cold and having sweats on and off. also muscle aches and itchiness.  after suffering for 2 nights i reinstated to 7.5mg, then all my symptoms slowly went away after a week. now ive been on 7.5mg for 2 weeks.  I plan to stay for another week before weaning down to 6.75 or maybe 6.5mg.  Is this safe? can i just crush 15mg tab, dissolve in 15ml water and take 6.75ml? or do i need to use a suspension? any advise will be appreciated.....thank you

"Hi everyone
I'm new to this forum and am hoping some of you may be able to tell me positive stories that can allay my fears. As a result of major depression after having my first child, I've been on paroxetine for about 10 years, mostly only around 10 mg/day, intermittently 20 when I've had bad episodes, which have been getting more frequent over the years. (I also see a therapist - that's ongoing.) Recently a series of very tough life events sent me back into a major depression, with suicidal wishes, and the various people I've seen - don't ask me exactly who, I get very confused about the different roles of various NHS mental health professionals - have advised a change to Mirtazapine. The thought is that the paroxetine has probably stopped working, plus I have constant sleeping difficulties with which Mirtazapine should help. I start 15 mg/day Mirtazapine on Monday and after a week of that along with my normal 10 mg paroxetine, I drop out the paroxetine, and a week later we review the Mirtazapine dosage. I've been warned, and read, that when you first start Mirtazapine you can be VERY sleepy. To be honest I wouldn't mind this for a while, I have a big sleep debt to make up, but I' wouldn't want it to go on too long. I know no drug suits everyone so please if Mirtazapine's not suited you don't tell me as I'm scared about the change already! But if you have a positive story please do tell me as then I'll feel less scared. Thank you for any support and help.

"Hi,
Recently got diagnosed with adjustment disorder due to being diagnosed with wegners last year, with GAD and major depressive disorder as a secondary diagnosis. Symtoms initially we're lack of appetite, stomach in knots in the, no energy, did not feel like moving from the couch, and just crying. Went to the hospital several times because never felt this way before. After going to the hospital a few times and getting all kinds of tests done with no bad results asked to speak to a psychiatrist. Was put on 7.5 mg mirtazapine and felt myself within a week...than about 2 to 3 weeks later one day just woke up not feeling like me...lost my appetite again, began feeling like doing nothing just sitting on the couch ..no energy. They uped my dose to 15mg... appetite slowly came back after a week and only really felt like me in the evenings and night. Mornings slowly started to improve but still rough...waking up feeling just not like myself....blah with a nervous feeling in my stomach. So they uped my dose to 30mg after going on the 15mg for 2 weeks. Took the 30 last night and again mornings became rough..just not feeling not right....is it normal to regress when uping the dose???? I think that every time I feel off I just start panicking that that awful feeling us coming back or wegners is showing it's ugly head again.....I've never suffered from anxiety or depression before so this is all new. I just don't understand how completely normal I felt on the 7.5 mg of mirtazapine than one day snap I just regressed.

"Hi.  First time poster. I am taking Fluoxetine, 20 mg, currently 1.875 mg of mirtazapine and Ativan (0.5 mg) as needed.  I recently came off of low dose risperidone.   I was put on mirtazapine as I was having trouble sleeping and my appetite was very low.  I lost about 40+ lbs in about 1.5 months.  Mirtazapine has made me hungry (at least my weight has stabilized) and it has made me sleep ok (but not great), but the side effects are killing me.
I am feeling a lot of weird effects on mirtazapine and was wondering if others may feel the same.  First night I took the drug (7.5 mg), I experienced restless legs.  My Pdoc wanted me to up the dose, which I did to 11 mg and felt RLS again.  I thereafter reduced my dose to 7.5 and have continued down.  I have been on 1.875 mg for about 4 days days and then discontinuing this horrible drug likely tonight.
I also have experienced restless arms, specifically my left arm.  My left hand feels uncoordinated and I notice a slight hand tremor.  I have recently started having brain zaps, which feel like a muscle twitch or worse like you are jolted with electricity - usually comes on if I am nodding off - I think they call these hypnic jerks).  I wake up every morning with nausea and a jittery feeling like I've had too much coffee.  I had akathisia on rispridone, which was one the reasons I discontinued.  On mirtazapine, I still feel some inner restlessness, but the dose now is so low I just can't understand why this is the case.  It may be the case that I am undergoing risperidone withdrawal as I have only been off this drug for about 5 days (even though I was tapering at a very low dose).
Mirtazapine makes me feel extremely unmotivated and anti-social.  I just want to hang out on my recliner all day with a heating pad and surf the internet.  I am on ST disability at the moment and this drug is not helping me to get back to work. 
I will be discontinuing Mirtazapine tonight.  For those who have gotten off this drug, I welcome your comments and insight, particularly as to how long the withdrawal symptoms last.  I should point out that I have only been taking Mirtazapine for 1 month and was mostly on 7.5 mg for that time.  My hope is that the low dose and time taking the drug will minimize withdrawal symptoms.  My Pdoc thinks I'm still taking 3.5 mg, but I've decided to take my health into my own hands at this point.  I just can't function on this drug.  Thanks in advance and I hope to hear from members of this group.  This is a scary time for me healthwise and I often wonder if I will get back to normal free of all these psyche meds.  Thanks.

"Hi.  I would be curious to know what others have used for treating insomnia once off of Mirtazapine.  I was getting about 5-7 hours of sleep a night.  I can't say it was restful sleep as I would often wake up feeling nauseated and jittery.  I have Ativan (0.5 mg tabs), which I can take, but I would prefer not to go down that road if I can help it.  I've been told all these Z-drugs (Ambien, etc.) are horrible.  I would be interested in alternative, possibly ore natural sleep aids, e.g., melatonin, some people have claimed magnesium helps.  What about over the counter meds such as Nytol or Sominex?  I would really appreciate your feedback during this difficult time.  Thanks!

"Hi all, I was put on Mirtazapine 30mg in January this year... I was put up slowly just given the whole 30mg and wasn’t able to budge... I was in a Mother Baby Unit for PTSD, Depression & Anxiety they also used to give me benzos at my request but I was already so drowsy 2 weeks of being a zombie and the 30mg didn’t help with my insomnia at all, after I was discharged I went to my Dr and I said I can’t handle this fatigue my body wants to sleep 15 hours a day minimum - she suggested coming off it in 3 days so I halved a tablet and got brain zaps immediately. Went back and told her and she said to slowly taper even though I was only on it 6-7 weeks in total... Anyway my taper was very slow and I took my last dose last Tuesday the first 2 days were fine and I was happy, able to go get my haircut which is a huge deal with most people that suffer anxiety so you now what I mean! I felt pretty good on 7.5mg & 3.75mg started exercising and felt generally happy... Well now my anxiety is back not as bad as it was but my mind is obsessing over my heart and the rate, how it feels, oh god did it just miss a beat... You get my drift... I’m trying so hard to fight it because I know I’m fine even though I feel like anxious brain is now convincing rational brain otherwise... This insomnia, anxiety & nausea is debilitating... I’m also experiencing weird brain stuff... only way to explain it is if I lay down and close my eyes my mind goes blank & my hearing goes only to come back suddenly it’s horrendous... Or it feels like my mind is pulling itself apart with thought... I woke up 3 times last night and was unable to stop thinking... How long will this last? 
Should I go back to 3.75mg?
I’m also experiencing tingling, pins & needles and feelings of getting a flu which might be from lack of sleep. 
I’m terrified of Drs now because I feel they just ignore me, they send my anxiety through the roof. I wanted to get Melatonin but you can’t get it in Australia without a script... Stupid I know! Please help xx

"I finally stopped remeron in July 2016. I had been on 30mg for about 4 years and took over a year to very slowly taper off due to the withdrawal symptoms. Almost immediately (~2 weeks) after I was completely done, I started getting chronic headaches. I've had a headache 24/7 ever since and am to the point I don't even remember what it's like to not have pain. I've been to 10+ doctors and none of them have found anything that could be causing them (chiropractors, accupunturist, physical therapists, osteopath, pain management doctors, rheumatologists, oralfacial pain surgeon/neurologist, ENT & geneticist). I've tried all kinds of treatments with little to no relief.
Given the onset was directly after I stoped remeron, is it possible it's some kind of long-term withdrawal symptom??

"I have been taking 20 mg Paroxetine for 18 years. During that time I have experienced 4 reoccurring episodes of Anxiety and Depression lasting between 4-6 weeks. I was prescribed Mirtazapine 30mg 3 years ago by GP and after 6 weeks was fully recovered and completely well for a year and then experienced another episode of Anxiety and Depression. The Mirtazapine dose was increased to 45mg and within 4 weeks I was completely well again for another year. I am now experiencing another episode of Anxiety and Depression. I was prescribed Lorazepam 1mg by another GP which I was told I could take for 6 weeks but this didn't help and I suffered awful side affects. My GP has advised me to wean off Paroxetine and Lorazepam over the next couple of weeks so I am just taking Mirtazazapine to see if this helps. I may have to take a different antidepressant alongside the Mirtazapine if needed. Gp thinks Paroxetine is no longer affective. I have had so much time of work because of Anxiety and Depression. I just want to get myself completely weIl and fully recovered so I don't experience any more reoccurring episodes of this.
Has anyone else experienced anything similar with these medications!
Would be really great to hear of your experiences!

"I have just increased my Mirtazapine from 30 mg to 45 mg. I know it's only the second day but I am having the most horrendous experience. Can anyone tell me if they had this experience. I have now gone from 15 to 45 mg. The only drug that really worked for me was Venlafaxine which I took off and on for over ten years. Unfortunately in October 2012 it stopped working. I was then tried on double the dose followed by Sertraline but to no avail. In April 2013 I asked if I could try Van. again and it worked from April until September 2013. The 15 mg of Mirtazapine worked fantastically for about two and half months but then stopped working. I was on 30 mg for 8 weeks and still felt bad so GP suggested the 45 mg.

"Hi guys! I had the best sleep of my life on Mirtazapine(7.5 mg) for 2 years. I messed up with the dosage while trying to come off it and I had the worst insomnia in the life. It caused anxiety and I started taking it again but it is not helping me with sleep now. I waited for an year thinking that it will work again. As it was not working my new doctor added clonazepam 0.25mg and trazadone 50 mg upped the mirt dose to 15 mg. I am sleeping better (5 hrs) atleast 4 times a week but I miss my old days when mirtazapine was working well for me. Sometimes I regret that why did I even thought of tapering the pill when I was doing so well on it.
My concerns :
- Most of the doctors don't know how to make it work again.
- I read somewhere that people develop tolerance to anti histamine and no other sedative antidepdessants will work now as most of them induce sleep by their anti histamine mechanism.
-And the question of the day is that if there is any way I can make mirt working again.?
Guys I know doctors are the best people to answer but they don't seem to be helpful as of now.

"While withdrawing from mirtazapine(7.5 mg) last year I had a rebound insomnia. Also there was a traumatic event in my life which made my insomnia worse. Raising up the mirt dose(11.25 mg) didn't help. I was unable to perform at my work place. I started having memory issues and anxiety was at it's peak but i was able to come off it. Then I decided to quit my job and came to United States for higher studies. I again started mirtazapine(15 mg) and clonazepam(0.25) and it worked for 2 days but lack of sleep hygiene made my anxiety worse and I couldn't sleep but kept taking it. In February I added trazadone and my sleep is better but not as good as when I first started mirtazapine.
I wanna get my older sleep. Is there any way to make mirtazapine work again? I was thinking to come off it and then start again for the desired results. Any thoughts?

"Hi, I've been prescribed Propanolol for anxiety, 10mgs twice a day. I have been on this for just over a week now. Since the 7th day of taking, I felt exhausted to the point where it was an effort to walk and I had to go to bed. My psychiatrist has suggested cutting the dose in half and I am taking 5mgs twice a day, using a tablet cutter to cut the tablets. Has anyone else had these symptoms of complete exhaustion on Propanolol? I am in complete despair. Additionally, am taking Mirtazapine 11.25mgs (cutting down from 15mgs) and Citalopram 40mgs.

"I’ve been on for a little over 2 months, and I gained 15 kg (or 33lbs). To be fair, right before I went on I did lose a lot of weight (13 lbs) just because of my depression, so overall I guess it’s 20 lbs. Anyway, it’s getting warmer here now and I don’t feel very comfortable with my body. I’ve started excercising etc and so far lost 10 lbs, but it’s quite difficult because I constantly feel hungry and eat at least twice as much as I used to. I know weight gain is a common side effect of Mirtazapine, so I was wondering how others deal with it? Like did you just ignore it and lost the weight when you went off, or did you exercise and count calories? Are there any tips, like any snacks or foods that make you feel full for longer so that you eat less overall? 
Thanks!

I am slowly weaning off mirtazapine but I know the withdrawals are messing with me so my doc suggested adding Nortriptyline into my nightly meds.
All the research I find say to cross-taper cautiously, and that is raising some red flags.
I'm currently on about 12 mg of mirtazapine and am supposed to start 5 mg of nort this evening. I have a toddler so I'm afraid that the combo will be way too sedative.

"2 weeks ago I was prescribed Mirtazapine by my doctor for depression. I took the first 2 doses as instructed, but began to fill unwell so stopped taking it, as I was unsure whether it was the Mirtazapine or a viscous cold I had been exposed to, and I didn't want to be suffering from the cold and side effects at the same time. Turns out it was the cold. However,I have been suffering from a sense of derealisation ever since. I've been back to the Dr twice who put it down to an inner ear inflammation caused by the cold virus, as I was presenting with dizziness, nausea and disorientation, although I'm beginning to think I felt like that because of the derealisation, instead of separate symptoms. I have another appointment booked with the Dr next week where I am going to discuss this with him further, but in the meantime I'm torn between restarting the Mirtazapine, in case it was the stopping it that caused the derealisation, or not giving it another go because it seems like either way, it was the Mirtazapine that caused the derealisation, and I don't want to prolong it going away. Not really sure what I expect to achieve by posting this though. Just feels good getting it off my chest to people who might understand what I'm going through.

"Hi, I have been taking 30 mg mirtazapine since March. Today my doctor prescribed me 45 mg. I take it for panic disorder and general anxiety plus depression. I have a fear of vomitting. If I feel sick I start to have a panic attack. So right now I feel sick and I know it’s from my anxiety. I am really scared to up my dose to 45 mg because I know it can cause nausea. Has anyone had bad nausea when upping to 45mg? I know we are all different but I like to know the fact other people haven’t felt sick while upping mirtazapine. I’m not scared of any other side effects except the nausea part. Please help and calm me down. I am suppose to take it tonight and I am scared.

"Hi all.
So a little back story if you haven’t seen my previous post. I’ll also preface this by adding that I am SEVERELY emetophobic. So I have to be careful with weaning as everyone seems to throw up from withdrawals and that’s not something I can have happen. 
I started mirtazapine in March 2017. I wasn’t eating or sleeping, I was housebound and having multiple panic attacks a day before I was prescribed mirtazapine. 
Once I got on it, I slowly began sleeping and eating. Fast forward to this year, I had gained 32 pounds from this med. The highest dose I took was 22.5 mg and I didn’t feel like it did much of a difference. So after a couple months I’m sitting around 12 mg. The past couple of weeks I’ve definitely felt off. At night before the mirt kicks in I feel almost seasick. 
Five weeks ago this Friday I changed my diet completely. I am eating clean, officially full vegetarian and taking an iron supplement due to low iron levels [all discussed and okay by PCP], as well as exercising almost daily.  I have lost 6 pounds since the change. 
The panic attacks are creeping back in and my phobia is really bad again. I’m afraid to drive far distances and my phobia is starting to dictate my life like it used to. Since I’m a photographer and a mother this is a big issue for me. I can’t be cooped up like this. 
Any other emets in here deal with this? Part of me wants to just jump down to 7.5 mg because I feel like either way I’m gonna feel crappy. I can’t take any SSRIs because of unpleasant side effects and Buspar was bad too. I have zofran but I feel like that’s a gamble as it makes me constipated and I swear sometimes it makes my nausea worse. 
My doctor is on board with whatever I decide and listens to my concerns. She’s not the one who originally prescribed me this med either, she just wants to help me get off of it safely. 
Definitely stuck right now. Not sure if the anxiety is creeping back because of the lower dose or it’s because I’m slowly tapering. I feel like it’s important to remember the state you were in pre mirt, so some of it may not actually be withdrawals? 
When I was on 7.5mg for a while I had no issues dropping to 3.75 mg and sometimes skipping a dose when I was that low. 
Thanks for reading.

"Was admitted to the hospital exactly one week ago. I was on cipralex 10mg , .5 clonazepam. They changed my meds to 10 mg cipralex, dropped the clonazapeam to .25 and added mitraxapine 15 mg.
I experienced heaviness in my arms , last night., a full blown anxiety attack. I was checked by paramedics and they said that is what it was. I am wondering if it was brought on by the new med, the decrease of the clonazapeam.
The pharmacist says to just stop the mitrazpine.I can not even get an appointment with the psychatrist till next week. She does not take calls. I have a family doctors appointment on Friday.I am now fearful to stop or continue. My arms feel much better , just very scared.

"Hi
After several visits to A&E and a collapse at work and the doctors surgery I was finally admitted to hospital 4 weeks ago as they thought there was something wrong with my heart as I had been having near constant palpitations for two weeks!!! anyhow turns out my heart is fine seems that I've got some king of panic disorder - my work are paying for a private councilor to help with that - I'm currently taking 7.5mg of Diazipam daily just to get me through the day - I'm fine if I don't have to go anywhere - also taking beta blockers to slow my heart rate down and I've been prescribed Mirtazapine for the anxiety - at 15mg per night - it does make me sleep but seems to really give me the shakes during the night (maybe thats just the anxiety I dont know) has anyone else experienced this?
I did forget to take a dose last week at the shakes still came on as soon as I started to doze so maybe not related to the mirtazapine - I was shaking alot before I started it to then it was a visible panic shake now its just an inward 'brain' shake' if that makes sense?
The doctors just agreed to up my dose to 30mg nighly at my request as I've started to get depressed sitting at home all day and having to deal with the constant restlessness. Probably just a cycle but I'm wondering if anyone else has felt more restless as their Mirtazapine treament has gone on , I'm tempted to keep taking the 15mg as my body seems to have stopped shaking in the day time and the panic is under control at least while I'm at home - the only real reason why I wanted to up it is to stave of the depression - what does everyone think is three weeks to early to make that decision I've got another weeks supply of the 15mgs left should I just stick it out untill then, touch wood I've not had a panic attack as such in nearly three weeks just feel really shaky and agitated most of the time I dont want to increase the dose and make myself worse especially over the weekend when my GP's is shut.
Is there anyone else out there with similar experiences, prior to this episode I've never been ill enough to visit the doctors in 28 years - no history of depression, even after the panic attacks first started I still wasn't depressed thats come more recently since starting the anti depressants - but guess that could be out of frustration at being so anxious and agitated all the time.
Sorry for the long post - has anyone experienced any negative side effects when increasing their dose of mirtazapine, aside from weight gain which to be honest I'd like I've lost two stone and after three weeks I\""m less hungry than ever.
Answers on a post card. BTW unlike allot of people on Mirtazapine it doesnt knock me out for the whole nite by any means I wake several times shaking. what to do what to..........

I initially went on Mirtazapine 15mg then up to 30mg for anxiety / depression. It helped with the sleeping and depression but my already fuzzy head seemd a lot worse on these tablets.
I asked if I could try another AD, so he put me on Citalopram. What an horrendous reaction (panic, terror, sweats - didn't sleep for 3 days!), he said I had a reaction and so I went back on the Mirtazapine thinking they were my only option.
The anxiety seemed to continue from the Citalopram reaction , symptoms I didn't have before. I have been taking them since.
Iam back at work, but the dizziness is horrible, I keep wanting to fall forward or get slight vertigo is I move my head. Since cutting down to 7mg as Doctor said to come off, that has got better but the waves of anxiety are not nice! (Could be coming off too quick).
The Doctor has prescribed me[b:0b1a13d29b] Dosulepin[/b:0b1a13d29b]. I have read people raving about them and others who don't, I am scared stiff of taking these!
Do all anti depressants fog up your brain, are some worse, can you think clearly on any of them? And do they all have side effects?
I feel I can't go back to the Doctor as he will see me as anxious and paranoid and tell me to see how I get on!
Any advice appreciated - Thank You

"Hi,
After 2 months of Mirtazapine I asked the Doctor to come off. I tapered down to quarter of tablet. A few days after stopping I got Tinnitus noise at the back of my head and left ear which went on for 3 days.
Rang doctors and he said go back on it. The noise went away which is not much use as I am trying to get off it.
Has anyone had tinnutus noise after withdrawing from Mirtazapine and how long did you have it?
Many thanks

"Hi just wonder if anyone has had anything similar.
Was on mirt for maybe 12 months or so. Ended up on 15mg I think (half tab at night). Decided to taper because really groggy exhausted feelings in morning / during the day particularly if I hadn’t got to sleep early (even if I slept a long time).
tapered to 7.5 for a few weeks then stopped. Will note I used tramadol some days for back pain and stopped around a similar time.
Felt fine for 2 weeks without mirt, far better. Then stomach issues began (I do have ibs but haven’t had it like this). Burping, bloating, ibs, upper LH abdominal discomfort. This has been lingering for the past month and GP days IBS but I’ve seen a lot of people withdrawing talk about gastro issues. 
Quite uncomfortable still but I believe symptoms are not as bad but now I am eating low FODMAP but still not great at all - hard to function daily. Anxiety is high and sleep isn’t great, trying to relax as I know this affects digestion but it’s difficult. 
Apitite was very low for a month but coming back now and I’ve lost about 5kg.
Will also mention really tight muscles particularly in back. 
I know it’s all subjective and I have tapered of multiple types of SSRI with nothing similar. Just didn’t expect lengthy issues. Main issues are bloating, feeling of trapped air in stomach, consipation, acid reflux, anxiety.

I thought they are meant to knock you out was hoping to get some sleep . I am wondering whether  citralopram with zopliclone was the better option 
Not that I wanted to take any really but I had insomnia due to stress s situation that can’t really be resolved it’s on going . 
So was put off of zopliclone as it can only be short term my dr put me  on that every two nights so the other two nights no sleep and 10mg citralopram 
So mitrazipine suggested for sleep but listening to the comments feel really worried taking them anyway only had two so far .

"Hi there,
I've been taking 15mg Mirtazapine for about a month now to help with my anxiety issues, unfortunately i'm still suffering from anxiety nausea in the mornings, with occasional vomiting. 
My GP thinks I need to give the medication more time. I've tried Mirtazapine before, and it's been incredibly sedating in the past and really helped with my nausea. 
I've heard that the lower the dosage, the more sedating Mirtazapine is, I said about this to my doctor, and I asked if it would be possible to break my 15mg tablets in two. He said to me 15mg should be sedating enough. 
I've heard that 7.5mg can be sedating too. Does anyone have any experience with 7.5mg?

"Mirtazapine.  I lost 10 months of my life when I stopped taking this drug.
Antidepressants such as mirtazapine need to be taken off the market.  
Whilst I agree that there is a need for drugs that can help people with very difficult periods they experience in their lives, nobody wants to have to take these drugs forever.  The vicious withdrawals that many people suffer when attempting to stop can only mean that they are addictive.  They are addictive because the withdrawals are unbearable and prolonged.    Most GPs dispute this with Mirtazapine 
Definition of addiction: physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance and unable to stop taking it  without incurring adverse effects 
Report this drug.
The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have a system to monitor the effects and safety of medicines and their side effects.
I have submitted a yellow card report detailing the very nasty withdrawal side effects mirtazapine left me with. 
The Yellow Card website is www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard

"Hello good people off this forum. I have finally decided to write about my Mirtazapine troubles after a solid week reading forums. 
As I write this, I am an anxious wreck, 'cyberchondria' of constant googling mirtazapine and withdrawal stories. I have been on 15mg for 5 months, loosely prescribed by a locum doctor in a time of family upheaval (I had to return from abroad following my dad having an accident.) Ironically he is fine now and I am the one with problems. 
I tried tapering 2 weeks ago to 7.5mg, started to feel myself and emotions coming back but the withdrawals hit home soon after in the form of insomnia so I reinstated back to 15mg. Ever since I have become progressively worse, and reading suicide related deaths (robin Williams for instance) to this drug has me terrified. 
I am a 28 year old male, 6 foot and skinny. Mirtazapine has done little for my weight gain. 
I don't know what is up with me the last few days with insomnia, no appetite, scary thoughts and an inability to focus on anything except these forums. 
Sometimes I fear I will have insomnia for life (read that on some website) and sometimes I think 1 or 2 years from my now this will all have been a hellish nightmare. 
I just want to be drug free and live my life like I used to, happy-go-lucky type character. 
Honestly, been depressed in bed for days was much better than been hot-wired with anxiety. 
Tomorrow i will visit my doctor and see what he says, having periously discussed moving from mirtazapine to prozac following a meeting with the mental health team. 
I am lucky, however, that I have the support of my parents who do their best for me. 
From my research I have seen the most positive posts regarding withdrawal are 15mg alternative nights with week 3 taking every third night etc.
In summary compulsive googling, having a taster of withdrawal have my cortisol flooding my brain. Ironic... debilitating anxiety before even withdrawing from an anti-anxiety drug. 
For reference, I have withdrawn from Sertraline, with the main problem being brain zaps. 
Does anybody have any advice for my predicament?

"I'm sure there are lots of threads like this on this forum, but I thought I will feel better if I can hear from people with similar situation to me.
Okay so I'm 30 year old male (fairly healthy with no major problem) and I've been having mild dizzy spells(and feeling a bit weak generally) for about 5 weeks now. I've seen my GP three times, done blood test, eye test and some physical tests (balance, strength, etc) and they were all clear. The doctor said it could be the inner ear inflammation that should go away in 4-6 weeks time. After 2 weeks into this, I started looking up symptoms online (which I shouldn't have) and got scared I might have brain tumour. Since them whenever I feel something new, I'm trying to relate that to me having the brain tumour. And since 3-4 days ago, I started having mild pressure in my head and neck, as well as slight headaches (back/both sides, not in one particular place) which worries me even more. And this evening, I started feeling numbness in my hands and legs, and I'm going crazy now. If I think about more, I feel like it's getting worse.
I have to add that I have problems sleeping at night (average only about 6hrs most nights) and very bad health anxiety, that I always try to look up symptoms and diagnose myself.
So I just want people's opinions on whether if these symptoms are signs of me being too anxious or could be something serious. I'm also thinking about going back to the GP in a couple of days if I don't feel like getting better.
Any comment would be really appreciated!

"I have GAD, panic attacks, and constant insomnia. Thirty years of trying to manage it through exercise, diet, career changes, a move to a remote location....its still a horrible sleep deprived nightmarish existence. I had a decade of actual peace as my husband agreed to leave his career, I left mine and we moved to the country. I went back to University, and acquired a degree. Opened an agency because I was functioning so well. I have some great therapists as well.
I have enough money to live comfotably while I built a practice. Life happened and my marriage ended, my parents died....I kept plugging along without pharmacuticals. Little by little my anxiety returned, I rarely got more than a few hours of sleep and my savings dwindled. I found alprazalam from a doctor and a very low dose helped me sleep although most days were miserable. My career started to sink and my savings disappeared. I fell and broke my back. Worse and worse. My prescribing physician worked with me to deal with my chronic pain issues and full blown panic attacks. He tried a long series of antidepressants, sleep medications and last winter, mirtazapine. Within weeks, I was sleeping through the night(!), I could focus and started to become more calm. He raised my dose from 15mg to 30mg. The change was amazing. If it weren't for my pain, I would be able to function professionally again.
Sadly, along with mirtazapine, I gained twenty pounds. In about 5 weeks. I am less than 5'2"". I weighed almost 160 pounds. My glucose levels rose. My cholesteral levels rose. I have been careful about my weight all of my life because my family has diabetes on both sides. I lost a grandmother and an uncle to it.
I stopped the mirtazapine and I can't sleep, I wake up in a panicked sweat and I am slipping back into general constant anxiety. I lost 8 lbs in the first 8 days off the drug.
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO! I am losing my ability to work again and my husband has lupus.
HELP. I feel dark and hopeless. Currently on 150mg of wellbutron.......ugh.
Can anyone help? I can't find a current discussion groups.

It's strange, I've taken mirtazapine before, and it's worked instantly to get rid of my depression, anxiety and nausea. It was very sedating too. 
But this time round it just doesn't seem to have the same effect.

"Hello fellow anxiety sufferers
I started taking Mirtazapine 2 years ago for servere anxiety..
During this time I have done every single piece of work to treat my anxiety that google can find for me..
3 months ago I felt I was in a good space to start to come off my medication..
With the guidance of my therapist we worked out a slow taper down plan..which was successful..
I was told that after I come off completely it would take around 3 weeks for most of the effects to subside..
Apart from an increase in general anxiety..and some increased sleep issues..I was pretty much doing ok on a whole..
It has now been 3 weeks to the day and this is what I am feeling:
Paranoid
Highly anxious
4 hours per night sleep
Highly emotional
OCD ing (checking phone constantly
Suspicious
Fears
Tingling in my lips
Jittery
Now I should point out that these were all of the things that lead me to start taking the medication in the first place..
So on top of the above symptoms I am also feeling;
Depressed that all the work I have done hasn't assisted me at all
Is this the new normal for me?
What I would really like..is for someone who has made it past this point..to let me know if..
Is this only temporary?
Will this improve?
Is it normal to feel worse before you feel better?
and how long could this take?
Please help!

I stopped taking it since it was not working for me and no medications have, but i had an appointment with my Psychiatrist and said my body is having withdrawal symptoms and his response was that Mirtazapine has no withdrawal symptoms at all that has been documented. For me i am lost for words as either i am going crazy, they are saying this thinking the placebo effect will prevent what symptoms are showing or just flat out lying to me.
No new medications to try and no support given from them so what should i do now since i can not trust them.

It worked really well for 2 weeks then the anxiety came back and it wasn't until nearly 3 months after first taking that it finally went. However, about a month ago it returned and my GP put me on 30mgs and reduced my Citalopram to 35mgs initially with the aim of cutting down to 30mgs after a few weeks. Now the new dosages of my meds have made me feel awful, I still feel anxious and additionally feel depressed, I can't think straight and can't get out of bed in the morning. I feel really weird, it doesn't feel normal. I hate this feeling. I usually feel better as the day goes on but I dread waking with the awful feeling every morning. I have a GP's appointment tomorrow. Wondering if anyone can advise?

"Hey guys,
I have a question about mirtazapine withdrawel.
My story short. 8 months ago i got a severe concussion which ended up in post concussion syndrome. Basicly a concussion thats heals very slowly over the course of months (and sometimes years).
Because i got loud tinnitus from the concussion i couldnt sleep anymore. And i was very fatigued during the day. So i started taking mirtazapine 7.5mg for sleep.
While i was on mirt i slept ok (still broken but not so bad). And combined with phsysiotherapy i started to recover. A good 7 months after the concussion. I was pretty much healed. I still have tinnitus and mild fatigue issues. But i could resume normal life again and so my doctor and i decided to quit mirtazapine. The doc did not wanted to give me another presciption and told me i could quit mirt cold turkey. I knew this wasnt right. So i halved my remaining pills to 3.75mg for another 3 weeks untill i had no more. Personally i wish i could do an even slower taper. But still it wasnt to bad.
I had no problems during the taper. And after i quit i felt fine for 4 days. Then the witdrawel started to kick in.
Ive quit mirt for 7 weeks now and i feel its only getting worse. Im pretty fatigued, have weakness, foggy thinking, confusion (like misplacing things, being forgetfull), weird vision problems, nauseated, hart palpitations, numbness and tingeling in my limbs, headaches/pain, tremors, etc.. basicly lots of problems since i quit.
The thing that scares me the most is that i have had these symptoma during my concussion for months. So i at first i was over the moon i was healed from that. But now it feels like im going through it all over again. Which scares the hell out of me.
Well i guess i needed some reasurance with this post. Someone who could tell me that this is the withdrawel acting up and that it just needs time. That its normal to take this long. I would be gratefull if someone could give me answers. I dont have a bad doctor, but i think he doesnt know much about mirt withdrawel tbh.
Anyways thanks for reading my long post. And would apreciate if someone could help.

"Hi guys and gals,
I'm happy that I found this website.. Makes me feel like I'm not totally alone in this :-)
I was on Mirtazapine 7.5mg for anxiety and insomnia for more or less 1,5 years. Tried to go off a few times, but it never worked out.
This time I did a slower taper...
From 7.5mg to 3.75 for 6 weeks - no trouble
From 3.75 to 1.8something (hard to make smaller pills than 3.75) for 6 weeks - not much trouble although I was a little fatigued.
And then from 1.8mg to ~0.9 for a few weeks until I said to hell with it because they were tough to split to this size.
So 6 weeks ago or something I took my last dose. It went alright the first weeks I think, I don't remember complaining about it during that time.
Right now though I'm facing broken sleep, VERY fatigued, and some anxiety, and I guess being fatigued makes me depressed.
Is this still withdrawal or is it something else cooking?
Any anecdotes?

"I have been on Mirtazipine for about 1-1/2 to 2 years now and noticed that my periods have begun to get further and further apart. First it was once a month, to once 2 months, and for a while it was one every 4 months, and now I am on month 7 of having no period since September of last year. I am wondering if this is bad for my health and if I should get off of Mirtazipine. It has not helped my anxiety, and it has also added strange sexual dreams and vivid ones where I would think it actually happened, only to later realized it did not. And I have noticed that being on this medication I have had more nightmares than combined in my entire life. I am currently on 15 MG every other day , I tried tapering off of it, but it made me feel weird and not okay so I went backto 15 MG every other day. Should I taper off of it more slowly? Maybe 7.5 MG every other day, then stop completely?

"I would like to share my experience with 45 mg mirtazapine. my initial dosage was 15 mg, followed by 30 mg for a month then followed by 45 mg. I have been taking 45 mg for a month. I was prescribe for my depression due to insomnia. 
I am taking it to help me withdrawing from diazepam and cope with my depression. 
I was too skinny but I like the bones showed on my body. I was 168 cm, 49 kg. After 2 months of mirtazapine I am 56 kg. To be honest, I hate the fact that I worked so hard and still gaining weight. I changed my diet because I don't want to be fat.
I am going gluten free, no crips, no process, watch my fruits intake, eat hot chilli, no alcohol, eat whole foods and I increase my yoga routine to 55 mins everyday. AND I STILL GAIN WEIGHT. but I guess not as much as other people .
I dunno how long I am going to take this medicine. At this moment I cannot live without it. 
My suggestion is if this medicine helps, please take it. But you HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU EAT AND EXERCISE. Otherwise, you will be depress because of the weight gain.
If you are overweight before taking the medicine, you might want to think twice before taking this medicine.
If you are happy with ur weight, you might need to work extra hard to maintain your weight.
If you are underweight, you are lucky, this is perfect for you.  
 Good luck!

"Hi I have been on 45mg Mirtazapine for four years and am reducing the dosage to come off it.
The initial severe insomnia stopped after a few days, but I'm waking up three times in the night to eat as I'm ravenous and feel sick if I ignore it.
Everything I've read indicates people eat more on the drug, not off it.
Had anyone else had this, and does it pass?
Thank you.

"Most of you will have been told there are NO withdrawal side effects when stopping mirtazapine.  Most of you will have been told antidepressants are NOT addictive.  
The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have a system to monitor the effects and safety of medicines and their side effects.  This system is called the Yellow Card.  They receive thousands of reports submitted by the general public every year.  
I have submitted a yellow card report detailing the very nasty withdrawal side effects mirtazapine has left me with.  The more of us that report this drug, the more likely  drugs such as these will investigated more seriously.  
This is an easy process.  
The Yellow Card website is www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard

"Hi All,
I just hope this helps in some way. After consultation with my GP, 7 days ago, I decided to fast taper from Mirtazapine 30mg, After careful consideration, I had become convinced that the Mirt was having a major sedative effect.
Bear in mind I do take 60mg Cymbalta and over the last 2 years I've had 2 years CBT, turned my social well being around, achieved a tertiary qualification and changed my career to something I actually enjoy, eliminated bad relationships, I exercise and have built good structure into my life. In short, I've done a lot of hard work to ensure that there no reasons left (other than the possibility of a chemical imbalance)  to continue with AD's.
7 days ago I cut my Mirt down to 15mg, the physical withdrawals were challenging but nothing compared to the living death of previous depression. I had the sweats and quite severe shivers on the second day, I also felt extremely weak and had a mild headache. On the third day I had bounced back so I went to 7.5mg. I had the same withdrawal symptoms but much less severe, easily tolerated. From the 6th day I didn't take any Mirt at all. Had very, very mild withdrawals from there.
So, what were the positives? Well, I have to say I have more energy AND my state of mind has improved. I feel more positive and the fog has parted. I have had no negative impact on my mental health.
I now plan to monitor myself over the next two months, after which I will tackle the Cymbalta. I'm going to make a slow taper plan for this drug, expecting brain zaps (as I've had with SSRI's)  as an absolute minimum but hoping for a similar experience to Mirt as a maximum.
I just wanted to share what I think is a positive experience withdrawing from Mirt, of course in NO way would I encourage anyone to taper fast like I did. My GP and I made a thorough evaluation of all my individual circumstances and worked out a plan a and b before I started just in case something went horribly pear shaped.
Best of luck to everyone who tries to withdraw, I know some of you will have a much tougher time of it, I guess I'm lucky or just highly tolerant of physical withdrawals.

"So I visited my GP on Monday and discussed how Mirtazapine wasn't working well for me as it did a few weeks ago.
I was on Mirtazapine for two years, then an anxiety relapse in November 2017 caused the antidepressant to stop working for me. So I looked for an alternative.
I've tried a number of different antidepressants over the past few months: Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Escitalopram. Along with anti nausea medication to help with my anxiety nausea and poor appetite.
None of them worked well for me, I had horrible nausea and vomiting along with increased anxiety. So I asked to be put back on Mirtzapine at the end of January. 
And it worked so well! I didn't have nausea, I could eat tons of food. But then I had a personal incident that caused me to become depressed and anxious. I went back to my GP and they upped my dosage from 15mg to 30mg. Which only made my anxiety worse and caused more nausea and vomiting.
Eventually I was reduced to 15mg again, but I still had nausea and vomiting. I was prescribed Metoclopromide, but that only made me restless and agitated. So I went back to my GP on Monday. She offered me two options: Either I try a new antidepressant, or I try a different anti nausea medication.
I chose a different antidepressant, I was given 37.5mg of Venlafaxine. Which only reduced my appetite and made me more nauseated and anxious.
After three days I went back to the Doctors, my GP told me they were running out of options on what to prescribe me, and wondered it it was more to do with my anxiety. Which worried me a lot, my GP suggested going back on Mirtazapine due to it's effectiveness a few weeks ago. I agreed and started taking it last night.
So far I haven't noticed much improvement, I felt slightly drowsy last night. But my appetite hasn't returned.
I just hope this works soon.

"hello! i'm very new to this forum, and my gp just prescribed me to mirtazapine.
a little background: i have bipolar 2, and i have had it for quite a while. i used to be prescribed with asenapine (saphris) alongside lorazepam (merlopam) to help with my sleeping problems as well. but that was until i moved to australia seven months ago, and ever since then i never took any medication because i have just contacted another gp only a couple of days ago. so far this has been my longest episode since after i moved i didnt get it treated or anything. i was pretty much alright with the asenapine and lorazepam, but my gp prescribed me to mirtazapine 15mg just to buy time before i start my first psychiatrist appointment in australia. 
i've read some posts saying that it increases your appetite a lot, and that it gets you a bit dissociative upon first use. is there anything you think i would wanna know before i start taking it? thank you so much guys ??

"Hi new to the forum, have been trying my utmost to rid myself of this drug.
Have managed to go from 45mg. Now down to 15mg one day then 7.5 mg the next.  Feeling buzzy headed anxious and feeling sick.
Any thoughts on how long I should go with this routine, given up with my Dr. Would rather hear from the patients at the coal face experiencing this hideousness.
Do you ask for drops when you reduce again, or is cutting the 15mg. In half and then half again the route, all seems a bit hit and miss.
Would certainly value opinions.
stuck indoors in deepest Wales, hope you all are doing your best in this tricky weather.

"As I was sitting on my chair, crying in despair because I can't see the end of it...a thought occurred to me.
I cannot do anything to speed up time. But what I CAN do is make a list of things I discovered could help me...and could help you too.
Let me list down what I discovered.
[ FOR ANXIETY ]
- Magnesium oil (acts faster than Magnesium pills)
- Acupressure on the wrist (according to Traditional Chinese Medicine it's linked to the Heart) and 4 inches above the wrist. Should help a little bit with sleep.
- Potassium (should help with muscle relaxation and muscle twitches)
- Elevating legs for 10-15 minutes or until symptoms subside. I don't know why but this one always works for me. 
- L-Theanine (increases GABA and Dopamine) I use chewabale ones. They are non-adictive and use them as needed. 
- Taurine - an amino acid which increases GABA. Completely natural. I'm not aware of any side effects. 
- Binaural Beats (on Youtube) - they use different frequencies to stimulate the brain. These were and still are my salvation. Listen to binaural beats which: increase endorphins, calm anxiety, increase dopamine/gaba/serotonin....you can literally find Binaural Beats for ANY ailment these days! 
- Essential oils - Lavender, Frankinscense, place on wrists. 
- Meditation - just 3 minutes a day. Increase over time. All you have to do is sit comfortably in a quiet place and concentrate on your breathing. An app called Headpsace (free of charge) should help you get started. It's awesome for beginners. 
- Omega 3 - studies have showed that omega 3 helps with depression and anxiety. Whenever I feel really bad I pop a pill of cod liver oil and it helps. 
- Vagus Nerve stimulation - it turns out that this nerve is responsible for depression, anxiety, palpitations. (see below for details) 
- Incense under wrists - my Acupuncturist taught me this. Be careful not to burn yourself. This should increase Qi/Chi in the body and relax you. I use this one A LOT. Incense I use - lavender, frankinscense, myrrh, sandalwood. (The Chinese use Moxa. If you can get your hands on it, try it) 
- Warm milk - if you can't stand milk, buy Milk Peptide pills. Some people find them sedative. I use 2 when anxiety strikes, and 2 every night before bed. 
- EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) also called Tapping - you tap with your hand on some areas of your body while doing some positive self-talk. There are a lot of tutorials on Youtube.
- Chamomille tea or Chamomille essential oil drops under tongue
- Bach Remedy Sleep spray. This didn't help my sleep, but helped my anxiety. 
- Safe sun exposure - it increases serotonin and resets circadian rhythm
- Warmth on stomach - as lame as it sounds, it's incredibly soothing. Just use a hot waterbottle or a warm towel. 
- Dark Chocolate - it increases dopamine and endorphins. Be careful if you have adrenal problems, it could be a tiny bit too stimulating. I use it only occasionally. 
- Deep belly breathing
[ FOR NAUSEA ]
- Smelling Peppermint oil
- Gently rubbing stomach
- Ginger Tea 
- Binaural Beats
[ FOR FATIGUE ]
- Incense under wrist (see above for details) 
[ PALPITATIONS ]
- Vagus Nerve stimulation - coughing, gargling, chanting, popping ears (gently) while blowing through nose, massaging side of neck
Note: I will continue to add on to this list. 
Do you know of things which might help? Please do share them. We have to stand and fight together. We are divided by geography and circmustances, but we are connected by our suffering and our hearts' will to fight.
Let's fight together.

After taking only 4 or 5 doses of 15 mgs of Mirtazapine I can't believe how much better I felt and still do and am about to start 2nd pack.   True to the side effects, I have increased appetite and weight gain, but that suites me because I am underweight.  I can't get though food and eat all day.  The only downside is constipation, but it is worth just to feel so good again.

"Hi, iv been on 45 mg of mirtazapine for 5 years now for depression, iv gained over two stone, this past 6 months iv become very lazy and not in great form, I went cold turkey two weeks ago, think iv slept 2 to 3 hours a night, slight anxiety but I can deal with that. Had my bloods done last week to have my underactive thyroid checked that iv had for 8 years, my test came back that I now have hyperthyroidism and need to start new meds on Monday, all the symptoms are exactly the same as withdrawal symptoms from mirt apart from I am loosing weight now instead of gaining it, apparently mirtazapine masks a lot of problems especially thyroid problems so I’d advise you all to have yours checked, hope this helps

"So I'm on my 5th week of Mirtazapine now, 
I started taking it back at the start of February on 15mg, I felt great on it. But something personal happened, and I ended up getting incredibly depressed and anxious. So after two weeks my doctors upped my dosage to 30mg, which was a mistake as I started to feel more nauseated, anxious and depressed with obsessive thoughts. My dosage was reduced back to 15mg after a week. And I've been back on 15mg for nearly three weeks now. 
In that time I still had nausea issues, and I visited my doctor again who prescribed me 10mg of metoclopramide. I've been taking it for a few days now.
But the past two days I've been feeling really drowsy during the day. I've ended up napping for nearly two hours because of it. I can't tell if it's the Mirtazapine or the metoclopramide. I always take my mirtazapine at 10pm each night, and I get roughly 7-8 hours of sleep (it doesn't make me drowsy at night).
I'm kind of confused, and concerned about the drowsiness. I hope it goes away soon.

"Hi there,
I'm still having some issues with Mirtazapine, I started on 15mg about 3 weeks ago. Two weeks in to taking 15mg I started to become more depressed and anxious, with an increase in nausea. So my GP upped my dosage to 30mg.
Another week passed, and the 30mg made me feel worse, I started to obsess over things, I kept panicking and feeling sick. I had become more depressed and anxious.
I went to my Doctor on Thursday, who said that I was increased to 30mg too quickly. And I was likely having a bad reaction. He reduced my dose back to 15mg, and gave me domperidone for the nausea.
While I feel slightly better, I still keep having obsessive thoughts and panicky moments. The Domperidone doesn't seem to do much for my nausea either. And I keep getting strange symptoms:
Hot/burning sensation on my face
Small moments of shaking
Nausea/vomiting
States of panic and worry
Low mood
Moments of increased emotions (usually teary)
Headaches
moments of appetite/ then no appetite at all
I keep telling myself that they are most likely side effects and they will go away. I've just never had this sort of problem with Mirtazapine before. I took it for about over a year back in 2016, but it failed on me back in November. Since December I've been trying a few other antidepressants that didn't work well for me. So I went back onto Mirtazapine.

"I would like to share my withdrawal experiences in a bid to encourage all of those having a hard time coming off this drug.
I was prescribed mirtazapine for sleep issues in April last year. I was assured by my Doctor that they are 'totally non addictive' and that I 'could come off them at anytime' This was appealing to me as I was desperate for a solid 8 hours sleep (I had been sleeping around 3-4 hours a night for 2 months)
Please note, insomnia was the only reason for taking these tablets. I didn't feel depressed, just desperate and anxious for sleep.
My sleep improved dramatically from the first tablet I was sleeping for at least 9 -10 hours each night. At times I'd feel a little groggy but most of the time I felt refreshed and I was so relieved to be sleeping well again.
About 4 months later, my sleep pattern started to become very erratic. I'd sleep for 10 hours one night and then I wouldn't be able to sleep at all the following night. I contacted my Doctor and she advised me to double the dose. I didn't double but I did increase it from 15 mg to 22.5mg This seemed to do the trick. Apart from the occasional bad night I was sleeping well again.
My sleep continued to improve for at least 3 months, until my sleep became erratic again. The mirtazapine had obviously pooped out and I had become too tolerent for this dose. Of course my Doctor advised increasing the dose again, but I had wised up this time. I wasn't going to set myself up for another fall, I couldn't keep increasing the dose for the same thing to happen again.
I decided to taper off the medication. I had no idea of the misery and suffering that lay ahead. I would go up to 3 consecutive days without any sleep at all. Not even the dozing type! Instead I would have heart palpitations and repetetive songs playing in my head throughout the night. (I later realised this is a common withdrawal symptom) I had it really bad.
I felt completely depersonalized. I didn't have any interest in anything and I could barely muster up the energy to leave the house. I have my own business and this really suffered. I was a wreck, a complete zombie. I'm ashamed to say that there were times that I felt suicidal. What had this drug done to me?
I was able to seek comfort from other peoples experiences on this site. I also contacted the charity CITA, I spoke about my troubles and the state that I was in. It was a relief to do this, as I tend to keep things to myself so nobody around me would've known the extent of the problem. They helped devise a plan to gradually come off the medication altogether. It was reassuring to know that my symptoms were very common and that the situation would improve. They weren't able to give me a timeframe as recovery varies for different people.
I had spent 5 months on a slow taper from November - April. I cut the tablets up into smaller pieces and remained on 2 mg for a month. I then continued to miss one 2mg tablet over 7 weeks. So I'd take 7 one week, then 6 in a week, then 5 etc.
I have been off the tablets completely for over 6 weeks. I'm not out of the woods yet but I feel so much better. I sleep  between 6.5 - 7 hours each night. I have been taking 100 mg of 5htp capsules an hour before bed.I  could only take these after I had quit mirtazapine completely in order to avoid the risk of seretonin syndrome.
My advice to anyone suffering from withdrawals is know that the symptoms will pass eventually. stay strong and do the best you can to get on with life. Try not to dwell on the withdrawals and know that each day you're getting furher away from mirtazapine. There will be set backs, that's part of the withdrawals. Just accept it and keep moving forward.
Good luck to everyone trying to come off this drug. You wil get there!

"So It's been 30 days since I started Mirtazapine,
I started on 15mg, and I felt great. I felt like my old self again. But a few days later a situation occurred that made me depressed and anxious. 
My low mood started to effect me more and more, mainly on my appetite and stomach.
By day 18 I decided to go back to my GP, it wasn't my normal GP though. But they upped my dosage to 30mg.
The higher dosage only made matters worse, I became more nauseated. With obsessive thinking and increased anxiety and depression. 
So by day 25 I went back to my GP, they told me my dosage had been upped too quickly, and they put me back onto 15mg.
It's been 5 days since then and I still feel pretty nauseated and anxious. I started to get more and more concerning symptoms: a burning/hot flush sensation in my face, throwing up acidy bile, shaking and trembling. And a lump in my throat sensation.
I went back to my GP yesterday. He prescribed me 50mg of Cyclizine and told me to carry on taking Mirtazapine for a week, he signed me off work for this week and said if there weren't any improvements in this week to come back to be reassessed.
My appetite still feels low, and the nausea is still there. The shaking seems to have gotten worse as well. And I did end up vomiting this morning.
I just hope something works out this week.

"I started Mirtazipine in sept 2017 and went off it on the 1st Feb,
From September 2017 to Feb 2018 I had put on 7 to 8kg I went from 62.3 to 69.8 despite eating healthy and cutting out junk I was craving food and even eating things like chicken potatoes pasta and rice all with veggies I put on weight a lot faster then when I wasn’t on mirtazipine I ate small portions of my meals but was always hungry I’d crave food at 9 and 10pm at night sometimes 11pm and was munching on crackers and cheese, I decided to start excersising hard but found myself feeling out of energy and feeling really heavy of a morning so even though it made me sleep really well and made me feel good to do my daily programs I wasn’t happy about the weight and how I was feeling so I spoke to doctor and he suggested for me to stay on it for another couple months as the only problem was the weight and I stated I wasn’t feeling good at being heavier and wanted to see if there was anything else so he has now put me on Prozac fluoxetine and since being off mirtazipine I have lost 4kg in 3 weeks, my appetite has changed where I’m not craving food late at night and I’m not overly hungry even though I’m eating my appetite has slowed down I’m still doing my walking and excersises to keep fit and I’m finding it easier to excersise as I have more energy then before so I think so far fluoxetine has been the best so far with maintaining weight I’m sleeping well and am able to do my routines and I’m not out of energy as I was before.

"Hi all,
I have been on mirtazepine (15mg for 3 months, 30mg for 1) and can’t take it anymore. I was extremely underweight when I started taking it and it helped me get to a normal weight, but i suffer from EDNOS and I’m now 9st (im 5’4) and its making me really anxious. I have had a lot of issues with suicidal ideation on this drug (i took 2 overdoses in December) and can’t stand it anymore. I have stopped cold turkey (I’m usually good at quitting things and dealing with side effects) but don’t know what to try next which will keep my weight stable. Also, I was diagnosed with BPD last week and they want to put me on mood stabilisers but I have read that they make you gain weight too. I’m feeling so anxious and lost and hopeless at the whole situation. I saw a dietician on Tuesday and she said not to put on more weight which has made me obsess over food again. I feel awful so any advice would be great. 
Thanks

"Hi, just wondered if anyone can give me some advice please I had been taking amitryptyline and fluoxetine for over 10 yrs for fibro myalgia, I was coping fairly well. In April 2017 I got told by gp I could not take that combination anymore and I was taken off it. Gabapentin was taken instead. After a few weeks I started not being able to sleep and was prescribed mirtazapine. This was a big mistake but I didn't realise at the time as I was so desperate to sleep. I started to wake up with nausea and anxiety. I didnt realise it was the mirtazapine at first so i eventually went to see my gp who thought maybe I needed to increase the dose so I went from 15 mg to 30mg. The feelings got worse and worse so I returned to my gp and was told for a week take it alternate nights then start fluoxetine again. I did this and after 5 days of taking fluoxetine I was in a terrible state, couldn't sleep, felt sick generally very unwell. I returned to a different gp who said I had come off mirtazapine too quickly so told me to take 15 g every other night for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks I was starting to feel better so he gave escitalopram to start straight away. Again after only a couple of nights of this I started to feel unwell but I continued thinking it was just side effects, after 6 nights I couldn't continue and contacted gp to see if I could stop them. Gradually each day I felt a little better but since day 5 I now feel as bad as ever. I'm waking up in night with an overall feeling of anxiety ( I never had that until I took mirtazapine ) I feel so sick when I get up and I have absolutely no appetite! I am eating but forcing it down.
My question is is this mirtazapine withdrawal? If so how long will this last? I am getting very desperate, which really is not me I am usually a positive person. I see my gp Tuesday I'm sure he is going to suggest a different anti depressant but I really don't want to take any more drugs!
Sorry about the long post but I wanted to try and give you all information I could.
Thank you in advance for your advice.

"Hello, it's now about 8 weeks that I quitted mirtazapine, I took it for one year for only an insomnia problem. Now It's going fine except for the fact that I'm experiencing a strange sleep patern: one night I slept very well with a deep sleep, in the day I feel rested but sleepy as I slept too much, and in the next night I slept bad with a light sleep. The next day as I slept not too much good I go to sleep in the evening tired and I sleep well, and so on the pattern repeat, I alternate one good sleep night and one bad. Is it still a withdrawal symptom ? Before taking this drug I never had this sleep, I had some insomnia not severe only in some nights that is the reason why I took this drug. I hope it's not due to a permanent change of the brain chemistry by this drug. Any advice please...thanks.

"So I visited my GP today about my concerns with my upped dosage of 30mg of Mirtazapine. 
I had been on 30mg for about a week and my anxiety and depression increased, my thoughts started to be more obsessive and I could not stop over thinking. Which lead to nausea and vomiting. 
My Doctor said to me today that my dosage had been upped too quickly and was likely to be causing my increase in anxiety. 
So now i'm back to 15mg, and I've been prescribed some domperidone tablets to help with the nausea.
Hopefully I start to feel better within the next few days.

"Ive had dreadful sleep for the last month.  Waking every hour or so, but able eventually to get back to sleep.  The anxiety is ramping up as a result, although it could be perimenopause (Im 53)
Took Zopiclone for two weeks, and got solid 5-6 hours each night, and straight back to waking regularly afterwards, even on days when I felt genuinely perky and happy.
Todays doctor has pushed a one month 15mg Mirtazapine prescription my way, and a few zopiclone.  But reading some of the posts here about the trouble some have withdrawing from it and the side effects are putting me off!!
On balance, is it worth starting with this drug?

"Last time I was on these two drugs I put on 2 stone!I have Fibromyalgia. I eventually weaned myself off all my drugs over an 18 month period and lost all the weight I'd gained. ( I was on Gabapentin, Omeprazole and diclofenac too at one point due to a herniated disc) Anyway I had to go back on to Traz which helps my depression but eventually stopped helping me sleep. My GP has now prescribed me 15mgs Mirtrazapine again for sleep. I am so scared of gaining the weight again so Ive only taken 3.5mgs on the last 3 nights and I've slept great but felt very tired during the day and a bit dim witted. Imagine what 15mgs would have done!
So I'm going to see if this tiny dose means I won't gain weight this time. Some of us are obviously just way too sensitive to drugs. Has anyone else done this and not gained weight??

"Recently I started Mirtazapine 15mg, I was feeling pretty normal on them and better than the previous antidepressants I was on. But last week my depression and anxiety got worse, I started to feel incredibly depressed and emotional. I visited my GP and they upped my dosage to 30mg. I started to feel better, but then I started to feel depressed and anxious, my appetite seems to have decreased slightly today as well. Along with some moments of nausea. I'm concerned now as I'm having moments of constant overthinking and a fast pulse.
I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced similar effects while on Mirtazapine, or when their dosage was increased? Are these likely to be side effects?

"Hi there,
Has anyone experienced an increase in their anxiety and depression when starting Mirtazapine? I started 15mg a few weeks ago, and I honestly felt great, my anxiety was gone, my appetite came back and I wasn't sick or feeling nauseated.
But then a difficult situation came up, and I started to feel more depressed, more obsessive thoughts and slight nausea and anxiety.
My Doctor upped the dosage to 30mg to help with the depression last Thursday, it seemed to be helping. But the depressive thoughts and sense of panic and worry became more common as well. My mood fluctuates between positive and negative.
Has anyone else had a similar experience when starting Mirtazapine? Is it possible for it to be slight side effects while the drug works it's way into my system?

"To cut a long story short, I’ve reallt struggled with anti - depressant medication and tolerance, you name it ive tried it and I think I’ve exhausted the different groups of anti depressants. I’m not chronically depressive or anxious, or I wasn’t until starting anti depressant medication, I’ve had serious life stresses over the past 3 years that have led to feeling the need to have medicated help. 
Since Xmas I have worked up to 30mg of MT, which has totally affected my appetite, the way my brain is functioning (fugginess), I could lay in bed for hours and sit just in my own world. This just isn’t me, I’ve felt trapped in my own head and mind. I’ve reduced my prescription back down to 15mg and feel heightened anxiety but my Brain feels more switched on. Please if anyone has any advice or support for the coming weeks I’d really appreciate it, I don’t feel suicidal (I’ve only had darker thoughts while on anti depressants), just some tips and support for getting my body and mind back to some kind of normality. Thanks in advance :-)

"Hi there,
Has anyone experienced an increase in their emotions when starting Mirtazapine? I started it on 15mg about 3 weeks ago, and it really helped with my anxiety and nausea. But lately I've been feeling increasingly depressed and emotional. Having moments where I just break down and cry in frustration. I do suffer from depression.
I recently upped the dose to 30mg as advised by my doctor.
Granted my depression would have something to do with a bad break up recently, but I've just felt so emotional and incredibly hopeless, and I'm wondering if it might be a side effect of the mirtazapine.
I have taken mirtazapine in the past and I did have low mood and irritable moments on them. But I was never this emotional.

"I was switched from Prozac to Mirtazapine mostly for weight issues. While most people fear the weight gain from antidepressants, I am seeking to gain weight. Before taking meds, much of my stress and anxiety came from a lack of appetite and not being able to gain and/or keep weight on. When my doctor put me on Prozac, it made me nauseous, thus making my weight problem worse. I was switched over to Mirtazapine and it was great.
I ate more, I had more of an appetite at meal times, I gained some weight, and was less stressed out.
After about 3 months on Mirtazapine, however, everything slowly started coming back. The loss of appetite. The stress. My weight gain stopped and started declining.
I wish I could have that first month of appetite and weight gain back again. Has anyone gone off Mirt and gone back on again to give an appetite and weight boost? Or am I just immune to the drug now?

She was then put on mirtazapine. 30mg and has been on them since around sep-October. She has said it helps her sleep at night which is good, however she still has low mood sometimes and says the depression can cause tiredness and she is restricted to do the things she used to. She says that one side of her head has gone weird with the depression. How long do you reckon mirtazapine will take to fully rectify her.

"Hi,
i was wondering if someone might be able to offer some advice or insight into the following.
My mum has struggled with depression for many many years and has been on and off pills for much of that time. She has taken mirtazpine for the past couple of years, initially at 15mg  but more recently 30mg and is currently taking 45mg. Personally I am very opposed to pharmaceuticals but I understand that she feels that they do support her. 
She has seen psychiatrists who have amongst other things prescribed her quetiapine (which she came off herself as she found it really unhelpful). Anyway she is basically incredibly anxious all the time, unable to sit still, concentrate, very low mood, repetitively repeating words, crying out, ruminating, chewing things (self soothing?), poor quality sleep. She is 70 years old has also lost several stone in weight i am very worried that she is having an adverse reaction to these pills and very worried about her inability to tolerate this dose given her weight loss.  Previously her depression has just made her a bit of a sad-sack and really negative but I have never seen her in a state like this and it has been going on for several months. Her GP encourages her to remain on this course of drugs. 
I would be really grateful if this rings any bells for anyone?
thanks,
CLARE

because of this, i decided to chop up my 15mg mirtazapine tablet into quarters and i took one quarter at 10pm the night before last. by 10.30pm i was almost asleep standing up and went to bed at 11pm, not waking until 12 hours later! felt out of it for rest of day and even went back to bed around tea time for an hour or so. not taken any more tablet yet and having read postings on this website, am really not sure where to go from here. had i taken a whole 15mg tablet, i could have been asleep for 2 days!!
would really welcome comments from other folk on intolerance/hypersensitivity to medication for depression. other people all seem to be on much higher doses. have other people experimented with weaning themselves onto medication as I have (i have also tried using liquid medication, so you can increase the dose very gradually). but not all antidepressants come in liquid form. any similar experiences/opinions welcome.

I know people are bashing this pill and that pill and whoever did say this that it is all drugs that’s made from scientists and  everybody reacts differently to different chemicals and our brains are all different what works for one person does not work for the other. I will be seeing my doctor soon and tell them what’s going on but it is interesting to read all the comments especially the pros and cons that I have read. Especially Effexor versus other drugs. I can relate to her many of them in the sweats the crazy dreams etc. I am in my late 40s so I don’t know if it’s age or  The time of year but I have been crying for almost a whole day and I don’t know why so I took out some extra pills about an hour ago and I am still awake.

"Hi!  I am now 5 months, one week of being totally off Mirtazapine and am still suffering from horrendous w/d symptoms:  chronic insomnia (no sleep most days and nights) for days if not weeks at a time, burning, tingling, numbness, vibrations throughout body and head, adrenaline surges, burning brain, dp./dr,, myoclonic jerks, and the list goes on.  I have had several very small windows in the past 3 weeks, but then it goes right back 2 being totally unbearable, debilitating and downright painful.  Over the past several years I also slow tapered off Gabapentin (off just over 2 years), Zoplicone (off just over 2 years), Seroquel (off 1 year) and now Remerom off 4 5 months.  Also over 25 years ago I was heavily addicted 2 all the benzodiazapines. for about 24 years. 
I am terrified that as this just seems 2 b getting worse instead of better, that I will never b recovered from this horrible illness.  I'm struggling very hard 2 get through this, however when the symptoms get this intense it's extremely hard 2 even concentrate let alone even imagine getting better.  Has anyone else suffered to the extent I have getting off this horrendous Mirtazapine and gotten better.  I would love 2 hear from you and how 2 managed 2 survive.  Please I need some hope and encouragement that I will get through this.  Thank you.

"Hi, i've been on Mirtaapine for around 2 years now (45mg), which had really helped with my Anxiety/Depression. However since around March 2009 whenever I've took Mirtazapine I feel really really itchy, and my legs really tingle, and I feel agitated in my head. I'm now finding it impossible to sleep (unlike when I first took Mirtazapine), and last night I must have had at least three hours sleep, if that!. Another thing is the Nightmares, that are now horendous, and feel real. I wake up, and I see a figure, or sometimes an animal running across the floor, then they vanish!. I sometimes even wake up with a voice shouting in my ear.
On top of all that I don't actually feel real anymoe. I now this may sound strange, but everything seems like a dream, and i'm having to pinch myself constantly to know i'm awake!. Last night I even questioned wether I was actually in a dream, and that life was a dream, and nothing was real!. I am feeling really freaked out at the moment, with all these stupid thoughts coming into my head!. I've tried coming down to 30mg of Mirtazapine, but I just got really depressed again. Can anyone suggest what I should do?>

"About one year ago I went to another country for studying, at that time I was totally new to live in another country. I felt anxious in doing everything, taking courses, talking with foreigners etc., It was like I cannot see the future of this ""boring life"". From that time I had long-term insomnia, usually as waking up too early at 5-6am and unable to go back to sleep again. After prescribed many kinds of anti-anxiaties and sleeping pills the doctor suggested me to take anti-depreesion.
I have to say it helps a lot! I took 7mg Mirtazapine in the first two weeks and increased to 15mg for three months. During this period I also learn many self-aid techniques from books like meditation and making schedule for sleeping. These do work but just the speed is quiet slow. About one month later my situation gradually became normal, still wake up once at night but can sleep again. I do enjoy the feeling of ""I can sleep for ten more minutes"" lol.
Three months later I started to decrease the dose. First 7mg again for one and a half month, then 3.5mg for another one and a half month. And on 7th this month I had my last 3.5mg pill. Everything was fine in the coming two days. But three days ago after taking a red-eye flight I start to feel stomach upset with flu-like symptoms (very tired and a little bit dizzy). I though it was just I didn't have enough rest but anyway I found myself having irritability and insomnia. I checked this site and finally realized they are withdrawal symptoms.
However, the most strange thing is my symptoms are not stable. In the first day I was really tired and had flatulence, they were better in yesterday, but not the insomnia. Today the uncomfortable feeling in stomach improved a little as well as dizziness, and I accidentally fall into sleep for an hour during lunch break. But NEW symptom is while I am going to sleep  I have a small panic in my heart, although it disappears in minutes.
So now I would like to inquire someone for help. Does someone have similar symptoms? My dose seems very small and I showed no significant disorder during two decreasing dose, why I still feel sick when completely stopping it? For now only stomach upset and insomnia (hard to sleep and wake up relatively early) are the most annoying symptoms, so what I can do to get through this period? Should I go see the doctor again and ask her to prescribe extra Mirtazapine. I found this time Zolpidem doesn't work, perhaps I should try ant-ihistamine?

"So I started on the mirtazapine 15mg around mid October and initially I only had some drowsiness in the morning as a side effect. A few weeks later I had some strange dreams/nightmares along with some hallucinations, mainly hearing things that weren't there but they both eased off. 
Around 6 weeks ago I then developed this strange sensation in my lower tummy area occasionally making me want to go pee (which I did at times) but I would wake up every night around 3-5am. So I don't know if it's connected to the Mirt or not. Then about a month ago I started developing bouts of frequent urination, like I would end up peeing maybe twice within 1-2 hours which is unusual for me to do so. I usually go around 2-3 times a day!  So anyway still having these symptoms and I figured if it is related to the mirtazapine then I should stop it. 
I went up to 30mg for a few days at one point but then went back down to 15mg. Took 15mg once a day for about the last two weeks and decided to stop it altogether 3 days ago.  So I don't know if I'm what experiencing now (the middle of night waking with mild sensation of wanting to pee) is related to the drug or not. I've had urianalysis done 4 times, all normal, tested my blood glucose level using home testing kits before/after meals and that's normal too. 
I don't know the feeling I have is this slight uncomfortable feeling in my stomach, possibly anxiety related or something else.

"I have just stopped taking mirtazapine for almost 3 days now. How long roughly does it take for your body to be rid of it?  I hear it's around 4-6 days, is that right? If that's the case then why do some people continue to have withdrawal symptoms?  
I assume perhaps it's due to the high dose. I've only been on 15mg for almost 3 months so the doctor said I could just stop it whenever if I wanted as it's a low dose. So side effects/withdrawal symptoms are less likely with a smaller dose?

Slept okay for about 5 days on 30 then really struggled with sleep. 2-3 hours at the most. I was almost like it did the opposite affect!!!! And the anxiety on a morning and afternoon, horrible thoughts, depressed, anxious. I've been to docs this morning and I'm coming back down to 15mg, I'm not staying on 30mg any longer, doc was good he could not understand though why the 30 had been so bad. Even when I was tapering citalopram 40mg to start Mirt I never felt that bad. So starting back on 15mg tonight. Also go propanolol 80mg slow release and some diazepam when needed. I not saying Mirt is horrible because 15mg when I first started in April worked great for me, and when I had a big wobble  about 3 weeks ago, I thought yeah 30mg would sort me out. No actually I made me have the worst 2 weeks of my life!!!! I have suffered anxiety on and off for 8 years and these 2 weeks have been awful. So back to 15mg for me and see how that goes can't be any worse than how I felt on 30mg.

"HI Everybody
I have been taking MIrtazapine since Middle of May 2016.
This whole thing started with some sleepless nights and two panic attacks which came after me taking xanax for like 2-3 weeks of half 0.25 MG two times per day due to some OCD thoughts and sleep. That backfired and instead of stopping and riding it out i thought it was better to go to the doctor. That was when my whole world started to fall down. The stupid doctor prescribed another benzo and antidepressant which i did not need at all because if i had a good night's sleep the next day i was really normal. The antidepressants cause your situation to worsen before improving so she tried me on Fevarine 4 days, Amitryptiline increased from 25 to 50Mg than added 6Mg of bromazepam (benzo) and at the end as i was getting stuck on Bromazepam she gave me Remeron. I was telling her since the begining that i have a obsesive fear from the meds especially benzo so the treatment will just worsen my condition but she was telling me ""trust me, i know better"". SO i trusted and i ended up almost destroying my life. And i am still not convinced whether i am out of the woods yet. Remeron really caused me to become suicidial, eventhough those feelings i can attribute the big reductions on Bromazepam she recommended at that time. I don't know how the psychiatry can be in such a low point nowadays destroying peoples lives just like that. I am very p*ssed of psychiatry nowdays so i met another doctor regarding my issues and the first thing he did checked my tongue and said you have nutrition problems and that was right because i was dieting since december and lack of nutrition most probably led me to that mental situation. I was mentioning that fact to my first doctor as well in that first meeting, and imagine the first pdoc i went in is the head of Psychiatry in the national hospital in my country and is considered as the best doctor in her field.
Anyway cutting the story short i think i am starting to recover right now but i want off the Remeron. It numbed me and i was not able to feel neither bad nor good emotions. Good emotions have been always a strong part on my side as i have a lot of friends, i have had a very active life and i am a funny person to be with but Remeron stole that all from me at only 15Mg. 
At 4th of July i did my frist cut from 15Mg to 12.8Mg. As i stoped Amitryptiline and Bromazepam in 9th of June 2016 i can attribute some of the feelings to withdrawals from those meds during all this time.
11th of August i did my second cut to 12Mg and so far it went OK. I noticed some bad sleeping pattern and a little anxiety and depression around days 4 and 5 of my cut. 
20th August was my third cut to 11Mg which i am currently now. I noticed again that todays i the 5th day and my sleep was not good and i had anxiety in the morning which is passable. It is a lot better compared to the previous months.
How i am doing the cuts it is quite easy. I am mixing 15Mg remeron tablet with 15ml water to have a distribution of 1ml = 1mg. I mix them well until no crumbs are left in the glass and take the amount needed using a syringe. If everything goes well with this method and I am able to cut 10% each 10 weeks i hope to be weaned off by maybe start of the next year.
Anyway one week ago i went and meet my second doctor and he was saying that if i want to solve this situation without medicines i can simply cut to 7.5 for one or two weeks and then drop altogether. I am scared to follow the doctor and make big cuts because in case i have a lot of effects that would mean being off from my work. I know being off from work is not the end of the world but with my conditions, two kids to take care and a loan to pay off this is the last think i am looking for right now.
From the discussions here i read a lot of horror stories regarding this medicine and from some other sites i come to know that there are people who do not have problems come off but there are some who are really affected with heavy withdrawals.
What do ya think...???? Should i take the chances and follow the doc or continue my snail's pace into a slow withdrawal...???
All the best to everybody and keep tight. We will survive.

"Hello, my partner has been having the worst time with anxiety, panic and depression for over a year now. He's been on several tablets and the latest is upping his 10mg of Escitalopram to 20mg. However his doctor has said he needs to come off his 7.5g of Mirtazapine which he takes at night to help him sleep.
Personally I think this is a bad idea, sleeping (or lack of) is one of the biggest problems he has and the Mirt really helps him.
I'm just wondering if anyone is taking 20mg of Escitalopram with Mirt?
His doctor is pretty useless and won't give him a straight answer.

"Has anyone done this? I went onto Mirtazapine after my latest bout of depression, and to help me come off temazepam and cut down on my alcohol. I had been drinking 3-4 glasses of wine a night and was on 5-10mg temazepam a night too. Mirtazapine worked wonders and I found it extremely easy to cut out the temazepam all together and to cut down alcohol to a couple of times a week. It also cured my migraines, and my itchy skin, and my morning sickness. All this with hardly any side effects except for being totally knocked out for the first week, but that passed, and I put on a stone in weight. It is the weight issue that has got me down and the reason I want to change meds. I can't take SSRIs or any of the tricyclics, mainly due to insomnia and sexual dysfunction.
So I have decided to go onto trazodone but can find nothing on the net about any other people's experiences. I have cut down to 15 mg of mirt for 10 days without problems and have now started on 75 mg of trazodone and 7.5 mg of mirt. I was going to stop the mirt when I started on the trazodone (doctors orders) but reading about withdrawal on here, I have decided to cut to 7.5 mg mirt first.
My first night on this was last night and I could not sleep for 2 hours due to my heart pounding and feeling panicky about not breathing. However, I don't know if this was real or just a panic attack as I had become really frightened of taking the trazodone in case I had a bad reaction.
Any advice?

"I understand that this question may sound stupid... obviously, mirt and alcohol and weed are not compatible as both are are well-known as depressants.
However, those are social things... Sometimes having a few drinks on the party is unavoidable. Anybody can share with such an experience? What exactly may happen, and at which amount of booze?
Thanks

"I can;t seem to get a good answer for this.  Hope you can help.  I am on 6.7mg of remeron a night for insomnia but this stuff is making me a complete zombie and dizzy, awful feeling.  I am also in Benzo W/D so I can;t taper yet.  Anyway is the 6.7 more sedating since it is a lower dose than 7.5?  Or maybe should I go back to 7.5?  I just want to be the most comfortable I can be while being stuck on this stuff fo rnow.

"Hi guys. 
Just wanted to start by saying that these forums are fantastic for making you feel like you're not alone on this journey. So thanks to everyone who has shared their story. I've been reading them for a while on here and decided to sign up. 
This is my personal story. 
I was put on Mirtazapine about two and a half years ago (at some point in early 2015) for anxiety and slight depression. I felt like I was struggling a lot in social situations, sweating a lot, and having a general feeling of panic. I saw a GP and she prescribed this to me as a 'light soother' or something along those lines. I know it's my responsibility to read things, but I was stupid and started taking it without a second thought. The GP didn't describe the side effects etc at all and I didn't ask. I guess I was desperate for some relief. 
Anyone, to not go on too much, the short story is that Mirtazapine 15mg made my anxiety and depression significantly worse. I only started getting full on panic attacks after I started taking Mirtaz and I feel into a deep depression with serious suicidal ideation after about a year of being on it. Here's the stupid thing, even after these episodes, my doctors tried other anti-depressants, and I hated them so they told me to stay on Mirtaz. And I did, and things got slightly better as more time went on, but I absolutely hated the way it made me feel. Tired, drowsy, pale, lack of energy, honestly it's been pretty horrible. 
So I this year I decided to go off it. The problem is when I go off it I get terrible IBS. So I've fluctuated on and off for about 3 months. Now I'm at the point where I am convinced I need to get off it, so I've decided to tough out the IBS - try natural remedies etc - and get off this awful drug. 
Today I woke up after taking it late last night, and I felt absolutely dreadful. Depersonalised, headaches, nightmares, tight throat, etc etc. I haven't done anything because of how s**t I feel today, so it's taking it's toll. 
I know that other people have experienced similar things, and I'm just wondering if anyone felt better after being on it for years and then stopping? And whether anyone had these intense reactions to Mirtaz?
I should also mention that I'm in a much better headspace now than when I went on the pill. Much more positive and hopeful, so I think it's a good time to get off.

"Hi...
After a year of slow tapering... I have taken the plunge and am on my 4th day of being mirtazapine free!!!!
I know it's early days and that I a am sure to experience withdrawals, however my question to those who have successfully managed to come off is,
When did you get your energy back? When did the lethargy lift?
So pleased I'm off it, but it feels like I'm still taking it if that makes sense. Waking up tired and just don't have any oomph! 
Have spoken to some lovely ladies who have given me support through tapering, but Any other experiences regarding this would much appreciated! I know everyone is different... I'm trying to be patient.... Just want my energy back! 
Thanks!

But the last few days my anxiety has come back really bad so now wondering if I should bite the bullet and increase the dose. I didn’t have any issues when starting but wondering if I will get side effects if I increase to 30mg

"I have been going through a very stressful period in my life since June 2017 which has caused  depression anxiety and a serious sleep disorder which has prevented me from getting no more than a average of 3-4 hours of sleep.In Oct, i finally decided to see a doctor get something to help me sleep i was prescribed 7.5mg of zopiclone.This helped me to fall asleep but once awoken usually after 4-6 hours i couldn't get back to sleep and due to the cost i was taking them very irregularly[2 times a week on average to try to get some decent sleep.In early dec. i went to another doctor and explained my anxiety, depression and sleep disorder he prescribed sandez-mirtzapine 30mg for my condition i am now on my 4th dose and have noted a little decrease in anxiety and have been taking them around 11pm and although i dont seem to get sleepy from them they have allowed me to fall asleep and return to sleep after waking allowing a average of 6 hrs.On Friday evening after feeling depressed i feel asleep at 8.30 and woke around 11 [I had previously got apx 6-7hrs of broken sleep [ie woke once and got back to sleep the night before after initially getting to sleep apx 12:30]I have been staying with a friend since the passing of my mother of whom i had been living with and the stress of this and losing my home has caused this condition,Anyway on Friday after waking I had 4 beers [i very seldomly drink and usually have no more than 3 beers]I felt better and wasnt as depressed after the nap and felt a reduction in my level of depression which seemed enhanced after the beers with no side effects or tiredness ,However after attempting to sleep at 4am i couldn't fall asleep and have been up since.My questions are is this a normal reaction? Should i be concerned about using this drug? can it be taken with the sleeping pills if i  continue to experience these worrisome  periods of sleeping disorders?  I am very concerned about the use of this drug and would very much appreciate any advise that could be offered by those that have experience in its use

"Hi I was swapped on to mirtazapine from amitryptyline. I had taken amitryptyline 50 mg for 20 years. It stopped working to help me sleep so doctor did straight swap on to mirtazapine. Something I had taken for 20 years was stopped in the space of 5 days. I trusted her judgement but I was very wrong. It's 4 months now since I stopped the amitryptyline and I seem to be feeling more ill as the time goes on. I know people say its out of your system but my nervous system is constantly jumping. I'm hot then real cold my heart is beating to fast more often lately and my head doesn't feel right. Right now I feel horrendous that's putting it madly.is it normal still to be feeling like this 4 months later from withdrawal or is it the mirtazapine causing me more of the problems. I've taken 15 mg now for 4 months and not once has it helped me sleep. No appetite at all and no. Interest in doing anything. Feel like I've run into a brick wall and don't know what to do for the best. Any reply would be much appreciated.

"Hi
I have been taking 20 mg Escitalopram for about 18 months. It has been very effective in helping with depression, I cannot dispute that what so ever. Since taking it though, I've a lot of dizziness and even passing out. the trouble is, we don't know if it is a side effect or something else, but lots of hospital tests on heart etc are all OK.
Anyway, I'm now (a few days ago) starting to phase down the dose of Escitalopram and have started taking Mirtazapine. I take 15 mg at night and sleep like a new born - it's amazing.
Does anyone else take this sort of combination?
In the past I tried Sertraline  (could not sleep at all) and Citalopram - no sleep at all and blinding head aches.

"I've long suffered from depression, hashimotos thyroid, and chronic migrained. The last two conditions, I've been very active in treating with an endocrinologist and neurologist, but depression has never been under control. 
For thyroid I take, 113.5mg desiccated organic thyroid (naturethroid) and have been steady for years.
For migraines, I take topamax 75mg nightly, which i realize is also a mood stabilizer. I actually tolerate it very well and have been on it for 4 months with minimal side effects - just weight loss. And additionally I take magnesium oxide 800mg and b2 300mg.
And abortive migraines I take naratriptan 2.5mg.
My migraine medicine routine cut down attacks from 12 a month to 2-4, making life livable again.
So now I finally set out to treat depression, and first found lexapro untolerable. I was drunk and slurring and unable to drive, my psych deemed that class out of the question for me. 
So now I'm on mirtazapine 7.5mg, nightly, and i'm supposed to go up to 15 in two weeks. This is my 4th day, and i'm already experiencing terrible brain zaps and clicking in my eyes and head every afternoon around 1pm. It's really scary, and kind of feels similar to the beginning of how the lexapro experience started for me. I read somewhere that triptans for migraines and seratonin meds shouldnt mix but my doctors never mentioned this concern and all know my meds.
I really really want to tackle my depression and try to have a fulfilling life. I just got a new job and have a few weeks over the holiday to test out these side effects and or deal with withdrawals. Does anyone have any advice or hope on the brain zaps? Im so scared that mirtazapine will stop me from being able to work at my new job, or contribute to migraines. But if i stop the medicine im not sure ill try another antidepressant for a long while. I'm not sure what to do.

"Hi everybody,
I'm just looking for some words of reassurance as I am exhausting all my friends. I don't think my family believes me that I'm experiencing withdrawal from mirtazipine after only being on 7.5 mg for 3 weeks but I truly am and I'm terrified. I've been off for a little over a week and I'm up all night every other night feeling like my skin is crawling and wanting to jump out of my own head. I got 2 hours of sleep last night and feel like I'm going to throw up my breakfast. It might be worse for me as this is on top of existing adrenal fatigue and severe weight loss. Someone please reassure me that this will end.

"I am a 24 year old male that recently tapered off of Mirtazapine. I was taking between 7.5mg and 15mg over a time period of about 10 months. I stabilized at 15mg for almost 6-8 of the 10 month time period. I am not a doctor and I did not do this under the supervision of any doctor. 
The main reason for tapering or “coming off” of the medication revolves around the side effect regarding weight gain. Specifically weight gain centered on the lower abdomen. I have always been very fit and in shape, although after taking Mirtazapine for the last 10 months I ballooned up around 40 pounds. Within the first four days of starting Mirtazapine I gained 17lbs in weight. 
My reduction was simple. The half life of Mirtazapine is roughly 20 hours. Therefore in a healthy adult it is usually excreted entirely in five days. Therefore I gave myself 7 days on each ‘phase’ or milligram adjustment. This offered me 2 ‘buffer’ days that helped me determine how I felt after the entire dose adjustment had been excreted. 
I reduced at 1/4th pill (started with 15mg tablets) per 7 days, so it took a total of 21 days to entirely taper off. 15 -> 11.75 -> 7.5 -> 3.75 -> off. The only withdrawal symptoms that I encountered were morning nausea, reduced appetite during the day and more difficulty to awaken in the morning. Since reducing down to 0mg I have experienced insomnia along with the other symptoms. Although not terrible enough to stop me from continuing my planned abstinence from Mirtazapine. 
Personally I experienced more energy, easier awakening, less depression, more sociability and of course, weight loss, during and after my taper and I have personally found that it has been a reasonable and overall productive experience for myself. I am glad with the limited withdrawal symptoms and my mental health and mood feel leveled out again. If this changes, I’ll likely try a new antidepressant with limited weight side effects. 
I hope this offers anyone some insight into the unknown path of reducing and eliminating medications, especially antidepressant medications with a relatively subjective and unknown reaction experienced by each individual. During my taper I didn’t encounter any increase in depression, but if you or someone else does, it might be worth considering your options and potentially slowing or halting the taper altogether.
Thanks for reading. Best of luck!

I am sure this drug is a Godsend to some...but please check it out. Most Dr.s have never taken most of these. Even more have never come off of them.

"Hi all,
I am currently on a 15 mg dose of Mirtazapine (have been for about a year and a half)and I would really like some advice regarding the process of getting off of it. Last time my psychiatrist tried to take me off of it I was at 30 mg and she decided to take me off cold turkey. WELL. Suffice it to say that it did not go well at all- I could barely do anything other than cry, puke and sleep and when I told my psych that I was having terrible withdrawal she informed me that there was no withdrawal for Remeron hahahahaha. A second of Googling later she was like ""OOPS"" and put me back on the lowered dose I'm at now. She has been talking about taking me off it again recently and I said that I wanted to think about it. Mostly I am really scared that she has no idea what she is doing with this drug and the withdrawal will be terrible again. People who have stopped at 15 mg, have you been okay? I'm on a lot of psych meds and if be happy to stop taking some of them, especially the sedative ones, but I dont want to get that messed up again. Thank you!

I was tapered off cymbalta and put on mirtazipine 15mg 6 days ago...ive felt like a zombie since the first night taking them..sleepy, irritable, spaced out and dizzy. I'm considering just taking half of one tonight and phone my therapist tomorrow and say I want off this.. .she will no doubt try to get me to persevere for another 2 or 3 weeks but I don't want to. She offered me venifexaline as a choice before she put me on this stuff. She was also talking about trying pregabilin but I'm not sure I want to go down that route. I've done cbt 3 times and even paid for hypnotherapy.. .now I am leaning towards trying ketamine or a trip on psilocybin mushrooms or lsd to try to find a root cause to my issues. I'm not reccomending any of the above drugs to anyone...do some research of your own.
Anyone else get this hangover numb effect from mirtazipine when you started? Any info would be appreciated

"Hi all, hope you are doing well. Im writing today because i am scared whats going on inside my head. I went from 30mg mirtazapine to 15mg for a week and switched straight to fluoxetine. I don't know if im getting withdrawal or weird side effects from the new meds. I wake up every morning shaking, I'm worrying a lot, I've stopped eating, been getting headaches, nausea, horrible digestion problems and the worst of them all I got some homicidal thoughts about a family member i love very much. I had a panic attack last night wondering why i would think up something like that. Then it was near enough impossible to get my mind off it because it deeply disturbed and worried me. I know im not crazy and would NEVER do anything like that because i have nothing but love towards my family, but it just really scared me. Is this a withdrawal effect? It seems crazy to me how it can make thoughts like that if so.
I'm a very sensitive person with multiple anxiety disorders so i have put it down to anxiety to try and rationalise it. Can anyone offer some advise and inform me how long this withdrawal will last? Thank you for reading.

"Hi all, I'm currently in the withdrawal stages with Mirtazapine and its just ridiculous. I can go to bed completely calm and not fall to sleep at all. I zone out a little but come round and look at the clock in half an hour. Its like i need that drug to fall asleep and if I don't have it, even if I'm perfectly calm and my thoughts aren't racing, i won't fall to sleep.
I come off mirtazapine because it wasn't helping my anxiety at all and it made me feel very tired, lacked concentration and i genuinely felt trapped in a cloud. I went down to 15mg for a week and then got put onto fluoxetine. The doctors thoughts were it would cut out the withdrawal symptoms by introducing the new drug. Honestly, i felt great when i first took it. My energy was high and i felt clear headed and focused. Also my anxiety was kept in check just after the first pill. Literally the only thing going wrong is the sleeping again (well lack of). I find it very hard to be positive when I'm mentally exhausted. Bags and watery eyed, my head feels like its being stepped on. It just doesn't feel like i can be productive in this state. I just don't want to cave in and go back on mirtazapine when i knew for a fact i was unhappy on that drug. So I'm not sure what to do, trust me, i have tried every sleep hygiene tip you could imagine. I think its deeper than that. I believe i NEED that drug to fall to sleep now seeing as i can be calm and still nothing happens. I meditate before bed and everything but it doesn't help. Any advise would be appreciated. Thank you.

"I have been on mirtazpine for nearly 3 years, solely to help with my insomnia episodes. I have only ever been on a dosage of 15mg.
I've decided to come off them now as i was increasingly groggy and couldnt get out of bed and was starting affect my work. I've been taking 7.5mg for about 4 months and 2 weeks ago I just stopped taking them.
I was fine for the first week but since then I have had chronic episodes of diarrhoea, once that stopped I feel constantly nauseous, no appetite, have lost nearly half a stone, every time I do eat, the food feels like it's sitting in my throat and my skin is really itchy.
I'm not going back on them as I can cope with the withdrawal symptoms but just wondered how long I can expect to be like this for?
I've always been a lover of food and mirtazpine made me gain nearly 2 stone so it's a bit of a novelty not wanting to eat at all but I would quite like to enjoy food again.
Any body been through similiar?

"Hi,
I stopped mirt 12 nights ago. I am undergoing extreme anxiety. My sleep is ok. I am taking melatonin and Benadryl at night to offset symptoms. Anyone else currently d/c this drug? BTW I was on 15mg for 4 months. Good for sleep but I gained 40 lbs. I started skipping doses, then tapered over the course of 2 weeks. Hopefully, I am spared the extreme withdrawl that others have posted. I am anxiously approaching the 2 week mark which seems to be another hurdle experienced by others in the withdrawl process. I will continue to post in hopes someone may be helped on this journey. Blessings.

"Hi all
I have registered in this site to get some reassurance from people who may have successfully withdrawn from Mirtazapine. I was on 15mg for 6 months and tapered over 6 weeks. Halfway through tapering I developed a cough which I thought at the time was viral. I had stopped Mirtazapine for 2 weeks completely and as I then felt the cough was related to withdrawal went back to the go who advised to reinstate at 15mg.
I am a week in ans there is no improvement to the cough which is relentless. My sleep has improved but I do have fatigue. 
Can anyone please advise on this issue and maybe give some reassurance that it will pass please? Much appreciated

"Hi all,
I've been taking Mirtazapine 7.5mg or 15mg for around 4 weeks now for sleeping problems / depression / anxiety (they all seem to inter-relate and feed each other).
For the first 3-4 days I thought they were brilliant - sending me to sleep and keeping me asleep longer.
However, in the last 3 weeks, I've generally tried to cut down to 7.5mg and although I generally get to sleep OK, I find myself dreaming constantly all night and very vividly. So vividly in fact that I'm waking up every hour after a dream feeling exhausted with my mind and body aching.
The dreams are usually quite stressful and involve me trying to do something which I'm putting all my energies into. I wake almost in physical pain, especially around the temples. I then nod off again into another dream!
The next day I usually feel very tired, drowsy and sometimes dizzy from such restless nights due to dreaming. This leaves me feeling too tired to exercise or doing anything apart from get myself together for work. My sinuses are usually pounding too.
Has anyone else had similar experiences?

"Hello,
I hope someone can help me out. I am on mirtazapine for 4 months now. First i was on 7.5mg for a month, then 15mg. Soon i could not tolerate this dose, and reduced to 13mg. Was fine at this dose for a month. Then on Early september, i started to feel severe agitation on this dose and was force de to reduce. Reduced to 7.5mg, on the third day of this dose i was severly sedated, was Iike i wanted to be awake and my brain wanted to shut me off. I dont understand why this happened , because when i was at this dose the first time for one month, i didnt even felt near as sedated as i was. Now upon reducing, after being on 13mg for almost two months, how can this happen? So i reduced to 3.75, was on 7.5mg for 3 days only, because i was almost like fainting the entire day. On 3.75, after 3 days my sleep suffered for one night, but after 5 days, i felt much sedated, but not as much like on 7.5m, i persisted on 3.75mg, after 7 days and now it seems to be more stable. Never the less, i feel extremly tired during the day, hang over like a train as passed over me. I tried even to updose to 4mg, but felt too much agitation restless legs, returned to 3.7 and it called down. So it seems i am stock on this dose. Any body got this inverse reaction? Normally i heard it would be the opposite of sedation when reducing. If so, did you notice the same reaction after a drop in dosage again? Is like my brain is inverted.
Thank you.

"Hi, I have recently had a bit of a breakdown following the end of a relationship. I initially started taking Fluoxetine but I was having trouble sleeping , literally couldn’t sleep at all for 7 days. I was lying in bed aware of my heartbeat thudding.
I stopped taking Fluoxetine for a few days and was slowly beginning to sleep but the tears came back and was an emotional mess again.
I have just started on Mirtazapine. It’s only been a few days but I am really worried about the side effects. They definitely help me sleep but I am a complete Zombie during the daytime. I am not “with it” at all. There is no way I can drive or go to work like this. The last few days have felt like a drugged blur. 
Does it take long to get used to Mirtazapine and feel normal? 
I took Fluoxetine previously for many years without any significant side effects and am thinking maybe I gave up on these too quickly or maybe a different SSRI would be better.

I ran out of tablets and went 2 days without my 15mg dose. I lost 2 lbs. I was in shock as I cycle 150 miles a week, diet and do weights but cannot shift the weight. I have to do all of this just to maintain. I was wondering if this is the withdrawal of mirtazapine or just a coincidence. Has anyone else experienced this? 
While I am here are there any alternatives to mirtazapine? The weight gain is hard to control and probably making me more down. Insomnia is the biggest problem for me.

"It is advisable to taper no more than 10% per month, or 5% every 2 weeks. Or listen to your body - if WD symptoms are present wait a little longer. This slower method is possible by making a liquid solution. Tapering to less than 1 mg may be necessary to enable a secure landing, 0.9 mg to 0.1 preferably for the sensitive.  Or even 0.1 mg every other day for a few weeks:
MAKING MIRTAZAPINE LIQUID, PILL & 'SOL TAB' INSTRUCTION
Here is the pill to liquid instruction for anyone who might want to taper slowly.
You will need a 15 ml syringe and also a 1ml syringe with markings on at 0.1ml intervals
A pill crusher (available from Amazon)
Ora Plus suspension (available from Amazon)
A clean medicine bottle or small jar
A small accurate measuring jug or medicine cup with measure on. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Crush up 2 x 15mg (or 1 x 30mg) Mirtazapine pills until they are a fine powder (although the outer coating does not grind up as fine as the white Mirt’ powder that is inside, but that's fine. So long as the white Mirt’ is a fine powder.
• Then measure both 15 ml water & 15 ml Ora Plus and pour into the medicine bottle or see the end for receptacle..
• Then pour the powder INTO THE WATER FRIST, and shake it , then add the OraPlus & shake vigorously. So 1ml of the liquid equals 1mg of Mirtazapine. N.B. Mirtazapine is not soluble in water and so you must shake it vigorously every time you take out a dose to ensure you are getting an accurate measure of Mirtazapine.
• Also you should store it in the fridge. It is recommended to keep it no longer than four days.
So from the 30 mg / 30 ml draw up the syringe what you require. 
1 ml of the liquid = 1 mg.  So if you want 25 mg draw up 25 ml etc.
This has been tried and tested and works very well. Just make sure you shake it very well before drawing up the syringe.
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
Using SOL TABS, similar to the above:
Sol Tabs can be very useful if you are withdrawing, or maybe even if you are changing doses.
+++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++
VERY USEFULL ADVICE FROM advice from “B”
I use the OraPlus and yes, it tastes yuck! Important is to suspend the tablet in a bit of water first. I do 50% water, mix and then add the OraPlus, and it still keeps it well suspended so able to stretch the $. If you add the tablet to just Ora Plus, I have found it makes a white glob, hard to mix! You could maybe try Karo Syrup which is thicker than maple syrup. I use these tubes to mix in because they have the hash marks on the tube and you don't lose volume trying to transfer from measuring to your container: 
The markings do wear off after many uses so good to have the supply!
I'll add that for those who want to use just water, even the SolTabs will settle quickly, so I do think it is necessary to use something to keep it in suspension. The other benefit of the Ora Plus is that I believe it has stabilizers in it which would help preserve the integrity of the drug.

"Hello,
I have been depressed for the past 5 1/2 months now. My psych prescribed minitran ( a drug sold in greece that contains Amitriptyline hydrochloride and Perphenazine) at first and then a month later added fluvoxamine maleate.

I also still take 200mg fluvoxamine maleate for obsessive thoughts. I know it is still early days but i guess I am looking for some reassurance. Mirt has helped me with sleep but my mood hasnt lifted a bit and in the past 3 days it has been quite bad. I feel very low, no motivation, like life has no meaning if I am like that, my thoughts are all over the place,etc. Is that normal? Did anyone have similar reactions?

"HI
I have been of Mirtazapine now for 16 days, I know it sound silly to count the days but that what its down to.  I went off the med because I started having bad swelling in my ankles, feet and legs and then extreme pain in my legs and thighs.  I was on 3.75mgs for about 10 weeks and then to 1.88mgs for 2 weeks, then I stopped it because my psychiatrist said it was okay and would be no problem.  I felt awful within about 6 days, body aches (flu like) headaches, anxiety, nausea, so I called his office and his nurse saId he said to go back on, to shave small pieces off the pill and take, well I couldn't believe it, did he not remember why I stopped the med, he also said don't take the xanax, I am guessing because he wanted me to take these unmeasured shaved pieces.  Well I didn't talk to him but I thought I'm not going back on this crap.  In the past 2 weeks I've had what I am guessing are withdraw symptoms, headaches, body aches, nausea, dizziness (I don't need the dizziness because I already have a vertigo disorder),  heightened anxiety,  1 panic attack, I guess it was a panic attack, these are the smptoms I had when it happened, sudden feeling of dread in my chest and stomach, bad nausea, couldnt breath right, extreme fear, I could move I was paralyzed with fear, when I did finally get moving I was driving and was scared to death, couldn't breath again, chocking nausea feeling, crying, dizzy, scared to death that what was happening was a heart attack, does this sound like a panic attack?  
Anyway I'm curious if any of you have these same symptoms?  I also want to know have you noticed a day where you will feel ok then the next you feel awful, it all comes back.  Do you feel nervous alot, like adrenaline running all the time?  Do you feel scared a lot because of coming off the med, waiting for something bad to happe?  
I started this med for anxiety, which I've had on and off for many years, but when the vertigo disorder came into my like, the anxiety was off the charts to the point of not being able to function.  Now I feel as if some damage has been done to my nervous system because of the constant stress and anxiety.  
I believe this medication can be good for some people, and luckly they have no effects from it, but it seems more that most have awful effects and some are lasting.  My question is, do you think the body can heal from this med after stopping it?  Do you feel we can be ok and our anxiety can get better?  For those of you who have stopped it in the last few months and gone through the withdrawl, having any of these symptoms I mentioned, did they stop after awhile?  Did you have days where you thought you just wanted to die, then it slowly got better?  
This med was great at the beginning, it stopped my anxiety and obsessive thoughts the first day, but then getting off of it has been hard.  I don't know if its from reading  how some people have had to go on and off of it for years to get off of it.  I guess the longer you take it the worse it is, I don't know.  Sometimes I wonder if people are just trying to scare others to death, I know meds can be hard to come off of, but I just can't understand how it can take years and how some people say they have withdrawl for years.  
I hope someone can help me out.  I just can't bring myself to go back on this med, Im trying to push through each day and hope it gets better soon.  Thank you

"I started Mirtazapine 30 mg 4 nights ago. Doc replaced Trazodone 50 mg with Mirtazapine and added Vyvanse as well. Reason was increased insomnia, anxiety, depression & extreme night terrors due to a new major stress issue with my son.
Day 1: Woke up with ""Hangover"" & pounding headache. Up 5 times for bathroom trips. However, I had less anxiety that day.
Day 2-3: Great sleep & night terrors have subdued to same vivid dreams, but less terror. Still less anxiety through the day & less daily nausea.
Day 4: Great sleep, feel alive & ready to tackle the day. However, my clothes are snug around the breasts/back. I stepped on the scale, thought I gained 10 lbs, yet have lost 2 lbs!
Okay, any advice would be so appreciated. Pros- sleeping better, still vivid dreams, but not terror, feeling less anxious & seeing life with a better perspective.

I called my psych doc yesterday because I was so sick this weekend and anxiety was so high on monday.  When I saw him last week he said lets stay off the meds and try therapy, then yesterday he said go back to the 1.88mg dose and he will call me thursday.  I originally stopped this med because I was swelling and having legs aching all the time.  Now he wants me to go back on it, after telling me 2 days before to stay off of it and do therapy.  I honestly don't know what to do, the anxiety and stress in my system is worrying me, I have health anxiety so this is making me think its causing heart issues.  I'm 55yrs old so I worry about how all this long term stuff is now effecting me.  Is it normal for the muscles to feel tight for days and the anxiety to be there all the time?  Have any of you stopped this med only to be told to go back on?  Did it help when you went back on?  Did you get off of it a later date and be ok?  I'm a wreck as you can see and need some help.  Thanks

"Hi everyone,
I've been taking mirtazapine for roughly 2.5 years (a gap off approximately 6 months in between about 6 months ago.
I've always had the generic brand as it's always offered and is a bit cheaper. 
I lucked out at my local chemist when I last filled my prescription a few weeks ago. They didn't have any generic brand left so I had to get the brand name. $5 more and tastes worse. I get the soluble kind due to not liking swallowing tablets.
Long story short, I know that the likelihood of the medication not working in the same way is limited however I have noticed myself feeling not as well as I normally would from taking it. 
Has anyone else experienced something like this? Could simply be mind over matter but nothing else has changed.

"Hi all, so I've been on mirtazapine for nearly a year and have worked my way up to 45mg I missed my first dose ever a few nights ago, I got it out to take then got side tracked by my kids and thought I'd taken it, wasn't till the next morning I realised I hadn't, I took my next dose at normal time the next night and woke up really tired and stayed that way all day, the same thing has happened today, just seeing if anyone knows how long it will last, I never normally have fatigue the next day when taking it, I've also been a lot more anxious but I expect that as I am on it for anxiety, it was the fatigue I hadn't expected, just want  to go back to feeling normal, thank you!!

"Now before anyone accuses me of being an alcoholic, etc. ""you shouldn't drink on ADs,"" let me explain. Ive been on 7 or 8 straight meds now, none of which have done what I was hoping they'd do.  I have severely cut back my social life over the past 15 months to get better, and am just back where I started, with an even more negative view on meds now.  I stopped Remeron cold turkey 5 days ago, and was supposed to fill another script for another drug, but said screw it.. my body just literally needs a break.  I have pumped so many different pills through it (I get that alcohol is probably terrible to pump through it too), but it's more of a mental ""F you"" to all the meds I've taken that didn't agree with me.  So I wanna go out and enjoy myself for once and then get back on track starting Monday.  It's been 5 days, is the Mirt. still in my system?
btw, withdrawals haven't been negative at all for me.. if anything, I feel a broad range of emotions again and feel decent.. weird.

"Hello guys...I'm new to this forum and after some advice/reassurance.
I was on Mirtazapine for about 9 mths....initially 15mg then went up to 45mg. Mainly to help with sleep and low mood.
I decided that I wanted to come off the meds as I didn't want to be on them anymore.
Anyway I saw a Dr (not my usual Dr) who just gave me 30mg for 2 mths. Then I took 15mg for 2 mths and then went cold turkey. I was ok for about a week then the withdrawal symptoms hit me like a tonne of bricks. Feeling sick, no appetite. The insomnia is absolutely horrendous!!!!!!! I haven't slept properly for weeks. Ended up getting some sleeping tablets from my Dr. I only take these if I really need to. I've also got a constant headache... Is this normal?
So cross as I feel I didn't get the correct advice about tapering off Mirtazapine.

"Been taking 40mg Paroxetine for 22 years which worked really well. However due to the occasional blip it was decided to try switching to Mirtazapine. Stupidly decided to go cold turkey once i had tapered down to 20mg. After 3 weeks i wasn't coping well & informed the doctor about what i had done. Was subsequently put back on the Paroxetine 40mg. Now that i am back on the Paroxetine (7/8 weeks) i want to drop the Mirtazapine. I have been on 15/30mg Mirtazapine for approx 4 months. The doctor told me to drop from 30 to 15mg for 2 weeks & then come off. However after researching tapering i decided this was too quick. So i tapered from 30mg to 22.5mg the main problem that i have is insomnia, this started even when i had been on 30mg. At first i could sleep but all of a sudden i was struck with insomnia, something which i have never suffered from before. I have been on 22.5mg for a week now & apart from the insomnia i am feeling ok. Thinking of dropping the dose tonight to 15mg because i know no matter how slow i taper withdrawals are inevitable & i really don't want to lengthen the process. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

"Sorry for my poor English but I will try my best to explain my story
I started taking antidepressants for chronic headache in 2012 and tapered all the pills in 2015 April . I was in a new city by then and my withdrawal symptoms were so severe that I couldn't sleep for a month and my doctor advised me to take escitalopram (10 mg), clonazepam (0.5 mg) and mirtazapine (7.5mg). I started living my life again. Last year I tapered escitalopram and clonazepam without any withdrawal. But life became hell when I lowered my dosage of mirtazapine from 7.5 to 3.5 mg. Insomnia, anxiety, weird feelings in body, brain fog etc. My doctor increased my dosage to 11.25 mg but that didn't help out either. After 2 months I decided to taper again and my tapering schedule was like this :
7.5 mg 2 years
3.75 mg 1 week
11.25 mg 2 months
9.375 mg 10 days
7.5 mg 10 days
5.625 mg 10 days
3.75 mg 10 days
1.875 10 days
I have started taking ashwagandha (an Indian herb) at night time which is helping me with my anxiety.
I was thinking of tapering by making liquid solution but I am leaving to USA on 22nd July for my higher studies and I want get rid of this pill completely by then.
Now I will use the same strategy I used to taper escitalopram. From today onwards I ll start taking 0.9 mg for 7 days and then 0.9 mg on alternate days and then 0.9 mg every three days and so on.
My main issue right now is sleep and I have only been sleeping for 3-4 hours since I started taper. I am not getting enough sleep but Thanks to ashwagandha, vitamin d, vitamin b12 because I don't feel anxious even after the sleep deprivation.

I have tapered down very slowly on mirtazapine and am now on 5.5mg. I have had on/ off insomnia throughout being in this med ( one of reasons I was put on it too).
The best dose for me was 7.5mg and I usually slept ok. If I didn't, my sleep had always settled down after a few nights. I've tapered from 7.5-6 and now on 5.5mg (I've tapered over 3 months) and after 3 weeks of feeling groggy ad putting this down to withdrawal symptoms, my insomnia is back, but really awful! I thought my brain was settling and adjusting to the new dose, but I literally have not slept properly for about a week now! Can anyone relate?

"I have been on mirtazipine 45mg for 5 years,plus citalopram 40mg after severe clinical depression,that was so very bad to the point of thinking suicide was the better option.it took a very long time on these drugs,up to a year before I began to feel really well.would have been prepared to stay on these drugs for life if I hadn't had such severe side effects that are no longer tolerable.mainly very severe nightmares and terrors that I can't wake up from,and eventually when I do,go straight back into if I try to resume sleep.weight gain also a side effect,despite dieting,but one I was prepared to accept,but can't live with nightmares anymore.I also have medical conditions of prolapsed spinal discs and spinal stenosis,so severe pain at times and cervical spondylosis.plus irritable bowel syndrome.
may 17th decided to reduce from 45mg to 30mg,had some side effects,head swimming and dizziness and heart palpitations,plus increase in anxiety levels,but just ate well and rode out the storm and eventually theses side effects subsided.still nightmares persisted.on 29th July reduced to 15mg.suffered severe nausea,plus had symptoms diagnosed by GP as trapped nerve in neck,as severe neck and arm pain,so as I was coping with this new problem decided to restart 30mg mirtazipine.after 10 days trapped nerve improved.
11th Aug reduced mirtazipine from 30mg to 15mg.after 2 days had severe nausea,so cut tablets half and went to 22.5mg dose,had side effects sweats,slight nausea,head swimming and more anxiety,but persevered and eventually resolved,but nightmares persisted.
on 12th Sep reduced from 22.5mg to 15mg,have severe neck pain and severely tight painfull muscles top of back plus arm muscle pains and shoulder painsonce again,convinced this is due to decrease mirtazepine,not sure whether to try and stick with it and ride it out,or go back to 22.5mg and make GP appointment ane ask for liquid mirtazipine,to reduce even slower.
as most GP have no idea of all these side effects not sure she won't just think it's all in my mind.also not sure perhaps my cervical spondylosis has got much worse over 5 years on mirtazepine,but symptoms have been alleviated by this drug.
dont know what to do!

"Greetings everyone,
I had been taking Mirtazapine ever since 6 years ago on a 15mg dose. Recently (4 weeks ago) I stopped after tapering down to 3.75mg. The first week everything went really well, no issues whatsoever. After the 10th day the tipical withdrawal issues started to crop up (slight nausea, itching in different extremities, flu-like symptoms, and of course... the insomnia).
The most difficult symptom to deal with for me right now is the insomnia. There are days where I sleep 2.5 hours which is maddening. There are other days where thankfully, I get to sleep 6 hours or so.
For those who have withdrawn from remeron/mirtazapine has the insomnia subdued? And if so, how long did it take and what dose where you at before quitting?
Thanks!

"background - have been depressed for 15 plays years and have tried numerous medication.  Escitalopram was the latest which seemed to help with the depression but my insomnia was worse than ever.  I was only sleeping around 3 hours per night, which counteracted the benefits of not feeling depressed.  
My dr has prescribed mirtazapine which I started last night.  I took it at around 8pm and I've only just gotten up 10:40am). My husband took the day off work today so I could start them but normally I need to be up for 6:30 ready for school run.  I feel awful, even my mouth is numb.  I must have slept, although I remember tossing and turning a lot, and I had weird, vivid dreams (not nightmares). The GP gave me these tablets for insomnia as they help both but I feel like @@@.
on escitalopram even zoliclone at the highest dose didn't help.  What do I do?  I'm going to have to go back to bed as I feel so spaced out.  I'm going to try and phone the GP but I've got to get past the gestapo receptionist so I might not be successful.  Does it get better or should I cut my losses and nit take any more?

Having said all this it's become obvious to me that weaning isn't going to work for me and I was wondering if anyone got off successfully by going cold turkey as it seems like my only option to get off of mirtazapine.

"Just started Mirtazapine last night.. Sedated me completely within 30 minutes. Problem is I slept 15 hours, and woke up to go to work and still felt like I could fall asleep on my feet.  5 coffees throughout my shift, and I could STILL fall asleep on my feet.  It was awful.  I told everyone I took Benadryl before my shift.  It's been 15 straight months of trying to find a medicine that will work for me.  Add to that, I switched to the Remeron and haven't been on Effexor in 2 days, so the intense brain shocks on top of the out of this worldly drowsiness.  Got home from my shift at work and couldn't help but break down.  About ready to give up on the medicine route all together.  Can someone please tell me if this passes.  If it doesn't I'm calling my doc tomorrow and stopping this ASAP.  It's not like I can sort of function, if I didn't sleep those 12+ hours, I literally would not have been able to.  Starting to lose all hope with medications, as this is my 7th straight.

"Hi. I have previously been on fluoxetine on and off since I was 18. I'm 36 now. At the end of last year I ended my relationship with my boyfriend. Whilst I'm glad I did, at first I was a bit peeved that he didn't care. So the back end of last year that coupled with university exams, etc I was a bit stressed. The start of this year, newly single I started going out drinking more with classmate. This probably made me feel more depressed and that my fluoxetine wasn't working. I went to my GP and she told me to go up to 60mg. I did. Still continued partying. My classmate made me go to A&E cos she thought I was suicidal on the 31/01/17. They told me to go up to 90mg of fluoxetine. I said I didn't think this was a good idea but took the advice along with the sleeping pills given to me. I should mention my classmate is on Venlafaxine herself. There was trouble in college between her and others and a falling out which lead to them not talking to me either. My friend's father also died a couple of weeks later so I was feeling extremely low. I got an appointment with the psychiatrist on April 10. He diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and prescribed me Venlafaxine. Told me to take 75mg for two days, 150mg for two and then 225mg therein if tolerated. I couldn't so I switched down to 150mg. On my follow up visit on 22 May I said that I felt terrible on the tablets. My depression was far worse than it had ever been. Had stopped going to college, etc. He then prescribed me mirtazapine at 15mg to take in conjunction with the Venlafaxine. Now on this mixture I just felt weird. Night sweats started with me changing my pjs up to three times a night and having to have shower at 4am on numerous occasions. Strangely tho on my follow up appointment on 12th June I claimed I was feeling 8/10 and wanted to continue on this mixture. Had reduced the Venlafaxine to 75mg at this point. Think I felt OK that day cos I had my brother staying with me the previous week and I otherwise live alone. A week later and I just became an irritated, highly emotional, in motivational, irrational MESS. Was meant to be back in on august 14 for review but last Tuesday 18 July my mam made me go to my GP who sent me straight to A&E as I just wanted to die. I saw no hope whatsoever for my future. Obsessing over a failed fling I had with a guy, not able to concentrate on the college work I need to do next month. I just wanted the pain to end. On call psych told me to take quetiapine on top of my meds until the following Monday, this Monday, when my psych could see me. I stopped taking the mirtazapine tho. I know I shouldn't have. Anyway this Monday the psych told me to discontinue my use of Venlafaxine altogether and start taking the mirtazapine again but at 30mg. Now I'm having withdrawals and I feel awful. Dizzy, drunk feeling, vertigo, nausea, insomnia, irritability, no motivation, suicide idealation and a feeling of worthlessness. I don't even want to take the mirtazapine either. I wish I had never taken either. I think I felt bad on the fluoxetine because of my drinking and the things that were going on at the time. Now life is pretty hard for me. I'm just so angry with myself for all the mistakes I've made this year and I can't move on from it. I know it's the tablets tho. I feel a failure because I left a well paid job to return to college to better myself and I am going to have to repeat the semester in January now because I can't concentrate to do repeats next month plus I never went to class. Ironically I am in the second year of a BA (Hons) in Psychology. I have wrote way too long a message here but I just feel so helpless. I must mention when I said to my psych what happens if I can't tolerate the mirtazapine he said to come off it as it ""would be interesting to see how you are on no medication""! Poor thing to say to someone who feels suicidal I think.

"Hello All
I was on mirt 7.5mg for 2 years along with escitalopram and clonazepam due to insomnia . Last year I successfully tapered escitalopram and clonazepam. This year I went down to 3.75mg from 7.5mg and insomnia was so scary that I went to 11.25mg for 2 months. But it didn't help so I tapered down to 0.4mg every 3 days. I came to usa last month for my higher studies. It was hard for me focusing on the class so I started with 1.875mg and it worked for 3 days. Day before Yesterday I increased the dose to 7.5mg and I had the best sleep after 6 months but yesterday I got only 2-3 hours of sleep. I have my exam on Monday and I have an appointment with doctor on Tuesday.
I m afraid that mirtazapine has stopped working on my body and doctor will put me on some other medication which has sexual side effects. Shall I add 0.25mg clonazepam on the top of mirt7.5mg because I have my exam on Monday?

"Hi, Everyone. I want to give you a run down on my feelings and help with coming off Mirtz.
Firstly I was put on this drug on July 5th. I had lost weight and had no appetite as I  was experiencing daily panic attacks with a long history of anxiety. I started on 7.5mg and things were ok to sleep was good etc. Moved up to 15mg on 2nd August.. and have had massive stomach trouble since with still weight loss cramps burning. Had all test done gastroscopy full blood and I can only work out that this might be contributing to the problem. My doctor says 90% of serotonin is in the stomach. I want to come off this drug now so whats the best way of doing this from 6 weeks on the drug?
Should I go 7.5mg tonight? The doctor wants to try something else but I want to go free from medication and continue my weekly CBT therapy with my psych.
Please help.

"Hi everyone 
I'm new to this 
But I started on 15mg 2/3 weeks ago 
My period was due 6 days ago and I'm late!!!
I'm not pregnant but I'm usually really regular. I've read that a side effect can be your menstral cycle? 
I've also been trying to conceive for just over a year and now worrying all the past years work has been for nothing / waste of time and back to square on as I know it'll effect my ovulation : periods
Can anyone shed some light on this ? 
Or how soon did your period start after coming off these ?

" I have been suffering with depression for 12 half yrs but in the last 2 yrs it's hit me hard. I was taken prozac for 12 half yrs and went to the doctor and said I've hit rock bottom and the Meds I'm taking for my depression isn't working. So he started me on Mirtazapine 30mg one at night. I took it for 4wks and said I don't think it made a difference?. I went to see another Dr and explain what's happening? So she up me to 45mg one at night. I was wondering when I should notice a difference? At the moment I feel worse for ware about 3time a day. Silly thoughts come to mind and I start dewelling on it for the rest of the day. I only go bed when I'm tired because I can't sleep. Then when I finely settle I'm up and down like a yo-yo.
Another question can this medication cause night sweats I never experienced this before. I was cold and chives but when trying to warm my self up I'd sweat to the point head and hair like I've just got out of the shower?.

"Hi everyone. 
I just wanted to post post my mirtazapine experience here to get it off my chest and to get some advice hopefully. I've been on 15mg of mirtazapine for about a year and a half. I had a health scare back in 2015 and it shook me up so bad I developed horrible anxiety/depression. I was so desperate for relief I think I'd have probably taken anything I was prescribed against my better judgement. Anyhow, I've had a load of strange physical symptoms over the past year and have always thought something was seriously wrong with me, i.e. That I had some sort of disease or something. Well, I was just instructed to increase my mirt dosage a week ago and as it turns out, it seems all of my physical symptoms have been the mirt this whole time. Terrible back pain, dizzy spells, faster than normal heart rate, hot flashes, awful weakness... I experienced these symptoms for several months when starting the mirt, however between my anxiety, and the other meds I was being tried on at the same time, I never put 2 and 2 together. I thought the illness was getting worse... however, in light of all the symptoms resurfacing upon raising the dose it seems pretty obvious it's the mirt. 
Now i I have the dilemma of what to do next. I've been on the 30mg for a week. Do you think I'd be ok to drop back down to the 15mg without a taper? And then where do I go from there? I've read terrible horror stories about withdrawal from this drug. I know everyone is different, but I really don't feel prepared to endure withdrawal right now. But I don't want to continue to feel so awful. Damned if I do, damned if I don't situation. 
Anyhow, advice is greatly appreciated... also wanted to post my experience in case someone out there might be going through something similar and expects that perhaps the mirt is the cause.

"Method of tapper:
day 1 @ 30 mgs.
days 2&3  @15 mgs
Followed that method (no worrisome disturbing side effects)  Did that for 3 weeks.
day 1-30 @15 slight side effects of mild headaches, fatigue, mild vision disturbance, mild internal tremors.  Nothing to scare me or that I couldn't handle. Followed that method for a month.  Sleeping fine.
After a month @15 mgs tappered to 7.5.
This is my 5th day at that dose. I now know that I should have used my prior method of alternating 15 with 7.5.
I can hardly walk straight, visual distortion comes and goes and if frightening, internal tremors top hallf of body moving to bottom half of body.  Taking deep breaths because I feel like I'm not getting enough air and my brain feels like a chunk of wood atop my shoulders and like a band is around it squeezing.  I'm going back to bed.  Can't do anything or concentrate/focus at all. I hope I can sleep.
Was going to call doc but I know he would just tell me to start taking the Cymbalta he gave me script for 3 months.  I don't think I want to get on this roller coaster again.  Xanax seems to handle my anxiety (well almost) but it's lack of sleep that is a real problem.  It's a form of torture.
I'll keep ya all updated on my progress just as an FYI  in case you decide to withdraw. Wish me luck.

I have never known anything like it. My Dr gave me some Zopiclone but I'm only really taking it every other night. I have other things going on too which may be contributing to poor sleep. I have high cortisol levels which is causing alot of health issues.
So my question is, is insomnia normal withdrawal (cold turkey more a less as Dr didn't tell me the correct way to taper off) from Mirtazapine??? I know everyone is different but when should I start feeling better again????

"Hi All
I started taking ssri, snri and benzodiopine in 2012 for chronic nerve pain and little bit of sleep problem caused by it. I stopped taking them in 2015 and I couldn't sleep for straight 15 days. Started taking escitalopram, clonazepam and mirt (7.5mg). I tapered escitalopram and clonazepam successfully. I reduced my mirtazapine to 3.75 mg and insomnia returned within a week. My doc increased the dosage to 11.25mg for 2 months but that didn't help either. Then I started a slow taper and I am now taking (0.2-0.4 mg) for last 2 months.
Last 6 months were very tough. I have come all the way to usa from India for my higher studies. I got an admit from top university but still I chose an average university because of the withdrawal symptoms. I have compromised on lot of things during last 6 months. Apart from insomnia there hasn't been a single day that I have felt happy. No excitement in coming to usa. I don't feel motivated. My libido has gone down and I m just 25. I am not sure if I ll be able to give my best in exams. I stay lost and confused during class.
This is the second time I am off antidepressants and I cannot live like this for rest of my life. I have already lost a lot of things due to the horrific withdrawal symptoms.
I am taking vitamin d, vitamin b, magnesium, ashwagandha,5htp, herbs and they have worked for some days but still I don't feel like real myself.
My question :
Can I start taking 1.875mg on a daily basis for rest of my life?
PS: I didn't feel any side effects on 7.5 mg for 2 years and I felt best on mirt for these 2 years . Currently I m sleeping for 4-5 hours but I don't feel refreshed the next day.

"Not sure if anyone can relate to anything I am writing?
In 2005 I was diagnosed with OCD (Pure O) and was experiencing depression alongside.
I was prescibed Mirtzapine - starting at 15mg for 1 week , then 30mg.
I carried on taking this dose for the next 7 years and then decided to come off as I felt good & Mirtzapine was making me quite angry in last year or 2 of use.  Withdrawal gradually seemed to be succesful to, with little / No side effects.
This year my OCD has taken a bad turn for the worst and I spoke to my G.P who suggested I try Mirtzapine once more as it worked so well beforehand. So I followed the same format 15mg then up to 30mg once more. Was at the 30mg dose for 12-14 weeks.
This time round however it was not as sedating as before, although 30mg I know is less sedating than the lower doses, it always used to do the trick for sleep? The normal increase in appetite has also happened but this time round 30mg was making me emotionally numb and just very flat with no effect on my anxiety / ocd thoughts.
Had a couple of strange episodes on it too this time round that I can remember where I instantly had a feeling of hapiness with a feeling of having no issues (not quite mania) but it felt chemical and when It kicked in I had to take a few minutes to adjust as I went from low to happy but this only lasted a few hours and I was back on my knees again.
I finally got to see a psychiatrist a few weeks ago , who suggested I should be put on an approved OCD Medication, in this case Setraline and that I could take this alongside the Mirtzapine at 15mg so I could still benefit from the sleep properties.
I am now 2 weeks in to both medications and not wanting to tempt fate but my depression & mood have started to lift.
Being my normal curious / ocd self however i wanted peoples opinion on why the 30mg dose of Mirtzapine never did the trick as it did before? Have I become tolerent, would another option to have gone higher on the dose to 45mg?
It was great for me 12 years ago, perhaps 7 years of taking was too much but there has been a 5 year gap between stopping and now?
Weirdly aswell last year before the onset of my recent OCD episode I was experiencing bad IBS (Loose stools daily), since taking AD'S again this seems to have cleared up?
Anyhow not knocking feeling a bit better as I was in a bad place 3 weeks ago and my OCD was taking over, believing I was becoming a different person. Just surprised on one hand how Setraline as made a difference and Mirtzapine not working or as effective.
Can anyone relate or explain????

"Hi, I've been on varying amounts of Mirtazapine for 12 months, initially for depression. It worked for about the first 6 months but I started to feel depressed again and increasingly anxious. My GP increased my dose from 30Mg to 45Mg in an attempt to settle me down again but with out any improvement.
I began to wonder if the Mirt. was the cause of my depression and was I now actually ready to come off the treatment? 3 Doctors at my GP surgery had different views, some saying stop and others saying try different doeses, so I was properly confused as to what to do!
So I took the decision to stop Mirt and one doctor said to reduce the 30 Mg dose, come down to 15 Mg in 2 weeks and then stop althogether, which is what I have done.
I am now in deep distress! I am anxious, suffering nausea, cannot eat and generally feel like ending it all! I am permanently worried that I'll always feel like this, will I ever recover and be my old self again. Having read all the ""blogs"" I now realise that I should not have taken the strict medical advice and I should have come down more slowly, down to 7.5Mg and reduced over a much longer period.
But I am now where I am, I cannot go back to the doctors who will possibly presribe more drugs, which is just not acceptable. 
I have consulted a natural health consultant who has put me on a serotonin tablet and given me anxiety-relieff tablets but nothing's working.

It's mostly in the morning, and I wake with a dry mouth. I also get very nasty dizziness after any short bursts of strenuous activity - just lifting a heavy box from one place to another is enough to make me need to sit down for a while.

"Hi everyone,
I thought I'd share my experience coming off of Mirt, as I'm still sort of battling the withdrawal effects right now. I tapered, admittedly, a little fast. I was on 30mg of Mirtazapine for 2+ years for anxiety. It was great for a while, but recently felt as though the drug has run it's course. I put on some extra weight, and felt like I never had energy, even though I was sleeping well.
After talking to my doctor, I decided to taper. I took 22.5mg for about a week, went down to 15mg for another week, then down to 7.5mg for another week. I wasn't really feeling any withdrawal symptoms during this time. Two weeks ago, I came off completely from 7.5mg. That first week, i could not sleep more than 2-3 hours a night. I've never had insomnia before, even before I was taking Mirt, and just chalked it up to the withdrawal and that eventually it would subside. My sleeping has been slowly getting better. Some nights better than others, bit I'm getting about 6-7 hours a night, which is fine by me.
I've definitely had some rebound anxiety, but am using a steady dose of ativan to control that, which has been a life saver. Not too worried about the ativan dependence, as a few years ago I was on a much higher clonazepam prescription that I eventually came off of (now THAT was hell)!
The most annoying withdrawal effect that I've been dealing with is the itching and rashes that I've suddenly developed. I have this eczema type rash that started while I was on the Mirt (never had skin problems before the Mirt), and has since spread lile wildfire, since coming off it a couple weeks ago. The itching is contributing to whatever insomnia that I have left, as I'm up all night scratching. Benadryl has helped somewhat, but was hoping maybe someone here has been through the same. Will these rashes eventually subside?

"I've been on Mirtazapine for several years now because of serious depression but the strange thing is that is seems to be doing less and less for me now. I used to feel real good on it. I don't really sleep that well and have loads of weird dreams, usually feel tired and flat in the day, emotionally numb quite often. The thing that seems to be getting worse recently is the irritability, people and things are really getting to me and I feel like i'm gonna flip out and smash something. Depression seems worse too and its getting harder to cope. I also seem to have mental difficulties like when I'm studying for university work its like my brain is all fuzzy and just doesn't work right and I can't think clearly. I also get very light headed standing up quite often though that varies. Of course it is possible that these things are the symptom of some other problem but hopefully not. Anyone else relate to this? I'm gonna go to my GP anyway to try something else.

"Hiya, 
I'm currently three days off avanza :D I was only taking 15mg for about six months, and then I would taper off 1mg every three-four days which was fine and no problem (at the recommendation of my doctor).
I also have GERD, which is why I don't know if these are withdrawal symptoms or just my GERD acting a bit differently to normal.
I have been feeling more nervous and anxious than normal and a bit more nauseated than normal, (which isn't new as much of my anxiety manifests in feeling nauseated) yet today all of a sudden I got a really bad stomach ache but I am not really nauseated.. I took some gaviscon which helped for about 30minutes but it's back. Ginger tea, some plain crackers etc. didn't help like they normally would. It's just a constant ache at about 5-6/10, not debilitating but not comfortable. As I've never had this with my GERD before, I was wondering if anyone else got stomach aches on their withdrawals and how long I can expect withdrawal symptoms (if it even is withdrawal causing this) to last as I only took it at a low dosage for not very long.
Thank you in advance!

"Hi guys, 
I'm new here and was really hoping to get some answers: I keep searching on forums for situation similar to mine, but can't find anything.
I started on Mit at 15mg for acute insomnia at the end of Jan 2017.
That dose was too strong, so went down to 7.5mg in 2 weeks.
Then March 1 down to 5mg.
Each time I would go down on a dose some sleep regression followed, but would usually resolve in 1-2 days and sleep would even imrpove some.
Going from 5 to 3.75 was more difficult: some anxiety, sleep got pretty bad. I decided to slow down and got 1mg and 0.5mg pill from a compounding pharmacy. So from 5mg I went down to 4, 3.5, 3, 2,5, 2, 1.5, 1 – all in 2 week intervals. Some minore bumps with sleep here and there, nothing of exraordinary. I thought I'm DONE. I took 0.5mg for 5 days and stopped. I didn't even think about it anymore, slept great.
Then 1 week out had a first night with 0 sleep. I thought this was just one last bump on the way out. Slept better the following week. Then at 2 weeks off it hit me again, progressivly harder: 5 hours a night, then 3 hours, then again 0. 
I panicked and went back to 1mg, thinking may be I jumped off too quickly  from that last dose. I honestly didn't think it was doing anything anymore!
This time I got 0.2mg pills and decided to go a bit slower. 
I stayed on 1mg for 3 days – imediate improvement.
Went down to 0.7mg for 1 week – still feeling good.
Went down to 0.5mg – same night couldn't sleep.
Went up to 0.6mg for a week – slept well.
But tonight again – 0 sleep. 2 weeks to a day since I went down from 7mg to 0.7mg. Plus some anxiety (but I think it's just about sleep). 
So my QUESTIONS: should I wait at 0.6mg and see? Should I go back up? If yes, than to what dose? 0.7? 1? And then going down even slower? Does the 10% rule apply to below 1mg? We are talking 0.00 then, it gets ridicolous. Would going from 0.7 down in 0.1 increments be better? Or should I just stop all together and ride this rebound insomnia out?
I'm doing all the ""right"" things for insomnia otherwise: esxersize, eat healthy, go to/get out of bed at same time, starting accupuncture, taking natural supplements etc. 
Any advice or success stroies on this last leg of taper is very much appreciated!

"Hello
so about 3 months ago i started having really bad panic/anxiety... Was not eating and was shivering all the time. This happened with me for the first time in life. Went to psychiatrist he prescribed me on 30mg remeron. The first time i took the tablet i was very lightheaded and dizzy so doctro reduced the dosage to half...means 15 mg..and I started feeling a bit better in few days...
Now after about 2 months and 10 days.. I have increased the dosage to 30mg..and my fears are sort of increased the next day.. Am more nervous..shacky...anxious...
Is this common..? Will I be okay in a few days.? Does anyone here can realted to this..? Or should I go back to 15mg.. Cant talk to doc at the moment..

"I saw my P doc 10days ago & was very lost in biploar depression. I mentioned that I was struggling with the really bad nightmares & increased salivation. The nightmares were affecting my quality if sleep & I felt dread upon waking up including after a nap. Weight wise I logged my weight once a week and didn't gain weight on 15mg since starting at 3months ago. Although I was frequently bloated which looked like weight gain.
I am glad I am off Mirt now & with no withdrawal side effects. Although its not certain as I was experiencing a bad relapse just before stopping Mirt.
I asked a CPN about withdrawal symptoms after 2 days if stopping Mirt and she had also previously been on 15mg the smallest standard dose & come off it without titrating it & no withdrawal symptoms.
So I thought I would share this here because it can be equally frightening starting & stopping psychiatric meds and the med becomes the focus of everything and its hard to know what's going on and reading too mych info can make the process worse. She wisely told me if we think it it can end up being a symptom and her being qualified & with personal experience of Mirt I have done my best to not look up info here and just let time run its course with stopping Mirt. Upon stopping Mirt my P doc also increased my Seroxat from 40mg to 60mg which might have helped me adjust too. My apppetite has increased hugely the last couple of days though so I'll keep an eye on that.
I hope my this post is of help to anyone due to or considering withdrawal from Mirtazipine and its going to be a different experience for each individual.
Peace & Best Wishes

"Hey everyone,
I've been on Mirtazapine since the end of Dec. I was originally on 30mg and feeling really good in March, but then started to feel pretty crappy and decided I wanted to come off of it.
I went down to 22.5mg in May, then 5 days later, went to 15mg (advice from a doctor). I somehow made it through a work trip internationally the next week, but was feeling very anxious. I spent most of June in bed feeling terrified. It's started to get a bit better, but I'm still feeling strong symptoms.
My muscles are incredibly weak - it's hard to pick up a tea kettle with water. I feel dizzy off and on, but it's a particular dizziness where I feel like I'm on a boat, bobbing up and down.
Sedation is to be expected, especially at 15mg, and gets better as the day goes on. But the worst part is that early in the day, especially between about 11am and 2pm, I feel terror. It's not something I've ever experienced and it's not anxiety. It feels like I'm about to break in half or that I'm being attacked. As the day goes on the sedation and the terror start to lift and I generally feel better, though exhausted.
I can still function during it - but it feels so awful. Any thoughts?
My doc wants me to go back up to 30mg, but I don't know if I should.
Thanks so much.

"Hi All
Started taking Escitalopram(10mg), Clonazepam (0.5 mg) and Mirtazapine(7.5 mg) in May 2015 . Below is my tapering update
Clonazepam(0.5) - Tapered after 1 year 
Escitalopram(10mg) - tapered after 1 year 4 months
Mirtazapine(7.5 mg) - reduced the dosage to 3.75 mg after 20 months usage on January 18 and started feeling withdrawal from 26th January. Withdrawal symptoms include insomnia, Anxiety, and strange feeling within the body. Increased my dosage from 3.75 mg to 11.25 mg for 2 months but I didn't feel better so decided to come off this medication. Started tapering 11.25 from April 1st this year and now I am taking 0.4-0.9 mg alternate days. The only day I slept properly in these six months was when I took cetirizine this month. I started taking some herbs and vitamin supplements and they did help. Below are my queries:
Q1 : I have started taking 5HTP (50 mg) from today onwards. What are the withdrawal symptoms of this supplement?
Q2 : I am going to USA for my higher studies on 26 July. Shall I increase my Mirt dose there to overcome Jet Lag?
Q3 : Can I carry mirtazapine pills from India to USA? Will customs officers allow me to enter with these pills?
PS : Sometimes I think that I was so happy on 7.5 mg mirtazapine and I should not have messed up with my dosage. And please don't suggest that I should consult my GP because she doesn't believe in antidepressants withdrawal. She thinks that everything is in my head. I believe these doctors should try taking these drugs then they will come to know about AD withdrawal.

"Hi, I need some help. 
I was on Mirtazapine for about 6 months on 45mg. I felt like it wasn't helping as much as it used to so I asked to swap to something else. My doctor had me change to Cymbalta and he told me to just swap, no tapering. I stopped taking Mirtazapine and waited a few days before talking Cymbalta for a week and a half.
Cymbalta turned out to be terrible, I couldn't stay on it. But now I'm having withdrawals from them both. I have so much anxiety its ruining my life. I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I feel so nauseous that I cannot function. I am so anxious despite nothing bad happening. I am sat here doing nothing but my hands are shaking, my knees are shaking, it feels like my chest is being pushed down and my throat is tight and my stomach is tense and all I can think about is anxiety. It's been like this for a week and a half. I've lashed out at everyone in my life because this is killing me. 
I don't know what to do. I can't function. I can't get a doctor appointment before the 7th. I just want to go back on the Mirtazapine so this anxiety stops but I don't know if I should or not. 
I don't know what to do. Has anyone else gone cold turkey from 45mg Mirtazapine, and how do I deal with these withdrawals? Can I just take Mirtazapine again?
Sorry for the long, rambly post.

"I had posted before that my Internal Medicine specialist had prescribed 60 mg's of Mirtazapine at bedtime primarily for sleep. He also prescribed 900 mg's of Gabapentin and 60 mg's of Baclofen daily for what he was calling ""Fibromyalgia symptoms."" I was experiencing pain in my sternum, back, arm and leg, mostly on the right side of my body. I since paid for an entire spine MRI and it showed spinal stenosis, disc bulging and bone spurring primarily on my cervical and lumbar spine. The Internal Medicine specialist basically said that the MRI results weren't that bad and was not causing any of my pain. If anything, he cited that the MRI showed that the pain should be on my left side but not severe enough to be a problem. Again, ""you have Fibromyalgia."" Anyways, long story short; he placed me on the above medications to help with the pain and sleep problems associated with said pain. Things were much worse on the medications. As a result, in the last six weeks or so I have cut the above medications down as follows: Mirtazapine - 60 mg's to 15 mg's at bedtime - Gabapentin - 900 mg's to 300 mg's per day - Baclofen - 60 mg's to 15 mg's per day. If it were possible, the pain, muscle spasms and have gotten even worse since tapering off of these medications. Not only pain but painful vibrations and muscle spasms and tremors that run up my spine into my cranium. Also, down my right shoulder into my chest, arm and leg. A lot of spinal rigidity starting about twelve hours after my last dose of Mirtazapine which was also occurring while on the 60 mg per day dosage. The muscle spasms also run across my chest and affect my voice. The Ear, Nose And Throat specialist said all looked normal and to see a Neurologist. I'm on the waiting list and it won't happen soon in our socialized medicine system. Could it be side effects from the Mirtazapine, Gabapentin or Baclofen that have caused some of these new symptoms? Or, is it possible withdrawal symptoms from any of the medications? A mixture of the drugs side effects and withdrawal? The three drugs prescribed as they were seems like overkill to me from what I've read since. My GP is of little help and I've dropped the Internal Medicine specialist. It's driving me over the edge...,  seriously! Thanks for any thoughts and advice.

"Hello,
I have recently been trying to re-stabalize myself on 40mg Citalopram, which I was taking and doing well on for almost 10 years. Since messing with my dosage, I have experienced insomnia, seemingly from dosage increase/decrease side effects.
I am just over a month back at 40mg Citalopram, but sleep hasn't quite returned to normal still and am having trouble sleeping without taking something. My psychiatrist prescribed me Mirtazapine 15mg as a sleep aid.
Aside from the awful day-after side effects, I am scared to use this to help with sleep in that so many people seem to have insomnia when they try and go off of it. I am scared that by starting to take Mirt, even if short-term, I will only bring about more insomnia in the long-run.
I would greatly appreciate any advice, thank you.

"Withdrawal symptoms, severity and length of time depend on the dosage, the length of time on the medication and the individual. Speaking as a health care professional and someone's who's titrated successfully off Mirtazepine I suggest the following:
Get in the mindset right now that you will get through this and symptoms related to withdrawal will go away. Once you're truly motivated:
Think of everything in 2's. If you're taking 15mg then reduce the dose by cutting in 2 for 2 weeks. So reduce to 7.5mg for 2 weeks.
After 2 weeks buy yourself a pill splitter from Amy local pharmacy and split the dose in 2. Now you're taking 3.75mg for 2 weeks.
Finally, using the pill splitter cut your dose in 2 down to 1.87mg for 2 weeks. Following this stop the Mirtazepine.
You will have insomnia the first 10 days or so after first reduction. But you'll then get back to sleep after two weeks as your body adjusts to the lower dosages. This will be a cycle until you're off the Mirtazepine. You may also experience:
Headaches
Decreased Appetite
Weight Loss
Fatigue from Insomnia
Anxiety
My absolute best recommendation is to keep your mind & body busy through out the entire titrating process. Exercise, work, but do not sit around watching tv etc. This will result in increased anxiety and in some people panick attacks due to a misunderstanding of their withdrawal symptoms.
Folks, you can all do this. Yes you're going to feel the above symptoms but remember this:
THE WITHDRAWAL WILL RESOLVE.

"I have been taking mirtazapine at 60mg per day for over 10 years now - I know that's a whopping big dose but due to chronic treatment resistant depression it was the only dose that actually worked. For over 8 years it worked brilliantly - lifted my depression, eased my anxiety and most importantly, enabled me to sleep. With it i got my life back, managed to hold down a full time professional job. I'd still get my down days and times where my mood was ultra low but generally I'd get over it fairly quickly. It numbed me out I guess and I didn't really cry anymore, the tear ducts seemed incapable of working! I figured this was the trade off for functioning and playing an active role in life after many years of not being able to work with debilitating acrophobia and social anxiety.
However, around two years ago things started to slide - I was working in a hugely stressful target driven environment and bullying was rife from other colleagues and middle management. I was getting more and more responsibility dumped on me and being the people pleaser and perfectionist I was, took it on without complaint. I started to get ill again - avoiding conversation at work, tearful, increasingly anxious and stressed. The biggest factor in my mood was the start of a terrible bout of insomnia where I just couldn't function. I couldn't get to sleep no matter what I tried - reading in bed, exercising, herbal teas, switching off TV, drinking malt drinks - nothing worked. Obviously this then led to a vicious circle - the lack of sleep made me feel more depressed and anxious and stressed and so it continued. Where I had always been used to going to bed around 10pm and falling into a deep sleep around an hour later without waking until my alarm went off at 6 - this literally stopped overnight. I would just lie there hour after hour counting down the clock until I'd have to get up. Or if I did finally manage to sleep I'd be awake an hour later going through the same countdown routine. Now obviously I put this down to my hugely stressful and by now loathsome job keeping me awake and making me depressed so I decided enough was enough and quit. I was fortunate to find another job very quickly with a huge pay increase and a management role. Ideally or so I thought, I had friends that worked there and the company was supportive of its staff - tada! Everything would be great - new job, great environment, I'd start sleeping again my depression would lift and everything would go back to normal...how wrong could I be...
The insomnia continued and my mood continued to plummet I became a wreck. Whereas I'd take enormous pride in my work, staying late completing projects to deadline I just gave up. I sat there every day in a complete haze - couldn't focus, tearful, shaking with anxiety, unable to deal with the smallest of jobs because my sleep deprived brain just couldn't function.. I was lucky to get 10 hours a week sleep in total, a walking zombie is the only way I could describe it. So I walked out - gave up on what could have been my dream job. I now believed I was burnt out from my previous job and I just needed time out to rest, take the pressure off, relax... Not once did I question the mirtazapine - how could I believe this was to blame when it had worked so wonderfully for all these years? It must have been me, I'd had a total breakdown but with time I'd be better surely?!
I didnt visit my Dr - the practice is next to useless and frankly I'd had enough of pych help. But nothing has improved at all - its been a year since I left work and I can not sleep at all - I'm getting more and more depressed by the day, more tired, more stressed, more hopeless. However, one day - two years too late- I had an epiphany- was the mirtazapine to blame? Had it stopped working? I had never been told this could happen. So. Here I am, this site has become my refuge, my only place of solace to know that others are going through similar things. Which finally led me to the conclusion that mirtazapine can actually poop out. I decided to start tapering off mirtazapine - its clearly not working anymore and has led me to believe that it actually may be causing me more harm than good. Seven weeks ago I dropped to 45 mg with few withdrawal effects apart from nausea in week 3 and daily headaches. Something strange happened at this drop - for the first three weeks I actually slept!!!! Three weeks of complete heaven uninterrupted blissful 8 hour sleep. It was absolutely wonderful but alas, short lived. The insomnia abruptly kicked in again and that's where I am right now again. I have since dropped to 30 mg a week ago, hoping that this may trigger another episode of sleep but nope, nothing. I've also been to my gp since then who basically advised he has no idea why the mirtazapine stops working and offered me nothing for my insominia . he advised I should carry on with the reduction and be off them altogether over the next three months or so. But, now what? I'm depressed and have chronic insomnia - do I try something else? Is there another anti depressant which could help me? Because I can't carry on like this, I have no life and no future if I can't get something sorted soon.
Thank you for reading this, I so hope someone can offer some advice.

A week ago at the doctor's recommendation, I stopped taking the mirtazapine because I had been on it only two weeks, and I was on only 15 mg.
The night after I stopped the medication, I had severe nausea, vomiting, headache, unsteadiness on my feet (like standing on a boat's deck in a storm), nystagmus, and at the same time, a sound like a light saber from Star Wars. Weird!
Although the nausea has stopped, the most disturbing problem remaining is the nystagmus. It happens when I look sideways, and I get 3-5 flicks of my eyes, accompanied by the ""light saber"" sound.
Has anyone had a similar problem? If so, does it subside?
I'm still having withdrawal symptoms besides the nystagmus -- insomnia, jitteriness, irritability, headaches, huge appetite, and sensitivity to light and sound. I'm not going to taper off -- I'm just going to tough it out. I'm going to look into conservative ways to detox, too.

"Since being on mirtazipine I've gained 10kg!
I'm currently on a dosage of 45mg at night. From tonight 17/05/17 I'm going to take half (22.5mg) for the next week. Then half again (11.25) for a week. Then go cold turkey.
My doctors are not helpful and I've been asking to come off mirtazipine for 2 months. They just keep saying that I need to wait for the referral to the psychiatrist. Which could take up to 6 months. I really can't risk the current weight gain I'm on. I don't fit in any of my clothes and I am so self conscious. It makes me cry all the time. I feel so fat and ugly.
Will keep you updated. Anyone think I'll have really bad withdrawals? I'm so angry that I was put on medication that would give me withdrawals. I would never have taken this if I had known the weight gain or that it can be hard to come off.

"I'm sitting here looking at this new script for Cymbalta (duloxetine dr) 30 mgs. and terrified to take it because I've been taking Mirt. for over 20 years at doses between 15 & 30 mgs (15 for sleep & 30 for depression). I have no problem when I occasionally drop from 30 to 15 but I've been on 30 mg the longest time.  Doc said start Duloxetine and we will then begin Mirt. withdrawl within a week.  I'm afraid.  From reading here, it appears Mirt withdrawal can be long with a lot of undesirable side effects.  I don't want to second quess my doc but I just don't think I should start the new med until the Mirt is almost cleared from my system.  Any thots, suggestions, comments. welcome.  Thanx

I havent changed my eating habits much at all, in the first few weeks I ate more but once I noticed the weight gain I started eating only healthy foods and small quanitites but it hasnt shifted the weight just slowed the gain down.
I am seeking help as to how people have come off the medication, and what effect it has had on their weight. Did it come off easily? How long did it take to lose the weight etc...?

"Ok. So I have been on Mirtazapine for 20 months. When I first started at the 15mg dose, in a month I gained a stone. Then dieted and lost it. I have never had a problem losing weight over the years by eating a healthy diet. Usually losing 2 stone in 3 months, Now on 30mg of mirtazapine, was on 45mg but had unusual highs so it got reduced. Since September 2012 I have gone from 10 stone to 14 stone 9 and I have dieted in between with not much luck. I dieted for 4 months and lost 4 pounds and I was eating so healthily and almost suffering. Due to being a victim of crime 6 weeks ago I come off the diet due to stress.I cannot control the hunger and cravings. i binge to the extreme between 10pm and 2am, I even eat in my sleep.
What worries me though is even on a diet I cannot lose the weight. And as I say, in the past I have lost weight when eating healthily no problem.
My doctor wants to start reducing my mirtazapine in January as I am on too much medication. I am worried about coming off it as I have gone through anti depressant withdrawal before, actually paroxetine withdrawal is the reason why I am on mirtazapine, Plus for my height and now weight I am obese so that is the other reason he wants to take me off it,
I just wondered if anyone has had weight gain and if they have lost it when they stopped mirtazapine?

"I'm quitting Mirtazapine 45mg.  I've decided to suddenly stop (not recommended) . I'm aware that you can always feel worse than you can imagine despite saying ' I couldn't feel any worse' if that makes sense. mentally ill is bad, mentally ill and chemically ill may prove fatal.? Confused and scared to be honest.The NHS has failed me big time. 'professionals' have forgotton appointments, compounded my misery and left me feeling more desperate and isolated. My mental health has spiralled downhill to the point that I'm considering sending my Victorian father and mini-him sister a letter from my GP listing my past six months med records. I just wouldn't cope at my sisters wedding . My sister and father are in denial,ignorant (bliss)or just mentally lucky. My father's auto reply to any news of my physical or mental illnesses has always been ;' Probably drugs'  but would be devastated to read my problems( he's been paralised in hospital for nine months with an auto immune condition called CIDP) but will be furious if I don't attend .I'm having panic attacks when I'm going up to London to see him and just can't face it now. How do I solve this dilemma? They look down their noses at me at the best of times.  If you had asked me last year, 'Glyn,would you like to go into a mental home for a week,I would have said no way . Now I would say yes please.That even shocks me to write/read that. I'd love to be with like minded ,mentally ill people to at least relate to and ,to be honest,compare myself to. After pleading for help for a year I was finally offered group therapy in a place I can't get to. The closest I got to telling someone my problems was a face to face Personal Independence Payment assesment last week,no advice or feedback,just them trying to trip me up and find a reason to axe my benefits. I've gone from being a heavy cannabis self medicator to just one before bed. No side effects,drowsiness etc. I sleep like a baby but have had to stop the recreational abuse of it to give myself a chance to improve my MH. I've lost all confidence in the broken NHS,primary,secondary care teams,GPs and I'm going to go swimming every day ,use not abuse cannabis ( in my medicine cabinet not on my coffee table now) and improve my diet . I have B12 injections for pernicious anaemia through neglecting my dietry requirements and now eat lots of fruit and veg,less sugar and salt and hope I'll start absorbing vitamins and folic acid naturally. 
Crikey , nobody said it was easy. Anyone have any advice or help to get my life back please let me know. I'm not sure my Mirtazapine,Lofepramine and Diazepam meds are the way forward.

"Can anyone relate, could this be withdrawal? I started withdrawing 3 weeks ago and I've gone from 15mg to 14mg in that time. The last 2 days I've felt so weak especially in my legs, a heavy agitated nausea in my stomach and woozy wobbly head so I feel almost dizzy walking. I keep panicking walking just around my house and need to lie down and rest which is hard with 3 children to cook and care for.
I just showered and I'm lying down exhausted. I do have chronic fatigue issues the last 18 months but this feels different to my normal fatigue and ill feelings I have. I just wondered if it could be mirt? Yesterday was terrible, I couldn't walk all day as I felt so weak, dizzy and faint. Stronger than my usual crashes I have with my chronic fatigue issues. I couldn't cook for my family and had to lie down most of the day which made me feel useless. I had severe anxiety all day which I do if I crash with my chronic fatigue but the anxiety was pretty strong to the point of panic when I walked around. Not nice at all. I think I'd be reassured if I knew mirt withdrawal can feel physically like this. Can anyone relate?

"Hello! Adjusting doses between 3.75 to 30 mg didn't seem to give me any mayor adverse reactions, but going from 3.75 to 0 makes my life to a living hell for a while... Some time ago I regularly took 15 mg which I then tapered down to 0. After the initial complete terror I felt like crap for a few months.
I was Mirt free for a year but eventually got problems falling asleep. I found the solution to my sleep problems was eating tiny crumbs of Mirt. About 0.5-2 mg made me really tired and gave me a good nights sleep, it was crystal clear; eat a tiny crumb - sleep well, eat no crumb - hard to fall asleep.
Eventually the sedating effect of these low doses ceased and I have been trying to quit this TINY dose of Mirt multiple times but that just makes me feel like crap. Is there anyone else who is this super sensitive??
And then to my last question. I've been having these intense hungers at night time lately which I also have experienced periodically in the past and I believe Mirt might cause this... I eat okay during the day and take my Mirt at about 9-10 PM, but then often at 11-12 PM I get so hungry i can't sleep. I just eat anything I can come across and it's really hard to cease my hunger. And as if this wasn't enough, I can only sleep for 6 hours and then I wake up and have to rush to the kitchen for food. Note that this only happens periodically over periods of weeks and when it does, I only get these cravings night/morgning. Sometimes hunger is paired with light anxiety, but I don't know ""which one is the chicken and which one is the egg"". Anyone with a similar experience?
Thanks!

"Last friday i stepped on a rusty screw while in the park. The screw had stuck to the bottom of my shoe, and then when i stepped down, it lightly punctured the heel of my foot (not deep). When i took the screw out to examine it, it was quite rusty. I didnt think much about until 2 days later when i started feeling a strange/uncomfortable sensation on the left side of my neck (particularly when swallowing). I had gone to an amusement park the day after the screw occurance, so i just assumed it was minor whip-lash from the roller coasters. Then the next day, i realized that i could not remember the last time i had my tetanus shot. It was definitely more than 10 years ago, so i checked myself into the ER. I then talked to a doctor who examined my foot (the puncture had already healed since it was a very small puncture) and she told me ""I am from the Phillipines and i know what tetanus looks like. If you had gotten tatanus on friday and today is monday, you would most definitely already be seeing severe symptoms (paralysis, very big difficulty breathing, death etc...). I can tell you that you do not have tetanus."" They then proceeded to give me a Tbap shot (tetanus shot) that lasts 5 years.
I was relieved to hear this, however, here is the problem: i read online that the incubation period for tetanus can range from 2 days to 2 months. And i was at the ER yesterday when she told me this, and im noticing that my jaw is getting a little bit tighter. Perhaps its because i have been opening my mouth really wide a bunch to make sure im not getting lock-jaw, but it could also be because i possible really do have tetanus.
Should i be really concerned here? Was that doctor being too presumptuous? I mean the way she diagnosed me was not exactly precise, it was more based on speculation. 
If the would was basically a very small puncture, does that still mean i should still really worry? 
Thanks for you answers in advance.

Just wanted to give some positives.  I decided to stop taking Mirtazapine 45mg on Saturday due to some really bad thoughts and thinking that I just cant carry on like I was.  Anyway I feel great, normal again and like my brain is my own again and I know that coming off this drug is a bit hit and miss for a lot of people but I can honestly say I've not felt better for months.  I'm still on venlafaxine and beta blockers so I've got something in my system to help with the depression and anxiety but planning to get off them asap too. I feel like I've been poisoned and maybe I just had a adverse effect to this drug.  I've had no side effects from withdrawal as yet so hears hoping.

"Hi all,
I have been trying to come off mirtazapine for over a year now, since march 2016. It has been extremely difficult but slowly and surely I have been getting closer and closer.
I have tried to stop about 3 times but always with disastrous results. All of which means, that I have had to reduce to a much smaller and smaller amount before I stop.
You would think that the lower the dose the easier it becomes but for me, the lower I go the more the withdrawl symptoms seem to hit me.
Normally if i can get through the first two weeks then it gets easier. However I am in the 4th week of 0.17mg and i have felt completely awful. The first three weeks were ok. So I am extremely confused.
Has this happened to anyone else? If so what advice would you give?
I am just hanging in there hoping it will get better/easier but day by day it isn't.
Any ideas, advice would be most welcome.

"Hi, first time poster but I really wondered if someone could analyse this for me.
im taking fluoxetine and mirtazapine together. i took as a result of severe OCD plus insomnia and mild depression\\anxiety. With the help of CBT i am extremely fortunate (and grateful) the OCD and insomnia are no longer issues and i hope never will be. the mood side of things though remains.
as a result of this, i was given mirtazapine (first 15mg, now 30mg) and i just don't know if it's doing anything. I feel flat 99% of the time. i don't enjoy things i used to enjoy. simple pleasures such as watching a film, seeing friends etc, don't hold appeal to me like they used to. i feel neither highs nor serious lows (of course no-one wants the latter, but in this respect i feel like i 'can't' become emotional) i was told a potential side effect of mirtazapine is the fact it can infact make you feel 'numb' and this is what i'm feeling at present. recently, i've also been thinking highly negative thoughts about life- how miserable i'll be when im older, what happens after death, etc etc (but i stress no suicidal thoughts), what's the point in things such as love, happiness etc- depressing thoughts,no?
despite all this, if you'd have said to me a year ago i'd have no OCD\\insomnia i'd have bitten your hand off, it was such a large part of my life. but now the next battle is this: i want to enjoy things again like i used to, and to look forward to things. i'm not sure if the mirtazapine or even the fluoxetine now is helping (would i actually feel continously depressed without it) or hindering (is it just cutting off any positive emotions)
sorry for the rant, but any advice\\input would be greatly appreiciated. thanks.

"I was prescribed 15 mlg one a day at night mirtazipine roughly 2 weeks ago. The first week the only side effects were odd dreams and increased appetite. No big deal.
The next week on the meds however were not so fun. I have had a headache that is more pressure feeling than spike pain for a solid 7 days. Also, specifically my arms have felt very shaky. I do not feel weak really, just when doing precise tasks like writing or cooking I notice my hands and arms shake. This feeling has been strictly in my arms. Finally, on day 15 i began having occasional diarrhea, but not nausea, noirregular heart beat and amazingly no breathing issues more than i may have due to my asthma. I also have woken up 3 days in a row shaking all over. It feels like a panic attack but without any thoughts in my mind good or bad and also it passes quickly.
Has anybody had any of these side effects? Are they related to the meds at all? Will they pass? And info at all helps.

I've been prescribed 7.5mg of Mirtazapine, which worked for the first week but now is not working at all and it's honestly really disheartening. I don't know what other medication I can try to help with sleep, and my GP has said Mirtazapine is more effective for sleep in lower doses.
There have been times where I've taken Zopiclone (up to 3 x 7.5mg) with my Mirtazapine dose, including propranolol (40mg) with still no sleep inducing effects. I've tried mixing cocodamol with it too, as they normally make me slightly more tired than usual, with still no sleep inducing effects. I've taken over 100mg Promethazine/Phenergen on separate occasions with still no affect. I've tried all natural sleep aids from Boots and Holland and Barrett etc as well. I've even tried diazepam which honestly does nothing, and I understand that mixing anymore of these medications will be more of a risk than a benefit.

"Hello,
I am on Cipralex 10 mg and off mirtazapine since 7 weeks (15mg during one year for sleep).
I tapered down from 15mg to 7.5mg (5 weeks) and gradually with 1.875mg steps towards 0mg, each step lasting 10 days.
I had a very hard time coming down from 15mg to 7.5mg, anxiety, stress vulnerability, mood swings-irritability appetite loss and insomnia but things stabilized after 5 weeks.
The other smaller steps were less difficult.
After and since last dose, except a few days, I feel miserable mostly in the morning. The stress vulnerability is the only thing that has really improved. Anxiety is more physical than mind related. The irritability or general dissatisfaction mood swing is also less extreme. Insomnia has gotten worse and worse starting week 3 after last dose. It is very difficult to fall asleep and whenever I sleep it is a light interrupted sleep that is difficult to maintain. I sometimes take 0.5mg xanax with delayed action but doesn't help a lot. As soon as I wake up, usually quite early, I often feel overwhelmed by tensions in my body (arms, throat chest, gut ... etc ...) and get up in a miserable state. I found that cardio exercise is the best to feel better but finding the time and motivation is not easy during the week. 
I have the feeling that my brain isn't producing melatonin but instead too much cortisol.
I was expecting things to go better after 7 weeks. I have read about the wave and window patterns of withdrawal healing. Last week I may have had a few window's days and I am probably in a wave these last 2 days.
The hard thing is to know if this WD will have an end and when.
If someone recognize himself in this situation and/of likes to share his experience, this would be really much appreciated. 
Thanks, Nico

"I was on mirtazapine for a year and half, 30mg for my depression and anxiety aswell as sleeping problems. They were a big help and I felt like they suited me other than making me feel like I was in my own world most of the time. I recently found out I was pregnant and my doctor said nothing about coming off them or them not being safe until my second appointment with her, she took me off them completely and asked me not to take any more what so ever, I agreed but I have had the worst 3 weeks off my life since, she has replaced them with fluoxetine because I can't manage my depression on my own. But I'm shaky, hot then cold, sick every time I eat and have extreme nausea which is not due to the pregnancy because I had none of this before, I can't sleep longer than an hour or two most nights and my anxiety is really bad. Can someone please give me an estimate for how much longer I'm gonna have to feel like this? I know everyone's different but I'm so poorly and can't eat which is not good for my unborn baby. She told me because I'm pregnant I should be fine and that there was no withdrawal symptoms from medication like this, I've heard going cold turkey is quicker for getting it out your system but I just wanted some advice? Sorry for the long post.

For treating depression - it seems to be really effective though. Does anyone have any positive stories to balance the negative ones? Re the weight gain - if I'm careful about what I eat, I should be ok , right? Or is it metabolic?

"After speaking to my GP today he wants me after 4 years to start weaning down off Mirtazapine as we both agree it's causing me worsening fatigue and it's bad enough with my thyroid. 
I am only on 15mg, I have been on that dose for just over 3 years and I started on 7.5mg 8 months prior to that. He said to just break it in half and take 7,5mg. I explained that I've read and been told it's a VERY hard drug to wean off from and tht dropping to half the dose will cause me serious withdrawals which I cannot cope with, having a chronic illness on top it won't be good for me. He said it's fine and hes' never had anyone find it hard to wean off Mirtazapine. I asked for liquid and he said I didn't need to wean off it with liquid slowly.
He said to just drop to 7,5mg for now and see how I feel for a few months. As I have SADS he said next year we will then drop from 7.5mg to 0 slowly.
Mirtazapine has been a helpful drug. I was attacked 5 years ago and I was an anxious wreck, PTSD, agoraphobic etc.. but then since my ill health a year ago it's not helped at all when all the anxiety and agoraphobia returned. Yes it still helps me sleep and eat but other than that I feel no real benefit and I am sure it's actually adding to my faitgue and lack of motivation. I want off all medication but of course to do this very slowly.
Any advice appreciated please as I don't want to just drop to 7,5mg over night and he won't give me the liquid to do it very slowly.
Thank you
Ju

"I was on Mrtazapine for 6 months and then started tapering with lots of ups and downs. It took 2 years because of many devastating family issues in between. I was down to 0.2 ml and i was doing really well and thinking of stopping. During this time i contracted bronchitis and allergice asthma. Doctors put me on antibiotics, and then on Prednisone 20 mg for 5 days tapered down to 10 days because i could'nt breathe. I wish i had never taken it. Now my insomnia and resulting anxiety and depression are back in full swing. I have raised the mirt again and taking Lorazepam 1mg on top of it for anxiety. Doctor said it is one of the side effects of Prednisone and gave me another AD and i refused. I wanted something herbal and now I have started taking St. John's Wort 900mg. It will take a couple of weeks to take effect, meanwhile i am struggling with insomnia and co. and not able to to go to work. So if you already have problems with insomnia, please be careful with taking corticosteroids. They are life savers for many but at the same time come with very undesirable side effects.

"I have been on Mirtazapine for almost 9 years.  But nervousness, anxiety, it only got worse... So definitely want to get off.
I know I have to taper slowly and it will take a year.
But the WD I expect from beginning is insomnia .
My thought was , as Mirtazapine is sleep inducing because it is has histamine H1 receptor affinity… maybe taking a bit Benadryl to avoid the  “not sleeping” WD could make it easier to me.
Of course not full Benadryl tablets and not for to long, maybe just a few days, at every drop down.
( Even if only placebo ) .
FB groups say it should be avoided , but no more info.
Any thoughts ?? Anybody tried it ??  Thanks

The withdrawals started,  nausea and headache. I want to make the liquid form from the tablets as my GP doesn't prescribe SolTab.  Couldn't cope with the side effects so I took 7.5mg last night.   If I want to taper down,  do I have to stay on the 7.5mg for a bit,  to get it back into my system,  or could I start tapering now with the 10% method?

"Mirtazapine appeared to 'poop out' on me around 3 years into my therapy with it. I had been diagnosed with severe depression before going on it I scored almost the maximum on the test. My symptoms were nervousness, jumpiness, anxiety, severe depression, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, itching, migraine, heart palpitations and IBS. The GP tried me on several antidepressants, none of which worked until I tried mirtazapine and it was just amazing. I felt better within days. All of my symptoms disappeared. It was a miracle drug which gave me my life back. Then when it suddenly pooped out my symptoms all came back and I was also diagnosed with chronic kidney disease stage 3. I decided to come off it and tapered off really gradually with very few WD symptoms. I had a period of feeling good again and then wham! All my symptoms returned. I thought I had delayed WD but something in me told me it was a physical illness.
Long story short, we have a new GP and he's sharp as a pin. Did many tests on me and I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. My sympptoms have become gradually worse and I am pretty ill right now, especially with heart related symptoms. I have been put on carbimazole and propranolol.
The purpose of this post is to urge all of you with depression to get your thyroid checked. It can be very dangerous if it is left untreated and is very often misdiagnosed as depression because it shares most of the same symptoms. Both under and overactive thyroid cause depression. Drugs such as mirtazapine can mask the symptoms. I reckon mirt masked my hyperthyroidism until it became so severe that it just couldn't mask it anymore. That's why it appeared to poop out after working so well for so long.

"Hi together.
Yesterday it was my 6th night on 7.5mg of Mirtazapine (instead of 15mg). Moreover I could not take my dose on Saturday since my wife was celebrating her birthday so I had a few bottles of beer and did not want to combine it with med. What I experience so far is maybe slightly worse sleeping (really slightly worse). In this thread I would like to post my progress of withdrawal since I know many of people here go or would like to go through it as well and such threads would be very helpful for me.
My questions now:
1) did anybody experience really heavy back pain + shoulder pain + weakness in arms and palms (fingers) - all the time while on Mirtazapine?
2) did anybody experience huge volume of stool every day - all the time while on Mirtazapine?

"Hello! Me again. I copied this from another post on a different website,"" One last thing…it seems as if the side effects can seem to have cleared up, only to reappear later…the good news…each time they appear they are weaker."" This is where I am after 8 weeks. Still having anxiety, abdominal cramps/pain, interrupted sleep, nausea, weak, headaches, vivid dreams, and fatigue. Did I miss anything? However, all of these are slowly getting better, Like the quote says, I think they are gone, only to have them return, but less severe. That alone creats it's own form of anxiety if you are not expecting it or aware that it happens. Again, this was cold turkey off 7.5. This has been, for the most part, a horrible experience. The sad thing is that I was on 45 mg for over 7 years, and suffered side effects the entire time, and didn't realize that it was the Remeron. It was prescribed by a psychiatrist, who left town, and my general MD said that he would continue the prescription. All those years I was telling him how bad I felt, particularly in the morning when I first woke up, and felt better in the evening, but it never registered that it was side effects from the Remeron. I don't blame him, particularly when the psychiatrists don't seem to be all that informed about what this drug is capable of. I hope that this has been helpful to at least one person. I think that it is helping me to write it. Thanks VERY much for all the replys, feedback, and suggestions while I have been, and still are fighting this. Regards, David

"Hi all,
I've been taking 15mg Mitazapine for a year now.
I was originally perscribed it for a low period where I was struggling to sleep.
Overall it been fantastic, helped my anaxity, broke my sleep problems and gave me a real boost.
However, the last couple of months I've been feeling less and less awake during the days and more fuzzy headed, which is stopping me getting out and doing things. I've had 9 hours of sleep and it's mid day and I feel like I want to curl up and lie down.
I'm not sure if I should try increasing my dose to 30mg - so it has less of a sedation effect?
Or try halving it to 7.5mg, to try and slowly come off it?
I can't get an appointment with my doctor for another 4 weeks.
Thanks.

Going from 7.5mg up to 45mg,  and then back down, Finishing off at 7.5mg without any side effects at all.  Last night I cut the 7.5mg in half and woke up with nausea and a headache.  It was worse than being on a high dose of 45mg.  Should I just stick to the 7.5mg and take it on alternative nights,  every two,  then every three and so on.  Has anyone tapered off in this way?

"Hi, I've been on mirtzapine for over 2 years now and its not helped my depression or anxiety, and most of all... my sleep. The doctor made out like it was a godly drug at the time and it would make me sleep. Well its not worked and I've been constantly returning to the doctors, trying sleep hygiene and everything you could possibly think of, but its not helped my sleeping. The only time I feel truly asleep is when I get ridiculously drunk and pass out. I know this is bad, but I get so exhausted throughout the week that getting drunk and passing out feels like the only ""real"" sleep I get. I truly feel at my best with a hangover, ""but at least I've managed to sleep!"" is what I think to myself...
Don't get me wrong, whilst I was on the Mirtazapine the initial falling to sleep was a matter of when my head touched the pillow. I fell asleep instantly. Yet I woke up within hours and I'd find myself waking up all night, going to the toilet and only really getting light/unrestful sleep. 
I know everyone dreams, but I literally remember about 4 dreams a night. They are so vivid. I can wake up, go to the toilet and go straight back into the same dream. Its like my brain never shuts off! So then I finally get up in the morning feeling extremely unrested. I have sore baggy eyes, no energy whatsoever and I just spend my day in self pity.

"Hi All
I had the sinus surgery and I was suffering from head pressure for 4 years. It started affecting my sleep and my doctor prescribed me antidepressants. I started feeling well. I tapered the medicines and could not sleep for a month. As a result, I went back on antidepressants escitalopram (10 mg), klonopin (0.5mg) and mirtazapine (7.5 mg) in may 2015. Last year I tapered off escitalopram and klonopin completely. This year I reduced the mirtazapine dosage from 7.5 to 3.75 mg and life has been hell since then. My doctor advised me to take 11.25 mg for a while but it isn't helping either. My head pressure has returned. I can't sleep for more than 4 hours. Can't concentrate on my work. It has already been 2 months I didn't sleep properly. Decreased amount of sleep is causing anxiety and I m unable to enjoy my life.
I want to start taking another drugs along with mirtazapine and taper them out. Then I want to continue on 7.5mg mirtazapine for rest of my life. I m just 26. What do you guys think?

"Hey folks where do I begin.. Been checking out the forum the past few months while I've been trying to get off this awful little tablet.
Basically suffered anixty from a young age now 32. Started getting ocd negative thoughts over a year ago. It scared been at first it was all my worst fears playing tricks with me. So docs put me on mirtazapine as i really don't like taking any meds, I take the odd pain killer but other than that I try not to take anything. I especially didn't want to take AD. But with pressure from folk around me and docs recommend advice they suggested it was best I try mirtazapine as I suffer from anxiety disorder. It was causing me to not want to go out to certain places etc.. Anyway its been over a year now and by far the worst of my life. I only started on 15mg as it blew my hair off, litterly couldn't function and ended up bed bound due to feeling so all over. Anyway after a couple of weeks it eased and I started getting out more and felt more positive maybe it's placebo Effect, no idea it's all just been a blur. I suffer from a vertigo( balance disorder) it pops up now and again so I know sometimes I have to rest, but it's the worst thing when your an over thinker. Anyway I've been back and forth to the docs and getting no where, some say up the mirtazapine some say they think am best off not being on Ad. I'm currently waiting for my Cbt. I've tried since Dec to reduce off these awful tablets as I'm convinced they are not doing anything other than making me crave foods at night and sleep qnd have weird dreams. I wake up feeling so hung iver

"Hi I have been on mirtazapine for 6 years and had a few blips over the years.
my gp has put me on to 45mg from 30 mg, just feel so low at the moment and having the most horrendous night sweats, just wondered if anyone else has had this as a symptom of stress and anxiety. Don't know if there is something else underlying, and this is making me feel worse.

"On Sunday mornings at 10.30 I organise a French convesation group. Saturday night I took my mirtazapine at half past midnight.
At the group I found that I hardly recall the words that I wanted to say. As an example I wanted to think of the word for yesterday - hier. I always have a problem remembering that - I know it is either hier or demain (tomorrow) but if I can't think of the two words in the first place I can't juggle them. When you tell me the word, I know it.
Of course, conversation requires the instant use of words, In English, we can think of alternative or simpler words for the same thing but if one can't think of the basic word it is very difficult. Effectively one is left saying one can't think of the word.
I note on https://patient.info/medicine/mirtazapine-for-depression-zispin-soltab that it effectively says that ""Mirtazapine may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert"".
Precisely!
And http://www.drugs.com/sfx/mirtazapine-side-effects.html
Effectively ""effects common with psychiatric medications (e.g. constipation, confusion, loss of coordination, memory loss)"".
When I have important meetings I don't take it the night before.
Last night I dropped off to sleep and woke up at 2.30 and therefore didn't take it.)(

"Hi I have been on murtazapine for 2 weeks 15mg. I am desperate to come off it as it has made my weight go up a bit, and having suffered with an eating disorder the anxiety from this side effect simply isn't worth it for me. My two questions:
1) do you think I'd have withdrawal effects if I go cold turkey given the short time and small dose?
2) for anyone who stopped taking it, after how many days did the weight you'd gained start to drop again?
I know I should wait to ask the doctor but I can't get an appt for weeks and really don't feel I can stay on these

Besides insomnia what are some issues that people have dealt with while weening down off of this crap, I'd appreciate any info as I'm really determined to get off this all together and Mirtazapine is my final hurdle and I definitely won't go back to anything else anymore as they've all made things worse for me with the exception of sleep.

"Hi there
I am on day 12 of Mirtazapine 15mgs ive had all the common usual suspect side effects
weight gain, increased appetite, dizziness. drowsiness, dry mouth, consipation, very strange dreams and increased urination.
Went from sleeping 13 hours back to reguakr 7 hours now, out for the count. I always take my tablet at 10pm. The last two nights, after taking the tablet ive had a sensation of my throat tightening and finding it uncomfortable to swallow water.  Has anyone else had that and during the day a weird sensation of being on  a wave or on a rocky boat?
Havent driven for 11 days so thought i'd give it a go only down the road to the supermarket. My first outing on my own since taking the meds. I was ok driving , But once I got out the car and went to get a shopping trolley I felt weird.
I continued into the supermarket selecting my purchases, but I felt strange, my legs felt like jelly, my head was in a state of dizzyness. I felt ok in mind apart from tension in my right shoulder, this was bothering me abit. People around me shopping didnt alarm me. I continued shopping down the aisles buying along the way, talking to myside in my mind,, Saying to myself no panic, no panic, making sure I was  taking steps to breath normally  all around my shopping trip. 
I managed to even self seve and pack my self at the checkouts, but I was still in a weird bubble of numbness and feeling lightheaded and no weight in my legs. Anyone else had similar feelings or experiences on the early days of taking  Mirtazapine.
I must add I am taking Mirtazapine for anxiety and I have counselling set up to work along the medication.
I was on Mirtazapine 4 years ago for 5 years for fepression  But talking more openly with family and looking back at the family tree, it appears the condition anxiety and depreesion runs through my mums blood line. So medication , exercise, a healthy diet, and counselling seems to be the postitive continous way forward. To be able to sustain a good quality of life. As the last 4 yeras off the medication have been long, painful unhapp and  at times a very lonely journey.
I know each one has different degrees, levels and types of the various side effects, but it be helpful to hear from anyone who is on the same dosage as me and around day 12 or remembers how the early days were for them
The mirtazapine has lifted my mood and i feel more focused in my mind, I do actually feel happier within myself already just need to knock the side effects on the head as I am keen to get back to work.
feel free to share your experiences and any, advice thanks for listening.

"Hi,
I really hope someone out there can help.I was prescribed mirtazapine in november 2015 due to a complete breakdown. By March 2016 I had made some changes in my life and decided I wanted to come off. I was not sure what to do but did what I thought was ok and took roughly 4-6 weeks and came off. Unfortnately I had spectacular withdrawal symptoms so reinstated and decided, from advice on this and other forums, to do a much slower taper. Last week I eventually came off again, following a 30% reduction every 4 weeks. I had got down to 0.35mg, which I thought was a more than conservatively low amount at which to stop. Unfortunately yet again I have had some terrible withdrawl symptoms.  Everything was ok till day 6. I am really loathed to re-instate but don't know what to do? Any advice would be greatly received.
Also would any-one recommend getting some other drug from the doc to help come off. Or is that a bad idea?
Thanks

"Hi all, new poster.
I'm in a terrible state. I was out on Mirtazapine this time last year for 'anxiety' and 'depression'. What I was actually going through was acute benzo withdrawal, for which I believe it us virtually useless, but that's irrelevant now: I've been in Mirtazapine at 45mg for nearly a year.
I want to come off this drug because I don't think it is doing me any good. My psychiatrist set me a tapering schedule which was one week 45 / 30 day about, then week two 45 one day, 30 two days, then supposedly onto 2 weeks at 30. I thought I was getting away with virtually no symptoms until halfway through week 2 I starteed to get 'head rushes' and anxiety...the first episode was only a couple of hours but he next day it was four hours, and by Sunday night I just had to go back up to 45mg. The anxiety bordering on own if I was experiencing was just unmanageable.
How long will it take for me to stabilise again? (I was totally stable on 45). TBH honest I'm resigned to just taking it again for good, I simply cannot face another long period of bad WD.

"Just wondering if anyone can shed any light on this. I was taking Fluoxetine combined with MIrtazapine and was diagnosed with Serotonin Syndrome. So a few months ago I stopped the Fluoxetine (30 or 40mg) altogether. Now I'm on Mirtazapine (plus Lyrica,Valium,Seroquel,Metoprolol) and have reduced my Mirtazapine from 45 to 30mg. Even since then I keep getting these awful feelings of agitation, can't walk properly, get very mentally confused etc.. Even though I'm not changing my medications, I'm actually getting worse. So I have to come off the Mirtazapine and fortunately have a couple of psychiatrists appointments coming up... Everyone i see just tells me I have anxiety... I can't eat food thats hot otherwise my temperature shoots up, I have migraines that last for hours, go figure.. all the doctors tell me I can't possibly have serotonin syndrome since I'm only taking 30 Mirtazapine and no other serotoninergenic agent.. Not asking for anyone to give me a diagnosis but just wondering if anyone else has had serotonin syndrome or neuro-malignant syndrome on Mirtazapine alone ?

"Hi
I see my psych on tues and don t know what to do.
I have severe pnd and am on 45mg of mirtazapine, have been for 8 months. Also 150mg if venlaflaxine and diazepam.
I think the mirt helps me sleep but I feel like death every morning. In a fog heavy head. I get tension headaches some days and feel out of it. I know it is not the diazepam as on a low dose early eve and have taken it on and off for years. I ve only been on the venlaflaxine for 7 weeks and think it is helping but the mirt side effects may be making it harder.
The psych will want to put the venlaflaxine up to 225 but I think I should reduce the mirt. I am not sure it is the mirt doing this but it is the obvious culprit. I know I will have to reduce slowely but I just want rid of it. I think I ve been more anxious on it.
Any advice or experience ? Have people found mirt causes a hangover or increased anxiety ? Tapering advice ? I know 10 % every 3 to 4 weeks so it will take at least 7 or 8 months to get 15. Also worried as more sedating at lower doses but I'm sure I was not this bad on 15mg.

I gradually reduced to 7.5mg since June last year and stopped altogether 3 weeks ago. First couple days felt fine but then started throwing up (dr gave me Metroclopramide), not eating and not sleeping. Feeling rubbish all the time and no energy. Can anyone help with how to get over this. I had a bad night last night and have nearly succumbed to going back to mirt. Spoke to dr, not helpful, he suggested I go back on mirt or start Citalopram!! I asked him about herbal remedies and he's against it favouring prx drugs. I am reading a book on natural highs and it recommends 5-http which I've tried but that keeps me awake and Kalms which seem to take edge off feeling anxious but no sleep. I have to have b12 injections (due 1 today) hopefully that will make me feel better!!! Sorry I have gone on a bit. I would b very grateful for any advice. The shaking is really bad and embarrassing

"I've recently come off of Clonazepam at 1.0 mg and it's been 3 weeks today. All I can say if anyone is thinking about a benzodiazepine medication please dont do it because it's a living hell to come off of! That being said it has really opened my eyes to the dangers that some of these medications pose to us physically.
I'm currently on 22.5 of Mirtazapine which I had down to 15 mg but my doctor wanted me to go back up when I came off Clonazepam, I also take 25 mg of Seroquel that he also added to help with sleep. I'm really tired of all the medications period because I've never felt this awful physically my whole life. I've seen people post about Mirtazapine being more sedating at lower doses but wanted to ask people who were on higher doses and came down if that is the case or not.
The medications I'm taking are basically just sleeping pills for me at this point and I really want to get off them even though I'm not going to rush tapering off like I did with Clonazepam. My main fear right now is my insomnia coming back but I think if I can get through coming off Clonazepam I can make it through anything. Any feedback would be appreciated as I know that this is what I need to do to get where I need to be but I'm not sure how to get there.

"[size=18:bc23d4e2e7][color=darkred:bc23d4e2e7]Hi there. If, like me, you are taking Mirtazapine (30mgs) you too will be hoping to find someone else who is experiencing some very odd side affects!
A little about me: I've been taking one a day (at night because they are - for me - a sedative) for nearly 7 months now since a rather large 'crash and burn' session in the control room at work.:cry:
To start with the tablets knocked me sideways. I felt as though I was talking and being talked to through a series of double glazed windows. Very odd, disjointed and well .... spaced out quite frankly. After about 8-10 weeks this calmed down and I was beginning to get my reality back a bit. I was told by my GP that these tablets do, infact, forcably slow you down. They certainly did that! It was all that I could do to get dressed in the morning, preferring just to sit infront of dribble on the TV. Sadly, with a 6-year old and a husband who does shift work, I CANT afford to slow down to this extent. I would say that, in my experience so far, the first 4-5 months were a bit of a blur.
I am now pulling out of the lethergy, only to have THE most amazing electric noise in my head every 20 minutes or so. Its so very hard to explain, but the best way I guess is; those plasma balls you see that when you touch them, the electric gravitates towards your hands - well, its THAT noise but in the part of your head which you cant explain! God, I really do sound quite mad don't I! It only lasts for about 2 seconds, but its enough to make me wince as though expecting a big firework to go off!
All the way along my appetite has increased - now upto 13 stone - but to hell with that, Ill deal with that when the inside of my head is better. :wink:

My husband tells me that I am generally very calm now - I have no highs and no lows (and I miss both of those) but I have also lost my spirit, my drive, my fight which makes me who I am.
Happy days are ahead or atleast that's what I'm told.
Happy to hear from anyone who is taking these tablets .... especially from those who have similar experiences. Its a big world out there and I feel quite alone in my mine. xx[/color:bc23d4e2e7][/size:bc23d4e2e7]

"Hello,
I wondered if anyone could resssure me on the sleep front. I was on mirt 15 for about a year and tapered down to a 1/4 tab. I was so fed up with the side effects even at such a low dose (back pain, headaches, depressing weight gain) i decided to stop. I was ok for a few days and just used 1/2 a sleeping tab here and there to help me through but by about withdrawAl day 6 it's got really bad, i feel physically exhausted but unable to relax enough to sleep. And now worrying about sleep is making me very anxious. I'm taking sleeping pills most nights and even they don't work particularly well. Feel like i've lost my ability to drop off. Regret the day i ever started those tabs. Can anyone help? thank you.

"Hi I'm looking for some advice on this subject too please. I have been on 15mg of mirtazapine for about 6 weeks. I have recently been to the doctors regarding stool issues and an ache in my back passage. But since Christmas I have had such bad lower back pain. It's Worse in the morning, or if I sit in one position too long. I did a stupid thing and Googled my symptoms, and of course it came back bowel cancer. So now I am worrying out of my mind. I read on the list of side effects for mirtazapine that back pain is common, however I can't find many reports of this.
Also for probably the last week i have been feeling constantly tired, like really drained. It feels like I have lead weights on my arms and legs, everything is I an effort. Which really is unlike me, I'm normally very outgoing and bubbly but I have completely withdrawn into myself. Up until Christmas I was going to the gym 4 times a week but just can't face it at the moment with the back pain and feeling like this.
I guess what I'm asking is, can mirtazapine cause this sort of pain in my lower back, or am I right in worrying about the possibility of colon cancer? I know you cant give me a definitive answer because I suffer with severe health anxiety hence being put on mirtazapine in the first place, which I guess is sadly ironic...

"Hi, I've been taking 15mg for about 6-8 weeks. Doctor recently changed the dose to 30mg but I'm cutting them in half so still only taking 15mg. I have noticed improvements I've only had a couple of bad anxiety attacks since starting them when before I was having a couple a week. My appetite has improved slightly and I have gained a couple of pounds which is good for me, I need to gain weight. If I start to take the 30mg will I get side effects again? I didn't suffer too bad just tiredness and a few headaches would I get those again?

"Hello
I don't usually post on any forum but I am going through what many of you are going through. I could use a little support and would like to give some as well if I can. I have been on Mirtazapine 30mg for 8 months and as a result have gained more than 40 lbs. I've had enough. The weight gain has caused me more problems than the depression did. So about 3 weeks ago I cut myself down to 15mg mirtazapine per day. As a result I have suffered some anxiety (manageable), moderate to severe body aches (which is complicated by the fact that I already suffer from severe chronic pain due to 8 bulging discs in my spine that I take 6 medications in an effort to control including 2 narcotic pain medications), the first week I had insomnia but now I find myself sleeping almost around the clock which I find to be a Godsend (it beats the heck out of suffering constantly). On Friday I plan to stop taking Mertazapine altogether. Cold Turkey. If you would like I will let you know how I'm making out and I would very much like to know how you've made out.
Thank you in advance for your reply and I wish you all great success in your endeavor to stop taking this horrible medication.
P.S. Please be very careful as stopping this medication too abruptly can cause life threatening effects. If you begin to feel too badly either physically or mentally please, please, please call your doctor immediately or go to the nearest hospital for help. Nobody wants you to be a dead hero!

"Please forgive me if I type too much, I just don't want to forget anything that someone might find helpful.
In 1996, my closest childhood friend killed himself, then a few months later my dad was diagnosed with a brain tumor and he died within a month, in a hospice bed, in our dining room. A few months later I found out my girlfriend of 3 years was messing around with another guy, and that's when I felt the anxiety switch turn on. I physically felt something change in my and it felt like I had been punched. The feeling never went away, and just got worse, and in no time at all I had my first panic attack while driving on a busy freeway in Chicago. I began to get tunnel vision and my hearing became muffled and I thought I was going to lose consciousness, and my friend in the passenger seat had to take the wheel and drive us off to an exit ramp. It was terrifying. 
So I went to see the family doctor I had known since I was a child, and he diagnosed me with GAD and PTSD, putting me on Paxil right away. Paxil made me even worse for the first two weeks or so. I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to eat, I would grind my teeth like I was on speed, and my emotions were all over the place. It finally stopped and I felt better, but Paxil's side effects were awful, the worst being no orgasms. For nearly two years, orgasms were impossible. It was depressing. Long story short, I left my old doctor for insisting on getting me on Paxil, and then Ativan, which I became addicted to. He insisted I stop taking Paxil without a taper, so I felt like I was going insane. I started having panic attacks every single day, which is when he put me on Ativan and told me to take as needed, so that's exactly what I did, because he never told me it was addictive. (I just trusted my doctors back then.) 
I found a new doctor who helped me immediately. He weaned me off Ativan with a longer-lasting benzo, diazepam, to make it easier to taper. It still took me nearly an entire year. That was hellish. I hadn't slept well in months, and the new doctor told me that the first night I took mirtazapine I would sleep like a baby, and I remember saying, Sure buddy you're crazy. But he was right. Mirtazapine started working on my anxiety the very first day. (Unlike SSRIs which take WEEKS.)
So since I've gone through all that, I wasn't as frightened to quit mirtazapine. Plus I'd done a lot of research on respected websites, not AD forums or anything, because those are usually full of people that go on and on about how the drug they're currently on is awful and ""the devil"" and they can't believe it's not banned, etc. When in fact, some drugs work for some people, others, not so much. You have to try different ones until you find a good match.
I think some of these forums do more harm than good: they're filled with people that are hurting and have nobody else to turn to, so they unload all of their problems, suspicions, fears and junk science, which scares the newer members and makes them worry that THEY'RE going to have a hard time starting or quitting a med. When you have anxiety, at least when I do, your expect the worst possible outcome, and you worry about everything. And that worry and pessimism feeds on itself and makes the anxiety worse and more difficult to treat. So I think it's important to take a lot of what people complain about with a grain of salt. That doesn't mean these people are not being truthful, but just because that was THEIR experience that doesn't mean it's going to be YOUR experience, too.
I was always unmotivated and tired on mirtazapine. I slept well and it really helped my anxiety, but I never wanted to do anything, and most of the time mirtazapine caused intense brain fog so I couldn't think clearly. It affected my work and my relationships with friends and family. When I stopped taking it last week, I immediately had a rush of energy that I hadn't experienced in years. That brought some anxiety too, but I was determined to get through it, and I'm so glad I kept going. This is a huge step for me because I really didn't think I could do it, but I had to try. I was sick of the brain fog and weight gain and lack of energy so I had to see if my condition would improve off the meds.
So of course I would recommend stopping it cold turkey and just getting it over with, instead of dragging it on and on and being miserable for months. I would not suggest this with benzos or SSRIs, Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic and it affects your brain's receptors differently, so it's not as big of a shock to your system when you stop taking it. Don't get me wrong, it made me feel some de-realization, where you feel really weird like everything is not quite real, but probably only 15% of the intensity that I felt when tapering benzos. And I've been nervous, and the brain fog comes and goes, but overall I have more energy and the aches and pains are beginning to subside.
So now, all I'm really feeling is a general sense of feeling ""off"", just slightly weird, along with almost-constant, low-grade anxiety, but that improves every day. I haven't had taken any mirtazapine in 7 days, now, and I feel good. I'm currently completely med-free.
I take 150mg of Suntheanine L-theanine on an empty stomach in the morning, which calms more morning anxiety. I’ve cut out all caffeine and vitamins, because both just make my anxiety worse. I take 400mg of magnesium glycinate about two hours before bed, with food. I then take 1-2mg of melatonin about an hour before bed. L-theanine calms the brain without making you tired. It REALLY helps. Magnesium calms me and makes me a little tired, so that's better around bedtime. I usually have a glass or two of red wine in the evenings, which calms my mind a bit as well. (It’s so nice to be able to enjoy wine without feeling exhausted and foggy after the first few sips, like it did when I was on mirtazapine!)
Hope this helps and sorry this was so long guys!

"Hi,
I was on citalopram for 4 years with no issues. I weened off in August and was fine until November time when I was struck with the most awful depression, anxiety and insomnia.
I went straight back on the citalopram but despite increasing to 40mg over 4 weeks it had no effect.
I was then put on sertraline 50mg 4 weeks ago but again this has had no effect.
Sleep is a massive issue and despite taking zopiderm every night I am hardly getting any sleep and what I am getting is not quality sleep so I'm feeling dreadful.
The physiatrist has changed my medication today to mirtazapine. I'm absolutely perfect about another medication change and the side effects this may bring. Also very scared of feeling out of it the next day.
Would really appreciate hearing any experience of this medication.
Thanks

"I eventually realised after years of battling with low mood to go on mood stabilisers I chose Mitrazapine iin part for assistance in helping sleep as I dont sleeo too well. So I started taking 15mg on 20th December wanted to allow Christmas time as a time to allow myself to get used to then without them interupting my job. Anyway my mood evened a bit and I wasnt sleeping after a talk with my GP who said if I wasnt sleeping then they werent working I went up to 30mg. I tried 22.5 for  a week but when the7 15mg ran out I went up to 30 which I have been on now for a few weeks, But the last few days I have felt really low trigerred by an event that is a trigger (ill health and not getting to the gym and losing bulk, as I get depressed due to body issues) These last two days I have felt suicidal and really low.

Ok so i have done what the doctor suggested and come completly off mirt (was on roughly 8mg give or take)
I needed this out of my system completly as the side effects were debilitating to the point i have been off work. The feeling of disasociation and constant stomch pain and broken anxious to the point of being scary sleep. Rougly been on them a year no higher than 15mg.. the doctor wants to try something else but wont start me on it till ive had a washout....anyway back to why im writing this
My last tablet was friday 13th (in hindsight what a bad day to start!!!)
First couple of days not too bad apart from sleep and anxiety but for the last 2 days i have had the most awful sleep where i fall asleep fine but wake up at 4am in a terrible anxious state and nausea is awful. I know these are withdrawl but i am having the most horrific migraines.. is this normal. Also did anyone else take diazepam while coming off. I was given 2mg tabs but due to being super sensitivei cut one in half but even then i felt very sick the next day. I do have migraines normally but usually its to do with monthly cycle but these are awful and even my triptan med isnt helping. Any advice? I do not want to reinstate mirt as this is my 2nd and last time i am withdrawing

"I am considering a slow taper. I am on 15mg, very afraid after almost 4 years to withdraw and this forum has frightened me I must admit lol!
I am ill with an underactive thyroid and chronic fatigue but I feel the mirt is adding to it. I feel sedated all day, I never felt it this bad until a year ago so it could all be related to my thyroid. I just have noticed my mornings I feel so dizzy eyed, weak, foggy head and heavy eyes. I have this worse on some days but every day I have those symptoms until around 11am or till after lunch. I am sure that's mirt even if it is worse in the last year. I have chornic fatigue due to my health conditions but my concern is mirt adds to it. The first 2 years were fine, I ran, did yoga, worked out, and had bags of energy but after 2 years my thyroid failed and I had chronic fatigue. I just worry with how bad the mornings are it has to be mirt related.
I have also not found losing weight easy even though I needed to gain weight. I also have high cholesterol since on them. I have found they helped me through a traumatic time, I found them very helpful as I have felt so much calmer on them. I was attacked 4 years ago by my brother and had to walk away from my mother and sisters who made mylife hell for not forgiving him. It was a horrific couple of years and mirt did give me some peace, I felt much calmer so I do think that on them I am a calmer, more content person. I used to be quite short tempered and stressed but on them I am so calm and chilled, my children would get away with murder haha. So I do worry coming off them I'd go back to feeling that high anxiety, not sleeping or eating and short tempered but maybe the short temper and not sleeping was all due to the severe anxiety and trauma i was going through. Maybe I am now just so drugged up I am unable to be anything but laid back ;-) Yet I do still have anxiety and low mood, and my agoraphobia has returned in the last year due to the chronic fatigue and dizziness, it has all made me lose my confidence. 
Every day I drive myself mad worrying mirt has caused the fatigue, my high cholesterol yet I am scared to wean off incase i have a bad experience and I go back to severe anxiety, insomnia etc... There is only one way to find out and I can't stay on them forever can I. I may be wrong and it's just my health issues causing my fatigue and weakness.
My GP won't prescribe liquid, I am currently on the 15mg Activis tablet. Has anyone used milligram scales and weighed them out to withdraw? any advice? I want to do a slow taper as advised here by Calmer.
Thank you

"Hi all. I've been taking mirtazepine 15mg for 3 weeks. I spent the 1st week taking just half a tablet so only 7.5mg. I'm taking to help with anxiety/insomnia/poor appetite due to constant nausea.
I'm taking it before bed and getting to sleep within around half an hour but I just don't stay asleep! I constantly wake throughout the night then finding it hard to get out of bed when it's time to get up. Then when I do get up I have a slight headache feel a bit dizzy and queasy.
I'm back at the doctors later this week for my first review. Does anyone know if increasing to 30mg will help me sleep better? I've seen reports that it's more sedating at lower doses. It's seems to be helping with the anxiety and I am eating a bit better. It's just the sleep that's the problem

"I've been on mirt since may 2013 after I was attacked by my brother and suffered severe anxiety and agoraphobia. I took 7.5mg for may to December, it helped me sleep and eat again. By December the anxiety hit harder so I increased to 15mg and have been at that dose since.
I'm considering weaning off. I'm tired all day every day, literally like a zombie. I'm exhausted all day which has got worse in the last year with an underactive thyroid on top. I'm also developing more and more phobias since being on it to the point I'm scared to have blood tests, go to appointments, can't socialise.... yes it could be part of the anxiety but feel it's been slightly worse since on 15mg. Also I get some odd thoughts since on 15mg but I've stayed on it because it's helped with my mood. I became very low after what happened and mirtazapine helped me feel calmer. I do believe it still helps me stay calmer and I feel content (which worries me coming off) but my situation isnt what it was 4 yesrs ago. I cut my violent brother and toxic family members out and life is much better. I am so exhausted, brain fog, much needed weight gain but now cant lose any and have a low level general anxiety since on them but I thought the fact I could sleep, eat and feel overall calm and content was worth the other annoying side effects. I planned to stay on it but I need to know if it's causing this chronic fatigue and also I feel off balance a lot. I also need to know if it's adding to all these phobias I've developed. I literally am so needy and need my husband to support me doing anything outside of the house.
I'm not saying mirt is all bad, it's not as it helped me get my life back on track and I do worry right now is it the right time as I'm coping with a chronic illness, having some extended family issues with my mother as she cut me off after I cut my brother off for attacking me yet l still have to see her so my children have a grandmother. So I do wonder if I should throw withdrawal into the mix but I've considered withdrawing for a while due to this chronic fatigue that's only been severe the last 16 months and I've been on this over 3 years so maybe it's not connected. I was always tired on mirt but it's more severe the last 16 months which could all just be linked to my thyroid.
Any positive withdrawal stories or advice on how to do it? My gp doesn't want me to withdraw right now but it isn't helping with my current severe anxiety and I've been low. The last year I've had severe anxiety due to how unwell I've been physically and due to how fatigued and poorly i felt i became house bound again when i had overcame the anxiety and agoraphobia in 2014. Mirt hasn't helped and I don't want to increase to 30mg. So I was wondering if anyone could share how they withdrew and any positive experiences as they interest is full of frightening withdrawal from mirt stories which is another reason I've stayed on it so long just through fear of weaning off but I can't stay on them forever. I want to be stronger than my anxiety and do this.
Thank you

I first had depression in 2009 it hit me out of the blue. 2 year before i left the father of my 3 boys who were 6 7 and 10. I mived in with my parents for 2 years before getting a house. This is when the depression started probably situational through realising i had to raise my children alone and deal with bills for the first time in my life. I ended up with really bad chronic fatigue on top of this and was in a bad place but had brilliant support from my mum. After a few differnt ads found an old trycilic worked for me and after 2 years i felt in a better place and managed to get myself a part time job which i am still employed at.
In dec 2014 my mum took unwell suddenly and by march she was dead. We never made it to the hospital in time and were not prepared for being told she was gone.
I felt i was coping well got through the funeral and carried on with life work etc and in july i had 2 weeks off. On the last day of my holiday it was my sons 18th birthday and almost as suddenly as the first time i had a breakdown all the feelings of wanting to die were back again. I was signed off work and my ads were increased but by november i was really really bad hadnt eaten for 3 weeks felt really suicidal and ast my sister to call for the doctor. She decided that i needed to be put on mirtazapine 15mg so i was to slowly come off my old one along with taking the mirtazapine. It really was a miracle drug in that almost the next day i was able to eat again. I managed back to work in january last year but i always felt very dizzy and really disatatched from reality. I wnet up as far as 30mg but that dose made me have panic attacks so settled on 22.5mg but still having dizzy spells doctors said to stick at 15mg. I did this but was staring to have awful stomach issues as o have severe ibs so the doctor decided to see if the mirtazipine was the cause to come off them. I went down to 7.5mg for a couple of weeks and then just came off like she advised and the plan was to then try me bad on my old ad. This was in july. The first couple of weeks i felt a little better apart from this niglling stomach issues but by 3 weeks i was taken to hospital in horrendous pain and dehydrated. I spent a week in with all sorts of tests scans but they couldnt find anything other than severe ibs so was sent home in the same paiin as i went in. Several visits from doctor even trying different ads all of which i was super sensitive to a last resort o was put back on 15mg of the mirt this was august but my stomach issues are as bad as beforw again and i have severe pins and needles which come 5am in the morning im delerious. Every morning i feel like im in all i can describe as someone elses body. I feel like im a robot. I feel nothing. All i have is pain anxiety. Im a recluse the pain and anxiety have made me scared to leave the house. I honestly feel like i do not want to live with this feelings anymore. I have no quality of life. I exist thats it. I sit in the house all day either in pain or going through the motions. I feel in my gut that the mirtazapine is the cause of all this because around 5 to 6 hours after taking it thats when i feel the worst i awaken with the horrible tonglimg all over and racing horrible thoughts of being and feeling nothing are all thats in my mind. I get up and everything i do is robotic. The doctor wanted to add trazodone but i did a drug interaction and it said major. I dont want to be sedated anymore by adding this. Im so at a loss i just dont feel anything anymore and all thats in my mind is i cant go on like this anymore. Ive been off work again now since october and feel ill never be fit enough to go back. I have no money and get no sick pay as dont earn enough so existing on tax credits. I feel like a failure and a nusiance. I feel like the doctors are sick of me.
Im so sorry for the long rant but i really dont know what to do anymore because i cant deal with the pain and the feeling im no longer me anymore

"Sorry to post again, I did before Christmas.
Long story short, 3 years ago I was put on Mirtazapine as i was struggling with insomnia after the loss of my nan and my brother had a break down and attacked me which led to severe anxiety and post traumatic stress. I lost my mother and sisters as i refused to forgive him, so I lost all my family in a short space of time. I became anxious and agoraphobic. After 6 months my GP prescribed Mirtazapine in May 2013. I didn't want to take it but was desperate. I agreed and took 7.5mg until December. Then my sister got in touch hurling abuse at me for not forgiving my brother, my anxiety rocketed so GP said to go up to the 15mg. I did and felt a little better. I was sleeping and able to eat again so it felt worth staying on the mirt. 
One thing I noticed was I was having odd thoughts, what if I hurt myself or my family, odd thoughts I'd never had before, I saw my GP and he said that was the high anxiety and over time they did calm down but I always worried it was due to Mirtazapine. I never had suicidal thoughts as such more fears of what if i died etc.. I also developed phobias and social phobia, blood test phobia became a big issue for me. Things I'd never feared before. I was again told all to do with my anxiety disorder. Mirt continued to help me eat and sleep, and my husband said I was so much more relaxed.
August 2015 after 2 years on Mirt I started feeling fatigued, thyroid was borderline underactive so just told they'd monitor it every 6 months. November 2015 my son became crippled by panic attacks and felt suicidal due to severe bullying, my daughter was rushed into hospital ill and suddenly my fatigue worsened which my GP said was due to shock and stress. I had to help my son as the mental health team wouldn't offer support other than a waiting list for therapy. It was a horrific 3 months and during that time my fatigue became so bad I couldn't walk and was bed ridden. My GP came out to see me, ran a lot of blood tests and said it was stress and again another trauma. 
I never recovered from that time, my son went on to be well, my daughter was fine but all of last year was difficult. I had energy crashes if i over did housework, went out for the day or a simple trip to the shops, I'd end up so fatigued my legs would go weak and I'd have to rest in bed the next day. My GP diagnosed chronic fatigue. In January, March and May of last year my thyroid was tested and my TSH shot up from 6 in January to 9 by May, then I was put on thyroxine. My TSH is now 2.6 and much better yet I am still unwell. 
My GP ran a lot of blood tests in November and nothing flagged up, all very good and he tested almost anything he could. I am told my fatigue is due to chronic fatigue and an underactive thyroid. For a year I have struggled with fatigue that i have to pace myself, my agoraphobia returned which had gone after a year of therapy after my brother attacked me. My anxiety returned too this last year all due to how unwell I have felt. My husband has been amazing and supports me, lets me rest at night once he is home, he and my children have been an amazing support this last year. It's been hard for us all me being chronically ill. My husband takes the children to all the appointments they need and I feel I am letting them all down being so fatigued adn unwell. 
I did started to feel a little better once on the 50mg of thyroxine, my anxiety lessened, i was out walking my dog daily again and going to shops a few nights a week with hubby. I felt I was getting my life back then 3 weeks before Christmas I had an anxiety attack and I spiraled back into deep anxiety and with it felt some depression, my issue has usually been anxiety but depression can hit if my anxiety becomes severe. 
I knew it was back because Christmas is a tough time for me since what happened with my extended family as I know my mother and sisters will insist on visiting to see my children. All last year every birthday I'd be terrified having to have my mother and sisters visit but I tolerated it fo rmy children, my friends would say why do you allow them to visit if they cause you so much fear? but I would so the children saw their grandmother and cousins. Id' crash for days after seeing my mum, I'd be so weak and fatigued I'd feel ill. My GP said stress also caused my huge energy crashes and it still continues to. So Christmas I knew my anxiety was there due to having to see family. I was scared I'd see them and crash energy wise so close to Christmas.It caused me daily anxiety with fear of seeing them I made myself ill with anxiety and with that ever since CHristmas I have been struggling with fatigue again, weak thighs daily that won't ease and again back to easily crashing. Yesterday we went to the duck pond with our children and 1 small shop. I came home feeling tired, had a quick shower and then fatigue hit bad and today I feel weak and drained. So there goes my anxiety again worrying what's wrong with me, why at 37 am I like this, what if it's something been misssed etc...
I have now started to worry if Mirtazapine is causing this, my GP and husband say it wouldnt and I have chronic faitgue due to having post traumatic stress and a thyroid illness but I am struggling to accept it. I wanted to wean off Mirt but read some awful stories of withdrawing, nothing positive which has scared me I will be on this forever. I know my GP is right and right now while I adapt to having a chronic illness it's not a good time to withdraw. When I look back to how anxious and terrified I was after I was attacked and how severe my anxiety was I can see now I am relaxed and laid back. I still have some abnormal thoughts but they no longer scare me and they are just there out of habit from when I used to freak out for having them. I jsut worry it's caused my phobias etc but again i am told the agoraphobia, loss of confidence, social phobia etc has all come from having an anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress.
Am i doing right to stay on them? I am now a health weight (I was a painful 84lbs before Mirtazapine, almost all my adult life) I sleep so well but daily I feel so weak in my legs, tired all the time, dizzy head....like a zombie and it causes me anxiety attacks. I always worry it's made my health issues worse but it's so hard to know when you have stress, anxiety and an underactive thyroid. I feel confused about what to do for the best. I am coming through the latest anxiety setback after Christmas set me back so why am I putting myself under pressure to come off. I think it's because it's coming up to 4 years on them and I fear i should have stopped them by now and not been on them for such a long time.
Sorry to post again.
Thank you
Julie

"I stopped the Mirtazapine 9 days ago, I got down to 3.75mg then stopped. I started reducing last summer. I was experiencing a little sleep disturbance, on 3.75mg but manageable. Since stopping I can get off to sleep but wake after 4 hrs. Then sleep is difficult. I'm starting to feel the symptoms of sleep deprivation. When I try to relax in bed at night I sweat profusely. I'm too cold without the covers but too hot with them, even though it's the middle of winter, my hair is soaked in sweat. I've got a cold this week so some symptoms could be attributed to this. But I wonder are these withdrawal symptoms or am I going cold turkey, or is this a sign I need to stay on them a bit later. I really want to stop them because of my weight gain. I want to persevere, I have no depressive symptoms. This in itself is a joy after all the anxiety I had. But sleep deprivation was the start of my depression many yrs ago.
Any advice welcome.

"HI all. Struggled with mirt, going onto it. Took me about a month and it was not easy. While it may have given me a little benefit, after almost 5 months on it its safe to say the drug does not entirely agree with me. Often feel like i have a dead horse on top of me, very heavy feeling, almost like a weakness. 
If i have understood, the smaller the doses, the more it sedates. I was thinking to start weaning off and half the 7,5mg for say a good 3-4 weeks and then stop from there. 
My concern is that i have a 10 day trip coming up to Thailand in about 14 days time. As i am living quite a stable life now am a little concerned if weaning now could cause me some problems, side effects etc. 
I realize my 7,5mg is rather small dose, but surely weaning off will have consequences. Nice to hear from anyone with experiences. Many thanks!

"Hi guys,
I quit Mirtazapine four weeks ago after a relatively slow taper. Not 10% every four weeks, but still, pretty slow. I feel better now, and sleep seems to come around as well. The past weeks have been rough and I am still not sure I won't have a setback, but right now I feel good and let's hope it stays this way. So far so good. My only question is regarding my weight and I am curious if anyone has an answer. I gained 3,5 kg (almost a stone) in weight. I remember two friends that took the same med also gained, but later shed the weight without any effort. But I am still 3,5 kg above my normal weight. Curious if anyone has any insights.

"We all need straight talking answers to deal with this and put it away,
Thank you all.
Writing in forums because we don't know what's going on has made me so mad.
I'm a single parent,solely responsible for two wonderful young professionals.
The Mirt W-D caused me worry,
It's W/D are so physical,you want to go back to being just fed up,
The Mirtazipine made me feel unwell Nothing prepares you for what can happen.
I'm 41,female,healthy,not taking any meds
I had a shock bereavement at 32 and depression, my depression went 5months after getting clean and sober,Mirtazipine was for help with sleep...Urrrg... biggest mistake ever
I only took the Mirt for 10weeks,the first three weeks sporadically,it took a further 10 weeks to be myself.
My advice is Never take this drug,try every other avenue first.
I have one more thing to add,
Don't smoke Cannabis with Mirt W/D
My heart was beating out my chest,the Anxiety will stay with me forever.
Your not going mad
I did cold turkey and don't recommend It.
Good luck,
The W/D do go!

"Hi, I'd been on 30mg/day mirtazapine for about four months before I decided to stop because it was making me so drowsy (although doing wonders for my depression). I tapered down to 15mg/day for a week as per my psychiatrist's advice, and then stopped taking it at all. I was fine on 15mg, but now I literally can't fall asleep without chemical help. It's been about a week. I'd been using diphenhydramine, which worked for a few days but obviously built a tolerance, and now I'm trying Nytol herbal tablets - the pharmacist said I couldn't use any other antihistamines because I'm also on 200mg/day sertraline, and have been for about a year. I was wondering how long this insomnia is likely to last, and if there are any other sleep remedies I could try. I've been given diazepam in the past to help me sleep, but I can't see my GP to get another prescription for two weeks. I'd be really grateful for any advice or information; I'm building up quite a sleep debt and I don't really know what to do. Thank you!

"Hi guys,
?I have been writing on this forum for some time and I have been tapering from 7,5 mg since the end of June. The end of July I went to 3,75 mg and every time i had soms bad nights after a little less than two weeks. The end of September I started taking 3,75 every other day and had soms bad nights aswell. End of Oktober went to 1,875 every other day and quit everything on 14th of November. I'm almost three weeks post now, and feel relatively good, but my sleeping is still very light and I have trouble falling asleep. Also I have muscle tightness and tension. Ringing in my ears too, but this is probably the muscle tension.
?I am curious if anyone can comment on this, is this last stap (quiting) harder than all the tapering before? And when should I consider going back on a tiny dose? i really want to see it through, but I also don't want to be irresponsible. Last night I had to take a Xanax to sleep because 03:00 o' clock I was still not sleeping.
?Any help is welcome. Thanx.

"This is, I think, my fourth and deeoest fall into the dreaded land of depression. I swore the last time would be the last time, now I see I have been kidding myself on.
Mirt worked wonders for me last time round so it was an easy decision to accept this treatment now, 15mg starting tonight, 30mg in two weeks time.
They want me to talk to someone, take some sort of non-chemical therapy somewhere down the line. That's just not me.

"I was put on mirtazapine in May 2013 after I was attacked by my brother a few months before. I was low, anxious and agoraphobic. I was desperate. I couldn't eat and didn't sleep for 6 months. I weighed around 6 stone and felt ill. I am so against meds but gave in and took them but I said I'd only take 7.5mg. It helped, I felt calmer because I could finally sleep. I worked on the agoraphobia, I slept and ate well. I gained a stone and felt really well. Then at the end of 2013 my family got intouch causing me intense fear and anxiety and I was forced to attend my mums wedding. My anxiety got too much for me having to see my brother there and I started feeling full of anxiety and intrusive thoughts. My GP suggested increasing to 15mg. I agreed so in December 2013 I increased. I have been on 15mg since.
I have always worried mirt didn't help me that much since being on the 15mg but I am much calmer and although I still have anxiety and agoraphobia on and off life is calmer and I cope better if family get intouch. I sleep so well and I love food. So in some ways I can see mirtazapine has helped. I'm now 8 stone and healthy bmi, I was so thin and frail before. I never slept and was an anxious wreck.
I became ill last summer with chronic fatigue and I was sure mirtazapine was a big reason, I feel tired all the time no matter what time I take it the night before, i suffer from unreality feelings and zombie feeling every day. My GP said it sounded like CFS and I have now been diagnosed with an underactive thyroid. I have been very unwell with the thyroid but i have wondered if mirt was a big fatigue cause. I'm taking thyroxine now for my thyroid and feeling much better up the fatigue issues carry on which I'm told is due to my general anxiety issues and thyroid causes fatigue. I didn't have crippling fatigue until last year so I've been told mirt is unlikely to be the cause.
In the last month I've had a setback with my anxiety. I go through stages of well periods where I feel much better and I'm out and about again then wham a setback hits. Usually if my family get in touch and I have to see them I get very stressed and anxious. The last year brought back my anxiety strong as I was so ill physically wjd bed bound a lot that I developed agoraphobia and social anxiety again too. It's been a huge shock and a tough year having health issues and a return in my anxiety. My anxiety in the last month hit hard and it has been quite physical which is unusual for me but put it down to Christmas and me wanting it perfect. I get anxious every December.
I sat talking to hubby about mirtazapine. After 3 years should u wean off. I'm on 15mg. Surely that's a long time and I should come off it and it's not helping me right now through this setback or this tough year should I be off it? My husband says he can see my point but when you think how bad I was 4 years ago he thinks it's helped me. I see his point completely as there was a time he couldn't work as I'd need him home and I was traumatised and anxious all day. Yes I'm in a setback now but it's not on the scale it was 4 years back. So yes mirt has helped in some ways but I also wonder was my brother attacking me enough to cause anxiety every single day since. I have agoraphobia which I work on, I could do appointments again etc then I got ill and wham I'm starting again on the exposures but I do get out each day, not alone but I'm working on it. I've social anxiety where I can't socialise at all since being poorly this year all linked in with the agoraphobia, and general anxiety. I had worked hard on the agoraphobia and social anxiety and overcame it a lot until last year when my health issues began and it all returned.
So right now I'm worried do I start to wean off or like my hubby thinks now isn't the right time and as he says there's no need to. I just worry it causes my general anxiety as I've had it daily since being on mirt; but yes I did have it daily before but since mirt I seemed to develop fears of everywhere and everything and I've not had 1 day off from it. Maybe I'm looking to blame mirt as that's easier but it's a worry I have hanging over me as I've not had 1 day off anxiety in a few years even when I've gone through better periods. I am in a setback right now with my anxiety, so maybe it's not the right time to wean off when I am already struggling with anxiety because I've heard withdrawal is hell and having anxiety moiety especially about health since being unwell it terrifies me.
I know I shouldn't put pressure on myself to come off it. I'm 37 and have plenty of time to wean off and right now why make my life harder but I worry it causes a lot of my fatigue and general anxiety. I never had anxiety this bad until the last few years. It used to be just health anxiety here and there but since I was attacked and put on mirt it became general all day and the added phobias which ok started before the mirt hence why I went on it but the general anxiety seems to be worse and daily. I have 3 kids and I plod on doing my best for them but get upset often I let them down having anxiety and now health issues. I can't due to health and agoraphobia do big days out, meals or cinema. All I could do again until I became ill last winter with the thyroid. I'm working on it again but get so fatigued still at times which then causes my anxiety. Since being ill this year my hubby takes them to any appointments and I feel I let them down. I still take care of them, take them to school, we go on holiday every summer an hour away... I beat myself up far too much.
Sorry this is one big ramble. I feel unsure what to do and I'm thinking right now is a silly time to even consider weaning off it.

"Hi
I have tried to come off Mirtazepinre many times using different methods, the best Method seems to be the slow taper. The problem is the jump off point I can last about 7 days and feel good and sleep ok but around the 5- 7th day no sleep starts, I have to work to make a living like most, so not having sleep is so stressful, nothing I can take over the counter can help get me to sleep, like MERT, and of course the other drugs known as addictive, Lorazepam (BENZO) helps but Doctor very scared to prescribe, because of the addiction, Well what about the MERT? And just how addictive is not being able to come off the MERT, yes!!  It’s  not like Cocaine, morphine, METH, Heroin. BENZO addiction, it is another type of addiction that they don’t tell you when you start taking it, and that is because most GP’s don’t relly know much about it,  but what they read from the studies. It’s called the silent addiction drug, it’s the drug that is not addictive but can be if you are that person. Anyway,  on my next taper,  I was thinking about doing Cannabises since it is legal where I live and I have been reading about the different strains and there is one that is good for insomnia that I would like to keep handy for the sleepless nights  I know I am going to suffer through, anyone have any experience with this type of method?

"I started to feel a little brighter about 3 weeks after starting Mitrazapine (15mg) having completely weaned off Sertraline. At about week 5 I started Ropinirole 0.25 mg and now 0.5 mg for my restless legs and muscle tightness. Just after week 6 on Mertrazapine I started feeling very low again and this has continued for 5 days. Could this be the conbination of drugs or could it be that I need to increase my dose of Mertrazapine? I was so hoping I could keep on the lower dose but Zi can't be like this leading up to Christmas. Please has anyone else been on this combination of medication?

"Just wanted to tell everyone here that I'm sorry for posting so much lately and that I know all that I'm doing is looking for reassurance all the time and making my problems worse.
I guess I have what can only be described as an internet addiction to find a cure for my depression, anxiety and insomnia that has come from it. I've come to realize the only cure for myself is me and there isn't any magic cure to be found by looking on the internet.
I thank everyone who has given me info about Mirtazapine and I'll be glad to offer any help I can with my personal experiences but I won't be posting any longer looking for reassurance and making myself worse and freaked out all the time. Thanks again for everyone's help and understanding!

"It seems like most of the discussions about Mirtazapine are around people trying to get off of it and how that effects us during the withdrawal phase myself included as I've been down to 15 mg for a little over 3 weeks from a high dose of 45.
My question for everyone does anyone feel like they will stay on Mirtazapine for life and what are some of the positive and negative effects people have had.
Personally it has helped me sleep better and my anxiety has gone down but on the negative side I'm drowsier during the day and have swallowing issues and it effects my stomach and I also feel I've been much more reclusive while taking it.

"I was on 15 mg of Mirt for 1year. Helped with mood, anxiety and insomnia. It started not to work as well so decided to taper down.
I cut down in quaters over a 3 month period. (15mg-12mg (1 month) -7.5mg-(1month) 3.5mg (10days). Totally off tomorrow.
Trouble going to sleep was first withdrawal symptom and have used
L-Tryptophan for sleep. 500mg at bedtime and 500mg in middle of the night if I wake up.
Just started with headaches yesterday and today, couldn't firgure this out as I don't normally get headaches.

"Hi everyone.
I was on 15mg Mirtazapine for about 5 months because of my panic attacks.
I felt tired all the time so I stopped. I went from 15mg to 0mg in about a month.
The first 3 weeks were absolute hell.
After that I started to feel a little better but I still kept feeling extremely tired.
I'm clean for 7 weeks now and I still feel terrible. 
I sleep 10 hours a night and still wake up tired. I also feel drowsy which makes concentrating and doing things very hard.
Anxiety and depression are not there all the time but they come and go.
I read a lot about people suffering from insomnia when coming of 
Mirtazpine. I had that the first 3 weeks but that made place for this mental exhaustion.
When I'm in this state it's hard to imagine that this is all part of the withdrawal and it will pass.
That's why I'm looking for some reassurance.
Does anyone else recognize this? And do you maybe have tips to make all this a bit easier to handle?

"Hi, can anyone share their experiences of mirtazapine with me. I was prescribed 30mg daily 6 weeks ago due to severe depression and insomnia due to bereavement. I have gained around 10lbs which judging by other forums is common but I have a history of bulimia which in fairness my gp is unaware of but it's actually making me feel worse even though the deep depression has lifted. I can actually live with the weight gain and hopefully sort it out later. The thing is, in the last couple of weeks I've been stricken with debilitating muscle, bone and joint pain to the point where I can barely sleep, I lie on my shoulder and waken after 20 minutes, lie on my back and wake up with back pain etc. I can't even bear to walk on
My bare feet and before I could've walked on stones. Has anyone else had the same side effects? I can't get an appointment with my regular gp for three weeks and don't like discussing my problems with a locum. Should I go cold turkey or just try and ride it out. I'm a 34 year old female and otherwise in good health - I think! Any replies would be really, really appreciated.

What if I took a mirt 15mg just for one night to see if I would sleep for a whole night. or is this a stupid thing to do. Haven't lost the weight either, or the mood swings or binge eating. It would be nice to go to sleep and wake in the morning.

"I had a period of bad anxiety and depression a year ago and my GP suggested 15 mg of this to go with Citalopram. I have been back at work for 10  months and quite well for most of that time. I recently had to start two different tablets for something else and decided to stop the Mirtazapine because I thought I was on a low dose. First week, no problems. Second week is a nightmare. Incredibly bad depression and some anxiety. Did the research and realised why. Started the tablets again at a half dose for the last three days and back to see the doc tomorrow for advice. Anyone done the same thing or offering any advice would be good. I,ve struggled to get through work this week.

"Hi all. Been taking for sleep for the past 12 weeks. Initially started at 3.75mg and now at 1.75mg. Been working great so far even while tapering but in the past week I've had some alternating nights of 1-2 hours of sleep and starting to think the medicine is pooping out on me already. Those nights I am really trying to sleep but cant till early morning.
Have I built up a tolerance and is this a sign that I am starting to actually learn to sleep on my own even if it is just a little? Any thoughts on anybody else that has used it for sleep and found it lost it's effectiveness after awhile?
I am not planning to up the dose and the intent is to come off eventually. It just sucks that if it is losing it's effectivness, I still have a ways to go with this taper till I'm off. So I'll be taking it for nothing if that's the case.

i started to taper down to a 1/4 of a 15mcg tablet but still experienced aches and pains.
I wonder if taking mirtazapine over a long period makes you more prone to side effects, even on a much smaller dose?
Grateful for any thoughts on this. Feeling so rubbish a lot of the time!

"Hey calmer,
Im hoping you could help me?
Little bit about my story.
3 months ago was a fit healthy man (32) loving work and enjoying life. I have recently had a little baby girl (6 months old).
3 months ago I started to get panic attacks and racing thoughts when I tried to sleep.
I went to my GP he prescribed me sertraline, worst mistake of my life(lasted 8 days on them).
I then went back and he prescribed me Mirtazapine.
I took 7.5mg for 3 days then moved up to 15mg for roughly 2 weeks. On the second week I thought these ain't doing much for my anxiety and I stopped taking them. Big mistake!!! I've never been depressed, within a few days I was in a black hole, crying etc.
I made the choice to reinstate the 15mg dose for 2 weeks, went back to the GP because I still thought they wasn't doing much for my anxiety. He increased my dose to 30mg. I've now been at this dose for a week and I still don't feel right, I know people say stick at it for 4-6 weeks but I'm starting to believe the mirt is causing OCD type intrusive thoughts which I've never had before in my life.
I'm seeing a privets counsellor which i think is helping more than the tablets.
Basically I want of these tablets! Even though I've only been on them a short time i believe they are causing more problems than they are fixing.
Making me lazy, not wanting to leave the house, not wanting to drive, OCD intrusive thoughts, and can't work.
I just want to get it out my system, I've forgot what the real me felt like, I feel kinda numb?
I'm writing to you because you seem to have the knowledge and information to help me get of these.
How do I go about it?
Thank you in advance.

"Hello, my name is grant, I just want to tell the people who are on mirtazapine how I got off the drug and the fact that I am drug free and feeling myself again shows it can be done.
I had general anxiety for a good few years and never thought too much about it until I started getting panic attacks and kept having to go to hospital because I thought I was dying. Anybody that hasn't had panic attacks will not understand how they make you feel...and the worry of having another panic attack at an in opertune time would usually bring 1 on anyway. My life was literally turned upside down and I went on a roller coaster of different tablets and some of them made me feel very ill and I just got worse and worse. My doctor finally put me on mirtazapine and it definitely helped me for a few months. It then it seemed to stop working so I upped my dose and was eventually on the highest dose you could take. I put on nearly 2 stone and I felt like half the man I used to be... no emotion just feeling very flat and getting through each day was a struggle. I decided to have a go at coming off the drug only to become very ill and go back on them just a week later. COLD TURKEY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO OFF THESE TABLETS.i carried on taking the tablets as I didn't think I could cope without them for about a year and a half. My life was just going downhill and I felt lost and alone and sometimes asked myself if I really wanted to be alive!
I just thought to myself that before I went on these tablets I was fine and that I could be fine again if I could only come off them. So I tried again but this time slowly, I did it by just keep missing a tablet for 1 day for a week then 2 days then 3 and so on until I was just on 15 mg every 4 days. I won't lie because the withdrawal I was having was sometimes unbearable and I was so close to going back to my full dose, but I didn't and after the three week mark of having no tablet I finally started to feel just a bIt better... wow! There was light at the end of the tunnel! My emotions started coming back and I felt human again which made me determined to never go back on the tablets.the withdrawals I got were horrible l, I had the runs for at least 4 weeks and felt sick to my stomach, I was getting headaches loss of appatite severe anxiety spikes and quite a few panic attacks thrown in. I just kept telling myself that it was withdrawal and being positive was a big part of my recovery. I started going back to the gym and running when I had the time and eating healthy. I finally felt like the person I knew was still in there somewhere was back and I was enjoying the little things in life again. The biggest thing that helped my through was DEEP BREATHING whenever I felt an attack coming on, I could literally stop an attack coming on by controlling my breaths. Life is a wonderful thing if your brain will let it be, and now that I am off the drug I feel amazing. I just want to tell anybody that feels lost and scared and that this will be them for the rest of their lives that it is not the case, I didn't want to live at 1 point and now I feel on top of the world. Your mind is the most powerful tool at your disposal and if you think positive that's what the outcome will be!!!! We can get over anything if we put our minds to it .??

"I have been taking this horrible drug for over two years now, originally prescribed for depression.  It never occurred to me that some of the things happening to my body were related to Mirtazapine because they happened randomly over a period of time and I never read the ""side effects"" properly when I started taking them. I take a lot of pain killers for various other ailments (namely Oxycontine, Ibuprofen, co-codamol 30/500, plus statins, blood pressure tablets, water retention tablets and I am also type 2 diabetic.  Massive weight gain - over 20 kilos over 2 years.  NO appetite at all but cravings for sweet things and fruit - lots and lots of fruit.  Because of my disability (I have osteoarthritis of the spine) I cannot exercise much except for swimming - that is if I can get out of bed!!! I just CANNOT wake up until around 1:00pm - thank God I don't work any more (I'm
67 and retired).  My mood swings surprise me and I am almost impossible to live with.  I was taking one 15mg tablet before bed each night and I have decided to get off them without going to the doctor.  I am cutting out one tablet every other day, then two, then three etc. etc. until I finally stop them altogether. So far, so good, but its early days.  I also have tingling in the feet and hands (for which I have seen a neurologist), an all over body rash which sends me mad with the itching.  I also itch in places where there is no rash too.  My mouth is always dry and I get bad headaches from time to time.  I've seen so many consultants for my ailments and they have all come back negative.  I know now that it is Mirtazapine that is causing all this.I can't wait for the time to go by until I an off them completely, to see if all my ailments improve,  Wish me luck!!

"Hello all,
I am writing this post to provide the assurance I was seeking when starting my journey of mirtazapine withdrawal.  I'll first start with some background.  Since high school I had always had trouble sleeping.  This past year, as a senior in college, I finally saw a doctor regarding my insomnia.  I was started on 15mg mirtazapine, which seemed to have no effect.  My dosage was soon increased to 30mg to see if my insomnia would improve.  A few weeks after starting 30mg I started developing terrible anxiety/panic.  My doctor, thinking that there was no way the mirtazapine could be the cause, again increased my dose to 45mg.  Soon after starting this dosage i felt absolutely awful, experiencing constant anxiety, depersonalization, terrible depression etc. I had no idea what was happening to me.  
A few weeks later, after having been on the drug for about 4 months, I had a thought that maybe it was actually the meds causing my struggles.  After pleading my case with my psychiatrist, she finally agreed that I could possibly be right.  Assuming I would need to taper, I asked my doctor what type of taper schedule I should use, and she informed me that mirtazapine actually didnt require a schedule, and that I should just reduce by 15mg every week until I was off.  I took her advice, however lowered from 15 to 7.5mg instead of coming off.  All I can say is wow.  I did not even know the despair i experienced existed until I started my taper.  Once Lowering down to 7.5 I felt unbelievable depression, feeling like their was a ton of bricks on my chest at all times. I also felt a long list of other symptoms, such as unbearable anxiety, depersonalization,  severe tension in my legs, weakness in my left arm,  shaking and night sweats.
These symptoms still linger today 3 months later, however have greatly reduced to a mostly tolerable level.  I've found that my recovery has come in waves, as I'll feel great for a week then feel terrible for a few days.  All I can say to those trying to come off this drug is that you need to be ready to commit.  There is no shame in reinstating if you feel the need, as it took me several attempts to get below 7.5mg before I was actually successful, but you need to know that once you get through the intial withdrawal symptoms will improve. I hope this post can help give someone the peace of mind I was seeking, and good luck to all attempting to taper.

"I have a 20 year old daughter that took Zoloft for about a year for anxiety. But she lost so much weight because of loss of appetite. She started to look unhealthy at 85 pounds from 120 pounds. Her doctor became concerned about her weight so he switched her to Mirtazapine 15mg. It has been two weeks now since she took her first pill and I've never seen her so angry. I have to coax her into going to school (college) every morning. When she gets there she is ok. By 4:00pm everyday, she becomes very irritated and anything can set her off into a full blown argument. She was never half this bad on Zoloft. Is this normal? Will these pills ever help?

Anyway, did anyone have these symptoms as a side effect of either taking or tapering?

"1st part of the saga is here if you are interested haha https://patient.info/forums/discuss/long-term-mirtazapine-use-taper-withdrawal-so-far-507675 ;
To Summarise,
On Mirtazapine for 9ish years, mainly 30mg and then 40mg. Tapered and stopped completely between january and April. Was ok for a month or so then quit a few other things whilst dealing with some bad personal stuff. Nosedived from there and i ended up reinstating at some point around June/July time at 7.5mg.
I Started tapering 3 weeks ago. My scales aren't 100% but i believe i took 6mg for 10 days and 5mg for ten days. Took a crumb of the stuff on Thursday and have had nothing since then.
 Effects so far have been Itching (constant if i think of it but bareable) Nausea, reduced appetite and reduced sleep (down from 7 hours to 4/5).  These started as soon as i started reducing the dose.
When i got to this dose the previous time i was having a lot of trouble with anxiety, and getting twitches in my eye lids and also what i read being refferred to on here as brain zaps, which were worse at night. Not had any of these at all this time except a little anxiety but nothing too troubling.
 Sorted out a lot of problems i had since i last attempted and now it is just this i've got to deal with so it should be a lot easier than last time.
 I lost 2 stone on the last attempt (I was slim when i started) and only put 1 back on. As long as im sleeping then this is the only thing i can see causing me a problem. I won't be able to lose 2 stone again!
 Other information that may be relevant
Im 27, male, not on any other prescription medication, smoker, and i've had a decent mood the past couple of months. No other illnesses either.

"This is my second time on Mirt.  The first time I was on 15mg then worked upto 45mg.  Then worked my way back down to 7.5mg.  When I got down to 7.5mg my GP told me to take it every other night,  then every three and so on.  I came off it no problem except for insomnia.  (Finished it about 3 months ago).  I then decided to go back on it,  (I don't know why.  This time only taking 7.5mg) as I couldn't sleep.  I have decided to come off it again as it is just making me more tired and feeling like a zombie first thing in the morning.  I don't want to go cold turkey. Is it best to do the same with the 7.5mg (every other night and so on)  or should I halve the 7.5mg.  When I asked my GP before about cutting the 7.5mg,  he said ""oh don't bother with that sort of thing"".  I just don't want to get any unwanted side effects.  I also take 150mg of Pregabalin.

"Hi,
I was on Sertraline for many years and weaned off them before starting Mirtazapine 15mg 13 days ago. I know it takes about 3 weeks to kick in properly. My question is has anyone experienced being angry whilst on these meds? I felt numb mostly on Sertraline so I think I am expressing repressed anger. However I don't like it. Could anyone advise me of their experiences re mood on this medication. (I came off Sertraline for other reasons).

"Ok well i have the doctors yet again tomoro morning and having been back on mirtazapine 15mg for 9 weeks now and feeling worse on them than ever before i think i need on something else. I feel emotionless unreal and very ill on them. My anxiety through the roof and feel depression taking hold again.
My only concern is what the hell they will put me on. I seem to be sensitive to drugs not just ads but strong painkillers too. Does anyone have any similar problems im on and off work and currently been off 2 weeks but how long they will put up with it i dont know and being a single mum cant afford it. But there is no way i can even get on a bus to even get there.
Anyway the most recent ad they tried but no sucess was sertraline only managed one dose within an hour of taking it i was away with the fairies and couldnt move.
Even my doctors dont know what to do. But i need something

"I have been told to ignore remeron as I withdrawal from benzos... been off benzos for 2 months.  I now realize that about 5 pm everyday I start getting brain zaps and head pulling feelings until I take my remeron 6.7mg at 9;30.  Which then those zaps go away.  Why in the world am I getting this?  Isn;t this a once a day pill?  Maybe you guys can help. My doc just always sais take more and so on.... I don't want to just take more.  I take this to sleep and want to get off eventually.... but I do have to stay on it for a while since I am in benzo W/D recovery..  the remeron is brutal that is for sure.  I am upset that I have to deal with such issues from this med while Im trying to recover from benzos.  Any info would be appreciated.

"Hi all,
My psychiatrist has prescribed me Mirt for sleep problems and I'm currently on Venlaflaxine.
A little about me... I'm 32 and mother of 5. I have been on AD since I was 16..
The last 12 months have been hell for me, my bad run started with a house fire right before Christmas, losing everything which I had a lot of help from my community but still was in emergency housing for 6 months and moved house 3 times.. around the time of the fire I had entered a relationship which drained me emotionally and was heartbreaking.
Upon receiving a lot of assistance from community, money was raised to help the kids and I get back on our feet, my sister had set up the fund but I only saw $1800 out of the $7500 that was raised. My sister had spent the rest.
Obviously this was very distressing and naturally my sister and I had a huge falling out, my mother was living with my sister at the time so she felt stuck in the middle and I could not get support from her, this led me to have a falling out with my mum.
I was alone... The only person I had was my mentally abusive partner/ex and his family, which were amazing and supportive... (My ex suffers from psychosis, autism, ADHD, depression etc...)
During all of this I lost my two eldest boys... Because of my ex.
My car was written off in an accident by my ex.
I became suicidal, ended up in hospital from an overdose. That was about 6 months ago..
Now i am no longer with him and I'm trying to patch up my relationship with my family and my two boys, after not seeing them for months.
I finally saw a psychiatrist and told him of symptoms I'm having.. Not sleeping well, no motivation, moodiness, feeling down all the time, anxiety, tired.
My 15 yr old son ended up in hospital after overdosing on medications and drinking.
He currently lives with my aunty and misses being home with me and his younger siblings. I was forced to move an hour away from where I lived as it was my only option of getting a permenant house to live in.
So at the moment I'm trying to piece my life back together. It's hard.. I don't feel suicidal anymore but I just feel like crap.
I'm worried about going on another addictive medication. I'm worried about side affects. I have been through so much lately and another set back such as messing with my meds could be disastrous for me.

"Started taking mirtazapine in June for insomnia, which it didn't help at all.  First month I took 15mg, second month 30mg and 3rd month 45mg now withdrawing from it with doctors knowledge.  Now into my first week of taking 15mg which I'm suppose to take for a month then take every other night for another month.  I have had CBT for my sleep and I'm sure now without the mirtazapine I would be sleeping wondered if anyone had withdrawn quicker when only taken them for a brief period.

"Hi all. First a bit of background. I have been on many anti-depressants in the last 4 years since a botched op left me in severe non stop daily chronic pain. I haven't adjusted at all well to being jobless/lifeless/in pain and generally watching my world die around me whilst I'm still here to watch it. I have PTSD surrounding the event and am severely depressed.
I decided to come off anti-depressants after reading a great deal of critical papers based on their success and upon who is actually funding/producing the research for their data. And yep. It's the profit making companies that make it?!?
My other main reason is (that for me) anti-depressants have caused me SO much more problems than not being on them. They have nearly killed me with regards to suicidal thoughts and intention so enough is enough.
As a final point my GP (NHS drug dealer) has absolutely no (and I mean zero) understanding of correct titration methods and if this is the person I am entrusting my health and life to then......well that's not great is it.
So, I titrated from 30mgs at 2mgs a week. I did this to try and avoid withdrawal, sadly even this didn't. I bought some micro scales on Amazon and simply cut the pills.
My last dose of 4mgs of mirtazapine was 28 days ago now. The first week-10 days was easy, no withdrawal at all, I congratulated myself on beating this drug then boom...... INSOMNIA, and I don't mean I don't sleep great, I mean I don't sleep, max is 1-3 hours. Nausea, headaches, vomiting, hot flushes that come on in a second. Suicidal thoughts non stop and agitation like you wouldn't believe. My chronic pain symptoms have also been massively exacerbated by the stopping of the drug.
Lots of people say the patch between week 3-5 is the worst and I can 100% attest to this. I am just hoping I don't have to be like this for months as my mental and physical health from my chronic pain means I already have VERY low resilience to continue.
I have upped my magnesium, cut out ALL stimulants, am using piriton to help sleep as well as zopiclone 7.5mgs (will be detoxing this in the new year) and eating very clean.
I see lots of ppl on forums saying 'always consult your GP......or........your GP knows best; well in my 4 years of navigating the system (and having worked as a mental health professional before my botched operation I can clarify that certainly 80-90% of GP's in fact know nothing about correct Z-drug, benzo, anti-dep, SSRI or opiate withdrawals. Whatever they tell you to do, I would recommend adding 10 times the amount of time they recommend. Seriously. Dr's are rushed, highly stressed, often utterly incompetent and very often suffering from very sad, grandeous ego complex's. Take what they say with a MOUNTAIN of salt.
Anyway, I will update as my journey continues and let you know when this hell abates.

"Ive really had enough now. 8 weeks now back on 15mg of mirt and i am going through sheer hell. My anxiety is through the roof im yet again off work have been 2 weeks now and i cant go on like this anymore. I fainted through the night on fr/sat. I awoke feeling very sick got up and sat on toilet and felt the faint coming on so slumped to the floor in bucketa of sweat. I didnt pass out completly but took almost 30 mins to recover enough to sit up then was violently sick. It was so bad i thought i was going to loose control of bodily functions!
Ive had horrible what i can describe as restless leg syndrome but its all over my body for weeks now and i feel sick almost all the time. The doctor is so insensitive and feel im just being fobbed off. Ive tried other doctors but always told i need to see the same doctor. I really feel this drug is causing all my problems and its a side effect but i tried coming off this in august with horrendous side effects where i was hospitalised. Doctor tried other ads but being sensitve had awful side effects. So put me back on these. Now i dont know what to do i cant afford to lose my job and cant afford to be off. Dont get sick pay as dont earn enough. I dont feel like me anymore just a walking shell of myself in constant pain and anxiety

"I was put on mirtazapine in May 2013 after I was attacked by my brother a few months before. I was low, anxious and agoraphobic. I was desperate. I couldn't eat and didn't sleep for 6 months. I weighed around 6 stone and felt ill. I am so against meds but gave in and took them but I said I'd only take 7.5mg. It helped, I felt calmer, I worked on the agoraphobia, I slept and ate well. I gained a stone and felt really well. Then at the end of 2013 my family got intouch causing me intense fear and anxiety and I was forced to attend my mums wedding. My anxiety got too much for me having to see my brother there and I started feeling full of anxiety and intrusive thoughts. My GP suggested increasing to 15mg. I agreed so in December 2013 I increased. I have been on 15mg since.
I have always worried mirt didn't help me that much since being on the 15mg but I am much calmer and although I still have anxiety and agoraphobia on and off life is calmer and I cope better if family get intouch. I sleep so well and I love food. 
I became ill last summer with chronic fatigue and I was sure mirtazapine was a big reason, I feel tired all the time no matter what time I take it the night before, i suffer from unreality feelings and zombie feeling every day. My GP said it sounded like CFS and I have now been diagnosed with an underactive thyroid. I have been very unwell with the thyroid but i have wondered if mirt was a big fatigue cause. 
I also have high cholesterol (6.9) GP not worried as I am young and healthy diet but I know mirtazapine raises cholesterol. Should I be concerned about mirtazapine doing this? 
I have gained a lot of weight on the drug but i was always a painful 6 stone, max 90lbs. Now I am 8 stone 10lbs (122lbs) at 5ft tall and can't seem to lose any on mirtazapine. My GP says I don't need to diet as I am a health weight.
I just worry has mirtazapine caused any of my health issues, the fatigue, high cholesterol? and can it have an effect on health the longer you're on it. I have been on it 3 years now and very worried that I shouldn't be on it so long or can you take it long term?
I spoke to my GP and he doesn't think right now is the right time to withdraw. I have had a tough year when my thyroid ill health hit I became anxious again. I overcame alot of my anxiety and life was better than last year I became ill physically due to my thyroid failing. I have been bed ridden at times, I have 3 children to care for, no support other than my husband as I have no family and it has been really tough on us. Finally I think thyroxine is helping and I am feeling a little better in myself but it's been a very hard year getting the correct dose and back on my feet. My GP said right now I need to concentrate on getting over the ill health and the chronic fatigue it's caused. With it it brought back my anxiety and agoraphobia so I have gone back to therapy to get back on top of them again. I know the ill health has set me back as I was doing very well. 
So I know my GP is right, I just worry it will be harder to wean off when I am ready and the fact it obviously hasn't helped my anxiety this time round makes me wonder why I bother taking it now. I do sleep, eat and am a stronger person for being on it but I still struggle with social anxiety and agoraphobia, well since this setback the last year.
I have also read some scary withdrawal stories online so i worry I will always be too scared to come off it.
I just needed to post, I have been really worried about all of this.
Thanks

"Was only on Mirtazapine for 2 weeks, and started to withdraw, as i then remembered why I withdrew the last time, never felt good on them made me sleep when i was already sleeping, then just had anxiety all day for the whole time and cried a lot.... Thought this would be easy this time, with not being on it long, I am a bit low, but wasn't this bad before i took them this time again, I got down to about 2.5 ml, then I thought i would go every other day, but today just feel like hell, have taken 1 diazapam, that has made me feel worse, wasn't so bad yesterday, and i hadn't had, any meds the night before, and even thought maybe i could stop all together, but last night I went into a terrible state, realized I had to take the med, 2ml, but i had the night from hell, so very anxious all night long, took half Diazapam, slept for about 3 hours total, I can't understand how i could go from feeling not bad yesterday to feling like hell today, when i haven't been on them long.... All i wanted last year was counseling for late bereavement, and i am worse than ever after all these tablets...... Has anyone else experienced this, so desperate to know....

"So, I love my Remeron!  It puts me to sleep at night and I was always very thin, now, 15 years later I have exercised for 3 hours at a time, dieted, and done everything else to get back to what I would call a good weight!  I am 6'1"", I was 240 and now down to 200, but my belly fat would not leave!  Tried to stop taking this years ago on a few occassions by tapering off, but I ended up back on it.  
This time I stopped it cold turkey, I take 2 mg of xanax at night to sleep but I started having migraines.  It has been 2 weeks since I took a tablet, but the nausea is bad.  I take 8 mg of Zofran for nausea twice per day which helps.  
I will try to update this later and let you know how it is going.  So far I lost 4 lbs

"Hello I've been on mirtazapine for almost a year now I don't really remember when I started . I was put on this as a weight stimulate and also to help with my insomnia. I went from being 122 to 162 in a matter of months I was eating so much I didn't even realize the amount of weight i gained until I took a picture I finally saw what everybody else was calling me and saying to me : I saw how big I had gotten and hated it I stopped that same night . Ive been off for 3 weeks or 2 1/2 weeks Now. I started out taking 7.5 mg all the way to 45mg 45mg is the dose I was at before I went cold turkey th we withdrawal symptoms are THE WORST THING IVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE ID NOTICE AS I was driving I would think about crashing my car into a tree or just wanna to cs. It's days where I feel sooo low that I can't even begin to think about how Ima gonna survive to see the next day .. I've been very irritable emotional sad crying frustrated on top of that I've been severely paranoid. I can't sleep at night or be in the dark I have to sleep with my tv on and light on, that still don't help with the night mares and the overwhelming anxiety of thinking about the dark feel very vulnerable I'm not as guarded as I felt when I was taking mirtazapine I'm aware of everything now that I wasn't aware of before I'm seeing things good and bad hearing voices I just wanna disconnect myself from the whole world but I'm afraid of being in the house alone.. but I don't wanna be bothered with nobody either I just wanna be surrounded by someone but far away from them from their spiritual being.. I really don't know what to do.. I know that I don't ever wanna take this pill again not even to taper myself off smh

"Hi everyone, I am suffering with depression, anxiety and insomnia. Had been taking citalopram since November but this week doctor has changed me to 30mg Mirtazapine due to their being no improvement in my insomnia and little improvement in my other symptoms.
I find that I am very tired all of the time but have difficulty falling off to sleep. When I do get to sleep I find that I can sleep for a long time (over 10 hours) but still feel tired when I wake up and throughout the day.
I find that having all this extra sleep is not the reason that I find it difficult to fall asleep because even when I set my alarm to wake up early every morning and have a usual amount of hours asleep (6-8 hours) and stick to a sleep schedule I still have difficulty falling asleep at night and feel tired throughout the day.
Has anyone else experienced insomnia of this description and has Mirtazapine helped?

"This is my story make of it what you will, and make your own minds up!
First of all I am a codiene addict as well as a depressive, I have been attending clinics, counselling, doctors, taking part in a reduction program in a bid to recover, for the past 5 years I have been on Fluoxetine, they barely worked and my depression went fairly untreated for years, and as a result my addiction got worse too, I used it as a coping mechanism. 
I had stomach cancer 2 years ago, I had surgery and most of my stomach was removed, as a result I lost well over 15st as I was morbidly obese, I am now about 13st. Since being put on the mirtazapine for the two weeks, I couldnt eat properly and lost more weight and plummeted down to 10st and looked anorexic, the pills made me so thirsty I drank so much water and juices it overwhelmed my kidneys and they recently started failing.
I went to try and stand up and move, I couldn't the pain was unimaginable I couldnt move, I was bed bound, we called the GP who came out and said there is ""nothing medically wrong"" to her i said, hello, I cant stand or move, and she blamed it on my addiction and literally said it was in my head. 
When I could walk, my mum and I went to the surgery and saw someone different, she had to guide me, I kept losing my balance, I went deaf in my right ear, I was told to get some urgent blood tests, I was found to be profoundly anaemic, white blood cells through the roof, kidneys failing, inflammation markers going crazy.
I have experienced increases in the migraines i suffer, I had suffered about 16 of the Rare and common reactions to mirtazapine, it was all put down to an Acute reaction to the drug, I have since taken myself off of them and the fluoxetine and feel so much better as a result.
Complaint to the care commisioning group is now in over the complete misdiagnosis from the first gp who couldnt be bothered to listen to my issues because I am a painkiller addict from what she kept giving me of shoulder injuries!!! 
use this medication at your own peril, it wasnt good for me, but it may be good for you.

"So I took my first Mirtazapine tablet last night (orodispensable). I took it around 12am. I woke up at 2am with severe stomache cramping. I went to the bathroom,and my lips went cold and tingly,my face went tight and tingly and I couldnt keep my eyes or head up/open. I couldnt keep myself awake and it got to the point where my parter phoned an ambulance.
Paramedics told me my blood pressure had dropped, and my temperature was lower than normal. My blood sugar was fine. I was told I could stay at home, but got given an emergency line incase it got worse. I went back to my bed and slept through until this afternoon. Ive woken up exhaused, my body is weak-especially my arms. I dont feel up to much and I am freezing cold.
Is this normal? Ive been told not to take any more of the tablets and to go back to my GP on monday.

"Hi all again i just wanted to get some input into what the heck is wrong with me im sure my doctors are sick of me now.
Ive now been back on 15mg of mirtazapine for around 7 weeks of some of you were aware i came off them 7.5mg cold turkey due to sedative effects through day but suffered severe withdrawl and was in hospital for a week all tests negative. So was put back on the mirtazapine.
But now im suffering severe pins and needles all over head and neck and arms doctors said this was just anxiety but surely i wouldnt be suffering it 24/7. Its actually making me anxious and im scared to go out and having terrible stomach issues (i have ibs anyway) but rather than give me an appetite back its doing nothing and i have no appetite at all. I have trouble sleeping i can fall asleep but if i wake which i do my mind is racing and wont shut off to let me get back to sleep i just dont feel like a normal person at all and my depression is creeping back

"I have been looking on this forum to try and help my mum who seems to be having the most awful time on mirtazapine. She has been on it for 6 mths at 45mg and was prescribed it for Anxiety after my dad suddenly became very ill. She said she hasn't felt good on it and has an awful shake now in her body but the last 6 weeks she has been suffering from chronic diarrhea and bleeding.  She saw the gp who said she didn't think it was the tablets so she left her on them. It is only last week when mum went back and said she still had the problem that the gp said she would take her off of them. She tapered them quickly from 45 then dropping to 30 four days later and then nothing, Mum is now feeling worse than ever, she is sweating profusely and feels awful. She still has the diarrhea and is losing huge clots of blood when she goes. She is exhausted and pale and unable to eat. 
I am so worried that she has been taken off these far too quickly and now is in the most horrible withdrawal. How long will it take for her to start to get them out of her system and feel better. I have told her to contact her gp again on Monday as she is feeling so ill. I am very cross that she has been taken off them so quickly, almost like going cold turkey. I am also furious that she has been given such an evil drug for anxiety, it sounds truly awful. 
I don't live near mum and I don't know what I can do to help her through this. Is the bleeding normal do you think. She has been bleeding for 6 weeks now and it is getting worse.  I am terrified that something else sinister is going on.
Can anyone give me any advice that might help Mum.
Thanks for reading.

"I've just recently discovered that I'm basically walking around in a foggy sort of bubble and I want out.
I was initially prescribed 'Remeron'/Mirtazapine for severe, situational depression a few years ago.  I was unable to eat and lost about 30lbs.
I was afraid to even think of getting off of it however, a few times, I fell asleep (yeah shocker) and forgot to take it and noticed that I was an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSON the next day.  I had energy, hope and clarity.  I was my old self!  It was beautiful!
While I realize that this was just for that one day, I want to be that woman again.
My 'situational' issues have since passed, I have absolutely NO PROBLEM eating (except that I still eat small portions) and I'm bigger than I was before I gave birth!  I can't live this way.  So, I tell my psych doc that I think I want to cut down the dosage.  She's fine with it so I go to 30 and I'm having no trouble until after about a month I realize I'm pretty irritable and kind of bitchy, having mean thoughts and just not a nice person.
So she puts me back on 45, problem solved right?
NO!  I am in a mirtazspine haze.
So sometimes, I treat myself and take nothing just so I can have that one good day...
I found this site and started reading everybody's posts and about your experiences and I've decided to create my own taper plan, based on my past reactions to the different dosage (30mg).
I have warned my husband about what I'm going through and he helps me monitor my behavior and feelings based on how much I take and I think it should be 30mg./15mg. every other day.  This could be difficult given my large dosage and history but I need to go through this.  I want to face my feelings, keep in mind that I could be irrational  and its not me, its the withdrawl and that I will get past it.
I have a very flexible job with low demands and requires a great amount of creativity (very helpful) and need to exercise and am considering giving up meat for the time being since I have trouble digesting it.  I'll stick with fish and some chicken, take supplements, exercise, and hopefully will make it through.
I can't be in a fog anymore.  Life is passing me by and I miss old self!  Also, HUGE ego blow that I don't fit into my sz 6 jeans and have to wear stretchy stuff and hate to go out.  Okay, yeah I'm a little vain/insecure but I can't be that person!  I  miss life!      
This site has helped me realize that this is a real thing.  I'm hoping to just develop a coping mechanism wherein I remind myself that this is part of the master plan/withdrawl phase.  However long it takes, I refuse to become unhinged.
Thank you for posting your comments and experiences.

I just recieved my bottle  of  Ora-Plus and Flavor Plus, I had to order from Amazon, USA. We don't have Mirtazapine in liquid form like you do in the UK.

"I'm now beginning to get worried that either their is something else wrong or the mirtazapine has damaged my stomach. It's been 3.5 weeks now on 15mg from 30mg and I still feel very unwell.
It's looking like a visit to the doctors but what can they give that is fast acting and stop these stomach problems? I meditate, listen to videos, do accupressure, belly breathing all to very little improvement.

"I took one dose of mirtazapine on Friday night, I had a severe reaction and was told to stop taking it.
I only had that one 15mg tablet but it's now Wednesday and I feel awful, jumbled thoughts, my itchy skin is worse than ever, I feel like my brain is rattling around in my head and my nasal passage is really dried out as well as my eyes.
I was upset earlier because I feel so ill, was crying but my eyes wouldn't produce any tears.
The doctor says it's not possible, the pharmacy said it's probably still in my system but it's not withdrawal after one dose but I have never felt like this before in my life, any advice please? Thank you.

"Hi all, I've been on 30mg Mirtazapine for over a year and me and the doc decided I should reduce or come off them, they didn't seem to be helping me much anyway. So for the past 2.5 weeks I've been taking 15mg tablet at night. First few days were fine, then wham, it hit me I felt awful for 4 days, sick, dizzy, fuzzy head, no appetite, generally feeling unwell. This has eased off a little and I'm so nervous of cutting down to 7.5mg I'm wondering how long I should wait before doing so. I know I should speak to my doc but you guys have experience and I feel that you can give me an idea of a good time to cut back again. I'm still having funny feelings in my head and no appetite. Hoping I never have to take AD's again, my main problem is anxiety, insomnia.

"I took a single 15mg dose of Mirtazapine at about 11.30pm on Friday night, I had a severe, adverse reaction to it and was told never to take it again.
I asked how long it would be until it was out of my system and the doctor said a few days, I know the half life is 20-40 hours but does that mean up to 80 hours to know it's cleared or am I wrong with that?
The hallucinations stopped after 24 hours which was great, my co-ordination feels pretty normal again too I think, it was so bad I could not hold a pen and some of the lesser side effects like dry mouth and constipation have lifted too, they went yesterday.
So it has been about 87 hours since I took it now, will it be gone yet?
I am still getting prickly skin sensations on and off but to be fair that may have nothing to do with Mirtazapine, I used to get that with stress.
I just want to know when I can safely say 'Okay it's out of my system' because I will feel much better when I know it's cleared.

"Hi.
I am posting on here out of desperation as really don't know what to do.
I have been on mirrazapine 45mg since the birth of my daughter 4 years ago due to severe post natal anxiety,depression and insomnia.
I have had a couple of good years then due to what I believe could be hormonal issues I have had to add venlafaxine.
Every few months a week to 10 days before my period I loose it. I can't sleep I have panic attacks I can't eat can't leave the house cry all day it really is hell on earth. I also sometimes get suicidal thoughts. During these times it is as if I am not taking any medication whatsoever. It seems to spiral and even my period sometimes doesn't relieve things then I have to increase the venlafaxine. The doctor has said I may have PMDD and agrees my anxiety and depression occurs with my cycles. Each time my doctor increases venlafaxine by 37.5mg and this helps me until my next blip.
I am currently on 45mg mirtazapine 187.5mg venlafaxine. I am in the middle of another blip and am just at my wits end. I am terrified to increase the ven again as it is getting to the point I'm going to be on such high doses I will have no where to go from here. I have been referred to a psychiatrist who has said about maybe switching meds this again terrifies me as I have a 4 year old to look after without having to go through withdrawals.
If anyone has any information on these drugs together please please contact me.
I don't know whether the drugs have just stopped working for me which is why I have to keep increasing or if it is really PMDD and I will have to
keep going through this forever until menopause.
My doctors don't really know what to do with my anymore so I am requesting a referal back to the psychiatrist, I just don't understand how I can be taking two strong medications and still feeling so anxious and depressed.
Thank you to whoever takes the time to read this.

"I was prescibed 15mg per night,took my first one last night and i feel dreadful today.
I am already on 22mg diazepam per day, i do not feel at all ready to reduce that and the gp who prescribed mirt said i don't need to worry about having both together.
Anyway i took the first 15mg tablet last night, took ages to get to sleep, had lots of vivid images when i was dozing off,like dreaming but half awake.
I still woke very early and my co-ordination was awful, i could not even put my make up on properly because my hands would not co-operate, my anxiety is always sky high in the morning but it rocketed until my diazepam kicked in.
After that i felt like a zombie, in the supemarket i had my usual anxiety but i felt so whoozy and faint that i had to leave, sit down in the car and then go back, it is terrifying.

About a month ago my anxiety became unbearable, hard to face customers at work, going out. Everyday things became tough, nothing seemed to make me feel better. I wasn't smiling, just felt utterly hopeless.
Last Sunday something inside me snapped. I decided not to take them anymore. See if I can loose the weight and live without antidepressants. Been on and off them since 2008. In all that time, I hadn't found 'the one' to conquer all my troubles. I honestly feel like they have been making me feel worse depression and anxiety wise.
Since stopping them. I slept well Sunday, Monday and Thursday. Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday night, i got about 3 hours sleep but waking up I was covered in sweat, after waking I just can't get too sleep.
Mentally I've felt fine. I have suffered from nausea, restlessness, fever, chills and aches.
I'm just wondering how long I can expect sleepless nights and night sweats?
I've been taking lots of vitamins and omega three to help me through.
I know when all this is over it will all be fine. I'm feeling confident in dealing with my bodies own natural rhythm.
Thanks

"Hey all,
I thought I would just write a quick posotive up on here as I read so many people saying they have a hard time coming off Miz,
I started  Miz 6 months ago at 15mg, raising to 45mg. I did not like it from the very beggining, it made me angry and not myself at all. I will say it did calm my mind, it stopped the unwanted thoughts. I can't say it lifted my spirits as I was not deppresed per se but was just not happy. It kind of numbs your brain.
I decided 2 weeks ago to attempt to come off it. It worried me a little having read some peoples reports of a withdrawl from it. I have to say I have had nothing..Nada. It had made a tremoundas difference being off it though, I have the energy to do things..I want to do things. People are commenting saying you look bright.
I weaned down by roughly 10mg every 5 days and honeslty never noticed aside from feeling better in myself. I had had horrible pain in my hands since starting this drug and pins and needles sensation in my arms and hands. Once I got down to 7.5mg it stopped completely.
I'm not belittling anybody who has a withdrawl from this, believe me I have gone through 2 withdrawls from a very high dependence of Oxycontin and I can tell you it is HELL on earth so I feel your pain. This is really just to say it might not be so bad for anybidy who is thinking of stopping this horrible drug but us worried about some of the information posted on here.
Good luck to you all.

"Hi everyone,
I've been on 15mg mirtazapine for around a year now. Was put on them as I was having difficulty sleeping. They worked at first but now even while taking them I'm anxious and my sleep isn't all that great. Usual SEs where I'm lethargic, put on weight etc.
I'm wanting to come off them now which my GP is supporting. In the last three weeks I went down to 7.5mg then this week down to 3.75mg but WDs have just hit me.
Increased anxiety, insomnia (3-4 hours broken sleep per night with excessive dreaming) the worst abdominal pain/cramps I've ever had. Just generally feeling horrible!
Is this normal? My GP has said that I am sensitive to any meds anyway. I have another appt with her in 10 days but just wondering what to do in meantime?
Should I go back to 15mg and taper much slower? Any suggestions would be appreciated,
Thank you

"I am currently on mirtazapine which has been great for me, quickly clearing my depression and insomnia, as well as stopping my migraines, nausea and allergies. However, after four years, it has 'pooped out' and I am back to depression and insomnia so I am going to withdraw slowly from it. I started taking 12 grams of inositol yesterday in the hope that it will help me through the withdrawal.
Just wondering if anyone has tried inositol and if so, what were your experiences and how much do you take and when? Has it helped your depression? Has it helped with insomnia? Any problems?
For those of you who haven't heard of it, it is a naturally occuring substance which used to be called vitamin B8, but as the body can make it it is now not classed as a vitamin. There have been some studies which have shown it to be as effective as SSRIs for treating depression when taken at the rate of 12grams per day.
I am taking 6 grams with my breakfast in my mug of tea, and 6 grams after dinner in a soft drink. It is sweet so you need less sugar if you are mixing it into your tea or coffee.

"hi there,
Im a 26 year old male from the UK, I suffer from GAD and have been on SSRIs(escitalopram,citalopram, fluoroxitine) for the past few years to treat it and generally these drugs worked very well...ie I was as close to normal as i think i can be.
Main side effects were sexual dysfunction, and recently I developed gastritis from fluoroxitine and had to come off it.
So as I was at a bit of a cross roads on what to do next I decided to give Mirtazapine a go as ive heard it has no sexual side effects to speak of.
Ive been on it now for about 2 weeks, I started on 15mg at night for the first 12 days. I feel that my anxiety is definetly reduced and that the drug is working. However Im experiencing a lot of drowsyness in the day time. I feel like I never quite wake up. Ive read a lot of material on this drug and theres some evidence to suggest that the drug is less sedating on higher doses. So ive now been on 30mg for the past 2 days. Feel much the same so far. My appetite has also increased but isnt too hard to resist with a bit of will power. Havent put on any weight yet anyway.
Im really hopeful that this drug will work so im willing to stick it out for another month or so, but if the drowsiness doesnt improve I dont know if i can continue with it for much longer.
Has anyone had any positive experiences with this drug, and does the drowsiness ever wear off? Or at least to a point where its managable?

"Dear All
I was on Mirt for about 7 months including tapering down from 15mg.  Did so gradually to 3.75mg in the end. I had side effects of dry mouth and dry eyes and it seemed to stop working so I came off it having spoken to the doctor
That was about 3 months ago.
I still have the dry eyes and dry mouth problems when I thought these has gone away - they came back.  I am now concerned that these are permanent. Has anyone experienced permanent side effects from Mirt such as these?
I also have chronic insomnia.  Maybe 10 hours sleep in the last week.  I can't get to sleep and jerk awake in bed.  Has anyone else experienced long term insomnia from Mirt?  I am worried this may become permanent as well.

"Hi everyone haven't posted in a. While
As you know I've had to come off mirtazapine quite quickly as was causing more anxiety and panic attacks
I am pleased to say that I'm 5 and a half weeks free of this med. I didn't manage to do it completely alone. Doc gave me some olanzapine to take to help level out the withdrawal. I was all over the place. And also put me on sleeping tabs just a low dose until I ride these affects out.
My question is. Has anyone else come completely off and then didn't get any bad withdrawals until over a month after. I've seen someone post on here about protracted withdrawals and wondered if this should be the case for me. Also. How long until I can expect to feel back to normal. The nausea atm is crippling as is the morning depression/anxiety. I'm allowed benzo's but I don't like the effects I've had enough of being a zombie. Also some days I wake up feeling better thinking I'm on the way up to be hit the very next day with crippling anxiety.
Any help would be much appreciated.

"Hello, I've been on mirtazapine for around 2 years for high anxiety and sleeping problems. I've been on 15mg for most of this time and it's done amazing for sleep and not too much for anxiety although I thought it was working on anxiety until I do something out of my comfort zone which can be as little as driving to an unfamiliar place or using public transport which makes me feel terribly sick like I can't swallow and get waves of intense anxiety feeling really sick upset tummy and really tight chest. The chest tightness I seem to get nearly every night even on days I have next to no anxiety? Anyhow around 5 months ago I started taking 22.5mg per night and to be honest it feels no different to taking the 15mg. Over the last few weeks I've started to feel a little more anxious sort of hungover feeling I get a very tight chest and very often when I'm driving I get panicky and feel very sick and feel like I'm going to chock when I swallow which gives me like a adrenaline panicky rush along with a delicate stomach and hot chest. I've been challenging myself recently and have been going out of my comfort zone and been experiencing the anxiety again which I think I slowly coming back again . So a few day's ago I decided to take 2 tablets 30mg every night but the last few day's my anxiety has got worse. I'm even feeling anxious sat at home and out whilst working which I don't usually experience. So my question is should I keep taking 30mg as I have been for the last few day's, or go back to 22.5mg and just hope I was just experiencing a few bad days. And is it possible that changing from 22.5mg to 30mg over the last few days has made my anxiety worse? I'm just worried because the longer I'm feeling this anxiety again the longer it takes me to feel better and fight it off again. Sorry for the long story and thank you for your response.

And I already suffer from anxiety so that's nothing dofferent, I can sleep, I don't appear to have any withdrawal symptoms YET.. I'VE ONLY BEEN OFF A WEEK... and I did have a small piece of a pill like 3 nights ago... so that may have something to do with why the symptoms haven't started yet.. I was on 7.5 for like 4 months... for sleep... I couldn't sleep for 2 nights after stopping and that was it.. I can sleep now. And I do feel a little more anxiety than normal.... but I guess I was just expecting the kind of withdrawal symptoms I got when I stopped ambien or xanax.... or my other medications... I didn't even taper off mirt I quit cold turkey... so...not that I'm complaining, I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. It's just I expected it.

"Hi all well i thought i might give an update on being off mirt.
I was on it from November started at 15mg then from feb just 7.5 as was making me to drowsy. So just around 4 weeks ago i was told to come off the start back on old ad after a few days. I was fine for a few days then let's just say my life has been literally ended unable to go to work. It started with what i thought was a tummy bug or so i thought but it just got progressively worse to the point the pain was 24/7. Back and forth to doctor in agony diagnosed with different things from diverticulitus to which was given antibiotics and had a severe allergy to which i had a suicidal meltdown. Wnet to hospital that night and psychiatric nurse was convinced my breakdown was down to be in so much pain and my body not being able to deal with it. She advised i go to a and e. So i did and was sent home with dihydrocodeine as thiught it was kidney stone. Bad reaction to that was unable to get out of bed the whole day being sick and in pain. Rushed to hospital on the monday morning on a fluid drip and another 3 further bags. Spent a week in hospital had ultrasound blood tests ct scan but all negative yet still in agony unable to eat for pain. They were at a loss and last monday was sent home. So last wed back i go still in agony to doctors and told to stop my ad and start sertraline today but im just no better at all and too scared to start this as side effect is nausea and sickness. My anxiety is through the roof with the pain and nausea. I have another app this morning as dont know what else to do. Does anyone have any insight. This all seems to have stemmed from coming off mirt but surely my pain would have gone by now.

"I haven't been on it that long, maybe a few months, but it seems to be reacting pretty badly with me... maybe it was having some bad reactions with my other medications... but I was acting very slowly, developed hives, very irritable, so spaced out that it was like I was on drugs , now I'm just waiting for withdrawal to set in... the doctor took me off of it and didn't even taper me off ... I was only on it for sleep, it worked great at first, then started giving me all these side effects. I don't think I'll be trying this medicine again. Definitely not for me. Must be a drug interaction.

"Hello people. My husband has been on Mirtazapine 45mg at night for over three months for severe depression and anxiety. His sleep pattern has altered considerably. When he was on 7.5mg he slept a good 6-8 hours. Now he is on 45mg he sleeps 2-3 hours at the most and is awake from 2am onwards most mornings. He was assured the 45mg would knock him out, which clearly they don't. From your experience would splitting the dose to say 15mg at night and 30mg in the morning help?

"I suffer from Anxiety and Depression. In 2012 it became worse and the Cipralex I was on wasn't working for me anymore. I went on Mirtazapine at 30mg. I stayed on Cipralex and My doctor added Clonazapam which also didn't help. I got off of Cipralex and went to Effexor. Effexor helped a little but I still had really bad days. Several months ago I decided to get off of Effexor and try something else. I tried Paxil which was a horrible experience. I tried Tritellix which was also horrible. I finally decided to go back to Cipralex. At 10mg I was OK and then at 15mg I was a basket case. My doctor thought that maybe the Mirtazapine was a problem. We reduced it down to 15mg and a lot of the anxiety and nervousness has gone away. While I have been able to sleep well with Mirtazapine I realy think it's been the cause of my anxiety over the last 4 years. I will try to reduce it to 7.5mg and then to 0.
I wanted to know if anyone experienced the same type of effects and withdrawl.

"Hi, I was on citalopram 20mg for over 2 years but found they weren't working anymore and I was also having trouble sleeping,I got myself a Fitbit and was amazed at how many times I woke up every night and how many times I was restless!!! Went back to the docs and she put me on Mirtazapine 30mg saying they would help me sleep, the 1st one I took knocked me out and I slept much better but then my sleep pattern has gone back to being rubbish, I am on them for anxiety and mild depression, obviously I shall give them more time to work properly but as I was told they have a sedative in them I assumed they would help me sleep better pretty much right away, my doctor checked numerous times that there were other people in the house to wake me in case they knocked me out!!! Am wondering if after a few weeks they will help me
Sleep or if I should be on the 45mg dose.

"Hi, ive been on Mirtazapine for around 9 months 30mg ive been reporting to the Drs that im convinced im worse on these but they didnt want to listen. The weight gain has been horrendous 60pounds in the first 2 month alone making my self esteem plummet. Long story short for the sake of my family i decided to take the plunge and taper off. Took 15mg for a week then nothing since Saturday. I know ive probably tried to do it too quick but if you knew the state i was in you would understand my eagerness to quit it. I didnt believe the way i was feeling was withdrawal symptoms til i found this site. The flu symptoms, aches and pains, headaches, diarhea, palpatations, extreme anxiety, suicidal thoughts, depression, the list goes on. I am now feeling positive after ready these posts that it is just withdrawal and however destroying it currently is, i am confident i am not in relapse and i am just withdrawing and it will pass in maybe weeks or months. I am worse in the mornings even before i am fully awake the anxiety takes hold and spirals quickly out of control sometimes passes around lunch time then just complete exhaustion for the rest of the day and finally improving slightly in the evening. I want to thank people for sharing their stories to help me understand my own situation better and i want to encourage others that it can be done. Take care everyone x x x

"Hey so, I've been on medication since January for severe anxiety and depression, and borderline insomnia.
my mirtazipine was bumped up to 45 mg and I was on 75 mg or pregabalin, and I took the phenegram and zopiclone to basically knock myself out to physically sleep.
As the time went by I no longer needed to take the phenegram and zopiclone and I was sleeping at reasonable times if not early (7-9 pm up at 7-9 am)
But recently I went back to the docs and told her I was sleeping better but my moods weren't picking up or stabilising, so she upped my pregabalin ( 1 morning 2 night) from 75 to 100 and then completely dropped my mirtazipine, the last 4 days have been the worst days of my life,I stopped doing things I wanted to do.
Id started trying to get things running again, I'd planned to start learning to drive, and the meds had made me gain weight so I'd started going to the gym and was starting to be a little more pleasant to be around and I went back to wanting to be alone away from people, inactive and hating every breath I take.
I had to call my emergency line because it was unbareable, and I wanted to know if it was really the best option to drop me off it entirely or not? If im depressed and anxious was it really good to take me off it suddenly?

"I'm 20 years old and was prescribed 15 mg mirtazipine for the first week, and then went up to 30 mg for a little over a month. I felt great at first, but after a while I began to develop edema in my feet and ankles. My psychiatrist refused to believe this was caused by the drug but after a while I stopped takingit on my own. I tried to taper off, but felt horrible so I quit altogether. Now my feet and ankles are fine, but my calves and thighs are now swollen, and have been this way for over a month. I went to get checked out by a doctor and so far they haven't been able to figure out what is causing this. They also don't believe it's caused by the mirt, but personally I don't know what else it could possibly be. I just want my legs back to normal. Could this be caused by stopping it so suddenly? Is the drug somehow stuck in my system? I'm at my wits end here. I'm worried that I'm going to be stuck like this forever all because of this stupid ""medicine.""

"Hi everyone
My name is Tom, I'm a 27 year old male, HIV positive (on treatment), and with a long history of on-going health problems dating back several years, including anxiety and depression / mood disturbances.
I was recently prescribed 15mg of Mirtazapine and took my first dose on Friday night just before bed. Within 20 minutes I felt a serious drug affect - extremely tired and out of it. Just before falling asleep I started experiencing really bad restless leg and arm on my right side - a sore squeezing pain / discomfort, which compels you to stretch your muscles in order to relieve it. I have had this before, but never quite this bad. I eventually fell asleep as the sedative affect was so strong.
Upon waking I still felt completely knocked out and could barely move. It took me ages to finally pull myself out of bed. I felt like I was in a thick fog the whole morning, and my muscles felt extremely weak. I was clumsy, off-balance, and slow in my body and mind. My mood did feel slightly improved already, however this was short lived.
I attempted to cook breakfast but felt so tired and weak I just could not do it. I started feeling extremely frustrated and angry at the slightest thing. After finally eating something I felt even worst, and slipped further and further into what I can only describe as a foggy dissociative psychosis. Every single sound felt turned up by a hundred, my parents voices felt extremely irritating, and I felt extremely anxious. Everything seemed strange and odd. Nothing felt real,and I was just overwhelmed by a sense of impending doom and darkness. My thoughts were muddled and I couldn't think straight at all. In addition, the aches and pains got worse and it felt like I had a really bad flu. I spent most of the day drifting in and out of sleep and my dreams were lucid and surreal. At one stage I was struggling to distinguish between dream and reality. By evening things had slightly improved but I still felt like I had been hit by a bus. My mood was terrible and I just felt rage and anger all the time. I refused to take a second dose last night and I'm so glad I didn't, because this morning I woke up feeling almost as bad.
Has anyone else had or heard of a severe reaction like this before? It felt like I was being poisoned, although I didn't have the classic symptoms of an allergic reaction.
My doctors assured me that although interactions with my HIV meds hadn't been studied, it was safe to take. Although there was a risk that one of my HIV drugs could increase the affect of Mirtazapine, because it is a booster. Perhaps this contributed to how I felt?
Just to say, most of these symptoms I had felt before, to varying degrees. For years I have experienced muscle weakness and pain, difficulties walking and using my hands, clumsiness and balance problems, vision and hearing difficulties, problems with cognition and memory, severe brain fog, heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, sinus problems, exercise intolerance etc.
But there was a clear exasperation of some of these symptoms since taking the Mirtazapine. I experienced the same thing upon starting my HIV medication. Despite this, I have been told by countless GPs, and 3 neurologists that what I am experiencing is psychosomatic / anxiety related. The last neurologist I saw ruled out any HIV-associated neurological complications. Hence why I have been prescribed Mirtazapine.
I have been seeing a naturopathic doctor for several years now and she believes I have damaged my body - predominantly my brain and nervous system, through using recreational drugs, and therefore maintains that there is physiological basis to my symptoms. Could it also be that I have a severe sensitivity to pharmaceutical medications? She strongly advised me against taking any antidepressants, but because I was so desperate I ended up going against her advice.
If anyone has experienced anything similar or has any thoughts it would be really great to hear from you.
Many thanks
Tom

"Hi everyone,
I have been off MZP now for 18 days. I was on 15mg for around a year (just under) for anxiety disorder and depression. My neurologist had brought me off it as he was worried it could be the cause of brain condition I have (iih). I took a tablet every other night for about 2 weeks then broke the tablet in half and went to every three or four days on the 7.5mg for about 14 days more. This was 18 days ago. I am experiencing withdrawal hell and have been so horrendously ill I am getting very depressed again and anxious about working. I have extreme nausea, stomach cramps, headaches, diarrhoea, and the worst most prominent symptom is the travel sickness! I can barely look at my phone/watch TV/socialise, i can't drive and I certainly can't work. This is really getting me down.
Has anyone been through anything similar and know when I may start feeling better? I am in such a hole at the moment and can't function in day to day life. My holiday last week was ruined because of it and my 21St birthday.
The doc has also switched me onto 20mg of propranolol in the mean time. I'm pretty sure I got these withdrawal symptoms before I started my new tablets.
Any help is appreciated!

"Hi I'm new to this but have found some interesting information on here.
I started mirt 6 months ago. This was at my request as I had heard so many good reports with the drugs effect to battle depression. I changed from Trazadone to mirt as 300mg of Trazadone was giving me chronic headaches. I settled on 45mg of mirt which worked somewhat but I was experiencing at least one week a month of crippling depression. I have also put on 31lb! This is despite goin to the gym daily and sticking to a low carb 1200 cal diet most weeks.
I decided to come off mirt 6 days ago. The original plan was to augment with Venlafaxine (Google- California rocket fuel) however I decided to titrate down the mirt and titrate up the ven. Withdrawals have been nasty; nausea, dizziness, eye twitching, trouble sleeping, hot and cold sweats, headaches, foggy head, cold legs and feet, no appetite, extreme fatigue, but I'm persevering. (Nothing compared to opioids withdrawal). Luckily my mood has not dipped as yet. I also take chlorpromazine 100mg and melatonin 2mg to help me sleep.
Due to dizziness and not eating properly I am finding it difficult to exercise so at the moment I am just doing spinning classes. I figured I'm sat down do can't fall down. I am hoping that the withdrawals will get better with time and that I can lose the belly my partner calls fondly ""the cushion"". The cushion is massive!

So, I have reduced my intake by 50% which I am quite pleased with. The plan, now, is to get myself down to 7.5mg every other night, which I will do for a few weeks. And, then, after that, I hope to come off completely. Honestly, that may seem a very fast taper for some people, but it hasn't been too bad for me.

"Hello. This will probably be a long post. But i'd like to start by saying this forum has been a great help to me. Thank you for everyone that posts here. I've been on mirtazapine since i was 18. I'm 26 now. worked my way up to 45mg and stayed on that until 2 years ago when i went down to 30.  
I'm going to mention a few things about me that i think are relevant.
after being on amytryptaline i was put on mirtazapine for insomnia and depression when i was 18. In hindsight my insomnia was from the fact i regularly smoked weed and had become dependent on it for sleep and the depression i'd had for years stemmed from a difficult childhood. i don't believe anything was wrong with me in terms of chemical imbalance or an actual disorder that i couldn't  have resolved myself, had i been mentally capable or had someone to guide me.
 i was an alcoholic from 19 to 25 never daily drinking apart from a couple of month long episodes, but 3/4/5 nights a week to excess. I went through an unpleasent withdrawal off that although not at the delerium stage. had a few months where i've drank to much and had slight withdrawals since but for the last 6 months i've only drank a handfull of times, normally still to excess though. The last month i've had nothing and i'm done with that now.
About 2 years ago i had a hernia operation and struggled sleeping afterwards due to the pain. I upped my dose to 60 mg thinking it would help me sleep better. I was at 60mg for about 5 weeks. i didn't notice any side effects but i was on codeine and other painkillers throughout and felt pretty off it anyway.
 went straight back to 45mg and for the next few weeks i noticed i felt quite nauseated and also had something which i wouldn't have been able to describe if i hadnt seen it written on here as ""brain zaps"". These happened mostly when i was in bed. Having had an operation pushing my bowels around and having being on codeine for over a month i didn't pay any attention to these symptoms and they went within a month.
 I went to the doctor at the start of this January and told him i wanted to start tapering down as i didn't like the side effects it had given me, particularly affecting my social life. I think once i was on this drug i lost my spark and most of the charisma i had. the side effects took a while to kick in and i think because the process was gradual i was unaware anything had changed. People i'd not seen for years pointed it out to me though. My dreams were messed up and i would get dizzy occasionally. For a reason i couldn't work out the doctor didn't think that coming off it was a good idea but i told him i was going to do it anyway and i could do with his advice. He said to halve 30 mg for 2 weeks then stop. He also said there'd be no side effects.
 A few days went by and i started to itch on my back and the lower half of my legs. A woman at work had gone home because of itching the first day i noticed it, so again i thought nothing of it and thought there might be  chemicals around or dust or something like that. Itching got worse and went to my stomach as well even though i'd had a short break from work. Thought it may have been because id switched a brand of supplement i'd been taking or because i was using a different shower gel. I even brought shower stuff meant for babies incase it was that haha
 about 10 days on 15 mg i was starting to get less sleep as well and generally feeling ill so i went back to the doctor and asked his advice again. The only thing i'd noticed about mirtazapine was i slept better on high doses, although that goes against what i read on here. He said to try 22.5mg for a week but from his demeanour i could see he didn't really believe me. He also gave me a speech on how some people think doctors are in on a conspiracy to get us drugged up so they profit from it, and i shouldn't come on forums like this one because they fill your head with rubbish. At this point it wasn't in my mind that reducing mirtazapine was causing me any symptoms other than insomnia. He'd told me there would be no withdrawal, I believed him and id approached it with a positive mind. I'd not looked anything up to do with mirtazapine. That changed when i got home.
 i found this site and it's helped me a great deal in terms of knowing what to expect, to reassure me that i'm not losing my mind and has pointed me in the direction of sources to show that my doctor's recommendation for withdrawal was too fast.
 since January 24th i was on 15 mg and as of last night i had about 2mg. I dont have scales to weigh doses. i break ten days worth of pills into roughly the same size and take them biggest to smallest. the smallest pill is then used as the marker for the next lot that i break. I make them slightly but noticeably smaller than the last of the previous batch then repeat the process. 
 I'l try and keep this short, these are the symptoms i've noticed since january
Brain zaps - occasionally. between 15mg - 7.5mg. none since below 7.5mg
Anxiety - I get nervous in social situations, not overwhelmingly but i can feel myself blushing and i stutter a bit when i speak sometimes. Mainly just with people i'm not good friends with. This didn't happen when on 30mg, i just had no desire to talk to people haha
Sleep Disturbance - nowhere near as bad as i feared so far, waking up a few times a night but getting 5 hours or so. 
Confusion - cant explain it other than i feel like i've just appeared in a situation even though i was concious of entering it. My memory is bad, particularly short term. I can get half way through a sentence and i just lose track completely. This doesn't happen often though.
Jittery - my body feels shaky and i'm easily startled. People saying hello makes me jump or if theres a sudden loud noise that i'm not anticipating my hearts jumping around! Any sort of stress or conflict that i witness makes me feel like im vibrating and i feel sick.
Lethargic - I've felt really sedated the past 2 weeks, not much energy and constantly tired.
Itching - a tiny bit, not really a problem anymore.
Racing thoughts - i would have thought i'm losing my mind if it wernt for this site.
Manic - I have moments when i'm really hyper, mentally.
Nausea and lack of appetite - not too bad managing to eat 3 meals a day but i'm not really hungry for them. Feel a bit sick in the morning and after eating
Dreams - when i do sleep my dreams are very intense and sometimes extremely disturbing and graphic. 
Sweats - couple of night sweats, i have a clammy face in the day and look terrible.
Depersonalised - feel a seperation between my mind and body. Weird feeling but i'm ok with it.
 My withdrawal symptoms would be scaring me and i would have been off work a long time ago had i not been through similar before. When i came off alcohol i went to a n e thinking i was having a heart attack. 
Positives - despite being tired i mentally feel more awake. even though that contradicts itself. i do feel more social i just have a little melt down when i talk to most people haha i also have had no craving for junk food and have lost about half a stone.
I'm posting this now as of today i'm stopping taking it altogether. a situation with a colleague at work over the past week (which i've been cleared of any wrong doing by the way, and have been asked if i want to make an official grievance against him) has led to me being able to use my holiday in one go so i have to take advantage of that. Other people causing me stress isn't worth it, but up until now i've have held my job down despite how i feel. The symptoms of tapering so far have been unpleasant but nothing i've not been through before and are manageable. Its the duration of it thats getting me more than anything and obviously i've not stopped taking it altogether until tonight.  A little bit concerned if i'm a bigger mess than i am now when my holiday runs out, then my doctor might not sign me off because ""there isn't withdrawal"". But both managers i spoke to today were really nice to me after i explained my situation and have said they'll do anything they can to help me so i'm in a good mood. Got no other pressures to deal with so i'm looking forward to it in a twisted way. It will be nice to be able to post here when i'm through it all, so i'm sticking it out whatever happens/ however long it takes.
 If you want to take advice from me i'd say to sort your diet out. I.e no processed foods or ready meals, drink water or de caf tea, get your fruit and veg. Remove anyone that causes you grief from your life. Walk away from any situations with tension. If you are physically capable then be outside as much you can. Exercise as vigorously as you can. Listen to music with a positive message behind it. Don't watch the news or read the newspapers. I don't think it's healthy to be bombarded with stories of paedophiles, people getting blown up or murdered on a daily basis anyway. Let alone when you have this to deal with as well. Focus on the positive things in your life. Even if it's one good thing for every 100 bad, the bad are irrelevant when your mind is elsewhere. Think of what you take for granted at the moment and concentrate on appreciating it. 
 This drug worked initially but i was on it way to long. I also feel if i'd have taken a month off smoking weed and would have had someone in my life who could teach me how to think with a positive mind, then i wouldn't have needed any medication for depression or insomnia. I'm not saying that's true for everyone but i feel for the sake of a quick fix i've been in a fog for my best years and i can't get that time back.
 if you read all this then thankyou, and i assume you're going through the same so good luck to you. Be patient and stay positive.

"I'm 17 and have been on 15mg of remeron for I think 2 years I was given it as a sleep aid because ever since I was little I have had trouble sleeping. Well this summer I set out to try and get off of medicine. I'm having extreme trouble sleeping, I normally stay up somewhat playing games with friends but I normally would get off around 11 and go to bed. It's 3:45 am right now and I'm wide awake. How long will this insomnia last. My mother was given this at one time and for the same reason she had all the other side effects commonly seen for withdrawal from this except trouble sleeping. I only have insomnia and I'm almost 3 weeks in without taking it.

"Hi, everyone, this is a very interesting forum. :D
Click here to view image
I was prescribed them for stress/anxiety/weight loss, I had a really bad time a few years ago, I lost my house, job, car, had to go bankrupt, fell out with family (but thats a whole different forum :shock: )
At the time I was feeling really dizzy and had a headache every day and could not function and the dr diagnosed stress/anxiety/depression. I was also, (I found out later, very anaemic for B12 and now I am on injections for the rest of my life) I now wonder if this caused some of my symptoms :?
I have gone from 8 stone to 11 and half stone on these damn tablets, I just eat and eat and eat and its really getting me down :x .
Anyway now, I have since last October, a sore, burning feeling on my tongue and a horrid taste in my mouth, could this be connected to the Mirtazapine?? I am going to the drs next week but I have decided again to try and come off them. I am going to take one full tablet one night and a half tablet the following night and so on for 2 weeks, then I will just take half a tablet per night for the next 2 weeks and then half a tablet every alternate night for 2 weeks and then stop. Does anyone know if this would minimise any side-effects? I don't mind side-effects if i knew they would not last forever, I would persevere with them for a while if I could only come off the tabs and feel better.
I am so tired all the time, I have terrible dreams, I still wake up in the early hours. I have not had sex with hubby for 3 years :oops:Wish I had not started taking them in the first place

"Hi guys, 
I signed up for this forum to exchange thoughts about tapering Mirtazapine. I have been taking 15 mg from january. I took it because I could not sleep anymore. Had four nights where I did not sleep at all. It all started with some kind of buzzing in my ear. This is better now, although it is not totally gone.
I have been slowly tapering to 7,5 mg and now I am only using 5 mg since 10 days. I am really struggling with side effects from tapering. Been feeling kind of low and sleeping not very well. Last night I took a little Xanax because I felt sooo awake. Smallest dose, but I hate having to take this. Muscles seem to hurt and I am having some trouble with my stool, if you know what I mean.
I have been tapering for some time now, and I just know this wil sort itself out in a few days time. Usually the 12 - 14 day mark is when I start feeling better and start sleeping better again. But I am curious about other peoples stories.
Are you tapering Mirtazapine as well, or did you do a succesful taper?
Am I going to fast maybe?
I am feeling a bit insecure now about this right now. I hate feeling like this. I read somewhere that tapering from 7,5 mg down is more difficult then from higher doses. Is this true?

Felt totally wiped out was crying all the time felt anxious all the time and it upset my stomach. Those were stopped was put on beta blockers which did nothing. Ended up very poorly and took overdose. Was prescribed mirtzapine in hospital which were ok for a week or so but once I returned to work felt grogginess unmanageable plus constantly hungry was still waking at 5 am! Rang gp the other day he said to come off them as I had not been on them long so I have. I'm back at work on phased return which is helping a bit but still feeling very low not myself at all. Feel like the life has been sucked out of me. Motivation very low don't know what to do with myself feel very withdrawn and I'm scared. Got gp appt Monday don't know what they will suggest now I feel at a loss. My family are great bit they don't know what to do either. People say it will get better but at the moment I just can't see it. Should I try new tablets? Try no tablets? Please can anyone help me I don't know what to do. Thanks

"I've been on mirtazapine for about 6months now. 3months at 30mg and 3months at 45mg. I was put on it due to generalised anxiety and mild depression from a build up of stresses in my life. It hasn't been plain sailing and to be honest the only thing mirtazapine has done is help me sleep. My anxiety is much reduced compared to before I went on, but I genuinely feel like I'm only as good as I am because I've done it myself with life changes etc. I've just gone back to work and it's really good for me socially. 6months into mirtazapine and I'm starting to become upset by the constant feeling of numbness, miserable mood, irritability, and the weight gain is starting to make me miserable. I can deal with a bit of weight, as i was skinny anyway, but like all my work clothes I purchased a month ago are all now too small. It's becoming upsetting and I can feel the anxiety creeping back in. I feel like the fact the mirtazapine is making me feel miserable and low, is setting off my anxiety again, and I am wondering if anyone else has in fact felt better after stopping mirtazapine? I have a docs appointment to discuss coming off in a few weeks.

"Has anyone had this since being on Mirtazapine? I have been on 15mg for about 4 months, and since then I have developed muscle twitches / muscle fasciculations in varies places all over my body. They don't hurt, they don't happen all the time, but when they do they kind of jump from place to place. For me, the worst places are my right shoulder, my right bicep, and my thighs. See, I also have anxiety, so it's possible this could be responsible for the fasciculations, and there is also a pretty common condition called Benign Fasciculation Syndrome that causes it, too. I guess I just wanted to check with other Mirt takers, or former takers, to see if they have suffered from this strange symptom, so as to put my mind at ease.

"Hi Everyone,
My fiance has been on Mirtazapine for 2 weeks and is sleeping 15+ hours a day (only awake to go to work). The other thing is that when he is awake he seems to have lost interest in 'us'; he says he loves me and is just completely exhausted and, obviously, I'm not about to hastle him over it but just wondered if anyone else has experienced any loss of loving feeling while on this or is it just tiredness? I'm not talking about sex - which is pretty much on hold anyway - it's the loss of loving, cuddles etc. It isn't the end of the world if it passes eventually but I would be devastated if I lost this lovely, loving man because of a drug.
Is it still within the bounds of normality to be this tired after 2 weeks as most sites seem to say that it subsides after the first week? I hate seeing him so exhausted all the time.
Many thanks for taking the time to read this.

"Hi, I start using mirtazapine 22.2.2016 to getting off opamox but now
i realize that first I just tried to get off too quickly. It took 2 months to get 
off opamox. It was bad mistake to take mirtazapine I think. First I used 7,5 mg dose maybe one month and then second  month I use 15 mg and then I start to stopping slowly. It took two and half month to go 15 mg to 3,75 mg but then it went much harder. I allways make a liquid. 15mg mirtazapine and 500 grams water. Last days I took that water 123 grams = 3,69 mg mirtazapine 12 days period and then I tried to taper 1 gram per day that liquid. When I take 122 grams it effect more than I think. Next day after that I took 121 grams and then I feel so bad that I can't taper anymore next day and maybe even back to 122. This seems allmost imbossible to get off. I know that I don't have any sickness on backround. These is just 100% withdrawing symptoms. I will start to school next month 10.8. Can you help me and give some tips what I should to do? During this four and half month mirtazapine period I have gain weight 10 kilograms. I also can't exercise when using this drug, just a little walking. When I started to use mirtazapine my doctor and two other persons say that it won't be problem to get off mirtazapine but now its much much bigger problem that it was to getting off opamox. Sorry my bad english.

"So, guys, I may be taken off Mirtazapine as soon as tonight. I shall keep you all informed. I phoned the weekend on-call doctor, about pains that I have been having in my hands, my formarms and my shoulder. The doctor asked, after going over details about my hands and arms, if I was taking any medicine, to which I replied Mirtazapine. She then asked if I had any strange races on my skin, and I told her that I get hives/nettle rash all the time, all over my arms, my body, everywhere, and that I get this at least twice daily. So, I am now going to see the doctor tonight, because they think Mirtazapine is responsible for my skin rash and my sore muscles, as none of these started until after I started taking Mirt.
Shall I keep you all updated?

"Hi there
I'm in the process of going from Citalopram to Mirtazapine.
I was on Sertraline for many years and then it seemed to stop working (lose its effectiveness) last year when I got physically ill quite badly. My gp put me on Fluoxetine but after a month it gave me headaches so I asked to go on Citalopram as my sister is great on it. I began taking it (20mg)in January and by March I was feeling good and was back at work after 6 months sick leave but then at the end of March I asked to go higher as my Dad had had a stroke and I wanted something to help me through it, it helped a bit (30mg) but I got physically ill and my mood went lower too (back off work :-( ) so I went up to 40mg at beginning of May but that made mood worse :-(
I went down to 20mg last week and am starting 10mg with 15mg Mirtazapine this week then just Mirtazapine week after.
Is anyone on Mirtazapine? Has anyone found it helps them?
I really need to get better.

have been having sore legs, elbows and back lately especially in the morning. Plus I feel really groggy in the morning and it takes me I told my GP about this but he didn't think there was a link with Mirt. I've reduced it to half tablet a night and things are better although I'm still groggy am.
As to the munchies it's true and I try not to snack. I am slim just now but I know I'm eating more. Planning to go off it and just take propanolol for anxiety. The idea of putting on weight stresses me out after all the effort doing exercise.

"A few people have asked how to make a home made liquid to taper off mirtazapine. This is how I did it. It allowed me to make drops of as low as 0.1mg. You need a pill grinder, a 1ml syringe with 0.1ml markings, A small bottle, An acurate measuring jug or container, some maple syrup or similar flavouring.
I made 60ml each time. Each ml = 1mg of mirtazapine.
Grind up 4 x 15mg mirtazapine pills using the pill grinder. If you have the normal pills, the pill coating does not grind so fine as the mirtazapine inside, but don't worry about that. Measure out 30 ml of water and mix in 30ml of maple syrup. Put into bottle and shake. Pour in the mirt and shake. Keep in the fridge for up to two weeks. Shake vigorously before using syringe to measure the required amount of the liquid. 1ml = 1mg of mirt, so very easy to do. The mirt does not disolve which is why you have to shake the bottle well each time you dose.

"I'm having trouble figuring out how to read syringes as I taper down. I'm using a 10 ml and a 1 ml syringe. I'm trying to go 5-8% at a time but last time I only went 3% just because that amount was much easier to figure out. I've tried googling ""How to read syringes"" but not much help.

"Hi all not been on for a while I just wanted to know if anyone else has this side effect or if this isn't the mirt. I've been on mirt 15mg since November last year I'd lost a lot of weight and depression after loss of parent. I'm 42 by the way. Anyway it did it's job and helped with appetite and depression but over say the last 4 months I have have severe nausea all day and I'm conscious of it all through the the night and on waking. I literally have no appetite due to this. My doctor decided it could be mirt and I've now been on 7.5mg for a week I've had no side effects other than still feeling nauseous it's driving me crazy I even cut dairy and gluten out but no difference any input would help thanks

"Ok so not only has this horrible drug given me constant nausea now after being tapered down to 7.5mg for just over a week I have the horrible feeling of doom slowly coming back last two mornings on waking which remains most of morning. I don't think I can cope with being back to the severe depression again. What I wanted to know is is there any anti depressants that anyone's on that don't have debilitating side effects . I tried many over the years and dosulepin was great but it pooped out after 7 yrs. Also are some people just prone to depression I fear that I will have to live with this the rest of my life and scared stiff. It always hits me after a stressful situation in my life first time after separation then months after my mums death. I have 3 teenage boys but feel very much on my own

"I am a female in my early 20s living with anxiety, depression and OCD for a number of years. I have been on 40mg of fluoxetine for about 2 years now. Helps quite a bit with my OCD symptoms but depression was still a big issue, my psychiatrist and doctor then prescribed 30mg of mirtazapine in addition to the fluoxetin. Within a few months I gained 50lbs and with the weight gain came less self confidence, less self care and more depression. I am now off the mirtazapine and in my 9th week of weekly CBT but still feeling lost and feeling awful about the weight gain. Anyone else have any similar experiences or some advice?
Thank you.

"I finally went to my doctor in march as I had been feeling down for well over a year,
but didnt think it was anything serious until my flat mate made me relise that this was more than just feeling down. So this is the third anti depressant I've tried, since March.
The other ones which were citalopram which did nothing at
all and then went onto fluoxetine was only on that for a 8 days but made me really moody and
snappy and the slightest things annoyed me. So i came straight off fluoxetine and I'm now on
mirtazapine 30mg at night. After the first night of taking it I didn't sleep good at all then I woke up with a pounding sore head and felt totally spaced out all day stayed in bed all day till half 4. The next day I had a bit of a sore head and still felt a bit spaced out. I'm now on day 5 of taking them I feel tired all day and there not really helpin me sleep and so far my mood hasn't changed at all.
But I'm a bit worried that they will make me gain weight as I'm tryin to lose weight and really don't
want that to happen. Has anyone been on these and not gained any weight?
I'm so fed up of feeling like this to the point where ending it all is all I can think about and think would be better than going through this hell everyday :-(

Today I have the most extreme muscle ache in my legs and back.  I remember having this pain when I went upto the 30mg.

"Hi everyone,
I posted a while back asking about weight loss coming off Mirt 30mg a day. I've tapered myself down to 7.5mg, and while experiencing a dip in my mood and a lot of tiredness, I still have a horrible raging appetite and I can't lose weight. 
I have EDNOS with a strong binge/purge tendency. I struggle with body image at the moment and gained 4 kilos after starting Mirtazapine. At the moment I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror, I only wear baggy clothes and I can't even sit down without feeling miserable. It's hell. I am terrified that my appetite won't go down after I come off Mirtazapine and I'll have to deal with it for the rest of my life. I desperately want to lose weight but NOTHING seems to work and I find it so difficult to prevent binges. If I start eating anything with carbs or sugar I can't stop eating. I really really need help - when will the weight gain stop? I'm coming down again to 3.75 tomorrow. 
(Also on 225mg Venlafaxine o/d, 150mg Pregabilin t/d, 100mg Lamotrigine b/d, but none of these seem to give me any problems weight-wise).

"Hi there,
For the first time in a very long time, I'm finally in a good enough place to make the step in coming off my Anti-depressant. I've been on Mirtazapine 45mg for the last 4/5 years and before that a string of various of medications.
Despite my anxiety been kind of excessive at the moment, after a discussion with my GP, he was happy to let me begin tapering down the dose. The problem is with my anxiety I feel it mainly physically rather than mentally so it makes me a little oversensitive to any changes that take place in my body.
I guess what I am searching for is some reassurance so I can stop driving myself up the wall, exhausting google search on mirtazapine withdrawal. 6 nights ago I started my first reduction so 45mg to 30mg. In all honesty it's not been that bad, a few waves of nausea, headaches and random aches and pains. Those I was expecting so don't mind too much. The trouble is that for the last 3 days, I've found myself a little short of breath for most of the day. It's nothing thats outwardly noticeable at the moment, but it's there and is slightly concerning. Has anyone else experieneced this when tapering?
I'm knd of freaked out a little because one of my fears thats arisen since the mirtazapine is the that i will develop random allergys and my brain is wondering if I've suddenly developed an allergy to my meds (ridiculous, I know!) The other thing is that the rest of my family has had either viral chest problems lately so maybe I've just picked up that and it's a coincidence? Or it could just be the anxiety...
I'm totally spinning myself in circles at the moment so any wise words are most welcome at this point. If I know it is just withdrawal and nothing that can actually hurt me than I'm fine with whatever effects it throws at me.

"Hi All, I am from Australia Melbourne to be percise and would really apprecaite peoples thoughts. So some 12 months ago I had a major panic attack due to smoking cannabise. It lasted or 6 hours and every mucle in my body was twitiching out of fear. I haven't touched it ever since, i dont think any sane person would. I don't want to write my life story but basically i got 3 more anxiety attacks after that incident which were no induced ny any substances. This got me panicing and I was on vallium for 3 weeks while starting a drug called arropax. started at 20mg and went up to 50mg and have been on it for 12 month. I found that it was working but the last 3 months I have been feeling anxiety and depression and mainly insomnia for a while. sorry whithin the 12 month of taking arropax i have been excerising and tried CBT with more then 3 phycologists. Under the recommendations from a phycistrist I have started Mirtazapine and gradually reduced arropax from 50mg to 40mg to 30 etc weekly and at 10mg i started taking 7.5mg of mirtazapine. If i havent lost you so far, I starting taking 10mg of arropax in the morning and 7.5mg of mirtazapine while also taking 5mg of vallium. I then under the supervision of my gp was told take 15mg of mirtazapine with stop the arropax completely. I have been taking 15mg for mirtazapine for 1 week and tomorrow I will start 30mg of mirtazapine. OK so I am feeling irrational angre and anxiety has increased to a certain extent. I went to the gp today because I was experincing not so much anxiety but mood swings and a lot of agression so I took a vallium and it somewhat simmered down. I went to the gp to explain what happened and he told me to take 30mg with a vallium a day untill we reach a more theroprudic dose. I have vowed to myself to do what the professional tell me but in my mind I wanted to stop all of the anxiety/depression pills period and just cope it on the head and see what happens, worse comes to worse i thought i would take a vallium and if it didn't get better then I will start over with mirtazapine, these were only thoughts in mind because I have done heaps of research and it scientests have no proven the chemical imbalance theory and really do not 100% know how to cure anxiety. There is are theories about these drugs and most of them have heaps of unwanted side affects like my irrational angre. Anyway I am still sad mainly because I can't hold a job or a relationship. I am now going to try a new type of therpy called Phychoanalitical therapy which is the tradtional way of actaully looking into your past and reconciling with whatever it is that is making me this way. I will start my new dose of 30mg tomorrow and 1 valluim per day. It feels debilitating that I have to take vallium with something that is meant to control my anxiety but I am only taking it because the irritation and edgyness is so drastic that i can't be myself, just always on edge. The hope is that eventually the drug will kick in and will drop of the vallium and increase it to 45mg or so while going to the gym and trying this new phychotherpy i have never done before. The gp says that if i am stil feeling really angry and sensitive then we will have to try something else. I am confused hence why I am using this forum to get idea to help me ease through this process. Thanks everyone in advance.

"I was put on Mirtazapine about 24 months ago... and it hasn't been a pleasant experience. I gained excessive weight around 25 pounds I think I'd still be gaining if I wasn't tapering down to get off it I'm starting to loose some of it finally since I finally can stop myself from eating too much most of the time. 
But I'm stuck at 7.5 mg currently because of having serious withdrawal. This seems to happen every time I drop my dose down. I've had flu-like symptoms, I'm irritable more often than not, been having insomnia than the reverse when I finally sleep. My focus has been horrible most recently and it is driving me nuts I can't sit down and read a book, or write creatively and working with my horses isn't easy either because you have to be able to hyper-focus with them. Thankfully I have an old school master who doesn't even twitch because of my erratic unfocused behaviour. Which I am every so grateful for his acceptance my filly is learning not to be bothered by it which in the long run is a good thing.
But I have been on this dose for a few weeks and hoping some of these symptoms go away soonI want my focus back most of all. So I can drop all the way off this medication and I'm curious will these symptoms come back full force?

"Hi,
I've been on 15mg of Mirtazpine for six weeks now for anxiety with depression after a recent diagnosis. I'm still very new to all of this. I think I can honestly say that my more traditional anxiety symptoms have definitely improved ie palpitations, nervousness, nausea and being jumpy.
With that said, the total number of symptoms that I was experiencing before being diagnosed was vast - I never knew that anxiety can mean having so many different symptoms at different times. I still get some of these symptoms but cannot tell whether it's just some minor ongoing side effects from the Mirtazapine or the symptoms themselves that the medication isn't tackling eg momentary dizziness, sudden 'warm adrenal' feeling shooting up the legs, uneasy sensations and feeling low.
I think I'm on the right road generally with recovery as I also have a regime of various self-help measures such as regular exercise, daily meditation, drinking plenty of water and am starting some CBT later this week. I just thought by now my overall mood would be lifted and the remaining anxiety symptoms would be improved but the Mirtazapine just doesn't seemed to have tackled this. Or is 6 weeks still too soon?
My doctor put me up to 30mg only last week but after the second day I was starting to feel quite ill and nauseous. This worsened after a couple more days and I really felt that i wasn't able to tolerate this higher dose so I went back to 15mg and am now feeling normal again.
I know we're all different and these meds affect us all differently but how long should I give Mirtazapine before I can say that it's done all it's going to do?
And does anyone else experience ongoing side-effects from Mirtazapine even though they've been taking it for a while?
Your thoughts are greatly appreciated!
Many thanks.

Can anyone help. Have had some real difficulty tapering to come off mirtazapine.
Just a brief history:
Originally tapered too quick from 30-22.5-15-7.5-3.75 and then off over about 3 weeks. After 4 months on. So then went back on at 2mg but felt awful again. So then went back to 7.5 again. Felt alright and did this for 7 days and then tried to go down to 5.75 but am now feeling awful again. I really want to come off this stuff but just don't know how. Can anyone please help. I feel like I'm going crazy.
Should I just stick it out a bit longer on 5.75 or go back to 7.5. If I go back how long would someone suggest I stay on this level and what dose should I follow next.
I just don't know what to do...,

The pain is epigastric, high in the abdomen just under the ribs. Each time that I had gone back on the mirt, the symptoms vanished. This time I had to get off the drug because of heart rhythm side effects. The pain gets a little better at times, but is always there. I was on the maximum 45 mg dose for 8 years before starting to try getting off the Remeron because of side effects. Am I the only one who has or is having this problem? Thanks for any replies!

"Hi guys
So I got an emergency appointment at the pdoc today because my gp is not happy with how I'm reacting to things after a month of doing a 15mg taper
I went through all the normal withdrawal symptoms but they just won't settle. Diazipams don't help my main problem is fatigue an inability to relax . which is affecting my sleep even though I'm taking zopiclones
Have had new issues like no appetite lost a stone in a month. Muscle spasms especially in my legs and jaw.
So explained this all to doc said i think it's still withdrawal but he doesn't agree. He is sending me for a full set of bloods and will check my thyroid as I have 2 sisters who suffer. I actually was examined this time and according to my records i haven't had a blood test in 5 years! Nearly the whole time i was on mirt!
Also I have really high blood pressure which is the opposite of me really in the past when any doc has taken it they struggle to find a pukse and look up and joke with me ""your dead"" lol always been slow soometimes 90 over 50 so he does want me off mirtazapine but because of how I'm responding has given me olanzapine to help with withdrawal
The aim is to use it as a stabiliser to wean me off mirt and put me on prozac. Then wean me off that when i stabilise.
Im gonna be honest guys of course i came home and Google it! Im petrafied! Says it makes you tired and that's one of my problems already i want to be out getting on with life. But i do understand that now everyone has realised the mirt is no longer doing me any good and I need to come off safely but because of blood pressure I've got to do it quickly ajd I hadn't planned for that
Has anyone had any experience with these? Ive reduced the mirt to 22.5 and start taking the olanzapine 22.5mg tonight in replacement of zops and diazzy's

Luckily I have seemed to get away without nasty withdrawals but last night I went out for the first proper night out since I'd started them in December.  I haven't drunk much in all that time so was quite prepared for a bad hangover but actually wasn't hungover in the usual sense but have had the worst anxiety all day.  I have never ever been aware of feeling this anxious before and have actually stayed in bed all day missing out on a glorious sunny day.  Has anyone else found this or is aware of this happening?

"I'm new to this website, it' been interesting reading some of he varied reaction to Mirtazapine so I thought id give my experience with it.
I was prescribed 15mg to start with for about 3-weeks for anxiety. Was helping me sleep like a baby and found it hard to get up in the morning. Apart from sleeping, It only helped me that way. 
I was upped to 30mg about three and half weeks ago and its knocks me for six in the mornings. Weeks before last I could see a good change happening and could feel myself get better as the day went on. This week has been a complete nightmare, I have even had a week off sick from the doctor. I've had - Anxiety, no appetite, tired all the time, light-headed and can' deal with stressful situations. I know that last Saturday I forgot to take my 30mg tablet after I ended up having a few too many pints down the pub, but since that saturday I have been so ill with bad nerves. I don't think I want to touch alcohol again.
Since been on Mirt my appetite hasnt really got better at all, in fact worse I think. I sometimes feel my blood sugars drop during the day which in itself to me is quite frightening. I'm not sure if that's a sign of the medication or perhaps because I havent been eating, Im not sure. But I do try to force myself to eat.
Yesterday, I went to pick up my repeat prescription and was getting extremely panicky in the car that I had to drive back home and go to bed. Im so glad I have time off work to chill out. 
I'm starting a new job with the hospital in two weeks and Im hoping to get myself better by then. Im not sure if I should keep taking my 30mg and hope for the best Im not sure.

"Hi. I have recently been diagnosed with depression and it's been a bit of a nightmare with my meds as I can't find one that suits me. I have been on fluoxetine 40mg for several years for my PMT but this wasn't helping my depression. My doctor starting me on mirtazapine and it really did make a massive difference, I felt like I had me back even after just a few weeks of taking it. The only problem was I was piling on weight, which due to other health problems is not an option for me. I put on nearly 2 stone in 6 weeks so I came off it. My doctor wasn't happy I'd taken myself off it but after some persuasion she has now put me on sertraline 50mg. After a month of taking it every day I am still terrible. I'm not sleeping..I am more anxious then I've ever been, I'm not going to have any skin left on my lips and around my nails, I have a rigid fac and jae making me constantly tense and I can't relax at all. I am having mild suicidal thoughts too which I didn't even have before I started taking AD meds. I don't know what to do, I am getting worse daily and I am a single parent of 3 young kids and I have 2 businesses that are all being effected. As my Doctor isn't interested and I can't get into see her over the next 3 weeks I am considering starting toi take the Mirtazapine again, temporarily, until I can see her. Any advice would be much appreciated.

"Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me...
I was put on 30mg of mirtazapine and took it for a week alone with 2mg of an anti-psychotic called rispiridone. I was told I was only mildly depressed. At first I felt brilliant but then a week into my treatment I developed anxiety so bad that I can's focus on anything, can't keep still, can't relax and have constant panic attacks or onsets of panic attacks for no reason. I came off mitazepine immediately because this scared me so much and then came off the anti-psychotic a few days later as my symptoms were worsening. I've now been off them for 5 days but still feel terrible. I can't even sleep properly due to then anxiety. I've tried massages, rescue remedy, everything I just feel so uncomfortable. I've never felt anything like this before and desperately want it to go away. Could the medicine really have such a bad effect after only taking it for a week? I'm very underweight and was wondering if the dose was too strong for me?
Any advice on when I'll start to feel like my old self again will be greatly appreciated. I just want to feel like I did before taking the mecicine because I felt 100 times better than I do now.

"Hi there, I was bumped up to 30mg from 15mg as I got myself in a total mess with the doses and coming off my citalopram. Bad care and support from docs. Had all sorts of symptoms mainly dizzy and wiped out, which I thought was normal. I wasn't sleeping and my anxiety was worse than before I started taking anything. I wanted to come back down to 15 mg so had a chat with the doctor and said what I was doing. I took 22.5mg one day and 30mg the next, for 2 weeks and was tapering like that. After 2 weeks I thought I'll split them further and take 26.25mg every day instead of different doses every other day, as I thought that was better. But after 2 and half weeks the withdrawal symptoms hit me like a truck. Properly wiped out, painful shoulders and back, dizzy, anxious, clenching my hands and teeth, shaking, feeling hyper, and when I'm not super tired I can feel very angry. On the odd day I feel like I'm losing my mind. Utterly horrible. Plus my appetite is all over the place and I felt sick a few times. I've been off work for over a week now and going in when I can.
It's been 4 weeks since I dropped the dose to alternate days and 2 weeks since I went on 26.25mg. My shoulder and back pain isn't as bad, and I feel I'm better than I have been but I can feel fine one day and then have to phone in sick the next. It's actually making me more depressed with the symptoms I have.
My question is, can someone reassure me that this will eventually stabilise? I'm worried I'm not back to normal yet and when I've changed dose before it usually takes about 4 weeks. It can be rocky but usually fine for work and can cope.
I woke this morning with palpitations, so still in bed hoping to get into work later today. I contemplated going back up to 30mg but that would probably be a step backwards considering I was only on 30 for a month. I'm glad my friend and my family have helped me to stay on the same dose as any change is really sensitive to me.
I'm really struggling atm and worried about my work. Will I stabilise over the next week or so? Please help!
Many thanks
Dan

"Originally, I was prescribed Mirtazapine 15mg because anxiety was making it extremely difficult for me to sleep. Now, I cannot deny that Mirtazapine helps me sleep (it puts me out like a light), but does anyone else feel, if they didn't set an alarm or literally drag themselves out of bed, they would sleep they entire day away? And, also, when I am awake, I feel like all I am dying is yawning and rubbing my eyes - has anyone else experienced this?

"Hi
There was a very interesting article in the Daily Mail yesterday about thecommon misdiagnosis of depression when it may be adult ADHD. If the latter then treatment required is drugs to boost dopamine eg atomoxetine, not SSRIs such as mirtazapine,which would have no effect and could make things worse. Google ""adult ADHD"" and youll get a link to the article.
Hope this helps in some cases.

"What is the best dosage of mirtzapine for anxiety? I've been on 15mg once a day at bedtime for 5 months now and I feel it's starting to lose its edge. The sedative effect if had on me wore off after the first week at 15mg. but I was feeling better on it. I don't want to stop taking it I just want to find the right dosage to help with my severe anxiety. I've tried other SSRI's and I'm not a fan of them at all, this has been the best thus far and I'll also occasionally have to take Ativan at .5mg once a day, but not every day, more so recently because it seems my mirt is losing its effect or plateauing on me and I don't want to go in reverse! I suffer from severe anxiety, I worry about everything and panic, and also have moderate depression. Wondering what dosage would be best to move up to...? Whether it'd be going straight to 30mg at night or upping to 22.5 at night... Or doing 30mg but splitting them up taking one 15mg at night and next in the morning. Any insight..? Thank you.

"Hi all
Haven't written for a while I'm at exactly 1 month from the drop from 45 to 30mg of mirtazapine
Wow what a ride
Withdrawal effects didn't start to week 2 and went like this
Panic attacks upon waking which died down into crippling stomach pains and nausea
Then after a few days the panic attacks stopped but was being woken every morning with indigestion nausea and stomach cramps
Then the morning stomach cramps went was just left will all day nausea
Then i had a few days of feeling pretty good thought it was over
Then at 4 weeks i now having Askethsia this in itself makes ke feel sick, restoess, and like i was to crawl out of my skin. Extremely agitated and genuinely don't know what to do with myself
Tried tiring my legs out with some exercises but i can't seem to do it for long before my legs give way and i have to lay down again which starts off the fidgeting
I've taken a diazipam and not sure if it's helped but don't want to take anymore as am trying to use them only as and when but I'm afraid where this withdrawal has been so severe and I've had to take them i may be addicted
I am going to phone the doc in a bit as have very little control over my legs and can't drive
Has anyone else had this as part of withdrawal I've done some research and have found that mirtazipine has commonly been used to treat ssri induced Askethsia so would make aense to me it would be a symptom of withdrawal
Does anyone know how long this will last? Its making je feel really inpuksive and adgitated which isbaffecting my mood badly
Hooe everyone else is well
Look forward to your comments

"Hey, everyone! 
I'm not sure if you remember me; I posted a topic a while back when I was first starting Mirtazapine, and now here I am a month down the line.
I must say, I quite like Mirtazapine. I take it for anxiety, not depression, and because I was having trouble sleeping. Now, as far as putting me to sleep goes, I think they are brilliant. I take one an hour before I am going to bed and I sleep all the way 'til morning. And I have literally suffered no side effects. 
Now, where anxiety is concerned... am I as bad as I used to be? No. I used to work myself into a blind panic; I would cry, I would have panic attacks, I would call the out of hour doctor, and generally be inconsolable. It was awful. Now, I don't get anywhere near that freaked out now, nowhere near it. But I wouldn't exactly say I feel calm either. There is definitely still some anxiety. It's just quieter, haha.
The problem is, I like the mirtazapine cause it helps me sleep, so I am not entirely sure what to do.

"i haven't been here for a while as i was waiting to see how my taper will play out. After reinstating .95 mirt in beginning of March, after severe nausea and insomnia and anxiety, i continued it for 5 weeks. i was feeling pretty o.k. only i had severe joint pains. had a bout of flu. then i started taking it on alternate days for 4 weeks. it also was o.k. buti had more depression and some anxiety. but still slept good. No nausea this time. but had the flu again. Then i switched to liquid mirt by dissolving it. i followed the method mentioned here. I took it everyday for a week. this was a disaste for me. i am having terrible insomnia. havent slept 4 days in one week. Horrible depression in the mornings. it is wierd because i have this horrid depression only when i sleep. the days i don't sleep i have no depression in the morning. but i am so exhausted. I am so confused. i don't know what's going on with me. The little spark of life that was coming back , which mirt stole from me, has now disappeared again. Can anyone relate to this. now i am back to cutting mirt into tiny pieces. i don;t even know how much they are. But thankfully i have no nausea this time around. But constant morning anxiety and depression. i would be glad to have any advice. or even if you could share your tapering experience. on worst night i take .5 mg of Lorazepam and that helps me. But i don;t want to take it regularly for fear of addiction. One thing i found out was, liquid mirt was making me more depressed and also causes insomnia.

I cannot higher the dose because what ever mg I am on it has the same effect makes me as ill. that is the reason I have to come off them.They dont stop the panic attacks they have made them worse
I really dont know what to do any more,I some times wonder if it is all worth it.
I have a small supply of valium but taking them is another hurdle to climb
and at the moment I am not strong enough to do that.

"This is my first post on the forums so I'm hoping you can help me.
I've been on 30mg mirtazipine for about 3-4 months and the weight gain is making me very depressed. I have an eating disorder - EDNOS but with a real problem with bingeing and purging. The mirtazipine has increased my appetite - it gives me the munchies at night which leads to horrible bingeing, and it's also made it impossible to lose weight. It's making me feel horrible. I'm going to ask my consultant to reduce the dose because I desperately want to be off it.
My question is - how bad is the withdrawal, and how much weight did you lose when you came off it (in kgs if possible)? I'm also on 225mg venlafaxine, 450 pregabilin and 200 lamotrigine, so I'm wondering whether the withdrawal symptoms will be easier because of all the other meds?
Thanks in advance!

"When I first started Mirtazapine, a little over a month ago, I actually posted a topic on here singing its praises, telling anyone that would listen how wonderful it is. At the time I had been suffering from insomnia due to health anxiety, and was constantly in this overly emotional state due to exhaustion. Eventually, I gave in and started 15mg of Mirtazapine. I slept like a baby, so of course I thought it was great.
I'm now a little over a month down the line, and I'm starting to change my opinion on Mirtazapine. I don't feel it is helping my anxiety, and I am beginning to think it is helping me sleep a little too effectively. Like, it really knocks me out. I went to sleep last night at 3am (that is kind of normal for me), and didn't wake up this afternoon until 4pm. Sometimes, I wake up feeling heavy headed and a little bit groggy, despite all the sleep I am getting.
And, last of all, I am not sure it is doing much for my anxiety. I have health anxiety, so I am constantly freaking out that there is something seriously wrong with me, even when multiple tests and examinations beg to differ. Now, I don't know if Mirtazapine is CAUSING the symptoms I am suffering from, or just not helping with the anxiety brought on by this symptoms, but I am as on edge as ever I was. I am having this weird shocks, or like crawling sensations, inside my head, and it constantly freaks me out, due to my health anxiety, that it is a brain tumor.
I am seriously considering quitting Mirtazapine; can anyone else share their experiences with me? I'm only 27, and I only started taking meds a month ago, so this is all very new to me. Any advice that can be offered would be massively appreciated.

"I was told about the risk of weight gain but told it was more to do with increased appetite than fat binding, etc and that as long as I watched what I consumed I'd be fine.  Roll on six weeks and I have surgery and after a further six weeks I feel enormous but put it down to swelling and post-op ""taking it easy"".  Decide to take control and join weightwatchers to find I'd put on over two stone and am the heaviest I've ever been.  One week in with little effort I lose 9lb but three weeks in I've regained 2lb and feel huge again.  Only difference, other than increasing my exercise, was that I'd ran out of mirtazapine 30mg five days before the 9lb loss as my repeat prescription failed to materialise and I started again the day after.  Can weight loss and gain be that rapid be purely down to the mirtazapine?  Having a history of bulimia I am tempted instead to ditch the pills, lose the weight and take the chance that withdrawals are not too catastrophic.  Certainly won't miss the twitchy left eyebrow either!

"Hi there I've been suffering from severe anxiety and depression for close to a year now. I had two pretty serious episodes in my early 20s and was on citalopram for over ten years until I started to decrease the dose a few years ago. I've had a lot happen to me since this time including chronic pain, a wedding and subsequent separation plus an operation all in the space of 18 months.

I had a stroke before Christmas.It was a real shock.Fortunately it happened while I was in hospital so I had scan very quickly.
I had been admitted due to severe pain in my leg although it was not dvt.
I was then found to have aterial fibrilation!
I had tapered mirtazapine a few months before this happened and was feeling ok.
Any way following my discharge I had dreadful insomnia and anxiety and knowing the struggle I had to wd in January my GP put me back on 15mg mirtazapine.
To be fair I was so shattered due to lack of sleep and the anxiety was dreadful so I agreed to give it another go.
Also I had lost so much weight and it was hoped that my appetite may improve.
I am still losing weight as my stomach is upset most of the time and I have gone from constipation to 'never off the toilet' sorry, too much informtion!
I feel so weak and just want to sleep.
Tingling in arms and legs and all the horrible things we all suffer due to mirtazapine.At first I was putting it down to the anti coagulant drug I have to take but as I have started reading the threads again I know it is the mirt and I need to wd.
When I did WD previously I went from 15mg to 7.5 then stayed there for a few weeks then just stopped.I felt dreadful for a few weeks then gradually as mirt left my body I improved.
So back again, my GP is not helpful so I need to do are slow er WD this time.

Then my left shoulder got really tired. then i had difficulty swollowing pills, and hard things like steak and chips and such... it always felt like it was caught in my thoat. about 7 months ago, i felt the same tiggling in my right toe. then i started waking up mostly in the morning not ticking or tremoring, but my arms and hands are starting to jump..... a ton of movement, to the point i cant hit a button. it gets better over the course of the day, only to come back at night. about 3 months ago the tiggling is now in my left leg, where it feels normal till you touch it then it feels numb. ALL my musles are now always tired and sore.

So i don't know if you saw my other thread but since withdrawal from mirt 45 to 30 The panic attacks have stopped and the morning anxiety is dying down
But what i get every morning without fail is the most debilitating stomach cramps
My doc and i both no i have a really high pain threshold but this is crippling me. Not just my stomach but my bowels are kicking right off to, i am immobilised because of it.
I'm living on pain killers which do help.
I just wanted to know if these are part of withdrawal and will they go away in a day or 2?
I can tough it out if that's the case. Everything else ie anxiety and fatigue are wearing off. I'm sticking to this dose for another 2 weeks at least
If the pains don't go away tho i don't know what to do. If mirt is causing all this i want off asap

"Hello,
I have been on Mirtazepine for ~6 months (15mg). Now that I've recovered, on the advice of my GP I've started to taper the dose down. As instructed I've been alternating 15 with 7.5mg for the past five days, and although having encountered no ill effects during treatment (besides some minor weight gain and creeping tiredness the past few weeks) I've now found myself in a situation where I feel very unwell. I wondered if others would be able to share their experience of using this particular tapering routine? I have to say I'm very surprised that I'm having symptoms at all when still taking full doses every other day? Namely I have been having trouble sleeping, my joints and muscles ache, I have headache from waking until early afternoon, my thinking feels foggy, and the most troubling is severe nausea. I keep waking in the middle of the night with chills and feeling extremely sick, although I never actually vomit. I've continued to feel run down and sick all day, and my appetite has declined. I feel lucky that so far I haven't had any mental health related symptoms besides feeling temporarily anxious in the morning, but I am concerned where this could lead... Do these symptoms sound related to the dose reduction? How long might I expect this to last? I'm on this tapering routine for the next 2.5 weeks until I reduce it further. Any insights would be much appreciated! Thank you.

"Have been on mirtazapine for 6 years and the last 3 have been pure hell!
They worked to start with was put on them after birth of daughter because i wasn't sleeping making me depressed.
Tried sertraline but made insomnia worse.
First 3 years they worked great either on 30 or 45 depending how i was at at the time.
Then 3 years ago i increased to higher dose within 7 weeks I had my first full blown panic attack! Never ever had one before.
My oartner at the time called an ambulance we both thought i was having a heart attack! I was a very chilled laid back bubbly girl whocould handle pretty much anything.
I dealt with my problems and whoever else needed my help I'd take it all in my stride. I had no reason to panic and still don't now. Didn't occur to me that it could have been the meds causing this
Quite the opposite. That maybe i was really ill and I needed them more than ever.
The paramedics told me that it was just a panic attack but I was first one in the docs the following morning.
My usual doc was on a sebatical so had to see stand in. She gave me diazipams and told me to relax and see how I feel. They helped but id be wakingbthrough night with attacks
Whichbi found impossible to calm down from. I was scared! Why was this happening to me?
Doc said i think youre on wrong meds and cross tapered mirt with citalopram. Long story short I got much much worse. How i still functioned I dont know.
Thingd did calm down a bit on 30nof mirt and 40 of citbbut not much panicking daily only think that helped was alcohol.
I was afraid to take diazipams due to addiction. Wt? I remember the days I used to taoevthese for fun?
Cit made my belly bad. So weaned myself off those felt a bit better so struggled through for 6 months using diazipams if i got too bad. Wasn't having full blown panic attacks just terrible morning anxiety which carried on low through the days.
Started to hate diazipams because of sedating effects I wanted to be able to get on with things as it made me feel better. I was getting quite frustrated. Not depressed. I wasn't scared to go out and do anything just didn't have the energy for it.
So went back to doc who increased my dose back to 45. Within 7 weeks BAM!! Id been set back 3 years.
So finally think weve got to the root of it. But now having to withdraw. I keep my focus on that I can already seeing great improvment already. Ie no panic attaks or anxiety spikes and the ones ibdo get are manageable and down to withdrawal.
I thought id start this thread now to see if 1 anyones experienced anything simular/or is expierencing it now! 2 to gain support from people who understand.
I will check in regularly to help supprt anyone who thinksbi maybe able to helpnand let you know how withdrawal process is getting on
Currently on 30 mirt day 9 of reduction from 45.
Pahic attacks have stopped and anxiety spikes have dropped. Diazipams help when needed. Tried propranolol but they kade me tired flat and depressed.
Have a headache and feel sick but if i lay still I'm fine. Funny though in the evenings i feel instantly better after taking my mirt. Like a sense of calm.
Anyways thanks if youve made it this far and look forward to hearing your views

"Hey, guys! I'm not sure if any of you know what the condition mentioned in the title is, but I think there is a possibility that I may be suffering from it, and that it might be Mirtazapine that is causing it. So, I am going to tell you what's been happening, to see if perhaps anyone can relate.
So, I have been taking Mirtazpine 15mg for about... let's say a month, give or take a day or two. I take it for anxiety, more specifically health anxiety. I got myself very anxious towards the end of last year, when I very foolishly googled symptoms I had been suffering from, and had myself on death's door. Ever since, I have been a bit of a wreck.
So, I started taking Mirtazapine because anxiety was keeping me awake, and my GP told me that Mirtazapine was good because it helped with sleep issues. Originally, I had been offered sertraline, but I refused to take those because I heard horror stories about it. So, the Mirtazapine has been great for my sleep issues, but it really knocks me out and sometimes I wake... maybe even after 10 hours sleep... and I feel, not necessarily groggy, but I'm not exactly skipping around with the joys of summer time, either.
Now, on this site, I'm also frequently lurking around on the anxiety board, checking my symptoms with other anxiety suffers, before it reaches a point where the white coated orderlies are coming to take me to my padded cell. And, please, keep in mind that I have health anxiety, so the slightest twinge anywhere in my body sends me off the boil - I'll think I have cancer, or a brain tumor, or a heart condition, it's horrible and often feels as if it's consuming me.
Now... my recent fear has been brain tumors, because I have been having his feeling in the top of my head. I wouldn't call what I feel ""pain"", but it definitely isn't pleasant. It's just this really strange feeling - I don't know whether to describe it as pressure, or as pain, or as a burning sensation. Now, I have my hair shaved off, so I can feel around head, quite easily, with my hands. There is no pain on the exterior of my head. If I were to liken it to something, as ""out there"" as it sounds, it's like someone is poking something into my brain, in this one particular area. People tell me it might be a tension headache, but I'm not entirely convinced that it is.
I recently heard, though, of a thing called scalp dysesthesia, which has its own wiki page, which mentions anti-depressants. 
Has anyone else experienced this?

"Last night started week 10. If you are preparing for, or are just starting mirt wd, I would like to pass along a little advice. From the researce that I have done from every source that I could find. First, the other members here most of all, and then other sites. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to what to do, other than common sense. I have seen people who had tapered for over a year, still going through hell, and others who say that they are symtom free after a cold turkey stop. There are too many withdrawal symptoms to remember, and how can you be 100% sure that what you are feeling is coming from your body wanting it's mirtazapine back? I have had some awful, horrible feelings since stopping cold turkey off 7.5 mgs. And the anxiety has made me afraid at times that I was/am having some serious health issue not related to wd. There have been 2 ER trips, 2 AM crying spells, and unrelenting worry. The wonderful folks on this site have kept me from being in the mental ward at the hospital, as I had no choice to go off the mirt because of side effects. Please, before making a decision in despair that you normally wouldn't make, get with someone here asap and talk it out. Doctors? My doctor seemed to think that withdrawal ends when the medicine is out of your system, when in fact, the definition of withdrawal is withdrawing from something that was previously there. In this case, our brains want the chemical back that it was using to run our nervous system, our bodies, and it is letting us know with the awful, terrible way that it makes us feel. I'm no expert, and there are several on here that have made the trip all the way, which I haven't. And they are the sources that are priceless. David

"I'm not sure what's happening to me this evening but I've hit an indescribable low. It's almost identical to what I experienced with fluoxetine. Everything was OK to begin with and within a month or two in, almost overnight, it was if the drug became depressogenic and I had no choice but to stop it cold turkey and recover for a few weeks.
A similar thing is happening now with mirtazapine. I'm about a month and a half in, started waking up in states of panic - and now of this evening, I'm feeling suicidal. But for a little while there, like with fluoxetine, things were OK.
My plan is to go to my GP first thing - but has anyone else experienced this? And should I take my next dose? The good thing is that it does knock me out.
I think this is largely because I don't think my problems are related to serotonin. The only drug I've had any success with is venlafaxine but I stopped it after a poop out three years later. Those three years were a bit foggy mind you.

"My Dr prescribed me Mirtazapine 4 days ago to treat both insomnia and depression. I started with one 15 MG tablet at bedtime for two days and increased to two 15 MG tablets at bedtime after the initial two days.
So far this med has only made me miserable! Instead of sleeping I feel even more anxious and awake after taking it. I also have been having lower back and hip pain. To top it off the last two days I've had unrelenting diarrhea! !
Can anyone tell me I'd these are""normal"" side effects that will subside once I reach my ""therapeutic"" dosage? I'm ready to throw in the towel, I don't even know that an antidepressant is something I need. M in the past I've NEVER suffered from depression pet say, I HAVE had depressive episodes always brought about by some situation beyond my control (ie; broke my neck in 07 resulting in multiple spine surgeries, followed by divorce and a host of family issues). In the past I've ALWAYS been lucky enough to pull thru sans any medication.
My current got of depression is THE FIRST that's EVER had me seek professional help. My father passed away in July 2014 after a horrible fight with diabetes, heart disease, and PAD, multiple amputations, etc. Prior to his passing I agreed as this primary caregiver for nearly 6 years. .. and my dad was MY VERY BEST FRIEND. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for grief counseling and mentioned having a terrible got off insomnia the last few weeks. .. and here I am.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Btw, I'm in the US, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

"I was initially on[b:59ae1c3308] Mirtazapine[/b:59ae1c3308] (30mg) for 8 weeks for depression and anxiety. And I did start to feel better, although the blurry vision and the derealisation side effects started to make me anxious again. I think the light head was the anxiety not the tablets.
Went back to work and made an appointment with the Doctor to see if there was another antidepressant with no side effects as I didn't think the Mirt was working.
He told me how to gradually come off the Mirtazapine and then to start [b:59ae1c3308]Citalopram.[/b:59ae1c3308] Those days copming off the Mirtazapine were fine and the 3 days I took nothing I felt great again! Well what an awful reaction I had to the Citalopram ! Heart thumping, sickness, mind racing, pins and needles, total insomnia for 3 days and the anxiety attacks were awful! I actually phoned NHS Direct.
When I spoke to the Doctor , he said that I had a reaction and the tablets obvousily didn't agree. In a knowing smile, he said that I should perhaps go back on the Mirt and that I came off them too quickly.
I am now on no medication , but can feel the awful anxiety still there fron the Citalopram episode and am wondering if I will slip back to square one again if I don't take anything. The Doctor has given me a prescription for 15mg 1 week and thereafter 30mg. Perhaps the side effects weren't that bad and as the nurse said \"" only got bothersome because I was feeling better\"".
So I'm thinking that I will go back to the Mirtazapine and perhaps they aren't that bad!

"Hi everyone hope your all well!
I have been on Citlopram for 8weeks now going from 10mg to 30mg. After i found little improvement and still feeling dreadful and along with Citloprams side affects too. I WASstill crying most of the time, thought i was going crazy need i go on. I spoke to my Doctor he said to try Mitrazapine starting at 15mg along with a reduce dose of Citlopram at 20mg. First day with this amount was really strange and a kind of hungover feeling and the following three days seem to get better and better. The racing thoughts had slowed and more importantly i wanted to get up amd actually get dressed. I was in a great mood and thought finally the old me was on its way back. What a relief for my mom and partner!!. Started to make plans as to when i thought id be getting ready to go back to work holidays etc etc. On the 4th day my doctor told me to reduce the Citlopram to 10mg and increase the Mitrazapine to 30mg. The next several days ahead i dippped and dipped even futher in to a low low mood. After the CPN visited and i got upset not understanding as to why id had these great days and then dipped. The Doctor rang the next day and i explain how i felt and said he would visit the following day. After my visit from the doctor he suggested i tapper down to 15mg Mitrazapine along with sticking to 10mg Citlopram.
HAS ANYONE HAD THIS EXPERIENCED?

"Out of all the symptoms that I have had while withdrawingfrom mirt, the one that has been the worse, and hardest to seem to shake is the abdominal cramps / pain. I am on my third and las time coming off mirt, and each time that I went back on it was because I couldn't deal with the abdominal pains. They cause lack of sleep, fatigue, anxiety, and stress. Each time that I went back on the mirt, all the abdominal symptoms were gone withing a few days. I had to get off the drug the last time because of heart rhythm problems that I was already on heart meds to control. My cardiologist took me off them this time for good. So, going back on the mirt is no longer an option. My question is has anyone had significant abdominal cramps coming off mirt, and if so, how long before any relief? This time I have been off a little over 4 months. Thanks for reading and any response is appreciated. David

Could it be that the meds are not for me.  Did  have a good sleep when I first started on them,  but now taking a while to drop off.  So the sedation has worn off.  Our surgery has changed the appointment system.  They give you a phone consultation. It feels like I'm being rushed when the Doctor rings me and I don't have enough time to ask questions about the meds or even ask about changing to something else.  I always feel better if I can talk face to face.

"In February I had a panic attack out of nowhere, not even sure what trigured it. Me and my wife were putting our 7 month old to bed, I had a little pull feeling in my chest, then out of nowhere I had tightning in my chest, legs turned to jelly and I honestly thought I was having a heart attack. Im 31, never experienced one before, so I didn't know what it was.
So my Wife phoned the hospital and after taking blood, xrays in my heart, ecg and a few other tests, I was told it was just a panic attack and that they believe I had a problem with anxiety.
Now I've always had issues with my head, I saw my first psychiatrist when I was 11, tried committing suicide at 24, was tested for bipolar a few years back and was instead diagnosed with depression.
But the thing is, I have been incredibly happy these last 6 years! I got married to my wife, had a beautiful son and everything has been amazing. Had no depression, anxiety or anything.But out of nowhere, since that panic attack in feb, I have been a complete mess.
The doctor has put me on 30mg of mirtazapine and for the first couple of week, I actually felt ok. But the past 5 days have been hard! I've been getting extremely anxious and getting cold sweats. I can't say I've had thoughts of trying to harm myself, but I have had thoughts that I can't cope with feeling like this and I wish I was dead.
I have told this to my wife and she has said it could be side effects, but if so, will it subside?
I think what's getting me the most, is the fact that this has all hit me out of nowhere and the most confusing part is, I know I have a good life and I'm happy in it, but for some reason at the same time, I'm a complete mess.

He's the one that upsets and is nasty to those around him. But it's just gone too far. I don't believe I'm safe anymore and he won't believe that Mertazapine is the problem.

Blurred vision stomach pain extreme gas, bladder problems back and leg pain I could go on and on. I now have a trapped nerve in my neck which has crippled me (not down to mirt but a recurring problem after a head injury in my 20s) and because I'm on mirt I can't really take any other drug on top to help the pain due to being sensitive to almost every antidepressant they tried! The doc has now said she want to take me off the mirt to see if that's the cause of the symptoms and has told me that I have to take one night then miss one night for the next 2 weeks. This scares the hell out of me as surely this is messing around too much with this. I just want off this drug now as I have no quality of life just pain and dizziness and constant nausea

"I have been off mirtazapine completely for over six weeks after carefully withdrawing. These are not WD symptoms I am having now, but a return to my problems I had before mirtazapine. My insomnia is worse than ever. Even with a sleeping pill I don't get to sleep before 1 am and I am awake again at 6. I am so sleep deprived. But my insomnia returned whilst I was still on mirt, so again nothing to do with WD. I have absolutely no appetite, which is how I was before mirt and I am dropping weight at an alarming rate. I feel weak as a kitten but have a physical job caring for horses, so this cannot go on. This weakness and lack of sleep is going to drive me to depression again if I don't sort it out. But what can I do? I am sure it is a physical problem rather than a mental one. I can't go back on the mirt due to my blood counts and kidney problems. Any ideas? I think this is how my depression started before; lack of sleep and feeling so hungry but unable to eat.

"Can anyone give me a schedule on how they reduced the dosages. The folks on this board seems inwilling to do so. They seem very vague on the specifics. Cmon folks, help someone out. Because most doctors are too scared to help. (Liability issues) its a sad state iof affairs we have in the US.

Her BM management improved greatly. She was on the 30 mg for 4 months before we tapered. I kept her at 15 mg for a month, then we went to 7.5 for two weeks, then to 3,5 for two weeks.

The doctors put her on this terrible drug because she wasn't eating. Ok, I will admit, after a while she began too eat. She's been eating just fine since tapering. The doctors never really though she had depression. But, after all she had been through, who wouldn't be depressed? But I think another, non lethal, appetite enhancer should've been used.
This is just one of many issues we had with drugs that were given to her hastily.
The other was Keppra. That was a pure, and unnecessary, nightmare that we finally stood up agains, after much dansge was done. Another story for another day ..,

"Ok after being on 22.5mg for 3 months and not coping with the awful dizzy feeling all day and stomach problems I went down to 15mg a week past Sunday but I have noticed a huge drop in my mood back to feeling very depressed. Is this because I went down a dose or is it pooping out on me. I had been doing very well apart from side effects it was helping depression. Is it just my body adjusting to the lower dose. I don't want to go messing around anymore with this drug. Please help I dont want to be back to square one again. I have doctors on friday

"Hi, I was on  clonazepam last year summer for about 4 months .5mg. The doctor told me to stop becouse I was getting bad anxiety attacks from it. Before I went in this med. never had any depression or anxiety. So I stop e cold turkey.  Than they put me on remeron 7.5 mg in Oktober and after a month I started to get brain zap. I new that this is not a med for me. So I started to taper off (way to fast) and stopped after 2 monts.

"Hi
I have suffered from anxiety for many years worrying about things over which I have no control which often led to a viscious cycle effect.I have a stressful job and home life and have often felt completely overwhelmed by everything going on. In the worst times I would go for almost 3 days without sleep until my body would just shut down and sleep would kick in. Ive been prescribed zopiclone and diazepam in the past which certainly helped but  found i did struggle concentrating at work when using diazepam.Anyway I must say that the zopliclone has been great for sleep problems and I have managed to be in control of it rather than it of me. I was concerned about what I read about quickly becomong dependant on zopiclone and the potentiial viscious circle of it becoming less effective with over use and the insomnia rebound effect of trying to come off it,so Ive just been taking one 7.5 mg zopliclone usually on a friday and sat night to ""catch up"" with lack of sleep for the rest of the week. Ive recenlty had a  bad bout of anxiety however and my doctor has put me on 15mg mirtazapine once a night before bed. Im on my third day now and I must admit it seems to be doing a great job.Sleeping well and anxiety is much better...its almost as though an anxiety switch in my brain has been flicked off. I can put things into perspective now and Im not stressing about things outside my control which would previously overwhelm me and almost stop me being able to function on a day to day basis. The only downsides so far are headaches...not awful but ""nagging"" although Im told they should hopefully pass after the first week...and also a lack of being as alert as one would normally be. However those seem a small price to pay for the general benefit of feeling far more relaxed and peaceful.Early days but if mirtazapine continues to work like this Im happy to stay on it for years to come. I think that what I thought were anxiety attacks have actually been primariily caused by depresssion although I appreciate the two are linked.
One other odd side effect I shoud comment upon is that mirtazapine seems to have significantly desensitized me to pain and I wondered if anyone else has experience this with this drug? I was training in the gym earlier today and felt far less pain when weight training than previously,my body feeling totally numb,Very odd. Anyway good luck to anyone who starts on this drug.I will report back in a week or so with an update when hopefully the headches will have stopped.You also do feel very sleppy when first taking mirtazapine but again hopefully that should wear off after the first week or so,

"Hi
I was on 15-30mg mirtazapine for about a year for depression. I quit the drug almost 6 months ago more or less cold-turkey. 15-0 mg in 2 weeks.
However, ever since I've had problems with my stomach, it's constantly rumbling, and I mean constantly. Making weird noises and creating gas.
I did check if I had lactose/gluten intolerence, but I didn't.
However I do have extreme anxiety from time to time and also overall generalized anxiety, I can feel my chest/stomach muscles are really tight. Could this be the cause? Usually I get a sense when i worry more, the stomach gets worse.
Please help me out, I'm even starting to think mirtazapine created a permanent damage on my stomach, which honestly seems very far fetched.
Thanks

"This is my second day on this med and up until taking it I was really worried about the weight gain aspect of things. At the mo I'm still feeling the brain zaps of the last drug I was on, a little bit washed out. That was Venlafaxine which was great for all of 12 months then gradually pooped out. I stayed on the lowest dose but noticed myself sinking into this lethargic depression quickly; I was crying here and there, I quit volunteering, my bed was my sad cosy place perched on a cliff of %(£"" ...
So far I've noticed the Mirtaz gently knocks me out after an hour of taking it. Vivid dreams ensue and if I get up during the night my balance is akin to being on a bouncy castle. Otherwise, I've been getting out of bed and doing stuff earlier (which is probably a good sign). In fact I'd say if it wasn't for night-time sedation I'd think I wasn't taking anything it all - I think I've become a little used to the unpleasant effects of venlafaxine.
Anyway. I'm curious as to what to expect on these. As I said, I've heard they're awful for weight gain and sugar/carb craving. I'm not sure if it's the power of suggestion but yesterday I walked into town for brownie mix and had to fight myself from tasting more of the cooked gooey result. That and I've generally felt colder which would make me think that my metabolism has crashed.

"Hiya...... wrongly or rightly I'm on day 3 of doing cold turkey.
I've been on Mirtazapine for only 3 months at 45mg...
Sadly the side affects (2 stone increase and inability to move hips, knees, ankles, twist etc) were unbearable and sadly my gp was one focusING on my anxiety which has significantly reduced.
However, side effects were debilitating in themselves..... so I decided to go it alone.
I'm on day 4 .... no mirtazapine at all. The insomnia has crept back in, I've had flu like symptoms and an upset tummy.... slight moments of paranoia and panic
...
However, I'll go see my gp at day 7 and see if there's a need to go onto something else as the Mirtazapine is well out my system I'm guessing....
Clearly this isn't a recommended way of doing things hut sadly my GPS only action to to continually increaee dosage or suggest I'm not allowing the drug time enough to work....
Sure there's a better drug that doesn't cripple u with weight increase on a BIG scale or cause your joints to hurt so badly you scream out in pain just sitting on the toilet.

"Hi all again ... ok iv been on mirt since end of Nov started on 15 then up to 22.5. It helped my depression really well but the side effects I'm having are having a huge effect on me. I was wondering if anyone else has any or is it something else. The dizziness I know is a side effect but tits to the point that I'm stuggling when I leave the house and at work I'm struggling I actually feel drunk and a few occasions I've felt I'm going to faint. My appetite fluctuates I've never been one to eat much through the day but could eat the house at night this I know is a side effect although I needed to put weight on. My main problem is I have ibs but since being on mirt it's getting worse and worse and my stomach is constantly rumbling and having severe gas especially through the night ( I take mirt around 9pm) and I also have a high increase in bladder movements I'm up at least 5 to 6 times needing. I'm tempted to forget a dose tonight and see if I'm any different tomoro. Has anyone any help for me as I don't see doctor till 8th April! Thank you

"Hey there peeps. I have been on mirtazapone for 10 years of so, gradually increasing dose over that time. I'm currently on 60mg daily. In sort, it's been very effective for me, but over time symptoms (depression and GAD) return and so an increase in dose gets me back on track. I'm a bit worried though, about going beyond 60mg, and wondering if anyone else has done this and whether you have any advice?

"I'm hoping that someone could hep reasure me, I'm pretty scared. I have suffered anxiety attacks in the past but I managed years without them. Due to stress at college my anxiety was starting to creep up although I was managing. The docs gave me 50mg of setraline to try, I was on them for 3 days and they made me so ill, nausea, dihorea, buzzing in my ears, shaking and constant anxiety attacks. The doctor said stopping them after 3 days wouldn't cause any problems however I just kept feeling worse to the point I pleaded to be put in hospital. The doctor then prescribed me 15mg of mirtazapine and I was desperate to feel better. I was on them for 3 days and although I was able to get out my bed I felt extremely drugged and still dealing with panic attacks, I stopped them after 3 nights as i dint want to be stuck on drugs, and was told there would be no withdrawals due to how long I was on them. I felt much better before any of these meds. This is my second day off them, the 1st day I still had anxiety but started to feel better throughout the day but I'm now on day 2 being off them and I feel worse. I feel extremely spaced out, i'm having to constantly battle with panic attacks (I am keeping them at bay) however it's a constant battle. I have had no appetite since this started and have lost over half a stone. I feel totally exhausted even though I am getting sleep. All this seems to be worse in the mornings and throughout the day and easing very slightly at night. Does anyone know if this is normal and how long it will last?

"So I have been off mirtaapine for a month now and I want to let you know what I have observed about weight.
When I gained 20lbs after being on mirtazapine for a while, I started to watch what I ate. It was hard because as you all know, it gives you a huge appetite! Soon just watching what I ate wasn't enough. I used an online calculator which worked out that with my age, height and activity level, I needed 2100 calories a day. So to lose a pound a week I needed to eat no more than 1600 calories a day. Soon it became clear that doing this did not make me lose a pound a week. In fact it was bearly a quarter pound. So I upped my exercise to vigorous cardio every day and finally lost that pound a week. Over the weeks and months, I calculated that the mirtazapine was causing me to need 400 calories less than what all the online calculators said I needed. People who say they gain weight on mirt even though they are not eating any more than before, are telling the truth. It is not just the cravings that make you put on the weight.
Anyway, as I tapered off the mirt, the cravings stayed with me until I reached just 5mg a day. But I still needed the same amount fewer calories a day to maintain my weight. This effect stayed until two weeks AFTER I came off the mirt. I was still gaining weight as soon as I ate normally!
Then suddenly, three weeks after being free of mirtazapine I am losing half a pound a day, without even trying. I have no nausea causing this and am actually consuming close to 3000 calories a day. Yesterday I had 3 chocolate bars and still lost weight. I work very hard physically mucking out horses etc, so need a lot of calories, yet on mirt I actually only needed 1800 calories to stay the same weight when working out every day plus doing the horses. That's a difference of 1200 calories! No wonder so many people gain weight on mirtazapine.

Previously I had been taking sertraline but was switched to 15mg mirtazapine as the doctor said it would help me sleep. I am absolutely shattered and feel more anxious than ever. I do feel that my body is lethargic and in the mornings it takes a lot of effort to get up but my head just doesn't seem to switch off. In fact I feel like my body is disconnected from the rest of my body.

"Hello, everyone!
I'm new to the site, literally just registered, haha.
So, recently, I have been suffering from anxiety, and that anxiety is giving me awful sleep problems. I have been taking herbal sleeping pills, which certainly help me drift off, but I wake early and very rarely feel refreshed. I went to my GP on Monday, with a list of things I have been suffering with (sleep issues, aches and pains, slight nausea, trouble concentrating, brain fogginess), and she said she felt all of these issues are being brought on by my anxiety. Now, before she prescribed me Sertraline, but something about them didn't sit right with me, so I didn't take them. Now, I have Mirtazapine, 15mg, and really all I want them for is to help me get a good night's sleep, and to stop my stupid brain from tormenting me all day, every day, haha! I don't have depression, at least not that I know of, so it did worry me slightly that this drug is classed as an anti-depressant, it is also prescribed for insomnia and anxiety? If my GP is lying to me, I'mma have to fight her!!! :P
But, really, guys, I appreciate any info you can give me. Another thing I am worried about is how affectively they work. I have a job, so if I take one of them a night, I'm not at risk of not waking when my alarm goes off or anything, am I?
- do they work?
- what side affects do they cause?
- have you been on them long term?
- is it easy to wean yourself off them?
I have been reading through other topics on here, and you all seem lovely, so I am looking forward to hearing from all of you.
Kind regards,

just coming for advice. Have been on straight mirt for 2.5 weeks now after cross tapering with 50mg sertraline for a week. Had spent previous 3 weeks reducing sertraline from 200mg.
came off sert because of terrible anxiety and poor sleep.
still haven't had full nights sleep on mirt...waking up every 1.5 hours, but usually back to sleep within 15 mins. But very drowsy and woozy throughout the day. Exhausted and no energy. Feel drunk. Have put on about 5lbs but no change in appetite. Very weepy and having sobbing fits....haven't done that since put on sert.
have barely been out of house for 3 weeks. Have been off work 3 months now and desperate to get meds sorted and back on track.

"I thought I would start a new thread to give people tips for coming off this drug. I have gained so much advice and support from people on here and I owe my (so far) painless withdrawal to them. People like Calmer and Betsy, and plenty others too. I have been on 30mg mirtazapine for four years. I tried to come off them a couple of years ago and failed miserably, returning to my full dose after 10 days of awful anxiety and insomnia, as well as migraines and nausea. I had cut my dose to 15mg for a week and then dropped to zero.
This time I read every thread on here about mirtazapine withdrawal and started off really slowly, cutting down by just 3.75mg for two weeks. Then by a further 3.75 mg. At the same time I started taking a lot of inositol. I take a huge heaped teaspoon in my tea every morning. I had only slight nausea when I first started dropping my dose but I think that was me getting used to the inositol. Once I was down to 22.5mg of mirt, with no withdrawal symptoms, I figured I could go a bit faster and dropped my dose down to 15mg. I had no withdrawal symptoms after ten days and so have now dropped my dose to 11.25mg. I use a simple pill cutter from ebay to cut my tablets. So I am now on three quarters of a 15mg tablet. Mirtazapine had pooped out on me and so I already have terrible insomnia. I take temazepam some nights and benadryl on others to help me with that.
I will post my progress here. Who knows, I may fail miserably, but whatever the outcome, I hope it will help others. I was terrified of coming off mirtazapine, but now I am excited by it. I think the key is to take it really slowly and work out the pace your body can cope with. The smaller your dose goes, thee smaller the decrease in your dose should be. Good luck everyone, and please post your own experiences here. I know some people have really suffered despite coming off mirt very slowly. Everyone is different and I think everyone's experience can be a real help to others.

"Around three weeks ago i was prescribed 15mg of Mirtazapine for one week and then after seven days up it to 30mg, (persistant insomnia and depression). Everything seemed to be going ok until 4 nights ago when i became aware of a niggling (not severe headache), i took my 30mg nightly dosage and went to bed, what happened over those following three days i can only describe as the most frightening experience i have ever had.
After around 30 minutes or so my airways started to wheeze constantly and causing me to cough uncontrollably, this inturn drove the air out of my lungs and for the life of me i was struggling to breathe in, it seemed i could only breathe in a tiny amount and this made the coughing worse, this started on a friday evening so i basically had to put up with it all weekend, it got worse, rapidly worse, by the time Sunday came around i had had very little sleep and the suffocation issues were so scarey that for the first time in my life i thought i was going to die of asphixiation (im 49), late sunday afternoon i decided that i would haul myself to the local store (bear in mind its 100 yards away and the whole experience to get there and back due to severe breath shortage was just over half an hour), something in my mind told me to buy an over the counter anti-histamine type pill (Piriteze), after returning home i took one as per packet instructions and within an hour my breathing returned to something like normal.
That was yesterday, i took another piriteze today (not took Mirtazapine since Friday night/ early hours Saturday morning, anyhow after a trip to the doctors today he has told me to recommence with Mirtazapine but not to exceed 15mg, ive done as he said but in my minds eye after the weekend ive had im a little nervous to say the least that i get a repeat of the suffocation, im just wondering if any others out there have had the same experience.

"Hi there
I've been in Sertraline for quite a few years now and felt they had just stopped working. I was prescribed Mertazpine and told to reduce my Sertraline by half for 2 days and then half again for a day or two then start the Mirtazapine. I did this and had my first 30mg dose last night. This morning I couldn't not wake up properly and have no energy and feel terrible.
I'm now thinking I felt better on the Sertraline. Would it be ok to just go back to them say tomorrow? I can't take Mirtazapine if this is how it makes you feel - I have children and a job. Any advice greatly appreciated.

"I am just about to start my 3rd 10% reduction dose from 30mg Mirt which is slightly under 19mg which I plan to take for 2 weeks. I have to say 'so far so good' That said, I am already stressing because all that I read seems to point towards problems coming further down the line eg 7.5mg etc. Please could someone advise if this is likely. Also today I read that someone reduced to 15mg and has already started losing weight (I have gained and need to shift almost 3 stones gained since starting 30mg around 18 months ago)
I remember reading that weight doesn't start moving until the dose is below 15mg. Once again, advise please. Many thanks.
Apart from the weight gain this drug suits me well, if I thought I could reduce the dose and achieve weight loss I would settle for that. At least 2 stones of this weight has to go, it is proving detrimental to my health in many ways and makes me so lethargic. I feel as though I am wearing a suit of armour made of fat.

"Hi there, I've just started on 45mg of Mirtzapine at 8pm last night for bad anxiety and depression. I fell asleep at 9pm which was great because I haven't been sleeping. I woke up twice to go to the loo but nearly lost my balance on the way. I woke up at 6am (which was a major struggle) to get my children off to school. After about 15 minutes I felt alright and thought I can do this. Then while driving I almost fell sleep. I was soo tired still. I got back home after dropping the kids to school and went back sleep at 8am and didn't wake up till 1.30 pm. Is this normal? I'm going to keep going on them for a few days to see how they go.

"Hi,
I've been off mirt for 5 days.
I did everything by the book - 1.5 years to come off Anafranil and mirt. Things weren't so bad but now I'm in extreme anxiety, perhaps panic. I don't understand if this is a withdrawal symptom or back to being anxious again - although I don't remember being so anxious before taking meds.
Can anyone who has passed this stage share his/her experience? Really need help! I took a spoonful of inositol a half an hour ago and almost still the same.
Has anyone been at this situation and eventually exerienced the anxiety/panic decreased? Really need some hope here. I have two little children and work full time. Can't afford to lose my mind.

"Hi all,
Some of you have been very helpful with my previous thread about tapering mirt. Thanks!
Well, after 1.5 years of tapering, I'm finally off the two drugs I was on. Not sure what to expect now...
Should I be feeling a big difference soon? Does the substance stay in the body for a while? Will it take time for my body and brain to adjust back to normal?
The main thing that bothered me during tapering was fatigue, drowziness etc. That's already a bit better during the 3 days since the last dose. However, during the last month, including now, I've been extremely irritable, zero patience, a very irritable stomach, and still, if I don't sleep at least 8 hours, can't get through the day. Now, I'm really not sure if this is going back to my old self (let's face it, I started taking the drugs because of anxiety, OCD, etc') or withdrawal symptoms??? Can anyone share his or her experience and shed light on these questions? I'm mainly doing my best to be glad I've finished the process but a bit morr clarity on the future would be helpful and relieving.
Thanks!

After being weaned off sertraline I was started on 15mg of Mirtazapine but quickly felt worse and even more anxious and having panic attacks frequently. Night time brought little relief with horrendous nightmares aswell as night sweats. Shortly after the GP up-ed my dose to 30mg but I almost fear sleeping even though I'm desperate for it as the dreams are just plain awfull and I'm worried that the anxiety will increase.... I've no family or friends to talk to except for my 2 kids who know nothing about my meds and the daily battle I face.... my gp said it would get easier, I hope it does.

"I’ve been on here a few weeks now and contributed to many a post about the drug Mirtazapine and thought it was about time I told my whole story to try and help others.  First thank you to everyone on here who has replied to me or posted their own bits.  It all helps.
 I’m not sure where to begin or where the beginning actually is to be honest.  Maybe it was back in 1999 when I was having problems and first went on anti depressant’s had counseling and was a mess after being blamed for someone else’s suicide.  I turned to alcohol had two attempts at suicide myself.  They tried me on all sorts of anti depressants and the only one that worked was valium.  I say I got through it then by meeting my now wife.  She gave me more meaning and a reason so live than any drug or therapy session ever did.  However 16 years later I’m back on anti depressants.  Or I was and this is where the story actually begins.
 Back in March one morning I couldn’t get up I was so tired.  I had no energy and chest pains.  I had been walking to work 3.5 miles everyday but now I was struggling to do 100 yards.  I changed my diet, cut down on crap and booze and still nothing.  Bad chest pains all day long and although I was breathing fine I didn’t feel like I was getting the benefits of oxygen.  So I went to see my local GP.  They first put me in with the head nurse at the practice.  She sent me for blood tests, lung and respiratory tests and what ever else she could think of.  Everything checked out fine.  I had the best lungs they had ever seen!  But still I was tired and struggling with breathing.  So she referred me to the Dr who said I was stressed and carrying the stress in my chest.  He told me to crack on and get over it basically.  Well at least I wasn’t dead so after making more life style changes, this time to my business which I know had been stressing me out I tried to move on.  I even had a hypnotherapy session and stress relieving massages to try and help.  But nothing. 
 Come September I went back to my Dr and explained I was no better and going on holiday in a weeks time and could he give me something to pep me up for the trip.  He put me on Sertraline a common anti depressant and one the wifes on for her panic attacks.  Four days after taking it I woke in the middle of the night in a right state of panic.  My mind was racing uncontrollably, I was shaking with fear and had no idea what was going off.  It was the worst thing ever and those of you reading this that have experienced it will know what I mean.  I wanted to come off the drugs as I was convinced it was the Sertraline that had caused it as I had not ever had this sort of problem before going on them.  But my wife told me to stay on them as the Sertraline was to stop her having panic attacks.  So I did but they continued every night and on into the morning sometimes lasting hours.  I couldn’t get into see the Dr as it was the weekend and we was going on holiday Sunday night.  I told the wife I couldn’t go.  I was in a right negative place, all I could think about was not being able to get in the taxi, clinging onto the door or freaking out on the plane as soon as they closed the door.  I’m an ex Para so I’ve flown all over the world, jumped out of planes, been shot at, blown up and all sorts of scary sh*it that didn’t bother me till now.  The wife was in a right state.  She was crying and saying we had to go, we wasn’t wasting our money etc.  So I had to man up and begged so valium off a mate to get me on the plane.  I stayed awake all night before we set off and again all night in the hotel at the airport.  The panic attacks only happened at night so I was scarred to sleep.  In the airport I took the valium and calmed down, got on the plane and flew to Las Vegas.  We checked into the hotel and I thought that’s it we are here now, together, safe and the business is shut down for two weeks so no worries.  We went straight to bed and fell asleep.  I woke in the early ours again in a state with the same old song going over and over in my head.  The song was from 1989 called ‘Nothing ever Happens” nothing changes at all, the needle returns to the start of the song and we all sing along as before and we’ll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow.
This and other thoughts where driving me mad.  I went downstairs to the hotel lobby and asked if they had a doctor.  They  didn’t and all they could offer was a first aider.  I needed help and said who I was and where I was from and that I was going to walk out into the road if I didn’t get help.  At that point security grabbed me and to cut a long story short I ended up in a local mental hospital in Las Vegas on a green 72.  Three days on strong drugs that made me just want to sleep.  It was great apart from the food.  I was eventually released into the wifes care and given valium to get me through.  Not enough though as I had to go cold turkey and couldn’t get no more unless I paid $1000 for a doctor to come out an see me and he would have to put me on the next flight home.  So I had to struggle on.  I had already ruined the holiday and didn’t want to make things worse.  It was very hard.  The panic attacks in the night had stopped but I was on edge all the time with anxiety.
 Back home I managed to see my GP straight away and told him the story.  I had stopped taking the Sertraline whilst I was over there so he put me on Amitriptyline.  The next day I went into a violent shaking fit.  I was on my own and couldn’t even open the door to get help for some time.  Eventually I got help and the Dr said I was one of the unlucky people who have bad reactions to the SSRI family of drugs.  So they put me on Mirtrazapine.  This was supposed to help me sleep and calm me down and stop the anxiety.  I couldn’t sleep, was having suicidal thoughts and was feeling no better but was told by a friend who was on it to stick with it as it could take four weeks to kick in.  So I stuck it out till week five when I was to see a NHS shrink.  By now I was feeling worse than ever with anxiety.  I was anxious all day and after a crap nights sleep as soon as I woke up I had to get straight up and occupy my mind or I would lay in bed and destroy myself mentally.  In the whole five weeks I only had one good day when I went out and had a laugh and a joke with the lads, but later that night sitting watching TV within seconds I was a total wreck.  Nothing was working and the Mirt seemed to just make things worse.  I saw the NHS shrink and he put me on Venlafaxine but I had to have tests before I could go on that as theres a strong history of heart problems in my family.  I came off the Mirt and tried the Venlafaxine.  Only took the one tablet and that led to worse than ever side effects with me struggling to breath as my throat was swollen shut.  So the Drs told me to stick with the Mirt and double my dose to one 15mg tablet in the morning and one at night.  I was also told I had GAD general anxiety disorder and that’s what I was being treated for.  This was by the HNS shrink that spent twenty minute with me and didn’t even want to talk about medication.  So I tried the double dose and next day felt so crap all day I missed my mornings dose.  (Footnote, I’m feeling ill as I type this now just thinking about it all).  So that night instead of taking a 15mg Mirt I halved my dose to see what that would do.  For the next few days I felt wonderfull.  Really great and back to my old self.  Then I started to feel anxious through the day again so I decided to quit the Mirt all together.  Again for a few days I felt great.  Then I started to feel sick in the morning and anxious as the day went on.  This always eased by about mid afternoon.  I had by now a good supply of valium and fell back onto it a couple of times.  One day I took two 5mg tablets just to get me through.  I was having up and down days with the morning being bad and afternoons tolerable.  By day eight I was still feeling sh*t and tried another drug they prescribed me Trazodone 50mg.  I think they put horses down with this stuff.  I hated it and the next day I was having the worse suicidal thoughts ever.  Planning to the last detail how to do it but finding fault with every method.  I’ve tried every option on the NHS to get therapy or some sort of counseling but the earliest date I have is the 13th April.  By which time I could be dead.  So I went to see a private shrink a few days ago.  She sat and talked for 2 hours as a free assessment and has diagnosed me as having had a mental break down.  Shes going to work with me without drugs to get better. Fingers crossed.  Today is day 14 off the Mirt.  This morning I woke up feeling fine and went down hill, then ok and then down hill again.  The last three days have really been mixed and a struggle.  I’m at my whits end now and trying so hard to stay off any medication and just telling myself its “JUST IN MY MIND” (JIMM).  This does help but only when I’m busy.  That’s one of the reasons for typing all this up, to stay busy. I’m not sure how much is the withdrawal symptoms of coming off Mirt or even one of the other many drugs I’ve been on.  My last valium was 28 hours ago so maybe its that and not the Mirt.  I’m told by my pharmacist that Mirt only stays in your system for a couple of days and as I was only on it for five weeks it cant be withdrawal symptoms still.  I’m haning in there but only just.

"Hello, I am now 7.5 months since my cold turkey stop from mirt, Feb 27. I am still having nausea, weight loss (30 pounds), weak / fatigue, abdominal cramps / spasms / pain, sleep interruption due to abdominal cramps, headaches, loss of appetite. These aren't as bad as they have been, but are bad enough to keep me in bed most of the time. I go for short walks when I feel that I can. I am also having tremors. I was on mirt 45 for 8 years. Just to let you know how long symptoms can last. I have had a CT of the brain, 2 abdominal CTs, one with contrast, one without. I have been to the hosptal ER 5 times with symptoms that I was afriad was something serious, which is when these tests were done. My GI doctor says that I should get a colonoscopy if the weight loss continues, 30 pounds over 7.5 months, mostly at the beginning of withdrawal symptoms. I am, also having gas pains and bowels churning, and infrequent constipation. If you are in withdrawal, and this sounds like what you are going through, or have gone through, please reply. In addition to anxiety and depression, started at withdrawals, and feelings of doom and despair are causing fear and stress, and already having Irritable Bowel Syndrome, the symptoms are hard to take.

I was doing fine on the 22.5 but my doctor (very young ) said it wasn't a dose she normally prescribed suggested 30mg would be much better to help my depression. Well I've been on this since Friday night and having the most awful anxiety/panic attacks in the mornings which I must add I didn't have before. I'm only just back to work a couple of weeks ago after several months off and I almost didn't make it out of the door it was so bad. I'm hoping it's just body getting used to higher dose but I'm so frightened by these feeling/attacks that I'm tempted to go back to 22.5mg can anyone give me advice as I really want to stick to this drug as I was in a very dark place after my mum died and desperately want my life back thank you

"Hi,
I posted earlier that I am going to be taken my first 45 mg dose of Mirtazapine. I am currently on 30 mg. I have extreme anxiety and probably depression lol. I have always been terrified of medications until family forced me to take them and mirtazapine helps. But I had a loss in my family and it was traumatic and I can't seem to cope very well. So My psychiatrist upped my medication to 45 mg. I am very scared to take it, but I want to at the same time. Just need some reassurance. I am afraid that it will make me feel so groggy like it did when i first started and that it will slow my breathing down when im asleep and make me die. (haha im scaring myself with my anxious what if thoughts).

"I just had to do my third attempt, this one will be the last one, ordered by my cardiologist. I had gone back on 3.75 after trying for 8months of hell. I couldn't take it anymore. Some of you may have remembered it. Anyway, I had to cold turkey off 3.75 after being on it for a little over a month. When I went back on it, it only took 2 days to almost be back to my old self, symptom free. I couldn't believe that those tiny pills could bring me out of the worst despair that I had ever known. However, the good days didn't last, and the heart problems started back that caused the last jump off. That was 27 days ago, and now I am having GI symptoms, not as bad as before, but the palpitations are a real aggravation. Anyone here gone off 3.75? I know that n two people are the same, but I would like to know about how long you had WD from a small, short dose. Thank You, David

"I have been withdrawing from mirtazapine 30mg for the past couple of months and am now down to just over 5mg for the past 6 days. I have been doing really well with no withdrawal symptoms that I'm aware of.
But last four days I have devellopped a stiff neck and persistent headache which doesn't respond to paracetamol. My head is very sore to the touch at the base of my skull on right side like I have really banged it, but I haven't. Now I have a pulsing earache and sore glands right side of neck. Could this be withdrawal from mirtazapine? No fever or rash.

"Hi, I'm still new to Mirtazapine and trying to find a level that works for me. So I just wanted to know what others have found has worked for them?
For about 3 weeks I've been taking 15mg at night before bed. I take it in two doses as I find one can be too stimulating and wakes me up. 
The sedation effect has worn off now but I still feel muddled and find it hard to focus during my day, I'm hoping this will wear off too. I wouldn't feel safe driving like this at all.
What at dose are you on & when do you take it? How does it effect you?

"Hello, I'm wondering if I could get some thoughts on my condition? 
 2.5 months ago, I experienced a full on panic attack (hyperventilating, tingles in my extremeties, heart palpitations etc.) I went to the Emergency Room and eventually calmed down after being given an Ativan (Lorazepam). The next few days, I was fine--I returned to work and felt good. On the fourth day after this occurred, I was at work and felt a weather headache coming on. I took two extra strength tylenols and washed them down with my green tea (which I drink everyday along with a Vitamin B Complex). 15 minutes later, my ears began to ring and I felt disoriented. I began to experience visual snow and thought that I was having another panic attack. Over the next two days, I was in emerge 4 times thinking this; however, these episodes were not the same as the originaly panic attack (marked tinnitus, pale skin colour, visual snow, nervousness due to the condition and recent panic attacks). My ears have now beeng ringing for 2.5 months. I experience pressure in my face/sinuses/head, tinnitus, and the visual snow all the time. My doctor originally prescribed me on Cipralex. I thought that I would try the natural route first (increased exercise, better diet, zero alcohol, L-Theanine, Magnesium--I stopped the Vitamin B Complex thinking that it may have been involved). After another ER visit 3 weeks or so later, I decided that Cipralex was my only choice (even though I was hesitant as the so-called anxiety was only manifesting itself via these physical symptoms). I took Cipralex at 10 mg for the first 21days. The first week was a complete nightmare with Lorazepam being the only reason that I survived. My doctor then increased my dose to 20 mg and I took that for 11 days before finally stopping as the medication was causing me a lot of problems (I had to take lorazepam all the time to function, I had brain zaps for hours at a time in my sleep). My appetite returned after 8 days on Cipralex and my resting heart rate dropped significantly from being in the 80's to the 50's bpm. 9 days ago my doctor switched me from Cipralex to 15 mg of Mirtazapine which I started immediately. I took 10 mg of Cipralex for the first 3 days and then stopped it completely as per his orders. For the first 6 or 7 days on Mirtazapine, I actually felt good. I was sleeping better, the volume on the tinnitus was way down. Then on day 7, I had a total meltdown--could not stop crying over nothing, felt depressed, felt like I got hit by a bus (flu-like symptoms), shivering with chills and sweating in my sleep, pressure headaches, mild dizzyness. Where Lorazepam was working previously, it was not for these feelings leading me to believe that they are withdrawal from the Cipralex. That's fine, I can endure the withdrawal. The problem is that now that I'm on day 10 of Mirtazapine (7 days removed from Cipralex) the tinnitus volume is back up along with the visual snow. I guess I'm wondering that now that I'm between Cipralex and Mirtazapine actually kicking in and working, is it still anxiety that is causing the visual snow and tinnitus? I fear that the anti-depressants are not working for this condition and this might be something else? Has anybody ever experienced tinnitus and visual snow constantly? I don't feel panic with it anymore and it seems to get worse at completely random times. Do you think that I should just continue with the Mirtazapine to give it an honest go at it as well? What if the Mirtazapine doesn't help this either? I can endure a lot (and have been for over 2 months now) but I'm really worried that my condition is something else. I guess the trial and error is necessary in making a diagnoses but it sure is a long and difficult road to this point. If anybody has any sort of ideas about what could possibly be wrong with me, I would greatly appreciate your thoughts. I strongly feel that the tinnitus and visual snow are the manifestation of the same problem via the auditory and visual senses. Are they somehow related to the original panic attack? Are they the result of taking two tylenols with a green tea?Whether it is anxiety is where understanding stops and again I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read this and provide your thoughts. Thank you.

"Been on 30mg Mirt for over a year and have decided to start a very gradual withdrawal. Mt Doctor has said she wants Psych to start me on an AD which won't add weight as Mirt has. (2 1/2 stone which has to go) could anyone advise me a what point in the withdrawal that a new AD is introduced as I have to pay each time I see him and want to go at the right time. Also, does anyone have any advise on which replacement would be good. I have to say that this medication has suited me in every way apart from horrendous weight gain.

"Hi. I've been taking 15mg of Mirt for about 3 weeks now. I started on it because of severe anxiety and sleeplessness. To begin with the sedation secondary effect work from the first dose, it not only helped me sleep but stopped my daytime anxiety as well. But now three weeks on the sedatry effect seems to have gone and the last few days I've gone back to being very anxious.
I figure I'm at the point where my own chemistry is adjusting to the new chemicals and I'm going through that 'worse before better' period. So i wanted to hear other's experiences during this transition period. What was it like for you? How long did it last? Etc.

She recommended 30mg Mirtazapine which worked amazingly well. Stayed on 50mg Sert as well. She gave me some leeway in finding the best 'balance' in the medications and trusts that I won't do anything too drastic.

Has anybody found a good balance between Mirt and another antidepressant that doesn't make them gain weight rapidly and yet keeps the horrible anxiety way? Also how did you introduce the second med without side effects? Or has anyone found that 15mg of Mirt on its own is enough to keep it away (if I tapered down more slowly)?
Thanks for any help. Just need a good balance that I can stay on long term.

"I had my dose of Mirtazapine increased from 15 mgs to 30 mgs three weeks ago. I am starting to feel less depressed, but I have developed really bad insomnia. I fall asleep quickly, but I wake up two - three hours later and can't get back off to sleep. I have been given Temazapam (reluctantly), but haven't taken it for a couple of nights now, because I feel quite drugged the next day. So there seems to be a choice: sleep very poorly and feel exhausted but with-it (ish), sleep with the aid of Temapazam and feel drugged. I'm getting to my wit's end with it all. Do I reduce the Mirtazapine?
I'm also angry. I feel that those of us with mental health problems don't get the treatment we deserve. Can't get a doc appt until 7 Dec, but will get on the phone Mon am and badger them. I also want to be referred to a psychiatrist.
Hope everyone is doing as well as they can be.

"I no longer need it to sleep anymore and my depression has got considerably  better after quitting but for some reason I am sleeping more heavily than I ever have in my entire life.. I am now using nothing to help me sleep and I can barely open my eyes in the morning and I hallucinate severely at night (I have for a long long tiime, but it's worse now and far more disturbing)..
Is this a side effect of quitting mirtazapine?? I can't tell if I'm ill or it's just because I'm medication free for the first time in a year.. 
I have always been a light sleeper, sleeping about 3/4 hours a night before starting mirtazapine..
I started getting hallucinations about two years ago but since I've quit they are getting stronger and more confusing. I don't know if it all down to mirtazapine???
Has anyone else had this issue??? (The hallucinations are only a night when I settle down btw).

"Dose the amount off mirtazapine you take affect how much weight you gain? I thought I would start a new thread for people wanting answers to a question that so many ask, so that it could perhaps serve as a reference for people searching for an answer to this question when using search engines such as google. I want to invite as many people as possible to add their experiences regarding mirtazapine and possible dose related weight issues.
So my answer to this question is 'yes, to an extent.' I was on 15mg for a month and it was then increased to 30mg for four years. In that period I gained a total of two stone. Most of that happened shortly after increasing to 30mg, although I gained around 6 pounds in the first month whilst I was on 15mg.
I did manage to shift 1.5 stone of it whilst I was on 30mg though, but it was VERY hard. I worked out daily on the cross trainer, and cared for several horses, and walked dogs etc. I calculated that my body only needed 1800 calories a day to do all this. Any more, and I gained weight. And for a 5'10"" woman, that is very little indeed. I reckon that mirtazapine influenced my body so that I needed around 500 calories LESS than I previously needed to maintain weight.
So what happened when I reduced my dose? Well nothing noticable until I was under 15mg. When on 11.25mg I noticed that it was much easier to resist previously tempting treats. I also noticed that I could up my calorie intake by around 200 calories a day, and also not work out every single day, yet still stay the same weight. I am now on 7.5 mg and will have to see if there is further improvement.

"Been on mitrtazipine for four weeksish now. Feel more lively, like I can put my front on to the world again if you know what I mean. Feel like I can cope with feeling sh*t now but I'm having trouble keeping like that. I'll be bobbing along and then something stupid will knock me and then all of a sudden I'll drop really really low. An example, I've just gone back to work after 2 week off. Hubby hadn't done the washing up (not at work) and had gone out instead. He had picked me up from work and stopped at chippy on way back where kids had played up and I had lost it n shouted at them etc, got in saw dirty dishes n lost it. Went mad, really down sulking shouting, argued n felt sh*t n like couldn't cope. Stormed out in wheelchair n hadn't anywhere to go so just walked n walked. Head was spaced out, thinking stupid thoughts, thought bout pushing self in front of car etc. Feel everyone would be better off without me. When get down feel like it hurts too much to feel. I just want to stop feeling. I am short tempered, my poor kids are fed up of me snapping. I'm fed up of them seeing me cry.at work someone upset me n I just wanted to punch them! Obv I walked away but was shaking n upset. I have tried distracting myself, made some Christmas cards and just kept going made loads but all the time thoughts were running
So I guess although hubby thinks I seem more myself they aren't suiting me are They?!

I've been on mirtazapine 15-30mg for about a year for depression. I decided to stop becuase I want to be med-free. I tapered very fast going from 15mg to 7,5 in 1 week and then 7,5 to 0 in 1 week.
Its now been 2 months since i took my final dose and i'm still suffering badly from withdrawal. My stomach aches and rumbles and feels like needles hitting my chest. Very very anxious and a constant feeling of that there is something very wrong with my mood. This does'nt seem to get better and I'm considering going back on mirt, because it's almost unbearable. I'm thinking i'll never be able to get off this.
Is this normal? It can't be my depression only because there is no way my chest/stomach/mood would be like this otherwise.

Still feel down but able to cope. However I keep getting extreme lows( mainly in afternoon) where I cry uncontrolably and feel sh*tty and just makes me feel like I can't cope anymore and have thoughts that I want to die. Been to see a different doc today and he said my usual doc been too causious giving me just 15 after coming off 40mg citaloprqm and to go up to 30mg mirtaz. I am scaredt oo tho. I am so so angry at the moment since taking these. I am a screaming lunatic. I hate that I keep loosing it around the kids (about sandwiches or hubby or anything) and they keep worrying that I am going to cry or loose my temper. They are only 6, 8 and 11.. I'm such a bad mum. Hate what I am puttung them through and just makes me feel I shouldn't be here more. I did tell the doc they seem to be making me angry and that I'm loosing it and upsetting kids but he didn't say anything, he was running behind so don't know if he just wanted me gone.

In tried anti depressants a couple of times but would just quit after the first day because i did not want to feel drowsy and thought it would always be like that. Things got so bad that i was ready to commit suicide. My problems are anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder and panick attacks. I was put on mertazapine on friday and so far have took 4 doses. I am in a 12 step recovery programme for food addiction. I am in a tough spot, last night i relapsed into binge eating behaviours because the mertazapine is making me feel so hungry all the time. Its not just after i take the pill at night but all day aswell . I am on 15mgs. I have sufferd through years of anorexia, bulimia and compulsive overeating. So a medication that messes with anythign to do with food. Is just a no go for me. Its a shame because already the obsessions thats were dominating me have been minimized so much. But if i go into full blown relapse into food addiction, no pill on the planet could make me feel better with that. I have huge physcological problems with distorted body image which braught on my anorexia to start with. Today i am actualy not feeling as hungry as yesterday but it is still there. I would try and hold on to see if it passes but after reading all the posts on the net. I havent found one person say it ever goes away. I have tried venlafaxine for a week before and prozac for a couple of weeks both of then made my anxiety worse and gave me insomnia. So now i am scared of the anti depressants with stimulant like effects. Ironically they same to be the ones that do not cause increased apatite although i had the same hunger on the venlafaxine. Can any one please give me some advice, as i said im in the darkest place ive ever been in my life, is there any other anti depressant anybody could recommend for me ? Please help guys. Kind regards sasha

"Hi guys, hope you all doing well.
Haven't posted in a long time. Had horrendous insomnia withdrawing from mirt for a good 3 months, Drs told me to stop cold turkey as no wd!! Managed to get through that very difficult period & finally started sleeping well for roughly 6wks, now insomnia seems to have returned, if I get 2hrs solid a night then that's a 'good night' but just cannot cope on that, has anyone experienced the same & any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.
Best wishes to all

"Hi Folks,
I hope you are as well as can be. 1 week ago I started on 30mg Mirtazapine to help my depression, having found that 40mg Citalopram, which I took for around 8 weeks, was not really helping lift my low mood. Is anyone else on this dose and what are your feelings on it? How long before you felt it 'kick in'? I should add, I am 37 years old and in good physical health aside.
Part of the reason I asked to try something away from Citalopram was that I was not sleeping well - I have been on 30mg Mirtazapine for 1 week now and already I can recall vivid dreams, so know I am getting some sleep at least!
I am very interested in hearing from others who are or have been on Mirtazapine, particularly if you also started on Citalopram.
Thanks
Jason.

"Hi anyone had these symptoms, I woke up with a sore throat this morning. Been painful all day, taken paracetamols but I am sitting in front of the fire shivering, heads thumping too. I'm not sweating I keep getting that cold feeling through my arms and down my spine. Took my blood pressure which is quite high 167/106 pulse 109. Tried taking my temperature but the battery is low in the thermometer so not accurate. Keep crying too as I feel absolute rubbish. Is this a virus or some other reaction? Currently on 22.5mg of mirt have been for the past 23 days reduced from 30mg. Is this  something to do with that? I've got a slightly inflamed wound on my arm which I'm afraid I did last Thursday. It is quite red round the edges and weeps occasionally could it be a reaction to that or should I just take some diazepam and go to bed. see how things are in the morning? Sorry lots of questions but as you know the mind plays some wonderful games.
Thanks.

"Hi I hope someone can help me!!
I have been taking fluoxetine on and off for roughly 3 years.  I was put on them following the death of my premature baby, I had turned to alcohol as a coping mechanism for 4 years wen I finally admitted defeat and tried antidepressants..
However, My doctor and I came to the conclusion about 4 months ago that the fluoxetine was not working, we noticed the pattern that a week before my period I was still becoming sucidal, anxious, withdrawn and emotionally unstable (longer periods without alcohol have enabled me recognise my symptoms better).
We decded I needed to be treated for the anxiety and I was prescibed 150mg of pregabalin at night and betablockers as and when needed for the anxiety..
A month ago my doc recomended that I reduce from 20mg of fluoxetine daily to one every other day, however, I stupidly just stopped them!
Since this I stopped sleeping, became severly anxious and withdrawn, began having panick attacks, been snappy, angry, had headaches, felt like ive had flu, extreme lows etc.
Bcus of this I stopped the pregabalin aswell as I thought these symptoms were bcus of them, as it was the only thing id been taking and it had been 4 weeks since stopping the fluoxetine so I thought that the fluoxetine couldnt be causing any problems, as it would be out of my system and the symtoms did not start immediatly after stopping the fluoxetine.
So, last Sunday I was extremely suicdal, depressed etc, a friend took me to the doc on Monday who prescibed me mirtazapine 15mg for the first 5 nights (to help me sleep) then 30mg a night thereafter.
last night after my second dose I slept for 16 hours!! I awoke today feeling shaky, tired, clumpsy, weak, blurred vision, spaced out etc so I called my doc who has advised me to stop the mirtazapine as I was having a bad reaction and restart the fluoxetine as I may be having withdrawals!!
I feel like im back to square one (back on the fluoxetine) which doesnt even work!! I dont know who I am anymore, whether im withdrawing, actually anxious or goodness knows what.  I dont want to be on any meds anymore bcus I dont like the side affects but I also cant continue like this....
Has anyone experienced these withdrawals or side affects to any of theses meds?? OR can anyone help at all???
I know I was stupid to stop the meds but I thought as they were not helping it was best, but now Im just confused and lost as to what to do next.. sorry for waffling im just trying to paint the whole picture

"I am a 51-year-old woman and have suffered with anxiety, depression and insomnia for much of my life. I have been on 15 mgs of Mirtazapine and 20 mgs of Citalopram for a couple of years - can't remember exactly how long. Had Mirtazapine upped to 30 mgs nine days ago as I was getting depressed and anxious again. Since then have got no more than three hours of sleep a night; anxiety and depression very bad; emotions all over the place; can't go to work. Have another doc appt tomorrow. I'm wondering whether to give the 30 mgs more time, or to drop back down to 15 mgs - don't feel I can go on like this. Any feedback from anyone would be great. Thanks a lot.

Now my mood seems a lot more stable then a few years ago, so I decided to cut down because I was getting anxious, the anxiety has subsided but it still comes back from time to time.
My head feels more clear but I get angry very easy I'm not sure if I should try to lower my dose any further because my mood is still a bit up and down a bit like before I was first put on mirtazapine.
To be honist I'm scared of coming off mirtazapine because I don't want to go back to that dark place and the terrible insomnia I had for years.

"Lately, after being on mirt for four years, I have been having periods of insomnia. Basically, I get a kind of trembling in my chest and very frequent urination shortly after going to bed. I thought it was my heart racing but it isn't; it's a kind of vibration in my chest. I need to get up to urinate every few minutes. It isn't just the feeling that I need to pee; I actually do a reasonable amount.
I have been really happy on mirtazapine for most of the time, except that I need to really work hard not to put on weight, but now that it doesn't seem to be giving me the rest I need, I think I may need to get off it. However, one of my main symptoms before going on it was insomnia. I had to take temazepam most nights. Mirtazapine meant that I could cut temazepam down to around once a fortnight, but now it is several times a week. But I'm scared of the insomnia if I try to come off mirtazapine, and also of the other side effects. Can anyone recommend me a different AD that helps with sleep? I cannot take SSRIs. Thanks.

"Hi. 
I had (what I assume was) a tummy bug a few weeks ago. Not a particularly dreadful one, but my few hours of diarrhoea coincided exactly with the few hours our toilet was out of action due to building work on our house! So I spent a horrendous time dashing in the car to the nearest shop with a toilet, and then knocking on my next door neighbours door as well... Anyway, a couple of days later I started to be anxious that I might have something seriously wrong. The following day anxiety and agitation hit me like a brick wall. Since then, I've had six weeks where most (but not all) days have followed a similar pattern - urgent visits to the loo all morning, accompanied by varying degrees of anxiety. During the day I cannot face much food, but the anxiety and tummy seem to settle during the afternoon, so that most evenings I feel pretty normal. Only for the same cycle to start up again the next day. I should say that I am on antidepressants (Venlafaxine) and since March have also been on Mirtazapine, which I feel have done me more harm than good.  So I have just last week started (with GPs blessing) to wean of the Mirtazapine. Obviously I realise this could also be having an effect on my anxiety. I'm just so fed up of the vicious cycle I'm in, and cannot seem to break it.

"Day started off well, decided to go out for a walk. Ended up with chest pains yet again from acid reflux. On my drive home wanted to just turn the wheel into on coming lorries. Didn't but the urge was soooo strong. ended up at home crying, sobbing, turning over furniture, screaming shouting, in the end cutting my arm with broken glass, not too bad to help me calm down. Ended going out again for another drive loud music and fast, sensible overtaking( well i think it was no one flashed me) on the straight bits, getting a kick out of it. Since having my dinner beans on toast decided to say f you and finished a half bottle of wine and now on the pimms and lime and lemonade, What the hell. Is this anything to do with reducing the mirt to 37.5mg from 45mg since last Friday or is just me kicking back to my life or lack of my life. Yesterday I was quite happy and ready to die......cheers

"I'm nearly two weeks into my WD from Mirt 30mg and wondering if anybody else experienced severe muscle aches all over, specially in the neck, arms, hips and thighs. I've got insomnia which is making sleep difficult but my body hurts when I lay down and when I do finally get to sleep I wake up through the night in pain needing to find a new position to get comfortable. I thought maybe my mattress was the issue but I flipped it and I'm still in hell . I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia a few years ago but I haven't had chronic pain in over 2 years and until now didn't believe it was a correct diagnosis but I'm now wondering whether this pain is a side effect of the WD or whether the Mirt was masking the pain all along? Has anybody else experienced this? I've also got abdominal pain and acid reflux which I'm now on nexium to help with but this pain is different again.

"Hi, so I've been on 30mg mirtazapine for about 3 weeks now, 15g for about 3 weeks before that.  Previously I was on fluoxitine for about 2 months but my mood got really bad.  Sertraline for a few months before that, had to switch as I wasn't sleeping and my muscle clenching was intolerable.  My mood is terrible.  I feel worse every day, I think about suicide constantly and I've tried to hurt myself.  My question is, has anyone been on mirtazapine for this long with no improvement?  Obviously as I've switched meds a few times already I want to give this the best possible chance before starting again.  I don't think I can face more withdrawals and more dodgy first week bad come-ups.  Another thing is I still seem to be withdrawing from the SSRIs?  I've had the ""brain zaps"" for about 2 months, they aren't lessening at all and make me pretty much constantly dizzy.  I don't want to bring this up to my GP unless it's really unusual and I don't know if I should be worried.  Any opinions/experiences welcome, I'm seriously struggling. I also see a counsellor once a week, about 2 months into my second round of sessions in the last 2 years.

"Hello,
It's my first time on here and I'm seeking advice.
I'm 60 and have a few health problems, mainly M.S. and FBSS (failed back surgery syndrome) and I manage pretty well with the pain involved with these.
I also have a pysch hsitory. Anxiety and agoraphobia cost me 26 years of normal life. However, after a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and a long course of a new talking therapy, these things are much, much better.
The problem is that I'm going through what feels like the world's longest divorce. Reactive depression has been a consequence to be expected. After struggling with Prozac, I was given Mirtazapine and have been taking 15mg/day for about eight months. 
The snag is that I'm sleeping too much. I habitually settle down to sleep at about 3am. I set my alarm for 10.30am. Come the morning, I hear the alarm, and will rise if something must be done. But most days, I'll let the alarm (music on my phone) keep rolling on. I then tend to surface at about noon, or later.
Being self-employed, I don't need to follow a normal pattern of work. A rude awakening, such as a phone call or postal delivery, can have me feeling dozy all day long.
I've read about Mirtazapine's being used for insomnia and the situation begs a question. I've never felt good in the morning anyway but...
* Is the Mirtazapine dose enough to make me somnolent like this?
or
* Am I avoiding facing the day because of the depression, and I need to take more Mirtazapine?
I have no strong feelings about Mirtazapine. I don't feel dependent on it and it seems to make me generally more cheerful.
So, I'm considering dropping the dose to 7.5mg/day. I usually take it at midnight. I usually drop off to sleep fairly easily and, apart from some spectacular dreams, I sleep well enough. 
There's no hurry on this - I've to have an operation soon (trapreziectomy) and a significant change before this probably isn't a good idea. But constructive thoughts, and/or experiences, would be welcome.
Thank you.

"Hi,
I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression symptoms last winter connected with a bout of insomnia.
I was initailly put on Citalopram but this made me feel much worse and exacerbarted my symptoms.
After several months my GP suggested I come off Cit and try Mirtazipine and I am pleased to report that I significantly improved in a short space of time and felt like my old self. I was prescribed a 15mg dosage.
Now after 8 months or so I have detected signs of the anxiety returning whilst on Mirt and have had disturbed sleep recently. 
I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or can advise.  I intend going back to my GP but I dont want to increase the dose as ideally I would like to start thinking about coming off it.

"Hi,
I am on 30mg mirtazapine and drank a lot on Friday so didn't take my pill. Then on Saturday evening I was still hungover so didn't take my pill and last night I was really tired so was not sure if I had taken it but I slept terribly so assume I did not - just didn't want to double dose.
I have been having anxiety attacks about taking the pill and can't breathe properly and feel sick and am really worried about whether it is okay to take the pill again after missing it for 3 days - I usually miss it once or twice a week due to drinking.
I am aware it's not encouraged to miss the pill because it messes with my hormones, but is it dangerous to take it again eg. will it give me a heart attack etc.
Please reply ASAP

            I am currently withdrawing from Mirtazapine and have to say its not been easy. I have managed to get down to 15mg for the last 2 weeks but everyday I feel lousy. I wouldnt say a depressed lousy just rough, like the days are an effort. My doctor has offered me something called the Prozac bridge, and I am asking if anyone has used this successfully. From what i'm told you start taking the Prozac as you decrease the mirt dose, and hopefully as the mirt leaves your system the prozac cushions the withdrawal, then you kep taking the prozac, wait to stabilise and then wean off the Prozac, which apparently is a darn site easier than getting off the Mirt. Any success stories would be greatly appreciated

I am aware you cannot get something that strong over the counter, but anything that helps even a little I will be grateful to hear from you ?
I have tried to lose wieght on this drug, tried a different dosage with no luck. This weight gain has pushed me into a deeper depression than I've been in for years.
SO long as I can sleep, I can quit easily.
So any luck with sleep aids for mirtazapine quitting induced insomnia ???
Failing that I will ask my doctor for a strong sleep aid (not sure they'd give me one though..)

"over the last 8 weeks I have been weened off Fluoxatine (Prozac) @ 60mg after crashing into my own personal hell after 12months of bliss.
I am now on Mirt @ 15mg, over the last 3 weeks on Mirt I have started sleeping more (still wake up at least twice in the night but thats better than getting 10- 30 minutes a night) but my dreams are insane... theyre like watching badly written and directed films.
I wake up everyday feeling like I'm hungover and have no energy at all, before I started the Mirt I had lost weight and had just bought new clothes to match my new weight, I have now put it back on which isnt helped by the lack of energy.
My re-increased weight isnt helping my lower back pain which I have always managed with paracetamol (now has no effect)
and on saturday for the first time in my life I had a panic attack in the middle of Asda while shopping with my mum
I'm just not convinced that all this negative outweighs the joy of a proper nights sleep.... obviously I will be discussing with my GP on Monday when i go, but advice would be apprechiated

" Wanted to start this discussion by thanking all of you for this information. I'm just starting to come off of mirt and what a nightmare. I was on 15 mg in January 2015 and reduced my dosage to 7.5 over the past 8 months. I thought i was in the clear until last week. I cut my 7.5 dose in half last monday and now its 6 days later and i feel horrible. I tried to take 3.75 mg each night and im having bad withdrawals.. I am a former addict and never went through something like this. I was on Oxycontin for a while and coming off that was a walk in the park compared to this.. I have been currently taking 7.5 mg for the past 8 months but cant come off of this crap. I hate this drug. It haS TAKEN years of my life away. Sorry I'm all over but forgot to mention i have been on Mirt since 2008..i'm shaking right now and its the craziest feeling i have ever had..waking up with tremors, shaking etc... If anyone can relate.. Just wanted to start this discussion to get some info on this evil drug!! Hope everyone is doing ok if their going through the same thing..

"Hi
I've been on 15mg mirtazapine for about 6 months now - it was to help with my sleep problems.  It's helped but I feel the side effects outweigh the benefits.  If I want to come off this how should I go about doing it?

"So I've come down from 30mg down to 7.5mg in about 3 weeks hasn't been as hard as last time. Starting to notice it now with nausea and increased aniexty since going down from 15mg to 7.5mg sleep has been bad but got some sleeping tablets off the doctor. While doing this it's kicked off my autoimmune disease into a major flare colistis I've also had 3 infections uti tonsillitis and now sinititus so I don't know if feel unwell anyway has masked my wd. Last night was my last 7.5mg and I'm changing to a different ssri on Thursday which I hope will stop the harsh of the wd. My syptoms so far have been heart beat irregular chest pains slight tremble. Hot flashes lack of sleep. Spikes in aniexty completely random though. Diarrhea and nausea. It's been hard but not unbearable. I'm hoping my change over goes smoothly and I feel better soon. I also pray anyone going through mirtazapine wd heals quickly x

Do not swallow the tablet whole. Allow it to dissolve in your mouth without chewing. If desired, you may drink liquid to help swallow the dissolved tablet.

"I'm a 22 year old female. I've been underweight most of my life, I mention to my doctor 9 months ago asking if there was any type of appetite increasers I could take. For some reason he perscribes me Mirtzapine, even though I'm already on an antianxiety (Paxil) for 4 years. I wasn't even aware until much later that Mirt was an antidepressant.
So it helps me gain weight, and amazingly the only other side effect is about once weekly constipation. I'd gained the weight I wanted and last week I asked to be taken off of it. Last weekend I had went through a three day bout on antibiotics on a UTI, so while feeling awful already I thought it must be a good time to withdraw from Mirt. The doctor gave me permission.
So I had lately been halving my 15 mgs into 7.5s, preparing to quit. I quit cold turkey on Monday. Ever since then, I have been overwhelmingly constipated or having diarrhea, getting chills that raise my temperature up to 99.4, and immense amount of gas.
I have a doctor's appointment in two days but until then I am at a loss for what to do. I feel miserable. I first tried everything, Peptobismal, Gas-X, Antacids, Alkaseltzers, and Miralax once or twice. I found that that was all making things worse, and tried to focus on guzzling water and eating better, with a fiber bar every day despite the fact that my appetitie is zilch now.
Now I don't even know if you could say I'm constipated - I'm having bms every day, but they are painful, small, dark, tarry and often slivers, and still a huge amount of gas. But if I go two days without laxitive, I start to feel clogged up. I posted this elsewhere and a woman suggested the only lax I should be trying is drinking two tablespoons of mineral oil before bed with lots of water. That seemed to help the one time, but I just dont want to get Lazy Bowel Syndrome and overuse laxitives of any kind.
I've been reading this forum and I am at a loss - It's been exactly one week since I quit, how much longer will this take? What can I do?

"i tried mirt back in August slept well but boy did I regret it the next day and the day after and the next, trouble is I wasn't sleeping well. But had some sort of motivation. And never felt depressed, maybe low because of worry and anxiety that I constantly had.
so I don't get the whole lethargy, if something can knock you out like this for longer than all the anaesthetics I can remember how can it be good for you?
 I've been in decline ever since, and 2 days ago, I thought that was it. Can't carry on working and went crazy to a point I couldn't control. But for some reason I managed to calm down by talking to people. Everybody drums in my head I can't help you you need ad. And I am scared of them. I've taken traz for  2 week and didn't get on with em either.
so 2 days ago I ring my psychiatrist in panic and he only rings me back at 8pm. I'm on the phone with him. And tells me you need sleep. I usually sleep 4hrs a day in bits.
he says take mirt now so I do. I'm going through the same symptoms again. The tingly ness in my jaw as if the anaesthetics of a dentist is wearing off. That lasted 2 weeks by the way. And the fatigue for around well. Still have it today.
just wanted to share my experience. I know people will say not everyone gets that bad on them but I did, and I think it's one of those either great drugs or really bad drugs depending on you. But how can anyone carry on thinking this will get better and push yourself to keep taking them. It's absurd to me?
im really upset that I've been as stupid as to take it again.
ruins my life which was already crap.
my moms friend takes it and she's much better. How bizarre. Why can't I find a treatment like that?

"I'll make this short. After 6 months and 2 weeks, I am having what appears to be protracted recurrent withdrawals, which are withdrawals that all of a sudden seem to return after a period of getting better. I am having severe abdominal cramps, general sick feeling, sleeping problems, and I have to force myself to eat. I have gone from 204 to 167, but have been at 167 - 168 for 19 days. I have significant fatigue, no stamina, feelings of doom, wondering if this is ever going to end. Also, thoughts of going back on the drug. This has been horrible. If you are Christian, please add me to your prayers to Jesus. I need His help. I have been to the Emergency Room several times for chest pain, abdominal pain, and stroke symptoms, all of which were negative, including the labs (blood work). Thanks for any prayers sent on my behalf. David

Has anyone else experienced similar effects. I used to take Fluoxitine which worked wonders but he won't allow me to take it anymore as he says it makes me too hyper.

"I was put on Mirtazapine in May 2013. I was afraid to start meds as I had a nasty reaction to an SSRI many years ago. I agreed to try Mirtazapine for my anxiety but only at 7.5mg. I took it for 8 months and then I agreed to increase to 15mg as my anxiety was much worse. I was having intrusive thoughts and afraid to be alone. The 15mg did help but with it I put alot of weight on. The weight was much needed as I was only 84lbs, now I am 116lbs but I did go up to 128lbs last year. I have to workout daily and count my calories and lower my carbs, it's horrible having to do this after always being so thin. Yes I was far too thin but I am not naturally curvy and don't have to watch everything I eat. I now can't indulge without ballooning which is quite depressing.
Mirtazapine has helped somewhat but my intrusive thoughts haven't really left. I'd say I feel calmer and much more relaxed. I don't feel low anymore so my GP tells me I don't need to worry about weaning off yet but I worry daily about how bad withdrawal is and I think I am under pressure to get off is soon because it's been over 2 years now I have been on this drug. My GP says you eat now, you sleep, you are calmer... why rush off? he is right I guess.
So is withdrawal bad? I have read such horror stories I am scared I won't be able to handle it. When my anxiety was at it's worst I was housebound, terrified of being alone incase I lost control and hurt myself or others... My anxiety went off scale. I have calmed that through CBT and the Mirtazapine and cutting out the stress in my life that led me to extreme anxiety. I am afraid of ever going back to such bad anxiety and what if withdrawal does make me that anxious again. I was diagnosed with very high anxiety, general anxiety and OCD type thoughts. It all started after a very stressful time in my life.
Any reassurance? or advice? I am only on 15mg. 
Thank you
Ju

"Well after all finnaly losing it last Saturday on matazapine and having a complete breakdown on 30mg the doctors are starting to think I may by bipolar and mirtazapine is causing me a lot of problems as since I went up to the 30mg. They believe it caused a mixed state mania very scary makes sense since every dose increase has caused mania episodes in my but nice one lol. Tuesday I was told to go cold turkey however me knowing better about the wd he'll this drug causes I didn't listen and went down to 15mg. I was expecting since last time I did very harsh nasty wd symptoms so Tuesday night no mirt other then bad sleep not too bad by Wednesday shaking diarrhea and feeling very sick hot flushes aniexty through the roof so I took a 30mg that night again stopped by next morning Thursday night I only took a 15mg other then slight shaking and mild diarrhea and hot flushes mainly morning one or two no sickness. I plan on doctors advice to only take a 15mg tonight but so far so good. Not nearly as bad as last time were I was so I'll. The wd seems to hit me very fast I must have a quick matalisun and be at the lower end of 20 hours half life then the higher end of 40 hours. Seems much easier this time round thank God. But i have also been put on 80mg sr propranolol and diazepam 5mg at night and I'm meant to take 2 5mg throughout the day but I don't want to be a zombie to sticking with the 2mg tablets I have for now. Was taking 3x daily but only taken one today. I'm on the tail end of a severe spike so having breakthrough adrenaline rushes. Could be wd aswell but it's probably off the episode since I've been having them since before wd. I'll repost and let you know how I get on but maybe the propanlol is helping the wd alot and might be something to consider if suffering yourself oh a 5mg diazepam at night God send for the insomnia x

"Question, i have been on mirt 45mg now for around 3 months, have put on just over a stone in weight which is not good. I now get chest and left arm pains when walking, exercising. Informed GP of this she said that it will be acid relux due to weight gain. Didn't check blood pressure etc or suggest anything. Went to pharmacist and asked what i could take, advised normal indigestion remedy beginning with G incase I can't advertise. The problem I now have after eating I take the recommended 2 5 mg spoons of this then I get the feeling of disassociation, as if I am outside looking in. Happened last night, this morning and now again so I'm not imagining it. Very weird feeling, as if my head doesn't belomg to me. Still got pains in chest on walkng and took 2 chewy tablets and sat down, pains went. Has anyone else had acid reflux and weird feeling taking these remediess. Also I keep getting an upset stomach. any other suggestions very welcome. Going to see physiciatrist next Friday and want to start coming off mirt as I am no better and the weight gain is pants.

"I've been on mirtazapine (remeron) for 3 weeks. I was prescribed it after an intense reaction to a couple SSRIs that left my not sleeping and with frayed nerves. I started the Mirt at 15 mg, but as it was way too sedating, I cut down to 7.5 after the first week. I've decided to come off it as it doesn't seem to be doing much, and I don't like the side effects:
-daytime sedation
-dry eyes
-constant thirst
-GI upset
-headaches
The last two days, I've taken only crumbs of the pill - maybe 4 mg, and my sleep has been rough.
Last night I tried melatonin as well, and was able to fall asleep, but still woke in the middle of the night unable to fall back asleep (without the help of .75 mg of lorazepam).
Any tips for surviving the insomnia? I was a GREAT sleeper before i tried any psych meds, and i'm leary of relying on lorazepam as a bridge to sleep.

"I just wonder how others cope with this.  I have suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember.  Years ago I was prescribed Clomipramine which was absolutely marvellous for me but then the manufacturers had distribution problems and I was no longer able to get it.  So far I have tried Sertraline, Peroxatine and Amitriptyline, none of these seem to help with my anxiety issues.  Unbelievably years ago when you were prescribed antidepressants you were also given diazepam to help cope with the anxiety 'spikes' which always happen at first.  Now you are just left to climb up the wall.  I am still considering Mirtazapine as it is a type I haven't yet tried i.e.a Tetracyclic, has anyone who has taken this drug had any gastrointestinal problems?  Constipation/diarrhoea.  But again I am worried about the anxiety issues which I know will happen at first.

"I went off Effexor last fall after 12 years on it.  I didn't realize that what happened next was fallout from withdrawal up through April.  I was having such terrible emotional trouble, depression and anxiety like I had never experienced in my life, as well as physical symptoms which I chalked up to menopause.  I wanted to be off psych drugs for lots of reasons, but thought I was relapsing and I was desperate, unable to live like that.  Not wanting to die, but not wanting to live, either.  So, a new p-doc started me on Remeron, at 7.5 mg, but he said it was ""gentle"" and I could play with it, increase it as needed.
At first it really helped, and I slept so wonderfully!  But soon, it wasn't and I started adding more, until in short order I was six weeks out and at 37.5 mg and miserable, totally apathetic, depressed, no motivation, on the couch.  Saw him in desperation again and he reinstated the Effexor, dropping the mirtazapine to 30 mg.
I noticed tingling/burning/numbing of my lips and tongue, asked the doc about it and he wasn't concered, but didn't recognize it to be what I know is mirt WD.  After all, he had tapered me by 20%!  Not long after this, I learned about WD and realized all my horrid symptoms since the fall were Effexor WD, and now I was on TWO meds!  Since the mirt didn't help me other than sleep, I decided to get rid of it. I had learned that it is a tough one to get off of and that the best approach is a 10% taper per month.  Not considering the first drop in dose from the doc, I dropped by 10% again just two weeks later, duh!  That's a 30% cut in just a couple of weeks!  I went along at that dose without much trouble other than the burning, and cut 10% again one month later.  Again, not too much difficulty, just some burning and diarrhea periodically.  Another four weeks later, I did another 10% to 22 mg.  Last week, not two weeks later, I am having cortisol surges of anxiety, agoraphobia, depression, no motivation, burning, just feeling uncomfortable in my skin, not a happy camper.  I am now at 57% of the highest dose, and I want off of it bad because it finally did cause me to gain weight even though I wasn't eating much more.
I can handle the physical WD no problem, forgot to mention occasional headaches, but the emotional fall-out is horrid and I am having another day of it today, can't stand it!  I can't believe what being on this drug for such a short time has done to me!
It is hard to accept that this is WD, and that I'm not relapsing, but that's what happens in WD - your mind tricks you and you start to think ""it's me.""   They call it windows and waves of WD, and last week before this wave, I had a window where I felt good and actually started a project I'd had trouble getting going on.  Now I can't fathom going outside to do anything. All I want to do is stay inside on the couch.
Has anyone else had this kind of emotional fallout coming off of mirtazapine?  I foolishly thought that doing a slow, 10% taper per month would be relatively painless but boy was I wrong!

"Hi guys.
Need some advise. I stopped taking mirt about 3.5 months ago a have been through hell, I did previously post a message about it, I've been through ever withdrawal effect imaginable. But almost all have passed, except one, one very scary one that I can't get over it makes me extremely anxious and is now pushing me back into a depression. I feel as if I'm suffering from derealisation, everything seems not quite real, it's causes all kinds of problems in my mind, I kind of feel as if every day the whole day I'm in a dream. Thoughts don't work, I get confused, eye problem and my equilibrium is totally shot, I feel dizzy. But it's all bloody day, every bloody day, and then like last night at 10pm bang... I felt totally normal, like something just clicked into place? It's happened maybe 4 times in the last few months. Like a loose wire just connect and everything was perfect??? Could this be a withdrawal still? 3.5 months seems like a long time to still be getting them but I never had it before? Please please if this resonates with you please let me know because I need to k ow this isn't perminant.
Thanks

"Is there a protocol for titrating off Mirtazapine? I used the Ashton Manual when I was coming off a benzodyazinpine (Clonazapam - 15 years) a few years ago and it was very helpful in making slow, steady cuts.

"Was on 45g for 2 years and 30g prior. Down to 7.5g in 6 weeks.  Doc said stop completely.  Not brave enough!  7.5g first week and alternate or so next.  
Anyway feeling fine, No probs.  Slight irreg sleeping patterns and a bit of a ming-gong, one day, but nothing extoardinare.
One little tip for those that rely on mirt for sleep and want to reduce is:- the eves when you go to bed and are tired..don't take anything, if you wake up give yourself an hour or so- watch telly, radio etc restless legs, pacing etc.  Take one half of normal dose.  Sleep guaranteed..  2 or 3 hrs later ok prob bizarre dreams, but still sleep, good enough for the next day.  Take it from there!
It really does get better,  Heather.

"Hi everyone! I'm taking this tablet for menopausal anxiety and insomnia. I went to a GP who put me on mirtazapine 30 mgs. I've been taking it now for almost 3 weeks. I have managed to reduce Xanax (Alprazolam) and Zopiclone (sleeping tablet) but, nonetheless, I find it has changed my personality.  I feel angry, bitter, anxious, confused, and irritable most of the time.  I was never like this before. I just want my life back!

"I've been on 30g mirtazapine for about 12 weeks. I only ever intended them as a short term fix to enable me to cope with flashback. Overall theyve been quite a rollercoaster. They've taken the edge off but have made me almost useless at work with frequent abnses and leaving early. Its been a no win.
I've taken a drastic decision to pursue a degree and change career (at 40). I needed something that had a long term focus and to get me into a job where im not sat in the office all day. This time last year, i used to cycle 50 mile a day to commute (25 each way), but these tablets just make me too tired, or with the depression just not bothered. I was in a rut. My situation is all positive now, but my life evolves around it.
My question is how quickly should reduce the dose. Should I wait for now and get myself on a better place first. On the one hand I feel like getting off of these things then sooner the better. On the other hand I fear I might crash and burn.
Would love to hear from you and get some advise. Please share if you've had similar experiences.

"Hi everyone really embarrassed to even ask a question this is my very first time asking the public for help, ok so basically I am taking amphetamines every single day for my ADHD I have lost my appetite and also I don't sleep and feel a bit low, so the psychiatrist came up with mirtazapine to combat all those 3 I have been now taking it for almost 2 months and it has worked excellently I have added a lot of weight which is excellent since I am a bodybuilder I need as much weight as possible and that has worked great my mood felt a little bit up and my anxiety has been dramatically reduced I also slept like a king for the first 3-4 weeks the sedating effects where excellent better than any medicine I tried for sleeping, now 2 months in my anxiety has came back with vengeance I don't sleep anymore but the appetite is ok still I find my self waking up at 3-4 am and eating some ridiculous amounts of food, but lately I haven't slept at all I take 15mg prescribed and it feels as it does absolutely nothing no sedation no nothing and I have now started feeling worse then before I just don't want to go out I feel exhausted all the time for no reason even when I sleep at 4 am till 2 pm the next day, I just feel like I want to sleep all the time and comes night nothing, I don't even want to go out anymore and the gym feels exhausting and boring this medicine feels like it has taken the love out of everything, has anyone else experienced that? I don't even feel excited to do something anymore I feel like I'm numb and I don't want to be bothered I keep putting on a fake smile but deep down I feel rotted I don't want to sleep in the night the sedation isn't working I don't go out and when I do I am awfully quiet and not my bubbly happy little self as usually has anyone else experienced this? Does it go away or will I sadly have to put a stop to this medicine? Many thanks George

"Hello.
I suffer from a serious anxiety panic disorder, with agoraphobia, and my doctor has put me on Mirtazapine, for mabey 6 months now, 1st: 15mg then 30 , now 45.
My question is: Does mirtazapine really help anxiety Disorders? because, my doctor says that this is the correct medication to cure my problems.
It doesn't seem to cure my constant butterflys, worry etc.
The only thing that helps seems to be Lorazepam, and as i have also been taking one of these a day for 6 months also, my doctor has said i need to try and not take them anymore, and let the Mirtazapine, fix my issue.
I dont want to say im addicted to lorazepam, but if its the only thing that works, what else can i do?

I previously took lustral 150mg I was crying and thought they didnt help at all so weaned myself off but felt worse post Christmas.

"Hi,
I have not posted for a while but intended to post yesterday to let you know that Sunday would be 4 weeks at 7.5 for me having reduced from 15mg and 30 before that.
I started with mirtazapine end of January.
Any way I was going to say that I was fine and no wd symptoms.
Out of the blue at 7.30pm on Friday July 10 it hit me with a bang!
My BP was very high and heart rate 145!
To cut a long story each day has got worse.
I am in pain all over my body. Can not eat,feeling beyond exhaustion,
Very irratable,teary, insomnia and this very high pulse and BP.
I feel so bad that a few times today I decided I would go back to 15mg which would be a daft thing to do as these weeks will be wasted and I have to come off eventually.
When I tapered to 15mg from 30mg I was fine for 2 weeks and then they kicked in quite badly but I stuck with it and when things improved I tapered to 7.5mg.
My question is, do you think I should stick with this dose and hope things will improve or shall I try missing 1 day a week or taper down to 3.5mg?
My GP says there are no wd effects!   sigh!
I can honestly say that this is one of the worst 'ill feeling'days I have ever experienced and I have had some really bad times over the years.
MY OH has a heart condition and cancer and I hate to see him so worried.
I started on this drug for anxiety and the only benefit was that I sleep better!
 I know that so many on here have far greater suffering and my heart goes out to you.
It has taken me a very long time to type this and I'm sure there will be mistakes.
It is so good to come here where others understand.
Thank you so much and I send love and best wishes to you all.

"i just wanted to post my mirt WD adventure as it may help someone trying to get of mirtazapine. 
I want to add that I tried three times to go off and without this forum I think I would still be on this medication.
the first time I tried I was told to go straight from mirt to Trazadone. I tried this and followed the advice of my doctor. By day seven I was not only not sleeping much but after perhaps an hour I would wake in a panic unlike anything I had ever experienced in my life. I went on mirt for insomnia, yet this was far worse. I would wake in a cold sweat, panic and disoriented to where I was.
i thought perhaps it was the trazadone as the doctor said no WD from mirt. So I dropped the trazadone with his advice. 
The second time I tried (at this point I thought I had developed a new mental illness BTW, I thought maybe I was psychotic and it had nothing to do with mirt) 
i tried again and felt ok but about ten days later had the very same thing happen. Early wake and panic and the rest of my day was anxiety. Then I started having terrible stomach pains, vomiting. It was so difficult to even think. I had no idea mirt could have WD, but certainly it wasn't the trazadone ....
i went back on mirt and my symptoms vanished within a day or two. I slept again and my nausea went away. That's when I knew it was the mirt, no matter what any doctor said and by this time I was on doctor number 2.
i started searching the Internet and found this forum.
i found people who so coincidently had the same symptoms going off mirt as I did, so now I wasn't alone anymore.
the people here were very helpful.
CITA was still funded, so I used their chart to reduce and found doctor number 3.
She was willing to concede that maybe mirt had WD. So that was helpful. But mainly it was the people here who helped me step down very very gradually for the mirt.
i went super slow and at the very end of my taper going every other day and then the next week every third day ect....
i did still have trouble with WD. 
I slept maybe 3 hours the first few weeks and did awake with panic but because I was aware this would happen I was prepared.
i think the key is to prepare for WD. I took a benzo for sleep and it cut the panic some. I tried not to be to troubled about not sleeping.
dont let it get to you! It's hard
Have a plan this is important.
Also try and have a WD buddy. Prepare ahead of time with medication should you have nausea. I used both phenergan and Zofran. 
Mirt has a histamine block. So I also used a histamine block to replicate it during WD I believe it helped me.
stay as positive as possible and plan for your WD to coincide with a good time in your schedule. If it's possible to use vacation time, I would advise a light work load. 
Keep a journal. You'll want to look back at your progress.
it won't last forever and you'll feel so much better once you are off the mirtazapine 
good luck to all.

"Well after the whole mishap of withdrawing back down to 15mg then been in increased back up 30mg. My mood lifted and withdrawal stopped instantly. However I've noticed the feeling tired and drugged up feeling is back. I don't feel normal. Last night that seemed to lift and I was so restless and couldn't sleep and my aniexty was through the roof. Thoughts racing I even had the thought of suicide run through my head which is scary and new/never happened as I'm happy not depressed my main problem is aniexty. But I couldn't shift this feeling of wanting to kill myself last night. I finally got to sleep through the increased aniexty hot flushes and thought and still feel very hightened today on edge. I feel like I'm on a tightrope and the slightest thing will tip me over and I'll lose control/go insane. I can explain it. If sort of mirrors the withdrawal syptoms but worse. I felt great the first couple days of retaking 30mg only really the last 3 days as it hits the week mark I feel like this first tired and out of it now the opposite. It makes me just want to throw all the meds in the bin however I know how bad the withdrawal is. Has anyone else experienced this and how long did it last with increase this never happened last time x

"I started Mirtazopine (Remeron) a couple months ago. I was on Zyperxa before that. I read about weight gain people had on Zyprexa and asked my psychiatrist to look for an alternative. He prescribed me Remeron, and after I asked if there would be any weight gain he said no. I took his word for it, since we have had a really good connection for the past 10 years.
However, I noticed my appetite increased, and kept increasing with each increased dose. I've been trying to lose weight for the past 5/6 months since getting out of treatment. I didn't feel like I needed to look research much of Remeron since my I put my trust in my psychiatrist as I always do. Since feeling like my life was spinning out of control and I wasn't losing weight, I decided to put the matters into my own hands. After seeing a dietician for the past 5/6 monthes, we had tested and ruled out all possibilities for why I wasn't losing weight. We have been working tirelessly trying to figure out the problem.
So as I did research on my own on the medication, I stumbled upon a LOT of frightening news. People gaining 20-90 pounds on Remeron. This scared me to death. Not only that, put I read about TONS of people having increased, uncureable hunger from Remeron. I had to get myself off this stuff!
I hadn't been sleeping that well after the last increase to 45mg at night. What I did notice is that my hunger was out of control and I was eating in the middle of the night and in the morning (which I never did before). I felt like I was gaining weight, and felt out of control from the frequent eating. This was the EXACT OPPOSITE of what I had wanted.
So, my question to you is, did you have crazy hunger while on Remeron, and for those of you who have discounted Remeron, were you able to lose the weight? Also, how long did it take, and when did you hunger begin to decrease after you stopped Remeron?

"Hello,
I've been on 30mg of mirtazapine for just slightly over a year. I recently decided to quit cold turkey.
It's been 2.5 weeks now. For the first couple of weeks, I felt great (emotionally). The only real side effects were insomnia, nausea, vomitting in the mornings and a loss of appetite.
For the past few days, the insomnia is mostly gone. I still have a reduced appetite, nausea and vomit in the mornings. My legs and teeth also hurt. None of these are particularly uncomfortable. But now, in addition to these symptoms, I also feel very anxious and depressed. The anxiety is worse in the mornings - I wake up and I wish I could go back to sleep or just die. But I have to get up and the first thing I do everyday is go and vomit. I also feel anxious about the future and can't help but worry I've made some wrong choices in life.
I also feel tearful and depressed. I cry a few times a day. I feel like I will never be happy. I feel trapped in life and very lonely. I miss certain people that are no longer in my life.
Are these just withdrawal symptoms or is this just how I am (and the reason I went on mirtazapine in the first place)?
If they're withdrawal symptoms, how much longer will they last? I feel I might have made a mistake quitting cold turkey. But at the same time, I no longer want to be taking this drug, particularly given that I've already come this far.
Thanks

"Started my mirtzapine journey 7 weeks ago after a nightmare 10 weeks on citalopram which ended up with me being addmited to my local hospital mental health ward.
Started on 15 mg and that night I actually slept ( had 10 weeks of abt 3 hours a night), I managed about 6 hours and my appetite returned with a vengeance. A week later I was upped to 30mg ( I was also tapered off my citalopram over that week).
I was discharged from hospital after 2 weeks and seemed to be feeling the effects of the mirtazipine I could actually go places without feeling extreme anxiety but I was still feeling depressed a lot of the time but I managed to float along most days.
Then a week past Monday I just seemed to be getting lower and lower each day, my sleep stopped tossing and turning most of the night, struggling to eat again so I took myself off to the doctors on Friday where he decided to increase my dose to 45 mg.
I was also given zoplicone 3.75 mg and told to take it 2 nights on and 2 nights off.
Woke up sat anxious as usual but managed to do what I need to do, same again Sunday and Monday but then noticed I was sliding again yesterday and today has just been awful. I'm back to living on complan the last 2 days and my sleep is terrible I manage to get 6 hours wen I take the zoplicone but without it I just keep waking up constantly during the night, I know I'm dreaming so I must be getting some sleep but I just feel exhausted with no appetite at all ! I thought this med was supposed to aid sleep and stimulate appetite ?
I know it's still early days and Iv had a dose increase I just need reassurance that these things will settle down once my body adjusts to the new dose or is mirtazipne not going to work for me !!!

"Hi ive just been to the docs to say I want to come off mirt.  Have been on 45g for 2 years and 30g prior.  Doc put me straight on 30g for a monthto see how I go.  Do you think that this is too much?  Its only cos the next size down is 30g.  All I got in the way of support was ""see how you go"".  Feeling very pos fit and healthy at the moment.  I had gained 5 stones taking mirt, lost 3  down the gym last 6 months but that belly fat just will not shift even on a strict no/low carb diet for 5 weeks. So know it's def the mirt. Want to come off it asap but scared after reading all the differnt forums.  This drug def worked for me and still helps me sleep within mins but don't really need it now...who knows!
Apart from weight gain dont think I had many other side affects
but after reading about mirt (v recently) I could possibly attribute pretty bad constant back ache muscle ache knee joint probs but you don't know at the time do you, it's a very powrful drug.

"So yesterday I posted about withdrawing from mirtazapine & calmer was lovely to me, gave me some great advice saying that I was withdrawing too quickly & has really helped me.
Anyway I was on 30mg of mirtazapine but have been on 15mg for the past two months which was really easy. Anyway, I decided to withdraw from then and this is how I attempted it:
Thurs - took it
Fri - missed it
Sat -took it
Sun- missed it
Mon took it
Tue- missed it
Wed - took it
Thurs - missed it
Fri took it- then what's when the withdrawal symptoms kicked in- extreme fatigue, extreme nausea and flu like symptoms. So I decided to keep taking it every night since:
Sat - took it
Sun - took it
That's three nights in a row I've took it & I will continue to take it every night now. I only missed 4 tablets so I'm just wondering how long it will take for me to feel well again?
I know it's different for everybody but there must be some people who had bad withdrawal symptoms so went back on their previous dose- how long did it take you to feel better?

I didn't take mertazapine last night and I slept fine. I intend to take half a pill tonight, but I'm anxious about that but know going cold turkey isn't the answer. Will speak to my dr when she comes in a few days about it.
I have also gained 7lbs which is frustrating as I've worked hard to get back to 11 stone (I'm 5'11). Hoping everyone is doing ok x

"Hey there,
My partner has taken 15mg of Mirtazapine last night and has been feeling the common side effects such as drowsiness. This has been joined with him experiencing waves of sadness throughout the day with moments of relief and normality inbetween.
I understand this can be a common side effect of antidepressants, I'd just like for anyone else to shed some insight into this while taking Mirtazapine and any other support anyone can provide.
Thankyou!

"Just want to vent this evening. Didn't sleep that well last night kept waking dreaming. Decided to bite the bullet and go through old photos. I ended up getting very upset crying screaming chucking stuff around the room got in a right state. Went out into town too many people getting in my way. Home awaiting Occupatinal health phone call due to being off work too long, they now want a report from my psychiatrist, Got upset again as had to go over the weekend etc. After phone call ended up turning over furniture crying screaming yet again, ended up in a heap on the floor took diazepam rang the cpn team, eventually calmed down but still feel very tense on edge, keep crying I'm getting worn down with all this. Got a 60 miles drive tomorrow to see my bereavement councillor can't cancell it as she is away on holiday for a fortnight after tomorrow. Meeting with cpn Friday who will be imforming me of a new plan following last weekend. I just seem to be getting worse again instead of improving. I just hate this, I've eaten loads of crap today going to end up being the size of a house. i just want to give up but know I shouldn't. BIG SIGH, feel little bit better. Thanks x

"HI I have been on the above meds now for a few weeks for treatment of post natal depression and anxiety! Initially I was on the Mirtazapine alone which didn't seem to help therefore my psychiatrist added in the Venlafaxine at 75mg and i can honestly say it brought me back to myself and shifted all my anxiety and depression! However last week I had a relapse in symptoms and I have had crippling anxiety which I have had to resort to taking diazapam 5mg when required! Therefore after a discussion with my psychiatrist yesterday he has increased my Venlafaxine dosage to 150mg! I am wondering whether anybody is on this combination and will the increase lift my anxiety as I cannot stop worrying and I think this is the anxiety making me worry so much and I have constant anxiety which is awful and crippling!! I just want to feel how I felt a few weeks back! Advice would be greatly appreciated!!

Thanked my bereavement councillor for all her help, donation to the Hospice she worked for. Had great hugs and kisses with my grandkids yesterday, they're away this weekend. Yesterday felt as if i was on the outside looking in couldn't get hold of cpn at the time. Got drunk last night. Had a walk with a couple of work colleagues today, home, spoke to my sister and mother and now I feel really spaced out as if i'm not in. Does that make sense. I've now had a drink to stop me driving out to the place I had planned, but I feel empty, nothing, vacant, as if I am at peace.......I'm ready....

"My name is David. I went off Mirtazapine (Remeron) February 27, 2015. I had already tried going off 45 mg a year earlier, after being on the drug for 7 years. I don't even remember who originally prescribed it, or why. I was having health problems with my GI system and heart at the time. Over the years I began to feel bad, having the famous morning hangovers, GI problems, and an aggravation of the heart issues. I asked my PCP about getting off the drug, and without any discussion he said sure, and set up a 2 week 30 mg, 2 week 15 mg, stop taper (Feb 2014). About a week after that I was cut down by the withdrawals, about as bad as it gets. Since my main problem was GI symptoms, I contacted my GI doctor, who put me back on 7.5 mg. It helped, but for the following year I felt awful most of the time. It never occured to me that when I went back on the 7.5 mg, I was still 37.5 mg less than what I had been on. I had made a 37.5 mg reduction without even thinking about it. And was suffering from it thinking that it was just side effects. Then, on February 27, 2015, I forgot to take my 7.5, and felt OK the next morning. And I thought that if my PCP thought that it was ok to go from 45 to 0 in a month, then cold turkey off 7.5 should be a breeze.
I have a college education, and have always thought that I could make rational decisions. I am a retired Fire Department Battalion Chief, which I did for 31.5 years. That being said, that cold turkey mirtazapine stop without researching it first was probably the worse decision that I have ever made. For the ones who have followed my posts, you know that it has literally been hell, both on me and my wife and family. I used to think, to give myself a break, that I have seen people on here and other forums, that did long tapers and still had bad withdrawals. I am into month 4, and am still communicating with forum members to keep my head straight and not go back on the Remeron.
My point is simply this, if there is any chance that a tapered withdrawal will help, by all means do it! Don't get in a hurry or be impatient. If you don't, and you do what I did, you may be doing the most unkind, damaging thing that you have ever done to yourself. And, if you don't believe that you would ever think that you can feel bad enough that death would be a blessing, think some more. Not to say that I considered suicide, as I wouldn't put my family through that, I love them too much. I would go back on the medicine first. But if my situation was different, well I hate to even think about it. Do the taper for as long as it takes, if you still have withdrawals, then they will most assuredly be less severe. I have been to the hospital ER 3 times since March, and the expense is unbelievable, even with insurance. Plus, the last doctor that I saw said that he had no clue as to why I was having the pain that I am. I waited until all the tests were done before telling him about the Remeron, as I knew the kind of response that I had got on the previous visits. Why was I at the ER? I just plain couldn't believe that stopping those little pills was causing the physical torment that I have been, and still am going through. Things have gotten a little better, but I am still paying the bill for my cold turkey decision. It is now lunch time, and guess what I am having? A cold turkey sub from Subway!
If you are considering going off mirtazapine, please, even though I don't know you, my love for mankind, as God expects, dictates that I sincerely hope that you will remember this.
Best Regards, David

"hello friends and fellow people's who have taken mirt and gone through WD or can't get off the stuff. You aren't alone and there are so many people going though it and some in the middle of of it and also some at the end. ( of their rope ) I made a facebook page for all the facebooker's a place we could go and post and exchange ideas and yes complain and agonize if need be. It will be a place of support for all. The best part is I made it secret. Which means no one can see it. I think everyone would like that idea of no one but group being able to even know it exsists. So the only way to get a group going I guess is to invite others to join. I am not good with technology so if someone wants to write the mission statement for the group ect...Id be glad to hand leadership to them. The paxil WD site on facebook might be a good source of how to run a withdrawal group. Anyone interested?

"About 2 years ago I had a bad 'flare up ' of my bipolar symptoms which culminated in a crash last year. It started when a next door neighbour started a small fire from the inside of their house which was next door to ours on a terrace. You can imagine being extremely anxious at the time and it did not help my racing thoughts especially as the street was crawling with police and fire engines. It got so bad my paranoia was through the roof. My husband lost his brother and step mum in a fire too so he was angry to say the least. Anyway a few months later I saw the person involveds family who are just awful. They are very mouthy and I think because of all the stress I had a go at them and one of them threatened me although I can't remember this, my friend told me as I was regrettably drunk at the time. Anyway, my head was racing so much and I was so distressed I decided to move. I had lived there for 7 years with no problems and the kids all used to play together. I hit a massive depression last year and I am still struggling to get better. We have now had to temporarily move in with my parents as I was so depressed I could barely function and will find somewhere of our own when I'm better. The thing is, all I can think about is the house I left and if it wasn't for that stupid family I wouldn't have left. I sit and cry about it all the time and feel guilty that I moved my children away from there especially as my daughter said she liked it there the other day and wanted to go back. I feel like I made the decision when I was not mentally stable enough to do so and my nurse and psych have both said don't make massive desicions when you're up or down. Well I did and I feel like I've ruined all our lives. How can I stop this constant thinking. It's awful thinking I'll have to start again after years of feeling settled .

"Hi, guys.
I was taking Mirtazapine 15MG for over a year before my GP tried to switch me up a notch to 30MG but I preferred the 15MG as it relaxed me and helped me sleep. So she decided to stick with the 15MG. I decided after feeling much better that I would go for therapy instead and come off the Mirtazapine, however my GP wanted me to switch to sertraline in the meantime while I wait for an appointment. So I did, but after three days I did not have a good reaction to Sertraline or it was the Mirtazapine withdrawals kicking in. Either way, I ended up in ER convinced I was dying, but they found nothing wrong with my heart, blood pressure or anything. 
I decided not to touch any medication ever again and for the next 8 days I didn't but it has been absolute HELL. I do not feel myself. I NEVER felt this way before I took Mirtazapine or even when I was on it. I felt this has made me worse. I'm convinced it is going to go on forever. I feel wired, like there is pressure in my brain, I have the shakes sometimes and vomiting. 
I decided to talk to my GP and she said since Mirtazapine was working for you before let's start up that treatment again and I asked ""will this feeling go away?"" and she replied ""yes"". I took one last night and slept really well after I was up all night shaking and couldn't sit still. This morning I was sick but my GP said it's from my other tablets (for a urine infection) and it could be a combination of withdrawals, anxiety and those meds. I'm really getting inpatient and I feel like I'm not going to wake up or I will never feel myself again. This medicine has really fcked with  my head and I no longer enjoy the things I used to do, I can't even concentrate, I find my mind wandering off to think of everything negative it can find and then I drown in my negative thoughts. I try to fight it and tell myself I'm okay, but I'm not. I'm not okay. I feel like hell. 
My question is, since I stopped Mirtazapine before will it have the same effect as it did now that I'm on it again?

"Today starts 15 weeks since my cold turkey stop. Main symptoms remaining: Abdominal Pain - spasms, cramps, gas. Nausea, Anxiety, Fatigue, Weakness, Headaches, Tremors, Generally Sick. Some of these are a little better at times. The abdominal issues effect my sleep, which increase anxiety, and that makes the abdominal issues worse, a vicious circle.
I was on 45mg for 7 years and 7.5mg for 1 year. I tried twice. I slept well last night, and so far today it hasn't been too bad. June 27 will be 4 months, and I will start posting by the month until I am past this. This has been a horrible experience. When you are in pain, time seems to stop, and time is what it takes. I don't guess that I am very encouraging, as I don't know when it will end for me, but I can tell you that it isn't as bad as it has been. One of the worse things is that after a while, you will have a day that is a little better, only to have the next day right back to horrible. That has been really rough for me. Good luck to you all, be kind to yourself, and just do the best you can. Don't look at the benchmarks of others and expect the same for you, as everyone progresses at their own rate, and with their own symptoms, and their body's response to those symptoms. Regards, David

"I was discharged home fron the hospital last Thursday, looked forward to coming home feeling reasonable. Things have gone down hill rapidly. Monday went for a long drive down single track roads with big drops off the side. Saw CPN on Tuesday, I was very agitated, phoned a friend while there with her to arrange a meet up so i had something to do went for a very nice 6 mile walk. Home, exercise class still felt agitated. Wednesday ended up phoning the hospital in the evening took diazepam went out for a drive to the beach sat on rocks with the waves getting closer. Came home, took mirt ended up in bed by 1.00. Good sleep but weird dreams. Woke this morning very agitated, phoned CPN left message for her to ring me, self harmed, punching walls, screaming, crying. Emergency appointment has been arranged with psychiatrist tomorrow to reconsider medication yet again after the occupational health appointment I have due to not returning to work. I am at my wits end. Going to get dressed and go out until my exercise class tonight. Oh yes my discharge letter from the hospital states adjustment disorder, emotional unstable personality traits, hope that makes sense to someone.
Hope everyone is doing better than me, thanks to you all for your support while I was in hospital, good luck to one and all.

"Hi everyone best to come back here and give updates so here is mine and any comments and advice will be gratefully received. 12 weeks of Mirt which went up to 45mg for a few weeks and really did not help with depression, and left a terrible morning every day. Reduced to 30mg for a week, 22.5 mg for a week, 15mg for a week, and now 7.5 mg for 10 days. Started Lofepramine 7 days ago 70mg. I struggled a week ago, now for the last 4 days mornings are still a challenge but I am getting up instead of laying in bed in a half awake state. One thing the CMHT person helped with last week was making sure I put the effort in to break the cycle of mornings and getting up as a set time with an alarm, with tasks to perform like making sandwiches for the children etc. In myself I feel things are improving as far as you can say that, its always in a wobbly way but I hope I am getting there.
Seen the GP today and with respect to the cross taper of Mirt to Lofep the guidance I am getting is to now go alternate nights on the 7.5 mg of Mirt and stop in a weeks time and increase Lofep at that time. I would prefer to reduce the Mirt further but they don't issue liquid form and I am already splitting a 15mg pill in half.

However I found that I had very swollen feet, calves and ankles to the point where I thought they were going to burst [sad]
My doctor now changed me to Zoloft 25mg in the morning. I am kind of reluctant to start them as I have heard people say that the cause insomnia which I already have and don't need more help with. As well as it causes weight gain another department I don't need any help in.
Can anyone say if they have been on either of these or both at one point or another and which they found to be better? I know we are all different and all can have different effects, but it would be a great help to hear about other peoples perspective on these two

"Greetings,
I have read a number of experience from this forum both about Fluoxetine when I was taking it at 20mg before I went up to 40mg, and then some of these Mirtazapine experiences before I switched.
Today is the first day on Mirtazapine, I took it last night before sleep at 15mg.
I woke up this morning feeling like I'd been drugged with chloroform!
The feeling lasted throughout the day, I had to drink a hell of a lot of coffee to make it through seminars today, and then fell asleep when I got home.
Does this effect diminish after taking the medication for some time? I can't possibly continue like this, I won't be able to function! After two weeks I am supposed to go up to 30mg.
I realise it makes you sleepy, that's why you take it before bed. But does the extreme drowsiness through the day get any better? Could it also be that fluoxetine is still in my system because I only stopped that yesterday after cutting down from 40mg to only 20mg for a few days first.
I appreciate any advice you can give me.

"Hi all
I am back home on pass for a bit longer this time.
Week went ok, as you know I was getting very fed up and more miserable but a new nurse started on Tuesday and her and me seemed to hit it off. She ended up being  my nurse over a couple of days and between us well more of her prompting as I just wanted out. She calmed me down and we came up with a constructive plan to put to the Dr on Thursday meeting. Which she seemed happy with for me to come home on Thursday and return next Wednesday, again with the option of retuning if I needed to. also my GP & CPN have been informed I am home too. Hoping to arrange a home visit from my CPN also. 
I even was looking forward to coming home, instead of that awful dread, so just maybe I am beginning tio turn that corner or the 45mg of mirt are kicking in or a bit of both.
Plus I have got to make a rescue box for the times that I am in a panic or suicidal to go to. I have started to plan things to place in this box.
Thank you all again for keeping me going it is much appreciated especially as you are all going through your own stressful, painful journies.
i hope all of you that are going through the awful process of coming off this drug are having a better time.

"Hi,
I took mirtazapine 15mg for about 5 weeks, then decided to stop as the tiredness that came with it was unbearable and I couldn't function. I am a teacher and mornings were very difficult, including the drive to school. I decided to stop cold turkey as I thought I had not taken the drugs for too long. I have had some very tough time since. One panic attack, nausea, extreme tiredness, dizziness, vision being weird. I have been given prozac but haven't started it as I prefer to detox first. It has now been 10 days and I am worrying about going back to work feeling like this. I seem to get all sort of side effects and was on Sertraline before Mirtazapine. That didn't work either. Has anyone got a similar experience? I have read some posts but none with same dosage or length of treatment.
Thanks in advance for your replies.

"Arrived back in yesterday, good start weren't expecting me until today. Feel very blank empty wondering if being here is a good idea should I just go back home and get on with life, feel as if I am wasting my time, can't seem to think of anything, be motivated, see what the Dr's suggest. If I do return to reality will all the feelings and thoughts come back? I just don't know what I want. Does any of this make sense?

"Hi I have a 4 week old baby and have been suffering terrible terrible terrible post natal depression and anxiety! I was taking paroxetine 20mg for four weeks but after being assessed by mental health team they have changed my medication to Mirt 15mg with an increase to 30mg in a weeks time! Ive been told that this will medication should benefit me more as it is a total different antidepressant I really hope it does as I just want to feel myself instead of this horrible person who regrets having a baby and wishes Id never got pregnant even though I was looking so forward to being a mum! I am aware the tablet helps you sleep I'm just wondering will I still be able to wake for night feeds? And is this tablet good as I am so desperate to feel normal again instead of this depressed person who can't bond with her son and doesn't want to be here!

"Hi all
Just a quick update I have been given a weekend pass and returned home yesterday, a bit anxious returning home but have coped not too bad. A blip this morning causing suicidal thinking, I was told any thougths to contact them but I rang my sister distracting myself, met up with a pal, saw the grandkids and did my washing so all in all not too bad.
Going back tomorrow so I'm not rushing, another meeting with the psychiatrict team on Monday I suppose to see how I got on over the weekend.
Theres no internet access so I will have to buy some more for my phone as I have another 11 days to go before my next month kicks in.

"Well it is now 2 weeks since I began taking 15mg mirtazapine in place of 30mg which I had taken for a few weeks.
I have been ok until 3 days ago!
Now I can not sleep, pains every where, feel sick, can not eat and losing weight.I feel as if there is a 'lump' in the middle of my chest and this aches too! No energy and beyond exhaustion.
Feeling dizzy and feel as if I am going to faint.
I was given mirtazapine for anxiety and insomnia.
Slept well until WD but anxiety is dreadful, much worse now.
I weigh 8st 2lbs and I wonder if a smaller person can not tolerate mirt although I am sure there are many who are small and do not have a problem.
Think I'm grasping at straws!
If it were not for all the good folk on this site I would be completely at a loss.
When I joined 2 weeks ago and read all your helpful comments and my heart went out to those of you who are suffering so much.
My stuff is small compared to others here.
Any way just wanted to thank you for all the information you share.
It is good to know that 'this too will pass' and knowledge is power!
I always try to convince my self that my roller coaster is going up but as we know this is very difficult at times.
Best wishes to all.

"Hi Guys,
Just after a little reassurance from anyone who has successfully come off mirtazapine. I was on the tablets for about 8 months for anxiety and depression, while I was on them I certainly felt less anxious and I slept so well but I've never been a fan of take tablets, I have to take thyroxine every night for hypo thyroid and that's irritating enough so I decied to come off the the mirt, I was only on 15mg and it took me 6 weeks to tapper down until 6/7 weeks ago I took my last dose, the first few weeks were bloody great. I thought I had totally avoided the withdrawal symptoms. That was up until the night of the floyde mayweather fight, the next morning I woke up after a bit of a late night and bang... I thought a bus had hit me. Crippling fatigue. My thought were all scrambled, I almost couldn't stand I was so dizzy, I was itchy all over my eyes were blurry and I just felt terrible. It's been almost 4 weeks of feeling exactly the same. Feeling sick, being sick. Hot and cold sweats, totally body weakness, even if I go for a short walk I'm totally nakared after, my asthma is bad, I have flu symptoms, intermittent headaches, feeling of swelling in my head, it's crazy. But the worst of all and most worrying it's I keep getting heart flutters that totally knock me for 10. If I'm totally honest I can feel each day that it improves but only very very minimaliy. I'm just wondering how long people have had these symtoms go on for because WOW this is hard. I'm determind to get thought becaus I no longer feel anxious or depressed just incredibly sick. I'd be really grateful to hear any thoughts cheers nick

"This subject may have already been discussed, but if so I missed it. I am into week 12, and my main issue right now is abdominal gas, and constipation causing cramps that are waking me during the night, and if I have them at bedtime, keeps me from going to sleep. The pain changes location as things slowly move along, but is significant. Is there anything that anyone uses as a diet that helps? I tried a fiber supplement, and it blew me up like a balloon, only got worse. I am trying now to address each symptom. I feel that if I can address what is disrupting my sleep, the rest will help the other symptoms. Things in general seem to be improving. Still on the roller coaster, but the ride doesn't seem as rough. I want to thank everyone who has helped me through this so far. I have a friend who is a pharmacist, and since I have been going through this, he has been researching it to see if he could offer some relief. He said that he couldn't believe what he has read from numerous sources. According to an average of a number of sources, the average time from stop to feeling fairly normal, considering length of time on the medicine, taper or cold turkey, is 6 months. If his sources is accurate, then maybe the stress would be a little less because folks that are going through it wouldn't worry so much about not being better sooner, and just concentrate on day to day. You guys helped me to be patient by sharing your experience. Imagine some unfortunate person that doesn't have anything to help them along. I wonder how many suicides are the results of this stuff. During the 7 years that I spent working in the ER we had more than our share of suicides brought in with no explanation as to why, other than,""oh he or she had been depressed"". My prayers go out to everyone going through this.

"Hey All,
          Thought i'd share an update on my withdrawal from Mirtazapine. I have managed to get to 17 days on a dose of 7.5mg and although ive made it here, the last few days have become just too much. I ended up at the doctors today and explained that the withdrawals now are becoming so severe they are affecting my well being. I have been given Fluoxetine to use as the prozac bridge. The doctor did tell me that really i should have had this when i made the drop to 7.5mg. Typical when you see different doctors with different opinions.Anyway its 7.5mg of Mirt tonight and 20mg of Prozac in the morning. I'm just praying that this will do the trick as I am pleased i have got this far but can't go no further without help...Having had such a bad day today i said to the doctor that i'm tempted to up the dose of the mirt temporarily to ease my suffering, but he replied although i cant tell you not too i would advise against it, as he said you will just add fuel to the flames. He explained that the withdrawals are what make people give in to coming off, and many people stay on a drug that is no longer benefitting them as they can't face the withdrawals..Anyway wish me luck please and will post or private message my progress to anyone who feels it might help...

I had vivid dreams, panic attacks, very bad mood swings. And crying buckets. On speaking to my doc she told me to take diazepam 5mg for the really bad days and she upped me to 30mg mirt. I started them on Sunday but I know have sore joints does anyone else have this symptom? I am calmer but I think it's because of the diazepam?? Doc told me to hang on in there as mirt are so good for anxiety and depression. Am not sure what to do feel like am back at square one. Any help would be appreciated

"So I started Mirtazapine about a year ago, at first I experienced the common horrific nightmares, sugar cravings, but I felt I had my life back. No anxiety what so ever, I really enjoyed life. Then, the weight started to pile on, I have put on around 3 stone, and IMPOSSIBLE to loose weight. Even from going to the gym everyday, eating nothing but salad I cant shift anything. So this of course is making me feel horrible in myself. So anyway, the Mirtazapine feels like it has stopped working. I had a big suicide attempt a few months ago that left me hospitalized. I am still having suicidal thoughts every day, my anxiety is back. I cant do anything, I cant work, I cant walk into town, I can barely drive my car as I feel everyone is looking at me. This is absolute hell. My GP has taken me off the mirtazapine today and moved me to Sertraline, so lets hope this works. Will keep posted !

"Tonight ends week 11 from my last 7.5 pill. Although I am still having most of the symptoms, along with an as of yet unidentified transient case of difficulty breathing, they aren't as intense. I am on the rollercoaster, and the valleys are real low, and the highs aren't very high, I am a little better. I still have nausea, fatigue, vertigo, no stamina, stomach cramps, colon spasms, can't get my heart medication regulated. It says on the paperwork that you shouldn't take Remeron if you have heart problems, and the side effects that were causing my heart to beat irregular, rapid, and elevated B/P are the reason that I got off it. Plus the morning hangovers and feeling generally sick. I didn't notice those things at first, I figured that my doc and pharmacist wouldn't let me have meds that were contraindicated. I have really been blind at times. Anyway, a few of the ladies on here gave 12 weeks as their turning points, and I hope that I can join their club. David    PS- I wish the best to all those whoe are on the road to a place where Remeron, Mirtazapine, and Withdrawal are just fantasies that no longer exist. Godspeed!

"Hi all. So, this is my second visit to depression, first time round was maybe teen years ago, diagnosed as clinical depression then and I was very unwell for a long time. I don't remember most of it but I do remember swearing to myself that it would never happen again. But it has.
I started on 20mg Citalopram and some sleeping tablet in February, the sleeping tablet was dropped a few weeks later. I think it was about three weeks ago that I was put on 30mg Citalopram and 15mg Mirt. I an still finding it difficult getting to sleep and I am still drinking way too much alcohol trying to get to sleep. Don't even mention weight. Arrggghhhh.
I have become a recluse. I hate, absolutely hate to leave the house. I hate when the phone rings and I hide when I see the postman.
I think about putting an end to it all frequently but I'm afraid I'd mess it up and end up so severely disabled I'd still be thoroughly depressed and completely incapable of any escape.
I am in a big black all encompassing hole. Since starting with mirt I no longer cry (I was crying all day long before) and I have a curious feeling of calm despite always feeling really anxious and scared at the same time.
I spend my day doing mostly nothing, time just passes, I have the attention span of a goldfish. I set myself tasks to try and get moving, I'm largely unsuccessful in achieving them.
I think that's basically a fair description of how things are for me. Just wanted to record out here for any other lurkers looking to find someone, something to identify with. Depression is such a lonely place to be.

"The last 16 days have been really tough. I'm averaging 3/4 hrs of light sleep each night. Sometimes none at all. I keep as active as I can in the day, in order to feel tired enough to sleep in the evening.
I have tapered slowly from 15 mg since December (using the CITA method) I started the tablets in April last year.
I wasn't depressed before starting this but it has left me feeling so low and desperate for a good nights sleep. I wish I could get back to sleeping 8 hours a night again.
Other withdrawal symptoms include nausea, de personalisation, obsessive thoughts and Repetitive songs.
Any idea when this is likely to improve? It's such a struggle to remain strong when I feel and look like a zombie everyday.

"I've been on Mirtazapine (30mg) for roughly 10-11 months now after suffering with my second bout of severe depression in 2 years and although this drug has helped me overcome my depression, I cannot seem to get rid of the excess weight that I have gained whilst taking it.
I am a very active guy, I play football twice a week and do lots of cardio but it seems whatever I eat, it goes straight to my belly. This has pretty much always been the case with me throughout my life.
I think I was roughly 15.5 stone when I started on Mirtazapine in July 2014 but I now weigh roughly 17.5 stone. I am 6ft7 in height so I guess I needed to put on a few pounds (as I was quite slim previously) but 2 stone is a rather big weight gain.
For an unknown reason I always feel hungriest late at night, does anyone else get this symptom? I take the tablet every night before I go to sleep (around 10:30pm).
How long are you supposed to take this drug for before reducing the dosage? Obviously the last thing I want is to become depressed again so I don't mind taking it but I would be interested to see if my weight decreases if I was to lower the dosage to say 15mg.
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

I have just returned from a 3 hour drive out as I didn;t want to stay in the house. Nice drive hardly any traffic so didn't get road rage, not raining, saw plenty of deer, polecat running across the road and a few owls. Music playing singing along felt quite good in a weird way as now I feel ready but not quite sure what, to accept my depression and the way I feel and embrace it or ready to commit the act and be no more. It is as if I am a different person this evening. I even took my bag that I have packed in case I get carted away, It's difficult to explain it is as if i am getting prepared for something but what something. I am calm almost too laid back as if I am waiting !!! It all feels very unreal as if i am a different person. No I haven't taken any meds only the mirt about 10 mins ago no diazepam today.
Can't explain this one maybe someone can spread some light on it.Thanks hope this makes some sense to someone or have I completely lost it ??

"Hi everyone
Just thought I would start a discussion up for everyone who is currently on or trying to get off this drug.
The process I intend to do is come down from 45mg down to 0mg with a little bit of help from God.
My plan is to come down 5mg very 2 weeks until I get to 10mg then I will be coming down 2mg every 2 weeks until I get to 4mg then lower is by half a mg once a week until down to zero mg.
Well that's the plan, if I can get there.
I spoke to my dr today who has suggested if I would like to come off it very slowly them to do it using the liquid solution rather than the tablets.
I was put on mirtazapine for depression about 15 months ago, I started at 15mg then 30 then 45 over a period of 6 weeks.
I found that when I got to the 45mg my anxiety levels have rocketed and have been a problem ever since the increase about 13 months ago.
For anyone who is thinking about coming off mirt or is currently doing so, please give me your feed back
If anyone would like to follow my progress I am more than happy to post a couple times of week, just please let me know.
Wish me luck guys, think I'm going to need it. Haha

"Hi folks. Update from this entry here:
https://patient.info/forums/discuss/reduction-and-next-steps-403770
GP was keen to move from 30mg of Mirt down to 15mg to get a move on ready to switch to something else. I was very wary even though I have been on this for just 3 months. So I went down to 22.5 last night. I was awake needing the loo about 2 hours after going off. Then woke at 6 am ish and was unable to drift back off without jolting awake and being left with a not very nice residual anxious feeling, if that makes sense. I will persist with the same dose and see if this settles. I am really tired now but even if I sleep at all in the day or have a quick doze again I seem to jolt awake straight away and then feel worse afterwards, again with the residual anxious feeling.
BTW I am also taking Pregabalin 100mg first thing then 50mg last thing. Not a high does so debatable how much they are doing but don't want to change too much at the same time. 
I'll see about getting some exercise and doing some odd jobs to keep occupied.

"Hey guys, as some of you will know I started a discussion on the withdrawal of mirtazapine, as saddened as I was to hear of the suffering some of you were going through I counted myself lucky not to be experiencing the same, however, after being off mirt for just over 3 weeks the only WD symptom I had was major itching, I'm now sad to say that sleepless nights, stomach cramps, diarrhoea has now set in, it's nearly 2am in my country & all I want to do is clean my house so it's fit for my kids when they get up for school, I'm even considering taking a mirt to just get some sleep but I know then that I'll eat & eat & eat & feel worse about myself in the morning, to all of you that are suffering, I wish you well very very soon & my thoughts are with you all xxx

"Guys my doc and therapist have set a date on which I can start to taper down my Remeron dosage from 15mg to NIL. Reason is that Ive been doing consistently well in therapy and in life and am in a good place. 
However after reasing all this about mirtazapine having horroible withdrawals im getting quite scared. Looking for some positive re-enforcement. Mirtazapine was prescribed to me as a AD as I had my first Major Depressive episode last October

"I've suffered with severe general anxiety disorder and depression for about 7 years and have recently come off of Sertraline completely as instructed by my doctor as it seemed by body had got used to them and I was not feeling the benefits of them anymore. The alternative medication I was put on was Mirtazapine 25mg for 2 weeks increasing to 30mg thereafter.
I'm on day 5 of the 30mg dosage but am still experiencing levels of anxiety. I fear I'm going to lose my job as I've not been able to work for the past month and was wondering whether anybody has experienced a quite a big time delay in this AD taking effect? I've seen from a lot of online posts that this medicine has seemed to work for them within 1-2 weeks.

"I've only been on mirtazapine about 14 weeks - 2.5 weeks 15mg, 1.5 weeks 22.5 mg, 7 weeks 30mg, then started reducing over the last 2.5 weeks, currently down to 7.5mg. I decidied to come off it because although I was definitely getting some benefit from being on it, I didn't feel it was enough to compensate for the side effects. I had also read some really scary stories on here about withdrawal which made me want to get off it sooner rather than later. I am going to be moving to a different AD, clomipramine, in a few days. I've been reducing my dose every 4 to 6 days. I'm planning on taking one more 7.5 tonight,  then 3.75 for 4 nights and then stopping. I'm now terrified what  might be letting myself in for in terms of withdrawal. Currently My mood has dropped, which I expected, I'm not sleeping very well, feel a bit jittery and have a nervous tummy but it's all fairly manageable at the moment. Surely I haven't been on it long enough for it to get too bad? By the way my GP said she had never heard of anyone having problems coming off it! Any advice or encouragement would be very welcome! Thanks Guys

"people who are having a hard time going down off the mirt, please think about this advise. I had heard and read to many very bad medical  things that have happened to people who a) have a hard time in decline from mirt b) suffer when going to lower levels of mirt and have symptoms of nausea or any unrelated symptoms of the orignal reason you went on mirt.
if you have any pain or symptoms during the decline off mirt please consider staying on the mirt.
im saying this because to many people are doing a full WD only to be hit with odd physical problems. Auto immune diseases and many aliments that baffle the doctors. Stay put on the lowest dose. Some people do not have any trouble going off mirt. This post is not for you! . We don't know how many people are affected by mirt WD because the pharm company does not take numbers. That's why I wanted a facebook page ( not available for site to friends ) because we could finally put some numbers together as to how many people actually have mirt WD. It's been rough because it's not so easy to find everyone on facebook. Any ideas are welcome. Let's get some numbers together and maybe together we can fight this nasty drug. Although it does well for some and maybe most? For others it's devastating our lives.

"Hi all..
I've been feeling terrible; still do. (Thoughts go out to others that are struggling too).
I hope the following makes sense ...just wanted to share my thoughts
I read an old posting of David's (fellow member many will know), this one: [..""I kept tapering to 7.5, and when I stopped, within three days I was in pure misery. That was 18 days ago, and I am still suffering. Abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, insomnia, anxiety, stress, weak, nausea, dry mouth, and others. This is my second attempt, and I am determined to stay off this horrible mess. I now understand why those who abuse drugs sometimes have to admit themselves to special hospitals to detox. The emotional support alone is worth it. My advice to anyone getting off this stuff, or any of the others, if possible, find you a buddy as support that will be there for you 24/7 until you are over the hump, and do it before you start. I hope that this will help someone""...]
The parts in BOLD really really resonate with me!
Thing is, I've become so so very confused now (nothing seems ceratin except my sufferring/pain). I find myself questioning what of my symptoms are related to Mirtazapine/Remeron withdrawal? and what are related to my historical poor mental health/Depression? and what are related to my Thyroid condition (initially Overactive>>made Underative)? and/or my Digenerative Disc Disease (chronic lower back pain)? and what MIGHT be connected to some other undiagnosed 'new' health issue?
The whole situation is complex and confusing.
It seems to me that whereas say a motor car is taken to the carage and goes through a lenghty diagnostic check ..I (many of us) have but a short chat with our GP/Doctor who then prescribes whatever is the med of the moment before being sent home to analyse myself/ourselves. 
SURELY thorough and correct diagnosis with close monitoring and evaluation by extremely capable and knowlegeable clinical practioners is key? (the type of support that a celebrity drug addict might get after going into rehab or a therapeutic clinic/retreat etc).
The recession, economic cuts here in the UK have resulted in many sufferers of poor menta health just not getting the care/support/resources they are so much in need of.
I feel so alone and in the dark ..and helpless  [sad]
Kind regards, Karl

I am yet to feel any better. The last few nights it hasnt knocked me about as much as it did to start with, yet my anxiety and depression are still bad...infact im not sure whether starting it made everything more pronounced......I just need some reassurance that this is still early days and quite normal what im experiencing. ive been told by a cpn that really it could take up to 6-8 weeks for any noticeable changes from when I started on the therapeutic dose.
Ive tried all the ssri and cannot tolerate them at all so this really does need to work for me however after reading all of the posts on here im getting disheartened

"hey there everyone. Not posted for a bit but hoping for a spot of advice. I have been on Mirt for about 3 months, 15 upped to 30 then upped to 45mg. 45mg was the last try to see if this drug helped. Its not made much of an inroad so now looking at reducing down and perhaps trying something else. Dropped to 30mg last night, will do 30 again tonight, and seeing the community mental health team tomorrow to talk next steps. Would be grateful of any thoughts on speed of reduction from now. I was thinking probably up to a week on the 30mg before dropping to 15mg. then can you do 7.5mg? is that splitting a pill, I am in the UK so not sure if 7.5 mg can be prescribed. They are talking about switching me then to Lofepramine. I am not sure I really want to go down that road. This is going therefore from a NASSA drug to a TCA drug. I hear more positive things about combining a low dose of Mirt with an SSRI. Lots of questions here, just trying to be a bit more informed before my meeting tomorrow.

"Hello all, well for anyone withdrawing from mirtazapine I thought I'd share my journey so far. I have managed to reduce down to 7.5 for 14 days and have to say I still feel rubbish. Each reduction in dose has brought on withdrawals that I've had to deal with but determination has made me through them. Now on 7.5 I still feel rough most days and the thought of going lower is worrying. I'm trying to come off the drug after 4 years as although it did lift my depression I've had endless tummy problems. Doctors have said I can just stop now as it's such a low dose but have tried a couple times and feel terrible and end up taking the 7.5 just to get rid of the withdrawals. Although determined I'm not sure I can make it off as the withdrawals are just too tough. When I have a really bad day it makes me question everything. I haven't ever felt great on 30,15 or 7.5 so there doesn't seem to be a dose I can settle on to regain my composure to go on. Seriously thinking of maybe trying the Prozac bridge to see if it can get me out of this mess. Any advice appreciated

"Hi all, so I switched from citalopram to mirtazapine back in February and started on 15mg.  This did nothing for my depression so it was eventually upped to 30mg.  Finally, it was upped to 45mg at the beginning of April, but I have literally got no benefit out of it; in fact, since it makes me tired all the time, if anything I think I'm more depressed.  I have uni exams next week and really don't want to be this drowsy for them.  Since I've not benefited at all from mirtazapine, do you think it's OK to come off them suddenly?  Or should I go back down to 30 or 15mg for a few days?  I know it's probably unwise to come off them suddenly but since my mood hasn't improved since I've been on them, I'm wondering if I'll experience any difference if I come off them suddenly or slowly.

"Hi all,
Four months ago I started on 15 mirtazapine to help with anxiety.
After four weeks increased to 30.
I have to say that I feel more anxious although I now sleep well not having done so for years.
After reading of the dreadful suffering of others as they try to stop this drug I really feel that I should not be taking it.
So for the past 2 nights I have taken 15 instead of 30 and I hope to remain on this dose for about 4 weeks before going down to 7.5.
Today I am feeling exhausted and although I have lots of things I need to do I can not be bothered to move!
Do you think that this is due to the lower dose and I will improve after a few days or is it because the lower dose is more sedating?
I will be very grateful for your advice please.
Best wishes to all who are struggling at this time.

"Sorry posted this in the wrong section at first, so apologies to anyone reading a duplicate thread.
I have been really happy on this drug for three years now and envisaged staying on it for ever because it suited me so well. I was on 15mg at first which stopped working after a few weeks and then went up to 30mg which I have been on for three years. My depression has been controlled and I was sleeping really well. Before the mirt, I had to take temazepam every night, but for the past three years I have only had to take it once a fortnight or so, but it is very difficult to get doctors to prescribe it now. Anyway, I have suddenly stopped being able to get to sleep. I have frequent need to urinate and my heart is beating too fast when I can't sleep. This used to be only a couple of nights a month, now it is every night virtually. Also, my depression and anxiety have suddenly worstened.
Do you think the mirt has stopped working? I am reluctant to up the dose if it is going to poop out again, as it will make it more difficult to withdraw from it should I need to. Has anyone else been on this drug long term and had similar experience? I have a doctors appointment a week tomorrow, but was wanting to hear others' experiences before I go. Thanks.

"hi I've been described 15mg of mirtazapine for depressio, I've never suffered with depression before and never taken any antidepressant, when I took my first tablet at about 9.30 last night I did not know what to expect and to be honest I dont think I was expecting much, well within about 45 minutes of taking I started to feel a bit strange so took myself of to bed, for the first half an hour I was tossing and turning and felt I had to keep stretching to get comfortable, I then must of dropped off and did not stop dreaming all night, the dream was a good dream about the same thing, at times I felt like I was waking up but thinking back now I don't think I actually was! I woken at 7 by my alarm and the kids getting up for school and felt dazed at first and strange, I struggled to act normal with the kids whilst they were getting ready for school I felt spaced out, I then went back off to sleep for an hour when they went to school, when I woke at 9 I still felt strange and tried to explain to my wife how I was feeling, it's now 11 and I'm starting to come round I don't feel as tired as I normally do and I'm about to go and try and do some jobs I've been putting off in the garden now, this is my first forum I've ever wrote on and ive just tried to put how I'm feeling into words, cheers for reading

"A bit of background information-
I was on 15 mirtazapine for three years and weaned myself off them successfully (very slowly, took me just over a year).
To to stresses in life I had to go back on them. I went back on 15mg but they didn't seem to work, so the gp upped the dose to 30mg.
Well I've been on 30mg for 6 months now and they have really helped my mood (though sonetimes I do feel a little numb)! But they make me extremely tired! I know sedation is one of the effects of this pill, but the exhaustion is killing me, it's really extreme to the point where it's taking over my life. I can't do my job to the best of my ability and I'm quite snappy, also, I sonetimes feel like I'm in a dream, really spaced out.
It's so bad that I actually think I might have chronic fatigue syndrome. BUT, I know that it could just be (and I hope that it is) the tablets making me feel this way. There's only one way to find out and that's lowering the dose.
So if you have gone from 30mg to 15mg I'd like to know how you did it, how easy it was and any side effects you had?
When I came off the tablets last time j didn't drop the dose, I took them alternate nights, then one every three nights so I have no experience of this.
I know that it effects everyone differently but Any information on the best way to do it would be immensely appreciated.
Also, I'm happy to answer any questions about how I successfully came off them in the past.
Thank you x

"After taking mirtazapine for 3.5 years have gained 4stone, no amount of exercise or diet could shift it even following a diet plan, I found the weight gain contributed to my depression thus knocking the tiny bit of confidence I had left, I found after taking mirtazapine every night I'd eat the cupboards inside out & even the kids if they stood still long enough lol, I'm pleased to say that after a lot of persuasion from me to my doc I'm finally off it (although on a higher dose of another AD) I've lost 10lb in 2 weeks & the boost its given my confidence is an understatement, although I'll prob be on AD for a long while to come I finally see light at the end of tunnel, this in itself is a major turnaround to what ive been feeling in a very long time. I wish everyone that's going through the trauma of depression all the very best for the future, it's a horrible illness & very misunderstood, I'd be more than happy to talk to anyone whose going through the same thing xx

"Hey All,
     Thought i'd give an update on my journey so far coming off Mirt. I reduced from 30mg to 15mg for 2 weeks. This was pretty hard going as withdrawals come quickly within 2 days of reducing. Unfortunately there isnt alot you can do but ride them, and keep telling yourself they will pass. I found myself pushing myself to get to the evening to take the 15 my body desperately craved. Eventually I found this subsided and I went onto my next stage of 15/7.5 alternate nights. This too turned into a can of worms, bringing headaches from one day to the next. After a week at this i found myself getting so irritated I decided to just drop to the 7.5 and see how I go. Currently on day 4 of the 7.5. Headaches seemed to have gone away and the anxiety has eased down a bit.So where am I, well hopefully one step closer to being off this med. How do i feel? I'd love to say good, but days are filled with the knowledge I am withdrawing keeping me aware of things that could go wrong...But to sum up, just over 4 weeks ago a Dr had told me to stay on the 30 dose and ride it. I was waking with a hangover, having anxiety to the point of it leading into a panic attack, emotions all over the place. So have to say, i would rather be where I am now on a meger 7.5 than where i was on 30. Hope this is of some help to other suffers. One final thing to add, when i took citalopram years ago it cured my depression completely and never had ongoing issues, with Mirt to be fair it cured my depression but then seemed to turn on me the longer I stayed on it

"Hello. Today starts week 9 (63 days) since stopping cold turkey on Remeron 7.5. I have been posting weekly updates for anyone who is interested. I woke this morning after a decent night's sleep. Went to sleep at midnight, woke at 05:30, took medicine and went back to sleep. Woke again at 07:00, took morning meds, slept another 45 minutes and woke fatigued with considerable nausea. My morning meds are ativan, synthroid, and protonix, all of which I have been on for years. No headache, anxiety, abdominal pains as of 11:00, also nausea resolved after about 2 hours. 11:00 took lunch time meds, ativan, flecainide, and 1,000 iu vitamin D. I still feel generally sick, depressed but not bad, and am having allergy fatigue and seasonal allergy symptoms. I feel better today so far. I have morning prayer time, which has helped me through this. It is 11:47 and I am going to round up something to eat. I have come a long way since starting this. I have spent time in a dark place that I had no idea that I could be. I sincerely thank each and every one of you who have posted comments and replies that have helped me make it this far. One of the other sites states that you should give yourself at least 90 days to evaluate if any remaining symptoms are /aren't wd related, so I am abot 2/3 of the way there. Thanks again from the bottom of my heart, David

Not sure if this will be the right group. Anyway I'm on the 4th day of 15mg Mirt. and been off 20mg cit for 11 days. this morning I woke shaking, feeling sick, upset stomach, headache not feeling hungry. No motivation, got to work been getting what I assume is brain zaps like sharp buzzing pains in my head and feeling dizzy and some times loosing my balance. Is this all related to starting mirt. or stopping cit. How do you cope with these brain zaps as it is happening nearly all the time. 
Plus I am still waking several times during the night.
How long does it take for this stuff to get into your system?

For one year I was on 30mg for anxiety/mild depression. I do think Mirtazapine is a great drug for these conditions. However, weight gain is pretty much a guarantee, and this (for most people) will contribute to more anxiety. I did gain a few kilos - nothing overly noticeable – but I started feeling quite uncomfortable in my body/clothes. And the junk food cravings are the worst! You feel so out of control.
Anyway, my process for coming of 30mg:
Phase 1: A few days alternating between 30mg and 15mg
Phase 2: Two weeks on 15mg
Phase 3: Two weeks on 7.5mg
Phase 4: Nothing
This taper process might be too quick for some, but I was so desperate to get off Mirt that I wanted to speed things up. My doctor initially advised me to take three/four weeks on each phase, but I decided against this and it worked out fine. I felt well enough to come off. I didn’t notice any major withdrawal symptoms, but initially on some days I did feel more anxious. It was nothing I couldn't manage though. Now it has been over two weeks and I feel pretty good!

"I was looking around today, and went on You Tube and searched mirtazapine withdrawal. One of the videos stated that mirtazapine, when taken with benzodiazapines, could result in swollen feet and ankles, being overweight, and shortness of breath / difficulty breathing. I was surprised as I have had periods of breathing issues over the last few years, and the pulmonary doctor said that he couldn't understand why. I am not stating this as fact, just repeating what I heard on You Tube. By the way I have been on 4 mgs of Ativan a day for at least as long as I was on the Remeron. I take them with meals and at bedtime for irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. If I ever get completely clean from this mess, the ativan will be the next project. Take Care All! David

"I took my last tablet 2 days ago and I'm feeling very anxious about everything. My mind wont rest! I'm having obsessive thoughts about being off the medication completely and how it is going to affect me. I managed to sleep for four hours last night but today I feel absolutely exausted, physically and emotionally drained, nauseous, shaky and depressed.
The lovely lady at CITA advised me to keep going as the symptoms are very common and will pass eventually. Unfortunately she was unable to offer any time frame before things improve.
It would be great to get some feedback from other people. I would especially like to hear any success stories - I need to be reminded that there is light at the end of the tunnel. I must add, I have never experienced anything like this before taking mirtazapine. It makes me wonder why on earth I was prescribed this for sleep and assured that they 'were totally non addictive and that I could come off of them at any time'

"Hi, hi,
I am using mirtazapine exactly 3 months and it was prescribed to me as an alternative to Zoloft, which definetely did not help when I was going through the 2 months period of extreme anxiety, panic attacks and acute insomnia. Zoloft helped with anxiety and panic but made my sleep even worse. 
Now it will be the 4th month of Mirtazapine (30mg) - the first month was very bad in respect of side effects - I was extremely angry, I had bad panic attacks, foggy cotton head and weird nerve symptoms. Now all side effects are gone, I am also slowly losing weight, which I gained in the first month, but I start to get back disturbed sleep. At first, it was one bad night per week, now - 2 or more. Mirtazapine's sedative effects stopped working, it seems, and disappears together with the side effects. 
Could you please share your experience with the sleep and life on mirtazapine? How long did it help with your sleep; did it gradually lose its effect on sleep; some other throughs and ideas.. 
Have a good day!

"Hi hoping there might be someone with experience to share. I am currently on 30mg of Mirtazapine, which was upped from 15 to 30 after a couple of weeks and for about 8 weeks now at 30mg. I am also taking 200mg per day of Pregabalin for 3 weeks now. As things were pretty bad when I started at 30mg I was taking 0.5 or 1 mg of Lorazepam per day for a few weeks. Not taken that for 2 weeks now. The depression is not lifting much yet, and anxiety seems a little bit more under control, must be if I am not reaching for the Lorazepam.
So now my GP has consulted with the psychiatric doctor, as the team are not directly seeing me for a few more weeks yet. The advice now is to up the Mirt to 45mg and if we don't see an improvement in a few weeks to switch to Lofepramine. The doctor also said he was comfortable if I wanted to change to Lofepramine now. Or I can keep going as I am for a bit longer.
So decisions, decisions?
Can anyone off advice on:
30-45 mg Mirt, does it help , has it helped anyone where the lower dose has not helped?
Lofepramine experiences?
If switching now the GP said it would be a straight switch, stop Mirt and start Lofepramine, sounds a bit abrupt to me?

"Hello All,
                Well i have been on mirtazapine for 4 years. Initially it did lift me out of the dark hole i was in. I slowly started to get my life back. I am now trying to come off them and having horrendous problems. I am currently taking 22.5 and 30 alternately. I seem to be going around in circles. I do not feel depressed anymore but wake up with anxiety and a general feeling of unwell. If i up or lower my dose it has an immediate effect the next day which makes me think the tablets are no longer working, and what i am actually experiencing is side effects or withdrawal.Talking with my doctor, he believes that if when i increase my dose to 30 i feel really heavy headed the next day shows the tablets arent working correctly. When i reduce to 22.5 i feel better in my head but soon start to expereince what i believe is withdrawal. The reason i believe its withdrawal is because if i take my dose a litltle earlier that evening, the symptons subside.
   The Dr has suggested that i start to lower the dose gradually and he has given me propranolol to take 3 times a day a dose of 10mg to counteract the withdrawal symptom. Can anyone shed their experiences or could give me advice as I feel like i'm stuck with which way to turn.

"I have been battling with Depression and Anxiety for many years and taking a range of Anti Depressants.
Recently having waited years before being referred to a Psychiatrist, I finally see someone. Being keen to have a specific diagnosis, so I know what I'm working with he agrees with my previous Psychologist, but when having waited 6 weeks and having asked repeatedly for a written diagnosis he puts ""F3130 Bipolar Affective Disorder - Current Episode Moderate Depression without Somatic Syndrome"".
I've felt like this particular Psychiatrist throughout a 3 sessions I've seen him is jut trying to get rid of me and see his next patient, he's never particularly engaged and has gone from a diagnosis of depression and anxiety to Bipolar.
Interested to hear if anyone else has been misdiagnosed and how common it is?
I've asked to see a new Psychiatrist, but so far the messages have not been passed on and nobody has called me when they said they would.
The toll it's taking on my health is unbelievable and on hearing that I was apparently Bipolar via a letter, when it was never even mentioned in out sessions, had a very bad affect of my current condition.

"Hello everyone,
I have been on 30 mg of mirt now for nearly 6 weeks. I have osteoarthritis and suffer a lot, especialy my nek and hip. Last year i had some really sad experiences in my life (2 really good friends passed away very suddenly and akso my dog after 15 yrs). I work and live in spain and i am 44 yrs of age.I work in a hotel at reception and onlywork seasonal i.e 6 to 7 months per year. Last august i started feeling very fatigued and had a lot of problems with my neck. I maneged to hang in there till the end of the season but in october i really hit the wall. Major depression and pannick attacks. I first got prescribed citalopram but this did not really help me this time. Previous times I have had minor episodes of depression and citalopram did do the job. This time I really hit the wall . On my birthday last november things got really bad and my girlfriend for 18 yrs and my best mate took me to hospital and from there to a psychiatrist who prescribed me lyrica. 3 x a day x 5 mg. This helped me calm down a lot and i was able to sleep a lot better but was still feeling hortible most days and very tearfull. After also seeing a psychologist weekly i made an appointment with a psychiatrist last march. She stopped the citalopram (10 days weening off) and prescribed me mirt. 15 mg for 4 days than 30 at night time.mentally i feel a lot better most of the time but physicaly i feel drained most days and also have a lot of problems with my neck wich doesnt help I suppose. I do go for long walks and do regular strech exercises. They dont seem to do anything . I feel overly fatigued and extreme stiffness in my neck shoulders arms and legs. Very achy as well. I wondered if this fatigue feeling every day wears off at all? I also started getting teary again more often. I have to start work again in 2 weeks and feel i am not ready for it at all even though deep inside i really want to. i have spoken to work and they seem to think it would do me good. The psychologist thinks so as well but does realize that i have to take it very slowly. I do get anxious again now thinking about working and than not feeling up to it. I felt horrible the last two months last season and fell into a very dark place. i dont ever want to get there again !! My girlfriend has been an absolute star eventhough these last 5 months have been very hard. We normaly do a lot of things in winter but this has been impossible this time. My question is to all of you out there if you have these symptoms on mirt (extreme fatigue and tearfull moments reoccuring ) I do see a lot of improvement compared to 5/6 months ago. I could not even leave the house and my sleeping pattern was all over the place. At least that s got better. Hope to hear from you soon. Love to all of you!!!

"Hello All,
               I have been taking antidepresants for 15 years, first 11 years on citalopram which worked great and kept me well for 11 years. Then 4 years ago i fell over and they stopped working. After trying many others i ended up on Mirtazapine. Initially they lifted my depression and i went up to 30mg. For a long time i kept getting stomach problems and a burning tongue. It was decided between myself and my gp that the mirt was probaly causing this as i had all the tests going to rule out anything else. I decided it was time to come off. I was told to drop the dose to 15 for 2 weeks and then stop. Gees that didnt work, and i was so ill i went back on them. At first i thought it was my illness returning and carried on with the medication. Then 6 months later i had another go and the same thing happened.It has took me the last 2 years to work out whats going on. My depression has long passed an what i expereince is horrendous withdrawal symptoms. I can now literally create symptoms by myself. If i drop the dose to 22.5 then i feel good for a few days then withdrawal hits, up the dose back to 30 and they dissappear. However on 30 i feel heavy headed and increased boughts of anxiety. Drop the dose and these symptoms go, ok for a few days and then withdrawal symptoms appear. Doctor has told me i need to come off them and totally agrees with what ive told im. However i am still unable to get off them and feel trapped. I was given propranolol 10mg 3 times a day to see if that would help with withdrawal but they dont. To give you an example i can be going through my day, anxiety levels start to rise, take the propranolol and nothing changes, take 7.5 mirt and the anxiety dissappears, although my head becomes heavy. Being a professional person and pretty level headed, i am now trying to plan my escape from this nightmare. It would appear that i need to drop the dose at such small increments that my body can get used to it. Cutting my pills to do this will be a challenge and a half.I am sort of relieved that i finally realise what the hells going on. This has taken me over a year to work out with a diary entry every day. The doctor stills tells me they are not addictive, but i have to disagree. Everyone around me who love me have always said don't play with the dose, as they think its all to do with my thought pattern, but as with anyone with depression you have to rely on your own thought pattern. 3 weeks ago i saw a different doctor and he said stay on the 30mg and ride it out. I took his advise and had 3 weeks of waking with a hangover, and heightened anxiety through the day. At the end  of the 3 weeks i thought stuff it i'm not going to take a tablet tonight and see how i feel tomorrow, that day was the best i'd had in months, no anxiety, clear head, feelings of happiness, and appetite, if the tablets were doing what they are supposed to then a single missed dose in months would not have made any different? Anyone who thinks withdrawing from an antidepressant is straight forward,you might want to think again, and of course if anyone has a solution to help me i would be extremely grateful.

"Today makes 7 weeks since the last dose of Mirtazapine. I am still sick. I feel a little better at times, but mostly: abdominal pain & cramps, nausea, anxiety, blood pressure and heart rate problems, headaches, weak, fatigue, vertigo, and generally sick. Some are not as bad as it has been, but I am still sick and miserable. I have been to the ER twice since this started because it has been so bad that I thought I had a serious health problem. It is hard to believe that I am still sick with this after 7 weeks of suffering. I had a complete lab workup, x-rays, and kidney function test. Anyone else suffering this long? Prayers are appreciated. David

"I started on 15mg, after 12 wks it was increased to 30mg, although it has helped, I feel emotionally numb! No feeling, no motivation, etc etc, I've spoken to my gp who says to take 30 then 0 alternating every nite for two weeks, an then stop,!!! I guess I am just asking for advice from anyone who has successfully withdrawn from this med. I have the CITA chart which is long approx 6 months to come off it, I don't care how long it takes, I only have time.. Also, is it better reducing with the dissolvable mirt or tablet? Pharmacy says both shouldn't be split, I am more anxious at the idea of coming off them, I was never anxious before, help and advice greatly appreciated, have a good day.

"hi all i wanted to put my story out thier , ive been on venlafaxine for over
14 yrs , late 2014 i started to attend a weight group due to putting weight on over the years, while i was attending we had to fill out the usual forms and answer questions on how we felt , this went on for a period of ten weeks , afterthis they suggested that i needed counselling again which i have had on 3 seperate occasions over the yrs, the therapist that i spoke to at the weight clinc said i had been on venlafaxine far to long and that it wasnt doing anything for me now, he gave me some suggestions on other meds and natural alternatives.
so i decided to see my gp,
after explaining to my gp about what the therapist said , i must say at this point my gp sent me to this clinic for my weight. anyway my gp said that i shouldnt come off venlafaxine and that i needed counselling , i didnt know what to think so decided to send for counselling and to take me off the venlafaxine,
after a week of reducing my venlafaxine from 150mg a day to 75mg a day , i started to feel shocking the thoughts of i be better off not here went to me feeling very vunrable and the possibility of really acting on this, so went to doctor and i saw a different gp who put me on metazapine 15mg to be taken at night then 37.5 mg of venlafaxine in the morning for a week then the following week to stop the venlafaxine,
i stopped the venlaxine and that same day i had terrible dizzyness waves of nausia,shakes constant ringing in my ears. so the next day i took half of the venlafaxine tablet and i felt better. yesterday sunday i didnt have a tablet and all the symptoms returned , i just put up with it for the day and was hoping that a good nights sleep would help ,but today i feel terrible, the symptoms are still bad and on top of it i feel realy irritated and every little thing just frustrating me, im going to speak to my gp tomorrow and see what she says, i should do.
the metazapine that ive been on along side with the venlafaxine as helped me sleep great for the passed 3 weeks and the thoughts of suicide have dissapated for now. on the other side of metizapine im feeling bloated, stomach ache and diarrhea, out of breath sometimes when walking i cant get my breah, my legs ache, first 2 weeks i was exausted thats eased now,

"Hi
I started taking venlafaxine last August 150mg got me out of a crisis state. I began to feel unwell again in January and desperately did not want to be in crisis again.
many trips to GP seeing diffrent one every time, they just increased tablet and asked me what I wanted them to do ( very unhelpful ). 
I got got referred back to mental health team and have been put on 15mg mirt as well as taking 300mg venlafaxine. Has anyone else had this combination??
i have been off work since February, it's driving me mad not being back to myself. The only improvement is I am not crying every day. I have no motivation, keep pushing myself to exercise, and get beck to normal but it's not working. I feel so pathetic I so want to be me again. Mirt has made me feel very lethargic I am just sat wasting days away. 
If if anyone has any suggestions or can relate to this would be lovely to here from you.

"Hey lovely Mirt friends! As some of you may know, I'm weaning off 30mg Mirtazapine. I've currently almost finished my two week phase on 7.5mg and it's going pretty well. Some days I've been anxious, but overall it hasn't been too bad - in fact most of the time I feel calmer than ever.
This Wednesday I plan to drop to 3.75mg. I'll do that for about two weeks, then I'll just reduce how frequently I take that dosage until I'm eventually off it. I'm kinda scared... do you think it'll be ok? I'm just needing reassurance I guess, lol. I think I'll be fine but you never know. I'm busy with university every day, and I work two days a week, so if it goes badly it's not like I can escape the world until I'm better.

This may sound to some as if I am toying with my medication but can anyone help, I really need the kind of numbness that made me cope better when I was on fluoxetine although I know I cannot go on like that, I just need that crutch over the next 4 weeks...am not looking for emotional help just honest practical help re changing my medication, thanks

"Hello all
It would be interesting (and may prove re-assuring) to know whether people who are currently on Mirtazapine (whether happy with it or not and maybe trying to come of it) ..are taking ANY other drugs.
I ask as I also take:
O - Bupremorphine patches for chronic lower back pain caused by degenerative disc disease;
O - Thyroxine for a underactive thyroid (made so after taking radio iodine for an initiall overactive thyroid;
O - Propanonol for anxiety;
O - Ibrophen as a added general painkiller (see 'Bupremorphine' above)
It's hard for me to know what positive or negative experiences I get are attributable to Mirtazapine or say propanonol (plus, could Mirtazapine be interacting with any of the other drugs I'm taking causing them to be less effective etc). What with all the meds I take I feel like I full of side effects and one big 'lab rat' pumped full of different meds. Only problem is no one is observing and monitoring the results, but rather I'm left to just endure and find my own way.
WHILST WRITING THOUGHT - I realise, and it's become very evident simply by being amongst fellow sufffers of anxiety and/or depression and reading of their experiences (allbeit online and many miles from oneanother) CAN and DOES (such are my own experiences) help in the battle against poor mental health.
That said ..it's a shame and sad reality that as I/we struggle through life that often those nearest and dearest either can't or don't want to be the source of that help ..this leading to more and more isolation and another seperate battle to be understood and gain empathy.
Wouldn't be lovely if there was BIG 'Big Brother' house or a 'Tranquil Therapeutic Island' in which we could go and spend time to heal, during which each of us could be monitored closely and supported and be atleast temporariliy amongst people who truly relate to and care withought ever judging or saying/thinking 'snap out of it' or 'life is what you make it'.
Often we don't all have a great truly caring and supportive GP/family/friends ...and it's us (me, myself, I) as the person suffering and fighting that is left to make do and find solutions at every turn.

"I've been on sertraline (zoloft, Lustral etc.) since early Jan this year. I've found it to be extremely effective at what it's meant to do (subdue anxiety & ease depression) however, I do find it ""speeds up"" my bowel to a degree that it does affect day to day life. (I should add that I had about 20cm of my bowel chopped out to treat cancer, so I'm not as able as I might be to deal with a ""faster"" bowel!!).
I've found prozac ineffective and also a total libido-killer.
Citalopram just turned the anxiety up to 11
I could take the SSRI tour & try the others, but they're all known for affecting the bowel and/or killing the libido. My research has seemed to show that, although it has other side effects, that Mirtazipine might be a possible answer. 
Can anyone advise a) will my UK GP be able to get me this? and most importantly, has anyone been in a similar boat or had experience of the side-effects or effectiveness of Mirtazipine?
Thanks,

"Hey all. I was on 30mg for one year due to anxiety. Last month I started tapering off because I hate how the med makes me feel. I'm currently down to 7.5mg each night and will be doing this for two-three weeks. For me, I've observed that 7.5mg is A LOT more sedative than 30mg! In the past when I took 30mg, it never really used to knock me out. Nothing too dramatic. But WOW - 7.5mg is very sedative! Within no more than 25 minutes of takung it, I fall onto the pillow, tired, and with a total lack of balance/coordination!
Why is this? I thought a smaller dose wouldn't have made me feel tired. What's your experience been like with this? Or, has 30mg been very sedating for you?

"Hey folks, been posting on here latley as i feel stuck in a rutt and the docs don't seem to have much understanding.. Anyway
32 female usually full of energy and happy bubbly lass. Always suffered anxity since young age. Always just put up with it until ocd negative thoughts last year or so. Anyway docs put me on waiting list for cbt and got me to try mirtazapine. Stayed on 15 from starting as anything more I can't seem to function..
So I was feeling groggy every morning like I had flu and waking up feeling hung over. I don't drink or smoke am into sports. Well usually am. Now I struggle to grt out of bed most daYs aS I dread the day a head latley. Anyway I take my mirtazapine at ngt usually calm anyway as it seems I mainly suffer morning anxity and I feel fine in the evening most night and perfect at ngt. I've tried to ween off mirt in Dec took 3 months to get half way and ir floored me. Anxity attacks constant all day every day. Docs advised go back to 15 till my cbt.
So I did 3 weeks ago nearly.. So it has settled a little. But now I cAnT seem to sleep, I'm angry and frustrated late at night. Little teary too. Also often brain zaps Tring to sleep, adrenaline rushes all the time, feel like headed and get the shakes regular, my tummy is all over latly. I wake up awful but need 10 hours sleep it seems. Concentrstion is poor, feel foggy headed and zero motivation. I feel my moods now low and dont want to be around people as am always worrying about anxity. Seem to of developed heath anxity from all the side effects and hassle from these tablets wd. I do feel stronger latly but today I have again constant adrenaline rushes and feel awful. Had anxity attack but tried diaphragmic breathing it helped calm me but still Feel some anxity and racey thought just can't relax
Yesterday I had random muscle spasms and twiches that Scared Me but tried to ignore it. All these issues didn't happen prrior to these tablets apart from usual anxity and ocd thoughts thst cbt was helping with.
I feel these tabelts are not doing much just taking away abit morning anxity and butterflies. I don't like leaving my room or house move days. This just isn't me at all my head goes into over drive it's hard to see it as onky anxity a little emotion.
Im scared to try reduce or stop these mirtazapine with the hassle of the last time. I feel stuck and out of answers. I'm awaiting cbt but also learning stuff my self. I am usually so positive but I feel my life's done for like I really do.
Not wanting to take tabelts but I have no option at the moment.
Anyone any similar experience with mirtazapine?
Thanks all and keep pushing

What should I do with this situation? Should I take it on those mornings of those days off, even though it isn't before bed?

"Hi My names Calissa,
I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism 2 months ago. since then my thyroid levels have stabilised and are just slightly on the low end of normal. The specialist I was seeing put me on a med called mirtazapine to help with my sleep and appetite. He told me to only have 1/8 to 1/4 of a 15 mg tablet, so I started off with 1/8 of a tablet for 3 weeks every night which work good, anyway went upto 1/4 of a tablet for a week or so, was way to tired the next day so came back Dow to 1/8 of a tablet for about a week or 2. I started what I can only describe as inner trembling and rushes of energy in chest arm and neck area, these rushes would happen over and over again from about 3 am till morning. It's a really horrible feeling accompanied with crawling tingling skin which makes me squirm. I was assuming it was the mirtazapine so I stopped it at 1.85 mg. it's now been six days since I stopped and this is still happening. Has anyone else had this as a side effect/withdrawal symptom. I don't think it agreed with me. Other medication I am on are propranolol 10 mg three times a day and 5 mg carbimazole :-)

"I have recently changed to Avanza which is a brand for mirtazapine. It is brilliant. I didn't think there was going to be a drug out there that could help me. Is there a way to avoid weight gain though? Since being on it I'm starving all the time...
SSRIs - the first medication I was put on at the age of 15 was Zoloft. Worst thing to happen to me, made me extremely suicidal (probably should not have been prescribed this medication at 15 though).
The next was Cipramil which helped hugely with depression but my anxiety worsened. Including insomnia, hyper activity, panic attacks, extreme weight loss I was never hungry and the longer I was on it the more anxious and a bit aggressive I would be.
Then a psychiatrist put me on seroquel, an antipsychotic which I never should have been given. The side effects literally nearly killed me! By the time I went back to say I need to go off them I was running into walls, wanting to die, bleeding, hardly able to breathe, couldn't eat without being sick, couldn't see straight I'm nearly crying thinking of the experience.
So it was straight back to Cipramil. Because I had been going so frequently to the doctors to ask for valium to allow me to go to work without suffering from anxiety constantly they wanted to change me to another med again. (Valium by the way works for me the best out of any drug it's a shame it can be addictive and dangerous in the long run, I fully feel like myself on it).
So the doctor prescribe me with Avanza, I've been on it for 1 month now and it works so well, apart from weight gain. Avanza puts me to sleep, helps depression and completely relieves my anxiety I can't believe I'm capable of being calm.
What's your experience with medication switching?

"Hey all,
I'm currently weaning off 30mg of Mirt. My doc knows. He recommended I start this process by alternating between 30mg and 15mg each night for two weeks. Little does he know, I have not done this. I've dropped straight down to 15mg each night. Been doing that for a week now. And guess what? I feel good! I'm sleeping better too, and not as hungry! I've gotta do it for another week.
My question: after completing this two week block on 15mg, do you think I'd be okay coming down to 7.5mg each night (and do that for two weeks)?
My doc would ideally want me to alternate between 15mg/7.5. I don't see the point though! How is alternating going to let your body properly adjust to a new dose? It's like you're telling your body one thing, then the next day, something different.
Your thoughts?

"I have a bit of a long history with Mirtarzapine. I started taking it in Feb 2011 and was given 15mg. I took it for two years and I absoluutely loved it- it made me feel better and I had no problems with it at all. In July 2013 I decided to come off- I took 1 every other night for 2 months (so one packet lasted me 2 months), then 1 every 3 nights for 3 months (so one packet lasted me 3 months) then one every 4 nights for 4 months (so that one packet lasted me 4 months). Then I stopped completely. I had very little withdrawal using this method other than itchy skin & a decrease in appetite! (I did try to come off completely after I finished the packet where I took one every other night but the withdrawal was horrid!)
In the end i had to go back on them because my depression came back with a bang! I was originally put back on 15mg but after still feeling Down for 2 months the Dr upped it to 30mg. I've been on that for 5 months now and although I generally feel better, I feel sooo tired! I'm literally like a zombie everyday, I work full time which is a struggle but I'm even more tired at the weekends and I find it hard to get up and do something. I know that mirtarzapine causes tiredness but I was never really tired on the 15mg and I've read that youre supposed to be less tired on the higher doses so it's not really Malone sense to me.
I'm thinking that maybe because I came off the drug, that my body can't handle taking it again and it's too much for me.
Has anybody else had this problem? Also, has anybody upped the dose from 15mg to 30mg and been tired? Ha anybody else found that no matter how long you have been on mirtarzapine that the tiredness just doesn't go away? Sorry for all of the questions but I'm at the end of my tether! I would like to hear from people who have been on mirtazapine for a while, or people who have successfully come off it then had to go back on it.
For reference- I'm a 23 year old female who is generally active and otherwise healthy.
Also, if anybody would like to ask me any questions about how I came off mirtarzapine then I am more than happy to answer it. Please get back to me, any advice is greatly appreciated!

"I started withdrawing from Mirtazapine back in Jan of this year, from 7.5mg. I got the liquid version and tapered down by 0.5ml (.75mg) initially every week, but had to stop that and start by dropping a day a week as I got withdrawals etc. I have been doing very well and was able to drop back to dropping it over 4-5 weeks. I got down to 0.1.5ml and the withdrawals kicked in, nausea, anxiety, sleep problems, cramps, etc etc. I stayed where I was for a few weeks but as things didn't really improve I continued to drop down to 0.1ml. During this time I have had some ok days and some awful days. Yesterday and today have been awful, dreadful low mood, very tired, anxiety and horrid nausea again.
My question is, initially I was going to go down to 0.5ml then taper off that to nothing, but the thought of another 3 months before being off it completely terrifies me. I am thinking about starting to taper off 1 night a week, over the next 7 weeks at the 0.1ml, but wonder if the withdrawals will be worse than ever!
id appreciate some advice. I have done the taper so ridiculously slowly, that I am now just fed up with the whole thing, and want to get back to normal again.
i was initially put on it as in Feb last year I had the flu, and was left with anxiety, my GP then prescribed Propranolol which gave me insomnia, and so it went on from there! The Mirt only made me sleep in the first week on being on it. I started it in June 2013, so been on it just over a year and have been withdrawing from it since Jan this year.
Any advice appreciated.
thanks

"Well I can't claim that I wasn't forewarned. I'm very slowly reducing the mirtazapine, from 30 to 22.5mg, one day a week, then twice a week and I've reached every 3 days. So far I'd had little adverse effects, apart from not sleeping so well the nights after the reduced dose but even that had resolved. Then last night I woke up in the middle of the night with brain and body zaps. It was disconcerting, to say the least, although not too upsetting and it took me a while to get back to sleep so I'm tired today. So I shall be staying on this level until I'm sure my body has got used to it.it's obviously going to take a LONG TIME! It shows that withdrawal effects don't necessarily appear straight away.

"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety just over 20yrs ago and I've been on and off anti-depressants since. I developed agoraphobia and drank to self medicate which led to me becoming an alcoholic. I stopped drinking 3 yrs ago and went onto fluoxitine. My anxiety/agoraphobia vanished and i felt brilliant - too brilliant! Then i felt bloody awful. I was then diagnosed bipolar so they put me on a mood stabilizer Venlafaxine. All i can say is HORRIBLE!!!!!!! They switched me to Mirtazapine 5 months ago and my weight has ballooned and so has my anxiety. I'm now agoraphobic again and have been waiting 2 months for pregabelen. I live on diazapam and sleep. Has anyone else suffered from a dramatic weight increase on this drug? I know I'm getting no exercise because i rarely go out but I'm interested to hear anyone elses experiences. Thanks. Xx

"I'm new to the forum, so hello! I've been taking one 30mg tablet of Mirtazapine each night for one year (for anxiety). Recently I made the decision to come off it because it's not helping me anymore and I have found other ways to manage my anxiety. Yay! My doc suggested I begin tapering off by alternating between 30mg one night, then 15mg the next night, and do this for two weeks. Then, at the next two week period I'll only take 15mg. This pattern will continue in two week time slots but with gradual lower dosages until I'm off it.
I'm at the beginning of the first stage now. However, I'm tempted to just drop straight down to taking 15mg every night instead of alternating. I don't see how alternating can do any good. It's like telling your body to get used to one thing, then the next day something completely different... right!? Do you think I'd be okay if I just started taking 15mg every night? I'd do this for about three weeks, to give my body more time.
I know I shouldn't go against my doc's advice. I just want to get off this pill. What do you think? Have you gone through a similar experience?

"Hi,
I started taking mirtazapine 4 weeks ago whilst weaning off amitriptyline which I have been on and for 18 years but stopped working for me. Started on 15 mg mirtazapine which really helped with sleep initially and mood. Then the effects wore off and I'm now on 22.5 mg. Although I feel sleepy shortly after taking the tablets when I'm on bed I feel wired and can't get to sleep for ages. Gp wants me to go up to 30mg but scared of feeling even more wired. Has anyone else experienced this? Of course I can't be certain what might be withdrawl from amitriptyline!

"Been put on Mirtazapine 15mg 1 tablet for a week for depression, stress and anxiety. It has been Day 3 so far and then the dosage is to go upto 2 tablets (30mg) next week. Prior to this I was taking 3 tablets of Diazepam 2mg daily for 3 days.
Going to sleep has been relatively easy and my apetite has increased. I feel weak and drowsy all day. My mouth is dry all day and have been noticing a slight headache today. Concentration levels are not the best and in terms of emotions, I think I am a little numb right now, although, anger and frustration do creep in from time to time.

I've read a LOT of people struggle with the anger/irritation that comes with taking mirtazepine BUT I want to know, does it ever go!? Because i'm starting to feel some good effects, sleeping well, starting to be a bit more motivated to do things, but I cannot carry on with this anger... 
Does this go with tolerance?
Is there anything else I can take in combination to stop the anger? 
If not i'm going to have to stop for now as i'm snapping at everything just generally not being very nice..

"I was prescribed Mirtazpain in May 2014, Started on 15mg, to date I'm on 45mg. The problem I'm facing is that I've always been thin, 8-9 Stone. But now I'm weighting 11-12 Stone (88KG) and now I'm classed as overweight. 
The Reason I was prescribed this medication is becuase I lost my mum unexpected to cancer and I was diagnosed with Depreesion and suffering from Complicated Grief. 
Is the Mirtazapine Causing sudden Weight Gain? The last two weeks I changed my diet to purly Fruit and Vegatables and I drink ONLY water. Now and again I have a coffee after waking but I keep this to 1-2 cups. I even bought a Treadmill to increase my excercise to try lossing some weight.
Even with these measures, I'm not lossing weight, but rather keep putting it on, even though i aim to burn more calories then I consume. 
This is making me very depressed with the way I look and I am strongly considering stopping taking this medication, But the right way is to go back to my GP to get an alternative medication without the side effect of weight gain.
As anyone else having or had the same problem? Any advice will be welcomed.

I can't stand it! I usually comfort eat when i'm feeling at my worst but this is insane! the cravings for sugary food becomes too much, snacking all the time and when im at work going out and getting food! I've even started making packed lunch and healthy dinners but its not enough and im just feeling worse! 
I've always been body conscious and hate gaining weight, I do a lot of exercise to keep me in shape as well as the fact it eases my depression, however since i've gained weight on top of my usual exercise routine i've not been bothering as much and my depression has worsened... 
I really do want to give this drug a try but I don't feel I can go on gaining this much weight. 
I'm not seeing my doctor for another 2 weeks as that's the earliest he can see me. Is it safe to just stop now seeing as I havent been on it too long? I've had 15mg before bed once a day.. 
can anyone recommend me other medication that doesn't cause such hunger and weight gain? i've had citalopram but i noticed no difference on that at all... 
Mirtazepine has helped for anxiety certainly and I believe in the long term probably ease a bit of depression but I don't want to be obese at that stage!

"As my title states, I've been on 30mg for quite sometime around 16 months, and I wanted to try going on 15mg so my doctor lowered my dose. He told me I should see an improvement in my sleep, but it won't help with my depression and anxiety as much. Which I was okay with, as I've made some fairly good progress with my depression and anxiety.
But, that leads me to why I'm posting I've only been on it for 5 days so far, but each night I'm barely getting 5 hours of sleep. I wake up, still feeling tired but I just can't fall back asleep, I toss and turn my eyes feel heavy but I just can't fall back asleep.
While on 30mg I was getting 8 to 9 hours. On 15mg I wake up, and I'm sweating randomly, my body feels disproportionate, like I close my eyes and my arms feel gigantic or small it's a hard feeling to describe, and for some reason it causes me anxiety.
I took 30mg of Mirtazapine around 3 and a half hours before bed and it worked wonders in falling asleep. But I find the 15mg acts a lot faster so I'm still trying to find the ideal time to use it. I can't see my doctor for another month as he's really busy so I can't report these changes to him at the moment, so I was hoping to know if it was normal for my sleep to worsen after lowering my dose, or if its maybe because my body isn't used to having such a low dose that it's possible these are some withdrawal symptoms?

Have managed to get down from 45 to 30 in 2 months, the weird thing is that even though i stay on the same amount i get sicker and sicker, i think it has to do with the fact that i have upped and downed it a few times as it has a very strong reaction when the dose changes... so am waiting another 10 days to see a psychiatrist through skype and hopefully she can point me in the right directions...i suffer mainly from anxiety, also OCD and depression and take a few other medications for it, plus i have had serotonin syndrome so need to be careful and have been mucked around by doctors and psychiatrists who dont know what they are doing... any advice welcome, main symptoms are migraines that last for hours, constant shivering, vertigo, dizziness etc.. guess i will be okay once i stabalize on a new anti depressant, didnt want to write too much...anyway, if you have come off or are coming off mirtazapine then anything you can share with me would be invaluable... thanks for reading

"Hi everyone,
It's been a while since I posted on here. Just a general enquiry, can anyone advise as to how long this torture goes on for? It has been almost 18weeks since my last tablet, although I have had 1 or2 reasonable days on the whole I feel absolutely terrible, I have been in touch with cita and they say it is normal, To. Me it seems like an eternity, can anyone share their experiences as to how long it lasts? I know everyone is different but I begin to wonder if this will ever go away, nothing seems to relieve any of the symptoms. The torture begins from the time I wake in the mornings,terrible nausea, bad head, aching muscles, upset stomach just to name a few things, had I been made aware of the consequences I would never had taken this awful drug.
Would appreciate any feedback from your experiences.
I'm afraid my gp is totally useless, refuses to accept that its the Mirtazipan she said I should be free of all symptoms by now, I did mention cita to her and she said she'd never heard of them, more like she doesn't want to know, all they are fit for is dishing out the pills.Anyway thank you for taking the time to read this.

"My god the apetite on mirtazepine is crazy! I just had a lunch break and whilst I was walking around 3 shops trying to look for some frozen chicken so I can prepare my lunches in advance to prevent myself buying snacks, I BOUGHT 5 CHOCOLATE BARS! It's like I turn into a monster and willpower alone can't stop until that sugar is down my throat!
Anyway, it's only day 4 of mirtazepine so i'm hoping this will settle and I can control this. 
But my question is, is it a matter of just overreating that you put on weight or is does it slow down your metabolism?
For me a part of my depression is hating my body and I can get very obsessive over weight as I used to be bigger when I was younger... 
I'm trying to control it by preparing breakfasts and lunches in advance and making sure I go to sleep immediately after I take the medication as for me, this is when my food cravings are at their worst!

"I'm already taking Pristiq however was having episodes of anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia and so my doctor also prescribed me mirtazapine. In some ways it has been a miracle, as somebody suffering from severe social phobia it has helped me to open up a little to the outside world and even attending social outings which is not like me. I feel far less stressed as well. I WISH I could stay on it!
The problem I am having is I've put one a huge amount of weight in the month or so I've been taking it. I've put on at least 7kg but probably more by now, I am visibly much fatter, and being a bit overweight in the first place (and wanting to lose weight) means this far outweighs the benefits. I suddenly have a huge appetite and I cannot control my eating, it is becoming a real problem. I've read people say to get over it and simply control your eating but it isn't that easy, before I even try a strictly healthy diet, I need to get off these pills and give my body a chance to get over these cravings.
My first question is, if I were to stop taking mirtazapine, or even start taking one every 2nd day to eventually taper off, can I expect any awful side effects? I have big exams in a week and I don't want to risk nasty side effects, however I'm really worried I will just keep stacking on the weight even in that short week, I want to get off them ASAP. I haven't been on them all that long so am wondering if I will experience anything bad if I cut back on them. My other antidepressants cause me vertigo if I miss a pill.
Second question, has anyone had any luck with other anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medication that helps with general/social anxiety, that does not cause weight gain? I know everyone reacts to medications differently but I'm just interested to see if there is an alternative to mirtazapine without this one (seemingly very common) side effect.

"Hi i have been on mirtazapine since around december. I started at 15mg and also was taking 20mg daily of fluoxetine. After 2 weeks i went up to 30mg mirt and 10mg daily of oral fluoxetine. After another 2 weeks the mirt was upped to 45mg and i finally stopped fluoxetine at 2.5mg 3 weeks ago.
I manage to fall asleep fine but still wake up few times through the night. I wake up at 7am everyday as im a single mum with a 7 year old daughter. As soon as i wake up i feel this horrible feeling of dread, and like my skins trying to crawl away. I also keep getting a bizzare vertigo like feeling and all of my joints ache to the point where i feel like i cant walk up my stairs. Im only 26 and im not overweight. Ive always been physically healthy. The only positive thing ive had is weight gain. I was underweight up until recently. Since starting the mirtazipine i have put on 2 and a half stone. I think my go and mental health team are getting fed up with me but im limited as to what medication i can take because im on my own with my child. I tried quetiapine once and refused to take it again because i couldnt function atall the next day. I just really need some advice as im running out of options. Im on the medication for emotionally unstable personality disorder and general anxiety disorder which i habe struggled with for 6 years. Any advice or suggestions will be greatfuly recieved. Thank you x

"Hi all,
I'm new here but read most previous posts with interest. I'm really grateful to hear that some of you have found some relief and some answers with Mt. I just want to add something which I think others should be aware of.
I've been battling 3 years with chronic back and leg pain, which despite 5 operations has not been cured. Consequently I'm on a very mixed bag of drugs (opiates, benzodiazapines etc). I've only sufferer from depression forever (about 8 y.o. now am 35) but decided to take the plunge and try medical solutions. I started on Citaloprim, maxed out on those within six months but no real effect except confusion. Next and currently on Venafaxine, but maxed out on these also with very limited success. Also seeing a psyotherapistfor help, this is slow but worth it. Recently I've been hopelessly depressed, so on the recommendation of a psychiatrist, I asked my GP to add Mt to the mix. (I also take propranolol for panic/anxiety disorder).
The outcome was horrible. One of the worst side effects was severe nightmares (much worse than my usual nightmares), which I couldn't wake up from. But the most stressful part is the dizzyness, particularly after a days work. The dizzyness becomes head-shocks (feels like someone is running riot with electrodes and 50,000 Volts accross my brain), and then becomes halucinations. These are not like flying fish etc but are very distressing. Two typical ones include (a) loss/shadowing of periferal vision and (b) unsteadyness walking. The walking one is the chiller, it seems as if my right foot sinks up to the ankle when I walk on it, throwing my balance off completely. There have been times when I wonder how did I even make it home, it can take an hour or more on what is normally a 20 min walk.
I've abandoned the Mt on day 18 and after a few really bad days now am returning to normal (i.e. depressed as hell). I need to see my GP on Thursday and find an alternative booster drug, so if anyone out there has similar experience or better yet another suggestion I'm desperate to hear!
Silent..

"Hi all. I have never been a member in a forum before, so please bear with me as this is all very new to me. I would just like to know if anyone else experiences what I experience, or anything similar.
I have suffered with depression for many many years, I am a 39 year old female. I have always managed to work and maintain some kind of ""normal"" life on and off medication. 4.5 years ago I had an accident on an ice-rink and ruptured my ACL and PCL ligaments (main ligaments that hold knee together). NHS told me the pain I felt was ""in my head, and it is normal for people with depression"". For over a year I was hobbling around in agony, I had to give up my Uni place ( mature student) and could no longer drive. The medical staff made me feel like I was faking it, and it did some damage to my already depressed state of mind. After a year I finally told them if they didn't put a camera in my knee to investigate it thoroughly I would go private and sue them if anything was found ( was a bluff as I was now unemployed on benefits). They investigated my knee and discovered the damge so i had total ligament replacement x2 . Due to the fact it had been left so long, my knee had ""deformed"" as in it won't bend fully and won't straighten fully, I walk with a heavy limp and take painkillers few times a day ( Strong ones). I stayed on disabilty for 3 years, and I became agoraphobic, and literally didn't leave my house. I sank into deep depression and trusted no one. Anyway, 1.5 years ago I started my own company from home ( by pure accident by the way) and it grew so fast, I now have staff and work from a warehouse unit. My problem is I still feel miserable... I know that sounds weird, I should be happy with what I have and what I have achieved, but everyday I still struggle, I cry non stop, and still do not go out very much unless it is to work, and even some days that is hard. People tell me I "" have nothing to be depressed about"" and it has lead me to ""pretend I am ok"".. I feel like I am being ungrateful. For years I had dreamed of owning my own business, and I worked extrtemely hard to get it, but I still feel so empty every day. I have been put back on Mirtazapine 30mg 10 days ago and I actually think my crying is slowing down, I also think my mind is working differently, but I still have an emptyness I can't get rid of. Does anyone else feel this way, no matter what you have in your life, and whom you have around you, do you still feel empty? I would really appreciate any shared experiences from you. Thank you for reading. Kind regards Michelle

"Hi folks, rough ride over recent weeks. Had initially sleeping meds and lorazepam when needed. For last 2 weeks no sleeping med or lorazepam, working 5-6 hours a day but with strong nervous tesnsion, managed to keep up exercise. Normally very fit person. Taken turn for worse over recent days. The sleep is patchy but worst is wakefulness from 4/5 am and the bad anxiety from there, which in last two days was horrendous. Had to take a 0.5mg Lorazepam at 9.30 am today to be sure I could get through a big day out with the family. 
I am prescribed Mirtazapine since Friday and will probably start tonight. Some concerns is how long the drowsiness goes on for. Will I have to stop my bike riding? this helps alleviate things so don't want to stop it ideally. Also i have seen that low blood pressure combined with this drug could be tricky. My blood pressure is naturally low from my exercise, is this a potential issue. Also read that there are people who take Vit D wlong with this which helps offset some negative aspects, any comments?

"Hi,
Was wondering if anyone has had similar experience / could advise...
I tried Citalopram (upped from 20 to 30mg) for 3 months and while I had some good days, I was very up and down and had a few big meltdowns near the end. 
I also wasn't sleeping so my doc changed me to 15mg Mirtazapine.
This happened 4 days ago and for the first few days I was ok and it has helped me sleep. He told me to stop the Cit (all this was done over the phone as no time for appointments) but after internet research I didn't stop the cit and decided to taper off (going from 30 mg straight to 10mg cit in the morning while taling 15mg mirtazapine at night). 
Last night I had the most terrible pains and was rollling around, sweating and vommiting all night (never had anything like it and can only imagine it would be similar to heroin withdrawl) and today I am feeling completley dazed and achey. 
Not sure if I made a mistake and should've come off Cit like he said. Worried might have seratonin syndrome or discontinuation syndrome. The symtoms seem to be similar.
Doc is ok but don't think they listen / care / know what they doing and I also feel embarrassed as I can feel he is exhausted with me and my depression and will be angry that I didn't follow his advise. The bits that I did find on the internet was 50 / 50 on tapering off  / mixing mirt and cit / stopping cit. Anyone had similar experience of taking mirtazapine and citalopram together?
Also sleeping ok but bloody hell so groggy / tired during the day. Does this wear off?
Also been suggested hormonal problems (as well as depression), which sounds probable as my meltdown often (though not always) coincide with the time before my period. Any experience with hormonal imbalances and depression (particularly suicidal behaviors) citalopram / mirtazapine
Sorry lots of information there and questions. Advice on any of these points much appreaciatted

"Has anyone else found mirtazapine really really really sedating? I've been on it for two days now and find that I barely function. I'm drowsy all the time which makes work very fun - not! It's like there's a disconnect from reality.
I actually suggested it to my GP as an alternative to sleeping tablets since she was relunctant to give me sleepers for more than three days - not worth the prescription charge. I thought it would be a good idea to try a sedating anti-depressant since I've had insonmia for years (and she wouldn't kick up a fuss if I took mirtazapine long term for sleep) but I'd much rather have the benzos and be addicted than this crap. I can't stand feeling so sedated and generally more stupid than before. I've gone from 3 hours a night to 12-14.

Its very concerning to me, but I know we all will react differently as we all have our own reasons for taking Mirt* in the first place, well I just wonder when I go up to 30mg , can I stay there?..lol..

"Hello there,
I've just started a months dose of 15 mg of Mirtazapine, and within 30 minutes of taking the dose I became like a crazed hyena. I tried to calm myself down and work on my breathing, this was impossible and went on for a further 3hrs, until the mania knocked me out with exhaustion. Today, I awoke feeling really groggy, lower back cramp. Mouth so dry, my tongue was stuck to the roof. For the rest of the day it's been hard to accomplish anything. I'm worried as I am in my final year of my degree and I don't want to feel like this, as this will be detrimental when studying because of chronic fatigue (this is honestly how I feel). I don't know what to do, the anxiety & depression has me on my knees of late, but at least I could figure out my moods. With these pills I feel terrible. Do these symptoms subside? Anyone who has persisted with mirtazapine (under the same circumstances as me) and found it got better.
I feel hopeless, I just don't want to feel this way anymore.
Thanks for reading xxx

"Hi, I've been taking mitrazpine 15mg for last two weeks and on previous ADs I had insomnia issues. On a positive I can now sleep I or 2 hours after taking and first few days I would sleep most of night but now I find I sleep solid for two hours but then continuously waking up. Thankfully I am off work at mo as I am sleeping on & off till 10am and snoozing during day. I find I gave one good day where I feel motivated to do things then 4 days of feeling crap, not getting out of bed till 3 or later then on sofa. I am extremely ratty too. Will this improve? I feel very drowsy during the day? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks Sandra x

"Hi
i'm sure there are plenty of people worse off but even with 2 cracked ribs these are nothing to the depression.
i'm on 45 mg Mirtszapine, now 100 mg Sertraline, 30 mg a propanol, 4 x 500 mg Cocodomol and 12 mg Diazepam.  Even with all of this I get constant palpitations during the day and can barely function, even to wash my hair.  I just wish I didn't have to wake up in the morning.

"I was previously on citalopram and sertraline and a hoard of sleeping pills to manage acute depression but had horrid side effects, difficulty sleeping and little effect on mood. I was put on Mirtazapine in Late August and have since been thrilled with the results of a higher more stable mood, better concentration, energy and most importantly able to get to and stay asleep! I had however been chuffed that my weight had been stable and healthy at around the 9st mark throughout spring/summer and now is approaching 11st (Jan) and all weight around my middle. Note: I am barely 5ft so this is nearly an 'obese' BMI now. In hindsight I can see I put on a huge amount of weight immediately after starting these but just put it down to being happier. I have noticed an increase in cravings and appetite recently but although maintaining a healthy calorie intake of foods of great nutrition and exercising, I am neither shifting nor toning this weight. Is it really a choice of depression vs low/healthy weight or is there something similar and as effective as Mirtazapine without the weight gain? Or is there something I can take alongside the Mirtazapine to reduce this side effect as this is affecting my self-esteem and fitness now. Thank you.

"Hey again, I posted a few weeks back having been started on MIrtazapine 15mg Oral-Dispersable tablets. It's been pretty good minus one collapse and a few constipation episodes, but that's not important.
I've been upped to 30mg and the type of medication has changed from Oral-Dispersables to Film Coated. I've got a few questions if anyone can help:
- With the rise to 30mg, should side effects kick into gear again? I know some of them are rather paradoxical in nature, but I do want to be prepared for what could potentially happen.
- Weight gain is still a 'concern' for me in the sense that I am not bothered by it, but I want to keep a close eye. Does the dose increase lead to further increases in appetite / weight gain, or is it similar to sleepiness in which it is paradoxical in nature?
- I've struggled taking tablets with swallowing whole and no chewing - does anyone have any tips on taking them whole? Does the film coating also create more problems in health, as I don't want to be throwing up on them (I had the same with 10mg Citalopram which were film coated, and I'm wondering if that is what made me sick in the three days of taking Citalopram.)

I have previously been on fluxetoine, sertraline and venal famine. Finally mirtazapine helped me sleep but excessively and major weight gain. Is there a similar anti depressant close to this tablet without such major weight gain.

"Hey again, I made a thread recently asking for personal experiences, and now that that has happened and I've been prescribed my medications, I thought I would post my experiences here so then anyone who is currently having to research / be considered to be put onto Mirtazapine will be able to get a more informed choice. 
Be aware that any experiences poster here by myself will not be reflective of what you may/may not get in your own circumstances. In all cases you should discuss problems you may have with your GP / psychiatrist, or to your local A&E department in cases of emergency as the main port of call.
With that said, I welcome any further discussion and messages of encouragement to get me through this. <3>

"Hi,
I'm on my 4th day of 15mg of Mertazapine for anxiety and depression, after switching from sertraline due to some of the side effects. 
Since yesterday I've had pretty bad dizziness, whenever i move suddenly. This can be walking and turning a direction, or getting up off the sofa, or even just turning my head sometimes. It leaves me losing my concentration sometimes.
When I'm not moving I feel a kind of pressure in my head, almost like an ongoing headache but without the pain as such. My head just feels full. 
Can anyone give me any indication as to whether or not this will subside? Or any advice?

"Hey, hope you folks are all doing well.
I've recently been diagnosed with a strong form of reaction depression after having multiple pile ups of stuff at my university (ex-partner caused harm to my current one resulting in a cardiac event) and it eventually led to an A&E visit. I've been allowed to see my records to find the Doc has recommended Citalopram or Mirtazapine - Citalopram basically caused a hugely adverse reaction on Day 3 / Night 4 of taking 1 x 10mg, so the next one that is likely to be on the list will be Mirtazapine - I have a GP appointment on Monday which I'm likely going to try and push for to maintain continunity, and also because I've generally seen that it is more tolerable in comparison to typical ADs.
I know there's plenty in the forums already about it, but if there's anyone that shares a diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome or Autistic Spectrum Disorder, I'd love to know how you've all gotten on with it, positive and negative (of course, if you don't have ASD, I'd still want to hear it just so I feel more 'prepared')

"Hello everybody here is my story,
I've been taking mirtazapine for 2 years now and started off at 15mg but my anxiety become more severe and was put up to 45mg . After being on mirtazapine(remeron) for about a year I decided to ween my way off them and got down to 7.5mg OK and this took me a couple of months and then decided to stop taking them completely. The first couple of weeks where great and it was like being my old self again, laughing , looking for new hobbies and generally feeling up beat about life and then it hit me , the anxiety had come back . It was even more severe than when I started taking mirtazapine , I felt like I was having a heart attack , couldn't keep still , couldn't sleep it felt like I was going mad so I decided that I needed to see the doctor again and he quickly put me back on mirtazapine with a weeks supply of zopiclone. So I'm still on mirtazapine now so when I decide to come off when I am more prepared.
So basically I need peoples advice if they have come off mirtazapine from a high dose after being on it for so long and what was there method best of coming off it
Many thanks

"Hi there I feel a bit of a fraud posting on here as I'm not using mits. But my partner is and I'm really scared. He's had MH problems for years. When we got together 3 years ago I wasn't aware of this, nor the fact he was an alcoholic. Anyway to cut a long boring story short he's now been put on mits for help with sleep and depression including and er issues he's nearly stopped drinking which is good because that fueled his anger and I was alway on receiving end. Anyway he's had 3 breakdowns in the time I've been with him which is the reason he's been put on mits. Since he's been on it he's been fantastic no real issues with anger. No violence towards me. I actually feel safe around him now. He's said that he's thinking of coming off them because he's always tired. I'm scared that if he comes off them his anger will flare up and get worse. He says he can't live with always feeling this tired. Please can someone tell me if this passes so I can try persuade him to keep taking them. I just don't know what to do. Before the tablets he was vile and I feared for my life. Now he's on them I feel so much better but he don't. I've read stuff on here saying when coming off them anger gets worse...I don't think I'm ready for that. But it's also not fair on him walking round like a zombie.will this be forever if he stays on them or does it get better. He's only been on mits a week and I can see the change the man I fell in love with is coming bk to me. In that week I've not been shouted at threatened or anything it's been bliss

"Hi everyone,
I suffer from panic attacks and health anxiety and citalopram & sertraline didn't help at all. I probably didn't give them long enough to kick in but the side effects made my health anxiety worse. 
So my GP has prescribed me with 15 mg of mirtazapine as i told her I didn't want another SSRI. ive checked side effects in my BNF book and I think I could deal with them. There's hardly any compared to others. 
What are people's experience on 15 mg when first start taking them? I want some relief but I don't want to feel really sleepy and fatigue at Christmas. Xxx

"Hi all been reading through many discussions on the forum since I was diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD.
I have been a pretty level head person throughout my life 12yrs in the army and worked since the day I got out.
Then around 3 months ago I did the Great North Run and after the event started to experience chest pains and light headness,convinced that I was having a heart attack I went straight to A&E to find out nothing was wrong however over the next few weeks I started to fall apart in the end before I finally cracked I had not eaten nor slept correctly for well over a week. I went to work one morning and broke, I was admitted into a care home and was seen by many people, during my stay I tried sertaline and cilitropan which made me feel worse so I refused to take them.
I pushed for myself to be released from the centre with the ambition of going back to work on the Monday which I did however I felt everyday was a battle I would climb a ladder and fall off by the night time.
I read forum after forum driving myself nuts to the stage of experiencing other peoples symptoms lol.
I visited my GP an reluctantly I tried 15mg of Mirtazipine which I have been on for 38 days during the time of this I went for an interview and landed a better job.
At present I still suffer from difficulty in breathing and dry mouth, choking sensation less often. The drug is not a miracle worker however it had helped me and I noticed a slight change within 14 days.
I realise that everyone faces there own battle everyday and you WILL get through it.
The reason for my post is to say keep your head held high there is no wonder drug and what works for me might not work for you but try to motivate yourself and keep busy is the key.
I wish you all the best on your journey

"As you may have seen through other posts I was prescribed mirtazapine but due to side effects of swelling and muscle ache my GP has changed them to Venlafaxine 75 mgs daily. I have taken them for 1 week now. Not had any problems switching from one to the other.  Yesterday I was at a christening and although at first I felt no one cared I quite enjoyed the day.
Today I didn't want to get up this morning, but I was due to for some voluntary work at a cafe. When I got to cafe I wasn't really needed. I could have stayed but we would have been falling over each other so I decided not to work. If I had done what I was normally used too doing I would have been ok, becsise i would have been busy and my mind would have been occupird, but because of the situation I just felt not wanted. Yes I know it was stupid to feel like that so I thought I would go and do some shopping. I managed to break a vase in a big chain store, staff were fine and said it didn't: matter and proceeded to clear it up. However all I did was stand there and started crying. I felt so stupid with myself. 
I eventually managed to compose myself enough to drive home. Now I am sat here thinking how do other people present with depression. I feel I am a one off and I wish it on myself. The thoughts I have when I am alone are always negative and that provokes a feeling I am doing myself no favours (which I know I am not,) but I just don't seem to help it. I just want to be happy but I am not. I have said too my GP I have wondered if I have a form of bipolar but I do not have the extreme highs.I just feel so low today I don't feel life is worth living.
Thanks for listening

"I have been in depression for quite a few years now with one adversity following other. Have been on Mirtazapine 15 mg for 5 days now. How long does it take to show benefits?
Resorted to meditation for healing self and keep myself going personally and financially. Now felt unable to carry on and felt like doing something drastic.
Went to the doctor last week to tryy out medication and was prescribed Mirtazapine 15 mg.
Slept well the 1st day but was restless the next. Hit the treadmill in the evenings from 3rd day for the fear of staying awake and the mind wandering. This helped me tire out and sleep, but feel totally down, frustrated, hopeless and angry during the day.

"I am bloody miserable, past week or so i have been restless as hell. Can't sit and watch a programme, read,for any length of time. I am 49 and freaking perimenopausal to boot.
Having a really hard time painting a happy face for all....i was so ill and just angry/frustrated yesterday i was screaming in pure rage,couldn't control it and then sobbed hysterically after for about an hour. Conteplated jumping from the window and wondering if it would hurt.....
Then my head changed again,and i forgot about it. This on/off,happy/sad stuff is driving me more nuts than what i was before. I can't work because of my depression, and have been on a few tabs in the past,but this is scary stuff that's happening to me and i wasn't sleeping, hadn't slept for three days straight, got a disturbed sleep last night... 
Not sure what's going to happen tonight. But it so exhausting. I have my 18yr old daughter with me,and i am scaring her,but my moods are never thesame in the space of sometimes minutes.

"Hi I've just been prescribed Mirtazapine and am a bit worried after reading some of the reports on here. Most here seem to start or only be on a low dosage and still have problems. I've been told to start on 30mg. No blood pressure etc. tests, just a perscription
I struggled with weight problems for a few years which added to my depression but have finally managed to loose one stone, but its taken me a whole year, so the thought of weight gain oviously worries me. I also have a low blood pressure which worries me. Just don't know what to do now.

"Hi all. I am new to this site but looking at discussions on here it seems to be a Godsend. I was prescribed mertazapine 2 weeks ago and had to stop taking almost immediately. I explained how bad I was feeling to my doctor and also told him I couldn't concentrate because of depression and I am at university where I have exams in 2 weeks. He prescribed mertazapine but became a walking shell with what seemed like no brain function. I stopped taking them but could not get another appointment. Finally after crying down the phone and pleading got to see a nurse who said that she would speak to the doctor and see what she could do. She asked if I would consider taking a lower dose to which I said no, a prescription was waiting for me of 15mg.
I feel that I have to chose between feeling void and zombified or being an emotional mess. Either way gonna fail. I did mention that I had to drive 50 miles to uni which is impossible on these so for now I am an emotional mess.
Previously I was on venlaglaxine but they seemed to have stopped working. I feel that neither the doctor or nurse listened, am sure my husband thinks I should get over it and have never felt so isolated and alone. There has to be something out there similar to venlaflaxine. Any ideas anyone as right now I just want to curl up in a ball and hibernate. Thanks x

"I've been on MT since it first came out in 1998, it proved to be a good AD for me after trying many others, no hot sweats,impotance, and it did help me sleep after many years of not being able to.
I was on 45mg until six months ago April 2014 then reduced to 30mg, Three weeks ago i decided enough is enough and cut doen to 15mg, untill Fri 22nd nov this year 2014 then i stopped alltogether, so now i'm five days without, and feeling good, just the odd queezy moment, and occasionall tearfull moment, 
The side effects are addictive, like being drugged at night and able to sleep as long as i went to bed within one hour of taking the pill, i was out like a light even after 16 years, but on the negative side i gained a massive amout of weight, i went from 12st to 22st in the first two years, but through lots of effort , and joining a ramblers group i am back down to 14st, but still need to lose another 2st now iv'e come off them i hope this will happen,
So far the effects of comming off seam to be mild, like some muscle spasms, feeling sick, slight panick attacks or anxiety, but iv'e managed to slleep well, and this was my main concern

"Hi all,
I previously asked what should I say to Dr. Well just returned from seeing him and (not at my request) he has decidrd to take me off mirtazapine 15 MG's which I have taken for 8 weeks now and prescribed Venlafaxine 75 MG's because of the increase in side effects, I have suffered with swelling to feet and legs as soon as I started on mirt then in last 4 weeks I have suffered with muscle ache and tingling sensation yo fingers.
What I am asking is what effects may occur switching medication. I have heard some people have terrible withdrawals from the mirt. I cannot reduce the mitt as I don't have any tablets left. I am unsure what time to take the Venlafaxine. I am under no illusions that everything will go smoothly (although I can live in hope), 
Advice will be greatly received. I have to see him again in 4 weeks.( Oh that will be Christmas !!!!)
I do not have a psychiatrist.

"Hi...
Just came onto this site as a matter of curiosity as I have now been taking Mirtazapine for just under a week and thought I might compare my experience with other people's.
First of all I should say that I have been suffering from some pretty severe anxiety stemming from panic attacks (which has lasted about 8 months now) so that is the main reason I had been prescribed these tablets, though I have definately been experiencing some pretty heavy depression at times which I believe to be a side-effect of feeling so anxious for so long. Ironically I had been avoiding taking any anti-depressant medication because I was so anxious about the prospect of the medication making me even more anxious as a result of taking it! Such is the nature of an anxiety illness of course - it just feeds on itself and makes you think all sorts of anxious thoughts!
Anyway, the reason I finally decided to take medication is because I reached a stage within my anxiety/depression where I felt that things just weren't getting better naturally as I had hoped they might. I had tried taking St. John's Wort to no avail and although I definately experienced some overall improvement as time went by, it was very up and down and the obsessive nature of my anxious thoughts just kept holding me back. So, having had these Mirtazapine pills sitting on my shelf for so long, I figured it might just be time to give them a go. I know a few other people who have been through some pretty difficult times for various reasons and have taken anti-depressant medication as a result, all of whom are now off the meds and back to living a normal life - and some of the people I'm talking about had been taking them for up to 3 years.
Well, after almost a week of taking Mirtazapine (1x 15mg tablet a night) I can safely say that they have helped so far. Within 24 hours of taking them I already felt some sort of a 'lift' in my mood and definately noticed a more positive feeling within. I was also extremely tired with it and for the first couple of days, I felt like I could sleep forever. This wasn't such a bad thing however as the feeling of tranquil lethargy and the benefit of a good sound night's sleep was a welcome change from feeling so anxious all the time. In any case, I was aware of this potentially happening as my Doctor did inform me that Mirtazapine has a sedative effect (hence the reason for taking it at night before bed) and it also says something to that effect on the information leaflet you get with the tablets. The extreme tiredness only lasted for a couple of days, though a week in I still feel pretty tired throughout the day but it's not so much of a lethargy as just feeling like you have to shut your eyes because they are so heavy. It does come and go though and it's worth mentioning that I have to get up at 06:30 every morning and then have a 1 and a half hour commute to work so that will inevitably affect how tired I am during the week as well.
Additionally, I have noticed an increase in appetite (also mentioned in the side-effects list) and have been eating a bit more of late but it's the kind of thing that you can keep tabs on as long as you stay aware of how much you're shoving into your gob! I think the best thing for that is to make sure that if and when you do feel the urge to eat, you just make sure you eat something healthy and avoid the decadent snacks.
Other than that, I have felt a little light-headed at times and on occasion a little foggy, like I'm having trouble processing or vocalising my thoughts, but on the whole it has been a far less traumatic experience than I originally anticipated.
As for the main reason I started on Mirtazapine - well my low mood much improved, and the anxiety although still somewhat apparent is not nearly as intense as it was before. Although I still have the anxious thoughts, they are intermittent rather than constant and feel like they are round the corner somewhere rather than right there in my face, if you know what I mean. More importantly, for the first time in ages I feel like I can do things without the dreaded trepidation of old which is a huge boost to my everyday life. I also feel hope as opposed to the sense of despair and isolation that the depression can cause.
It is still early days yet - I understand that it can take up to 6 weeks for anti-depressants to have their full effect - but so far so good. I have still to go back and see my Doctor about my progress to discuss dose etc but if it goes on as it is then I think my inner anxiety demons will just fade into the past and I should be well on my way to being normal again.
Well I hope this sharing of my experience serves to help anyone reading this who may have concerns about taking Mirtazapine or starting anti-depressant medication in general. Obviously side effects and experiences vary from person to person but I'm sure some positive feedback will do no harm.
Give me a holler at ****** if you want to talk some more about it... I'm happy to share any info etc.
Take care!

" Sept my GP decided to change my antidepressants from Fluoxetine 60mgs to Mirtazepine as I was having trouble sleeping and anxiety and depression deteriorating. In dec i started an 18 week  course of CBT which really helped at the start but unfortunately because of unforseen circumstances sessions had to be cancelled on several occasions with several weeks between therapy. Anxiety had started to deteriorate before CBT finished in July but I wanted to give it ago. 
Since starting on mirtazepine approx 6 weeks ago sleeping has improved despite vivid dreams, i do not feel as depressed anxiety more controlled but I  have suffered with swelling to feet and ankles, which subsides at night but within minutes of standing become swollen again, breathlessness, muscle fatigue, some slight stiffness in joints particularly fingers. I have seen my GP once since starting mirtazepine he is aware of the swelling but nothing else. I am due to see him again at the end of the month. i just don't know what to do, i hate these side effects as they sre making me feel older than my age, i am wondering whether i should try stopping medication altogether

"Hello.
I have been talking Mirtazapine for just over 2 years now .I started at 15mg and progressed up to 45mg, and have just started the 45mg.
I have found it a wonderful drug for my depression, and started taking it after a miserable experience with fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and Dosulepin over many months. It has kept me stable, reasonably calm and positive for some 2 years now.
The weight gain was non-existent -until I passed the 2 year mark!Suddenly it seems to be happening, as I am not eating any more than when I started.Oh well.
Also, the drug seemed to lose potency recently and that is why I have upped to 45mg.Only now do I feel the detachment and muzzy thinking I have read on so many other experiences.I hope it passes.
Overall, the drug has been the best AD for me and has,I think, contributed to a period of stability.I hope it can help others too.

"Hey everyone,
Click here to view image
I'm not discrediting those people who have had a really hard time, just want a positive one out there for people looking for info when they start coming off so they maybe don't get so scared!
So I have been on Mirtazapine for 8 months, 1 month on 15mg, 1 month on 30mg then the other 6 months on 45mg, I took it for panic disorder and my terrible anxiety.
After 8 months I found that it was making me feel very down, unable to concentrate (I am a uni student in my third year so I need to stay sharp) and that it wasn't doing much for my anxiety so I decided to lower to 15mg again and then if I wasn't feeling any results come off it completely and maybe try something else.
So I went from 45mg down to 30mg for three weeks, the first four days I had a bit of nausea (on a scale of 1 - 10 only about 6) and found in the mornings I needed to poop a lot but I always felt fine by the afternoon. These symptoms only lasted the first four days and then I was fine, but I stayed on 30mg for three weeks to be safe. I noticed immediately I was feeling much less cloudy in my brain and less irritable, on 45mg I was having INSANE menstrual pain and PMS (crying every day I had my period) and this all seemed to ease once back on 30mg.
Then I went down to 15mg, again the first four days I had the poops in the morning and a bit of nausea (only on the first day this time).
I have been on 15mg for a week now and still feel pretty much fine, it seems to be only the first couple of days I felt ill before I bounced back. Going to stay on 15mg for another two weeks just to make sure I'm clear and to decide whether or not to come off entirely.
I haven't noticed any rebound anxiety when lowering as well, I have intense panic attacks that unfortunately made a comeback while I was still on the medication (which is why I am considering coming off to go on something else) but it definitely hasn't become worse throughout this process.
I did have all the side effects coming on, couldn't move for being so groggy and tired for the first few weeks on and eating like there was no tomorrow as well as the ongoing menstraul pain (so bad that I would just lay in bed feeling sick from the pain all day)! So I was expecting this to be way harder than it was. Who knows what the effects will be when I go down to 0 but that is a bridge I will cross when I am ready and going by the withdrawal so far I am not expecting it will be too terrible.
All I have done to ease this process is I drink at least four large (750ml) bottles of water each day (which I do anyway) to stay hydrated and flush my system as quickly as possible, also when you have been constantly going to the toilet like I did those first few days it's key to make sure you are drinking enough water or you are going to feel much worse as you get more dehydrated.  I have also been eating a can of tuna every day for those first four days (even when I haven't had much of an appetite) for some Omega 3 goodness, I'm probably going to get a bottle of fish oil tablets for when I come off entirely as my Dr suggested the Omega 3 would help and it seems to be helping so far.
I will come back and post again after the 3 weeks on 15mg to let you know how I am feeling and if I do decide to come off the Mirt entirely, I am taking it as a slow and steady process as now on the lower doses the side effects are pretty minimal and I want to see if this amount will start helping my anxiety again before I ditch it completely. Luckily my Dr and my psychologist have been incredibly supportive and helpful and said to just go with what my body is telling me week by week.
So in summary, although unfortunately a lot of people on here have had a really raw deal and all the terrible withdrawal symptoms while tapering off mirt it isn't going to happen for everybody, so be prepared for the worst but not expecting it, because you may not feel anything or you may jst get a few days of mild symptoms like I did.
I hope this was helpful! 
Good luck to anyone out there going through this process as well!

"I have been taking mirtazepine 45mg for 6 years along with sertraline 50mg and Topiramate 100mg. I have decided that it is time to start the long process of coming off the meds and am starting with the mirtazepine. I have got as far as trying to reduce the 30mg to 15mg and withdrawal symptoms are kicking in such as aching muscles, mucus in the throat (constantly having to clear my throat) but by far the worst, insomnia - whole nights sometimes leading to time off work.

"I am posting here because I can't think of a more appropriate place for doing so - and any suggestions would be welcome.
I have probably had tinnitus for quite a long while. I have been on various meds including mirtazapine and Lithium.
Has anyone found that they seem to have developed tiimitus as a result of being on one or other psychiatric medication.
I have just had my ears syringed and it is no better. If anyone wants to know how to test for it - or whether they have got it - say put your hands over your ears - if you can still hear something then you have got it - in my case it is a whooshing.
Internet sites say that it can be caused by stress - last night I had been to a party and afterwards I noticed it.
I aso notice it when I am lying in bed alone - particularly when I am not particularly tired - last week I had to get up and do a Sudoku to get more tired!
I have found on a NHS website that there are NHS tinnitus counsellors.
I would welcome any feedback, any pointers to other resources or any help that people can give.
To be honest I used to tell it myself  that it was the blood coursing round my brain - and I was just hearing what everyone else did - for some reason I have only just become so conscious of it.

I'm actually looking for a bit of reassurance.
I was on Mirtazapine 15mg for 6 days and on a increased dose of 30mg for 19 days.
I am sleeping now most nights and my appetite has increased a little. My anxiety and expression have decreased a tiny bit but nothing major. I still feel very anxious,negative and depressed when I first wake. 
I've had some ok days and some bad days but haven't had no days where I'm feeling and thinking "" normal"" or believing that there is a end to feeling like this.
Am I expecting to much too soon? 
I would appreciate some good feedback as I thing my mind is a little to fragile right now to hear any horror stories.

"Hi,
I've been on 7.5mg mirtazapine for over two months now after a break of two months and it's been ok apart from getting flashes of light in my eyes at least couple of times a day (which I had checked and the dr said I now have a higher pressure in the eyes which may cause it) and in the last week I have developed something that I remember one of my doctors described as being conected to the mains (something you may expect as a side effect from mirtazapine). I didn't have any other symptoms which could indicate anxiety but now I started to worry as I'm about to travel with my little son. I also feel like there is some pressure in my head as my ears hurt sometimes and the tinnitus (potentialy caused by mirtazapine withdrawal that went wrong) is louder. Please can you let me know if you've experienced something like that?

"I’ve been reading all the comments on Mirtazapine, most of them negative. I’ve looked it up on the web, and everyone’s undesirable side effects are listed and more. I have epilepsy and the 2 drugs I take cause major depression and Mirtazapine has helped. But it does have undesirable side effects like others have been going through: weight gain, although I go for walks, constipation, and trouble urinating. Some have suggested drinking cranberry juice and I’ll try it before my urologist does an intrusive procedure. I once had massive constipation that required treatment at the ER and I think Mirtazapine was the culprit and so did the doctor at the ER. It can also cause low blood pressure. Mine use to be excellent, but now it’s 98/58 and I don’t want to go on one more med to counteract the effects of one more drug, and another one to counter the effects of the new drug. It gets to the point of where I think I should own my own pharmacy or just let nature take its course and go insane for the better. By the way, I’m an American and found out that one stone (not pot) is equal to 14 pounds. I’ll raise you 2 stones. (ha, ha). By the way, if you have a neurological disorder, you can look up neurologynow on the web. They have excellent articles for patients. I did a search for Mirtazapine but there were no results. Don’t give up!

"I'm weaning off Effexor XR atm with a view to moving on to Mirtazapine in the next few days. I did a phone consultation with my doctor (wasn't meant to see him for 3 months) to tell him that the effect it was having on my sleep was intolerable + since I'd tried citalopram and fluoxetine with any gains, he opted for this.
My concern is the weight gain, which is a side effect I wasn't aware of when he'd suggested it, or I would have asked for something different. I'm already on the wrong side of overweight, and it's a pretty key factor in my mental health because of my low self esteem concerning my appearance. Are there any suggestions for combating this effect? Or is it not worth it & should I just go back to my doctor and explain this?

"So, to sum it all up: there are 3 internationa organizations trying to help people come off ad. The road back, point of return and Cita.
The first two suggest to taper off by decreasing the drug at a 10 per cent rate avery two weeks. Cita also suggests a very interesting tapering plan by alternating doses.
After reading almost everything on the web about mirtazapine (I'm now at 11.5) I know that:
1) Many people jump from 45 to 0 without problems. It's as if the drug would taper itself off
2) Many people found difficult to jump from even 1mg to 0
3) People who jump from 7.5 to 0 suffer like crazy
4) there is a scientific evidence that also jumping from a minimum dose to 0 can create problems: Studies prove that sert occupancy remains at 80% even at low doses
5) The WS hits you 8 days or 2 weeks after a decrease in dosage.
5) Which leads me to believe that may be the CITA protocol is the best oone...Since even a small reduction can create a problem...It would be best to alternate doses to allow the drug to abandon the body gradually...
Please have a look at the charts about Mirta and tell me what you think.

"Last week I came off Mirtazapine immediately after my psychiatrist told me to. I knew of the sedative effect but then having not taken mirt in the evening about 10 days ago I realised that I could pee much easier in the morning. Previously it had been extraordinarily difficutl. Obviously this is something that one notices immediately. I emailed my psychiatrist and he iimmediately told me to come off. I have been taking 15 mg and I did not taper off. I have just stopped takin them. I should stress that my psych is clearly happy with my progress such that he has said that if I feel I need it I can just go to my GP for an anti-depressant.
That comes to the question of my GP - he is supposed to be a general practitioner. That iss he takes general care of me - he is not an expert in psychiatry. But I don't now have a care-coordinator from the hospital, he is supposed to perform that role. Yet when not so long ago I went to him about mirt I think it was, possibly commenting about its sedative effect. he said that that was what my psych had  prescribed and, looking at me terribly sincerely at me he said that he couldn't do anything about it. Well, my sister is a GP and Idon't recall if she had advised me so, but I looked back at him and asked to put something in my notes which he did so reluctantly.
If the GP doesn't write anything about it, the psych won't know. I assume that then my psychiatrist can look at my GP's notes and see this. Can someone clarify this for me?
What I do know is that when my psych writes to my GP after my meeting with him, the psych faxes him. 1 Why can't he email my GP? 2 Why can't he attach the letter to my patient notes in the practice from his PC? I thught that the hospital were able to see my GP's notes and vice versa. I do know that when I have been to the Intermediate Treatment Hosp they haven't been able to see my GP/hospital notes.
Going back to the problem with peeing - am I right that this is a male problem - I have reported this on a number of occasions to my GP. Once he tested my prostate which is the obvious source of such a problem. He reported that it didn't seem too large implying that there wasn't any point doing anything about it for the time being. I have been off mirt for about 2 weeks now and I haven't thought another thing about my peeing problem. I don't need to tell you that once something like that has gone away it is difficult to imagine the difficulty that I was in previously.
As I say the GP is a generalist but he should be looking out for such things. Now one is able to look up such things on the Internet fortunately,
For a long whike I have been having problems with general aches and pains - the sort of things that one gets as one gets older. I was getting cramps in my back/thigh area such that I had difficulty getting up from my bed in the morning. I have suddenty realised that I have no more backpains. It is really miraculous. Even the stiffness in my neck has almost gone. I can turn my neck almost without any twinges.
This was causing such a problem that I have been given a referral to a physio. I will take up the appointment but it looks as though I won't need it. In fact, this was proving such a problem that my sister, the GP. had suggested that I should see an orthopaedic or nerve specialist.
So much for joined up treatment. I have come to the conclusion that my GP is a waste of space. Fortunately he has a junior partner who seems more thorough. I have come to the conclusion that my GP just wants a cushy life. He treats conservatively - which means less work for him. On one occasion when I was less well my sister actually had to ring him up to suggest a particular treatment to him. He was reluctant to do so. I now sometimes say when I see him, that my sister said etc and that does move him. Pity the porr person who doesn't have a relation who is a doctor. Another realtion said that if he refers to the hospital then this comes out of his budget.
But I am not going to change doctors at the moment which I have thought about. If I go to a new GP they will not know about me - I will be having to explain my history and the doctor might not be any better, Unfortunately people with psychiatric problems are probably not given the respect that general patients receive so that any comments are not treated with the degree of seriousness that they would be given otherwise.
Finally I am 60. One reads that there is a problem with middle-aged men not taking their health seriously. Well, there also seems a problem, certainly in the case of my GP, of not taking the health of this middle-age man seriously.
There are a number of other things I don't understand about my GP.

It's probably because I entered a web address & 'phone no.  I rang my supplier's medical info. line yesterday and reported my own difficulties and the fact that there are a lot of unhappy people out here trying to come off Mirtazapine.  The manufacturers underplay the problems (of course, don't want them taken off the market!).
I suggest you ring the medical info. line of whoever supplies/makes your drug and let them know just what's happening for you.

"I have started to take Mirtazipine (lowest dose, of 15mg) a week ago. It has solved my long-term problem of insomnia. However, I feel very drowsy all the time. I therefore take a nap for about two hours in the daytime, and, despite that, after 8pm or so I can hardly keep my eyes open. So I'm back to bed fairly early (say, 10pm) and then getting up at about 10am.
I have got responsibilities and can't continue to live like this, wasting so much time sleeping and not feeling sharp when I am awake.
I have read widely about the medication and the lethargy and drowsiness is a common side-effect, but it says in some places that this side-effect subsides over time.
To what extent does the feeling of lethargy and drowsiness reduce over time? Is it significant or minor please?
If it is significant, then it may be worth me persisting with the drug, but if it is only a slight reduction I can't go on like this and am considering trying a more natural remedy like St John's Wort.
Your advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks very much.

"Hello all,
I've searched the Web for an answer but can't seem to find the right one...
I have been on Mirtazapine for 16 months and just had a baby 2 months ago. I decided to come off Mirtazapine as it was a nightmare for night feeds and my mental health has really improved, basically I felt ready to move on. I cut down from 30mg to 15mg for 2 weeks, then stopped completely on the advice of my doctor. 
For 2 weeks I felt great, then started feeling rotten. Headache constantly, nausea, dizziness, extremre fatigue, itchy swollen eyes and allergy symptoms. This sounds like Mirtazapine withdrawal. 
2 weeks later I still feel like this. My doctor didn't warn me about this, and I have my beautiful baby to take care of. It's upsetting to say the least. My doctor has since left and her replacement was of no help. 
Does anyone know how long I can expect this to last
last? Mentally I am fine apart from being upset that I'm ill and can't do what I need to do. I'm on no other
meds. 
If someone could help or advise I would be so grateful, I don't want to get too down about it, but I'm so worried this will go on and on. I really don't want to restart my meds,.it's time to go medication free for me.
Thankyou for reading x

"Hi all, fairly new here so hoping for some guidance. Have been on mirtazapine for just over a week after a psychiatrist suggested I try them in addition to 20 mg escitalopram which I have been on for a year or so after citalopram failed me.
I have the standard side effects of a sweet tooth and wanting to sleep for 12 hours plus but I believe my physch will be increasing the dose to 45. I'm conscious of what to expect. I'm currently off work but hoping to return in the next week or so but will the increase knock me for 6. I'm a 35 yr old male suffering from anxiety and depression but don't want to be a zombie with no feelingsAny experience would be greatly welcomed as I have read some confusing stories with some saying 45 was too much and others saying the higher the dose the less sedating effect. Any responses welcome thanks

"Hello
I previously took 50mg citalopram which had depression dealt with perfectly but I couldn't cope with the sweating side effect.  Citalopram was reduced back to 40mg but I was then feeling the effects of the depression.  Started taking Mirtazapine 15mg in the evenings (alongside 40mg citalopram in the morning) and the depression seems to be under control again.  When i'm awake i feel good - but i'm needing to sleep for up to 12 hours a day which is clearly not sustainable.  I've been taking them for 4 weeks now and wondered if this is just a side effect and if the need to sleep for so long will reduce soon?
Thanks

"First of all let me say I've had 4 episodes of depression in my adult life (I'm now 62) and in between I'm a positive and fortunately very fit and healthy. When I fell I'll last time 2 years ago I was severely depressed within a short space of time. . I was put on mirtazapine fairly early on by GP with sleeping tabs a lso. I still only slept for 3hrs a night.
It took 4months to get a referral to a psychiatrist each day a live g he'll of total fear and hiding away and not wanting to do anything.
The psychiatrist treated me in his own words aggressively with 4 different drugs. 1 antipsychotic 2xads mirtazapine and escatalpram and zopiclone. After 2 months after that I started getting better. It took 4months to get so the mornings were better. The one thing I would say is that the Mirtazapine helped me to get a longer deeper sleep the I had do e for years before being ill.
I'm still slowly coming down in dose of 30mgs at night.
The one thing I've learned about depression is that you can have removed any source of conflict or anxious cause and it is very physical not just mental.

"Hi folks , I've been on codiene phosphate 180mg a day for 4 years. Not by choice but because of different things, child birth, stairs, falling over and IBS I've needed it for pain relief. Now the doctors haven't taken me off it, soooo I went to the doctors this morning and asked to be taken off it, that was scary, because admittedly I like how the codiene makes me feel but I know I need to come off it.
I'm usually on 60mg 3 times a day of codiene and at night I take 4 sleeping tablets too.
The nurse practitioner has reduced my codiene to 30mg 3 times a day and completely stopped my.sleeping tablets. This is the case for 1 week then I gave to go back every week for about 16.
In place of my sleeping tablets she has given me mirtazipine. I've never heard of it until today and I'm quite scared of how it's going to make me feel.
I'm at work tomorrow 11-5, mcdonalds and I'm not sure what time to take my mirtazipine tonight as I don't know how I'll feel tomorrow.
Any info on how this has made people feel please let me know.

"Hi
I've been on mirtazapine for about a year after switching from citalopram. I started on 15mg thrn moved to 30mg which I was on for about 6 months. 
Having tapered off over the course of about 3 weeks I took my last pill 6 weeks Ago.
Withdrawal symptoms have included nausea, confusion, insomnia and low mood but nothing I couldn't handle.
Over the last few days I've had increasing body pain and this has culminated in being in a lot of pain and quite a high fever. I just wanted to ask what others experiences had been, could this be withdrawals kicking in after 6 weeks or have I got flu?!

"Hi, my story
6 MONTHS AGO I woke up in another terrifying world, the World of an anxiety disorder.
I learned all about this dibilitating disorder but never tried a med route out of it, never even went to doctors. Tried self help and I know the way out is acceptance. I wont go into the details of that if you are a sufferer you will have heard about that. Basically adding fear to thoughts, brought on by a high and prolonged period of stress results in a constantly on adrenaline rush.
The creates an illusion in ones mind, but also the hormone causes all the normal sensations in ones body to become heightened.
So you become normal but with a burned up  nervous sysytem

"I was prescribed this drug when in the deepest, darkest, treatment-resistant depression ever. The (very wise) doc I was seeing started me on 7.5 mg only. This not only made me sleep like there was no tomorrow (I had been almost total insomniac for months) but also lifted me out of depression in spectacular fashion. So I stayed on that dose for about 2 months and then just stopped. Now I'm not saying the experience will be the same for you, but merely an advice to watch the dosage - if you can keep it down then the side-effects will be much reduced, apart from the weight gain which seems to come irrespective of dose!

"Came off 15mg of mirt gradually, over a month or so having Bern on it for about 4 months for depression and sleep problems. Came off because I had zero motivation to do anything, total lacklustre, but they did help with my sleep, which has been a problem for many years but has got worse.
I found that when I started cutting back to 7.5 and even half that my sleep was still ok and my motivation, while not what I wanted was definitely better on such low dose than on 15mg.
Now that been off for a month sleep is very bad, and this is now making my depression come back with a vengeance. I was almost at point of being scared of going to bed as knew wasn't going to get to sleep, but when on mirt, knee I would get sleep even on small dose. Now seriously thinkin of going back to 7.5. Thoughts, advice?
As I say had problems many years with sleep so this is NOT brought about by not having the mirt, been like this with sleep for 15years, and I do function better with sleep as we all do I guess. Not going back onto 15mg, but 7.5, maybe

"Hi, my doctor took me off fluoxetine a few months ago and put me on 15mg of mirtazapine as I was having problems sleeping.  They worked brilliantly in the beginning but for the last couple of weeks I have been waking during the night again and I wake up feeling so tired and dopey.  I am really forgetful, feel brain fogged and a bit like I have a hangover even though I haven't been drinking.  I'm not driving as I don't feel safe to drive as I have been making silly mistakes like stopping at green lights and taking wrong turns because I can't concentrate.  Does anyone know why this would happen months after starting the meds?
I'm not sure if the mirtazapine aren't working any longer and whether they need increasing or if my depression has got worse or if it's my perimenopause symptoms.  When my gp first put me on fluoxetine 5 years ago she said it was depression not perimenopause.
I am so confused about all this, my gp is on holiday until next Monday, I really wanted to speak to her about it but I'm not sure I can wait that long feeling like this.

My doc gave me  Mirtazapine 15mg to try, I took one last night and slept 12ish hours. Normally i only sleep 6 or so hours.
This was great but now its 3pm and i still feel extremly tired, i cannot train as i feel 'out of it' and confused, lethargic.
This is casuing me even more anxiety as i have worked very hard and love training. I no longer want to take this pill for these reasons. Also i cannot afford to put lots of weight on as i need to stay fit for my sport.
What do i do? i loved the fact it knocked me out for a night but without training i will go insane and i have games on the weekend.

"I have been on Mirtz for 2 weeks, before that Sertraline for two weeks (short stint as couldn't hack the insomnia) and before that Citalopram for about 5 months. 
I feel like Mirtz has helped in that I'm now sleeping in a normal pattern and I can function. I can leave my house and go to things social and work whereas before it was a struggle. 
I'm concerned that I don't care about anything though, I feel like I have no emotion. I don't get excited for things I should and although I can physically get myself to work I don't have motivation to be there and don't care about anything. I don't recognise the person I am now and it scares me. I just want to be 'me' again. I can't find anyone on Mirtz saying it helped them to become happy, just to function like I have found. I'm gaining weight, nothing fills me up and as a comfort eater anyway that scares me particularly as a lot of my issues are around my size and my looks (superficial but true) 
I'm considering coming off it altogether and seeing if that helps me to find 'me' again? Has anyone else tried this? I have only been on it two weeks and only 15mg so I don't imagine I would have a massive withdrawal. 
Any opinions welcome?

"Today I have been given 15mg Mirtazapine for the first time. From reading reviews I'm very concerned about taking them mainly due to the weight gain many people experienced.
I'm a 31 year old female and other than the pass 2 years I have always been overweight (18 stone). I'm now 11 stone which I'm comfortable with.
I have been given Mirtazapine as following operations and maybe more to come I have been suffering with very low self esteem mentally & physically. 
I know the medication has been given to help but I'm worried if I am to gain weight I will feel even lower about myself. I have told this to my GP who has advised he will weigh me in 2 months to see if weight has been gained.
By reading your reviews the weight gain seems to happen very rapidly.
Your opinions and thoughts are greatly appreciated

"Some advice would be great please. I've been sufferering from severe depression for a number of years now. I've dabbled a bit with therapy, but I'm not a great believer that it can help me. I was prescribed Sertraline about a year ago but after being on it for a couple of months and having the dosage upped, I suffered from serotonin syndrome and came straight off it (Doctors orders). She prescribed me Mirtazapine but it's been sat in the drawer ever since...nearly a year now. 
My depression is now the worst it's ever been. I've booked an appointment with my Dr but she's on holiday till september so it's not for another 3 weeks. My partner says I need to be on tablets now, rather than waiting (he's suffered from, and beaten depression and can't understand why I can't do the same) but he just doesn't understand how bad a reaction I had to tablets last time and therefore doesn't understand why I don't want to just start them - especially with my Dr being away (I don't want to see a locum). He's also pushing me to try therapy as the combination of tablets and that worked for him.
Any advice would be appreciated - what are others take on starting Mirtazapine please and has anyone suffered from serotonin syndrome whilst on this tablet?
Thanks in advance.

"Okay here goes. I've been reading the threads on this site for many months and have found everyone to be encouraging and knowledgeable but I'm unable to find an answer about long term mirtazapine use and how it helps, rather than it's hundreds of side effects! Please enlighten me... 
So quick background (as quick as I can anyway!) 
I have been depressed about a year but only addressed it just after Xmas when I found I couldn't cope anymore. 
After being stubborn about meds for a couple of months I was prescribed citalopram in March and at first it was amazing. I couldn't believe how happy I was I'd forgotten what that felt like nothing seemed to bother me or get me down it was fab (I've since thought this might have been a 'mania high' side effect I have just hoped not ha!) 
Anyway this sustained for a couple months then I crashed and slowly went back downhill to a point where I didn't see the point in taking the pills anymore. I assumed I'd just have my dosage upped (I was on 20mg which I think is low) but the doctor switched me to sertraline 50mg. This was about a month ago. 
I was on them for about 2 weeks with no sleep at all, I've never had insomnia like it felt like a zombie all day but too alert to sleep at night. My depressive symptoms didn't seem to subside either but I figured it was early days for that. 
I went back to doc on Monday didn't see my regular doc as on leave and I thought maybe I'd get something to help me sleep but she switched me to 15mg mirtazapine instead.
My sleep has improved I'm sleeping through the night which is great and yesterday I was up and about and I went out for a swim and felt good but today I woke from 10 hours sleep still feeling tired, on edge, irritable, slept two more hours then still felt the same had another hour and I've woken up still feeling miserable, groggy, horrible. 
I am trying to find an account of someone who's been on mirtazapine a while but can only find people either withdrawing or only on it a few days like me? 
Please tell me if it gets better, how it gets better please? All I can find are side effects no good accounts?! 
I'm so sick of feeling like this (I'm sure you all relate) I used to be so bubbly and happy and now I'm just boring and miserable. I feel like everyone else is having a life and I'm just sitting in bed day after day. I'm supposed to be going to the races tomorrow and v festival next weekend both things I was looking forward to so much and had do much fun at last year but now they just fill me with dread and fear. I can't keep cancelling on my friends. Most know my situation but I fear people are starting to lose interest and feel like I'm not helping myself and I could just snap out of it but I can't! 
Please tell me some good things about mirtazapine .... !! Thank you

"I would value any comments anyone has about their experience whilst withdrawing from Mirtazapine.
I have been taking it for two years now, being prescribed it for very early waking with horrendous anxiety. Unfortunately ir did nothing for the early morning waking, or the anxiety, but I continued on doctors advice in the hope that it would work. Started on 15mg, increased to 30 mg and when the doctor wanted to up the dose to 45mg I realised that this drug was really not for me. As I am OK during the day (anxiety just 1st thing) I can't think that I am depressed so decided a few months ago to very gradually withdraw, taking the last tablet four weeks ago.
The first two weeks I felt fine and then on third week it hit me like a brick wall full on. Anxiety much much worse in a morning and now, even lasting until about luch time (never had that before!). My doctor tells me that the effects of Mirtazapine should be out of my system after two weeks and that it is a return of the anxiety. As it never left me in the first place I am inclined to think that it is withdrawal symptoms, together with itchy skin, nausea and loss of appetite. I would really value any comments or experiences anyone has had when coming off these terrible drugs.

"Hi, i need some advice on weight gain whilst on Mirtazapine. 
I have been prescribed 15mg for 2 weeks for depression which has lead to severe weight loss Iam 5'5 and weigh just under 7 stone which makes me look horrible, so horrible I can hear people talk about me in the street, I look terrible. Before taking the medication I was aware of my weight and have always made special efforts to eat regular but still could not maintain a good weight. I have only been on mirtazapine for a few days, and have a follow up appointment in 2 weeks to see how I'm getting on and maybe to up my dosage. I haven't had any hunger cravings like I have heard people talk about and I'm really worried that I'm going to be the only person ever not to gain weight from these meds. My weight really adds to my depression and stops me going out the house, I want to gain 2-3 stone. But don't think this would be possible as I already eat a good amount of food every day.

i have been following A tapering plan whereby I drop down a dose one or two days per week over about 3-4 weeks, depending  on how I have felt. I have done really well, and not really had any side effects whilst doing this, other than some disturbed sleep, but managed.
Well I got a bit over confident and dropped my last drop over two weeks, and the past two weeks I started getting nervousness, slight loss of appetite, and disturbed/difficult sleep, but this past week I've had anxiety, nausea, and very disturbed sleep! 
I have stopped dropping, and remained at 0.1.5ml ( I'm using the liquid version), how long will it take to stabilise and when people say stabilise do they mean you get to a point where you can handle the symptoms, or the symptoms subside?
id appreciate any advice?

"It is iinteresting to read comments and views about drinking on Mirtazipine . I up until now would never drink on medication that specifically says avoid alcohol however...I have been on these tablets for a number of years after suffering a very serious breakdown.I have managed to start drinking occasionally and after going on holiday and drinking double measures I became quite violently sick.I did ask advice before going away and my drs advice was to go and enjoy myself . I find I am unable to drink no more than 2 or 3 at the most drinks with this medication..and I have heard that the problem with mixing alcohol with this medication is respiratory problems while asleep if mixed.So my advice to anyone is listen to your body if in doubt avoid .It affects everyone differently and unfortunately I am a light weight on this medication .Safer than sorry I guess..and in all honisty the first time I did drink on this medication I reacted quite bad.

"Hi everyone, i am currently taking remeron as a sleep aid. The dose that was prescribed to me was 7.5 but i never take that much. I normally take a quarter of that and some times a half dose. I only take it as needed. My question is do you guys think that such a low dose (quarter 1.87) really does anything?

"Ive been on 30mg of Mirtazapine for almost 3 weeks now, and while I did occasionally experience the rare black out (loss of hearing, pins and needles in face, vision white out) for a few minutes after strenous excercise, it didnt happen enough for me to suspect it was the mirtazapine causing it, I always justified these events as due to not eating correctly, lack of sleep, etc. However, since Ive increased the dose these have been happening a lot more, totally unrelated to excercise, just wondering if anyone else has been getting this kind of reaction?

"Hi,
   I was addicted to certain painkillers for 5 years and the last 2 years of that I was under the guidance of my doctor and a specialist in addiction. I reguarly suffer from depression and when I cam out of rehabilitation past December everything seemed to be ok until a couple of weeks later my system started reacting to the withdrawal medication and the anti depressants ( Fluoxotine/Prozac ). The doctor prescribed me Mirtazipine and they did work for a while after I was upped to 45mg daily and I wouls split this into 3 15mg a day morning,noon and night but after a while I started feeling unwell and suicidal and from the moment I woke up I watched the clock until it was time to goto bed as that was the only way I could have peace. I got taken off these and put onto the highest dose of Sertreline but these tablets made me even worse and the suicidal thoughts were on my mind all day everyday and it was a constant battle to stop myself from doing anything.
After one appointment which I took my wife with me to the specialist doctor who deals with my recovery the doctor realised I was telling the truth about how I felt as my wife described everything to her. The specialist doctor told me to stop the Sertreline straight away and started me on 30mg of Mirtazipine again. I've been on these for about 5-6 weeks now and I'm currently still off work sick due to how these tablets make me feel. I dread waking up everyday as it's always the same now matter what I do to keep myself occupied. I still have these suicidal thoughts and just want to disappear and things to end and it's draining. The Mirtazipine do help but I think it's because of the sleeping agent within these tablets which calm me and kind of knock me out to sleep for a few hours. I don't want to be on these anymore but I don't want to start any other medication as this type of medication usually takes 4-6 weeks to work and to be blunt occupational health stated last time that my employers could pay me off through ill health which doesn't help with my anxiety. I'm at a loss as to what to do now as every day it seems to just get worse. Sorry for the ramble and long story. I just wish i never took those 2 little tablets for a headache as that's what started all this as 2 tablets led to 80-120 + painkiller addiction a week.

"Hi
Just some background.....  I have been signed off work for the last 6 months with depression.  I was prescribed Proxac, the dose of which was doubled after a few weeks, but I didn't find it helped with my anxiety.
A trip to Morrisons puts me in panic mode, I recently had to renew my passport at the Post Office and was sick on the way home as it caused me so much distress.
I stopped taking the Proxac cold turkey a few weeks ago and didn't have any problems.  I didn't feel and better or any worse.
I have now been prescribed 30mg Mitrazapine - my first tablet will be this evening.  However, I have read bad things about the side affects, I don't want to put on weight or feel any more down and sleepy than I already do.
Are there any positives to this medication - surely there must be!!!!
Advice greatly received.

"I've read many of the posts on this board about the effects of Mirtazapine, and have found it almost impossible to find anyone willing to give it a positive report. Most reports seem full of anxiety, poor sleep, bad dreams, aching joints, lethargy, narcolepsy, weight gain.
I think this drug is as evil in its way as Thalidomide was in its (misused) way. I have come off it, and feel ten years younger, fitter, clearer in mind, happier...whatever. I believe Mirtazapine to be a drug that may ease depression but substitutes horrible symptoms of anxiety etc instead.
I cannot urge you all too strongly to come off this awful anti-depressant and get your GP / trick-cyclist to prescribe something different. My own preference would be either Citalopram or, better, Trazodone, which lifted my severe depression and helped me sleep soundly.
Reading all these posts of fear and worry and hopelessness makes me urge you to take action for yourselves - NOW.
Firm resolve and sensible actions to all.

"HI
Got my self off mirt for a week now, was on 15mg for 4 months, tapered down over about 3 weeks, and felt ok, and better on 7.5 and even half that.
Was really taking it as much to help with sleep ( have always woken up many many times a night for past 30 years, but has got much worse last year or so) as depression, and it did help with my sleep but left me with little motivation to do anything, but now I am having really bad trouble with my sleep, and am tempted to go back to a low dose of mirtazapine to help with this, unless anybody has any good suggestions if alternatives.
As I say always had trouble with sleep for years and have never slept through the night as daft as it sounds, so can't put it just down to coming off mirt, as always had the problem. Depression isn't too bad at all really, but I am now getting depressed and anxious bout not sleeping.....

"I have been taking Mirtazapine for the last 6 months after having had a bad (but short) experience with Citalopram.  For the first 4 and a half months or so was on 15mg and this seemed to be helping initially with the anxiety, although didn't seem to help that much with my get up and go/motivation.  Then it seemed to stop working and at doctors suggestion put it up to 30mg for about 2-3 weeks which didn't seem to help and then up again to 45mg where I've been for the last 2 and a half weeks or so.  It doesn't seem to be working for me, everytime I raise the dose I get a brief 3-4 day period where things get better and then it seems to fall back down again.  
It certainly helps me get to sleep but I'm not convinced it's helping my anxiety just maybe slightly sedating it.  I've also started feeling very down the last few days although wonder if that could just be from the furstration of not feeling better.  I'm tempted to wean myself of them.  I know they take a while to work but have been on 30mg or higher for 4-5 weeks now and can't say I feel any better.  I could cope with the tablets making me feel tired if I didn't have the anxiety as well.
Would be interested in hearing if anyone had a similar experience with Mirtazapine and if they did what did they do and what was the result?
Thanks in advance for any replies

"Hey, I've been on mirt for a good 6months before I began to taper. I started on 30mg, went up to 45mg where I Stayed for the last 3/4months. I decides to come off because I felt the mirt was being counterproductive, I felt quite low and still anxious at times so decided that the worst that could happen would be I'd feel no different if I came off.
I feel like getting a new job and finally a diagonsis for my son with austism to be the really helpful boosts in my mental health. I tapered from 45mg to 30mg for 2 weeks, then 15mg for a week, then 7.5mg for another week and have now stopped. I'm day 4 of no mirtazapine and will admit sleeping has been Harder but not impossible, I have really weird cold symptoms and sneezing all the time, lost my appetite and have some anxiety. The cold and sneezing could possibly be hayfever as mirt has antihistamine effects so could have been masking this.I feel more capable of handling this anxiety and confident its just a mixture of withdrawal and natural anxiety about coming off the medication. I'm interested to hear about others that have withdrawn and had some initial anxiety but came through it again. I felt so good tapering down , like much better than I'd been in months. Its just now 4days off that I feel a bit wobbly.

"So I'vr recently been switchd from Citalopram to Mirtazipine. I took my first pill last night as I knew I didn't have work today. To be fair I had been drinking, but not excessively. Anyways I took it at around 2am and was asleep within 10 minutes. Then today I woke up at 6pm. I slept for 16 hours straight. And all day since then (it's not 11.30pm) I have felt very groggy and drowsy, unable to concentrate much and very tired, despite the excessive sleep I had last night. I'm worried about taking it again tonight as I am working tomorrow. I work as a waiter so obvously drowsiness and fatigue are not very good for that. I'm not working till 5pm alf the pill and take just 7.5?but given that I still feel drowsy now I'm worried this will be the same tomorrow. Can anyone advise me on what I should do? I think that maybe the alcohol contributed to the grogginess today but only somewhat. Is it likely that this will be the same again tomorrow? Should I maybe half the pill and take 7.5 instead?

I can't imagine going through another night like this. I was walking around the house from side to side going crazy. I've never had such problems before, so I'm SURE it's not my anxiety coming back.
Please, any advice will be very helpful. How long does it normally take to for the anxiety/insomnia to start easing up? Does it get gradually better or does it come in waves? Is there something I can use to take the edege off? I have Oxazepam and Clonazapm at home. Will it be ok to take for a few days? Is it likely that I would be a bit better by the time my exams start?

I want to wake up feeling on top of the world and raring to go! 
I do feel like Mirt has helped with my depression but the horrible hangover groggy feeling the next day is unbearable and it makes me feel depressed about it,  I just want to sleep all the time, it lasts all day until I take my next dose.
Does anyone else feel the same on this med? Does this feeling eventually wear off? Because if it doesn't then I'll have to change meds AGAIN as i just can't live like this for much longer!

"Almost 3 weeks ago I stopped Mirtazapine cold turkey. I was on a small dose of 7.5mg but I'm also a small person (8stone) and that dose seemed to work for me. Just before I stopped I tried to taper but then changed my mind and double the dose which almost immidiately gave me some nausea, palpitations and very bad muscles and joints pain. I stayed on that dose for a week but none of the symptoms cleared completely so on Friday 30.05 I stopped it completely. 
Next few days were dreadful, with nausea, palpitations, ringing in the ears (and ear pain), burning sking on legs and arms, painful joints and muscles, especially left leg, muscle twitching, back pain, insomnia. They don't all come in at once and I do have a better moment or day but pretty much i'm still in pain most of the time and exhausted. I'm sure that the fact i've been on an antybiotic (doxycicline) for a bacterial infection drains the body as well and perhaps contributes to feeling ill but my GP says it shouldn't matter. 
Please can anyone having a similar experience reply to this post. My GP just took my hope away today telling me that I don't have any withdrawal as he's never had a problem with this drug, but the only other choice is probably a serious autoimmune disease, which I'm terrified to think of. I never had any muscle or jount pain until about 4 weeks ago and now having a very sad time thinking what happend to my life as I'm not able to look after my family. I just want to have my hope back that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, even if it's a few more weeks or months...

"Hi,
New to the forum so bare with me. Have been being treated for depression for the last 9 months. Still no closer to feeling like my old self, but that's due to a combination of the depression and the constant pain I feel from a herniated L5/S1 disc.
Currently I'm taking 20mg Citalopram, 3600mg Gabapentin, 1000mg Naproxen, 40mg Esomeprozole, 50mg Amitriptyline and the odd Tamazapam at night. My Dr now wants to add 15mg of Mirtazapine into the concoction of medication, but I know very little about it. Having read through some of the other posts on the forum I can see people have mentioned the fact that it makes you very groggy, which really isn't helpful as I already struggle to wake up in the mornings and am consistently late for work, which of course is adding more stress as I'm close to being taken to a disciplinary hearing. My Dr advised me that it would help with my difficulty in getting to sleep and not waking up during the night, but it seems it's just going to add to my issues with waking up.
I've kind of hit a point now where I really don't know what to do, and it just feels like i'm being bombarded with medication until something works. Any advice would be greatly appreciated

"I'll try and keep this brief. I've been depressed for approx 6 years (I'm 21), with varying levels of severity. Recently, for maybe the past 4 months, it's got very bad and completely unmanageable. I've had a bit of counselling in my teens and was seen by a child psychiatrist for a couple of years but never found it to be of much use (my parents arranged it and I guess I was rebelling by not letting it help me... stupid I know).
I've never been on medication before until a few months ago when I was put on Sertraline, but I took 1 tablet and had an awful reaction so was advised not to take any more. After about a week I was put on Citalopram which I was on for 10 days. I did find it lifted my mood but I had no appetite whatsoever and it was drastically affecting my sex life (I still had a high sex drive but was unable to orgasm).
I was then put on Mirtrazapine which I've now been on for almost 5 weeks (4 weeks at 15mg, and 1 week at 30mg). It hasn't taken effect yet; I've read that it can take a while to kick in but I am really reaching my breaking point. I've felt suicidal probably about 5 times since I've been on it, and have been self-harming and drinking heavily (not advised I know but its my only solace).
On 'good days' I just feel numb, but not distressed or panicky or argumentative and I can function near-normally so I class it as a good day. On bad days I feel worthless and angry and despairing and like there's no other way out than suicide. My boyfriend tries hard to help and understand but a lot of the time I take it out on him and can be really vile to him, which distresses me further as he's an amazing man and doesn't deserve it. I have no self esteem, none whatsoever, and this convinces me that he'll cheat or he won't want me anymore, even though he's shown no evidence at all of behaving like this, and in my heart I know he wouldn't. I'm pushing him away with my unfounded paranoia and can see us breaking up over it if I don't sort myself out soon. He's the perfect man for me and it would break me if we were to end.
My family don't know about my depression and I have no friends (not exaggerating or self-pitying, I really don't). I've had 3 counselling sessions from my uni but because the academic year is now over they can't see me til the end of September. I'm on a waiting list for CBT but been told to wait 6-12 months and 'not to hold my breath'.
Sorry, keeping it brief didn't really work out! I guess the things I'm asking are:
1) Any success stories of Mirtrazapine taking effect after the 5 week mark; how long did it take for you etc?, and how did it help? I feel its worth carrying on giving it a go since I've not really had any side effects but extreme tiredness in the mornings, but it sometimes feels completely pointless as it's not 'worked' for me yet and I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle at times.
2) Any self-help methods that you've found to help you when you've been at your lowest? I have a diary app on my phone where I write at least 1 positive thing that has happened each day, and have done this since 1st January this year. It occasionally helps to read through this or texts from my boyfriend but not always. I also have a mindfulness app which I sometimes use but I guess I've not really got into it. I intend to join some sort of group/hobby in order to keep myself busy and make new friends but I'm sure people in the same boat as me can appreciate that when you're in the depths of depression you really can't take that leap of faith to actually go ahead and DO something about it.
Sorry for the long post! Any advice much appreciated.

Has any1 ever taken both? I will be going back to my GP to discuss but wanted to find out if any1 has any other suggestions. HELP!

"Hi there.
I was taking mirtazapine for a couple of months, last December and January. I decided to go off it -- I was down to 1/2 of a 30 mg tab and just stopped taking it around the end of January. Big mistake, I guess.
For the past six weeks or so, I have been having extreme anxiety and panic attacks, cold sweats, shaky hands and nausea, mild paranoia and mild agoraphobia.
I didn't put two and two together until today -- must be mirt withdrawal.
I am wondering how much longer this might last?
Every day is a huge challenge.
Fortunately (or not) I am retired, so not busy during the daytime, although it helps if there are people around.
Any advice/support/sympathy will be most welcome.

"After all the bad reviews on here regarding Mirt I was scared to death of taking it.
I have really bad anxiety, wake up panicky and anxious every day etc...I couldn't go out!. I am now on my 7th tablet of 15mg Mirt.
When I took my first tablet, the next day I was really spaced out, slept nearly all day, felt woozy, the day after i was nausious and had diarreah but that could have been anything, slept nearly all day again. I felt tired and spaced out for a few days. But now, Im MUCH better, I do not wake up anxious, I just get up and get on with the day, I am not panicky, still a bit tired but I can handle that, I even went for a short walk which I have been struggling to do.
I just wanted to let people know that are wary or scared that yes, first few days you may get a few side effects but STICK with it...they do disappear after a time and it does get better, Ive only been on them a week and waiting for them to really kick in, but feel already that they are having an effect.
The only downside is that I can't stop eating....I am constantly thinking about food!!
Just stick it out for a few weeks and give this drug a chance....I have, and Im going to stick it out. By the way, this is the first time I have taken antidepressants!

"Switching from fluoxetine to mirtazapine – Have been taking prescribed antidepressants for about 6 years. First venlafaxine, then citalopram, then fluoxetine. For me, all of these were effective – especially fluoxetine – but all had more or less undesirable side-effects. After about 2 years on fluoxetine, these included: excessive sweating (eventually almost constant); breathlessness on exertion (increasingly); fatigue and drowsiness; and sexual dysfunction. Having come off antidepressants at various times, I know that I don’t cope well without them so I asked GP about an alternative to SSRIs – hence mirtazapine. Over past 2 weeks been weaning off fluoxetine and onto mirtazapine. Effects obviously arise from both those events and thus far only taking a half-dose (15 mg) of mirtazapine (30mg as of tomorrow). However:
:D Sweating has stopped - hooray!

A lot of this is withdrawal from the fluoxetine. There is also a tendency to ascribe everything to depression and/or antidepressants, whereas there are always other things going on as well. Going to see how the mirtazapine pans out after a few weeks, then reassess.

"I have been on Mirt for about 5 weeks now.
I started on 30mg but the side effects are horrendous for me - it started with just a few aches, that gradually got worse by the day until every muscle in my body hurt (even my fingers and toes) and had put on almost a stone in weight. After 3wks on 30mg I had a follow up appointment with the Doctor, after mentioning all the problems I was having, he decreased my dose to 15mg and said a reduced dose would help with the side effects - it did for a few days, but the past week all of the above side effects have returned and are again getting worse each day.
I am going to stop taking them. Yes - I do feel I need something for my low moods - but my Doctor was reluctant to change the medication and the side effects are making me feel terrible physically.
So without the lectures of 'go back to your dr' etc etc, I am after some advice on how to stop taking this medication? Do I just stop? Do I lower my dose again, or take the dose every other day and over how long a time period?

"Hi out there!
Is any body having loose or aching joints or having difficulty swollowing/swollen throat?
Soon after starting Mirt 9 weeks ago I began to have an aching throat which developed into problems with swollowing, this has stayed with me. Also my left knee joint has become very loose and now 'clicks' a lot when I first start to walk, my lower back also aches and also my skin is quite sensitive. I was also used to walking 4k each morning and now am exhausted at 2k.
I have been on 30mg for 8.5 wks prescribed for my deep depression from work and an operation I had last December. The Mirt has helped the depression but not a great deal, becuase the side effects I get keep me from relaxing on the med. Has anybody else experienced these side effects?

"Hi All,
I started Mirtaz about 6.5 weeks ago.
My starting dose was 15mg for 8 days, then 30mg for 13 days and then 45mg for 16 days.
The 45mg was to much, felt really agro all the time and very irritable, so the doc dropped my dose back to 30mg which I have now been on for 11 days, but I am finding I am needing to take 1 to 2 Lorazepam a day because my anxiety and intrusive thoughts have come back and meditation/mindfulness isn't helping me as much as it was.
I wake up with a stiff sore neck every morning now and have thoughts of wanting to crack my neck but never do cause I don't want to harm myself and never have.
Does anyone think things will get better or do I need to get my doc to try me on a dose like 37.5mg to see if that helps the anxiety and intrusive thoughts to lesson ?
I would be very grateful for any advice that anyone could give me.
Kind Regards,

I used to be on Venlafaxine and alcohol was never a problem. I am not an alcoholic but when on holiday I do like a few drinks. I know some people on the Forum have had bad experiences with alcohol while on Mirtazapine but I just wondered if that was the norm for everyone. I was hoping not to have to increase the dose yet again and if alcohol is the problem I will certainly give it up. In fact starting today I have stopped. I have an appointment with my GP on Wednesday so I am hoping that my not drinking I may feel good again.

"I'm now two weeks into taking a 15mg dose of Mirtazapine. This was prescribed for anxiety/poor sleep. Back in 2009 I did take Citalopran, but nothing since then.
My first impressions:
Sleep
I don't have any caffeine after mid-afternoon, I take my tablet just before bedtime. I can't say that it has improved my sleep pattern at all. I now seem to get about three hours of sleep very soon after taking it but then it's broken sleep for the rest of the night, waking regularly every hour or so.
Anxiety
I think I'm a little less anxious but how much of that is down to the Mirtazapine and how much to external factors I don't know.
Side effects
Digestion : I'm feeling fairly bloated and constipated which is pretty unpleasant.
Conclusion:
All in all I don't really think Mirtazapine is right for me.

Just on 4th day if 15mg of mirt and I am finding that I am having problems with getting to sleep ( which were there before, one of reasons why gp put me on this, along with depression) and I was under impression would help with sleep, plus, more strangely I guess, I can't stop wanting to pee.
Anyone else had problems like this? And if so, will they go away in a week or do, or am I stuck with the side effects

"Hi
I am on day 10 of taking Mirtazapine 30mg, a couple of times yesterday I came across feeling funny - difficult to describe - kind of spaced out, not exactly light headed but a brief feeling im going to pass out that lasted a matter of seconds. Today I have had the same happening to me but they are more frequent and lasting much longer - upto 10 minutes, but as I sit and type this it has been about 20 minutes so far this time, I'm not shaking but feel like I am - is this normal, its actually scaring me a bit??
I am taking them 1hr before going to bed - around 9:30ish

"I've been on mirtazapine 30mg for 9weeks now with overall positive improvement on my anxiety and mild depression. I'm being treated mainly for generalised anxiety disorder as a result of insomnia. My sleep is fab now, but unfortunately my generalised anxiety stuck with me. I'm still not feeling 100% me, I still feel quite uneasy and uncomfortable at times and so have been prescribed 45mg, haven't started taking yet as a bit warey...keep hoping that the 30mg will start to work permantly but I've had a rubbish day today and just wondered if people found an improvement in anxiety when increasing to 45mg.

I'm not expecting to wake up tomorrow and it be fine, but just curious as to how long you should leave it before deciding it's not for you. Do you have to give it about a month like when you first start on tablets? Thanks in advance.

"Hi all
I have been prescribed these by my doctor after many years of not sleeping well and quite bad depression off and on for a number of years as well. Some days not too bad, others, well not good at all.
I am very anti drugs, and have tried some before but HATE the side effects and know I am going to get them and I am quite scared bout taking anything, but lack of sleep is getting worse and worse and consequently depression also.
Had to pack in my job, and have become a bit of a reclusive, although some days I can cope if sleep has not been too bad, and have heard these might help in that respect. I am not expecting miracles, but any improvement I can get would be help as I am in a bad place really. Also worried that I may get worse on these and scared as to what I might be like then.
Any advice would be great thanks

"I have some questions about the different doses of mirtazapine, any experience and advice will be greatly helpful.
I am currently taking 30mg of mirtazapine, have been doing so since the beginning of january so about two months now. I have felt that overall it is helping me, I feel much more relaxed, much more inclined to get out and about and do something with my day, and dare I say it 'happier'.
Once a month a see a nurse from the cmht, we discuss how I am getting on with my medication and any problems I might be having. The only problem I am still having with mirtazapine is the tiredness I feel during the day. If I do pop out for the day, to see a friend or just to do a bit of shopping when I come home I am exhausted, which then puts me off wanting to things. Also I sleep around 12 or more hours almost every night. At first it was great that I was able to sleep so much after not sleeping for so long, but now that I am feeling better in myself and want to get back to leading a normal life the tiredness is holding me back.
I had discussed the tiredness with my GP about a month ago and she said that it would improve with time as my body is still getting used to the drug. Last week I had my appointment with the nurse from cmht, I discussed it with her also and she said it might help to reduce my dose so that I am not feeling so tired, but said I would have to make an appointment with my GP again to do this.
So my worries are that a lower dose might not be enough to keep away the depression and anxiety. I don't know whether I am best to just stick at this dose and put up with the tiredness, or reduce my dose and possibly risk the depression and anxiety returning.
Does anyone have experience of a change of dosage of mirtazapine? Relating to tiredness and whether it was a high enough dose to keep depression and anxiety away?
Thanks for any replies.

"Hi everyone,
Been on 15mg Mirtazapine about a month now, and I've had some really vivid, weird dreams on them (washing Dobby from Harry Potter in the bath?!) very creepy, scary dreams at times. I know this is quite a common side effect, but the main one I am concerned about is bedwetting.
Since taking them, about a fortnight ago, I've started to wet the bed. I dream I'm on the toilet, and before I know it, I've wet the bed. Its extremely embarrassing as I'm 24 years old not 4. I am going to call my GP tomorrow, but has anyone else experienced this?
I am sleeping a lot better, and the Mirtazapine are helping me in terms of my depression and eating habits, but the bedwetting is becoming an issue. Its really frustrating.

"I have had severe anxiety for 30+ years. I have a dread of not being able to sleep and after several nights of not sleeping I visited my GP who prescribed Mirtazapine as they have a sedative. I am feeling extremely anxious. confused and finding it very difficult to concentrate. Does this eventually wear off? I have tried several anti depressants in the past and recently (about a year ago) started to take citalopram as the Doctor thought they were better for treating anxiety. I have felt well for 12 months but suddenly the fear re-appeared. I was then prescribed the Mirtazapine which I find send me to sleep but I feel so ""groggy"". Is there anyone who has experienced these side effects and do they eventually dissipate. I dont know if I can continue with this medication if the side effects continue but I really need to sleep. Would appreciate any feed back. A friend of mine takes 30 mg of this drug and seems to feel O.K. She has been taking it fo 2 years. I am only on 15 mg and feel totally out of control.

"Hello everyone;
I'm happy to have found this forum! My story is similar to to what remeron(mirtz) can do,even in a short period of use.
I was put on mirtz for sleep after discontinuing 5 years use of eszopiclone (lunesta). Lunesta is a benzo in
sheep clothing. The mirtz did help me sleep until the 5th week it was causeing adverse reaction after dosing.
It began to cause anxiety and increase heart rate after dosing. My time on mirtz was 5 weeks at a low dose of 4mg.
My last dose was on feb 8. Today makes 12days off. Three days ago feb18th is when I got slammed,
symptoms, chills,anxiety, deppresion, feeling like I can cry for any reason, headache, nausea,tinnitus,higher than norm blood pressure, sleeplessness & no appetite. I thought since I was only on 4 mg and 5 weeks of
use that I would not feel it. I know what benzo WD is and this is not it.
I truly would appreciate some of your experienes coming off and knowing everyone is different a ballpark on how long will I be dealing with this hell? Also since I'm I the begining stages of WD dose the clock begin when you get your first symtoms? And if there's any thing that has helped while going through this ?
Thank you all

Then the third night it took about 5 hours to get to sleep and I had very broken sleep. Last night was the fourth night and I slept about 7 hours taking 3 hours to get to sleep.
I have woken up with a very dry mouth which I expected and I'm very awake and extremely irritable! I don't feel I've slept at all either.
Has anybody else had this? I thought these were supposed to be knock out pills?
Citalopram wasn't working for me...made me worse and doctor thought these would be better.
I know its early days but I'm dubious about continuing. I'm especially worried about weight gain as I already have 5 stone to loose which is part of the reason I'm depressed.

For as long as I can remember I have suffered with depression and anxiety.
(Didn't realise I had severe anxiety until about 2 weeks ago) . Had a really bad depressive episode about 3-4 weeks ago and was convincing myself I had serious mental illnesses. Any way this got really bad and I saw a doctor who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. As I wasn't sleeping (5 nights I was prescribed mirtazapine. I have been on 15mg for 16 nights and already I feel so much better, calmer and am able to sleep. My depression is also a lot better. I have had no noticeable side effects from the meds apart from weight gain. A whole stone in 16 days..
I really feel down and extremely anxious about this part as I like being slim. Anyways I am considering swapping mirtazapine to citalopram. But don't know the best way to go about it and also have heard some bad thing about cit. I am worried about not being able to sleep without the mirt.
Please help me as I don't know what to do. I really don't want to put on weight. As I am 100 percent sure this will increase my depression which will then increase my anxiety.
Please send me some advice. Thanks xx

However I went on to 15mg of Mirt from 40g prozac after my doctor recommeded it for my bad sleeping patterns and lack of being able 2 fall asleep and was still having really bad weeks. I suffer really bad where sometimes I can`t even find myself getting out of bed or speaking to anyone. Since I have been on these I haven`t had a bad day, but Im always so sedated and like a zombie and I`ve put on a stone and a half in those 3 weeks. Plus I have really bad nightmares and have been falling asleep at work where I`ve been half asleep/half awake and thinking really weird things and also had some sleep paralysis, which is awful. I am trying to outweigh the cons and pros, but I really do not want to put on any more weight in such a short time.

"Hi All
Just thought I would tell you about my experience so far.
I have been motivated by some of your experiences on here and thought I would try mirtazapine after much time convincing myself that I was better off without medication.
I am about a week on since I started it, so I can't say much so far...
To sum it up, many of the people on here, like me, didn't want to take mirtazapine because of some of the side effects that I had heard others experience...For me, I have experienced little side effects.
I have had no life threatening side effects.
The only side effects I have noticed really is drowsiness about an hour after taking the dose (15mg) which feels a bit like you are 'spaced out' but by just lying down in bed makes this feeling okay.
Maybe sometimes feeling restless when trying to get to sleep, and waking up a few times after bizarre dreams...
Also increased appetite for sugary foods, although this could be controlled by simply eating fruit.

"ive just started mt but i am regretting it reading all this information. what am i getting my self in for ive only been 15mg for 2 days and i want to come off already. do you think i will be ok if i do?
ive been suffering from aniexty thats why io was percribed it but ive felt worse these 2 days on them than in along time. i was told i should feel worse before i feel better and it takes about a week. but this doesn't make sense to me. surely once youve lasted a week your system is used to it but now you can't come off your stuck!! and if it made me feel like crap first but now i feel better how can you tell if its really made a differance if i wasn't to bad before? i had aniexty but everybody gets that don't they? i get headaches and the doctors keep saying its depression. i mean i do worry alot and that causes headaches but worryings in my family were always worriers no drug can cure that only me. surely theres anotherway? im going to try and come offf the mitazapine it doesn't seem worth it reading thses reveiws seems to make things worse.

Has anyone else experienced this. I am off work with stree at the moment so I do have the time to sleep. I am just worried that when I do go back to work i won't be able to get out of bed in the morning. Any advice or comments welsome.

"Have been on 15 mg mirt for a week. GP prescribed it for my insomnia. First night slept for 12 hours straight through. But the sedative effects seem to be wearing off. Last night slept for 3 hours before waking up and not being able to go back to sleep for yonks, and by then it was nearly time to get up for work.
Am wondering whether I need a higher dose, but I've read that the higher doses are for people genuinely suffering from depression. The only depression I have is from worrying about not being able to sleep. I thought mirt was the answer, but now am not so sure.
Any people with experience on this?

"I am on 45mg of Mirtazapine. I had quite a lot to drink on Saturday night and I know the info on the leaflet says avoid alcohol. I had a terrible day today with really low self esteem and suicidal thoughts. Has anyone else had similar experiences. I guess the answer is not to drink alcohol whilst on this medication.

"I am currently withdrawing from mirtazapine 15mg, I have been taking half a tablet 7.5mg for 2 weeks, Unsure now whether to take 7.5mg every other night for 2 weeks or 2.5mg every night for 2 weeks and hopefully be off all together then.

"So far so good. I noticed my appetite has decreased a whole lot, which I'm happy about, because I've piled on the pounds since I've been on this medication. I'll keep you updated on any symptoms I get when they occur. And yes, I know you're not supposed to go off antidepressants cold turkey but I don't really have a choice. My prescription was about to run out and I'm out the country.
Luckily, I'm feeling a lot better now so I should be back to my old 'un-depressed' self in four weeks (I think that's how long the meds take to leave your body).

"So first of all i want to say how grateful i am for finding this website as i believe everybody can get good advice from here.
First things first. Ive heard a lot of bad things about mirtazapine on here but my experience has been good. Ive been on 60mg citalopram which did not do anything for me. I was fluoxitine (prozac) and had a horrible experience with it however I have heard great things about these drugs working for other people so i believe that every drug has a different affect on everyone.
I am on 45mg Mirtazapine. I started taking 15mg around 7 weeks ago and was increased to 30mg 2 weeks later and then 45mg two weeks after that. My problems are severe depression and major anxiety. No emotions, afraid to go outdoors, suicidal thoughts (which I didnt want to be there) and losing touch with reality. The first four weeks were bad. Side affects were horrible but the main thing this drug did was make me sleep which had been a major problem for me. After getting the worse out the way I started to feel more relaxed. This feeling was overpowering and I could tell the drug was working. Then my mood lifted out of nowhere and I genuinly cried because of how happy I felt. The initial \""happy factor\"" has gone down slightly however I am now socialising again and have been referred to a psychiatrist. Things are looking up.
I just hope there are other people who have finally found the right medication for them.
Adios Amigos.

"Hi,
I was precribed 15mg Mirtazapine as a \""step up\"" from the 40mg Fluoxetine I had been taking for about 3 years, following a very bad breakdown. Previous to that I have been on lower doesages of Fluoxetine and other SSRIs sinc eI was about 18 of and on (I'm 29 now).
I have been taking Mirtazapine for about 2-3 months now and initially I was feeling better but now I feel worse than ever before. Intensely depressed and can't stop crying. I'm also sleeping 15-18 hours a day at weekends whenever possible.
I can't get a doctors appointment for another few weeks but I can't go on like this any more. Shall I just up my dosage to 30mg until I see the doctor since I'm pretty sure that's what he'll do anyway? I really want someone to take responsibility for medicating me properly but no one seems to want to do that at my doctors.
Also, does anyone know if an NHS walk-in centre will give me a new prescription for a different dosage since they're much easier for me to see?

"Having read some of the experiences others have had withdrawing from Mirtazapine I thought I would post my own. I hope it may be of use to others. I recently was re-prescribed Mitazapine,after three years of not taking it. I took one 15mg tablet, felt like I'd been hit over the head with a riot shield and fell out of bed with severe restless legs syndrome. I decided there and then \""there is no way I am going through all this again\"", and stopped it right there.
Previously, I had been prescribed Mirtazipine for severe anxiety and depression. This medication caused restless leg syndrome, and caused me to put on 3 stones in weight. Despite being previously a fit and active person. I became lethargic, and fatigued easily, needing to rest after evey 20 minutes of moderate activity, not to mention the dreadfull hangovers I would have all morning. I persisted in taking it for nearly 5 years because I looked forward to the sedative effect it has. I even looked foward to it at night, despite the dreadful side effects, because I felt it helped me escape the world into sleep. Personaly I think Mirtazipine is addictive and I was addicted.
I eventualy decided enough was enough and decided to get my life back.
My GP was of little use when it came to advice for tapered withdrawal, though damn quick to prescibe the stuff in the first place. I detemined an action plan of my own. I was aware of the unpleasent withdrawal symptoms of suddenly stopping, as I had previously, on occaision, run out of money and couldn't afford my prescription. Dizziness, exteme anxiety, nausia, insomnia, sweating and flu like muscle and head aches are all in store for any one who stops this medication abruptly. I tapered Mirtazipine over aproximately 3 months by, cutting up 30mg tablets. 1st week I took 3/4rs of a tablet, then 1/2 plus an 1/8th second week, then 1/2 plus 1/16th for the 3rd week and so on. Eventually I was taking 1/16th of 30mg (or less) per night for the last 2 weeks after which I felt no withdrawal syptoms upon cessation. The doses are aproximate as cutting these tablets is accurately is difficult.
All of this took a lot of focus and bloody-minded determination. I find it surprising that the manufacturers don't provide decreasing doses for people wishing to stop taking their product without discomfort. At the moment I have decided to cope with life without Mirtazapine, or any other chemical horror. It can be very difficult at times, but vastly better than being a Drs. corporate guinea pig/junkie. I would say though, that for people who are severly depressed, Mirtazapine or other medications could be helpful if used for the short term, but please be aware of the very real side effects and problems with these substances. Ask yourself very carefully if you think you need this, despite what your Dr. may say. These drugs should be a last resort, not first port of call. They most certainly are no magic cure, and have serious \""side effects\"" that should not be underestimated.

In particular the death of my partner 7 years ago, I can't remember the exact date. I know I used to be able to recall the date but now I can only remember the month and year.

Been on Citalopram 60mg and have been asked to swap to Mirt 30mg.
I have insomnia already, suffered since the age of 12 from depression and anxiety. I've been awake now for 3 days, and went to the docs this morning. I can't use zopiclone anymore as they wont prescribe that for me anymore. (i'm now 45)
Doc said that I can swap straight to mirt from citalopram, and he's a pharmaceutical expert (no all docs are, they just know what to prescribe).
I'm going to trust him and start taking the mirt tonight, and sod the horror stories that are written on this site.
I will report back on how I get on, as the lack of libido and appetite on citalopram is doing my head in. (and my partner is getting mighty frustrated with the lack of sex)
I don't care about weight gain, as I need to put on weight, and I want my libido and a healthy appetite back.

"Since my last post, I have successfully cut down from 7.5mg a night to 7.3 one night, 3.75mg the next and am now on 3.75mg a night (a quarter of a tablet). So far, so good. I made the best decision when I stopped listening to advice and listened to my body instead. If a cut back didn't feel right, I adjusted and took a half or a quarter tablet when it suited me. I was only on 1 15mg tablet to start with, took half a tablet every night for 2 months, then swapped to half/quarter alternae nights for 1 month and have now been taking a quarter for 2 weeks. I have also been to see a herbalist and have had a tincture custom made to suit my needs. It tastes like Georges Marvellous Medicine must have done but I will see if it helps. I am able to run in along side my mirtazapine on Drs agreement and have been taking it for 5 days. have also been doing CBT for Insomnia using Overcoming Insomnia and Sleep Problems book by Colin A Espie and have now had 2 weeks worth of decent sleep averaging 5 hours 45 mins a night in the first week and 8 hours a night in the 2nd week. It would appear there are so many horror stories about Mirtazapine withdrawel that I wanted to offer some contrary experiences. So far, I have only had one blip cuting down, when I jumped form half a tablet to a quarter over night.... I had a tearful wek so went back to half/quarter alternating and, touch wood, have been fine too. I have also been exercising more and have lost 3lbs in the last week. My appetite is still healthy but the feeling of being full has returned!! I didn't have this whilst on a higher dose and just constantly ate but now I can feel when to stop eating again and my food intake has decreased a lot!! I am still 30lbs heavier than when I started but I am hopeful diet, exercise and better self organisation with meals will help. A light is at the end of the tunnel!!
Hope you are all well

"Wow you have had a very extreme reaction, I've never heard of citalopram doing that before. However it does do some strange things so perhaps it has just exaggerated what you were already feeling? I started on citalopram too and have to say it was the worst drug I have ever experienced. Massively increased anxiety, dry mouth, sickness, shaking, mania I even rang NHS direct as I was so bad on it. It took a good few days to get out of my system after I stopped taking it.
I am now on lithium and mirtazapine. The mirtazapine has been great for me, it's really helped with my sleeping too. No dry mouth and I think it's helped with anxiety too.
Hope it works for you and you start feeling more yourself.
take care

"Hi. I have suffered with Depression for 6 years now, and have tried Fluxetine (which worked for a small time), Citalopram/Venlafaxine/Sertraline (Which didn't work at all!) Then I was started on Mirtazapine 15mg, then 30mg, then 45mg. And it really did work! I felt really great, could sleep easily, I put on a lot of weight but I needed to anyway! I've took it for two years, and told my Psychiatrist I wanted to stop taking it, and see how I would cope without it. Because I'm sick of Anti-Depressants now, and am worried about the long term effect on my brain and body. But she disagreed, and said maybe one more year. I was pissed off! So I started taking one every other day, then one every three days, for a Month, then none! Within three days of stopping I had an Anxiety attack, and my initial depression came back gradually more and more to the point where I had to go back to the surgery and on Monday she started me back on 45MG of Mirtazapine. Is this too high a dose to start with,?

I went up to 30mg a night a one point, i am really happy I have been able to cut down to 3.75 a night now (quarter of 15mg tab). I am very wary of cutting down any further, I may start taking a quarter every other night. A friend of mine had to cut it down to a crumb a night for ages before she felt ready to come off. The one thing I will not do is rush because no way do I want the terrible withdrawals again! And, never again will I take Mertazipine!!

I am 41 and am at the end of my tether. My body seems to be breaking under the pressure-having terrible gum problems.

"Hi All, I've recently been trying to cut down on mirtazapine as I am now 10 weeks pregnant and have been advised to do so by my GP. I went from 45mgs to 30mgs with no problems but felt horrendous when I went from 30 to 15 alternate days (at around 7 weeks). I felt nauseated - I couldn't even look at food, never mind eat it. Going back to 30 mgs for a week got rid of that feeling completely. I'm now using a liquid solution to cut down by 1.5mgs every few days but am feeling really ill. I have cold sweats, hot sweats and nausea and this gets worse between 5 and 10pm. I tend to take my mirtazapine at 10pm and within half an hour I'm OK. No-one seems to take me seriously when I say it's the mirtazapine and not the pregnancy that's making me feel like this. Does anyone have any thoughts on this or tips on how to get though it?

"Hi there,
Im on 15mg Mirt and 600mg Seroquel. Have only been on the Mirt for 5 days, came off of 60mg Duloxetine. Withdrawal from that has been and still is HELL.
Just wondered if its normal to feel like a 90 year old suffering from arthritis on the Mirt?? Every bone in my body aches to the point that I cannot get off of the sofa or out of bed and Im walking around hunched over like a little old lady. All I need now is a zimmer frame and the faint smell of lavender!
I Know Im joking about it, but its really getting me down. I have been on this med roundabout for over a year now. Gone through 8 anti deps, 3 anti psych and 2 relaxants. Nothing seems to work, and the withdrawal everytime I switch to a new one is awful. Trying to get outsiders to understand is impossible, and Im at my wits end!
Have been off work for a year and have absolutley nothing to do with my day. This topped with the aches, tiredness, dizzyness and overall depression which started me on this rollercoaster in the bloody first place!!!!
Can anyone say anything positive or uplifting to me please. I dont knoe where else to turn. Im thinking of coming off everything altogether, going back to work and just muddling through. Exept, I have been there and done that, thats when I was diagnosed!!!!!!!
Help me, please. Or I'll have to start going to my local luncheon club and taking coach trips.
Im 25 by the way. LOL :cry:

"on 30mg mirtazipine and had swollen lymph glands, face swollen on right side, sore throat and earache. next came pain along jaw, was sent to out patients twice for observation, put on opiate tramadol, went to dentist after four days of intense pain and begged him to take a tooth out, he said nothing wrong with tooth and that judging by my appearance my immune system was shot to hell, i made him remove tooth and he showed me my healthy tooth afterwards. in total i must have seen at least 6 doctors told them all about my medication and not one of them picked up the link to mirtazapine, two weeks after i read the fine print and it states the drug has caused problems with a temporary loss of white blood cells . now my under arm lymph area is sore i hope it is nothing serious but i am worried. take care if you are on this drug.

"This is day 6 for me, on a 15 mg dose. Although I sleep well at night, after waking at 8-ish I don't feel like getting out of bed. I stay in bed until mid-day, still half asleep. I still feel sleepy after getting-up, but this decreases as the day progresses.
I read that \""somnolence\"" is a common side effect, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as this. If I weren't retired, with a supportive wife, I think I would have given up on Mirt by now. How does this compare with your experience on starting, and how long was it before things improved?
On the positive side, I haven't had any other troublesome side effects.
Good wishes to all.

"I have a history of addiction and anxiety and was on citalopram a few years ago. I had a nightmare time coming off citalopram and hoped I would never need to go on medication again. However, I was paid off from my job in May and had, what I realise now, a mid life crisis. I just felt myself sinking into a pit of hopelessness.
I went to see my doctor and the options were psychology or meds. I've been down the NHS psychology route and couldn't face it again, so I reluctantly agreed to go on meds, but stressed I didn't want citalopram again as coming off of them was terrifying.
I was put on mirtazapine which were supposed to be easier to withdraw from. Well, I took them for 3 months and they were a wonderful antidepressant, but I built up a tolerance to them very quickly and put on 2 stones. I got to the stage where I was going to have to up them to 45mg and I had to way up the consequences. I didn't want to put on more weight and build up more tolerance.
I decided that I had dealt with the mid life stuff, so I would come off meds and make a new start. I hate missing out on sleep, so I came off them gradually and 4 weeks ago stopped them altogether. I haven't slept all weekend and have been having attacks of intense rage. My eyes were popping out of my head at one stage and I was afraid of feeling like that.
The upshot is, coming off these is hell also. They say these pills are non addictive, who are they trying to kid. Granted, they got me through hell, but there is a heavey price to pay. I hope to god this is the last time I need to go through this.

I am still having suicuidal thoughts and the nightmares are so disturbing that they make me more depressed.

"it seems there are several posts here mention anxiety and that it can be worse on Mirtazapine.
my opinion is that the root cause of anxiety comes from feelings deep in the unconscious part of the psyche, particularly anger and rage that get repressed by the conscious mind, because they're incompatible with how the conscious mind wants to live life. In my case (2 1/2 years of Repetitive Strain Injury) I believe that instead of anxiety being a symptom, my brain started the process of creating physical symptoms - what is termed a mindbody equivalent ( using the term \""mindbody\"" to emphasise the innate relationship between the two, something that modern medicine has huge problems with)
I found I only started to get physically better recently using analytical self-psychology (NOT CBT) after Dr. Sarno (see Google) BUT mentally, I turned into an emotional basket case, flipped out, and that's why I have been on Mirtazapine and now trying to withdraw. problem is, it was having such a sedating effect, the physical symptoms seemed to be there more in the mornings and I was starting to get anxious as well.
I am wondering whether anyone else feels that Mirtazapine has the effect of blocking the unconscious mind even more, therefore causing more anxiety. (Think there would have to be caveats around the effects of different dosages, and we know. It affects everyone different anyway) Anyone care to comment on this theory?

"Hello,
I have been on Mirtazapine for some months now - I take it in conjunction with Venlafaxine. I started on 15 mg, moved up to 30, then back down to 15. I almost feel at my wits' end. I suffer with severe and chronic depression, and also from generalised anxiety and stress - not only do I have Churchill's 'Black Dog,' but I also have a Black Cat and a Black Budgie as well.
Add into this mix a rotten case of fibromyalgia and I.B.S., and you can guess that I feel pretty dreadful any day of the week.
I'm pretty limited in terms of mobility. I have to use a stick most of the time, and now and again have to rely on a wheelchair. Quite a lot of the time, actually. Therefore, to cut a long story short, I get no exercise. None at all.
As I mentioned, I have been on Mirtazapine for a few months, prescribed to assist the Venlafaxine, on which I have been for over 5 years, and was up to 225 mg per day. But sleep was an issue - I rarely get 3 consecutive hours a night. Bear also in mind that I am over 16 1/2 stone; which, trust me, when you're only 5'7\"", that's overweight. I thought I was in the queue marked \""handsome devil,\"" but seem to have ended up in the one marked \""shortarse\"" instead. Anyway, my stomach is bloated out and my wife is forever trying to find foods that do not bloat me, but we are running out of options.
I seem to have every symptom in the book: general pain (this is part-fibromyalgia, part medication) all over my body, overweight, tired, mood swings, shaking of arms and legs, twitching hands, acid reflux (very bad at night just as I am going off to sleep - it jerks me awake), fast heartbeat, sweating, swollen hands and fingers. And that's just the physical symptoms. Mentally, I'm a mess of panics, depression, moods affected by the weather, feelings of hopelessneess and of impending death. All of this leads to some pretty bad days.
Add to this in the last 48 hours my feet and lower legs have swollen up beyond all recognition - could this be a Mirtazapine symptom? It could be due to lack of exercise but it just seems odd that the problem has sprung up in the last day or so. I shuffle around the house feeling like I'm about to die, which would be a shame, because House is on tomorrow.
But in all seriousness I feel hopeless, lost, like every symptom is piling on top of another - no relief and no prospect of getting any better. In addition to the 'Mirt' and the 'Ven', I'm also on the highest possible doses of Pregabalin, Codeine for the pain as well as paracetamol plus, oh yes and Bisoprolol for the anxiety. I also have diarrhoea pretty regularly and feel sick at night, especially when trying to go to sleep.
My wife is extraordinarily tolerant of the way that I am, but I sometimes wonder how much more of it my body can take. Sorry that not all of this is Mirtazapine related - my initial question was whether anyone thought the Mirtazapine could be causing the swollen feet. They are very painful now, more so than usual, because my skin is being stretched tight across the tops of my feet. This is in addition to the bone-ache I feel constantly inside my feet anyway.
I feel like a lost cause. With painful feet.
Cheers
Stephen

"Hi
I have been on Mirtazapine now for about 6 months, I was on 15mg for 3 months then my doc upped it to 30mg, I went through a VERY bad patch one day and felt that ill my wife called the doctor out, anyway he gave me some valium to calm me down as I was in a right state, and increased the Mirtazapine to 45mg. I felt bloody terrible after the increase to 45mg, I was sort of spaced out all the time so I reduced it myself back to 30mg. Thing is, although it seems to be helping with the depression I don't feel like doing anything, by that I mean absolutely nothing, I just sit in the kitchen staring out of the window all day, I have no motivation at all, Its as if the depression is still there but I dont feel depressed, its very difficult to explain really. I just feel useless. I feel tired all the time, and sort of \""out of touch with reality\"" Has anyone else experienced this with Mirtazapine?
I'm going up to see my doc on Tuesday as I want to come off this mirtazapine as its doing my head in.
any suggestions greatly appreciated.

The time has come and I am on day 2 of withdrawing from 45mg to 30mg. Have read others postings and am grateful for advice given.Thanks.
I made the decision last week to come off the Mirt, couldn't face the aches and pains and weight gain any more.That is a shame because there were some very good effects too. My Gp has agreed to take me off them and under guidance of the psych will start on Duloxetine after two weeks. Gp suggested 30mg Mirt at night for a week, then 15mg for a week to coincide with introducing the Duloxetene at 20mg to start with. There are good and bad write ups for Duloxotine and as I am prone to nausea that will be an unwanted effect,Hope I last the course.Back at hosp appt 21st July.
I know it wont be easy and I may break the weaning off doseage to a lesser amount. Will need everyone's help on this page. Good luck to anyone else at the same stage.

I want to be off it due to the side effects although the antid side of it is working. I need something that is good for Anxiety, does not make you feel sick and gives a good sleep pattern. Am going back to my gp but do not want to be fobbed off with any old thing. Can't take Prozac or similar. I know its a tall order but I would value your support out there.

I've been on ADs for a good few years now but more recently (around 4 months ago) my GP suggested I change meds over to Mirtazapine. Since then I have gained over 2st in weight. My appetite is all over the place and I crave carbs like you wouldn't believe. I'm fairly fit, 6' 3\"", I walk around 14 miles a week, cycle (mountain bike) a good 15 hard miles but this weight gain is really getting me down. Been back to the GP who says that, basically, it's \""par for the course\"".

"I was wondering if other people taking Mirt are in the same position as me. I am taking 15mg nightly and only been taking for 8 nights. However, I do know that it takes 2-4 weeks before you feel better but are you meant to feel worse first?
I have been diagnosed stress from my Dr and this is the first time in my life this has happened so not even sure his diagnosis is right. I say this as there is no reason for me to be stressed except work has been harder mentally than normal.
Since taking Mirt I struggle to function at all. I am sleeping better but do have enormous amount of dreams so not sure if I am getting any rest. However, before Mirt I was only sleeping 3-4 hours then wide awake for rest of night. But now after better night sleep I feel like a 'zombie' for want of a better word. I cannot work at the moment although my bosses are being very supportive. Have other people experienced feeling worse before better?

"Hi there,
I was on a high dose of Prothiaden for a number of years and the dreams were no longer significant, which was great after bad dreams since I was achild. Now on Mirt which has had some positive effect but worst symptoms are the return to vivid dreams and the weight gain. Why can't they produce something without the bad side effects. Was on 30mg but up to 45mg and there has been a slight difference and am hoping the dreams won't be so significant. Have thought about coming off them but then I will lose the positive effect too.

"Hello,
I started a new thread because I didn’t want to impose on anybody else’s. It’s just been so helpful reading other’s experiences that I thought I’d add mine to add to the list- just in case it makes someone feel better in a ‘Me too! Me too!’ kind of way. Reading these threads has also made me recognise a few things that were going on in my body that I hadn’t initially put down to the tablets. (Just for the record, I’m a 21 year old female living in south England.)
So I’ve been on a small dose of Mirtazapine for over one month now, first half a 15 mg dose a day, and after one week I went up to one tablet of 15 mg a day. The initial going to the doctors part was the scariest: like others have said on these message boards, it IS embarrassing, (I personally kept bursting into tears in their offices for no good reason- it just felt like I was being told off, or looked down upon) and you feel like you’re wasting their time since there’s nothing physically wrong with you (or so I thought at the time…). I was just feeling sad, varying between getting stuck in a mood where I simply didn’t want to do anything except sleep forever, and screaming at myself in my head, really stupid, awful things (you know- the usual ‘just die, do it, just die you f***ing idiot, I don't know what to do I don't know what to do’) and I found myself hitting myself in the head area when I was in these moods- I got bruises under my chin and neck and had to lie about where they came from to people, which made me feel even more idiotic. Relations with people were getting strained, especially as whenever I drank alcohol I’d end up going very introverted and wanting to die. It felt like alcohol let me think clearly, and the clear thing to do was to just end it. I also lost dropped in weight to almost under 8 stone (I’m 5 ft 7) and couldn’t sleep.
But I now realise this could have been avoided earlier- as a doctor said to me, ‘you will realise there is no need to feel like this’. However, this took a long time to come about- I’ve been going to the doctors and vaguely suggesting (because of embarrassment) that I feel very down since I was around 14 years old, and the most recent doctor has been the only one to suggest medication. I’ve been to counselling which was not very helpful personally, and even remember one doctor telling me to ‘get a hobby!’ Haha…
I was hesitant to accept mediation at first because I’ve had recreational drugs at times and find (including alcohol) they usually just ‘freak me out’. I also think there’s a stigma around the idea of prescribed antidepressants. It seems like antidepressants could work like reading glasses- you wear a mild pair of glasses at first which make everything clearer, only to find after a few months you can’t read anything at all without them, so your eye prescription goes stronger and stronger until you can’t see anything at all without wearing the glasses. According to my doctor, this is not the case at all- antidepressants can work more like a crutch: they are useful to keep you calm and relaxed during a period of life stress. And when you feel like you’ve sorted your life out, it can be time to go off them.
However, I fear real life doesn’t work out that way. It’s different for everyone I assume, but to sum it up in a condensed form, I personally think I’m ‘depressed’ because; I’m introverted, find social interaction difficult yet am happier when with friends, can think very clearly and unsentimentally about the nasty, doomed planet we live on, and am not sure about what I want to do with my life- I’ve just graduated and had to move back in with my parents, and I basically feel like a stupid failure. I also pretty much dislike everybody! And I don’t see how tablets can change all that, but it definitely has helped: I feel a lot calmer, find it easier to motivate myself to do basic, everyday tasks, and instead of thinking of a million, depressing thoughts every five minutes (it was like my brain was set to destructively analyse everything at once, like a camera panning out over a wide scene) it now feels like I’ve ‘zoomed in’- and can concentrate on basic, boring everyday things. Which may be a dull way to live, but at least I don’t just want to ‘sleep forever’.
Side effects of the tablets have been (for me) heavy, heavy sedation- which is fine if you have no social life, but I find if I went out in the evening I had to skip a dose. This tended to make me feel very sad the next day. I’ve also been having very intensely vivid dreams- the dreams don’t make much sense, but they feel very real, and I find drifting off to sleep I get these weird ‘hallucinations’- like detailed pictures, faces and stuff forming behind my eyelids. That’s not so bad, it’s pretty fun- but during the first few weeks I found it really hard to wake up in the morning. It’s much more settled now, and so far I’ve only had a few nights where I’ve found it hard to get to sleep. I’ve also put on weight, which was personally a good thing but I can imagine it causes problems for other people. Personally, the tablets make me feel really, really hungry all the time and no matter what I eat I can never feel full up. I guess eating loads of fruit and drinking water would help if you wanted to keep an eye on your weight, and also resisting the urge to pile up loads of stodgy carbs on your dinner plate. Also for the first few weeks I got bad headaches in the morning, but they seem to have subsided now. I’ve been a bit irritable sometimes. Libido has decreased a little bit, though it wasn’t great to start with. My mood generally has got better, or levelled out, but how do you know whether it’s because of the tablets or your environment? I’ve just started an internship, which although is unpaid has definitely upped my mood. We’ll see when the internship finishes in a few months, and I’m jobless and bored again.
Sorry about the epic rant, but I hope it relates to others, and gives at least one person a bit of hope- what that doctor said about how ‘there is no need to feel like this’ has been the best, most relieving thing a member of the health profession has ever said to me. Face the scary doctors and let them know you need help. Meds like Mirtazapine obviously can’t fix your life, but they can help you calm down.
Oh and if you’ve been on Mirtazapine for longer than me but recognise the moods, feelings etc as being similar to mine, please let me know how you’ve got on further down the line! I think I've signed up as invisiblefriend but my account shouldn't be active for a day or so.

"Hello,
I have been taking mirtazapine for about 3 weeks now and have alot of the usual symptons like sleepinh heavily and increased appetite.
My issue is that I am still up and down. Some times I am ok, and quite calm, then I am incredibily down and unhappy. Also I generally feel quite numb. Before I used to suffer from depression and anxiety. Now the anxiety is mostly gone, but still depressed at times and feel like I am not in full control of my emotions. Also I don't seem to have many happy moments. Before mirtazapine, I had anxiety and depression at times, but at least I also had happy moments. Now I feel like I cannot be bothered with things.
I do know it takes time, but just how long? I'm scared that it will be like this for months and then I will just come off them and gone through all this for nothing.
Does anyone have any advice or stories to share.
Many thanks

I have been on Mirtazapine for 11 days and since the first one I took have been so drowsy it has been awful. It doesn't seem to matter if I take them later or earlier in the evening I am still asleep almost all the time. Does this wear off after a while.
Also I have found that I am trying to lose some weight, but my appetite has gone mad and I find myself eating anything I can get hold of or want to and think about food the whole time. Also I drink lots of water but get water retention too. Does this stay like this the whole time.

"Hi guys
I have only just found that this forum exists and it has been a revelation to me to find all of this information, and to find that other people are experiencing similar things.
I've recently been switched to 15mg Mirtazapine from 40mg Citalopram as the Cit was having no notable affect on me.
I started the mirt 6 days ago and have already put on just under 3/4 stone as i cannot stop eating. I made the comment yesterday at the dinner table that I am only stopping eating now out of politeness after having devoured the most enormous plate of food imaginable. I always have had a large apetite, despite being thin, but I'm convinced that this apetite has doubled since being on Mirtazapine.
My quandry is that I began feeling positive affects on my mood in the beginning, but my body seems to have gotten used to it. I'm still having great dreams, but my mood has dropped again. I have a review with my GP next week and feel that I should be asking her to increase my dose as in the beginning it felt like it was really working, yet I'm terrified that an increased dose will increase my apetite and weight even more.
Does anyone have any experience of affect of higher doses on weight gain?
Many thanks for your time

"I have been on Mirtazapine for so long I have forgotten when I started taking it, (I have found my memory is worse and don’t know if this is due to the medication), I quickly built up to 45mg at first but have reduced down to 30mg for the last five months, and now for the last ten days I have reduced to 15, the weird dreams seem to be worse and I get them most morning, I am also experiencing tingling in my hands and lower arms plus bad spells of cramp, [b:62d9f1b25d]does anyone know if this is normal[/b:62d9f1b25d], I want to get off of Mirt completely as although my sleep has been good apart from the dreams I am still feeling tense and on edge, not quite anxious but on the verge, when I started these I was very anxious all of the time and constantly scanning my body and surroundings for even the smallest indication that something was going wrong, I have had therapy and all of them have advised a change of job as I am better in company, currently I work from home, the wife leaves for work at 7:30 and returns about 18:30 and I spend all day alone I go for walk lunch times but don’t see anyone, I am unable to change my job as being 60 there are not that many openings paying a decent wage, sorry to write such an essay but it helps just to write it down, any suggestions on how I can lift my mood would be greatly appreciated for example has anyone tried St Johns Wart with any success or any other remedy, I have been reluctant to mix anything with Mirt but when I eventually get off them I am open to any suggestion, I have tried Lustral, Dothapine and Amitriptyline prior to the Mirt and none of these suited me.

"Hi all,
I am suffering from anxiety at work. I have been signed off a couple of times in the last 7 months and now this is the third. I just can't seem to get my balance back since my first episode of stress at work. I am afraid of work now, i loath going in each day and i feel physical sick when i walk through the door. I start the day so depressed and talk to no-one. I go into my own little world. I constantly focus on how i can't handle the job anymore and i feel as though i am not good enough anymore. It has put me completely off my job, i am constantly looking for away out. I just want to run away. After being at work for 2-3 hours i am deeply depressed and have managed to work myself up into an extremely anxitious state. This is what happened again today, i could not calm down. I called my doc and he has signed me off for 1 week with 'agitation' and given me 2 weeks of Flupentixol. I am already on Mirtazapine which he increased from 30mg to 45 mg last Thursday. I think the Flupentixol is to help my immediate nerves, and give the increased dose of Mirtazapine time to cut in.
I am so worried, i don't see how things will change. The lower dose of Mirt has not helped me, so i can't see how increasing it will be some miracle cure. I realise a weeks sick will help my immediate stress by taking me away from what is causing it. But it is not as if i can avoid work for ever, i am the bread winner a must earn a living. So i am scared that next Monday will be no different to today.
Anyway advice would be appreciate

"Hi Everyone.
I have been on antidepressants for around 8 months now. I started on Citalpram and then switched to Mirtazapine. I have been suffering from stress at work and my doctor prescribed Mirtazapine because he tells me it is particularly effective for anxiety. I went back to my doc 2 days ago because i was hoping he would try me on a different med because i am still not coping. He recommended i stay on Mirtazapine but increase the dose to 45mg.
I really hope the increased dose will sort me out because at the moment this stress/depression is ruining my life. I am so down with work i feel physically sick when i turn up each day, i can't concentrate and just have the urge to run away.
I have found Mirtazapine has increased my weight by 2 stone, but i am happy to be overweight for a while if it means i get my head sorted.
Thanks for listening

"Been on Mirtazapine for coming up to two months now, and I can honestly say it has had no effect on me at all. At the start, yes but now my sleep is messed up again, I can hardly eat because I feel sick and I am still just as miserable and nervous as I was before.
I started on 15mg for about 9 days, told my doctor and consultant that I didn't think it was working. \""We will try upping you to 30mg then and see how it goes\"" :@

"I went on to 15mg /day for two weeks when I went through a particularly stressful time, with enough to tip me over a bit. My GP upped this to 30 mg /day and have been on that dose for coming up to three weeks now. I'm not sure to what extent it has been effective as it was prescribed at a time when my mood was all over the place due to some massive stress. It certainly helps with sleep although I have had side effects of tiredeness and aching.
In the last week or so I've noticed MORE of a tendency towards anxiety with no specific reasons and been really nervous and jittery. More than I was before taking it. I was going to ask my GP about coming off it this week as I am sure it is having this effect, but reading some of the withdrawal stories on this site I am not so sure.

I have been on mitazapine for 20 months now and have no problems at all.It is a bit strange at first i just felt very tired and funny \""electric\"" feelings.This was quite perculiar but it settled after 5 weeks.I did put weight on but have now lost a stone so you can get it off ! dont use the tablets as an excuse.
Occasionally if i have missed a couple of consecutive doses i get muscle mild cramps ...usually just when i want to go to sleep.
I am feeling so much better now and this drug has helped me get over other medical problems,i will sort out coming off it at some point but i am enjoying feeling great and am sure my GP will know when its the right time.
Dont worry about the side effects it settles and i did not have any spaced out problems.
Take care and be happy !!!!!!!
My GP is great and says dont feel guilty needing a serotonin boost right now if you were diabetic you would not hesitate to take medication so whats the difference...just cus you cant see your illness.

All I can remember is taking the tablets and the next thing I remember is waking up 2 days later in some observation ward. My husband came home early and found me, I regret been found and had he come home at his usual time I woudnt be here now. I was flat on arrival at the hospital whever that means.
My medication is given to me when I need it like some child, Im addicted to diazapam and life stinks, I have planned christmas and no friends or family are invited, I will visit my grandchildren xmas morning with great difficulty and thats it.

"Hi ive been so manically depressed and have suffered with bad anxiety and real bad panic attacks since i was 18 im male now im 32 and been on all kinds of different pills , ive been on mirtazapine 45mg for about 2 and a half years , but its not working that great it does help , i would be a mess without it , but when im ill im really ill , told my new psychiatrist i wish there was a higher dose of mirtazapine cuz it just falls short and im still very manically depressed , and he said still take your mirtazapine and we can add venlafaxine aswell (now i didnt know you could take 2 anti-depressents at the same time) well anyway i said no to that cuz ive had a bad experience on that anti-d , and being in a relationship all ssri anti-d's causes sexual disfunction , and i dont want my woman to think i dont like her anymore , so he said ok stay on your 45mg mirtazapine and we will put you on Quetiapine (seroquel) aswel he wants me to start on 75mg a day but wants me to go up to around 300mg atleast then more if need be , but from what ive looked up on the net , ive read that this is a antipsychotic drug mostly used for treating Schizophrenia now i dont have schizophrenia , but it does say it can help with bipolar and manic depression and it says it has calming effects but im also on a very high dose of diazepam and zopiclone at night , but he said it will help and if i dont like the feelings i can just stop them dead , but the forums ive been on have kind of scared me off a bit , cuz as everyone knows that are on mirtazapine knows you eat loads more and put a lot of weight on , well these tablets have the same effects , everyone was saying if your not asleep all the time then your a zombie , and you also cant stop eating , now im on mirtazapine which makes you eat loads now i will be on this drug aswel that does the same , i mean im over weight as it is so taking this drug i will be obese i guess ?
I suppose im just trying to ask if there is anyone out there that takes these 2 meds together , and what should i expect and anything else that i need to worry about , at first my psychiatrist wanted me to go on lithium with my mirtazapine , but because i do binge drink (i know i shouldnt but im getting help with that too) that i would not be able to have lithium so said quetiapine (seroquel) instead , but im really worried from what ive read , some are good but most are bad i dont want to put more weight on (i need to lose a lot as it is) and also i know its not the be all and end all but im worried about sexual disfunction aswel , it dosent say on the leaflet but some people have said it does have that effect on the forum sites ive been on , i dont know what i would do with out my girl , im rambling on here im sorry ,
if anyone that is on the 2 meds can help please do as my anxiety levels are up so much just thinking about this , and im reluctant to start until i hopefully get some positive feedback ,
sorry again ,
thank you in advance ,

"Hello everyone. Am new to this forum but thought I'd join as I my doctor would like to put me on mt.
I have been on citalopram for the past 2 years (20mg), although have been on a/d for most of my adult life (am 37).
Only, my main problem is that I have absolutely NO libido at all, and when making love, my mind responds well, but my body just doesn't follow at all. It's painful even with lots of TLC & KY, and I am left burned, irritated and frustrated.
My husband is patient, but after 10 years of frustration for both of us, I have asked my GP about what can be done and he recommended that I find out about mirtazapine and decide whether or not I want to start taking it instead of citalopram.
No one is discussing lack of libido on this forum and I was wondering if this is just a non existant side-effect on this particular drug?
For all of you who are on it, would you please tell me if I am barking up the wrong tree or if I should give it a go?
Thank you in advance for your replies.

"Hi All,
After 6 long weeks of tapering down slowly, I am finally off this med.
I didnt realise just how mind numbing it made me feel, although I am taking paroxetine which has helped in the past, my gp was reluctant to prescribe again, I think because of the bad press it got.
I went to see a pysch and he presribed it and now have it on my gps records to continue to prescribe. This has took 14 month 7 different anti depressants and a cbt course, but hey I got there in the end.
I know a lot of people have benefitted from this med, it just wasnt the one for me, I have not gained any extra weight whilst I was on it.
I had my last cbt session today and am going on a 6 week life skills course and hopefully find a job in the new year with the help of an organisation called pathway, they help people who have had mental health illness get back to work.
My heart goes out to anyone going through this horrible dibilitating illness, I wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy, but things can and will get better, it just takes time a lot of time and it can be so frustrating.
Well thats me done, I will continue to read your posts and if anyone wants to ask me any questions about my experience just go ahead and ask.
Forgot to mention my problem was more anxiety than depression then turned into a social phobia.
Best Wishes love to all,
From

"Hey Guys,
Ok let me explain. Sorry for the long post
I went to my GP about 3 months ago because I was extremley sad. I often have/had feelings that i wanted to kill myself and thought of different ways to do it. A friend told me i needed to see a GP. So i went and she said i was depressed and i might have a personality dissorder.
She put me on prozac but about 3 weeks later took me of it because it was making me quite aggitated.
She then put me on Mirtazapine 15mg a day. After about 4 weeks she upped the dose to 30mg tablet a day. I have been taking this for must be about 7-8 weeks now, and i havent really noticed any difference in the way i feel.
I am currently aswell seeing a support worker and am going to be having CBT soon for my personality disorder. I have been thinking lately maybe i dont have depression at all and thats why the mirtazapine is not doing anything. It's just the PD making me feel really sad. I sometimes feel really low like i want to die and other times so happy i walk around singing.
I don't understand. Anyone?

"Hi,
I have been on paroxetine 20mg for 6 years on and off. I am on it for anxiety/panic and depression. It works very well for me. It has one major side effect-it causes me sexual dysfunction. I have little/no libido and find it nearly impossible to orgasm during sex. I do get an erection, but can go at it for hours with nothing happening-VERY FRUSTRATING. I have been with girlfriend for 8 months and we are sick of this.
My doctor has prescribed mirtazapine and reccomends I switch to 15mg building up to 45mg after a week. Does anyone have any advice? Should I swap? Is it better/worse? Does it have sexual side effects? Will I put on weight? I do a lot of fitness work, wieght training, rowing, cycling etc. Im a fitness fanatic but am very worried that it will make me put on weight. I know the withdrawal off paroxetine is bad but it will be worth it if mirtazapine works, stops the sexual side effects and I don't gain weight.
Interested to hear what people say before I decide whether to swap.
Thanks

"I am in the middle of mirtazapine withdrawal. This must be one of the worst anti depressants to come off. My withdrwal symptoms are horrible horrible horrible. I am experiencing sleepwalking, severe anxiety and panic attacks. I am taking valium to help with the anxiety and zopiclone at bed time. On Tuesday evening I caught myself going down the stairs. All perfectly logical as I was dreaming but then I woke up I'm walking down the stairs. The anxiety is harder to cope with but I'm not giving up. I'm not going back on even a half or quarter of a tablet. Mirtazapine worked well for me (apart from horrendous weight gain) Nobody told me how hard it would be to come off it. I have already tried to come off it but had to go back on it at 30mg. I know I'll probably have to go onto something else but its not going to be mirtazapine unless there is no other option. I wish I had known how hard this would be.

"Hi all,
This is only my second post, so sorry if I ramble on a bit....
Followed these boards since I started on Mirt in March, and I have to say they are such a help, especially in those moments when you feel that you're the only person in the world going through experiencing the crazy ups and downs of depression and panic!
I just wanted to get some opinions/advice as to where I should go from where I'm at, at the mo --- I was put on Mirt following detox from a serious long-term alcohol dependance (really a \""self-medication\"" attempt, to deal with depression and anxiety/panic) After a few weeks on 15mg, my PA's did start to diminish in frequency (during and after detox, I was having 2 to 3 daily) - I was briefly put up to 30mg, but had to come back down after getting unpleasant side-effects (feeling \""on-edge\"" all the time, restless legs, etc)
So I've been sticking to my 15mg every day, and while I do feel they have helped greatly with the panic (I can go 2 weeks sometimes without a PA) I'm not sure they're really doing anything for the depression --- I still wake up some mornings with barely the energy to get out of bed, and still entertain morbid/suicidal thoughts. My doc did suggest adding in Citalopram, or something similar, but I am against this, as I really dont want to put more drugs into my system. In fact, this is the reason I'm posting --- while the Mirt is, I think, helping my PA's, I do feel kinda \""drugged up\"" --- feel very disconnected from my surroundings a lot of the time, and everything just feels \""dulled-down\"", or like life has had the colour sucked out of it.
Now, as 15mg isn't really an effective anti-depressant dose (so I've been told) -- I'm starting to think that I want the drug out of my system - to try and stand on my own two feet, as it were. Trouble is, I have terrible health paranoia - (the usual worrying about your heart, etc) and every little odd sensation in my body tends to freak me out. I forgot my dose last night, and I'm feeling pretty edgy and anxious at the moment -- (little bursts of palpitations, etc) although I'm not sure if this is more in my head than anything --- could this be signs of withdrawal already, with only one missed dose?
Ok, so I guess my main question is --- in your opinion(s) -- would it be a horribly bad idea for me to try and taper myself off the Mirt? I'd like to hear from anyone who has done this themselves (it was sort of suggested in passing by my doc that I could try it, if I felt I wanted to, by taking my dose for 2 nights, then skipping a night - but at the time he didnt think I was really ready.) I would really like to be able to experience life without some kind of drug in my sytem (be it Mirt, alcohol, or anything else), but at the same time, I'm scared to death of my anxiety and panic coming back full force (it left me virtually unable to leave the house). I just feel like life is passing me by (haven't been working since Dec) - but not sure if I'm ready to actually face it on my own.
Sorry for the massively long post, and thanks in advance for your responses.

"Hi all,
It might seem off-topic but I don't really tihink so as most here seem to have the same symptoms as myself. I'm looking for an alternative to Mt as a booster drug to Venafaxine, as the Mt really made me feel queer when I took it last few weeks. I mean deadly stuff, the kinda reaction I'd have with a bout of heavy drinking or a breakdown.
Last week I decided to do something positive about it and sought the help of a psychiatrist, who, after a long inTerview recommended that she should take a closer look at my case notes and pull me in again in 2-4 week's time. I respect that, shows she cares enought to give me her time. In the meantime last week I was crippled with leg pain and back pain Wednesday eve, and totally distraught Thurs eve, couldn't stop crying violently for 30 min and totally felt like shlt that evening. So on Friday IO seen the psyc and she wa great. Immediaely after I seen my GP whom I adore. She was so upset and worried about me, my medication and my drinking that she really upset the hell out of me, since then I've been thinking about how much I've changed in the 2+ years since I'd started seing my GP that I've come to realise that I've gone from a person with some hope, but some physical pain to someone unpleasent who suffers constantly from leg/back pain, traumatic psychic pain and no hope. It's a real state of affairs which I'm dead scared of as I know where this could lead to quite quickley.
Sorry for the tail of woe, just feel so frustrated and down at the moment that I'm not in good shape. Being honest I would rather not be as live to be in such pain, such torment wasn't meant for anyone to deal with alone.

"I have phoned my psychiatrists secretary today to ask her to ask Dr J to prescribe valium to help me whilst I try to come off mirtazapine (again!). I'm really worried as last time in July I had terrible panic attacks whilst asleep, shaking crying, anxiety and very low suicidally low mood. It has taken until now to reach any sort of stability. I know that the plan is to see how I get on whether I freak or not. I just hope it isn't a plan of let's see how much the patient can cope with then she'll be begging for new drugs. Dr J goes away next week and my GP is away at the moment. It is a really busy time for me with my work moving premises and beginning of term generating extra business for us. I know that other people have had this regime work for them I also realise that valium is very addictive. Any repiles will bew gratefully received and appreciated. Pooh.

"Hi, Folks,
Firstly, I apologise if this is the wrong place to post this. If this is the wrong subforum, please move it to the correct place.
I'm from the UK and I assume most viewers/posters here are also from the UK and have an NHS doctor too.
I'll give a brief history of my treatment: I went to the doc around 12 months ago complaining of foul moods, low self-esteem, anxiety and desire to commit suicide. After explaining my difficulties with Fluoxetine and Citalopram in the past (which I abruptly and naively stopped taking due to the side effects,) I was prescribed 15mg Mirtazapine. This helped to improve my moods to some extent.
Back then I was asked to make fortnightly appointments with the doctor and after a few weeks they raised my dose to 30mg in the hope of improving my moods further. I was doing well with them except that my anxiety had remained the same as it was. I made a point of saying this every time and yet none of the doctors did anything but nod their heads ambiguously and said that the Mirtazapine [i:6f1c7f1bc5]should[/i:6f1c7f1bc5] be helping.
Now, 12 months on, I still complain about my nerves at my appointment every 2 months. I rarely leave the house, don't work and finished full-time education months ago. I don't claim any sort of benefits nor do I ask anything of anybody and I pay for my prescriptions. The docs keep suggesting to me that finding a job will help my self-esteem and I completely agree... but when I can't walk in to a supermarket without palpatations and gut-wrenching butterflies how do they expect me to face interviews, new people, new environments, the possibility of rejection and being taken from my comfort zones?
Perhaps I make the mistake of saying, \""I'm doing fine,\"" when I walk in to the doc's office because more often than not, I'm in and out of his/her office in under 90 seconds. I smile and avoid making sob stories because it isn't what the doc wants to hear and I hate disappointing people. My life situation is not making me want to kill myself but making me not want to live. (Sounds the same, but it's slightly different.)
Sometimes I feel like I'm not worth the doc's time and that I don't merit any sort of professional's attention because I cannot attribute my feelings to a life event (e.g. rape/abuse). My nervous nature also makes it difficult to voice how I feel when I do see the doc.
Does anybody else share any of these experiences?
P.S. sorry for the depressing essay.

Well what can i say, ive been on mirtazapine for 2 weeks and im already upped to 45MG.
I was/and still am if my mum has her way on 30MG.
Last nyte i had a mjor bust up with my dad and older brother, neother of them really knw wht i am going thru so my brother just egged me on alot of stuff. I basicallly wanted to kill them both and myself as i am in a depressive state.
But im only on the mirtazapine for my anxiety (which aint really easing yet), and when i was told they would help me sleep i thought great a decent night sleep without worry, Nuh Uh, i cannot get to sleep after i have taken them :? . I went to my Gp today about it all and told her everything, she just upped my dose of Mirtazapine.
I have suicidal thoughts and a wee bit of a pshycotic problem which i have just noticed in myself, and she did nothing to help. Im going to see my actual gp next week, he has a medical knowlegde in mental health so i hope i get this sorted before i start back to college next friday.

"Well the answer to this question is something I am going to find out in the next few weeks. He obviously sees an improvement in me and has aggreed that I can go back down to 15mg of mirtazapine as well as my other meds lithium and prothiaden. I expect that he was surprised to see me so chirpy. Me being only a few days out from surgery on my leg but feeling woozy and light headed. I think that I might be addicted to mirtazapine after ten months usuage and then trying to stop it by gradually tapering it off and experiencing massive panic attacks and sleepless a feeling that I was 'tripping'. So I am to be Dr Js guinea pig while he figures out what to do before I 'crash' again. (his words) He has mentioned risperidone in the past a much smaller dose to be added into the mix. I'm less scared now because I am feeling a lot better but please I do not want to experience all that anxiety panic and tripping again. Once I was back on the meds these symptoms disappeared. I know that mirtazapine is sometimes used for addicts withdrawing from drink or other drugs but addiction to mirtazapine is also well documented. I have become over weight my BMI is now 25 so this will give me a chance to lose it plus to continue swimming as I did on holiday certainly raises endorphins.

"I am still having problems with sleepiness. I have been taking mirtazapine (generic) for seven months now. I have been told by a doctor that there is no difference in the brand (Zispin) and the generic (mirtazapine) which most of us take. I am sure that there is a difference between different generics and I am sure that I am sensitive to them. I wonder if anyone else has this sensitivity to the same drug but different generics. I am quite keen to reduce one of the other drugs that I take prothiaden and increase the mirtazapine but I need to be sure of its side effects first. If I would do better on the brand Zispin then I shall ask for that. I have only ever been offered a generic and never the brand I guess because the generic is cheaper.

"Hi
I've been on Mirtazapine for around five weeks now, I started on 15mg and have now been on 30mg for about two weeks. What have I noticed? Well weight gain for one, I can't eat what I like anymore and the weight gain ISN'T due to eating more, i'm eating less and exercising more and yet i'm still 5lbs heavier than I was pre-mirtazapine. I was very sleepy for the first few days of taking Mirt but this quickly wore off. I think i'm less anxious and maybe a little less depressed. I've not noticed a major difference, more of a balancing effect. I've not reached a level of health that i'm happy with yet but fingers crossed I keep improving. Great news is that it hasn't affected my libido.

"Apart from a short break a few months ago, I have been on Mirtazapine for over 6 months now. I went back to my Doctor last week and had my dosage increased from 30mg to 45mg. I know the extra strength may take some time to kick in. I have to go back to the Doctors in 2 weeks time and fill another depression questionnaire in.
I also had some blood tests carried out as I seem to have no appetite whatsoever. Most days it's very hard to even get out of bed in the morning, even more difficult to go to work, I feel as though I don't want to be around people at all, I would rather shut myself away in the house on my own all day, call it self indulgent and wallowing in my own self pitty and misery, there are plenty of people out there who healthwise, are far worse off than me, and they seem to cope, so why can't I?
People say, snap out of it, it's just a state of mind isn't it? but is it? to me nothing else matters, I drive to work for over an hour, most days crying all the way. I can't see the wood for the trees. I have been asked if I have ever considered self harm or suicide, Maybe I wasn't completely truthful in my response because I have wondered if anybody would miss me, what is the purpose of me living this life? what purpose or point do I have?
I live on my own, I have two young children who live with their mother, I try and look forward to seeing them, they are oblivious to what is going on with me, but they ask whay their Dad is always crying, I feel terrible for even exposing them to just a part of this. I'm trapped inside myself and I just don't know if there is an answer anymore. Why do these pills not work for me? How can a pill make you feel better? What can I do?

"I was on prozac for quite a while and it seemed to help at first but then I started feeling ill again in March. I knew that I couldn't put my family through another bout of me and severe depression and I honestly don't think I could survive, or want to if, I did hit rock bottom again. My GP put me on Mirtazapine 30mgs at night and at first I was a zombie with an appetite. However 5 months later I'm feeling better than I have in a long while and sleep much better but without waking up feeling 'drugged'. I would recommend trying Mirtazapine if other antidepressants fail but it does take a while to feel the benefits and to overcome the side-effects. Unfortunately there's no quick fix for depression is there? :roll:

"Hello everyone, It was so good to see that Jo is feeling better, and there is light at the end of the tunnel.
I came back from hols and the very next day all the anxiety was back, I felt great while I was away, I can hear my neighbours having a laugh with each other, and so wish I could be like them, I have a social phobia,I have also started a cbt course, 2 weeks in, at the assesment I was asked if I would prefer to see male/female, selected female and what do I get MALE, dont feel comforttable with him, dont like his abrupt attitude, and he told me to discuss my medication with gp as mirt isnt listed as one that will help my phobia. Had a few drinks on hols, as you do, and now Im home I have kept up the drinking, I also think Im addicted to diazapine.

"I really wouldn't recommend anyone going onto Mirtazapine unless either you're in an institution where you don't have the capacity to make the decision or you have tried EVERYTHING else.
For people who Mirtazapine has worked for, I am really glad for you.
For me, I had exactly the same side effects from the first week of the medication to the seventh week, with none of the benefits. I used to take 30mg at night, and would wake up extremely weak and without the energy to actually get out of bed (\""Hungover\"" is the best way to describe it).
I was getting even less done during the day (like having a wash, tidying up, cooking) then I did before I went on it, and my suicidal thoughts increased dramatically. I would also snap really aggressively for no reason whatsover. Considering I was switched to this by my local Crisis Team, it's done nothing but made the crisis worse!
*HOWEVER* Yesterday I was diagnosed with Bipolar, and was switched to another anti-depressant along with a mood stabiliser. I already feel fantastic just not being on Mirtazapine anymore, although the side effects in my case might have continued because the medication was causing me to \""Rapid Cycle\"" from elated to depressed, quite often a few times in the same day. If you are given it as a medication for bipolar, maker sure they put you on a mood stabiliser too.
But whatever the case, if you are just about to start it, prepare to be completely knocked out, possibly for the whole duration on it! And I would recommend trying to ask your doctor if there are any alternatives!

"Thanks to everyone who asked about me. My husband thought it would be a nice break to go away in our touring caravan as I was feeling a bit better last weekend, negative thoughts where diminishing, so of we went to pick up caravan that we have stored on a local farm, only to find that it had been broken into, all the importtant things like water butt, waste water container microwave, they had even unscrewed the fire extinguisher of the wall, made a complete mess of the door and lock getting into it. Anyway after borrowing the things we needed from family we set off to Bala in Wales, I felt great , no stress or anxiety until we came to put the awning up and realised they had even robbed the curtains and tie down pegs for the awning, what low life people we have in this country.
So while we are away, we recieve a telephone call to say that a close friend has passed away, the funeral is tomorrow, which is why Im back so soon.
Couldnt relax,maxed out on diazapine, that doesnt even touch the anxiety
I was ok until last night, woke up wretching this morning, tremor is back
and the aggitation in my legs, cannot eat as stomach cannot tolerate food
so I no its not the right thing to do but I have drank a bottle of wine, just to get some relief,I know I will feel worse tomorrow but who cares.
Back to see psych on wednesday if I last that long.
T o Pooh Bear I have tried sertraline and it didnt help, my psych wont prescribe anti depressants when he knows I only have anxiety.
By the way has anybody read on one of the other forums, somebody wrote that there psych had told them buspirone was only a placebo.
Love to you all, and wishing well.

Wish I could take a mirtazapine just to get the lovely sleep i got from it, I just want to go to sleep and not wake up until its all over. Im starting to question if i actually need medication because i feel 100% worse now than i did in september when i 1st went to see my dr.
I hope the psych I see tomorrow can help as this is my original 1st appointment, not a 2o minute emergency one like the last 2.
I do know I dont want to carry on with buspirone, yes it might calm me down a bit, but it does zilch for the anxiety, Im so tired and cannot sleep,no energy through lack of food, no motivation and feel very scared.
Will let you know how i get on tomorrow.

"feeling very low and down after the events of last week. I am sleeping better but it is a very deep sleep induced by the mirtazapine. No funny turns or calling out at least not to my knowledge! My weight has been stable and I've actually lost another pound so that is six and a half in total. Whether I will be able to contiue with the plan I dont know. Had bloods taken on Monday and it looks as if my lithium will be raised although I'm not sure what the maximum level is in the blood before it becomes 'toxic'? I'm not expecting replies just posting as my overall experience.I'm still working or rather my boss is still putting up with me. As I only work part time it isn't too bad. It does require you to be on the ball I cant reallly afford to make mistakes. Hopefully I can make an upward turn again. If I felt less medicated maybe this would happen. Pooh.

Then after about a month dropped to a day on and a day off. I felt really bad - anxious and of course the insomnia was bad. So I went back to 15mg until a few days ago when I just decided to come off it. So far so good. My mood is OK, ever so slightly hypomanic. But stable. I am working - always have done on Mirtazapine.

"Hi all
Is there anyone out there who has been prescribed Mirtazapine purely for anxiety and whats been you're experience of it - its been four weeks now and I've seen an improvement in me - but its left me feeling agitated and slightly depressed - I never have suicidal thoughs though - just fed up in General with being at home but not being able to work e.t.c some days I feel like crying but it just wont come out - dont know wether this is a good thing or not.
Seems to be a rollercoaster - get rid of the pannick attacks and there replaced by agitation - get plenty of sleep and wake up unable to get out of bed but to agitated to stay there.
Has anyone had a success story that they can share with everyone. It seems that on the boards theres always so many - negative posts about meds with BTW are completely understandable, I'm just wondering if they actually work for anyone ?
I'm seeing a councillor which I find helps for the 50 minutes I'm there for - my mood tends to improve as the evening draws on as I know its getting closer to bedtime when I can get some respite from it all. Fortunately my story isn't as bad as some out there.

"Hiya - I've been prescribed Mirtazapine for severe depression by my GP. I also suffer from OCD, Emetophobia and anxiety.
I've had problems with taking meds in the past - propranolol mde me very ill, I had Anafranil which I had a severe allergic reaction to.
A lot of my OCD issues centre around fear of illness - and in particular my main worries are anything to do with vomiting or having diarrhoea. My OCD revolves around contamination and I have a restricted diet because of these issues.
I really tnk that it's got to the stage where I need some medication as I can't really cope much longer the way I am. But I'm very scared about taking the Mirtazapine - firstly because of my illness fears and worrying that it will make me ill in terms of being sick and/or the 'other' and secondly because I have reacted badly to meds in the past.
In terms of side effects how likely is Mirtazapine to give me the side effects I'm worried about? I am quite scared.

As my husband is going away next week I might do it when he comes back as I never sleep well when he is away. We discussed the possibilites of my relapsing which are quite high so ensuring contingencies are in place. He will not reduce the prothiaden which is the other anti depressant that I am on. I am hoping that I will be able to address the weight problem that I have. I am a bit nervous about reducing the mirtazapine because of the dreadful paranoia that I had as well. I dont want it to return. I will post with my experiencies. Pooh.

I have been on this now for about 6 weeks even though the drug really does seem to have lifted my depression as I was in a mess, its just the weight gain I carnt handle now. I have gained just over a stone in 6 weeks and I am only small height and this is really getting me down I am on 30mg and wondering if I can drop this dose. I too have been going to the gym I must admit my appetite has increased but just starting to feel really horrible with myself with my weight. This does seem to be common. Any thoughts out there?

"Hello, I have been taking Sertraline for anxiety for 3 1/2 years. I used to take 50mg, now on 75mg a day.
Here's the thing: on Sertraline I have no emotions. I cut down on the Sertraline a few months ago, from 75mg, and after 4 weeks on 50mg I started to feel human again. Unfortunately, the anxiety came back, and it was so bad that I went back up to 75mg.
I was recently put on Mirtazapine as well as the Sert., which seems to be fine. No real weight gain, sleeping well, etc. But I really want to cut down on the Sertraline again, this time hoping that because I'm also taking Mirtazapine, the anxiety should not be noticable.
Has anyone had any experience of this? It's hard to know what influence Mirt. has on anxiety when I'm already on a drug that alleviates anxiety. But I am so fed up with feeling like an emotional zombie.
Please let me know!
Thanks,
Chris

"Hi Everyone,
After 2 weeks on seroxat the side effects have been unberable, this med worked really well for me a few years ago, so cannot understand it, wasnt taking beta blocker or diazapine as well though back then, so dont know if that had somthing to do with it.
So, back to the doctors last tuesday, but decided to see a different one, and after 7mnth and 6 different anti deprssants Im now back on mirtazapine, its the only one I can take without severe side effects, they only start when dose is upped to 30mg. So for now I can only take 15mg, also had full blood test and am awaiting an appointment with a psych. This doctor was so livid with the other doctor I had been seeing and couldnt believe the way I have been treated these last 7 mnth. The other doctor wouldnt even let me have a blood test when I asked for one myself. just feel physically and mentally drained.
Best Wishes Everyone

"After my second night's sleep on 15mg Mirtazapine, I was very tired and sleepy. I had to take 2 days off work to try to sleep it off. After 3 days on 15mg, I upped the dose to 30 mg. Still very sleepy in the mornings. I had to get up at 5 am today to drive 3 hours to work. How long does the tiredness and sleepiness last? I don't seem to be getting any other side effects though and am feeling a lot beeter other than the sleepiness.

"hello,
i was browsing the net to look for information that could help me help my sister to get better.
she has been on mirtazapine since december and her dose has been uped to 45mg.
my mums really worried so i had a day off today and decided to get some help.
my sister has come out of an awful marriage, and is depressed.
she doesn`t sleep at all, well before she used to wake up 6-8 times a night and it disturbed everyone in the house. In the last week, since her dose is increased she is sleeping better ,but shes still very quiet and distant.

"Been on 7.5mg now for 10 days and 10mg seroxat, had to stop liquid mirtazapine made me to nauseus, so now taking half 15mg. Does anyone have this feeling in the legs, its hard to explain what its like, but it makes me feel aggitated, no patience to do anything, Not sure if its the anxiety or medication, but I just want some relief from it. Only respite from it is when I go to bed and mirtazapine knocks me out. Morning comes around to soon though, and thought of day ahead frightens me.
Just want my life back and start living again instead of existing and hoping tomorrow will be a better day, but it never is.
I never had depression it was only anxiety, panic disorder, but I can feel depression creeping in.
Sorry to go on, just fed up with it all

"I was just wondering if anybody could share their experiences of whithdrawing from mirtazapine whilst staying on other meds like lithium or prothiaden. I have heard of people posting their experiences of withdrawal from another anti depressant to go onto mirtazapine but not the other way around. I am feeling a lot better but at the moment feel a bit over medicated. I still have some symptoms of depression such as the paranoia and low self esteem. However my sleep patterns are almost normal depite still havin g nightmares occasionally. My thinking is sometimes confused and I tire easilyand dont cope well if I have too much to do. My GP said last week that I needed to be on all this medication. I'm not sure. I'll be scared that all the old symptoms would return as if they are just lurking around the corner. In my mind I can still see them but someone has put a gagging order on them! I see my psychiatrist next week and I'll see what he wants me to do.

"I too switched to Mirtazapine about 2 months ago now. I hadn't been sleeping properly for months and months and have had a viral dose of SLE. I have been taking 1 x 30mg at bedtime. The first 3 nights I slept solidly for 12 hours After the first week, I took an interest in myself again, washed my face (!) and felt more motivated to get on with things. In fact I felet great!
Second month in, I feel I've had a complete reversal to the extent that 2 nights ago I cut the dose to half a tablet and will get off them altogether next week.
I've gained nearly a stone in a month which is really awful because I've always been a size 8, so proportionately it is an awful lot! The sleep part doesn't work anymore and I have become totally paranoid about my future life and prospects to the extent where I nearly called off my forthcoming wedding in May. Only a loving, patient and understanding partner was able to sort that one out!.
My head has been, what I would describe as, Phasing (a term from the music industry when two noises are 'rubbed' side by side). My head is ringing most of the time and every time I turn my head or move, it goes 'whoosh or zoom.
After 2 nights of raking only half, the head problem has lessened and I've already lost 3 pounds without any effort. OK, so I'm still not sleeping properly, but I've figured that it really is all down to ME. I used to be a strong person and I need to find myself again and take control of all my problems and issues. I reackon only I can do that - not tablets.
Any similar experiences/ thoughts?

"Hi,
I have been taking Mirtazapine on and off for about the last 8 months.
Thought it was time to share my pesronal experience with people.
Mirtazapine is no miracle drug but for me it does work.
I had been very ill last year suffering Panic, Anxeity & Depression. I had been on Seroxat, Diazepam & Prozac and all seemed to have terrible side effects with me. The Doctor eventaully gave me Mirtazapine and the started to work straight away. The initial problems I had were the usual:
1. Increased sleep & tiredness - This helped as I would lie awake most days & nights BUT the mirtazapine is so strong at first that it knocks you for six. I was like a zombie for about the first 2 weeks. Also some very wierd dreams, some dreams amazing some really bad nightmares.
2. Increased appetite - At first this was good for me because I was getting dangeroulsy thin as I could not face food. When the Mirtazapine kicked in I ate like a horse, was constantly hungry and especailly craved sweet things.
After a while the drugs got into my system and these effects lessened.
The reason I write this post is that my mental illnes has always been a really bad stigma for me to talk about.
I found it very difficult to talk to Family & Friends about my illness as I had no reason to be ill
When this happened I was 30yrs old (Now 34) I was an Amatuer boxer, Trained 5 nights and swam every weekend. I didn't drink or smoke and eat a very healthy diet. So it proves the fact that this can happen to anybody.
Because I was boxing training at the time I would consider myself as super-fit so I kept asking - Why Me ?
I tried to pretend to people that I was not ill and constantly covered it up with some very lame excuses. I was a 12st Boxer who was supposedly a hard strong person (Body & Mind) who behind closed doors I was now reduced to a tearfull crumbling wreck.
I have tried to be brutaully honest here as things for me have got better but as with any new drug you try; it is a matter of trial & error.
I worked for me BUT might not work for you
I would also like to dismiss a few commom myths that over the years I have come up against.
[b:d89ea92a86]
These are my opions only[/b:d89ea92a86]
1. Excersice - It trully does help me BUT when you are suffering it can be the hardest thing to get up and make the effort. Try a little 5-10min walk per day and you should feel the benefits
2. Alcohol - I now have the occasional Beer or Glass of wine and I feel that it helps as long as you are eating correctly- Do not substitute Alcohol for food EVER ! - Everything in moderation. When I have a drink I have MAX 1 Bottle Beer or 1 Small Glass Wine always with a meal NEVER on its own for the sake of it.
3. Try to talk to friends & family and you will be surprised how much support you actually get. I was so scared to tell anybody but eventually I did and know at least people can understand what I've been through. I sat down with my family and friends and fully explained my situation and now they don'y make those annoying comments like \""Snap out of it\"" or \""You'll feel better tomorrow\"" Until these people have walked a mile in your shoes they can not even begin to understand just how we feel. Now I get great comments from family & friends. Even just a small \""How are feeling today ?\"" helps a lot - Explain you need positive comments not annoying quirks
The downside with Mirtazapine is that I have put on weight. So What ! I'm Happy.
I'm now back at work and when this lousy weather gets better I'm going to start training again. Things are looking up.
I would like to thank everybody in the forum for there comments over the last 6-10 months, I have only ever looked in from the outside but know I have brought myself to post my experience.
I hope this helps people out there

"I wonder if anyone could relate to my experience coming off 40mg Citalopram a night for about 5 years and switching straight to 30mg Mirtazapine a night?
Citalopram worked well for me for many years treating my depression and anxiety and virually elimintaing the almost regular nightmares I suffered from. It weaken my eyesight slightly and totally killed my sex drive but I felt they were side effects worth putting up with to feel better generally. Suddenly this year though it seemed to stop working as far as controlling my anxiety and helping me to sleep goes. I started to get palpitations, chest pain (I even got referred for an ECG as they were so bad but that was clear), anxiety and couldn't sleep (where I was at before starting to take Citalopram) without the aid of Zopiclone (which was a vicious circle as although it knocked me out well it made me feel depressed the next day) My doctor switched me to Mirtazapine 30mg a night. As soon as I switched I felt quite heavily sedated mostly all the time and when I take them of an evening they very quickly knock me out but as soon as I fall asleep the vivid, nasty nightmares start and just seem to go on and on until I have to get up the next morning. Some mornings I feel almost drunk and worry people might think I've been drinking hearing my slurred speach. On the positive side they have got my depression and anxiety under control very well but on the negative side I feel heavily sedaated all the time, have constant vivid, nasty nightmares all night every night and have no sex drive at all. Is this something that will get better with time? The things that worry me most are the constant feeling of heavy sedation and constant vivid, nasty nightmares. I feel like I'm in a catch 22 sitaution as if I stop taking them the anxiety and insommia will return but if I carry on taking them will these negative side effects persist?

"I was on fluoxetine for six weeks, it did nothing for my depression or sleep problem. The only \""good\"" side effect was I lost 30 pounds in the six weeks I was on it (and believe me, I needed to lose that weight!). The doctor has now switched me to mirtazapine, only my third day but I have had two blissful nights of uninterrupted sleep. Before, I'd go to bed and be awake till 4 or 5am. Either that or I'd get to sleep and wake at 3 or 4. Never a good restful night to be had. I'm hoping the mirtazapine will continue to help me sleep and re-establish a normal pattern. Because I've had a couple of good nights, I feel much brighter. Just hoping that finally I'm on the road to being well again.
Good luck to all the other posters, hope you all get well soon.

I have been on Mirtazapine now for about 7 months, I started out on 15mg a day for about a month, then my physc doc upped it to 30mg a day, I was doing ok on that dose but over the past 3-4 weeks it seems to be losing its effect and I am stating to go downhill fast with my depression. So they upped it to 45mg for me today, I just hope that this increased dose will sort it out and I'll start feeling normal again soon, and hope that this doesn't \""start to lose its effect\"" after a while.

"Hi I just thought I would post an update of my experiences of mirtazapine. I think that I have been on mirtazapine for seven weeks now. Most of the annoying side effects have disappeared. I am much less drowsy in the day, I sleep at night but still have trouble rousing myself in the morning. I had experienced tingly lips and numbness also unreality. These have almost gone apart from the unreality which is still here. Unfortunately I am having difficulty going off to sleep. I'm really tired but can't stop my brain from functioning. Overall my general mood has lifted but I am very irritable although this could be hormonal. I try not to look too far into the future as it causes depression and anxiety. Mirtazapine has certainly 'hit the spot' for me. How long I am going to be on it I dont know. At the moment it has helped lift the paranoia and depression at least they are more manageable now. I still have a voracious appetite but it is under control. I see the psychiatrist next week and I'll post after that.

"this post is for people that are worried or have already gained weight , i was on mirtazapine a while back and ate like a pig so i went on the web to see if there was anything herbal i could take that will stop me craving for vast amounts of food , i came across a site (ur not allowed to put website names up on here) but if you type in slendex you will come across it and i ordered some and they really do help i put weight on cant remember how much but i looked fatter so i thought why not try them there only herbal they cant hurt and to my suprise they worked , they have no stimulents in them like caffene etc, so you wont feel edgy , you take 1 half hour before food and it bloats ur tummy so when it comes to eating you cant manage a big portion and it actually makes you lose weight if ur over weight , it stops you from craving vast amounts of food as you feel full (if you take them properly) so causes you to lose weight as ur not eating all the vast amounts of calories , there website tells you everything you need to no , im back on mirtazapine and straight away i ordered a months worth , so if ur scared of putting on weight or getting fat or are already over weight please check there website out , im starting my months worth on monday as i can monitor it from a fresh week , if you are bothered about weight then go to google and type in slendex and im sure you will come across there site and just read what they have to say , all i no is they worked for me earlier in the year when i put on weight due to mirtazapine and now im back on them i wont put weight on cuz i no they worked last time , there worth looking up thats all i got to say you can make ur own minds up this is just a suggestion , anyway good luck people ,
regards ,

"I've been on Mirtazapine for 2+ months now after being on Citalopram and it not working very well.
I've gained 2 stone and feel like an elephant which is just making me more miserable.
My mood has lifted a little, but it could just be natural feeling better rather than the drug.
It does help me sleep, which is a godsend as I'm a chronic insomniac.
I want to come off the Mirtazapine though because of the weight gain, I really can't stand it, I'd rather try something different. My doctor is trying to keep me on it due to it's sedative nature though, regardless of how I feel.
Cold turkey?

"I started on Avanza at 30mg 5 nights ago, having been on Cipramil for 4 years. Weaned off Cipramil over a four day period prior to this. Monday (day 1) I could not get out of bed until 7.000pm that night. Since then, I have been able to get to a position of being able to function by early afternoon.
I saw my GP today (specialist is away for a few weeks) and he has reduced he dose to 15mg and I see him in a weeks time. He told me that it is highly unusual to start on such a high dose. He has also suggested that I take Berocca when I get up each morning.
I am starting to sleep better at night and the vivid dreams are now less threatening although still bizzare. Previously my dreams were about my work (work stress was the precipitating factor for the worsening of my depression) and were of nightmarish dimensions.
Once the drowsiness disappears each day, I am able to function at a better level then previously, so if I can persevere with this medication through the side effects, I am confident that the medication will work for me.
So far, my appetite has not increased at all, if anything I have felt less like eating than previously.

"I've been suffering from depression for about 4 months now and was changed from citalopram which appeared to have little or no effect. Last night, I took my first dose of Mirtazapine. Wow, is this drug awful. When I went to bed, I fell asleep almost immediately - nice, first time in months. However, in the morning I could not wake up, I had an appointment so had to get out of bed; I felt exhausted, confused and dizzy. My partner said my face looked puffy.
On returning home later in the morning I went back to bed and was out cold for a further 7 hours! I've had the most vivid, frightening dreams and woken up with the greatest hunger I think I've ever experienced; feel irritable, depressed, fuzzy-headed and have a facial tick.
I've just spoken to a psychiatrist friend and his advice is: \""If you were my patient, I'd recommend you persevere for another week or so, wait to see what you're like once we increase your dosage next week. We can't allow patients to chop & change their medicine at will. However, as your friend, I'd say bin 'em, get to your doctor tomorrow and change to something else.\""
If only it were that easy to get an appointment with one's GP......

"Hi all,
I have ben sufferring from depression and anxiety on and off for 2 years now. I recently was on Seroxat (Paxil) for 3 weeks til my GP took me off it due to lack of sleep and bad thoughts in the morning. I am now on Mirtazapine 15 mg (taken at night) which definitely makes me sleep but i tend to wake at 5am feeling anxious ....Hence taking a low dose ttranquiliser (Lorazepam) to counter this. It also definitely makes you hungry and I agree particularly in the evening. I also tend to feel a bit weird and spaced out particularly around lunchtime and seem to have dry eyes . Anyone else encountered this ?

"Hello, I am 24 and I have suffered with depression on and off since I was about fifteen. i have found that the bouts of depession I have are usually caused by an upset in my life, and certain things seem to trigger these off. I also believe that this time of the year can make you feel so much worse as the weather and dark mornings and evenings do not help.
I often feel guilty about how low I feel and I have not told any of my friends about my condition or the prescription drugs that I am on.
I hadnt taken anti-depressants since I was much younger again around 16, but just before Christmas I was very low so my doctor put me on citalopram, I was on this until a couple of weeks ago when I returned because I could not sleep and really did not notice that much difference. I was then put on mirtazapine which i was to take one a day for a week then start taking two aday after the first week.
These tablets made me feel really strange almost like the blood in my head would start pumping really fast, i cannot explain this feeling, or compare it to something else I had felt before. so I stopped.
anyway I know I did not give these tablets a chance to work, and i have not been back to speak to my GP although i should. I really dont want to be put on anymore tablets and I am hopeing to find another way to make myself feel better. I have extreme good days than black hole like days, I would really like these to just even out a bit.
I joined the gym a few days ago and I am going to start going everyday if I can. My gym is expensive so in a way it makes me go even if i dont want to see anyone or leave the house.
I will let you know how I get on, please let me know if you know anything else I can try.
Mia

"Hi,
At 36, I have suffered depression on and off for a number of years and just recently my GP changed my medicaiton to Mirtazapine - 30mg -The initial dose I had knocked me for 6, within an hour I was dizzy and extremely lethargic - I felt 'drunk'! It was frightening - I was in bed by 4pm that afternoon and did not wake up til the following morning- I was unable to function at my work and as soon as I returned home all I wanted to do was sleep - I really wanted my symptoms of depression to be relieved so I took another tablet and the same thing happened although not as bad but the next day it was impossible to wake myself up - At work my colleagues said I looked 'spaced out' - I refused to take any more and called my GP - She said that they did not have a sedative effect but I beg to argue - I have now been taking Citalopram 20mg daily again and am just starting to feel happier again - Has anybody else had similar symptoms??? Any advice is welcome on dealing with depression and do you think I will ever fully recover - I feel as though I have been on prescription drugs since I was 17!!!

"having had a horrendous experience on and coming off venlafaxine which was prescribed experimentally for a physical condition and not depression i was put onto zispin for depression because of my bad reaction to venlafaxine...go figure!
within a week of taking zispin i had gained 10lbs in weight (so rapid it stretched my stomach, a very uncomfortable feeling) - it actually wasnt true weight gain just massive water retention. i also lost all sense of reality.
my reaction to this stuff (or coming straight off one onto the other?) was so bad i was put on a psych ward for a few days but no admission from the doctors that the drug flipped me out - yes the drug was causing the weight gain but no the psych episode was all me. they kept me on it, i did settle down eventually although the weight wouldnt shift.
i've now taken myself off it completely by tapering for two months - halving the crumbly soltabs isnt very easy. (incidentally im sure that the soltab fizzy version of the drug causes the bloating and the mirtazepine non-branded tablets dont) anyway im all clean now, from this at least. havent told the doc yet that im off it. i've lost over a stone in a fortnight so im underweight again - i told them it was fluid!! the weight by the way didnt seem to have anything to do with how much i did or didnt eat. i have to say even with a reasonably rapid withdrawal i experienced no really nasty withdrawal effects from the drug. the weight gain sucks...what are they thinking giving this to depressed people! Do bear in mind thought that you may well lose it when you eventually stop the drug - i definitely have, and very quickly. after this and venlafaxine i will refuse any anti depressant medication i may be offered. it just isnt worth the side effects and the withdrawal has to come eventually. as for what they're meant to do i didnt notice any difference in mood but if i consider how this all started im pretty sure i dont need medicating for depression. so for me the intended effect was negligible, side effects were awful and withdrawal was ok

"I am currently on venlafaxine for depression and anxiety but am reducing this medication. I am now down to 37.5mg every other day. My psychiatrist has now prescribed me mirtazapine 30mg per night. Haven't started taking them yet as the side effects concern me and these were not discussed when i was prescribed them. The reason i am so concerned is all the problems i have had with venlafaxine - constant gastric problems. The withdrawal from venlafaxine is horrendous, it has taken me 6 months to get down from 225mg per day to 37.5mg every other day, and this is still making me ill. Wondering how common the weight gain issue is with mirtazapine, and the pains in the legs when medication taken on a night, thus preventing sleep. As lack of sleep is one of my main problems. Any advice would be most welcome. My next appointment to see psychiatrist is not for another 10 weeks so don't want to wait until then
